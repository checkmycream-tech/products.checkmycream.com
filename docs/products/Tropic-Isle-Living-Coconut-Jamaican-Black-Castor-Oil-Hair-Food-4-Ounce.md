<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Since I received this oil I have been using it and it is been very good to my scalp and my hair, I can feel the difference especially with it on my scalp thanks and the shipping was very fast .</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and I love it already.  I have only been using it for about 5 days. Will leave more details in the weeks and months to come.</li>
    <li> My hair loves it. All the natural ingrediens really work well for me. I have diabetes and am having lots of peoblems keeping my hair moisturized and jamaican black castor oil really helps.</li>
    <li> This gives my hair great sheen and a soft feel! I prefer this to the oil even though they both work well. You only need to use a little for great results. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Was looking forward to trying this product but was amazed at how small the jar is. I decided to weigh it and it came in at 4-1/2 onces. So when Im finished with the product the jar should weigh 1/2 ounce but I dont think it will I think it will weigh more like 1 1/2 ounces. So It may not be what they claim we&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright I loved the smell and it was great for my scalp but nothing special.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the bits of coconuts in it because you can see it in the hair like crumbs</li>
    <li> it was bought with another tropic isle product and they work well together</li>
    <li> My hair reacts to most products very well. However this stuff made my hair stink, very greasy, and knotted together. The product also is very hard to wash out of hair and leave your hair with an odor. I will not be buying this product again. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THIS PRODUCT GET A MORE LIQUID PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely  amazing. I use it  on my edges  because I  had braids in &amp; it literally  ripped out my hair line  but this product  which I must say is jesus in a jar literally  delivered my edges. This is a great product I definitely  recommend  it.</li>
    <li> Exceptional.  Will order again!  Gentle scent.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Works wonderful on my ,it&#x27;d kind looks fuller,I will get more for sure</li>
    <li> I love this product and my hair especially around the edges is growing back I use this almost everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a month and it actually works.  Easy to use.  Only use once a day, grease the scalp only.  You can get over the smell.  The smell is really not that bad.</li>
    <li> The smell is absolutely repulsive. I hate the smell soo much, and this surprised mean because usually anything with coconut and Shea butter smells great.. I mean the product works great so far, But I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.</li>
    <li> it would have been better if it was no lumpy</li>
    <li> I like this products!!!!  I decided after being a natural girl it was time for some hair oil and this  hair food softens  my new growth . I use this along with the pimento growth oil.  I dont rinse out my growth oil .</li>
    <li> it made my hair more greasy and gross looking. I didn&#x27;t care for it.  I would of preferred it to be more of a oil not a wax like substance.</li>
    <li> This is a great product...Great for the scalp</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this more stars but the product is very light, meaning it melts on my fingers before I can get it on my scalp good! Also I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell...</li>
    <li> The pieces of beeswax was a bit alarming. It smells just like castor oil which is a good thing because it says the product has no perfumes in it so I got past the fact that it smelled like castor oil. My hair looks good, but my scalp didn&#x27;t get any better by using this. I&#x27;d recommend putting this product in a double boiler and melting down the beeswax it&#x27;ll make life a whole lot easier</li>
    <li> Really good stuff!! Have just started using it, but it&#x27;s working out really well. The texture of the product is really chunky, but it melts in your hands. My hair feels really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Okay, in my original review, I failed to mention the smell. If your nose is sensitive, you might not like it. I have bought this product, the castor oil, and the protein conditioner. And the castor oil and this product compared to the protein conditioner, are way easier on the nose. That being said, I use this product around my edges and every time I use it my hair feels so much better, but there is a smell. With the castor oil, I&#x27;m planning on buying jasmine oil to maybe help the scent, but you can&#x27;t do that with this product. So I recommend getting used to the smell (it&#x27;s not that bad) or using it as a treatment and then washing it out.</li>
    <li> crazy FAST shipping. I am growing my hair and after tons of research I chose this product to help aid me. I enjoy the scent and am hoping they make a lip balm or lotion some day with these ingredients. I will be returning for more!!</li>
    <li> Love the oil and love the hair food. I&#x27;ll will always use the oil. Hair food feels too grainy but I can work with that.</li>
    <li> The castor oil is very thick but it dissolved very easily into my hair, the product has very good value, and castor oil is very good for the health of your hair. Try it.</li>
    <li> Well I Just Buy All Their products because there So good i Like this but i like the oil better i like this to use if im going to braid my hair and use it as grease i have greased my edges with its better than any other grease or blue magic stuff like that glad i bought it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far usually before I wash my hair.  I  do like the small size.  My hair turned white and very fine after cortisone shots for alopecia areata.  That&#x27;s why I ordered this product.</li>
    <li> not a strong smell and felt good on my scalp, i have my mom using it also. makes my hair feels soft</li>
    <li> Nice hair food, too bad it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger size.</li>
    <li> If u have a perm please don&#x27;t buy this grease it&#x27;s not for u</li>
    <li> To gritty so I ended up giving it to my nieces and they both said it made their hair thicker so I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I gave this product three stars because I honestly cannot say if it works or not. I&#x27;ve only been using it about two weeks. The customer service however, was impeccable. It shipped the very next day and arrived soon after. It this product works as stated I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way,but very pleased with results, I will continue to use this product on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> The product is of great quality. I would recommend to anyone! There was a initial mistake with the order, but the seller with their incredible costumer service team and got it solved right away! I am very happy with the overall experience with this product so far!</li>
    <li> I used this as a scalp treatment. I massage on to my scalp and brush throughout my hair. A little goes a long way! Very light smell.</li>
    <li> Product was very small than I expected and the contents were hard inside..  I wish I would have sent it back for a full refund...</li>
    <li> Light weight.... a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I RECENTLY HOT COMBED MY NATURAL HAIR.  I USED THIS PRODUCT AND IT KEPT MY HAIR LOOKING HEALTHY. ALSO, I HAD NO DANDRUFF, AS I GREASED MY SCALP LIGHTLY EVERY TWO DAYS.  IT SMELLS NICE AND I WAS GLAD TO FIND IT ON AMAZON BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS IN MY LOCAL SUPPLY STORE.  FOR ME IT IS WORTH THE MONEY TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT KEEPS MY NATURAL HAIR MOISTURIZED.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and as expected!</li>
    <li> I was really excited about this product but.......it made my hair itch and flake up so bad :( I tried it again and it did the same thing. So unfortunately I had stop using it. I have heard very great things about this but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> As soon as it arrived, I opened it up, and it had lumps all in it. I have had better oil food from Dr. Sebi, and it was cheaper. I would never buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I Didnt read the size.. I didn&#x27;t expected to be so small 😁😁</li>
    <li> I knew this product would have that wax feel to it, and found it to be ok. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again, but I will continue to purchase other items from the Tropic Isle Living line.</li>
    <li> Wow!! This scalp oil is very moisturizing for my scalp.  Considering that I have natural hair this oil is light and does not clog my pores. I normally use it every 2-3 days.  It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> When braiding my daughters hair it lays down instead of frizziness I love the product I even use it on my own hair the smell isn&#x27;t that great. But it only last for the moment the next day you can&#x27;t smell it anymore overall the product would get a 10 for me. I love it. I also recommend the oil&#x27;s!!!</li>
    <li> I like the combination of Shea Butter with castor oil. It definitely leaves my hair soft and conditioned. I used to buy real Shea Butter by itself and other sorts of oils and combine them together, but this product does all the job. I usually apply it with Cantu Shea Butter Leave-in (Cantu is first then the pomade later). Plus, when you take an amount and rub it on your hands, it melts, which makes it a A+ on my book because other pomade would not do that, this could be due to the product not containing petroleum.  I would surely buy it again and recommended to my friends and family. However, I do agree with some reviewers regarding it being a small box-thing, wish it came in bigger sizes.</li>
    <li> I love love love this product! I&#x27;m seeing improvements already with my hair and I&#x27;ve been only using JBCO Coconut hair food for a month. I see growth and luster, very pleased.Highly recommend to consumers!</li>
    <li> This is just overpriced Shea butter with unnecessary ingredients. You can whip shea butter together yourself and put whatever oil you want in it. This was a waste. I brought this with two other products sold together because of the hype and after I opened one of the other similar products I realized that it wasn&#x27;t worth buying. Wished I would&#x27;ve been able to see this in a store, opened it and read the ingredients. It would&#x27;ve stayed there on the shelf. I&#x27;m just sad that I was too busy to get a chance to return this</li>
    <li> I love this product makes my hair so soft and moisturized. Melts easily in your hair shaft, a little goes a long way and though the smell is not desirable it is tolerable. I really like this product just wish it contained more for what you pay. I will continue ordering this product.</li>
    <li> Smells like mayo. Leaves hair super oily and takes a few washed to get it all out. I still use it every so often, but I went back to the regular Jamaican black castor oil mixed with coconut oil. Less expensive that way.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very small jar for the price but it did help grow mine and my niece&#x27;s hair.  It smells ok.</li>
    <li> The shea butter in this did not agree with my scalp. Also, I wish it had more of the coconut oil fragrance in it. Was hoping for the castor oil benefits from it, but will have to try something else.</li>
    <li> I read many natural hair care websites, and they stated Jamaican Black Castor Oil was good for natural hair. So, I went on the hunt for some Jamaican Black Castor Oil. But, the only products I could find were the oil. I wanted something in a cream, and I found it on Amazon. Therefore, I ordered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropic Isle Living Coconut Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food is a cream,  which does not have a smell, as far as I can tell. When my product arrived, I sectioned my hair and oiled my scalp before going to bed. I used a small amount, but, when I awoke the next morning, my pillowcases were oily. So, if you use this product, you were warned. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair was soft, easy to brush or comb and my scalp did not itch the next morning. Would I buy this product again? For the amount you get, it is expensive, in my opinion. I wish it came in an 8oz size. So, I&#x27;ll see if I can find it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> Kind of smaller then I expected but smells great</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for two months, I still havent seen any results. I wouldnt recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Fast delivery. A++++</li>
    <li> i dont like the smell</li>
    <li> Great product, I used it right away on my hair. The smell of the product is a very lite scent</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as described. Very happy with the service; I would recommend it for people that dont my strong aromas becuase the smell is quite strong; but still effective.</li>
    <li> Brass tacks: you could just buy some coconut oil and mix in some Jamaican Black Castor Oil for the amount you spend on this TINY jar. Of course, the combination of coconut oil (which strengthens and moisturizes curly hair) and Jamaican Black Castor Oil (which kickstarts hair growth and hair thickness) is AWESOME. But, take my advice and just mix up your own concoction. I don&#x27;t think the quality of the coconut oil is quite food grade, which is what I put on my hair. I find that food grade pure coconut oil soaks into my hair faster....or, this could be my imagination. Either way, I like food grade better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot really give you my hair type as I have so many different textures, but I would say I am generally a 3a/b/c.  I also have a very sensitive scalp. This product did not bother my scalp, but it is greasy. I would suggest using very little during styling and, at night, wearing a do-rag.</li>
    <li> it was mixed well did not like it</li>
    <li> This product solved every issue I had with my natural hair:  dryness, knotting, breakage, and missing edges from occasionally wearing wigs with those murderous clips in the caps.  It also freed me from what I call \\&quot;kitchen lotto\\&quot; - blowing cash on a bunch of ingredients trying to come up with the winning combo (and the power ball is...Crisco!  The kind from England! *sigh*)    Finally, this product let me use coconut oil without being chased down by bees and castor oil without having to make like one of those ducks in the Dawn commercials to get it out. It&#x27;s not not pricey to use.  You use a tiny bit a few times a week.  Compared to the over-hyped natural hair products out there, this is very economical. Have you priced Miss Jesse or Carole&#x27;s Daughter lately??  Don&#x27;t those names sound like they&#x27;re your girlfriends?  But check the prices!!  No love there.    Now if they&#x27;d only do a 2 ounce version for airport security....    TWO MONTH UPDATE:  Don&#x27;t ask me how, but I have less grey hair now.   It has to be this product because I haven&#x27;t changed anything else.  WTH, but I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
    <li> Everything don&#x27;t work for everybody!! This didn&#x27;t work for me in no way shape  or form! !</li>
    <li> I love how every ingredient in this hair food is natural. It&#x27;s mixed with castor oil, coconut oil, rosemary, and other great ingredients. I add this to my wash process in between washing and conditioning to lock the moisture into my hair. Great product!</li>
    <li> I am aware that coconut oil is suppose to be very beneficial to the hair. However, Jamaican black castor oil is one if not the most superb oils on the market (in my humble opinion).  I have been using Jamaican black castor oil for a while now and although coconut oil on its own is alright when added to black castor oil the coconut oil lessens the benefits of the Jamaican black castor oil. I will not purchase this again. I personally believe that Jamaican black castor oil is the best oil to use on natural african american hair. Although, what works for one person may not necessarily work for everyone. You have to do your homework and find out what works best for your hair. Jamaican black castor oil combined with rosemary is also an excellent oil for natural hair. Coconut oil is basically a greasy oil and although Jamaican black castor oil can be greasy if over applied it has excellent benefits in promoting healthy hair. A lot of the natural hair care websites rant and rave about coconut oil but it has &amp;#34;never&amp;#34; did a lot for my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair food is the truth grew my edges back and nourish my hair.. on my second jar. please don&#x27;t give this a second thought order NOW!!!</li>
    <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s a Castor Oil but in a creamer form. It&#x27;s so much easier to apply. The smell is also a bit better then the usual smell.</li>
    <li> Too greasy for natural hair that is fine.. I have 4a, kinky hair. Shea butter in its natural form leaves hair greasy and dry, I&#x27;m not sure how people swear by it, I would not recommend. The shampoo and protein conditioner however are good.</li>
    <li> Awesome for the hair!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great, fast shipping</li>
    <li> I really like this size and the consistency it works well when traveling it doesn&#x27;t run and the top stays in place.  I love the product itself it works great for me.</li>
    <li> This is a little too thick for me.  It is more like bees wax and I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I gave it to my daughter.</li>
    <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery!</li>
    <li> Good stuff good 4 hot combing</li>
    <li> I love that its not the liquid kind that it usually is. I put it on my scalp and i believe its making my hair grow. Idk if i would buy again only because the product is so small and the price is kinda alot so thats why i only give 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I love Tropic Isle Living. It started when I wanted a hair product that did not have petroleum in the oil because it made my hair stringy and weighed my hair down. I also wanted something that would provide nourishment and not just a hair oil and I found the Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food. It was perfect. Then I saw there was a new product out that was Coconut Jamaican Black Castor Oil. I was excited because I wanted to see if it smelled a little different and had a different consistency. I was extremely excited when my product arrived in the mail. Come to find out, they shipped me the wrong product! They sent me the original black castor oil not the coconut castor oil. I was going to contact BeautyOnline like the paper that comes with the package suggested to send the product back but then noticed the paper also said if you return the product they will gladly replace the mistake but I would have to pay return shipping...I don&#x27;t think so. I am not going to pay out additional money because someone made the mistake and shipped me the wrong product. I just gave the other canister to my mother since I had just ordered the original castor oil anyway. So I reordered from a different company and I am sincerely hoping I get better service. The good news is that there was nothing wrong with the product, I just was not happy with the shipping service.</li>
    <li> My edges love this. I rub a little on everday. Wish it came in a bigger bottle. Excellent just the same. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Great for hair and scalp. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all.</li>
    <li> All natural, no petrolatum</li>
    <li> Not really please with the product.</li>
    <li> This project is owesome on natural hair.  I purchased this for myself and tried it on my daughters hair, I could not believe the texture change.  Our hair is much softer and it minimized the breakage to her hair. My daughter is African American &amp; Jamaican mixed so her hair is very fine but extremely thick.  This product worked so well, I ordered this for my mother.</li>
    <li> I bought this back in October, been using it consistently ever since. My hair is like a 4c texture. Very dry and nappy. In my quest for 360 waves this product has done me the most justice in terms of moisture and shine. A little goes a long way and im glad its not greasy. The texture is a bit grainy but once you rub it in your hands its liquid gold. When I run out I will probably repurchase.</li>
    <li> The product is very thick but it works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really smell the coconut but it&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
    <li> I love the hairfood and the coconut one is best, I feel like regular hairfood works but smells like a cardboard box. lol</li>
    <li> So far so good. I like the fact it&#x27;s \\&quot;natural\\&quot;. I use it mainly on my edges every few days before washing. I did use it on my scalp to oil it once, and was a bit heavy-handed, so my hair was \\&quot;greasy\\&quot;. Luckily I got my hair washed a day or two later, so it wasn&#x27;t so bad. But so far so good.</li>
    <li> I love this line of products because they are ALL NATURAL. I wish the texture of this product was smoother, but it melts in your hand after a  few rubs.</li>
    <li> I love the way it feels on my hair and scalp, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so darn grainy. I mean come on! It keeps getting on my clothes and blanket. Overall it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
    <li> Been using for almost a month now.&lt;br /&gt;Upside, Does very well with my locs, its light, gives a good shine, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell once applied.&lt;br /&gt;Downside, it doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger size container.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL IS NOT UN PLEASANT AND EASILY GLIDES  ON THE SCALP WISH THE CONTAINER WAS BIGGER BUT OTHER THEN THAT GREAT</li>
    <li> Best stuff for my very thick coarse natural hair. Moisturizes and helps my hair look great.</li>
    <li> This is a must for dry scalp. I am relaxed and suffering with dry scalp. I use this on wash day and the night before touch ups and I like it. It feels more like a paste than grease. I like that my hair stays moisturized all week. This is great for my fine strands because it does not weigh down the hair. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I was bummed when I got this in the mail. I was expecting a EcoStyler container full of this goodness, but instead I received a humble container. But despite that, this lasted me months! I love to take a small dime size amount, rub it in between my hands and apply it to a section of my hair. Everyone noticed the difference in my hair when I started using it consistently. Now I&#x27;m tempted to see if I can make my own. But it is worth it and your hair will love it. Don&#x27;t be heavy handed: a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This was very small for the price.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product for daily moisturizer, it&#x27;s really smooth and yummy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. It works well after recently wash hair as a sealer.</li>
    <li> Product is useless. This was a waste of my money</li>
    <li> Looooove this hair food. Wish the jar was a bit bigger, but a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My mother had the regular hair food with just castor oil. I tried some myself and I fell in love. I decided to go ahead and buy my own. I love this product. I hope they put it in a bigger container but from this container I can tell it will last me a while.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  I mixed it with some other oils and it changed it&#x27;s consistency and I was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> Well, Tropic Isle Living Coconut Jamaican Black Castor Oil Hair Food (TILCJBCOHF) came today. And, as I sit here trying to type this review, I am wringing wet with sweat! What???  Why?  Well, glad you asked. :)  It&#x27;s because it&#x27;s in the 90&#x27;s here, and humidity is off the charts; not even a &#x27;gentle&#x27;  breeze happening. And, my A/C broke down, and there are only a few windows that will open!!! My fingers are literally sliding off the keys as I type. But, I am persistent, if I&#x27;m nothin&#x27;, so onward I go with this review. Phew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhoo ... (TILCJBCOHF) arrived today. It&#x27;s sitting here, melted now into liquid oil. (Supposed to be more like a cream). Even my lipsticks have melted!  So, I got just an itty-bitty bit on the tips of two fingers on each hand. In other words, very, very little.  Rubbed that into my hands, and then, rubbed it into my hair.  Oh, my goodness!  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so hot where I am right now, and because my hair is suffering from the humidity, but, it made my hair, just this little bitty bit, greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sooooo, I plugged in my flat iron, and started flat ironing my hair, and guess what?  It helped!!!  Sure did!  My hair looked smoother, shinier, and even dried it out a bit.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it would be like if I was in an air-conditioned room, and the humidity was not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this stuff works!  If it will end up looking great under my current circumstances, it will truly look great in normal, or better, circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. It won&#x27;t let you down. Just remember, a LITTLE, and I mean a LITTLE, goes a long, long, long way! So, even tho it&#x27;s only 4 oz., it&#x27;s gonna last you a LONG time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go slow, and build up. That&#x27;s your best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this is sooooo long.  Guess the &#x27;breeze&#x27; from my computer&#x27;s motor, even tho warm, feels good. Couldn&#x27;t quit! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings, jd&amp;lt;&gt;&amp;lt;</li>
    <li> I used it once ,I cant get over the scent.bleh.i know castor oil is very good for hair but .I cant</li>
    <li> Awesomeeee....  Just get it.</li>
    <li> My hair is a combination of 3c and 4/a and unfortunately dry despite my best efforts. This is really good in holding in moisture, though the black jamaican castor oil works a little better for my hair type since it&#x27;s thicker and holds in moisture better. It&#x27;s not THAT greasy and is very light weight. tIt has a nice greasy feel to it (as far as greasy feelings can be nice) and its really light weight. You&#x27;ll appreciate the light weightness if you&#x27;re in summer.</li>
    <li> Was not very helpful to my hair.</li>
    <li> Is working great for my hair as well as my family&#x27;s. Helps out with dry and damaged hair. Try It</li>
    <li> Good, too early for much results. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I am using this product daily and awaiting to see some results before i can judge its effectiveness. When i see some results I will be happy to inform family members, and friends.</li>
    <li> I have a black rinse in my hair.  This product was turning my hair orange around the edges.  Probably works good if you don&#x27;t color your hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at all.</li>
    <li> Works very very well, I had dyed my hair shortly after my big chop which caused my edges to break, after applying this for a few weeks I saw that they started to grow back. People who referred castor oil for hair growth is right. The castor oil hair food is not greasy it is a very light grease treatment for your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product but its small bottle to deal with so that means you used it in small amount which i s ok</li>
    <li> Definately works. Used it on my facial hair. And now my beard is fuller than its ever been. Definately will purchase again when I run out!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. it really works.</li>
    <li> I received this as posted on scheduled date.  I have only used twice but I am pleased so far.  I will have to use a couple of more times to see if I noticed any difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair food. I love how it leaves my hair moisturized and shiney. works wonderfully on my 4c coarse hair</li>
    <li> I did not like it very much</li>
    <li> I like this products it gives my natural hair the conditioning and moisture it needs!</li>
    <li> quick delivery product is good no complaints</li>
    <li> great hair conditioning oil. I use it once a week on my scalp and nightly before tying my hair down. I will certainly keep this one in stock.</li>
    <li> This is also a wonderful product for your hair.</li>
    <li> ok this product is MAGIC .Works so freaking well for my hair.No slit ends smells wonderful and believe it or not not too greasy</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time. Great product for hair, it leaves my hair feeling soft and shiney. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product has grown my daughter hair so  beautiful and long , I love it</li>
    <li> On time! Love this product!</li>
    <li> I Love this product,works great!!! an received it quickly A+ in my book</li>
    <li> Works wonders for my dry scalp</li>
    <li> I like this product because as I am wearing my hair natural, it keeps the hair from shrinking.&lt;br /&gt;It makes all of my natural hair styles appear bold, full, and long. Whether I have my hair in&lt;br /&gt;a double twisted look, an afro, or  deep curls, all of my styles remain full. It thickens my hair and&lt;br /&gt;I like that effect. It is helping my hair to grow. I use it along with eco styler, paul mitchell moisturizer,&lt;br /&gt;and other curling gels so that I have some added moisture and again, this product help lessen&lt;br /&gt;shrinkage with all of my hair styles.</li>
