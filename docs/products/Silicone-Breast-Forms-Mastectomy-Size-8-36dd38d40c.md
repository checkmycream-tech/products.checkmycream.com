      <li>These arrived fast, in well presented packaging and in flawless condition.  </li>
      <li>my guy likes the way they look,  awesome, love em thanks, h</li>
      <li>I am a woman of color and it would be nice to have breasts that more closely reflected my skin tone.</li>
      <li>Great item with fast shipping!</li>
      <li>They do not irritate my skin &amp; are very comfortable.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>This made me feel even more confident.</li>
      <li>As a transwoman, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
      <li>They moved naturally, stayed in place on my chest, and filled out my 40C bra perfectly.  </li>
      <li>We love them.</li>
      <li>They have a nice weight and feel to them and the right amount of firmness.  </li>
      <li>They feel very realistic (as confirmed by my friend who has real boobs &amp;#62;:| ) and look great in a bra.</li>
      <li>With a mastectomy it is what ya need and will look as real as your own.</li>
      <li>As a cross-dresser I have found what I need to look just right, and are priced lower than most.</li>
      <li>and it was so helpful and straightforward.  </li>
      <li>Great quality and look fantastic and squeezing them feels pretty close to squeezing a nice firm breast.  </li>
      <li>I am wearing a 42C full cup wireless bra and</li>
      <li>But again, for the price, these are absolutely fantastic; I&#x27;d have expected to pay over a hundred bucks for something this good.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more and trying more and different sizes thank you</li>
      <li>I would not have been able to look normal again without you.</li>
      <li>they feel really good on my own breasts and give a sensation of actual big bouncy breasts.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable and looked natural.</li>
      <li>They are quite heavy, but feel great.</li>
      <li>and 9th of January I recieved them the 31st of December 6 days earlier than stated that&#x27;s amazing service.</li>
      <li>The nipples pop out from my shirt as added humiliation and make for a fun time.</li>
      <li>Making my transformation even more complete.  </li>
      <li>Lifelike.</li>
      <li>Nice breast forms, they weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, but for the money definitely would purchase again.</li>
      <li>i love my new boobies and how they feel both texture weight and softness of it and make me feel like a whole woman</li>
      <li>They are quite large but are shaped well (could be a bit fuller - rounder, but would take away from more natural look).</li>
      <li>Warmed up rather quickly and didn&#x27;t move around much.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend made a comment that when he hugged me or held me close he could not tell a difference because they felt so very real when he hugged me.  </li>
      <li>and they have the feel and movement like there real!</li>
      <li>While wearing these they move with you and bounce like the real thing!  </li>
      <li>They sure are a lot bigger than I thought they were going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>These are great and feel very natural having weight and sag a little.</li>
      <li>recommend a full cup bra as it will completely conceal the breasts.</li>
      <li>love the product, and highly advise anyone who wants to know what big breasts feel like to purchase these forms for themselves.  </li>
      <li>I find it to not be such a let down for me since I don&#x27;t really need the adhesive, all thanks to my wonderful ex-girlfriend who gave me one of her extra bras that she doesn&#x27;t wear anymore.</li>
      <li>They really do look like the real thing, but they sort of don&#x27;t feel like the real thing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these boobs!</li>
      <li>These look surprisingly real in a bra.</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise she made me wear them adhered to my chest.</li>
      <li>These things are the real deal.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>and they feel like the real thing.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money with these big girls, you will love them and not regret a second of them!</li>
      <li>but oh we&#x27;ll they look real</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d blend to your skin without a lot of makeup, mostly just due to how they&#x27;re constructed.</li>
      <li>First I must say I am a crossdresser soon to take my first steps out into public, and  this is the first pair of breast forms I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
      <li>these are so realistic and have &#x27;</li>
      <li>mainly got these for the cosplaying that I do (costume play, for those who don&#x27;t know what that is) and its kind of hard for a guy like me to look like to dress up as the characters I like without breasts, and these are the saving grace.</li>
      <li>Looking forward to seeing how they go with the new wardrobe.</li>
      <li>Very soft and sturdy construction of the forms rivals that of the $200</li>
      <li>/&gt;That being said they gave me back a sense if being whole again after losing my breast and tissue expanders after a cancer scare and staff infection!</li>
      <li>highly recommend this to any cross-player (cross-dressing cosplayer), cross-dresser, mastectomy patient, or any girl who wants an extra boost to their bust size.</li>
      <li>They do slide around a little and I would most definitely recommend the glue you can buy for them</li>
      <li>I slip them into my old bras &amp; they stay in.</li>
      <li>Of course you have to wait to heal up completely before trying to wear a wire bra.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these and will likely get</li>
      <li>As long as you keep them under a shirt, nobody will know the difference from the real thing(s).</li>
      <li>After a very very long wait they arrived, I love the feel and how they look, wished I had gotten a bigger size they did not fit my bras</li>
      <li>The nipple is very prominent, which can make it a bit awkward depending on what bra you use, so maybe get one of those cover things they sell.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t really follow the curve of your chest and can get a little uncomfortable due to sweat, but I&#x27;m still giving them 5 stars because at such a cheap price they&#x27;re WAY better than expected.</li>
      <li>Most natural breasts are usually squishy and these forms are very firm, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for</li>

<li> The set is such a bargain costing less than 1 form without nipples.</li>
<li> I have only one complaint.  </li>
<li> and they cost a lot less.</li>
<li> With a bra, they held comfortably firm against the skin.</li>
<li> I have the foam inserts too from another company which I hate because they &#x27;move&amp;#34; all around your bra and don&#x27;t want to stay in place.  </li>

    <li> These are great and feel very natural having weight and sag a little. As a cross-dresser I have found what I need to look just right, and are priced lower than most.</li>
    <li> First I must say I am a crossdresser soon to take my first steps out into public, and  this is the first pair of breast forms I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I am very pleased with them they are perfect for my size(40&amp;#34;chest, 210# 6&#x27; tall.) They fill out my 40 DD bra perfectly. Making my transformation even more complete.  Janet&#x27;s Closet is an excellent company 2 thumbs up for them I ordered my forms with standard shippingwas supposed to recieve them sometime between the5th and 9th of January I recieved them the 31st of December 6 days earlier than stated that&#x27;s amazing service. I will definitely be ordering from them again and again.</li>
    <li> Really not much to say about this, aside from how big they are. They sure are a lot bigger than I thought they were going to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly got these for the cosplaying that I do (costume play, for those who don&#x27;t know what that is) and its kind of hard for a guy like me to look like to dress up as the characters I like without breasts, and these are the saving grace. They really do look like the real thing, but they sort of don&#x27;t feel like the real thing. Most natural breasts are usually squishy and these forms are very firm, but that&#x27;s not a big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have breast forms from a different company (which were 34C size) and they had a sticky adhesive on them. These ones do not have them. Again, not a big deal for me, but some people might find that to be a let down. I find it to not be such a let down for me since I don&#x27;t really need the adhesive, all thanks to my wonderful ex-girlfriend who gave me one of her extra bras that she doesn&#x27;t wear anymore. Thank God that bra can change sizes to compensate for the larger breasts (the bra she gave me was suppose to be for about B-cups or something. I can&#x27;t remember and the printed size lettering has worn off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to any cross-player (cross-dressing cosplayer), cross-dresser, mastectomy patient, or any girl who wants an extra boost to their bust size. These things are the real deal.</li>
    <li> These breasts are perfectly formed.  My husband says they are beautiful.  I have only one complaint.  I am a woman of color and it would be nice to have breasts that more closely reflected my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I wanted</li>
    <li> My wife ordered these as a surprise. They arrived on time and for what she intended them for they are great. Much to my surprise she made me wear them adhered to my chest. They are quite heavy, but feel great. The nipples pop out from my shirt as added humiliation and make for a fun time. They are quite large but are shaped well (could be a bit fuller - rounder, but would take away from more natural look). We love them.</li>
    <li> With a mastectomy it is what ya need and will look as real as your own. I even let the boys use them as a costume and they were pleased too!</li>
    <li> As an MtF just in the beginning stages of transition, these were a gift from the heavens. They feel very realistic (as confirmed by my friend who has real boobs &amp;#62;:| ) and look great in a bra. They don&#x27;t really follow the curve of your chest and can get a little uncomfortable due to sweat, but I&#x27;m still giving them 5 stars because at such a cheap price they&#x27;re WAY better than expected. As long as you keep them under a shirt, nobody will know the difference from the real thing(s). I haven&#x27;t tried wearing them with adhesive instead of just sticking &#x27;em in a bra, but I will say from the looks of them I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d blend to your skin without a lot of makeup, mostly just due to how they&#x27;re constructed. The nipple is very prominent, which can make it a bit awkward depending on what bra you use, so maybe get one of those cover things they sell. Can find &#x27;em in any clothing store/department, I...assume. But again, for the price, these are absolutely fantastic; I&#x27;d have expected to pay over a hundred bucks for something this good.</li>
    <li> I like the produk an the serves  an ould hightrly recommend it it is everyu thing that i was told about it an came sooner than it was to arive</li>
    <li> Perfect, satisfied customer</li>
    <li> i love my new boobies and how they feel both texture weight and softness of it and make me feel like a whole woman</li>
    <li> As a CDer I am very pleased with these.  They have a nice weight and feel to them and the right amount of firmness.  I ordered 1 size larger as I have found with my body this works best.  I really like this product.</li>
    <li> These arrived fast, in well presented packaging and in flawless condition.  I am wearing a 42C full cup wireless bra and these fit the bra perfectly and fully.  While wearing these they move with you and bounce like the real thing!  As a part time crossdresser these are so perfect it makes me want to wear them more often because they are so comfortable.  Great quality and look fantastic and squeezing them feels pretty close to squeezing a nice firm breast.  I highly recommend these and will likely get a spare set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend a full cup bra as it will completely conceal the breasts.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered they were just what they said they were they are a perfect fit for what I needed I will be buying more and trying more and different sizes thank you</li>
    <li> Love them!!! The fit perfectly and they have the feel and movement like there real! I highly recommend these boobs!</li>
    <li> First of all the quality of these forms is excellent. Very soft and sturdy construction of the forms rivals that of the $200+ forms sold on prosthesis and medical supply company&#x27;s sites. Second of all, the size on these is as expected if not larger. Well worth the money with these big girls, you will love them and not regret a second of them!</li>
    <li> Great transaction! Love the product.</li>
    <li> love the product, and highly advise anyone who wants to know what big breasts feel like to purchase these forms for themselves.  delivered today and i wore them out to the market on a trial run, so to speak.  they feel really good on my own breasts and give a sensation of actual big bouncy breasts.  my guy likes the way they look,  awesome, love em thanks, h</li>
    <li> My wife recently had a mastectomy and was waiting on the fitted breast.  This silicone breast fits good and is perfect.</li>
    <li> Breast forms are the way to go if not going the SRS way.  SRS stand for Sex Reassignment Surgery.</li>
    <li> Great forms! They look wonderful! They were put to use immediately after getting them. Looking forward to seeing how they go with the new wardrobe.</li>
    <li> Great bra stuffers, lol feel great. Lifelike. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great item with fast shipping!</li>
    <li> these look like a movie prop!  and they feel like the real thing.  they get a bit sticky if worn next to the skin.  would suggest getting a breast form cover.  like them as well as my $250 medical prosthesis and they cost a lot less.</li>
    <li> After a very very long wait they arrived, I love the feel and how they look, wished I had gotten a bigger size they did not fit my bras but oh we&#x27;ll they look real but my advice is go up 1-2 sizes from your 36-40 etc size and the stated cup size! If I did not have to pay shipping and wait another 3-6 weeks I&#x27;d return them for a bigger size&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said they gave me back a sense if being whole again after losing my breast and tissue expanders after a cancer scare and staff infection!</li>
    <li> Very good product and  very good customer service ordered for a friend and she has need for them and recommend ithe product very reallistic.</li>
    <li> These breast forms felt perfect.  As a transwoman, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  They moved naturally, stayed in place on my chest, and filled out my 40C bra perfectly.  I am very happy with them.  One downside is that they don&#x27;t blend with the chest so they aren&#x27;t what you need to show cleavage.</li>
    <li> Nice breast forms, they weren&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, but for the money definitely would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used these as part of a costume. With a bra, they held comfortably firm against the skin. Warmed up rather quickly and didn&#x27;t move around much. Very comfortable and looked natural.</li>
    <li> I underwent a mastectomy this year and was looking for silicone forms that looked and felt as real as possible.  I found this company and also their online &amp;#34;instructional tutorials&amp;#34; on how to correctly size and use them and it was so helpful and straightforward.  I have the foam inserts too from another company which I hate because they &#x27;move&amp;#34; all around your bra and don&#x27;t want to stay in place.  these are so realistic and have &#x27;weight&amp;#34; to them so you will want to wear them with a wire bra for the added support.  Of course you have to wait to heal up completely before trying to wear a wire bra.  These made me feel feminine and &amp;#34;whole&amp;#34; again even though I have undergone the mastectomy.  My boyfriend made a comment that when he hugged me or held me close he could not tell a difference because they felt so very real when he hugged me.  This made me feel even more confident. Until I can undergo a reconstructive surgery these will be my &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; and I can feel like &#x27;me&#x27; for now.  I recommend to anyone who has went thru a mastectomy.</li>
    <li> These are a perfect 34DD. I slip them into my old bras &amp; they stay in.They are very good quality. They come with the nipples. So buy a bra that will hide them if you want. I had double mastectomies. They do not irritate my skin &amp; are very comfortable. The set is such a bargain costing less than 1 form without nipples. Thank you for offering them at this price. I would not have been able to look normal again without you. God bless you big time!</li>
    <li> These look surprisingly real in a bra. They do slide around a little and I would most definitely recommend the glue you can buy for them</li>
