    <li> I like this tape it holds well for men who remove there unit at the end of the day. Easy to work with, would recommend this item</li>
    <li> Glue is terrible......</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It holds the hair piece very well yet it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue. It is also easy to remove without losing any front hair. I can use it for up to 4 days. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> They keep splitting in the middle and I have to discard them. You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
    <li> I used to buy these from hair piece barber. They are the same as he had. I will continue to buy these as I need them.</li>
    <li> I realize these are for toupee useage but I use them in the theatre for stage beards and mustaches.  They are magnificent for that purpose. Much less uncomfortable that spirit gum and if you use an alcohol wipe and then a Smith &amp; Nephew \\&quot;Skin Prep\\&quot; before they will adhere better than spirit gum. You can cut them to fit the size.  The only drawback is the shiny-ness of the side that goes toward the mustache but you can cover that with a little powder before removing the back adhesive.  Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> Very good - thank you.</li>
    <li> Pink side faces out white faces hairpiece. Appears to stick better that way.  Use a little bonding glue works best for me.</li>
    <li> I just wrote a review for the small curve tape and all is well with this, too.  Right on time and plenty of them.  God bless, Ray</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick for even a couple hours. Don&#x27;t buy this brand of tape.</li>
    <li> I did not use this product as it is intended for but the adhesive is nice and sticky. It is a little difficult to peel of the red part though.</li>
    <li> Barely sticks. Last 2-3 days only.</li>
    <li> helpful with red bonding tape</li>
    <li> good product , easy to use and efficient</li>
    <li> Best liner tape for wigs on Amazon. I buy these for my daughter who wears wigs due to Alopecia. These tape liners keep her wig in place perfectly. And do NOT leave any irritation on her scalp. Great value!</li>
    <li> They work ok but I find it harder to get the red tabs off when I am putting the toupee on.I found the daily work better for me.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the low price of these adhesive Strips. Will refer others to you. Thanks again!!!</li>
    <li> The quality is very good.  I highly recommend the tape.  Did not compare price but think its very good as well.</li>
    <li> So far about every other tape I peel the back off splits in two and I have to throw it away.</li>
    <li> This tape is very sticky and stays on well. I don&#x27;t use it as &amp;#34;Toupee Tape,&amp;#34; but for &amp;#34;fashion tape&amp;#34; and it does its job.</li>
    <li> I did not realize that I needed an item that was not curved as much as thesel  They are definately more for a male toupee.  The error was mine so I cannot blame the product.</li>
