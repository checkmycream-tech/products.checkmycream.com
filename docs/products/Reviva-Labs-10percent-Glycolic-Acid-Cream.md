<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great at revealing smoother, glowing skin. My skin somehow looks more dewy and moist ( not greasy)</li>
    <li> I found this after giving up on another brand of acid cream that was always delivered rancid. I am so glad that I decided to give these creams another chance, this brand is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjuction with Retin A and vitamin C serum. I alternate the nights, and after a month of consistent use - my skin looks amazing :) I highly recommend this product - they use quality ingredients that really work and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side not, I&#x27;ve read some reviews where people used this cream to clear up their skin. I don&#x27;t really recommend doing that because the cream can be very irritating to skin that is already sensitive due to breakouts. I would advise those with blackheads and other skin issues to see a good esthetician or dermatologist before experimenting with any type of acid cream. For my skin, I only use AHA or BHA creams when my skin is clear because I&#x27;ve found from experience that they can sometimes make breakouts worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 weeks and the results are wonderful! I&#x27;ve had horrible dark marks along my chin and jaw line from years of picking unwanted hair. I opted for the 10% because I&#x27;ve built a pretty high tolerance when it comes to my skin from all the diff products I&#x27;ve tried. After not even 2 weeks my pores are smaller, skin is SMOOTH, and the dark marks on my jaw and neck are REALLY starting to fade. I would say I can see a 25% improvement already. I&#x27;ve been using every night and after about 5 days I had to skip a night and moisturize because my skin was starting to become crazy dry.  It does sting some when u first apply but nothing unbearable. I 1000% recommend this for anyone wanting brighter, clearer, spot free skin!!! And for those who may be wondering... I&#x27;m a black woman:-) It helps to know this when reading reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a review writer BUT this cream has literally changed my life! I went from every firm of pimples every single day to a pimple or two once a month.  If you have acne this is the cream for you. As far as washes go check out rx formula 10% benzoyl peroxide.  Combining the two is a miracle! !!</li>
    <li> this is my second batch of this and i love it. Nice prep for glycolic peels too. Keeps acne away</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about a year and a half and the results have been good. The first bottle caused my skin to strip. However, the new skin had less marks. Since then the results have been gradual. It no longer burns...it doesn&#x27;t strip either. Just slowly clearing. I wonder if I should get a stronger product.</li>
    <li> I was super excited to get this product. I have struggled with mild acne on and off for years and prior to using this my skin was pretty good and was just looking for an extra boost. After a month of using it, I had to stop because it made my skin break out worse than it ever had. I thought it was the initial &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; phase&amp;#34; but it was weeks into it and no signs of improvement. After I stopped using it, I was left with horrible skin that took FOREVER to get back to normal. I threw out the bottle.</li>
    <li> Not any dramatic results but I like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in hopes of finding my acne cure. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me as it did for other reviewers. My acne slightly improved but didn&#x27;t give a big enough difference. I still use it bc I think it&#x27;s helping the acne on my back. The skin on my face does feel softer though and tighter so I feel that this would work for non acne sufferers.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I bought and used the 5% cream first so I recommend doing that just to be safe- this is our face we&#x27;re talking about, don&#x27;t want to take any chances. It didn&#x27;t burn my face or feel that bad. It can be slightly irritating but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I used it every morning and even though it says to wait longer, I started using it morning and night after 5 days bc i felt that my skin could handle it. I put moisturizer on after waiting a minute. Like I said, it helped a little with my acne but not as much as I was hoping for. Before finishing this cream I ordered the 10% in hopes that it would offer more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles but love this product because it leaves my skin smoother and softer than anyother product.</li>
    <li> The usual form of Glycolic Acid in a cream for exfoliation and cell renewal is 5% and for those who have not yet approached that era of aging effects on skin  that percentage is adequate.  But for those who have &#x60;mature&#x27; or sun damaged skin this night cream containing 10% Glycolic Acid is by far superior. The treatment should be used nightly after thorough cleansing and the use of an alcohol free toner for best results. It goes on very smoothly without a greasy since, tingles a few seconds and then goes to work. (it is fine to put a moisturizer over the cream if the tingling is prolonged).  The results are very rewarding and noticeable after only a few days to a week of use.  For those with lentiges or actinic (read senile!) keratoses, the treatments take a bit longer to notice.  But this product does indeed work and it is a safe product to use. Grady Harp, July 13</li>
    <li> I can see a remarkable difference in the tone and feel of my face. It looks fresh and young again. I have been using this nightly for about a month now and I am really please. Expect you experience a minor exfoliation of the skin ( nothing drastic) . So this has become my nightly moisturizer. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> The temps have been in the 90&#x27;s and when package arrived the bottle was hot&lt;br /&gt;and cream was in liquid form.  We contacted the Company and were told&lt;br /&gt;to return and get a new one to get better results.  All packages are hot when we&lt;br /&gt;get them so we will have to reorder when weather is cooler.</li>
    <li> I use to use an expensive product with Glycolic acid but I find that this does a great job and is at least  one fifth the price of the product I used in the past. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Terrible product. This product has damaged my moms face severely. It left bog black scars on her face and also had places that bleeded.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price and delivered in a very timely manner!</li>
    <li> I might be a little too young to use this product, as it only just makes my skin a tad bit plumper and that&#x27;s it. I also highly recommend following the directions, especially if you did not use the 5% cream and dove into the 10%...like me. I put it on 3 nights in a row and got a chemical burn and it turned dark, peeled, and now there&#x27;s a slight wrinkle that looks like a laugh line (which really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal to me tbh). That&#x27;s not why I gave it 3 stars, though (I got the burn because of my own stupidity).    I primarily bought this product to help clear my skin, and it just didn&#x27;t work. Plus, it makes my skin look like there&#x27;s a greasy film over it and it makes my face feel ever-so-slightly sticky for some reason. It smells fine, it stings only a little bit (some of you made it seem like my skin was gonna drop off my face), and it&#x27;s fun to put on.  Doesn&#x27;t really do anything else for me except maybe make my skin look a little more plump in the morning (I can see how it could help for people who have wrinkles).    I would repurchase it if it was cheaper, because it honestly isn&#x27;t a bad cream and there&#x27;s a lot of product when you consider just how little you need to put on. It&#x27;s just not that necessary to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I am in loove with this product. I am 20 years old and have red marks from old acne. I have been using a microdermabrasion brush, and have been putting this product on after at night along with a moisturizer after. I&#x27;ve only been using this cream three times and already see/feel results. My new breakouts have gone smaller in size in just three days, it also made my pores smaller, and I can see the red marks fading slowly. It does sting A LOT, but it is bearable. This is a product I recommend!</li>
    <li> Better than Rx Retin-A for my skin  I have tried several products and this product gives me the dewy fresh clean skin appearance no other product has and that is saying a lot.  Prefer it over several expensive products ranging from Clinique, Chanel, Estee Lauder, etc.  I am 68 years old and have been blessed with good genes but fine lines, dullness and a few sunspots were bugging me.  Those issues are reduced at least 80%,  I had tried a Chanel skin product that has a little glycolic acid in it and noticed more smoothness to my skin so I wanted to try a stronger percentage.  Warning.... this is strong stuff.  I have had some spots on my neck that almost looked like a 1st degree burn but cleared up within 24 hours of not using it in that area.  I think this product will suffice for a couple of days a week.  I am so satisfied with the results I am going to order the lower percentage (5%) from Reviva Labs.  I think it will be comparable to the Chanel product that costs $$$ too much.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now. I am 44 years old and swear by it. I once let it run out and did not reorder for over a month. Needless to say the difference in my skin was evident within days. I find my skin is smoother and I have fewer breakouts (a phenomenon which started happening when I hit 40 - go figure!) Anyway, after using it again at night for just a week, once again my skin is glowing. Its also great to fade acne scars and blemishes. I am a person of color whose skin discolors easily, which means if I get a pimple and pop it, I&#x27;ll have a scar for several months to follow. With this cream my skin stays clear and when a blemish does show up, it heals and fades quicker. Glycolic acids can burn initially so I would recommend using their 5% cream first before this 10% cream if your skin isn&#x27;t used to alpha hydroxy acids and glycolic acid creams.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress how important it is to use only all natural ingredients on the skin.  Not only it it more efficacious (beneficial) but it is less harmful (and by less I mean -non-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feeling of putting this cream on freshly cleansed skin is amazing.  Don&#x27;t worry about stinging because it is perfecting and thoroughly purging your skin of imperfections like dead and diseased skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviva and Derma e for a great all natural complexion.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift, my friend has oily skin she feels that this has helped her in controlling her break outs.</li>
    <li> i saw no results from this after using the entire jar, so quit using it.  will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for almost 15 years, and it is the only cream i have found that will absolutely take 5 years or more off your face and throat! i will always use and recommend this!</li>
    <li> This product diminishes my dark spots and leaves my face soft and gives it a healthy glow. The product was delivered on time and as shown.</li>
    <li> This can change your skin in as little as one night. When I first used it my skin was instantly calmer and brighter the next morning. If I go awhile without using it I can feel the dead skin buildup on my face {gross!} and notice some skin blemishes. The moment I apply this at night, the next morning the problems has started to heal or go away. It&#x27;s really amazing.</li>
    <li> Works great. I use as an after shave and it helps to keep the bumps away.</li>
    <li> I am a seventeen year old with some moderate acne scars and am trying to be natural with my choices to eliminate the discoloration in my face.  I have used the product twice now over the last week after using Kiss my Face&#x27;s Peaches n&#x27; Creme AHA 8% moisturizer for about four weeks, which I used in the morning and night.  Now I use this cream at night, and it goes on thick but leaves a soothing feel to your face.  The tingling sensation has never really occurred for me, I guess I was lucky; however, I don&#x27;t have that sensitive of skin.  Their isn&#x27;t much of a smell to the cream, either, which is a plus.  Overall my skin feels better, new forming acne \\&quot;zapped\\&quot; and diminished within the next day, but I feel like it is too soon to judge the appearance of my acne scars.  I think I&#x27;ll wait six months and see.  I think the use of other natural products has aided me in a successful routine and contributed to the good effects I&#x27;m seeing, possibly as a combination with this refreshing cream.  I&#x27;m using manuka honey masks three times a week, Kiss my Face Start Up Wash cleanser every morning followed by Kiss my Face Peaches n&#x27; Creme AHA 8% moisturizer, and a nightly cleanser (Shea Terra Organics Anti-Acne cleanser) (mixed with baking soda on nights that I use the Reviva cream, to neutralize the acidity) followed by either the kiss my face moisturizer, or this Reviva cream, which I only use three nights a week.  I also use a montmorillonite or all natural organic seaweed mask once a week.  My skin has been helped tremendously.  This cream is luscious and I can definitely see the glow in my face from it, and it doesn&#x27;t react negatively with any other products :)</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Always have some at home</li>
    <li> I use this product with a Acne regimen and have been very impressed with the results.  Will buy again.  Thanks Reviva!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and researched this item along with the 5% one. Decided to go with the ore potent one expecting it to have quicker results. nNothng has changed in the condition of my skin...the allergic food reaction that has resulted in cystic acne just below my collar bone are still there. I am dissapointed in this product and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I love these products! Since using them, my skin feels and looks so much better!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter but she was unable to use it for more than a few applications because it burned her skin. I recommend you go with something less than 10% cream first and eventually move up to this one if you are considering buying.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I love glycolic acid products. This stuff cleared my pores out in no time and after the pores were clear they started to shrink. It also helps to clear up and dry up acne pimples(the ones on my forehead are gone, gone, gone after only a week). My laugh lines are virtually none existent now too. I used it before bedtime and couldn&#x27;t wait to get up and look in the mirror every morning.     The only reason I give this a four stars is that it makes my skin so greasy and I already have oily skin. I have learned my lesson to read the ingredients though before I buy and I see that this has added oils in it. I have found that I can get oil free glycolic acid (Yay!!), so that is my goal.     I do recommend this product for women who have normal to dry skin though. I didn&#x27;t find that it burned a lot, but I had already been using a glycolic acid product. It just tingled a little even when I washed my face before I used it there was virtually no burn. If it weren&#x27;t for the oil in it (or if I didn&#x27;t have oily skin) I&#x27;d say this is a girl&#x27;s best friend.</li>
    <li> Used mine to remove &amp;#34;clusters of freckle marks&amp;#34; and a couple of just dark spots.  Applied it twice a day, took about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old and I have dry skin.  I used this product for 10 days, it does sting when you first put it on.  What it did to my skin was it made it very red and very irritable, so I discontinued use and my skin is back to normal now.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old, with significant skin damage (freckles, fine line, etc.) from sun exposure.  This product burns my skin (although there was no rash).  It wasn&#x27;t painful enough to stop using it, just irritating, so I continued to use the product for a few months to see if it would have any noticeable effect on my skin.  No luck.  My skin hasn&#x27;t peeled, texture/color hasn&#x27;t changed, absolutely nothing.      The texture of the cream is nice, and it is somewhat moisturizing, so I gave it a couple stars.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It doesn&#x27;t have any parabens, propylene glycol, bht, or alcohol.  This was great for me since I am trying to discontinue the consumption/use of food and skin care products with ingredients that have alleged health risks or that are known carcinogens. In addition, I have extremely sensitive skin and some products cause me to have allergic reactions or breakouts.  But that&#x27;s not the case with this brand of glycolic acid. Please keep in mind that I&#x27;ve used higher concentrations of glycolic acid in the past to remove dark spots from some of those allergic reactions. If you&#x27;ve never used glycolic acid cream or had an acid peel before, I&#x27;d recommend starting with a lower concentration and expect initial irritation when you first start using the product.  This cream keeps my skin smooth and clear, and it practically eliminates breakouts. In addition, I recently started using 100% pure african black soap to cleanse my skin, which has enhanced my skin&#x27;s appearance even more.  Another bonus is when I ordered this cream from Amazon, I got it $10 cheaper than in-store at Ulta or any online retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 09/01/2012: I&#x27;m still using this cream and still loving it. Also, [[ASIN:B001428W6W Desert Essence - 100% Pure Jojoba oil 4 oz liquid]] is the only moisturizer I use because I can drench my face in this stuff without it causing any acne or allergic reactions. I&#x27;ve found bentonite clay to be helpful too as a face mask or as finishing powder over my makeup to keep the oiliness away. I am continuously finding that the more natural and organic a product is (whether for skin, food, or house hold cleaning), the less likely I am to have an allergic reaction. Plus, I just found out I&#x27;m pregnant and I don&#x27;t have to worry about eliminating products that are unsafe for the fetus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/20/2013: I was on a hiatus from using this product for about 5 weeks.  At around 29 weeks pregnant, my skin became extremely irritated by everything that touched it (I was surprised because I didn&#x27;t think my skin could get any more sensitized than it was, but I was wrong!).  During this time, whenever I applied the Reviva glycolic acid to my face, it would intensely burn as if I&#x27;d never used glycolic acid before. I&#x27;m sure it was one of the inconveniences of my hormones fluctuating due to the pregnancy. However, once I noticed that things were getting back to normal, I resumed using the product at about 35 weeks pregnant.  I&#x27;m now 39 weeks pregnant and haven&#x27;t had any issues and I&#x27;m so happy because my skin truly suffered in appearance until I resumed usage. Now I&#x27;m feeling confident again and looking forward to meeting my little one face-to-face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with hormonal acne for years. This is the first product I&#x27;ve found that has improved my acne significantly! Start by mixing a small amount into your normal moisturizer and gradually build up. Other wise it will sting your skin.</li>
    <li> This product definitely contains a fair amount of glycolic acid. You can feel it working right away after you apply it. However, after more than one month of use, I see no visible change in my facial skin whatsoever. The only change I have noticed is that my hands/fingertips are dryer and scalier from using them to apply this nightly, despite the fact that I wash my hands with soap and water immediately after. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product, saw results within a week.  Takes very little amount on each application.  Will buy more!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the long term effects, but after 2 weeks I have seen a slight difference in the discoloration, and lines on my face. It has also gotten rid of my break out I was experiencing from the depo shot. It doesn&#x27;t burn my face as others have stated, but I was previously using 5% from another company. I love that this is not a oily product and has a slight clean fragrance. I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Super stuff and great customer support from OxKom on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t rate this product fairly as I just started using it and I take it that my complexion will require time to improve.</li>
    <li> This is the first time that a write a review and I hope that those that have stains on their face as I have will give a try to this product. I am a woman of 40 years and after four pregnancies I could not get rid of those terrible stains on my face anymore. Especially during summer. I tried many different products before, but this is the only that gave me visible results. The first couple of days, my skin was more sensitive, so I used it with my mosturazing cream for about 10 days. I have been using it for about 3 months now and I love it. For the first time, after many years, my skin looked homogeneous. I still have some more resistent stains on my cheen, but the most are gone. Will keep purchasing it!</li>
    <li> I can not believe that it has taken me so many years to arrive at this product.  How many times have I walked past this item at health food stores without a second thought.  So finally, I have been divinely lead to this product, surely at the approprpriate time for my skin to handle the product.  Well, let me just say \\&quot;FABULOUS\\&quot;.  It has been 3 weeks of continued nightly use of this product and my skin is luminous, my fine smile lines are almost completely gone, my pores on my cheeks that I thought would never close, are tightening and closing, and old belemishes are fading.  I am so pleased with this product!  If anyone is contemplating, give it a try.  It is so worth it. I have tried way to many different products and treatments and none have given me these results. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Love it! I got my mom and daughter some too:)</li>
    <li> Over time, I noticed my skin becoming really uneven and kinda dirty looking, especially in pictures. I had heard about people using glycolic acid to help their skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works! After a solid week of using it (every other day to make sure my skin got adjusted to it) my skin looks 10x better! I get compliments on my skin all the time. Hyper pigmentation and dark spots was always problematic, but this cream helped clear them up a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have a ways to go before my skin looks how I want it to, but it&#x27;s well in its way. Shipping only took about a week, so the process was really speedy. Buy this product, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I am 31 years old with extremely acne prone skin and cystic acne. The oils in this product are 100% noncomedogenic and this product does not cause me to break out.  I tried this product because I want something natural to help with acne marks and fine lines. I jumped straight to the 10% based on these reviews. The first time I used this I was breaking out terribly and so upset. I woke up in the morning and all of my acne was flat (no longer inflamed) and the redness reduced. I thought it was a miracle. So I kept using it every night (which was too often!) and had bad results until I figured out how to balance my usage. If you use it too often without adjusting to it, your skin will almost get a thin, hard, dry, red layer on top and no surprise, this will cause you to break out (which is why the company recommends starting at the 5% level). If you take a day or two off the red/dryness goes away and you can start over (I never peeled, but did have dry flakey skin from overusage until I found my balance). I found that from the start I could do 2 nights on, 1 night off. Now I am up to using every night and that has been the perfect balance for me. I would recommend starting with every other night if you haven&#x27;t used the 5% version first. This product dries up pimples and gives your skin a nice glow. It hasn&#x27;t 100% stopped my acne, but I have had severe acne and it is MUCH improved. I would compare the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; effect to the effect you get from a slight sunburn on acne, it flattens acne and makes your skin look great (people with acne you probably know what I mean), however unlike a sunburn this is not damaging to your skin. As long as I do not overdo the usage and use a good moisturizer, it is great for my skin. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Love the price point.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the few products that meets my high standards for what I put on my skin. I love that its cruelty free and has very few ingredients, the best part is it works. I&#x27;ve done a lot of research for a natural, cruelty-free product that would help with my acne. I&#x27;m 27 and sick of having mild to moderate acne but when I use this product it definitely improves. I use it once every night and in about 2 weeks I saw a big difference. It does take some time to get used to and it does sting a bit, work your way up starting with the 5%. I used to put on another moisturizer underneath and use it only a few times per week. I can now use it every night with only a little bit of stingy sensation, but its definitely worth it. I started using it last year and got compliments all the time, when I ran out I didn&#x27;t order another pot and my skin definitely lost its glow. So I ordered another pot recently and it&#x27;s now improved back to where it was, maybe even better. I also use a salicylic face wash by burt&#x27;s bees which also seems to help. I am still getting some acne right before my period so I&#x27;m looking for something else that might help more. Despite that I still highly recommend this product, even if you don&#x27;t have acne, it will help smooth out your skin tone and give you a beautiful glow.</li>
    <li> I live in New England so this cream is too dry for me specially in winter time, I have to use pure Emu oil on top. It&#x27;s a perfect combination! I see excellent results within a few days of uses. Before, I used to use Shiseido Advanced Bio-performance cream for my face, my skin gets used to it for a few years, so I need to change to new line Shiseido Future Solution in order to ease my skin in winter time and reduce wrinkles, they are excellent products, and too expensive! Now I found Reviva 10% Glycolic Acid Night Cream and pure Emu oil products even better results and just at 1/10 cost. I&#x27;m happy with the quality results and the cost!!!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty potent, and quite effective. Being a sceptic, I was honestly surprised at how well it worked. It definitely evens out skin tone, and lightens blemishes/ brown spots. As long as you can put up with the slight tingling that comes with every application, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with the results, and will find that it&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good cream for the price. I have noticed my skin being smoother. I have had a few breakouts and sometimes it tingles when I use this cream, but all in all I will buy this again. I also purchased the MD Forte and it has the same amount of glycolic in it, but doesn&#x27;t tingle and is triple the price.  Although, I do really really like the MD Forte, if this has the same amount of glycolic and is cheaper it wins out, but the tingling and burning might be the ph level which most creams don&#x27;t list. I hope with continued use I will get compliments on my skin like other reviewers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 49 yrs old and 8 months and people think I look like 35. I have use this product for quite some time now and had not reorder a yr or so ago. My pores started opening up and I saw my old bottle in the bathroom.  Started using it and the very  next day those opened pores were gone. My skin is as good as ever.  Really great product.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 10% strength cream but received the 5% strength.  Already ditched the box it came in before I realized I&#x27;d received the wrong item.</li>
    <li> It does burn a little bit, but it&#x27;s a good burn. My skin is slightly sensitive (cannot use benzoyl peroxide without getting horribly puffy eyes), but have had nothing but great results with this cream. I put it on at night and can really see and feel a difference the next morning. My skin is so soft and has a refreshed look. Just make sure you don&#x27;t use this 5x a week or your skin will really start to peel.</li>
    <li> Works great for acne scars/discoloring.</li>
    <li> Works great. It cleared my skin up in 2 days.  Be careful and make sure you don&#x27;t put too much on because it will make temporary marks if you do. You should feel nothing to a light stinging but not burning.  I recommend starting out using just a little and then build your way up.</li>
    <li> I have always used a high end name brand moisturizer until now.  Met a doctor on a vacation trip and he was telling me how Glycolic Acid is the only ingredient that is effective on anti aging but that it has to have at least 10% of it.  Have been trying it for one month so it&#x27;s too soon to formulate an opinion.  However, I do like the glow on my skin though.  My husband had a tingling sensation in the beginning and didn&#x27;t really care for it but he persisted and the tingling is now gone and he seems to like it as much as the high end name brand.  I would love to have this product work as it is A LOT less expensive than the other ones we&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Really great product! I tend to have acne prone skin, especially during the time of the month. Acne that I would get would leave dark blemishes that would take forever to go away on its own. I was looking for a product to speed up this process. I had gotten glycolic acid peels done in the past with success, but they are so darn expensive done professionally! I tried this cream, and WOW!!! My face has never looked better. I have used it every night before I go to bed for almost 2 weeks. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, so wearing it every night doesn&#x27;t bother me. It does sting a little, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable. I have not had one new acne form since wearing this every night. I was my face with tea tree cleanser from body shop, and then apply this on right after. It has done wonders so far and I cannot wait to see how my face looks in a month from now!</li>
    <li> I am usually very lazy about writing reviews unless I absolutely love or hate something.  This cream I LOVE.  Mind you I&#x27;ve only had it four days, but in FOUR DAYS I&#x27;ve seen a dramatic improvement in my skin!  About my skin?  Blotchy from sun damage and acne scars.  It&#x27;s been horrible having to deal with all this after living 30+ years with great skin.  Suddenly it all changed in my 30&#x27;s and I was dealing with adult acne and then hyperpigmentation from skin over-exposure.  Ugh.  I hated wearing all that concealer and face make-up but had to!  I also refused to spend hundreds if not thousands on laser treatments, etc.  For me that was just submitting to being gouged by a greedy industry.  So for the past few years I&#x27;ve tried various products promising this and that.  None of them ever made a real difference...until this cream!  Like I said: OMG.  I am thrilled!  And if this is what happens after only a few days I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens over the coming weeks.  My skin is brighter, the scars are diminshing and the texture is sublime!  It truly feels like magic in a jar.  If I&#x27;m dreaming, please don&#x27;t wake me.  Wow.  Btw this cream did not sting me at all.  I felt a minor sensation for about 10 seconds and then nothing.  But that&#x27;s just my experience.  I know some people claim it does sting, so be very careful about not using this cream with open pores until you know your own skin sensitivities.  I wish you all equal or better results!</li>
    <li> I dont recommend that for any body ,, I used it for 3 weeks but I didn&#x27;t see any effect !</li>
    <li> This is a powerful product. I recommend starting with the %5 at first to see how your skin will react.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I did and I still had unsightly skin peeling with the 10%. Use sparingly.</li>
    <li> Great for my acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This works so much better than the expensive stuff I purchased from my dermatologist... And much more affordable!  ;)</li>
    <li> After using this product for several months I have to say WOW! Not only has it helped fade my past breakout hyper pigmentation marks, but my skin is super smooth in morning (after I apply nightly). I also use this on my husband who has very oil skin and large pores. His pores look much smaller now. I did not use the 5% Glycolic Acid cream as a starter because I already exfoliated my skin daily with a chemical exfoliant prior to buying this. So, I figured my skin would tolerant is and it did. This is a must try!</li>
    <li> OMG, I just can&#x27;t describe how I love this face cream! All the blemishes and pimples are gone, my face is so soft and never looked better. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I really like this product,does what I expected and the price is affordable,it is a keeper,noticed results in two weeks</li>
    <li> love this stuff.  read this is the minimum % that should be used for beginning.  have used.  stings a little.  use about 3 times a week.  love it.  prepping skin for my first 35% glycolic peel.  will purchase from seller again.</li>
    <li> was using the 5% and it did wonders, then i wasnt getting the tingle anymore and got the 10%. i have seen a dramatic change in my complexion since applying the cream.  love it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face cream.  The glycolic acid content is great - but the cream base it&#x27;s in is equally wonderful.  I recently switched from another glycolic acid product I had used for years because of the availability, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin which has always tended towards oily has dried out quite a bit - this product gives it just what it needs to look more youthful.  And even better, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
    <li> I looked long and hard for cruelty free products that worked for my skin.  I had several instances of buying a product only for it to severely irritate my skin, or make me break out.  The line of Reviva glycolic acid products are now my very favorite.  I use the toner, the cleanser, and the cream, on a daily basis and I break out much less than I used to.  I really love this line of products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some reviews of this product that said it was very harsh to the skin.  I did not find that to be true for me.  Granted, I had already been using the 5%, so my face was used to this treatment.  But after using the 10% for a couple of weeks now, I can tell you that it did not burn or irritate my skin any more than the 5% does.  If you slather it on heavily, it will sting slightly, but its only temporary.  It produces good results for me.  It softens and smooths out skin texture and imperfections.  It&#x27;s also good for acne.  I can even tell a slight improvement in fine lines &amp; small wrinkles.  Nothing is a miracle cure for aging, but this stuff really helps hold back the clock some!  The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I haven&#x27;t found the 10% to be much better than the 5%.  They both seem to work about the same for me.</li>
    <li> This works well.  I went straight for the 10%, first time use, my face was only slightly red at first.  I&#x27;m careful with it, and have had no extreme reactions. I only use occasionally though because it does seem a bit harsh, but that&#x27;s its intention.</li>
    <li> I use Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream as an exfoliant to help fade post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on my acne-prone, dark brown skin. Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream is a lightweight, cream-colored, moisturizing cream. The oils  used in the formulation -- sunflower and safflower -- are non-comedogenic. Every other night, after cleansing and toning, I apply a small dab of Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream to my skin (avoiding the eye area). I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer on top of the cream. After using Reviva Labs 10% Glycolic Acid Cream nightly for the past couple of months, I&#x27;ve noticed the following changes in my skin -- increased softness, increased smoothness, decreased pore size on cheeks, faster healing of acne and **decreased hyperpigmentation**.    FYI - Wear sunscreen daily because glycolic acid makes your skin photosensitive. Also, use of glycolic acid is not compatible with waxing or sugaring as a hair removal method.    Ingredients: water, 10% glycolic acid polymer (sugar extract &amp; rhubarb extract), pumpkin extract, peach extract, sage extract, comfrey extract, chamomile extract, witch hazel extract, vitamins A, vitamin D, vitamin E, safflower oil, sunflower oil</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly. I use it at night before bed after my skincare routine. It does sting a little, but the next morning my skin glows.  I&#x27;m using it on my face and chest nightly. Its my secret skincare weapon. People always mistake me for at least 6 years younger. Don&#x27;t use this product if you&#x27;ve just scrubbed or peeled your skin or if you&#x27;ve had sunburn. It does burn sometimes and you might see peeling the next morning.</li>
    <li> Especially good for getting the skin adjusted prior to a more powerful skin peel.  Slight tingle.  Every other day application.  Skin ends up baby soft</li>
    <li> its stings my face at first but a week after it works perfectly on my skin , but a bit oily , but who cares you just apply this night time</li>
    <li> Pretty effective if you use 2-3 times a week for 10-15 min to remove dark spots. For sensitive skin Apply moisturizer before applying glycol acid cream or risk mild burn.</li>
    <li> This works really well.  I am used to glycolic acid so this strength was not a problem for me.  I use it a couple of times a week and it makes my skin seem fresher.  I am not sure that it does anything for wrinkles but it does affect the texture and tone of your face.  It seems to clear the skin up from ruddiness and make the pores smoother.</li>
    <li> I have combination to oily skin.  And, I realize that a Glycolic Acid cream helps to prevent breakouts.  I bought this night cream three weeks ago and started using it every other days.  Now I am just using it once or twice a week.  And it works pretty good.  The cream feels a bit thicker than my preference, but it&#x27;s not a problem.  The good thing is that it works.</li>
    <li> As described. Good seller.</li>
    <li> I had always had a spot or two on my face but once I hit my early twenties I suddenly found my skin a battleground strewn with every type of acne you can imagine. I had white heads, I had black heads, I had papules and pustules, and I had cystic acne. All of this around the jaw and chin like a damn beard of pimply shame. It got to the point where I hated looking in the mirror and constantly considered darker thoughts because how could I live like this? I was afraid to go bare skin at the beach, camping was a nightmare, I hated taking my makeup off at the end of the day and I never wanted my husband to see my bare face. Even if I had ONE day where I didn&#x27;t have an active break out, I had horrendous hyperpigmentation and since I am extremely fair, it was really obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add to that the damn quest to find something, anything to calm my persistent hormonal acne. I tried birth control, I tried antibiotics, sulfur washes, prescription creams, and finally accutane. NOTHING. NOTHING WORKED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago I stumbled upon this product and read the reviews and thought &amp;#34;Well... Why not?&amp;#34; In a MONTH my acne was gone... It took care of everything. You know those stubborn flesh colored bumps that you can&#x27;t squeeze and seem to never go away? They were gone. I am still amazed at how much I like my skin. I still have a lot of scarring but everything is finally healing and I&#x27;d much rather deal with a few scars than a million angry bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this product does have a bit of a burning sensation but it&#x27;s not going to give you a chemical burn, you kind of just have to deal with it until the tingling subsides which lasts maybe a few minutes. I use this after I thoroughly cleanse my face of makeup. I use an oil cleanser for makeup mostly around my eyes then I use a gentle wash to remove the oil and remaining foundation. After that I use the ROC resurfacing disks every other day which you can pick up for about 10 bucks at the drug store. I have completely stopped using any sort of exfoliating product with beads or nuts or any of that crap because they just irritated my skin. I find that the ROC pads gently exfoliate and really get rid of dead skin cells. After that I put the glycolic cream on and if I feel that my skin needs extra hydration I&#x27;ll put on a night cream. That&#x27;s it. With the exception of the gylcolic cream, you can get everything else from the drug store for under 10 bucks. In the morning I wash with a gentle wash again and then put on sun screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. My acne is gone and my skin is now fairly normal (it use to be very oily). I&#x27;m not at the point where I would go out without foundation and concealer but the topography of my face is smooth and I&#x27;m using far less products to cover up my skin. I&#x27;m hoping that the hyperpigmentation (which is also benefiting from this cream) will be gone by summer so I can just enjoy a light, fresh face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about getting this product, just try it. For less than 20 bucks it might completely change your skin. If not, I really hope you find your holy grail product someday because I&#x27;ve been where you&#x27;re at and I know how it feels.</li>
    <li> This is nice cream. I like the tingle when it first goes on but it is not harsh enough to cause severe redness (at least not on me). It is absorbed very quickly into the skin. The skin feels very soft and smooth afterwards. The only problem is I&#x27;ve gone through it quite fast!</li>
    <li> it was not all so good.</li>
    <li> I paired this with amlactin alpha-hydroxyl cream for the bumpy scars on my arm and it&#x27;s amazing. The cream really works and the price is great!</li>
    <li> I tried this hoping to even out my skintone. I used it 3 times as directed and was left with rough patches of skin that are sensitive.....even after a week! I hope the skin improves there over time. I will not use this product on my face again.</li>
    <li> Effective product. Saw it working the next day, slight peeling, not too much that you will look crazy tho. It BURNS!! for around a minute. Used 3 days in a row then took a 2 day break. its working like a charm. Dark spots from adult acne fading away!! took off a star because it really stings and the packaging is somewhat cheap looking.</li>
    <li> Very powerful agent. It will lighten your dark spots by regenerating skin covering it and sealing it until you can peel off the effected area. It will sting open wounds, and be super careful when putting it anywhere near your eyes. The spot  you apply it too can get itchy after a while (part of the healing process). It peels off usually 3- 5 days later. If you peel it off too early your skill will be raw and you will have to reapply and wait over again. It can also cause certain spots to get worse and your skin can react to it with a red rash at times. Applying it before bed is a bad idea since you can wipe it off on  your pillow and then rub your eyes against the area which will sting like crazy! Its best to apply in the morning and then put sesame oil over it and then a non perfumed lotion. I use it as a healing agent against blemishes to remove the scab faster. You only need to dab it on your skin, if you over apply your face will feel like a stretched prune and your face will show lines in wax!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream because I&#x27;m having problems with breakouts even in my thirties. I&#x27;ve heard great things about this cream so I was excited to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t start with the 5% as some suggested which is probably what I should have done. When I use this cream it has a really strong stinging/burning sensation. I now put moisturizer over the really sensitive areas and reduced the frequency of how often I use this cream. It&#x27;s around two nights a week now. I also no longer put this on my neck as that was a big mistake. Over one blemished area it made the skin raw. I haven&#x27;t noticed any dramatic results but will continue using this cream until I&#x27;ve finished the jar. I haven&#x27;t written it off yet so am going to give it more time and hope it smooths the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty strong.  I used the 5% previously and felt it might not be strong enough, and this definitely does the job and one can feel that it is working after just a couple of days, as far as getting rid of dead or rough skin.  I am just over 60 with good skin, but need some sloughing and this does the job.  It does sting, and it is very hard not to get it on your lips and then they hurt and feel very chapped and it is hard to get it off, even if you put salve or balm on them.  I thought it might be causing my face to break out but I am not sure and am still experimenting, while not using it every day.  A mask or a scrub might work better for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Use it daily and it works great my skin has never felt better.</li>
    <li> I used this product for roughly say 3-4 weeks. It burns when u first apply it , but after a while its fine, there has been no improvement in the acne scars or dark spots on my face. it gave me some hyperpigmentation around my mouth area and I had to return this product, total junk. I hope my hyperpigmentation fades away. I am  really scared to try anything new.</li>
    <li> I have only used it three times in 2 weeks.  I was going slow and it says to apply 2-3 times a week.  I did so and didn&#x27;t notice any flaking or pealing of my facial skin.  But all of the sudden it happened.  My face started to flake slightly, I assume removing top layer of damaged skin from many years of destroying it in the sunny California sun!  If I remember, I will update this post as I use it more.  But, seems to work good.</li>
    <li> Still using Rebiva Labs 5% and planning to step-up to 10% when I have used all of my 5%.&lt;br /&gt;I know someone who uses this product and she looks way younger than 62!&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works for me the same way.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and easy to use ! Cured my acne at age 50 !!  I will use this 5x/week for the rest of my life !</li>
    <li> I love that this cream is so thick because it goes a long way.  I use it daily as an eye cream and on my decolletage.  It also works great as a hand and foot cream. Actually, it works great on almost any part of the body and it makes my skin look amazing!</li>
    <li> Repeat order of this product.</li>
    <li> This product is powerful, so build up to using this cream. This certainly helps to slough off dead skin and calms breakout la very quickly. It&#x27;s too strong for my skin to use everyday, so I add to my routine 2-3 times a week at night.</li>
    <li> I use Glycolin Acid Cream to control acne in my face and really works. I don&#x27;t have that problem any longer.&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night (2 or 3 night in a row) skip 1 or 2 nights.&lt;br /&gt;This cream is wonderful.  I really recommend it for acne problem.</li>
    <li> It was missing a chunk of the cream</li>
    <li> I have used this product for some time. It provides very good facial exfoliation.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really removing layers if dead skin in an even manner. I have shaved my face for years, and feel I&#x27;m getting the same results from this as I did from prescription retin A. No, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard (: I&#x27;ve just found this technique (one I learned from a dermatologist) to be an easy method of removing dead skin. This cream burns a bit when I first put it...10 to 20 seconds max. It&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t handle, considering the results.</li>
    <li> Great Glycolic acid for a really good price</li>
    <li> Glycolic acid really works.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 2 containers so far, with great results on facial bumps (raised oil cells).&lt;br /&gt;The bumps don&#x27;t completely disappear, but they are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Without dermatologist or plastic surgery, this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream based on the reviews that I read. I started using it about 4 days ago and I noticed that the lines on my forehead are much smoother, my skin is tighter and softer The greatest change is my neck, I&#x27;ve lost 5 yrs at least This product is amazing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;You will fell some tingling and slight burning when you first apply it but it dissipates quickly if you resist the urge to touch your face.&lt;br /&gt;This will be my age defying staple for the next 30 yrs.&lt;br /&gt;order it!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream. I had heard that 5% doesn&#x27;t do much so I went ahead and went straight to the 10% one. It tingles and stings a bit when you first start using it or if you use it too often but it&#x27;s nothing unbearable. I have combination skin and some acne and it helps keep my skin clearer and helps my zits heal faster. I was hoping it would get rid of my blackheads but I think I might need something more powerful for that to happen. It does seem to help prevent new ones from forming, though. Just make sure that you don&#x27;t use it too often or else it will dry out your skin. I use it only at night about every other day and that seems to work fine for me. Hopefully as I get older it will help prevent wrinkles too!</li>
    <li> I liked the product and felt &amp;#34;the tingle&amp;#34; so I believed it must be doing something... I didn&#x27;t see any changes in wrinkles or old acne scars though.  I would consider buying it again.</li>
    <li> I am 35 with clogged pores/blackheads as well as some mild wrinkles. I use this cream every night and I am slowly seeing improvement in my skin with smaller blackheads and fewer bumps. My skin is overall looking brighter and healthier and my skin tone is evening out. I can&#x27;t say yet if it is helping my wrinkles but I imagine that will take longer.. I occasionally do an actual peel using the  &amp;#34;Skin Obsession 20% glycolic acid peel&amp;#34; for a heavier peel. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if your skin is not used to peels or you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok..don&#x27;t notice any change in my skin</li>
    <li> Pro&lt;br /&gt;1. it&#x27;s not terribly expensive&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1. The bottle was not sealed when it arrived&lt;br /&gt;2. This product is ok as a body lotion but did absolutely nothing for my skin. I used a whole bottle over a month on my arms with no positive results. I know a lot of wonderful things are written about this product (one reason i decided to try it too), but unfortunately I saw no exfoliating or any other desired result. Maybe my skin is tough but I do not recommend this product for any other use than as a simple moisturizing body lotion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 and use this for my night time cream, and I absolutely love it! Really helps with my adult acne (both black/white heads and cystic). I noticed a huge difference right away!</li>
    <li> Huge fan of this cream. Awesome. Was MD Forty fan forever via dermo, then they stopped making it. I was looking for something new and couldn&#x27;t find anything, then found this. This is great cream. I use it every other night!</li>
    <li> Although I did not get the peeling effect that I wanted, I am pleased with the moisterizing effect of the product. I am using it every night now and still do not have any peeling.</li>
    <li> FIRST: If you are trying this product for the first time, purchase the 5% instead. The 10% will most likely irritate your skin!&lt;br /&gt;Now for the great review... I have been using this product  (after from transitioning from the 5%) for over a year and I have no plans of quitting. I&#x27;m almost 32 but people consistently believe I&#x27;m years younger (usually 25). I firmly believe I partially owe my youthful look to using this product! Fine lines disappear, acne breakouts diminish drastically, skin tone improves, and your skin still stays moisturized. Here&#x27;s hoping that they never change a thing about this miracle moisturizer!</li>
    <li> So the ingredients have changed.  SD 40 Alcohol, polysorbate 60 and stearic acid  are  among the new ingredients now added. It doesn&#x27;t even say 10% glycolic acid polymer like the old bottle. It has a lot more oils added to it as well. I tried some on and it feels different. Tackier in consistency. I really don&#x27;t understand why companies always change a great product and mess it up. I hope this doesn&#x27;t break my skin out. Oh well. I&#x27;ll have to look for the original somewhere else.</li>
    <li> I bought this glycolic acid cream at The Vitamin Shoppe and it changed my skin completely!&lt;br /&gt;Two years ago I came off of birth control pills (I&#x27;m 25 now, have been using it since I was 18) very abruptly, which was a very bad idea since my hormones went crazy and gave me horrible acne all over my face. After suffering with it for about a year and a half, my coworker suggested glycolic acid and since I was willing to try anything I quickly bought it as soon as I could. After only two weeks my acne decreased and my it seemed like the skin on my face was becoming stronger.&lt;br /&gt;This cream burns/tingles like crazy at first, especially if you have active acne, but if you mix it with moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel that bad. I started using it every other night after washing and toning for about a week, then I started using it every night.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cream since April and even my acne scars are fading now. It does help decrease redness from acne, but I would also suggest using some retinol as well if you have acne rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give this a shot if you have adult acne and endure the burning/tingling for at least a month. You will not regret it!</li>
    <li> could tell a difference in my skin after first treatment. Skin appeared firmer, smoother, pores smaller, overall more radiant. Just what I wanted it to do.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but after two applications of this product my face is already clearer and smoother! My make up goes on a lot more evenly and my pores are tight! I don&#x27;t yet know if it is going to fade my hyper pigmentation but I have very optimistic expectations. I will continue to use this product religiously! The sting after application can be a little shocking but after you know what to expect it is a piece of cake!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! Yes, it stings when first applied, but only momentarily. My skin is radiant and is commented upon frequently. Since it is an acid and everyone&#x27;s skin is different, it is a personal determination on how often to use it. For me it is every other night. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t do reviews but this lotion is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am the kind of gal who shops at grocery stores and Walgreens for my cosmetic products and lotions.  Now that I am turning 36, something in me clicked and I said to myself that I better start taking care of my face/skin!  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or anything but I feel I have blotchy skin and def defined pores.  So I saw the reviews on this and thought I would try it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW... OMG... I am so glad I did and I will say I will NEVER stop using it.  My skin is smooth, pores are smaller, less blotchy etc.  My mother told me my skin looked like porcelain LOL (with make up on) but she saw me today and told me my skin was glowing (no make up on).  My husband has made tons of comments too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was just me noticing but I guess not.  LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON... Yes is stings a bit but you were told that in the description so just prepare.... stings for only like 5 seconds... BUT DO TEST on under side of arm as suggested on bottle.  Then I tested a small spot on my face... when I had no reaction, I used all over my face and stings for a few seconds (reminds me of the movie Home Alone when he puts the after shave on and screams LOL)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DEF recommend... Love it.!!</li>
    <li> I found it too irritating and gave me 2 dozen little whiteheads. Don&#x27;t use of you have acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> Terrible burned the crap out of my skin too strong use dans aha better for scarring .</li>
    <li> Just received.  Packaging and shipping were very good.  Trying it now, but gave 5 stars.  if it does not work out, I will come back and update this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!! I will never be without it! I originally bought this for stretch marks, but I started putting it on my face and love the results!! I started using it at 27 (I&#x27;m 29 now) because I noticed some fine lines on my forehead. The lines are significantly reduced (which I think was this,  and I&#x27;ve been taking hydrolyzed gelatin - green pastures brand), and my skin is always smooth and glowy - even in winter! I use this every night before bed. Sometimes it stings a little, but that means it&#x27;s working, and it never causes redness or irritation despite the sting.</li>
    <li> Well this cream definitely made me peel :) but I like to do a healthy peel now and again to get rid of the dead epidermis layer.  It was most effective the first time I used it and I REALLY shed but now my skin has adjusted to it and I have to use it more often to peel.</li>
    <li> It has been a month and my wife has not noticed any changes.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t say how long it would take to show results.</li>
    <li> Like every thing in this world read the instructions first.  I have now used this product for 2 weeks and I have noticed a difference for the better with my face.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! My skin feels so soft and my pores look smaller! My skin is not sensitive so I can handle this product as when I apply can be very itchy but as soon as it dries it goes away! I think is worth all that itch for the visible results I get from it! I use it only at night because I feel like it can be a little bit too much to use it in the morning and nights!</li>
    <li> Great cream, no more acne</li>
    <li> Postmenopausal whiskers drive me crazy. Could see the offenders but they defied easy removal. Concluded, after years of gouging my skin to extract them, that I needed to attack the layers of mounting skin cells to make whisker removal less damaging and more productive.&lt;br /&gt;In that quest I searched and used a myriad of exfoliating products. Even direct peels. But this is the only product that has rescued my skin from daily assaults and satisfied my obsession to be rid of any discovered whiskers. Frankly, I can hardly believe it.&lt;br /&gt;It IS strong and should be applied with caution. If it&#x27;s your first encounter with glycolic acid, don&#x27;t start with this level.</li>
    <li> This cream is the bomb dot com. If you want to exfoliate your skin this will do it. It helped me through my really bad acne skin days. It can burn and sting at first but after a week or two it will go away and reveal smoother softer skin, Thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I not only love this review for it&#x27;s results, but they&#x27;re free of animal ingredients and they don&#x27;t test on them! PERFECT!! After researching and finding out that most professionals use glycolic acid in their chemical peels/etc, i decided to try a more mild form of it over time, and I&#x27;m super happy I did. My skin texture is definitely smoother and any dark marks have faded. I have olive Mediterranean skin, so most scars turn dark. For example, if I get a blemish, when it heals, it leaves behind a dark mark for up to 4 of 5 months before it&#x27;s completely gone, which SUCKS!!! However, I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since May 2013, and a lot of the older marks are completely gone. The only noticeable ones are from recent break outs, which are have decreased dramatically, but I still get a blemish here or there every few weeks or so. This is my second time buying this product and I truly love it. Oh! and as for the burning sensation, if you have any blemishes or areas under a healing process, for me it burned a little more. But on perfectly fine, healed skin, it didn&#x27;t burn at all, so not only does it depend on the person, but also the condition of your skin. All in all, WONDERFUL, CLEAN product worth having as a beauty product. Even if you have perfect skin, this will prolong the wrinkling/aging process and truly keep your skin looking its best for a long time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in healthcare and knew the day would come to reverse the damage I did with the countless hours sunning. This product strips off those nasty sun spots. I also had chicken pox from a patient two years ago, and this is helping with the few pox marks on my face. Be careful to not use this more than 3 days a week to begin with or you will fry you flesh!  I&#x27;m happy with the results. I gave this to my daughter to use on acne scars. It says so much to me when she continues using a product because she&#x27;s a doctor. At 47, my skin has yet another chance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an issue with facial acne for most of my adult life. This stuff works miracles. After 8 months of daily use, I&#x27;m on my third container of this magic elixir. The areas of discoloration from previous spots over the years have all faded away. No new pimples for months and my skin is calm and happy. I wish I would have tried this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is simple and it has worked miracles with my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 2016&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list has changed on the container I just purchased. The box is new and the jar is the previous formulation.&lt;br /&gt;:(</li>
    <li> I use this cream regularly. I like that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients. My daughter robbed me of it because she has discovered it helps a lot with her acne.</li>
    <li> Never got to use it much. Seemed alright when I did but I can&#x27;t speak about the results.</li>
    <li> I waited after months of use to review this. What its helped me with is acne healing. If I pick my acne and I have a scab (not fresh/forming acne), I put this on and it heals it and makes it flake away without leaving a red scar, that normally would last for months. I didn&#x27;t work my way up to the 10% either. This was my first experience with glycolic acid. With the first use there was some sensitivity but I applied it right after the shower, when all my oils were stripped...so that contributed to any discomfort. I wouldn&#x27;t say it retextured my skin as I still have my visible pores and whatnot. But it helps with acne scars/scabs. Also, make sure you wash your hands after using.</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions and use it with care (it can burn up your face!), its great stuff.</li>
    <li> Hands down my very favorite beauty product. Truly does fight wrinkles and blemishes at the same time. Be sure to wear sunscreen if you use this product though, as it does make my face very sun-sensitive.</li>
    <li> great product, excellent exfoliant, will burn, but it has vegetable oil so leaves the skin soft, i like that its not scented, after 3-4 uses the skin will start peeling, but not in a very noticeble way, i think they recommend to use it 3X / week, but its tolerable to be used everyday, i personally use it twice a day because my skin is used to acid peeling. i would definitely re-order  it in the future.</li>
    <li> You only need a small amount. Works great.</li>
    <li> Received today exactly the date you said it would be delivered.  Correct items delivered.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  I use it a couple nights a week as I think it can be taxing on my skin with daily use.  Been using it for months and it still stings when I put it on.  Will try something else when I run out.</li>
    <li> I so super love this cream.  First off I&#x27;m 36 and although I take good care of my skin and avoid the sun I&#x27;m still getting older and the turn over rate for my skin is slowing down leaving me with a less than stellar looking face.  I use this to encourage the skin to get rid of dead stuff and make some new!  I only use it occasional, just when I notice my complexion starting to look a little tired maybe or just not as fair and fresh.  It also helps with some small occasional breakouts.  This is my go to product for the week right around my period.  I will use it maybe every other night for a week and then once and a while for a boost.  Since I don&#x27;t use it religiously I have never had peeling.  Sometimes it does pack a tingle but after 10 minutes I&#x27;m fine.  I did not start with the 5% but I have bought some acid peels before at Sephora but wow they are so expensive and as we age ladies we need them more and more often!  The price for this bottle is still less than what I paid for a 3 time use peel at Sephora and this bottle will last me 3-4 months probably.  I was having the worst acne for the past 10 years until I finally realized that make up and lotions with strange chemicals like demethicone(sp) were like 80% of the cause.  So I switched to an all natural mineral powder and use Essence lotions which are all nature and this acid cream and wow, finally I don&#x27;t have to deal with that problem any more.  Also I have long hair that I wash every other day and I put oils in it so I make sure to change my pillow case every week.  I recommend using a white pillow case cause I found that on nights I used this my pillow cases with color would bleach out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a solid month, every night and I love the results. My skin isn&#x27;t bad, I&#x27;m 34 but my skin looks like it did 10 years ago.  I bought this to get rid of a dark area on my face (melasma) but it didn&#x27;t really make it lighter. My skin is really soft and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions advise putting it on every other day in the beginning but i didn&#x27;t listen. I had some tingling in the beginning but my skin came out okay in the end.</li>
    <li> Tried cream for the first time today. I am use to retinol, retin a and aqua glycolic cream,so I thought I could take this cream real easy.  I was amazed when it began to burn my face.  It&#x27;s good to know it will work.  If this is a type of cream you are looking for I would give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this from Vitaminshoppe but so happy to find it much cheaper from Amazon. For people with extremely sensitive skin then I would suggest starting off with the 5 % and slowly building up their skin for the 10%.When I first bought this months ago I was doing it all wrong which led to chapped skin and break outs. Here are the steps I now take and finally see all the positive results this Acid has to offer.  Start off by using it twice a week with a few days apart. Then you can increase to 3 times a week if you want.   DO NOT put any near the eye area and DO NOT use  large amounts of this cream for your face. A small amount is all you really need as it rubs on nicely. Too much in one application can burn the skin.  Secondly, DO NOT apply any comedogenic creams or oils over the Glycolic Acid. Because this cream does tend to dry/chap sensitive or dry skin you MUST apply a good moisturizer a few minutes after applying the Glycolic Acid as is recommended. Even though I adore Argan Oil (0 comedogenic rating)  and Rosehip Oil (1-2 comedogenic rating) I must admit they dont work well with Glycolic Acid, at least not for me. So the days I use the Acid I use Raw Organic Shea Butter which has a zero comedogenic rating and is excellent at moisturizing the skin. So far no more chapped skin or break outs. I take some Raw Unscented Shea Butter (Alaffia Brand) and rub it between my hands to soften it up and then rub it on my face. Good quality SB will melt into your skin and never clog pores. This Glycolic Acid really works as long as you use it the proper way  and arent allergic to any of the ingredients. And yes , this cream does sting/burn a little when first applied but immediately subsides.   *Also try not to use on any open wounds or any pimples that have just popped..it will sting badly!!</li>
    <li> Wish I got a higher percentage but this was the safest level to start off with. It does fade my scars overtime and I don&#x27;t have to be consistent but it does help to be consistent for quicker results.</li>
    <li> My skin is the definition of problem skin. I&#x27;m 21 years old with active acne and a number of dark marks, I&#x27;ve tried all the lightening serums which helps but didn&#x27;t do much. This actually fixes the root of the problem. Glycolic acid speeds cell turnover which is great for skin. I&#x27;ve been using the product for about a week and a half and already see promising results. I broke out a little bit on my cheeks but nothing to be embarrassed about. Also a little drying so be sure to moisturize.</li>
    <li> Loved, loved, loved this product. My only complaint was that it  finished too quickly. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really an acid cream because most of the acid creams I&#x27;ve had in the past actually peeled away layers from my skin. Regardless I still think this product is worth a try.</li>
    <li> after i got this product the box was opening .a lot of ppl bought this product in amazon and gave them five stats for the review, but not good as i thought.</li>
    <li> I am 47 &amp; you see overnight results - your skin will wake up fresh, rosy and smooth! AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keep using it and even blemishes vanish ( i am prone to that on the T zone)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is an amazingly cheap for what it delivers - i used clarins, YSL , and other nonsense&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only fear is that they take it out of the market at some point and i need to stock on it</li>
    <li> Very good. If you are acne prone it is a must have. Just DON&#x27;T overuse it! I apply it 2-3x/week. More than that can be drying and once I tried every other night and it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; my skin (I mean, irritation, and small &amp;#34;red zits&amp;#34; all over my face! ) Less is more! FYI my skin is very sensitive and very acne prone and I&#x27;m 36 years young ;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other glycolic acid creams before. This one is my favorite. It&#x27;s light, non greasy and unscented. It does a good job of softening fine lines and lessening dark patches on my face (for reference, I am 47 years old with combination skin). I did not have a problem with sensitivity when I first started using this, but my face was used to other glycolic acid creams already. I alternate this cream with a retinol cream (for maximum effect) and get moderate results. Would recommend without reservation. **Update: With daily use this product does still work, but it dried out my combination skin a little. I now layer it with a light moisturizer and have had no issues with dryness.</li>
    <li> I love this. It does what it says. I have sensitive skin so I am careful with this. It worked on my ingrown hairs that I HAD on my legs. I have to buy another because someone took it from me after seeing how well it works lol. Research it to see if you should use it for whatever.</li>
    <li> When ever I buy glycolic cream I know it&#x27;s good quality when I feel a sting because I have really sensitive skin, but this cream only barely stung at all. I usually buy Alpha-Maximum 10% Glycolic Acid which works like a miracle cream but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stock. Overall, this cream is just ok.</li>
    <li> I apply this to my face to lighten dark acne pigmentation and to my hips&#x27; stretch marks. It does sting for a few minutes but I just apply a thin layer. I apply a lotion to avoid dryness. I noticed that it dries my acne. I haven&#x27;t seen much lightening on my stretch marks but it&#x27;s just been 3 weeks. I will continue applying it and observe for changes.</li>
    <li> OMGGGGGGG!!!! This product is just simply amazing. I suffered with bad acne since I was 15 years old. I tried everything such as pills, creams etc. But I have to say...this product got rid of my bad acne, shrink my pores and even my skin tone. I use this only at night time and every morning, i see better and better results. It&#x27;s just incredible!!  I&#x27;m almost done with my first jar and will order a second one. If you are dealing with bad acne, you should definitely buy this product. I&#x27;m African-American and this product works great !!</li>
    <li> Within the first couple days I noticed a difference. The dark area on my forehead and nose/ upper lip from sun damage completely lifted. I would have been happy there. I have used it for a month now. My fine lines are reduced a lot. My complexion is fresh and moisturized...all the  time. My skin looks brighter. I don&#x27;t need foundation anymore!!! I will just spot cover under eye circles and small marks that are still fading. It hasn&#x27;t changed the size of my pores but my face is not as oily as it used to be so now I don&#x27;t notice my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed I break out less. And when I do they go away fast. My skin has not looked this great in almost 10 years. I am 33..worshipped the sun for a while. But you can&#x27;t tell now :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff will be a regular in my routine for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ll continue using it.</li>
    <li> It seemed to break me out after using. I was only applying every other day in the interest of acclimation. I had better results using a glycolic wash previously. I think maybe this was just too strong and staying on my skin a longer period of time did not agree.</li>
    <li> This cream works great for wrinkles!  This is 10% potency which is what I use now but I started out using 5% first since it can make your skin &#x27;tingle&#x27; if you aren&#x27;t acclimated to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks but haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change, but it may be too early yet.  Last night I decided  to use it in combination with a topical vitamin C cream and that combination showed a very tiny change in smoothness and clarity.  I have used the Reviva on my elbows and it worked there but the lines in my face are well earned so it&#x27;s going to take some time for them to lessen.  I feel I should review this again after two months and maybe then there will be some significant change to report.</li>
    <li> Works very well for me.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The ingredients, the smell, the results... I know some people who use it multiple times a week, but I use it only once or twice a month on average and it keeps my skin smooth and &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;.  So cost effective that I have given half a container away because my sister-in-law was so in love with the results after just 1 use.</li>
    <li> great at home acid peel. gentle effective.  Now on 3rd bottle</li>
    <li> Burns my face…in a good way.</li>
    <li> I have only used it three times so it&#x27;s too early to tell.  If it is like any other Reviva products I know it will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Long time Reviva  User.</li>
    <li> Great way to clear up the acne, and smooth away the wrinkles and shrink your pores...I&#x27;ve used this for years.  When I look in a magnification mirror, I can see the difference of how smooth my skin is where I allply the cream around my eyes every other night compared to where I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It works to remove dark spots on face.  Keeps face with a flawless look.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: PLEASE READ: Previously I gave this product 5 stars and raved about it&#x27;s near miraculous results. My original review was left intact below. Unfortunately, I need to revise my opinion and issue a warning to anyone using this or considering buying it. It does indeed produce amazing results. My drastic change of opinion took place when some of the cream unintentionally found it&#x27;s way onto the sensitive skin under my eyes. Perhaps it was transferred via the pillow at night or was smeared by touching my face inadvertently. The skin became inflamed and swollen and even after subsiding has left the skin looking horribly lined and wrinkled. That single detail has aged my appearance 10 years.  It is extremely upsetting and frustrating. In my previous review I gave the obvious advise to remember that this is an acid solution and to treat it with respect and caution. I believed I was doing that, but the ease of accidentally smearing the cream to areas not intended, in my opinion are not worth the risk and damage it can do. Perhaps using it only during waking hours in the evening indoors, is an alternative in order to receive it&#x27;s benefits. Whatever your decision as to using it, I am only writing to stress it&#x27;s damage potential and to never under any circumstances allow the cream to be placed on that very sensitive and thin skin under your eyes. I hope the manufacturer or associates will not flame this review with \\&quot;unhelpful\\&quot; votes as punishment for my honesty. Also perhaps over time the mess under my eyes will lessen and be less noticeable. But this is a dangerous acid product and use it at your own risk. Please note also I have never given any product a one star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Perhaps nothing else influences the perception of age and health as much as the appearance of our skin. Glycolic acid, one of the mildest forms of alpha hydroxy acid, and a naturally occurring compound in sugar cane, aids in exfoliation and promotes healthy cell growth to replace the outermost layer.  As a precaution, I purchased Reviva 5% Glycolic Acid Cream first to acclimate my skin to it&#x27;s effects.  I used it at night after gently cleansing the skin to allow it to penetrate more easily. To err on the side of caution, I left that milder cream on only 20 minutes at night before rinsing it off, making sure there was no excessive reaction or burning, and gradually increased the time until it was left on all night. I noticed results even after a single week of use with my skin feeling softer. When I felt my skin had acclimated, I ordered this higher 10% concentration and followed the same gradual exposure schedule. My main concern was darkened sun spots on my forehead that I hoped to lighten or even eliminate. After about a month of combined and gradual use, I am astounded at how effective this cream has been. The spots are at least 50% lighter and I feel certain that they will, in perhaps just weeks more, be gone completely.  In addition, the overall tone of the skin is more even and uniform as well as being more supple. No over the counter product will miraculously make fine lines and wrinkles vanish, no matter what promises are made.  But what it has already accomplished has made me wildly enthusiastic and I can easily recommend it. I bumped into a friend at an airport this week that I hadn&#x27;t seen in a few years and she seemed baffled, asking what my secret was to looking younger than before. So that was a much appreciated testament that I attribute to the exfoliation effects of this cream. Everyone&#x27;s skin and sensitivity is different so I would encourage the same gradual exposure as I patiently built on. At least one reviewer here expressed upset at actually being burned with this stronger concentration after being happy with the 5 % solution, emphasizing the need for caution and not being in too much of a hurry but appreciating that this is still acid and respecting it&#x27;s potential. I might add that I now apply it liberally and apply over it some oil, presently preferring Moringa Oil, and keep it on while I sleep. One perhaps obvious footnote, is that I make certain to wash my hands thoroughly after applying it to avoid touching or rubbing my eye in my sleep and the pain and irritation that would be certain to cause. I give it a very hearty recommendation, especially considering it&#x27;s comparatively modest price compared with some exorbitant designer creams or treatments at an esthetician.ly over it some oil, presently preferring Moringa Oil, and keep it on while I sleep.

    <li> I have normal to oily skin. Usually don&#x27;t break out if I keep black heads under control. This product gave me the worst breakout I&#x27;ve had in years. Made my skin oily and my pores felt clogged, even from spot treatments. A week or so after discontinuing use my skin started to clear back up. I would give this zero stars if I could. Glad it works for so many others though! :)</li>
    <li> Before I bought this, I thought- many of the reviews sounded like a cheesy infomercials. I&#x27;m not a skeptic by nature, but I am with too-good-to-be-true reviews. But this cream is TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE! I used one complete 1.5 oz container. It&#x27;s been roughly 3-4 months I have NOT used this product. And I can tell!!! I will reorder this week. When I use it, my already pale skin appears \\&quot;whiter.\\&quot; I read the ingredients several times to see if it had bleach! My face glows! I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, so the lines are creeping in. This really helps with the lines! I DID have a stinging sensation when I put it on. I found, for me, that happened when my skin was \\&quot;dry.\\&quot; Therefore, I applied it with a moisturizer, or mostly I put my moisturizer on after. The stinging stopped. The stinging also lessened after my skin grew accustomed to the product. I did NOT have a greasy affect, if anything, I worried it might dry my already dry skin. As stated, I applied my moisturizer after I applied this. I used this cream roughly 3-4 times a week. Some weeks more. I even used it during the day (if I had not used it the night before) if I needed the extra glow when I had a speaking engagement, etc. I gave it 5 Stars because I could not give it 10.</li>
    <li> After extensive !! research I purchased this for my wife he love it, her face skin looks a lot younger, all fine lines are gone.</li>
    <li> This resurfaces the skin and does all kinds of wonderful things for my acne, for scaring and for keeping my skin soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> After a few visits to the aesthetician, I believe that the stinging sensation when I put it on means it is working.  I have been alternating between is and the alpha lipoic acid and my skin does feel and look better.  I also love Reviva&#x27;s non.chemical peel which I use weekly.  Am I vain?  Maybe, but it is nice to have some affordable reliable products to try on my sun damaged aging skin!</li>
    <li> I even use it on my elbows and it really works there as well as my neck and face. My friends notice a glow.</li>
    <li> Cleared up my hyperpigmentation.</li>
    <li> I like this product and I&#x27;m definitely seeing some improvement in my skin texture. I&#x27;m someone with enlarged pores and problem skin, and so the change is wonderful. My only negative comment is that this cream is so heavy and oily. My skin starts feeling really gross after a few hours. If you&#x27;re someone with dry skin, this stuff will be perfect.</li>
    <li> Really amazing product, I use Retin A at night and this really helps with any flaking and makes my skin really smooth</li>
    <li> I like using this at night, along with moisturizer.  My friends sometimes ask me how I keep my skin looking nice, and this is part of it.  Sloughs off old dead cells and keeps my skin looking healthy. .</li>
    <li> Takes a while for your skin to adjust to the high percent of Glycolic Acid. But I must say there is definite improvement in my skin, awesome product.</li>
    <li> Only problem was that the item spilled during shipping due to the lack of a seal. But the item itself is so effective -- I can feel it! -- that I can&#x27;t help but give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I started off my putting this cream on my face and quickly found that I developed bumps and sprouted out random pimples when I usually never break out.  I then decided to only use it on my decollate and quickly developed bumps and acne there also.  This was not a coincident but a direct result of using this product.  Use with caution....</li>
    <li> I have used this before. Works great for cleanly removing moles, warts, and skin tags.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, makes my skin so soft and also reduced fine lines....not a lot, but even a little is nice.</li>
    <li> I like what it has done to my skin!</li>
    <li> The best thing I could use for my face!  I love this product! !</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this for it&#x27;s intended purpose, but it&#x27;s just fabulous for pimples of all kinds! My doctor told me it&#x27;s one of the only things safe during pregnancy so I used it then and continue to use it after. Gets rid of acne in a couple days and leaves your face and back soft without any dryness or irritation!</li>
    <li> After all the reviews i read I was expecting something... no difference in skin with or without. I will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I purchased  this skincare and I love it…it works just as I remembered when I worked as a beauty advisor years ago.</li>
    <li> My Husband had a seborrhea keratosis that he wanted to get removed.  While he was waiting for the approval to come through from his insurance, he bought this stuff and put it on the skin lesion.  About 2-3 weeks later he got the approval from the insurance; however, by this time the lesion was about gone and no dermatology appointment is needed.  There is smooth, healthy looking skin where the ugly lesion was located.  It also works on sunspots.</li>
    <li> Other than the stinging.. this product was great..it did its job and this stuff smells like lemons!! Make sure you follow the directions</li>
    <li> Work your way up to using every day.  Got into my neck wrinkles and caused a rug burn like thing but when it healed my neck looks amazing!  Now use it every morning and it has evened out my skin tone and wrinkles. Really happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because in the past few years I have started noticing areas of darker pigmentation/age spots on my face, particularly on my forehead near my hairline.  I didn&#x27;t start out with the 5% cream as is recommended and I&#x27;m glad that I didn&#x27;t.  I do feel a slight stinging sensation when I apply this cream but it goes away after a few minutes and is not painful, merely a bit annoying.  I am using this in combination with 4% Kojic Acid (from Cape Fear Naturals) which is a skin lightener.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is the glycolic acid, the kojic acid, or a combination of the two but I have seen marked improvement.  I have been using these 2 products for 3 weeks now and my age spots have diminished by at least half.  My skin also feels much smoother, brighter and just all around healthier.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my pores appear smaller as well.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the result and the cost is much less than having laser treatments or harsh chemical peels.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this product is doing anything for me. Have not seen any difference in the appearance of my skin and I have been using it over 2 months.</li>
    <li> The product does seem to make my face smoother...  However!... Every time I&#x27;ve used it (and I gave this thing about five or six tries) it would cause a break out of pimples on my face. I never get pimples, unless I use this cream. Not sure what is in here that could cause that. It did cause some peeling which is what I was looking for...  But it&#x27;s just not worth the bumps. One bump actually lasted for about a month. It would come to a head and I&#x27;d pop it and it would come right back. Never experienced anything like it before! Would not recommend..</li>
    <li> Item was exactly as described. Shipped quickly and arrived promptly. Great buy</li>
    <li> The best moisturizer out there for aging or acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> This cream works, and I have been using it for years. It is reasonably priced, especially when compared to name-brand cosmetics.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, because it really, really works.  Best price to be found anywhere.  j  Atlanta, Ga.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I had been using a similar 10% glycolic acid cream for YEARS that was twice the price of this product. I am SO glad I decided to switch. I have KP on my cheeks and this product does a great job of smoothing my skin and reducing redness.</li>
    <li> Used this for three months last fall after my face exploded from a three month contraceptive injection I begged my gyn for ( to save me from heavy periods for the summer). I literally had a serious problem on my hands, I just wanted to bury my head in the sand....slowly but surely it cleared up my skin and took away all the dark discoloration from each and every pimple, my scars are less deep and wrinkles are minimized. I don&#x27;t break out any more and I rarely get a period pimple, which was very common for me before I started using it. Now I only use it once a week if that.  Don&#x27;t be afraid by the stinging, its mild and if it gets to be too much then either start with the 5% or add lotion or night cream over it. Really good stuff.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, it only stings a few seconds where I may have popped a pimple.  It did not make me peel and I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is regenerating like I expected, my wrinkles are not disappearing, but maybe because I&#x27;m low 50&#x27;s and skin&#x27;s tougher.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer.  (I use more than my Kiehl&#x27;s.)  Light, not greasy.  I like so much, this is my second jar.</li>
    <li> Careful with this cream because this is the real deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a few other creams hoping for a true peel and they don&#x27;t compare to Reviva. There is a slight tingling (and a small burning) that is not super unpleasant if you are expecting it when you apply it and it definitely sloughs off the dead layers of skin. Warning though: don&#x27;t go overboard or use this more often than directed or your face will suffer.&lt;br /&gt;After just a few uses I noticed a more even skin tone, smoother skin around my mouth and chin, and many less freckles. After 6 months of regular use, my skin is noticeable tighter and I&#x27;ve had several people make comments on how I &amp;#34;must be doing something new to my skin&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me .  My face became very sore and dry after about a week of using this product. My face is in worst condition now than before I started using this product. I&#x27;m now working to get my skin back in condition. It might be right for some people, but maybe my skin is just to sensitive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks at night. It stings sometimes when it&#x27;s applied, so I assume it&#x27;s doing something to work on my wrinkles. But so far I haven&#x27;t seen any particular changes.</li>
    <li> Absolutely great stuff!  Works great for blackheads, enlarged pores, fine lines and wrinkles.  It lasts a long time too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have exceptionally high hopes for this product after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I have had dermatillomania for over ten years now and pick obsessively at my face and the rest of my body. I am truly hoping that in using this product my scars will begin to fade and will help me refrain from picking. I&#x27;ve used it three times now and love the way it makes my skin look, firm and lighter. But it&#x27;s only just the beginning. The true challenge is to not pick and have to begin all over again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as 10%. Seems more like 2%.</li>
    <li> Saved my skin but please please everyone, follow thw instructions.  Get used to the  5% first before using the 10%. Also,  it&#x27;s supposed to burn for a little. After all, you are putting acid on your face.</li>
    <li> This cream is a life saver! It combined with the Glycoloic toner has clearedy skin up almost completely! Will definitely be purchasing these products again!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product every other night. It slightly stings when it is first applied. I&#x27;m not sure if it has made a difference yet. I&#x27;m 31 years old and using this to slow down the aging process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted a star bc I don&#x27;t like that the container with the cream wasn&#x27;t sealed. The box wasn&#x27;t sealed either.</li>
    <li> Not the real deal.  I think this product is a fraud.  Not the strength it claims to be at all.  I have bought glycolic acid products in the past from my dermatologist, so I have what to compare it to.  Thought I would save a few dollars by buying online.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products to help my acne... maybe even all of them (including Accutane).  I had a dermatologist suggest glycolic acid toner, and that was helpful.  I decided to try the cream, too.  My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect and may never be, but this cream has definitely made a noticeable difference in the recurrence of acne problems.  I like that it isn&#x27;t prescription, too!  I use this with a Gly-Sal face wash and the aforementioned toner.  It&#x27;s a little intense, but I am happy with the results.</li>
    <li> It messed my face up. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a month I saw no difference and no improvement. then this morning I woke up with bumps all over my face. this stuff is horrible...</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product ..good price</li>
    <li> This cream made my face burn. Tried mixing it in with another cream but still felt a burning sensation. I am light skinned and have freckles. Maybe it is better for darker skin. I don&#x27;t usually have overly sensitive skin and can apply most products.</li>
    <li> I can feel the slight sting but I haven&#x27;t noticed ANY changes. I also thought that my skin might peel but it didn&#x27;t do that either. It might work for some but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I researched this cream for months before I purchased it. I have to do this now because as I age, my skin is more sensitive. MAN!!!! I am so glad my research paid off. This cream is light yet powerful. It smoothes your pores and fades brown marks (I&#x27;m a pimple popper picker). It&#x27;s the new addition to my &amp;#34;Age Gracefully&amp;#34; skin care regime.</li>
    <li> Really like the feel of the cream. I can feel a difference in my skin and also see a difference. It is a product I would use regularly.</li>
    <li> Product was missing inside seal and was partially used.  Gross.  They asked me to ship it back to them&lt;br /&gt;so beware you may get it next.  How hard is it to check the product before restocking it?  Obviously&lt;br /&gt;too hard.</li>
    <li> I originally tried this to see if it would help with a thickened area on my chin.  It did help to remove some of the thickening but the problem remains.  I have tried it over my whole face and it does not have any of the over-aggressive results some others described.  No drying or long term redness.  Just tingling and stinging for a little bit.  I found if I wiped my face with an acne wipe prior to using this cream, it prevented breakouts which initially happened with use.  My skin does look better overall.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic.</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t used this product before, start with the 5% cream &amp; use it every other night, then work up to nightly for a month or so, then move up to the 10%.  Trust me, you can go to any major beauty store, pay tons of money on stuff that movie stars endorse, but NOTHING compares to this.  PERIOD.    I got hooked on glycolic acid about 12 years ago, in my thirties, when I started getting adult onset acne.  This stuff really took care of it, and I have not used anything else since.  I have tried other acid products, including prescription ones, but nothing, absolutely nothing, compares to this product.  I not only use it on my face, but also my neck, throat and decolletage.  I go get facials about once a month at my dermatologist for sun damage (I live in Texas - not enough sunscreen in the world), and the technicians there are always amazed at how great my skin looks. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sell it in a gallon size!</li>
    <li> I had been using a 7% that was really not doing much any more so I wanted to bump it up a little.  So I did the patch test and had no problems, so I put it on the next night and wore it all night.  The next day and for the next week my face was so red and irritated.  It was like some sort of weird sun burn that didn&#x27;t peel, but got very dry... extremely dry.  So now I am wearing shea butter trying to moisturize.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time to write this review, I really wanted this product to work. I bought it based on all of the good reviews. Unfortunately, this cream is too thick for my for my skin. It clogged every pore on my face and made me break out with huge painful pimples on my cheeks and forehead, which is unusual for me. I brought this cream in august and had been using it up until last week (oct. 13), so I think I gave this product a good try and can confidently say that this stuff doesn&#x27;t work for me. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s working good for me but my mom has a sensitive face and she said this makes her face ruin but i&#x27;m satisfied</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this product! Initially, I bought it for my cleavage wrinkles. Its really the only place I have noticeable wrinkles. I have only used it twice, so time will tell if it helps my chest area&#x27;s appearance. But I&#x27;m using it on my face and neck as well. It definitely tingles for a bit after applying, nothing terrible. But in the morning, my skin feels so soft and smooth. I know I&#x27;ll be re-purchasing when I run low.</li>
    <li> Start off with the 5%, happy with results. Moved on to the 10% and hoping that I will see better results.</li>
    <li> I broke out therefore stop using and after second time.</li>
    <li> I am pretty hard core when it comes to acid peels and such. I had been using the Avon peel pads which supposedly has 35 percent glycolic acid. However those pads do not sting like this cream. I must say I am very happy and will continue to use this as part as my day cream. I used the skinceuticals 1.0 retinol at nit. Let me tell you my skin has NEVER looked this good!</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely sensitive. It&#x27;s as if I was carved out of rice paper and hives. I needed an exfoliator, Natalie Dee suggested some glycolic acid, so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it every other day after getting used to it, and it is simply too much for my delicate, easily angered skin. I broke out like a pubescent teen. So, I&#x27;ve switched to once a week, tops, and for now, my demon skin slumbers.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful, sensitive ladies and gents, this stuff is pretty powerful.</li>
    <li> I do like how this glycolic acid cream works, it leaves my face looking clear and so soft. I cleans my pores really well and it has helped to lighten my sun spot that I have had on the right side of my face for 20 years : )</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It is pretty strong, though.  Be careful at first.  I can only use it one or two times a week, and I need to keep it off my neck because it&#x27;s just too harsh for that delicate skin.  Also, it will eventually bleach out your eyebrows and the hair around your hairline.  Nonetheless, this cream keeps my skin looking fresh and is having good effects on the areas that have a few lines.  I used to get a glycolic acid peel every month, but that got expensive.  I think regular use of this cream is nearly as good.</li>
    <li> Used it several months hoping it will eventual work for me but after 1 year I gave up. Its not for everyone.</li>
    <li> I was searching around for anti-wrinkle products and I came across this one on Amazon so I read the reviews. I had hopes but I don&#x27;t always put a lot of stalk in reviews. Because the price wasn&#x27;t too bad and I&#x27;ve had luck in the past with glycolic acid, I decided to try it. I am stunned at how amazing my skin feels and looks after only one week! Last week I had two very deep lines between my eyebrows and I&#x27;m happy to report, they&#x27;re GONE! I can&#x27;t believe this stuff! I posted it on Facebook and now my friends are ordering it too! I hope they don&#x27;t run out because I will use this forever. If you&#x27;re sick of lines and wrinkles and dry skin, order it! You&#x27;ll be so glad you did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michelle</li>
    <li> I am 65 and have used this product for years. It has worked very well at reducing fine lines and eliminating brown spots.</li>
    <li> I had never used a glycolic acid cream before but I had been reading a lot how it is much better than a scrubbing exfoliation. The box said to try a lower glycolic (like 5%) so your face can get used to it, but I didn&#x27;t think about that. It didn&#x27;t matter though because my face took the 10% just fine! (I did test it on my forearm just to make sure, then on my neck) I use it every other night whenever I feel like my skin is getting a little dull. It says it&#x27;s for mature skin, but I am 21, oily/acne prone skin and wanted to get rid of acne/acne marks and this has totally helped!&lt;br /&gt;If it stings a little bit, you can add a light moisturizer over it once it is applied. It is for night use only.&lt;br /&gt;I have already recommended this to my friend who also is an acne sufferer. This isn&#x27;t just for acne marks either, it&#x27;s for aging skin as well! Great Product!</li>
    <li> a little strong for my likeing.  really dried up my skin and lines appeared more visable.  I will not re-purchase.</li>
    <li> Should by the 5% if your skin is not use to glycolic acid or is very sensitive. I use the 10% everyday, it has made my skin stronger, clearer, and smoother. Highly recommend for all ages and skin types. Word of warning use sparingly the first few weeks, it is suppose to hurt, but not be unbearable pain.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how well it works. I used it for a couple of weeks and it made me break out in to tumor kind of pimples so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to honestly rate this product. Nevertheless, so far, so good. Waiting patiently for a positive result.</li>
    <li> This is okay. I will not use it in the summer because of the increased photo sensitivity. I wore SPF 40 during the day while using this at night for 3 weeks and it caused parts of my chin to burn. I now have three distinct discolored marks that I am trying to fade with pure aloe. People with sensitive skin should use with extreme caution. The seller is great. No complaints on the seller and how quickly I received the product. The cream just did not suit me.</li>
    <li> i love the way this product made my face feel, but after the second use my face was irritated! I am going to use this product maybe once every other week to see if my face is more accepting of it. DIrections ask you to use a few times a week, and that was far too much for me.</li>
    <li> Although my package did not come to me on time i contacted the seller and the emailed me back right away. They apologized for the inconvienence and 2 days later they sent me a new one. I was completely surprised i though i was jipped. But no they did and awesome job at making sure i received my product. Reviva cream from Vitacost  is wonderful i defenitely recommed going through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream works wonders i have blemishs and acne scars and have breakouts here and there. Since i have been using the cream i have had no breakouts and acne scars are fading already after a week i love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Vitacost!</li>
    <li> So far so good!  I have been using it for 3 days.  My skin feels soft and my pores are smaller.  My only issue is the sunburn look for a bit after applying.  Not sure if it is the cleanser I am using or just that I started out with 10%.  I feel the true test will be in a month or so....</li>
    <li> Great use for my bad break outs. The 10% is strong on brown skin (POC) but it doesn&#x27;t peel too crazy to alter any pigment if used sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Can&#x27;t be without it.  I have been using for a few years now and nothing works as well to clear up my melasma.  Also use on rough, dry elbows and knees.  Makes them so soft.  Have even been using on my nails lately and they have become much stronger and my cuticles look great.  Best of all it helps prevent those pesky ingrown chin hairs!  Try it!</li>
    <li> works without drying out my skin - I don&#x27;t have to use it every night</li>
    <li> Works great. Strong stuff, but doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Don&#x27;t go out in the sun when using this without slathering on sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Just be careful. If you use too much on one area, it can legit burn your skin and make it inflammed for a couple of days. :/</li>
    <li> I am a 20 year old african american girl. Okay so I know this product is for acne, your pores or whatever, but I heard you can use this for razor bumps as well and I have razor bumps in my bikini area.. So I tried this applying it as directed before bed.. It didn&#x27;t sting at all the first time I used I applied it.. and I also applied it on my face. I have a very smooth face with like 1 or 2 small blemishes but it&#x27;s not big deal.. But I haven&#x27;t seen no changes.. I started applying this for three days every other day and now I use it everyday! If you apply this after you shave, girrrrrl your s*** is going to be burning!! Lol. Just make sure you apply a moisturizing cream afterwards.. Am I doing something wrong with applying this? I use black soap to shower and wait 30 minutes and then I apply the cream on the affected areas and have seen no changes.. Help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update April 24,2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so after my poor review in February, I started seeing results in March when I used it everyday for like a week. My face got brighter and I had a glow to me. I experienced no pimples by using this product. I stopped using it on my razor bumps because I got burned smh. I currently just had a MAJOR breakout using the Neutrogena Oil free acne wash the orange one. That face wash murdered my face!! I have normal skin but I had some pimples by my chin and used the face wash for like 5 days and my face broke out so bad smh. I&#x27;m starting to use this glycolic acid again so hopefully it will clear my face up. I never have pimples maybe just one or two so hopefully it works again!</li>
    <li> Was too strong for my skin.</li>
    <li> I had 3 big dark age spots on my face. I was told I would have to have a deep microdermabrasion to get rid of them. After only 10 days of using the cream almost every day those spots are much lighter. After the first 6 days of use they became quite red, and dry. I gave it a little break while the skin healed. After that they flaked away and my skin is smoother and cleaner. The spots are now pale pink. That is how it worked for me. Everybody&#x27;s skin is different so be careful. It is a potent cream. Start slowly. Do not put under eyes or any more delicate skin. Use a lot of moisturizer and sunscreen when out. Your skin will be more susceptible to burn when using the cream.</li>
    <li> Works great! However, do note it does take some time to see differences, it have been slowly repairing my acne damaged skin. It does tingle a bit when you put it on, and if you put to much on it will burn you (at least it burned me) I would listen to the instructions and not put this on more than 3 times a week. Other than that it is a great product!</li>
    <li> much better than more expensive glycolic products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this does anything for my skin, which is disappointing bcaz I was looking forward to some good results after all the great reviews I have read. I put it on at nights wake up to see my face very oily and it breaks me out abit....it&#x27;s a no go for me.</li>
    <li> Love it. i am 35 and i use it daily as my lotion.</li>
    <li> Actually, i dont write reviews, but in this case i can&#x27;t not to do this. I&#x27;ve never used any product of reviva labs and i first ordered this glycolic acid cream. Its first week i&#x27;m using it and i absolutely love it. Even the first day i looked in the mirror i saw the result - my skin looked smooth, clearer and relaxed. some people said that it irritates your skin, if you use 10% glycolic acid cream, without getting used to 5% cream, but it didn&#x27;t for me. I have oily skin and i think its the best night cream (i use it as a night cream 3 times a week)i&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months. I bought it particularly for a scar on my forehead I got from a curling iron. I applied it to the scar only every night, and noticed a difference is just a couple weeks. Within a couple months, my scar has practically disappeared. I am African-American, and my scars tend to be significantly darker than my regular skin tone, but now this particular scar has lightened very much and is much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used the cream on my entire face every now and although it gives my skin a better glow, I do not like that it leaves my skin dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, use only  A LITTLE of the cream. I once used too much to help fade a pimple scar, but it burned my skin and made the scar even worse. Ironically, I am still using the cream (sparingly) to help fade the burn it left me with.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin.....at 45.  I find it takes a combination of things to keep my skin on track, and this will be helpful.  It feels a little tingly when it first goes on, but then my skin gets nice and soft.</li>
    <li> A little drying some tingle but good mild exfoliating product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne scars for most of my life, and this is the only thing that&#x27;s actually helped visibly reduce the redness. Plus, after I use it, my skin feels soft and plush, like kittens paws instead of my usual haggard, dry-oily combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will sting when you first apply it. I didn&#x27;t believe it, but oh yeah... it&#x27;s akin in to when you get bleach on your hands after lightening your hair. Start with 3x a week and then move to every night once your skin gets used to it. I have VERY sensitive skin and I can&#x27;t handle a lot of chemicals, additives, fragrance, etc. Despite how &amp;#34;harsh&amp;#34; glycolic acid is, there&#x27;s nothing in this product that actually irritates your skin in a negative way. It has actually improved my overall skin texture and when I wake up in the morning after leaving this on overnight, my skin looks light and &amp;#34;glowy.&amp;#34; Prior to this, I&#x27;m not sure I would have ever used &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; to describe my skin upon wakeup. &amp;#34;Puffy&amp;#34;... &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;... &amp;#34;blotchy&amp;#34;... those were all terms I would have felt comfortable describing my face with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week to start seeing anything impressive, but even after the first night of secretly stealing a swipe of this cream from my roommate&#x27;s skincare hoard, I was impressed with how fabulous I looked, and thus went out and bought my own. (Before you judge me: she eats all my string cheese, so we&#x27;re even).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all the reviews beforehand, because I&#x27;m cheap and don&#x27;t like to buy a product that isn&#x27;t great and just sits on my shelf, glaring at me, wondering why I wasted money when I should have paid off more of my college loans. Most people warn you not to do something stupid and over-apply it, or get it in your eyes, etc. I agree. It&#x27;s acid; use it sparingly, use it cautiously, and you will most likely be fine. And this is coming from a girl whose skin breaks out every time I touch it. Literally: I can&#x27;t even use my phone without headphones, because if I touch the screen to my face I get a breakout the next day. I want to keep my skin encased in a glass jar to protect it from the world. Instead, I will just coat it in 10% acid every night and wake up looking like a star -- seriously.if I touch the screen to my face I get a breakout the next day.

    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it! With use every night, this has helped to reduce fine lines and age spots. her skin looks much healthier too! I have even used it a few times and it really makes a difference. Over the course of a couple days, it improves the look and texture of skin (wrinkles take a bit longer). It helped to reduce some of the hyperpigmentation I have and is great for use on sensitive skin. Also, a small amount goes a long way, so this jar can last for months. Just follow the directions and be diligent and it should work for you too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years, and have seriously tried everything. I was even having breakouts after Accutane. I read about glycolic acid, I decided to give it a try. After looking in to the reviews for the 5%, I decided to go straight with the 10%. I started with a small amount every other night followed by my regular moisturizer. Now I use it every night while still using my moisturizer after. No more breakouts! It&#x27;s amazing! I wish wish wish I had tried this sooner. I might actually recommend starting with the 5% because it definitely stings when you put it on, but other than that, I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this cream and as a very picky 30-year old woman with fairly sensitive skin, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Before using, I was finding dark spots, new acne breakouts and feeling my skin was dull and dragging me down.  I was so frustrated.  I&#x27;ve never had acne as teenager or in my 20&#x27;s so this was a surprise.  After looking at Proactiv&#x27;s reviews for their dark spot corrector, I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t work for me either and somehow ended up here - with a less expensive, more effective option.  I&#x27;ve used it every other night for the past 2 1/2 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m using less foundation in the morning and my spots are disappearing and acne has not surfaced since.  I&#x27;ve also read it helps with wrinkles....It wouldn&#x27;t suprise me. This cream is strong, so as others have recommended, use lightly and only every other night.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 1 week. I  imediately started using it. I had a break with big bumps from using a high dosage of biotin so after i stop using the biotin the bumps went away but left dark marks. I have never had acne or break outs so you know I freaked out. Researched some acid peels for the face and and came across this cream. the dark marks have lightened and there is some peeling in effect the new skin looks amazing. I can&#x27;t wait till the final results.</li>
    <li> I lived in Florida for 15 years. I spent most of that time outdoors. A lot of time pool side and on the bench. Needless too say it took a major toll on my skin. I had some major brown spots on my face that I thought would be there forever. I tried several different fade creams that promised amazing results. They didn&#x27;t remove anything but my money. I am so glad I decided to get this product a try. Trust me I was skeptical. Fast forward. The big brown spots are  gone along with almost all the little ones. I swear my wrinkles have decreased and my skin is brighter. Do yourself a favor give it a shot. I just bought another jar. I&#x27;m totally  pleased.</li>
    <li> This cream is great! I didn&#x27;t start off using their 5% so at first it was tingly and uncomfortable but that feeling went away after a few minutes and now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, it doesn&#x27;t feel that way at all. My skin is so much smoother and vibrant! It is a great and easy way to make your skin look amazing. It&#x27;s an easy addition to my beauty regimen. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Love this formula!  Great for rough elbows, knees, feet, etc.  Also good for once a month facial peel.</li>
    <li> I love it! It can sting a bit and dry your skin, bit that&#x27;s only until your skin gets used to it.</li>
    <li> Been using for a month and see a difference, not like I thought it would be but none the less a improvement...</li>
    <li> Love this cream!  Yes, it tingles when it&#x27;s first applied, but that will go away once the skin has adjusted.  My only advice is to be sure to blend it in thoroughly.  Will buy this product again!!</li>
    <li> i use this twice a week and it works just fine. it leaves a slight burning sensation for a minute or two, but afterwards it gets better. i initially used it with my moisturizer and then gradually moved to wearing it alone.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results from this product.  No drastic changes but has kept my skin smooth and wrinkle free.  I use it as part of my preventive maintenance regiment to keep wrinkles at bay.  Every night I start with a vitamin c and coq10 serum, the glycolic acid then Argan oil to moisturize.  No irritation if you moisturize properly and avoid direct sun exposure.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and use this about 2 times a week.  It works great, removed dead skin and has brightened up my face.  It is a higher concentration (10%) so I only use it twice a week otherwise you&#x27;ll get a little dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for someone with oily skin.</li>
    <li> At first the product seemed to work ok, but as others have said use extreme caution.  I have dark skin and my skin became hyperpigmented in some areas. There is an area that becane darker right beside my nose and under my eye and it&#x27;s not a small spot. Literally looks like how it looked from when I used my finger to swipe it on...there is an exact &amp;#34;swipe&amp;#34; dark area on my skin that I PRAY goes away. There&#x27;s also a dark spot near my left eye where maybe too much of the cream sat. I&#x27;m headed to the dermatologist instead if using AMAZON REVIEWS to make decisions for my skin.</li>
    <li> I use this often and so do my teenage boys. Works great for acne.</li>
    <li> Hooing this product works for me. But i love the smell and it does have a sting</li>
    <li> With continued use this cream has single handedly cleared my skin from freckles and blemishes. This cream is the bomb!!! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I use a glycolic cream along with my prescription Tretinoin. This stuff sometimes burns, but my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Let me first describe my skin: a lot of scars from acne and sun damage (used to be a sun worshiper), combination of oily/dry skin, large pores….all-in-all, bad news skin.&lt;br /&gt;I do take care of it now; I clean it every night- I don’t care how tired I am, I’m doing mini facials, I use Proactive on regular base so it balances PH of my skin and I use Olay moisturizer at night/ L’Oreal BB cream at day.&lt;br /&gt;I like mild glycolic acid; it does my skin the way that if feels new and refreshed. I used 30% glycolic acid for mini peels at home and I was very happy with the results. However, THIS cream is just fantastic. I put it on every night and my face is peeling especially on the places around my nose and at the corner of my mouth. It’s gentle and even though it stings a little I don’t mind- I know it’s working when it does. I already can see the results and I’ve been using it for only 2 weeks. I cannot wait to see my skin in a month. The pores on my face are visibly smaller and blemishes are lighter. I had a huge patch of sun damage on my forehead; it’s almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;I’m getting ready to order 2 more jars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for almost 2 months.  After about a week or 2 of using it, I noticed a dramatic difference in my pore size.  Before, when I looked in the mirror, you could see huge pores all along my nose and cheek area- this is GONE now which is a great thing.. I have also noticed a more even skin tone after these 2 months of use.  The not so great thing is I have been breaking out (below my nose to my chin and jaw) like I have never broke out before.  I&#x27;m not sure if it is from this product or stress/hormones etc in my life.  Some people say it is the cream &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; and drawing out all the crap from my skin and others say it would be causing it.. ahhh.  I have changed nothing else in my life (same shampoo, conditioner, face wash, diet, etc)  I also noticed I got a lot of &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; pimples that came and went in a matter of a day instead of hanging around for a week like usual-- I never had little quick acne before so again, not sure what is happening.  For those wondering, I&#x27;m a woman in my early 30&#x27;s with acne since I was 13 (when does it STOP?!)  Recently started getting cystic acne too. blah.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will continue to use on my nose up to my forehead since that is working for me.  I will try to deal with the lower half of my face with other stuff I guess.</li>
    <li> I had dry rough knees which would not improve with scrubs, so I tried this and nothing happened for 4-5 days, suddenly, started peeling all over my knee, i let it peel (with moisturizer to ease the burning sensation). After the peeling period is over (3-4 days after), it left my knee black, i mean, black, like, I burned it so bad. I thought it would go away, but no, it was there, and it had been there for months. I was SO devasted. NOw, i&#x27;ve been applying Hydroquinone and Retinol 2.5% for months and months, and is bit better. But when i wear skirt above knee, i get comments from my friends like &amp;#34;what happend to your knee?&amp;#34; &amp;#34;did you bruise your knee?&amp;#34; I am so sad, i would DEF not use it if i could go back in time :(</li>
    <li> This got rid of my sons &amp;#34;backacne&amp;#34; in a week with no scarring.  I used it to get rid of an age spot on my nose and it worked wonderfully.  I highly suggest this product for many uses.</li>
    <li> I dont think this is good for people who have sensitive skin, i had a bad reaction with this, it burned the upper layers of my skin and turned it reddish brown, similar to a sun burn, and now it is scared i went to doctor i have to put steroids and use hydroquinone, i used spf 50 and wore long sleeve protective clothing but still it burned, thankfully i only used it on my arm and back not my face otherwise god help me i would be crying. i dont think this is for everyone it is not safe to put an alpha hydroxy on your skin without consulting with a physician to examine your skin first.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a bit of a sting when you put it on. I actually use the almost daily with other moisturizers. Quantity per use is less than the size of a pea. It goes a lonnnng way!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working, but my skin is sensitive to it.  I am a redhead, so sensitive any ways.  Good</li>
    <li> My pimple were almost gone in one usage. My pores had greatly reduced in just 1 week and got a glow since then. Will continue to use thus product.</li>
    <li> This really is a great product.  It is beginning to help my skin, and I can feel it working.  I am anxiously awaiting the results after continuous use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2months and results are amazing.  I absolutely love it.  When I first started using it, it burned my face and my face broke out.  That is because it says to use 3 times a week.  I was also using my vitamin c homemade serum and the reaction was horrible.  If you use this cream, dont exfoliate your face with scrubs or any kind of vitamin c serum. They don&#x27;t mix well and you will have worst skin than what you started off with. After a few tries I finally got it down to a science because I have extra super sensitive skin.  I started off using it twice a week every other day.  Inbetween the days I was using the glycolic cream, I didnt use my facial scrubs or vitamin c serum, I just washed my face and washed my face gently.  The results were amazing.  It took atleast 5years off my face no joke.  The deep indentations you get by your nose because of the aging process is now gone and my face looks all plumped up.  I still use my vitamin c serum and face scrub but I give my face a few days rest after I have used the glycolic acid.  It takes away the fine lines under your eyes aswell.  I have now increased it to 3 times a week, but ONLY every other day. Your face really has to adjust to it, especially if you have never used glycolic acid before or have sensitive skin.  Remember NO EXFOLIATING during use of this product because it is an exfoliator all by itself.  This is now  a life long product and will continue to purchase because my skin is absolutely beautiful now.  Even as a teenager my skin wasnt this smooth and clear.  I highly recomend this.</li>
    <li> I like it I can see the difference in my skin and the wrinkles are improving. Yes I would recommend it .</li>
    <li> I have been searching for some kind of product to help fade stretch marks on my belly, and somewhere I heard glycolic acid helps. Knowing this cream is for use on the face, I bought it anyway. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but already the redness in my scars has faded a few shades. Also, my skin seems to be a little more tightened than before. I use it twice a day, letting it soak into my skin before getting dressed. There&#x27;s virtually no smell, and it&#x27;s very thick, so a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m going to stick with this product.</li>
    <li> I Love this product,  I believe in glycolic for the skin so am&lt;br /&gt;very glad I found it. Excellent cream</li>
    <li> This stuff is truly working.  I will buy it again.  I can see the skin peeling and hoping that longer term, I will see fresher skin as this is the idea for acid burn.</li>
    <li> I am a little confused by other reviews about using this as a chemical peel. It states on the directions to use less frequently if you notice peeling so I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it being used in that manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it just like I would a moisturizer. I have been using glycolic acid for about 7 or 8 months now. I was recommended this as a treatment for hormonal breakouts (which I didn&#x27;t start getting until my late 20s) and it has really helped when nothing else did. I started with 5% and then went up to 10% when that jar was finished. I do get some stinging when I apply it just after washing, especially if I have any signs of a breakout. If I wait just 10 or 15 minutes after washing to apply it, there is no stinging. But I prefer the bit of stinging; feels more effective. I like to bump up my use to twice a day if I am having a problem with a breakout. I have had no issues with peeling or sunburn or anything like that and I am very fair skinned with sensitive skin. I limit sun exposure but only wear sunblock when I know I will be in the sun for a prolonged time because sunblock will also cause me to breakout. I do not use any other creams or moisturizers on my face. I feel this product provides enough moisture on it&#x27;s own. My last jar of this lasted me about 5 months so that shows how little you need to use and what a good value this is. I haven&#x27;t really noticed if it has reduced wrinkles or evened my skin tone at all. I didn&#x27;t purchase it for that reason so if it has, that is just a bonus.</li>
    <li> Great for daily use and seller is recommended as well.  Helps keep skin healthy and clear.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. My acne and wrinkles are clearing up.</li>
    <li> I used the reviva 5% cream prior to this one for the problem area on the back of my arms. I was happy with how smooth my skin felt and the gradual lightening of the hyperpigmentation from clogged pores, pimples, whatever that was on the back of my arms. The 10% cream is helping to clear the issue up even faster and of course I appreciate the natural ingredients incorporated into the product. I plan to continue to use this until the back of my arms are no longer a &amp;#34;problem area&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This product really does a good job</li>
    <li> I use this every night before I go to bed. I see my skin looking visibly better. Finer lines, smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;A general word of caution. For those of you trying glycolics for the first time, you might experience stinging and itching. Have a cup of water with a tablespoon of Baking soda dissolved in it to wash off the glycolics and neutralize the acid (alkaline balances acid). Don&#x27;t use this every night at first. try it once every few nights until your skin gets used to it. you can also try it for a short while then wash it off, extending the time it is on. I leave it on over night. This is a product I will continue to use until they come up with something better..</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t come in a fancy jar from a fancy department store, but it gives me fancy results. I have sensitive, oily skin, so it&#x27;s very difficult for me to find a product that doesn&#x27;t either cause breakouts and excessive oil or the exact opposite - overdrying. This is one of the only products that leaves my skin feeling really soft and dewy, without looking or feeling like an oil slick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 yes old and I have used this nighty for a week now and I love it. I can allready see a difference in my complexion. I plan to start using it morning also beginning this week.</li>
    <li> I really do not feel anything after using it the first few days...seems to have lost it&#x27;s punch, but will wait and see.</li>
    <li> This product is great for individuals who scar easily. I use it on my chest and within just a couple of weeks it completely eliminates acne scars. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve found on the market for eliminating dark spots</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Very good for your skin.  Will take off years.  Really great product.  thanks.  xxxxx  xxxx  xx</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too big on leaving reviews, but I owe this product one. I&#x27;m 35 and just started noticing slight wrinkles on my forehead, around the eyes and between my eyebrows. After doing some research, I figured I give this product a shot, especially since it&#x27;s so inexpensive and seems to have great reviews. I got my jar on Friday, and even though the instructions say only used it 3 times per week if you&#x27;re not used to using glycolid acid, I used it on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. I should have listened to the direction... today, I woke up with a little redness on my face, but nothing major. I applied some powder and you can&#x27;t even tell. I also noticed a little peeling on my forehead, but if you&#x27;re not looking very close, you can&#x27;t tell. My fault, I should know how to follow directions by now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this so you&#x27;ll be smarter and do as you&#x27;re told on the packaging. After 3 days of use, my little wrinkles are GONE. My skin is soft, and looks like it did in my early twenties. The deeper ones are still there, but I&#x27;m sure once I start using the cream as I&#x27;m supposed to, those will fade too. I&#x27;m so happy that I got this cream. I&#x27;m thinking about stocking up. It does burn a little when you apply, but it&#x27;s not unbearable and once you put a little regular moisturizer on top, the burning subsides. I&#x27;m a rookie on the anti-aging beauty market, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase, and especially at this price.</li>
    <li> Love this!! I have extremely oily skin and hormonal acne, thus helps a lot!!!! I will def purchase again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I think this is great for exfoliating mature skin. It&#x27;s light acid two or three times a week keeps my facial skin smooth and supple. Eliminated a few wrinkles too! I&#x27;ll never be without it.</li>
    <li> use sparingly at first. the sting is worth getting over. this is good stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. I use it everyday  it softens my face and helps keep wrinkles away. This is the best price and fast, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I used the 5% first and noticed improvement with my skin.  I decided to jump to the 10%, I thought it would be harsh not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I  image if I didn&#x27;t use the 5%, I might have had a different result.  I use this product morning and night. My suggestion start off slow.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the reviews.  I will purchase again.  I think it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Be Blessed!&lt;br /&gt;Sharon</li>
    <li> Amazing! The cream really works! It&#x27;s strong too!</li>
    <li> Love this acid cream!  I use it a couple times a week and can tell my face looks better after using it.  I suffer from melasma and while it doesn&#x27;t get rid of it, it does help to fade it and keep it under control.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and item was as described.</li>
    <li> I have spent a ton of money on scrubs, soaps, and oils hoping to see some scar lightening and nothing happened. This actually helped with my acne scars when nothing else did. My scars are lighter, not gone, but definetly lighter. If you are looking for acne scar relief, try this before any other product.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to start with the 5% you can use this gradually. This cream works and it&#x27;s unscented!</li>
    <li> Excellent product !!! works on my skin</li>
    <li> This is my first review ever!  I order alot from Amazon but, I have never left a review.&lt;br /&gt;This REVIVA 10% Glycolic Acid Night Cream is awesome!  It does tingle a little bit at first but, then that goes away.  Using as directed, 3 nights a week.  I see a vast improvement in my skin from just under 1 week.  Skin feels and looks tighter and appearance of lines around my eyes are much improved!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL keep purchasing this! BTW... I&#x27;m 42 yrs old.&lt;br /&gt;* I always find it more informative when I have an idea of the age of the person leaving the review. :)&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Good cream to get rid of blemishes on face. I used this on my face,chest, and back of neck. It did sting a lot because my skin was not used to the 10% glycolic acid in it, but my skin has gotten a lot better ever since using this. I used this on my chest a couple days in a row because i had some acne there and noticed some peeling on my skin after using, so i skipped a few days and just moisturized and it has gotten much better. Acne has decrease and much less noticeable. I also use my clarisonic mia, which helps my creams go on smoother and work more efficiently on my skin. I ordered a larger size from a different company to use for other parts of my body to see if it makes a difference with skin exfoliation. Hopefully it helps!</li>
    <li> I have used it once a week.  I can tell a slight difference.</li>
    <li> I have read many negative reviews about this cream. I used the 5% glycolic cream for years and love it but decided to up it to 10% since my mother uses the 10% and loves it. I was a little afraid that it would be too harsh and at first it did dry out and seem to almost burn my skin for about a week but I exfoliated and now my skin is glowing and fresh. I think it takes a while for your skin to get used to a new product and keep in mind that each person has a different skin type so what is good for one person may not be for another.  My suggestion is that if you have normal to oily skin with wrinkles that isn&#x27;t extremely sensitive to products, try the 5% glycolic cream first and if that is okay for you, bump it up to the 10%.  I only use this once a day (at night).  I think twice a day would be way too much.  I use Reviva&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid Serum during the day under my makeup. It is a great day serum.  I get compliments on my skin all the time for my age (50).  You can&#x27;t beat the price for Reviva&#x27;s products.  Their ingredients are competitive to high end department store products without the price tag.  Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for about a week, and I can definitely see the difference it is making on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream solely on what the reviews said about it.  I never used a peel before and I wanted to ease myself into that regimen.  This cream does the trick. I use it 3 nights a week as directed and honestly my pores have shrunk so much that I&#x27;m still amazed by it.  I have minimal skin peeling but I do see a pink glow surfacing.  If you have never used a peel before and you have mature skin, I think this cream will do the trick.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and very minimal stinging or burning sensation.</li>
    <li> Started using this cream after trying a lower concentration glycolic acid with good results.  I am almost 42 and had difficulty with adult acne, as well as normal aging related complaints.  Since using the Reviva cream I have had only a couple of isolated pimples and usually have no breakouts at all.  My acne is completely gone and if I do get an occasional pimple, it is much less deep and noticeable.  I also notice a big difference in smoothness and overall complexion.  My skin looks so much better that my father started asking me what I was using on my skin since it looked so good.  I now have my parents using the cream and my mom has noticed a huge difference in the age spots on her hands and face.  My husband has also commented that my face looks amazing since starting the cream nightly.  On top of the results, the cost is amazing and so affordable - can&#x27;t understand why people would buy anything else!</li>
    <li> I received an unsealed jar in a damaged box. A big glop had been &amp;#34;sampled&amp;#34; from the jar, to top it off.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Put it on my face every night and it keeps my skin beautiful.</li>
    <li> I am a 27 year old Asian female with oily, huge pores, and uneven skin tone. I would get one or two pimples once a month due to my cycle. I was skeptical with using this product but I am now glad I did! I have been using this product for a month now. I used it every other night and I used aloe Vera gel in the morning. So far, my skin is soft, smooth and appears to be brighter. My brown pimple scars seems to be fading and my pores are getting smaller. You will feel a slight sting for one minute and it will go away. I will continue to buy this product and recommend it to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking I would never get rid of my new break out of razor bumps, but never use it. I just exfoliated my skin in a good two weeks the bumps were gone.  It took two days to be ship to me, that was cool.</li>
    <li> I read all the positive reviews and was really excited about the product.  I used it for approx 4 weeks and can&#x27;t tell a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> After reading all of the encouraging reviews, I bought this.  I use it everyday on my chest and back of hands.  The difference it&#x27;s made to the texture of my skin is wonderful.  I use it on my face and neck once a week, it&#x27;s strong - which is good.  It works!  Great purchase!</li>
    <li> No noticeable change after 2+ weeks.</li>
    <li> I tried this after getting some other 10% glycolic acid cream from my dermatologist. I wanted the same stuff but without parabens. I&#x27;m so happy I found this. I think it might be a tad stronger than the one I got from my doctor (maybe that one was weak I think). I could see a difference in pore size within two days. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I use this cream every night.  I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels really smooth, it seems to work just as advertised. No redness or irritation, have only used it for a week now. I&#x27;m sure long term benefits are terrific.</li>
    <li> I guess I missed the part where it said to &#x27;this is for skin that has been conditioned to our 5% glycolic cream.&#x27;  I had been using a different glycolic product before this so when I had a choice between the 5% and 10% I figured what the heck, better results, right? Well, probably yes but man does it sting/itch after I put it on. It&#x27;s like walking into the ocean after you&#x27;ve just shaved your legs or a bunch of little red ants biting your face and neck. I have decided to stick with it (rather than buy the 5% and use that first) because I&#x27;m getting great results and beauty is pain, right?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it every other night (per directions for starting) for a few weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed brighter skin, a more youthful glow, and a couple of dark spots from old blemishes have lightened up.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit heavy and when I wake my face seems oily but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. It has just a few ingredients and its none of that impossible to pronounce crap. The scent is on the mild side and its not great but not bad either. I think I&#x27;ve found a new keeper!</li>
    <li> This cream is the best product I&#x27;ve used for my skin. Yes, it stings when first applied, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s worse when you apply too much. You get the same results whether you apply just enough to cover the surface area of your face, or if you glob it on - the latter being the more painful method. Regardless, the 5 minutes of stinging is worth the beautiful results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experienced a severe case of adult acne in the end of 2013 - cleared up earlier this year and just working on the post-acne marks and texture at this point. This cream does the job! My skin gets more and more clear and smooth every day. I still get minor breakouts around that time of the month, but this DEFINITELY helps control them.&lt;br /&gt;I did not start with the 5%. My skin has been through a lot and can handle high concentrations so I just eased into the 10% by using every other day for a week or so at first. Now I use nightly.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that when you combine it with other treatments, like a peel or facial, it can be too much and your skin will get a little dry. Just take a break for a day or two and use some extra moisturizer and you will be OK.&lt;br /&gt;At night I wash with Dr. Ohhira&#x27;s Probiotic Kampuku Beauty Bar and then use this.  You must use an SPF with this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping</li>
    <li> i should&#x27;ve bought the 5% because if I don&#x27;t Dilute it with water, it&#x27;ll sting pretty bad. But, either way, it makes my skin so fresh looking. It&#x27;ll be red after application for about fifteen minutes but after that it makes your skin baby smooth and really clean looking. if this is your first experience with glycolic acid, I suggest you get the 5% in this brand first.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price tag or the hideous packaging influence your opinion of this product, if you need something that will help with skin cell turnover. This stuff WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin. I don&#x27;t use this product every day because putting 10% glycolic acid makes skin too sensitive to sun damage. But when I get a blemish, or my skin just looks dry and flakey, I use this product and it is like magic. It will tingle, sometimes burn. But only for a few minutes. (Those with sensitive skin should definitely avoid this product)</li>
    <li> At first I used this product on areas that needed exfoliation like dark marks, blemishes etc. I noticed the skin peeling after a week or so, and not to be gross but through the translucent skin you could actually see the darker pigment and a new fresh skin underneath. I sort of liked the idea of shedding my skin like a snake, so I used in on my entire face. I broke out in the worse acne I&#x27;ve ever seen. I have pretty good skin, but I blame myself on this one because it doesn&#x27;t actually say it&#x27;s for the face in the first place. Besides my face looking much uglier than the 3 or 4 dark spots I was treating initially, it&#x27;s a good product but only use it on your body, not your face. Oh, it stings like a bee bite, or like fire ants, that is just because it&#x27;s eating at your skin so it will fall off. As crazy as it may seem, I will repurchase, i&#x27;ll just be more careful on how I use it. Not gentle on sensitive skin, maybe start with 5%</li>
    <li> works great! i love this product! i am a 21 yr old with some little scarring of pimples and it has been dissappearing with the night cream. my skin is also smoother and more clear. love this.</li>
    <li> I &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; off a couple of sun spots I had on my face with this stuff. Nothing but smooth skin left. Some of my friends and my ex wife noticed it right away. If you put it on too thick it will burn quite a bit.</li>
    <li> 47 year old skin with lines and occasional breakouts.  This product has made my skin smoother looking and pores appear smaller.  Started with 5% to test sensitivity.  No problems.</li>
    <li> I jumped right in and started w/the 10 %. Since I have been derma rolling for over a year I knew my skin could take.&lt;br /&gt;Your Awesome reviews gave me the courage to use this product, a Huge Merci to you all!!&lt;br /&gt;From the very start I could see a big dif in the texture of my skin and have continued to use it twice a day, AM &amp; PM every other day while derma rolling 1.5 on the days in between.&lt;br /&gt;This regime, along with various DIY serums has transformed my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;At this point I have also upgraded to a stronger 50% Glycolic Acid that I use several times a week with amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;Love Amazon &amp; all my rejuvenating Sistas!!  Namaste,  Zoe</li>
    <li> Pretty sure it caused my face to breakout so I stopped using it.  I do not recommend. It is Very cheap.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t start with the 5% Glycolic Acid Cream (as recommended) and haven&#x27;t really had any problems. Every so often I have some mild stinging (after shaving) but nothing to complain about. It&#x27;s not something I would use everyday because I don&#x27;t want to over dry my skin. I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the redness that some of the other customers have complained about. I primarily use it to help with ingrown hairs (from shaving my head and face)-- it seems to help but I&#x27;ve only had the product for a couple of weeks. Shipping was fast and the product arrived as promised. Would by from Reviva Labs again.</li>
    <li> OK, this is an excellent product for skin turnover. I would suggest using intermittently to see how your skin responds.  I used it the recommended way every other night and experienced some mild peeling. I would recommend using Cetaphil lotion to help with peeling skin. I would imagine that diluting it slightly with your normal night cream would be helpful if you find it makes your skin red.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several brands of glycolic acid cream and this one is comparable.  Works very well for me.  It helps clear up any breakouts and smooths out and seems to renew my skin.  If you have never used a glycolic acid cream before, you just need to be aware that it can tingle for a couple of minutes if you have any cuts or other open spots on your face.  But I highly recommend it as part of your regular nightly skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin please don&#x27;t try this product it was so painful and don&#x27;t order from this seller</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy if you have sensitive skin! my skin isn&#x27;t even that sensitive, and after two days of using this product, it burnt ALL of my skin off where I applied it! (chest)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews suggesting the 5% before this product but my skin is tough and knowing that I purchase the 10% cream. My skin didn&#x27;t sting or turn red. I purchased a week ago and I have used every night and the last three days I added to my morning routine using before my moistuizer. I can&#x27;t wait to see my skin in the next month because as of today my skin appears more even and looks softer in apperance. I am 35 with combo type skin. I will buy again in a heartbeat. I also like the fact the ingrediant list isn&#x27;t a mile long!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product when I was pregnant to take the place of my benzoyl peroxide products (I was told glycolic was ok during pregnancy).  My skin, which has always been acne prone and oily, was breaking out horribly.  I was of course hoping that this product would solve the problem, but all I can say is I guess it kept it from getting worse.  If I didn&#x27;t use it for a couple of days I noticed even more break outs, so I know it was doing something.  I had used glycolic products in the past, so I didn&#x27;t find the 10% too extreme; I would definitely not start with 10% though.  And on the parts of my face that weren&#x27;t broken out, I did notice smoother skin after using the product.</li>
    <li> Takes away the dullness on my forehead. Doesn&#x27;t do much for blackheads and acne, so far. But, jeez. I don&#x27;t even need make up anymore! If dullness is your problem (and maybe some fine wrinkles) try this. My skin can handle ben. peroxide and all those intense creams fairly well....with some dryness if I use it too often. This is intense, but I don&#x27;t get the irritation. I would go ahead and just get the 10% if you&#x27;ve tried benz peroxide and it doesn&#x27;t burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to get results you would from a peel. This is as good as it gets for at-home treatment, with very comparable results. They also sell it at ulta for a bit more money.</li>
    <li> Great cream that has amazing results.  Helps to rebuild collagen.  I love this stuff!  It lasts a long time because you only need a tiny amount.</li>
    <li> very good product at a very good price</li>
    <li> lasted longer than i expected. worked fine. my skin is tough tho so it wasn&#x27;t as effective as i thought</li>
    <li> I had been using Dr. Denese products with great results but wanted to shift to a natural product, so I bought my 1st jar of Reviva Labs 10% about two years ago. * * * LOVE IT. * * * HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. * * *  Takes a little longer than the Dr. D products to produce visible results, but that&#x27;s OK by me, given that Reviva omits the scary chemicals she uses. ....... One way I know it&#x27;s working: When I stop using it for even two days (bc I&#x27;ve misplaced it or run out), my skin turns flaky and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does:&lt;br /&gt; * Gently exfoliates dead skin (which in turn gets rid of blackheads and then prevents them, and also prevents period blemishes, which I was still getting at 49, before glycolic acid);&lt;br /&gt; * prevents fine lines (I&#x27;m 53 and while I have some deeper lines in my forehead and from corners of mouth toward chin, I have virtually no fine lines);&lt;br /&gt; * shrinks pores (or gives the illusion of having shurnk them); and&lt;br /&gt; * keeps my skin looking healthy and bright (not pink or reddish, but just healthy -- not dull or greyish, as was the case).&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether it has firmed my skin, but even if it hasn&#x27;t, I&#x27;m not complaining -- I don&#x27;t expect the world from a $15 jar of face cream. (That said, it far outperforms my initial expectations.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning: If you&#x27;re not used to glycolic acid, START WITH THE 5% -- the 10% will be too much for your skin. And, even as an experienced user, I find that it stings a little when I resume after a few days off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, if useful: I&#x27;m white, with fair-ish skin that burns a little then tans a little (not redhead-type fair skin); my skin isn&#x27;t thin (don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s medium or thick), and my skin is sometimes sensitive (I get hives easily) but I&#x27;ve had no problems with this product.</li>
    <li> Powerful product. Don&#x27;t use daily or use a lot in any one application. You will hurt. Does eat away fine lines, discolored and/or aging skin. Sure beats going to a salon paying big bucks for the same results.</li>
    <li> Iread alot of reviews about this before I bought this and all the good things are true. I lile how it helps to bring your fresh skin forward. I would make sure your skin is accustomed to the 5% because I went straight to ten percent and I did have that a &amp;#34;sunburn&amp;#34; feeling. The only thing is when leaving over night it left my face super oily and I already have oily skin. Over all this product does what its supposed to and  really does keep your skin from looking dull .</li>
    <li> This product will make your skin look younger! I use it every night and wake up to a better looking face every morning.</li>
    <li> Love for use on my shoulders. Does not sting and is helping with acne and scarring.</li>
    <li> Seems to working beautifully at an inexpensive price</li>
    <li> I watched a show on tv one day while home on vacation, the young lady was giving Beauty advice. I&#x27;m 48 and have always taken care of my self and my skin, however I am not one that believes that you have to spend a lot of money to get a good produce. This is one of those effective produces that it accessible and affordable for everyone. The best news is that it works, after using it for 2 weeks as directed on jar I had people began to complement me on the glow of my skin.  I use it on my neck and chest also. :)</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I purchase it on a reqular basis. It is one of the best creams for the skil I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Christine</li>
    <li> I have been dealing with acne for the past two years now. I finally found what works for me. My skin isn&#x27;t perfect now but my acne is minimal and so I don&#x27;t wear any make-up. This is my night routine: I first use Cetaphil to wash my face, I then apply 10% benzoyl peroxide on my acne spots/bumps. I let it dry for about 20 minutes and I then apply a thin layer of Glycolic Acid. I have realized the benzoyl peroxide just by itself doesn&#x27;t do much, but when coupled with Glycolic Acid, it does wonders to my skin. I am so happy with this product. It&#x27;s honestly a miracle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have been very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I have purchased many many products and this one is the ONLY product that my 41 yr old skin has responded to. I am a redhead with fair freckily skin and adult acne.&lt;br /&gt;Well.... I use to have acne. Not anymore!!!! Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is to put it on morning and night. And I am telling you I have not seen better results EVER!&lt;br /&gt;My freckles are fading, and my skin is smoother than it has been in YEARS!!!! Also my once HUGE pours are also decreasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and will use it for as long as they make it.&lt;br /&gt;I already have another extra bottle on hand- am considering getting a couple more- lol!!!</li>
    <li> it burnt my skin even using a sparce amount</li>
    <li> So far this product is great. My skin feels smooth after i use it.</li>
</ol>
