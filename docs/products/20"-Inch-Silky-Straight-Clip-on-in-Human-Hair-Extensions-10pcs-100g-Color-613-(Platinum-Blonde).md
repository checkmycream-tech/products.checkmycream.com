      <li>The color matched my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>When i wear them curly they blend in perfectly though.</li>

      <li>It was the perfect color!</li>
      <li>great price for great hair!!</li>
      <li>These extensions are very lovely!</li>
      <li>Anyway all in all great for price</li>
      <li>Also, great customer service (;</li>
      <li>but i found these clips are way better than the headkandy ones!!</li>
      <li>So I gave them to a co-worker who dyed them brown and they matched her hair fairly well</li>
      <li>They are good quality</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t recommend wearing it in humid weather because the extensions stick to your neck if you do and keep a comb or something with you incase of tangling good product for the price over all</li>
      <li>The extensions paddle brush I own which is amazing even pulled the hair out of the strands!</li>
      <li>They came very fast and I was impressed.</li>
      <li>love these extensions!</li>
      <li>so they blended in nicely in that way.</li>
      <li>so I might use them under mine to make a nice contrast.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair and one set was perfect, so I am happy with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color matches my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>These are awesome extensions, very long and beautiful.</li>
      <li>they came to me fast  was satisfied with the color it matches perfectly with my hair</li>
      <li>I am a licensed cosmetologist and purchased for my 20 year old daughter with great experience with hair extensions!</li>
      <li>They were delivered to me very quickly!</li>
      <li>These are okay extentions</li>
      <li>They dont look 20 inches either more like 15</li>
      <li>I would have to cut them to make them look better</li>
      <li>Price was fair but these were not convenient or worth my money to buy again.</li>
      <li>and the 70g that you buy from SALLYS are better then these 100g.</li>
      <li>would tell people with thicker hair that if you want them, buy more than one set.</li>
      <li>You need to use more strength opening and closing the clips than you should.</li>
      <li>really hope im not dissapointed!!!!</li>
      <li>They are very very long and they stay in your hair all day :D</li>
      <li>It was clean!</li>
      <li>These are very good quality HUMAN hair extensions for $50!!</li>
      <li>i feel as if i can easily torn the hair away.</li>
      <li>They are real human hair and are sold at a great price.</li>
      <li>.. guess what.. for the same price you can go to foxylockshairextensions.com and get a beautiful set of hair worth your money.</li>
      <li>I could of went to a real beauty supply and got better quality</li>
      <li>I love them and get complements about my thick beautiful hair every time I wear them.</li>
      <li>so I needed something quick...</li>
      <li>but these fit/blend super well in my hair and</li>
      <li>Beautiful soft human hair.</li>
      <li>but if you on need a little hair they would be great...</li>
      <li>extensions are about as professional as buying hair wefts and doing it yourself, but I think you could do better.</li>
      <li>I would definitely purchase from seller again, was a very good price I would have paid double the amount if I bought in a store where I live.</li>
      <li>My first extensions i had before these were from headkandy.com and 22\\</li>
      <li>But these tangled to fast!</li>
      <li>but the hair is gross, the clips are CHEAP!</li>
      <li>The only adjustment I made to these is that I added more clips in between the ones already on the wefts.</li>
      <li>And after waiting about two weeks for them to get here I was very excited only to see the color didn&#x27;t match.</li>
      <li>the last pair I bought on amazon were from a different dealer and they we super nice..</li>
      <li>If your hair is as long as the extensions, they may be good to add extra volume.</li>
      <li>I really like these extensions.</li>
      <li>they arrive tomorrow hoping for a light blonde.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very bummed out.</li>
      <li>I have wanted to try clip in extensions for awhile and didnt think they were very affordable until I saw these.</li>
      <li>The clips are really cheesey too.</li>
      <li>They matched my hair so well and added so much volume.</li>
      <li>I really like them.</li>
      <li>Barely legal to say 20&amp;#34</li>
      <li>but im deffintly buying another pair to have that 200 grams fuller natural look ;)</li>
      <li>first off, its far off from 100g-- its not even 20inch.</li>
      <li>My hair is probably not even a full 10&amp;#34; long, and I pull these off very well.</li>
      <li>These will last you several weeks at the most.</li>
      <li>Arrived on a timely manner, and was in decent shape.</li>
      <li>There really fine and flimsy and the color was not right</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of hair extension experiences, and these are good for the price but not good overall.</li>
      <li>They came in 5 days with standard shipping..very fast since i live in NY..</li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to match platinum blonde or any blonde extensions you get really with your own</li>
      <li>I think they have great quality and its really not even that thin.</li>
      <li>I was really surprised at how soft the wefts were as well.</li>
      <li>The only downside is they are golden blonde instead of platinum.</li>
      <li>These extensions I use practically everyday, and I love them especially for the price.</li>
      <li>how does one person go from these extensions are so blonde they are almost white to someone saying they are super yellow?!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not TRUE human hair, but a synthetic and human hair blend (so don&#x27;t try to dye it for the most part, it is what it is).</li>
      <li>And when I tried to color them the right color they turned green.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re getting what you paid for, so if you want something that is long lasting and high quality, look elsewhere.</li>
      <li>There was something small and black on a few of the wefts, but it was easy enough to clean off, and I used them for coloring anyway</li>
      <li>I figured id try a something a bit cheaper with less hair, I didn&#x27;t need as much....</li>
      <li>They are super thin and dont blend with the natural hair.</li>
      <li>The ends were very thin and fine!</li>

<li> But I have in the past spent up to $80 for extensions of the exact same quality!</li>
<li> My hair is platinum and these are more of a dirty blonde..</li>

<li> , it’s a Chinese product made out of Chinese hair (black hair) and when processed to be blonde</li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t platinum, really thin, still had some black strands in it, cheap clips.</li>
<li> They lasted less than a month with weekend use only!</li>
<li> My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders and thick so if i were to wear the extensions straight i would need a second pack for thickness reasons.</li>
<li> You really need 2 or 3 packages the hair is really thin</li>
<li> Correct length but very stringy an thin.</li>
<li> The hair is very thin and they added real cotton string dark blue to it.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s all, other than that</li>
<li> Other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
<li> and it was extremely stressful at times.</li>
<li> The hair extensions are very soft and shiny, but it is so thin it doesn&#x27;t blend well with my hair.</li>
<li> Not worth it at all.</li>
<li> wide, so to say 20&amp;#34; long for a small piece!</li>
<li> The packet of hair contained thick black hairs woven in with the platinum blonde hair.</li>
<li> I really dislike these, they are extremely thin and NOT 20 inches, I am extremely dissapointed in this purchase, sucks.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use these everyday and after reading comments about it being too thin, I was a bit nervous. But I have in the past spent up to $80 for extensions of the exact same quality! Which says a lot about this product. First, the color matched so well with my hair that it was a little creepy! Also, they cover well under my short hair. My hair is probably not even a full 10&amp;#34; long, and I pull these off very well. The only adjustment I made to these is that I added more clips in between the ones already on the wefts. I think they have great quality and its really not even that thin. I have recommended these to my friends and I would definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> they came to me fast  was satisfied with the color it matches perfectly with my hair I just don&#x27;t recommend wearing it in humid weather because the extensions stick to your neck if you do and keep a comb or something with you incase of tangling good product for the price over all</li>
    <li> These extensions are way thin. Impossible to blend in my hair. If your hair is as long as the extensions, they may be good to add extra volume. Other than that, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. Not even buy two sets of these would be enough hair for me!&lt;br /&gt;These extensions are about as professional as buying hair wefts and doing it yourself, but I think you could do better. The clips suck. They&#x27;re hard to clip in your hair. You need to use more strength opening and closing the clips than you should. The clips are oddly placed as well. Hair quality is alright, but I can tell they&#x27;ll start feeling ratty in no time with added heat.</li>
    <li> These are the worst extensions any woman could ever buy. The clips won’t hold properly, and they are extremely thin! This didn’t even give me volume; I had to throw them away!&lt;br /&gt;I keep reading reviews saying you should order two of these.. guess what.. for the same price you can go to foxylockshairextensions.com and get a beautiful set of hair worth your money. Please DO NOT buy this, it’s a Chinese product made out of Chinese hair (black hair) and when processed to be blonde it ends up in 4 strings of hair… this is ridiculous!</li>
    <li> To the idiots who complain about it being thin: 100g means that this is thin hair. 120g+, means that it is thicker. Don&#x27;t complain when you ordered something that specifically says 100g.</li>
    <li> Correct length but very stringy an thin. Not worth it at all. Would not recommend to anyone that I know</li>
    <li> I really dislike these, they are extremely thin and NOT 20 inches, I am extremely dissapointed in this purchase, sucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of hair extension experiences, and these are good for the price but not good overall. They&#x27;re not TRUE human hair, but a synthetic and human hair blend (so don&#x27;t try to dye it for the most part, it is what it is). They&#x27;re a bit on the thin side, so if you want thick hair get two packets. The clips are very cheesy, expect to readjust them throughout the day. I always had problems with being afraid whether or not they came out of my hair and it was extremely stressful at times. You&#x27;re getting what you paid for, so if you want something that is long lasting and high quality, look elsewhere. These will last you several weeks at the most.</li>
    <li> I bought these because Halloween is coming and I wanted to wear them with my costume. It isn&#x27;t even Halloween yet and I&#x27;ve worn them everyday! I really like them. I was worried when I was reading a few reviews, but they are perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would tell people with thicker hair that if you want them, buy more than one set. I have thin hair and one set was perfect, so I am happy with what I got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color matches my hair perfectly. When I curl them, people don&#x27;t even believe me that I have extensions in! Now, for thin hair, they do come in a bunch of clips, so I sewed some together to make it less bulky in my hair and so I could use less clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these extensions!</li>
    <li> You really need 2 or 3 packages the hair is really thin but if you on need a little hair they would be great... I wish it was the color they said it was also its a yellow blonde... so I would say I aid with shipping like 90 dollars for 2 for one for a 120 dollars I could of went to a real beauty supply and got better quality so i am a little disappointed</li>
    <li> It came on time! It was clean! It was the perfect color! The ends were very thin and fine! Barely legal to say 20&amp;#34; long when it is a 5&amp;#34; wide piece for the widest part of your head gets to the ends and that area was barely 1&amp;#34; wide, so to say 20&amp;#34; long for a small piece! I am a licensed cosmetologist and purchased for my 20 year old daughter with great experience with hair extensions! But these tangled to fast! The extensions paddle brush I own which is amazing even pulled the hair out of the strands! Price was fair but these were not convenient or worth my money to buy again. They lasted less than a month with weekend use only!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t platinum, really thin, still had some black strands in it, cheap clips. Wasn&#x27;t what I expected, definitely a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> great price for great hair!!</li>
    <li> The packet of hair contained thick black hairs woven in with the platinum blonde hair. It did not match my hair at all and I had to return the product (which was very expensive to ship back).</li>
    <li> Terrible terrible hair. No need to waste your money on it. It&#x27;s so thin and didn&#x27;t even last me a month.</li>
    <li> Very poor hair extensions. If you&#x27;re thinking about buying them, buy them with no intention of ever dyeing, straightening, or curling them. I&#x27;ve been wearing them about 3 weeks and they&#x27;re already fried. I&#x27;m highly disappointed. :c Waste of my time and money.</li>
    <li> The hair is very thin and they added real cotton string dark blue to it. The sowing on them is very poor, and started to come undone . I have sent them an email as they requested instead of giving them a bad review, but never got so much as an email back. I won&#x27;t buy these again!!!</li>
    <li> Bought them for  my niece and she is very happy with them.</li>
    <li> I received the extensions 3 weeks before the estimated tome of arrival. Beautiful soft human hair. Can&#x27;t wait to rock these!</li>
    <li> They were awfully thin, and 2 or 3 inches at the bottom were so thin they looked like dead ends I would have to cut them to make them look better but then it would take away the length that I wanted.</li>
    <li> how does one person go from these extensions are so blonde they are almost white to someone saying they are super yellow?! isnt it the same product makes no sense. Im worried bc I ordered these yesterday for the underlayer of my hhair. I tried to dye it blonde and alot got fried off so I needed something quick...they arrive tomorrow hoping for a light blonde. really hope im not dissapointed!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like these extensions. They are real human hair and are sold at a great price. They were delivered to me very quickly! The only downside is they are golden blonde instead of platinum.</li>
    <li> The hair extensions are very soft and shiny, but it is so thin it doesn&#x27;t blend well with my hair.</li>
    <li> These are awesome extensions, very long and beautiful. Can&#x27;t even tell they&#x27;re extensions when wearing them. I Would recommend! Also, great customer service (;</li>
    <li> These are okay extentions I guess you get what you pay for them. There really fine and flimsy and the color was not right</li>
    <li> No offence, but this product doesn&#x27;t even deserve a 1 STAR! Listen to me seriously when I say DO NOT BUY... I have been using extensions for YEARS!! and the 70g that you buy from SALLYS are better then these 100g. first off, its far off from 100g-- its not even 20inch. the hair is probally about 17....I measured it.. the last pair I bought on amazon were from a different dealer and they we super nice.. I figured id try a something a bit cheaper with less hair, I didn&#x27;t need as much.... cause I was going to combine them. but the hair is gross, the clips are CHEAP! AND MADE OF PLASTIC...... stringy... its just horrible :/ im so unsatisfied.. Im never buying from this dealer again!!!! NEVER!! I plan on asking for a refund cause its tht bad!!</li>
    <li> These extensions are totally a different color than the picture advertized. They are very yellow not platinum blonde at all. They are super thin and dont blend with the natural hair. Overall they are not worth the money and they are very poor quality. The clips are really cheesey too.</li>
    <li> These extensions I use practically everyday, and I love them especially for the price. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to match platinum blonde or any blonde extensions you get really with your own but these fit/blend super well in my hair and the clips are thin so its easier to hide.</li>
    <li> The extensions were very thin i feel as if i can easily torn the hair away. They dont look 20 inches either more like 15</li>
    <li> I have wanted to try clip in extensions for awhile and didnt think they were very affordable until I saw these. They matched my hair so well and added so much volume. I love them and get complements about my thick beautiful hair every time I wear them.</li>
    <li> The color matched my hair perfectly. I was really surprised at how soft the wefts were as well. My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders and thick so if i were to wear the extensions straight i would need a second pack for thickness reasons. When i wear them curly they blend in perfectly though. They came very fast and I was impressed.</li>
    <li> These are very good quality HUMAN hair extensions for $50!! They are only 100grams so deffintly suggest buying 2 packs! My first extensions i had before these were from headkandy.com and 22\\&quot; 180 grams... those were/are amazing!!! but i found these clips are way better than the headkandy ones!! Also... these are way lighter in person.. almost white! They came in 5 days with standard shipping..very fast since i live in NY.. Anyway all in all great for price but im deffintly buying another pair to have that 200 grams fuller natural look ;)</li>
    <li> I ordered these in hopes to thicken my thin hair. I didn&#x27;t find that these were too thin, but that&#x27;s because I already have thin hair so they blended in nicely in that way. So if you have thick hair you may want two. What didn&#x27;t work for me was the color. These came very yellow, and didn&#x27;t match my hair at all color-wise. And after waiting about two weeks for them to get here I was very excited only to see the color didn&#x27;t match. I don&#x27;t have white hair by any means, but I don&#x27;t have yellow in my hair either. And when I tried to color them the right color they turned green. So I gave them to a co-worker who dyed them brown and they matched her hair fairly well</li>
    <li> My hair is platinum and these are more of a dirty blonde.. I&#x27;m very bummed out. They are good quality so I might use them under mine to make a nice contrast.</li>
    <li> These extensions are very lovely! They are very very long and they stay in your hair all day :D there is nothing wrong with the texture they are just a little thin that&#x27;s all, other than that, they&#x27;re perfect (:</li>
    <li> Arrived on a timely manner, and was in decent shape. There was something small and black on a few of the wefts, but it was easy enough to clean off, and I used them for coloring anyway so wasn&#x27;t a big deal. I would definitely purchase from seller again, was a very good price I would have paid double the amount if I bought in a store where I live.</li>
