    <li> Mambo italiano, lol Maybe it&#x27;s the Italian in me (you know what I mean) that&#x27;s got me saying this, but if you want to attract a &amp;#34;woman&amp;#34; going out dancing or not, you got to try Mambo! For a long lasting great fragrance at an affordable price, Hey Mambo, Thanks!</li>

    <li> This is really light fragrance like Realm or Aqua Di Gio(Armani). Woman absolutely love this scent. Its not Musky or too flowery its just the right balance. The smell is very peaceful.

    <li> I bought this as a gift and it was the right size and right smell. I don&#x27;t actually know what it smells like because it was for someone else. I have not received any complaints, so it gets 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> Nothing but nice compliments!!! I walk in a room and heads turn asking what&#x27;s the cologne your wearing. I tell them it&#x27;s a secret!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne based on the reviews and was very impressed.  It lasts long and smells very clean and masculine.  Definitely a different smell than I normally go for.  This is one of my staple colognes now.</li>
