<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great non-drying soap for keeping skin clear</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product for slightly oily, adult skin.  It cleans&lt;br /&gt;thoroughly without removing the moisture.  It cuts thru make-up and leaves the skin feeling hydrated and so clean.  Great fresh, but not perfumy, smell.  It is very hard to find, even in a unique organic store, so I buy more than one bar on Amazon.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Excellent very good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> THis soap is great if you have rosacea. Will not make the condition worse and I think makes mine better.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  Has really freshened her skin.  Says her face has never looked better.  it is a good price</li>
    <li> wonderful soap.  Even with sensitive facial cleansers, often my face would turn bright red.  This soap feels great, and I didn&#x27;t even really need moisturizer after using it (I&#x27;m 62.)  Love this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, a tiny bit drying, but it smells fine and hopefully it helps calm my mite-allergic skin.  I use it in the shower, usually with some Ambi soap on my body scrubber too.</li>
    <li> I have been using TheraNeem soaps for 18 months and it has been amazing for my perioral dermatitis.</li>
    <li> Excellent if you have acne.</li>
    <li> This has neem and sea buckthorn in it and is wonderful for the acne sufferer.  I bought it from a local co-op but you can save money here on Amazon.  Only problem is that neem is not recommended for use if trying to conceive or pregnant.  mind you I have been reassured that the quantity in a soap or lotion cannot have a reproductive effect but I am a paranoid person and will therefore probably hold off on using until after our next child is born.  As far as neem and sea buck soaps go, this is the one I would stick with if you have acne.  You&#x27;re going to want to moisturize, I recommend a nice argan oil.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I get out of shower with my skin squeaky clean.  No under arm odor either which is a nice extra benefit</li>
    <li> This soap gives your face a nice clean feeling.  Don&#x27;t wash with it every day during the winter season since it will dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> All around WONDERFUL soap! Did not cause blemishes at all, yet deeply moisturized. (: Was even nice as a shampoo! Left my hair soft and never oily! YAY! Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> This soap smells wonderful and seems to help my skin. I have eczema (hands and feet type) and have been trying different products to help keep it under control. Neem has come up in my research and does seem to be helping my eczema. This soap by far is the best product I have tried containing neem. Neem is not known to smell good but in this product they have overcome that factor. I would recommend this item and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> Great product and it was delivered extremely fast!</li>
    <li> Saw this product on Dr. Oz and bought it last year for my daughter who has acne that we cannot control.  She uses it every day and the bar lasted an entire year.  She said her skin feels wonderful after using and requested another bar for Christmas this year.  She won&#x27;t use anything else, even carries it with her on vacations</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really say much about this soap because I only ordered it once. I&#x27;m sure it will be beneficial with continued used, but I have combination skin and had to use a different soap after using this. However, it has a pleasant scent considering it is made out of Neem leaves.</li>
    <li> This is a great complexion soap. Gentle and beautiful</li>
    <li> Great soap! Great to use on your face. Easy and nice soap to use on your face, gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry your face out.</li>
    <li> I like the soap, its some oily , so works ok for very dry skin. This is really apropietty for damage skin, dry, or acne. I really recomendet, the only thig is the size</li>
    <li> This soap bar is so gentle on the skin, and leaves it very soft. I love it! Organix South is really great at offering it at a much better price than my local stores!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap on and off for years.  Neem is a skin friendly product.</li>
    <li> I think it helps a great deal.. I purchased it for my son and he isn&#x27;t here to ask really how he likes it... but does seem to be some improvement</li>
    <li> This really was kinda pricey for such a small bar of soap.  I mean the price itself is not too bad, but the shipping cost on top of that is a bit much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I just used it today and it works well in that it did not irritate my skin at all and I have extremely sensitive skin and eczema. I read complaints about a smell--really? It is so minor of a smell and it does not linger at all! I am sensitive to smells already and on top of that I am pregnant.  I can barely smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: it left me feeling a little dry after the shower.  Might be because I used a washcloth--not sure. But, I always lather on the lotion after every shower anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> This product is as described. It is amazing for my sensitive skin without drying or leaving me too oily. It arrived quickly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It&#x27;s so gentle and I feel so refreshed after use. It cleans thoroughly leaving without a trace/residue of make ups! What I like more with this is, this soap is purely made out of natural ingredients!</li>
