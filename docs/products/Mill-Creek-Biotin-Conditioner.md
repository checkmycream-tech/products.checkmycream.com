      <li>good price</li>
      <li>So, I was very pleased when I found this on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>Then, I wasn&#x27;t able to get to the health food store to get it anymore.  </li>
      <li>I really love this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love these products and have used them for years.  </li>
      <li>My hair love it.</li>
      <li>I love the Mill Creek Biotin condition.  </li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>It has a nice mild peppermint smell, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell like a candy cane.</li>
      <li>was becoming a pain in the tush.</li>
      <li>If you are super sensitive, you may have a problem w/ the mint, but if your not, ah it feels good.    </li>
      <li>This shampoo gives a clean feeling and leaves body in your hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair is full and shiny, and stays that was, even in humid weather.</li>
      <li>Conditioner was wrapped good, but when I opened it, there was a mess.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this order!</li>
      <li>It has a minty scent to it and really leaves your hair feeling thicker after using it without the greasiness.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair really tangled.</li>
      <li>When I use it on my dry hair it feels so smooth</li>
      <li>I bought it initially because of the keratin content, which I use to counteract the damage of super bleaching hair.  </li>
      <li>I would HIGHLY suggest that you buy the shampoo and conditioner together.</li>
      <li>My three year old has eczema and had lost most of her hair due to the issue.  </li>
      <li>Cleans well, but you need to use a little bit more each time than with a normal lathering shampoo.</li>
      <li>Mill Creek is shown to have a higher Biotin (B vitamin) content than any other brand.  </li>
      <li>I ordered Biotin shampoo ahd conditioner at the same time,and I was very surprised that conditioner came seperate two weeks later than shampoo.</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty much a waste of money.  </li>
      <li>It seems to sink right into your hair shaft, as there is very little to rinse out.</li>
      <li>After using them both my hair is so soft and bouncy after letting it air dry.</li>
      <li>Actually had to cut down using this product to every one or 2 weeks, as my hair was growing really fast and having to do a weekly root job</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My three year old has eczema and had lost most of her hair due to the issue.  I bought this product and the moisture balanced everything out and her scalp began to improve and produce hair!</li>
    <li> Although the biotin makes the hair seem thicker it does make your hair a bit frizzy.  If you color your hair&lt;br /&gt;It does strip the color quicker then using a shampoo for colored hair.</li>
    <li> Great product.      I bought it initially because of the keratin content, which I use to counteract the damage of super bleaching hair.  Bonus was the peppermint oil, which cools the scalp after bleaching. If you are super sensitive, you may have a problem w/ the mint, but if your not, ah it feels good.    Actually had to cut down using this product to every one or 2 weeks, as my hair was growing really fast and having to do a weekly root job was becoming a pain in the tush.</li>
    <li> I ordered Biotin shampoo ahd conditioner at the same time,and I was very surprised that conditioner came seperate two weeks later than shampoo. I bought another shampoo and conditioner of course.Conditioner was wrapped good, but when I opened it, there was a mess. Conditioner all over the bottle.I&#x27;m very dissapointed with this order!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times, but already know it isn&#x27;t going to work because I won&#x27;t use it again.  Every time I wash my hair with this conditioner it leaves my hair lifeless, dull and strips it of it&#x27;s body.  I am very disappointed and am going to try to return it since I still have a full bottle that I won&#x27;t be using.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair really tangled.</li>
    <li> When my hair began to thin I searched for corrective measures to rejuvenate my scalp.  One of my choices is B vitamins, both internally and in my shampoo and conditioner.  Mill Creek is shown to have a higher Biotin (B vitamin) content than any other brand.  My hair is now growing in twice as thick.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years...love it</li>
    <li> 3dr one I have bought.  I love the Mill Creek Biotin condition.  It work great.  When I use it on my dry hair it feels so smooth and I will recommend this products.  I have used it times and I have notions that my hair is not coming out like it was. A good product.</li>
    <li> excellent for your hair growth</li>
    <li> This I got with the shampoo, it also is great. My hair love it. After using them both my hair is so soft and bouncy after letting it air dry. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love these products and have used them for years.  I am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and this means your hair is changing it&#x27;s texture.  This shampoo gives a clean feeling and leaves body in your hair.  I recommend this product.  I used to use the Mill Creek brand(Biotin), years ago.  Then, I wasn&#x27;t able to get to the health food store to get it anymore.  So, I was very pleased when I found this on Amazon.</li>
    <li> great conditioner, makes hair stronger and fuller.</li>
    <li> Millcreek Botanicals Biotin Shampoo does not contains any sodium laurel sulfate, parabens, or artificial colors, BUT, it does contain sodium myreth sulfate, octyl dimethyl PABA, potassium sorbate, and botanical fragrance. Cleans well, but you need to use a little bit more each time than with a normal lathering shampoo. It has a nice mild peppermint smell, but it&#x27;s not so strong that you smell like a candy cane. I have bad allergies and can not use any products with lavender or fragrance (parfum). Even though this has botanical fragrance, it does not bother my allergies.</li>
    <li> The product works well. It has a minty scent to it and really leaves your hair feeling thicker after using it without the greasiness. Overall i wish the product was a bit bigger but it is something i will definitely continue to use.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is very thick that often times, it does not completely rinse out.  I&#x27;ve noticed a few times after using it, I can still feel the product in my hair after blow drying it.  My hair does &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; thicker, so I do like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty much a waste of money.  I don&#x27;t know what it was supposed to do but it didn&#x27;t soften or even detangle my hair.  I got about half way through the bottle and decided to buy something else.  This is now in the guest bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this conditioner. I&#x27;ve been pairing this with the Nexuss Biotin shampoo for the month or so and there has been a visable difference. My friends and family have been pointing out my hair looks a bit thicker.</li>
    <li> I really love this conditioner. It smells nice and has that perfect peppermint feeling on the scalp. I would HIGHLY suggest that you buy the shampoo and conditioner together. I find that the shampoo leaves my hair feeling stiff but my hair comes back to life with vengeance after using this conditioner!</li>
    <li> purchased for son.  good price</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It seems to sink right into your hair shaft, as there is very little to rinse out. My hair is full and shiny, and stays that was, even in humid weather.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for just over two weeks now. It leaves my hair hard to comb after washing. I have medium length hair, that doesn&#x27;t normally knot too bad, but seems to after using this conditioner.</li>
