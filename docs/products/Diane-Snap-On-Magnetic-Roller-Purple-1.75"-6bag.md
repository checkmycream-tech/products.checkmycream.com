      <li>I love these rollers, I have this color and the orange.  </li>
      <li>Okay</li>
      <li>but they came in only 3 days which was awesome!</li>
      <li>I bought these rollers ten years ago and they are still in excellent condition.  </li>
      <li>Also the snaps make the roots straighter and holds the hair in better.  </li>
      <li>These rollers are more of a hazard to one&#x27;s hair than a help.</li>
      <li>and I was able to get it in my hair quicker.  </li>
      <li>Ok, but don&#x27;t stay in my hair well.</li>
      <li>I like curlformers much better than the magnetic rollers because they get to your roots.  </li>
      <li>They are MUCH easier to use and more effective than the velcro rollers, which required all kinds of clips to stay in (and even then did not stay in very securely).</li>
      <li>They work pretty good and keep your hair smooth.</li>
      <li>Clips and bobbie pins hurt when I have to use them to secure a roller - that&#x27;s why I love these</li>
      <li>Easy, Breezy.</li>
      <li>These curlers being magnetic make it easy for the rulers to stay in your hair.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>The magnetic rollers I originally had are by Conair and they worked fine, but these snap on rollers are much better.  </li>
      <li>Ok, fun.</li>
      <li>Great for roller sets and extra curls in longer hair.</li>
      <li>I use a leave-in protein finishing gloss on each section that goes into a roller, e.g. smooth and shine spray on polisher.  </li>
      <li>These rollers are mostly smooth on the outer edges</li>
      <li>And this seller has free shipping too.</li>
      <li>They fit together well</li>
      <li>These rollers are cheap plastic snap-ons.</li>
      <li>Rollers are so cheap because they are junk.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t curl and cheaply made</li>
      <li>semi-okay if my hair didn&#x27;t get caught up all over the rollers and pull the curls apart in a very frizzy kind of way.</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE these for my natural hair</li>
      <li>Easy to use, great magnetic hold, a must have for long hair needs.</li>
      <li>These are super quick and my favorite rollers.</li>
      <li>Sleep on it and carefully take out in the morning when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works beautifully for me.</li>
      <li>I tried it about six times, changing small things each time, until I found the way that would work best for my hair.</li>

      <li>I will clean them off after awhile though.  </li>
      <li>These rollers are also easy to rinse up afterward, and the price was right on them.</li>
      <li>and it comes out pretty easy.</li>
      <li>I always use these rollers with keracare wrap set lotion and love the results -- smooth, soft and shiny curls.</li>
      <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure this will be my new go to style after a hairwash.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering  another pack :) especially now that the hot weather is on it&#x27;s...no more blow dryers.</li>
      <li>I was hoping to find some easy rollers that could hold the amount of hair that I have and that were comfortable enough to sleep on.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to try it, just be patient if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to try it, just be patient if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the quality is better than expected - much sturdier!!!</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for size is perfect large enough to give me volume vs tight curls.</li>
      <li>As my hair gets longer, I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments daily on my hair and no one believes me when I say that I don&#x27;t use a curling iron every morning.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t have in the first place.</li>
      <li>It also only took me 20 minutes to roll my hair with these, whereas the velcro ones used to take me more like 45-60 minutes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to putting my own rollers on my head and these make it so easy for my thick texture.</li>
      <li>Easy to use but left creases in my hair and didn&#x27;t stay put</li>
      <li>These rollers are not as large as I thought they would be.  </li>
      <li>Pure garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>These weren&#x27;t quite as large as I was hoping to find (I wanted a minimum of 2\\&quot;) but decided to try them anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was able to roll my hair tightly right down to my scalp with these Diane rollers, and they didn&#x27;t budge even when rinsing out the perm solution under running water.</li>
      <li>I have these in a few different sizes and not that happy with them.  </li>
      <li>Like any curler, you can&#x27;t put too much hair in at a time.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really even use these anymore now that I have curlformers</li>
      <li>To do a whole head, you will need three or four packages.</li>
      <li>Very</li>
      <li>Very</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Left hair more wavy then actually curled.</li>
      <li>Using these rollers allows you to minimize the damage to relaxed straight hair that can be caused with direct blow drying and curling irons.  </li>
      <li>I had to buy more than one due to my long hair.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend for women who need large rollers for long hair.</li>
      <li>Sticking with the extra large velcro rollers from now on.</li>
      <li>These rollers will just slip off, so you have to work really hard to make sure those are anchored beyond the snap that is provided.</li>
      <li>After using them with the snap for awhile I decided that the snaps may cause damage to my hair near the roots and now I just use the rollers with pins and it&#x27;s still easier to put in my hair than the Conair roller&#x27;s that I have.</li>
      <li>Really a pain to have to return such an inexpensive item.</li>
      <li>Hard plastic curlers for a long hair curl  Great to curl wet hair for that big curl.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t loop it too tight when you get to the ends of your hair at the other side otherwise</li>

    <li> I really enjoyed this product  I wish it was subscribe and save and prime</li>
    <li> The rollers didn&#x27;t want to stay rolled, kept falling down after I would get the hair really tight in the roller. Left hair more wavy then actually curled.</li>
    <li> Ok, but don&#x27;t stay in my hair well.</li>
    <li> I have thick, slightly wavy hair and they work great.  Like any curler, you can&#x27;t put too much hair in at a time.</li>
    <li> These curlers being magnetic make it easy for the rulers to stay in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great deal for a discounted price here!!! Haven&#x27;t used them yet, but the quality is better than expected - much sturdier!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> They are what I expected but I don&#x27;t like them.  Read the other reviews and still purchased them to see for myselft.  They fit together well but they left a line in my hair that showed where the roller had been.  The lines did not comb out and I ended up having to flat iron my hair anyway.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for the volume I wanted to recreate with my hair. Great for roller sets and extra curls in longer hair.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re not that great because they do not grip that well.</li>
    <li> I gave these a try in my bid to find healthy ways to define the curls in my waist-length, very thick, wavy hair. I hate using curling irons or hair dryers or hot rollers (which never really work on me anyway since my hair is so heavy it would just pull the curl straight down) so I tend to sleep on two braids or twist damp hair around an elastic headband (this works extremely well, by the way. I&#x27;ll detail it at the bottom). I was hoping to find some easy rollers that could hold the amount of hair that I have and that were comfortable enough to sleep on. These weren&#x27;t quite as large as I was hoping to find (I wanted a minimum of 2\\&quot;) but decided to try them anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I don&#x27;t understand why they say these are magnetic when they are clearly not. They are simply hard plastic with a hard plastic cover that snaps on through a tight fit rather than any magnetic properties. Even with a tiny bit of hair on the roller, my hair is long enough that it was extremely difficult to get the plastic cover to snap on over it. But I did it after a bit of work and then let my hair sit like that all day on a Saturday. I had been planning on trying to wear them to bed but I noticed the hair was completely dry so I figured I&#x27;d see how the curls turned out. They probably would have been semi-okay if my hair didn&#x27;t get caught up all over the rollers and pull the curls apart in a very frizzy kind of way. My hair was HUGE when it finally came out and definitely not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure these rollers are great for people with shorter hair than me. For me, it was just way too time consuming and too uncomfortable to consider trying again. I get amazing results from five minutes of work before going to bed so I&#x27;ll continue with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found that works:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Get an elastic headband (I use [[ASIN:B00284W03Q Scunci No-slip Grip Flat Black Headwraps, 9mm]] but any elastic headband should work)&lt;br /&gt;2. Dampen the hair. I&#x27;ve found that spraying with a spray bottle gets the hair too wet so I just get my fingers wet and run them through the hair. Don&#x27;t get the hair too wet! Very important!&lt;br /&gt;3. Put the headband on OVER your hair running along your front hairline down to the base of your head.&lt;br /&gt;4. Take a small chunk of hair on one side and twist it loosely away from your face and then tuck it over and under the headband so it loops it loosely and then dangles down with the rest of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. Add another segment of hair to it and twist it loosely together (away from your face again) and then loop it over and under the headband again.&lt;br /&gt;6. Repeat that for all the hair until you get to the other side. Make sure you don&#x27;t loop it too tight when you get to the ends of your hair at the other side otherwise your nice big curls will be weird tiny, frizzy curls at the ends of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;7. Sleep on it and carefully take out in the morning when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works beautifully for me. I get so many compliments daily on my hair and no one believes me when I say that I don&#x27;t use a curling iron every morning. If you&#x27;re going to try it, just be patient if you don&#x27;t get it right the first time. I tried it about six times, changing small things each time, until I found the way that would work best for my hair. The main trick is though, NOT to get your hair too wet. Otherwise the curls twist and it looks reminiscent of dreads. Good luck!

    <li> Fast shipping. Great product! Works perfect.</li>
    <li> I used them once, only had it on for like a half hour and they worked, but it came on time</li>
    <li> I ordered these and was a little concerned when I didnt get a trackink number in my email but they came in only 3 days which was awesome! And this seller has free shipping too. Okay so I am an African American woman with long almost wait length natural hair and I wanted some rollers that would Allow my hair to dry faster than the sponge rollers I had been using/ not cause tangles like the velcro ones either. I love this I used about 30 on my damp almost dry and it dried so soft and bouncy in loose curls! It only took my hair 3 hours to finish drying where as I need either a blow dryer or 10 hours in a sponge set from start to finish.. yes I know, but I have REALLY thick and coily hair. I bought 6 packs but I probably could have gotten away with 5, I&#x27;m not complaining though. I went back and bought the pink ones for a tighter curl. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these for my natural hair &amp; I&#x27;m sure this will be my new go to style after a hairwash.</li>
    <li> Terrible, rollers are not magnetic. Rollers are so cheap because they are junk. I know there are some good reviews on this product but they have to be made up or something because I wouldn&#x27;t even use them if they were the last styling product on Earth. I hope this reviews saves someone from wasting time and money.</li>
    <li> If you have curly,thick hair,dont get this.It&#x27;s too small to hold any of it and it comes out pretty easy.Maybe for straight or wavy but not for thick curly haired people.</li>
    <li> I bought a few packs of these rollers to replace some velcro ones I&#x27;d been using for years to relax my hair at home. (I have shoulder-length, thick, very curly hair, and I use large rollers with perm solution to relax my curl, especially to un-kink my roots.) For my purposes, these snap-on rollers are perfect. They are MUCH easier to use and more effective than the velcro rollers, which required all kinds of clips to stay in (and even then did not stay in very securely). I was able to roll my hair tightly right down to my scalp with these Diane rollers, and they didn&#x27;t budge even when rinsing out the perm solution under running water. It also only took me 20 minutes to roll my hair with these, whereas the velcro ones used to take me more like 45-60 minutes. These rollers are also easy to rinse up afterward, and the price was right on them. Five stars!</li>
    <li> I got them two days after I ordered them! They work pretty good and keep your hair smooth. I didn&#x27;t have a problem with the clamps denying my hair,</li>
    <li> The plastic is quite flimsy with sharp bits at the edges and seams. The seller will accept the return, at the expense of my paying for shipping, because he/she doesn&#x27;t consider this a defect. So rollers with sharp bits are normal, and a feature not mentioned in the product description? Ok, fun. Return shipping will cost me the same amount that I had paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Annie&#x27;s and Salon Care brands make snap on rollers with better construction and materials. This plastic is shiny and somewhat translucent with the aforementioned sharp bits.</li>
    <li> The rollers are cheap plastic and very poorly made. I might just use the snap on part with my other magnetic rollers. I don&#x27;t want to rip or snag my hair on these rollers. The holes look like they were created in someone&#x27;s garage.</li>
    <li> These rollers are great! Roll, snap and go. Easy, Breezy. I will be ordering  another pack :) especially now that the hot weather is on it&#x27;s...no more blow dryers. Yay!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great magnetic hold, a must have for long hair needs. I highly recommend for women who need large rollers for long hair.</li>
    <li> These are super quick and my favorite rollers. Rolling is as simple as wrapping moist hair around the barrel and snapping to get a tight grip on the root (I have 3a/3b hair). I always use these rollers with keracare wrap set lotion and love the results -- smooth, soft and shiny curls. I use a blow dryer with an attachment to remove any lines left by the snap on piece.</li>
    <li> I have not used rollers in a long time. I like the snap ons. Easy to use. I had to buy more than one due to my long hair. I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have thick 4a texlaxed hair, I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to continue using the flat iron as often and decided to do roller set&#x27;s.  I love these rollers, I have this color and the orange.  I decided to buy these because I was tired of putting in the magnetic rollers that need hair pins.  The magnetic rollers I originally had are by Conair and they worked fine, but these snap on rollers are much better.  They are wider and hold more of my hair, also the make of it is really great it doesn&#x27;t have any bumps that can snag your hair.  I also noticed that after applying my leave in and oil the roller still has the leave in and oil on it, so I&#x27;m thinking that every time I use these I&#x27;ll have additional moisture.  I will clean them off after awhile though.  The first few times I used these I used the snap&#x27;s and I was able to get it in my hair quicker.  Also the snaps make the roots straighter and holds the hair in better.  The disadvantages are that the snaps leave a line in your hair, so I comb out each section put my hair in a ponytail and wrap the ponytail into a doughnut style bun and tie my hair up.  This helps to get rid of the lines a little bit.  If the lines are a big bother you can just put a few in the front with pins instead of the snaps.  Another thing is that the rollers feel tight at the root. After using them with the snap for awhile I decided that the snaps may cause damage to my hair near the roots and now I just use the rollers with pins and it&#x27;s still easier to put in my hair than the Conair roller&#x27;s that I have.</li>
    <li> These rollers are cheap plastic snap-ons. They have no magnetic components like the description would have you believe. The snap on plastic pieces didn&#x27;t have a hope of holding my hair in the roller. Total dissapointment. Sticking with the extra large velcro rollers from now on.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t curl and cheaply made</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using these rollers, they are a great size. These gave my hair the perfect amount of curl &amp; body.</li>
    <li> These rollers are not as large as I thought they would be.  They are still great and don&#x27;t fall out, no pins!</li>
    <li> These did not do any good !!!!!! i would never ever reccomend them to any one !!! !!! !!! !!</li>
    <li> They stay in - even on dry hair.  As my hair gets longer, I will definitely buy more. Clips and bobbie pins hurt when I have to use them to secure a roller - that&#x27;s why I love these - they have the snap on thingy that holds without pain.</li>
    <li> Easy to use but left creases in my hair and didn&#x27;t stay put</li>
    <li> Definitely not magnetic. Takes some practice to get used to these since their is absolutely no traction to keep the hair in place. I have to use clips to keep them in my hair. Perfect size though.</li>
    <li> Hard plastic curlers for a long hair curl  Great to curl wet hair for that big curl.  Ideal to sleep in, and use instead of hot  iron.</li>
    <li> I have these in a few different sizes and not that happy with them.  They dont stay in my hair all that well</li>
    <li> bigger than I thought- kept-  sturdy- as presented</li>
    <li> Perfect for roller wraps!</li>
    <li> Pure garbage.&lt;br /&gt;I had to throw it away as I do not allow junk into my house to take up space I don&#x27;t have in the first place.</li>
    <li> I did not like this product, I have ordered these before and had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;These I ended up throwing away.</li>
    <li> Ad and packaging say magnetic, but these rollers are 100% plastic.  Really a pain to have to return such an inexpensive item.</li>
    <li> I do not perceive any magnetic properties about these rollers.  Also, these rollers are not designed to give loose curls or ringlets.  The rollers are too wide for that.  However, these rollers work extremely well for setting relaxed straight hair with a wet set. I use these to do a wet roller set.  You will need metal clips to hold one roller to the other (clip two rollers together on each open side) to get the rollers to be tight enough to ensure that your relaxed hair dries perfectly straight and smooth. I use a leave-in protein finishing gloss on each section that goes into a roller, e.g. smooth and shine spray on polisher.  The plastic is hard, but slightly flexible and increases with flexibility over time (several years), which makes setting your hair even easier. To do a whole head, you will need three or four packages. Using these rollers allows you to minimize the damage to relaxed straight hair that can be caused with direct blow drying and curling irons.  I bought these rollers ten years ago and they are still in excellent condition.  So, despite the lack of magnetic properties, I am giving this product five stars.</li>
    <li> Great sized rollers for the price. Bought three packs and fits my head perfectly. I&#x27;m new to putting my own rollers on my head and these make it so easy for my thick texture.</li>
    <li> Quality control is not what it use to be. These rollers are more of a hazard to one&#x27;s hair than a help. They have very sharp protruding bits where the holes are. I suspect this is from the tooling of the product. They should have been sanded down but were not. I would not recommend buying these UNLESS you have time to go through each hole and file always the sharp bits that could cut your hair strands.</li>
    <li> These rollers are mostly smooth on the outer edges and so my hair has nothing to stick to while I am trying to use these. These rollers will just slip off, so you have to work really hard to make sure those are anchored beyond the snap that is provided.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for size is perfect large enough to give me volume vs tight curls. Just purchased a hard hat sit under dryer with the hope of eliminating the need for a lot of heat to style my hair.</li>
    <li> Not in a resealable bag works like expected</li>
    <li> Product was as described but you can find it a lot cheaper at your local beauty supply store.  I don&#x27;t really even use these anymore now that I have curlformers [[ASIN:B003JMYU20 Curlformers Salon Kit]]Which are sold by sally on amazon, but if you go on sally actual webesite they are cheaper because you can always find some 25% or 20% coupon code.  I like curlformers much better than the magnetic rollers because they get to your roots.  I am natural so these work perfect.  I guess if you get your hair relaxed the magnetic rollers would probably work best since they are a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see why they&#x27;re called magnetic rollers when there are no magnets to them. They&#x27;re just pieces of plastic. I&#x27;ve tried using them with a hair dryer and leaving them on overnight. The curls don&#x27;t last long. You can only put up to one, maybe inches of hair in there if you don&#x27;t want any strands to come out. I&#x27;m trying to avoid hair spray or heating products, but I guess one can&#x27;t have curls without them. On the plus side, they&#x27;re cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All things considered, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
