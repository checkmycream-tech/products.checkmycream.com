### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>:P</li>
      <li>Tresemme is a good product and this one is just as great but 9$</li>
      <li>really good thing</li>
      <li>I never feel the need to switch shampoo brands because this one has been so good to me.</li>
      <li>It does give weightless bouncy more voluminous hair!  </li>
      <li>I read a raving review about how amazing and life-changing this shampoo is, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a whirl.</li>
      <li>Nice scent too.  </li>
      <li>great this is useful for me.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t some miracle worker where my hair is now amazing like in those commercials, however it did give me more body and my hair felt</li>
      <li>Really good quality product at a cheap price.</li>
      <li>Tresemme Healthy Volume leaves my hair clean and gives good volume.  </li>
      <li>I love the conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo over 2 years, and I love the effect on my hair.</li>
      <li>So yes, I love this shampoo and I will defiantly be buying it again.</li>
      <li>I will buy this again for sure.  </li>
      <li>My hair gets oily at the roots very quickly and even causes hairline breakouts.</li>
      <li>It does give my hair volume even though I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>It is clean, full and it shines!</li>
      <li>The larger size is a great value.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice scent and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>:) It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>Overall, I could use this shampoo for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy.</li>
      <li>I use it daily and my hair always feels and looks great.</li>
      <li>If I blow-dry my hair, it looks great for about 20 minutes, at which point all volume goes away, and my hair is flat against my head again.</li>
      <li>because i need this thing long time, and it is great.</li>
      <li>Not to mention, I&#x27;ve tried other TRESemme shampoos and LOVED them (the shampoo AND the price tag!)</li>
      <li>The shampoo itself is clear, like a gel, which is really nice because I can&#x27;t stand it when you are using a colored shampoo and the gunk on your scalp</li>
      <li>This is definitely my new favorite shampoo.  </li>
      <li>+shipping and handling fees was way to much for it when another Tresemme product for more then half that price would have done just a good job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a volumizing shampoo that would really work on my hair - particularly one that would provide volume that lasts more than an hour or so after a blow-dry.</li>
      <li>I guess you can say more textured and less fine.</li>
      <li>I even noticed that it looks better on the second day after washing.</li>
      <li>I could spend 2-5x more on a product and get the same results.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, what remained in the bottle had a nice scent and worked well with my thin, fine hair.</li>
      <li>She did say it made her hair very silky.</li>
      <li>but it leaves hair very light and not weighed down.</li>
      <li>And one more slightly embarrassing thing...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s hair is thinning.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t really give your hair substantial volume as I expected, but it&#x27;s not bad at all.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
      <li>this shampoo makes my hair shinny and soft.</li>
      <li>After the first wash so far my hair feels extremely clean which is very rare, so after reading reviews from different websites I would have to say this product is not for dry, thin hair, but seems to work wonders on other hair types.</li>
      <li>I have very fine thin asian hair</li>
      <li>I have purchased this product from Amazon many times over the past few years.  </li>
      <li>hair is probably more flat and limp than it&#x27;s been in the past ten years.</li>

    <li> I have very fine thin asian hair so I&#x27;ve always had problem with flat hair. This wasn&#x27;t some miracle worker where my hair is now amazing like in those commercials, however it did give me more body and my hair felt I guess you can say more textured and less fine. I like how it works like it says it does and is affordable too. I don&#x27;t use anything else now. :) It&#x27;s definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is definitely my new favorite shampoo.  It gives your hair body and softness.  I will buy this again for sure.  I love the conditioner as well.</li>

The shampoo itself is clear, like a gel, which is really nice because I can&#x27;t stand it when you are using a colored shampoo and the gunk on your scalp turns whatever color the shampoo is.... and anyways... :P So yes, I love this shampoo and I will defiantly be buying it again.</li>

    <li> Shampoo arrived with a loose lid.  You know what that means.  Yep, goo all over.  Thankfully, at least they had the foresight to bag it separately or it would have mingled with the green powder drink mix which ALSO leaked - all over everything in the box.  Anyway, what remained in the bottle had a nice scent and worked well with my thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very soft and manageable. I wouldn&#x27;t say it gives me a ton of extra volume but it leaves hair very light and not weighed down. It has a nice scent and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Contradictory to it&#x27;s name, my friend who I purchased it for complained it did not give her hair any volume. She did say it made her hair very silky.</li>
    <li> great this is useful for me. because i need this thing long time, and it is great. really good thing</li>

I have purchased this product from Amazon many times over the past few years.  I have never been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
    <li> my fave shampoo.  I have thinning hair and it gives me some body.  wouldn&#x27;t wash with any other.</li>
    <li> This product truly keeps its promise.  My thinning hair is noticed for its &amp;#34;full volume&amp;#34; every time I use this shampoo.  I highly recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s hair is thinning.  It is clean, full and it shines!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I started using this shampoo a while ago. It doesn&#x27;t really give your hair substantial volume as I expected, but it&#x27;s not bad at all. And one more slightly embarrassing thing... I don&#x27;t wash my hair regularly, and it would usually get oily and stick together, but this shampoo can keep my hair clean for several days and not too oily; although not completely clean, but the difference is substantial. I even noticed that it looks better on the second day after washing.</li>
