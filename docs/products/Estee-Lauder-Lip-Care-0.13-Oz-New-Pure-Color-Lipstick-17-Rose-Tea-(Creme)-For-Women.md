      <li>but great!!</li>
      <li>Very good product presentation.</li>
      <li>Great lipstick stays on six hours</li>
      <li>great item, as described</li>
      <li>Love the color, wonderful feeling on my lips, very smooth</li>
      <li>I purchased this to compare with Bois De Rose, I would say this matches me so much more.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice light color for light skinned girls.</li>
      <li>this is my favorite lipstick ever, goes with everything.  </li>
      <li>My wife was completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
      <li>Lovely color, but basically unusable.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Either the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; lipsticks are flimsier than the featured line, or more care needs to be taken in mailing them because the lipstick arrived cracked at the bottom, which means that it rubs on the tube.  </li>
      <li>I love the color of this lipstick but it arrived damaged.  </li>
      <li>Its light weight, its a deep rose color, staying power isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
      <li>the color is just ok, nothing special.</li>
      <li>It is a nice color and a good, creamy, long wearing E L lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Just what was expected, and at a very good price.</li>
      <li>The tubes were not as shown in the fancy cosmetic counter container, but rather the free sample sort of container.  </li>
      <li>The packaging is really cheap and simple, although i wish it were more, i&#x27;m quite satisfied at the price and wouldn&#x27;t mind repurchasing again.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think the lipstick is  worth the price that I payed for it.</li>
      <li>Color was right, but mine arrived rancid and not in a package.  </li>
      <li>It was delivered in a timely fashion and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>The shipping fee was higher than the cost of the lipstick.</li>
      <li>Got this free with another purchase at local Estée Lauder counter.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Reviews helped to make sure that the correct product was ordered (vs. other shades).</li>
      <li>I am tan (Hispanic) and it looks very natural on me.</li>
      <li>Im a fan of EL skincare and receive their makeup as samples and so far they&#x27;ve been nothing</li>
      <li>If you like to put lipstick directly on your lips, I&#x27;d skip the mailed sampler tubes.</li>
      <li>but i rather to have a little more dark when used it</li>
      <li>I can use it somewhat with a brush, especially since it is so soft.  </li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t transfer the lipstick to a small container and apply it with a brush, most of the lipstick will be wasted in the tube.  </li>

    <li> This is a very nice light color for light skinned girls. I even like the smell. Very good product presentation. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The lipstick arrived broken and stuck in the tube.  I can use it somewhat with a brush, especially since it is so soft.  Lovely color, but basically unusable.</li>
    <li> The wrong color was sent - not even close to what I ordered. The shipping fee was higher than the cost of the lipstick. I am about to return it and pay another shipping fee</li>
    <li> Great lipstick stays on six hours</li>
    <li> It is a nice color and a good, creamy, long wearing E L lipstick.  The tubes were not as shown in the fancy cosmetic counter container, but rather the free sample sort of container.  Either the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; lipsticks are flimsier than the featured line, or more care needs to be taken in mailing them because the lipstick arrived cracked at the bottom, which means that it rubs on the tube.  If I don&#x27;t transfer the lipstick to a small container and apply it with a brush, most of the lipstick will be wasted in the tube.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve had this happen with an E L &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; lipstick ordered from Amazon, although different sellers.  If you like to put lipstick directly on your lips, I&#x27;d skip the mailed sampler tubes.</li>
    <li> great item, as described</li>
    <li> Got this free with another purchase at local Estée Lauder counter. I am tan (Hispanic) and it looks very natural on me. Very moisturizing. Love it.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite lipstick ever, goes with everything.  I will never be without this color in my purse</li>
    <li> I always have a problem finding the color I like, never thought I would find it on line.  Love the color, wonderful feeling on my lips, very smooth and I&#x27;m hard to please.</li>
    <li> Just what was expected, and at a very good price. Reviews helped to make sure that the correct product was ordered (vs. other shades).</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lipstick but it arrived damaged.  I was very disappointed and returned it for a refund.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this ..this is the worst order that I have ever made...lipstick melts and bends and it does not worth the money......sorry..there was no option of no star!!</li>
    <li> Im a fan of EL skincare and receive their makeup as samples and so far they&#x27;ve been nothing but great!! I purchased this to compare with Bois De Rose, I would say this matches me so much more. Its light weight, its a deep rose color, staying power isn&#x27;t that great. The packaging is really cheap and simple, although i wish it were more, i&#x27;m quite satisfied at the price and wouldn&#x27;t mind repurchasing again.</li>
    <li> My wife was completely satisfied with this product.  It was delivered in a timely fashion and was exactly as advertised.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Color was right, but mine arrived rancid and not in a package.  Looks like it may have been used once.  Threw it away.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think the lipstick is  worth the price that I payed for it. the color is just ok, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I like Estee Lauder products</li>
    <li> I like it but i rather to have a little more dark when used it</li>
