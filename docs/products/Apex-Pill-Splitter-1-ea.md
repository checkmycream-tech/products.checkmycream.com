      <li>Rinses and dries easily</li>
      <li>I thought they would just fall apart perhaps, but this cutter gives a smooth and easy cut and gets the job done.  </li>

<li> It&#x27;s a real work horse and the blade is always sharp...  </li>
<li> You will wait for a long time before you get this delivered</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t crush very small pills, splits them right in half..</li>
<li> It even cuts big Calcium Citrate pills perfectly in half..</li>
<li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
<li> Small enough to carry in my purse.</li>
<li> Cuts pills sharply and evenly; has room to store cut pills.  </li>
<li> it can&#x27;t cut small pills well at all</li>
<li> What a waste of money!</li>
<li> I was skeptical about buying a pill cutter for the very tiny pills I need to cut up for my cat.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it has very poor quality and what seems to be a dull blade, so I really cannot use it.</li>
<li> Because of the poor design, the pill &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; just gall through the cracks.  </li>
<li> Go to CVS and price how expensive all the pill splitters are there</li>

    <li> Works great, use it all the time</li>
    <li> did not work. can not see the pills</li>
    <li> perfect size, great prize, blade cuts wonderfully</li>
    <li> Cuts pills sharply and evenly; has room to store cut pills.  Small enough to carry in my purse. The company was very good about keeping me informed of the status of my order every step of they way.  It arrived before the estimated delivery date.  Would definitely use them again.  I now have three of these pill-splitters-- one for each level of the house and one for my purse.</li>
    <li> I have this splitter for many, many years and never had a problem with any size pill. It even cuts big Calcium Citrate pills perfectly in half..Just line them up straight across. It doesn&#x27;t crush very small pills, splits them right in half.. It&#x27;s the best you can buy and worth double the price. It&#x27;s a real work horse and the blade is always sharp...  Go to CVS and price how expensive all the pill splitters are there and none of them are as good as this one. . This same Apex splitter sells for $9.98- $11.98 on Ebay..Sears sells it for $20.</li>
    <li> This is NOT an Apex cutter!  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Because of the poor design, the pill &amp;#34;crumbs&amp;#34; just gall through the cracks.  What a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Simple as can be. Does everything it is supposed to do, as advertised.</li>
    <li> Pill spliter works great!</li>
    <li> Happy works great for all pill sizes. Delivered as promised !</li>
    <li> It does not split 50/50 regardless of how many round pills I have tried. Ok product for the price.</li>
    <li> Great pill splitter. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, it has very poor quality and what seems to be a dull blade, so I really cannot use it.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PICTURE.</li>
    <li> Pill cutter doesn&#x27;t cut accurately.</li>
    <li> Received quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> Works well, making clean cuts.</li>
    <li> Cuts better than any other pill cutter I have ever used even on the tiny pills.&lt;br /&gt;M</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying a pill cutter for the very tiny pills I need to cut up for my cat.  And there are a LOT of them!  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money and figured it would be better to spend less in case I wound up throwing the cutter out when it didn&#x27;t work.  Well this works like a charm, even on these really tiny, smooth, round pills.  I thought they would just fall apart perhaps, but this cutter gives a smooth and easy cut and gets the job done.  I recommend this.  I couldn&#x27;t believe there were pill cutters out there that cost 3x as much.  This one does the trick!  I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Very handy/simple.  Rinses and dries easily</li>
    <li> it can&#x27;t cut small pills well at all</li>
    <li> cheap piece of plastic for big price.  Go to Walmart and get the $.88 version they have.  Its at least as good as this unit.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Cuts pills evenly without sticking to sides.</li>
    <li> Works well. You will wait for a long time before you get this delivered and you will have no communications on delivery.</li>
    <li> Great product.  It break the pill in 2 just like it said it would do.</li>
