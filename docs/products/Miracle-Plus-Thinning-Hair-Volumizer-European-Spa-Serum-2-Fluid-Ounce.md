    <li> Feels like it truly opens follicles. Not made hair flat or greasy. Growth is yet to be determined as only have used one Week.</li>
    <li> I purchased the product for the first time a few weeks ago and my hair did get thicker while using the product, so the product works.  However, at this point I think I have reached the amount of thickness that I need, so I will not be purchasing another bottle (note: my hair was not that thin to begin with but it did get thicker/fuller) but it&#x27;s good to know that I only needed one bottle to see the results.  I would recommend the product to those looking for a hair volumizer.</li>
    <li> I have just started using it so I can&#x27;t rate it yet</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful !  I see a difference when I blow dry my hair !  It has a minty sort of smell but you don&#x27;t smell it after you dry your hair !  I like it!</li>
    <li> This product does add volume to thinning hair.  It doesn&#x27;t grow hair that I can see but it does give a fuller look.  i continue to use it.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS WONDERFUL.HOPEFULLY IT WILL NEVER BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET. I WISH THE LAS CRUCES, NM AREA WOULD CARRY IT. I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER IT UNTIL THEN.&lt;br /&gt;BARBARA WALSH... NEW MEXICO</li>
    <li> Used an entire month and didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! This product gives so much volume to the hair, feels so refreshing to massage on the scalp...I see some hair growth too. I LOVE this product :)</li>
    <li> This really works! I had a surgery in the front half of my skull and my hair is already growing and I have only had this product for three days!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;And just to let you know; I have tried &amp;#34;every&amp;#34; product out there, even men&#x27;s!!  and I spent a lot of money! For products that did not work! This one does I give you 10 stars thank you so much very grateful....&lt;br /&gt;  Sincerely yours Jennifer Marciano</li>
    <li> This does add volume to your hair but it will not help with any underlying thinning issues. If you want a quick fix for thinning hair this will definitely do it.  I used it while I addressed the underlying issue of thinning. I have textured hair and it was best used at night.  If I used it before styling it would have been a mess.I like that it does not have all the junk that some other products may have. I use primarily all natural products on my hair and that has helped tremendously with thinning overall.</li>
    <li> This is my second order and I will continue using Miracle Plus European Spa Serum.  Besides adding volume, it makes my hair much more manageable and conditioned.  I love the very pleasant minty smell!  This small bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff</li>
    <li> I use it when my body perm starts to weaken .It really works to give body to my hair.I always keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nioxin hair thickeners to boost my hair&#x27;s volume, but it made my scalp extremely itchy due to all the chemicals. This is perfect and volumizes while not harming my scalp.</li>
    <li> Yes I  Tried it but didnt see any results just volume</li>
    <li> Awesome product~ Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> The hair has grown out at least an inch or more in the thinning areas within 2 weeks of using the product.</li>
    <li> Very impressed! I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. Adds instant volume. Definitely a great find!</li>
    <li> I always look for the product which can help me to enhance my hair volume and grow faster. This product is worked for me. I am going to order 2nd bottle. If they have bigger size, that&#x27;s perfect!</li>
