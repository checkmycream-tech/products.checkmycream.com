<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is not really a &amp;#34;bronzer&amp;#34; more of dark spray with gold glitter. Not suitable for face. Cant really imagine an adult liking this unless you were extremely white.</li>
    <li> The tan was nice but the spray got all over my bathroom. Cleaning up bronzer from in between my grout sucked. Tried it standing in the tub but then my tub was covered in a mist of brown that was noticeable when it got wet.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF ACTUALLY WORKS AND THE COLOR IS AWESOME!!! I WAS NERVOUS THAT I WOULD END UP LOOKING LIKE A CARROT BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE!! Try it!! For the price you really can&#x27;t go wrong ...</li>
    <li> Nice dark color, which I like. the smell isnt too bad either. It has moisturizers which make my skin feel very smooth after applying. and i like the shimmer it gives with the bronzer.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used any spray tanner at home, I&#x27;ve always gone to professionals so I was wary when I ordered this. But I was extremely suprised and please when I got it, it came earlier then the delievery date plus the product was amazing. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and this product truly does tan you instead of making your orange like other spray tanners and it also has a little shimmer to it when applied. It has a pleasent scent that&#x27;s not over powering plus it goes on easily and evenly. I will definately be reordering this product again.</li>
    <li> The bronzer in this spray tan is great. Visible after a few hours if you don&#x27;t rub it in but I recommend rubbing it in so you don&#x27;t get splotchy.</li>
    <li> im a medium brown skin tone and  decided to give this a try because my tan was fading alittle and this made ee SO ORANGE!! Have no idea why there are so many good reviews on this !! This stuff sucks.</li>
    <li> This spray is great. It is pretty dark so fair skinned people beware, I am medium skin-toned and it&#x27;s perfect! LOTS of shimmer at first application, smells good, &amp; color lasts! I&#x27;m pleased!!!</li>
    <li> sprays nice and the color isnt orange.  I would highly suggest making sure to double check where you have sprayed so you dont have tiger strips like I did the 1st time I used this.</li>
    <li> Very streaky ! and blotchy was not happy with the result we got from it from it at all. Thought it would be better.</li>
    <li> I love the product it does exactly what it was promoted as doing and I&#x27;m not yellow or orange I have a beautiful tan that looks very natural</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and fun to wear and guess what!?!? It has glitter in it!!!!! Smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Produces great color, not orange. It&#x27;s a little tricky to apply and after a day or two it doesn&#x27;t look as good as when first applied. Tends to wear off unevenly, depending upon area you used it for. I would recommend use for legs, stomach, arms, etc.... I would not recommend for neck or face. It definitely does not wear/last as well around the neck area.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more noticeable tan, like the one you get with JWOWW&#x27;s self tanning spray. But this is so subtle that it&#x27;s hardly even there. When it says &amp;#34;bronzing&amp;#34; that is all it&#x27;s going to do- a slight bronze. I would suggest putting this on in the morning or before you go to the beach or something like that because there is some shimmer in it, which might come off if you wear it to bed. I won&#x27;t be buying this again because I need more of a tan than this gives.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t streak! This is great. I&#x27;m buying more. smooth color. Drys fast. If you want it to dry real fast use a blow dryer and you can put your clothes on and it wont fade it.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.. It works really well with no orange color as long as you use sparingly. Another plus is that it smells great:-):-) A definate buy if your looking for that summer glow.</li>
    <li> Makes you look dirty and it&#x27;s runny very  disappointed 😧</li>
    <li> My like loved it so much she tweeted Snooki and said how amazing the product was. Snooki retweeted it.</li>
    <li> I have used almost every self tanner around, including air brush tan booths.  I tried this today and WOW!!!!  I am medium-fair completed.  My father walked in and said &amp;#34; my goodness you are so tan&amp;#34; .  This is one of the deepest darker tans I have ever had that did not appear fake, or blotchy.  I ordered three more bottles as I am in love with this stuff.  I want to spray my sexy Italian boyfriend and see him bronze like me!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Not too orange. You can see it as it sprays on. I will always be having this on hand! Great product.</li>
    <li> I love it but a little pricie.</li>
    <li> For 23 dollars and some change I was expecting a new bottle, instead the bottle feels half empty and is taped shut with clear tape.  I dont appreciate that or want to even open it.  Thanks for robbing me.  You should specify that its a used product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Gave a nice instant tan, did not look orange, I would use it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this over Jwow simply because you get more for your money but this stuff is awful! I exfoliated and then applied two coats. The next morning I was excited to see my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; but there was no tan. I may have been a shade darker, that&#x27;s it. Jwow spray tan works so much better!</li>
    <li> Ordered product on a Monday night and received it this morning (Friday). I have yet to use it, so for now I&#x27;m just writing to say the shipment was pretty quick! I will give my updated review on actual product as soon as I apply it! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This bronzing spray is awesome and smells good also. I read reviews that said not to try it on your face but I did and it looked great but I only used a small amount.</li>
    <li> I bought this and it looked good at first but after a week it started flaking away and wouldn&#x27;t reapply</li>
    <li> I have tried so many self tanners and this is definitely one of the best. Perfect bronzy brown and dries so quick. No mess, except if you don&#x27;t put a towel down. No self tanner smell either!!! Just bought another can!</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!!! No streaks --- very easy to blend.... great color!!!! So happy with the results! Will definitely buy another !! :)</li>
    <li> Love love love this stuff, never streaks and last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love the fact that this does not smell like sunless spray at all! While the color is not as dark as others I have tried (I usually need to do 2-3 coats to get the level I want) it sprays on very evenly, and dries quickly with no streaking, dripping, or concentrated splotches. It does take a little longer for the color to appear - it is not as &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34; as other sprays, but you will start to see results an hour after application. It is not orange/red, but rather a light brown color. Also, huge fan of the fact it contains mild gold shimmer - it really makes the color glow!</li>
    <li> Love this! I have tried so many different products and took a chance on this one.  This has become my go to spray tan. I love the color which is not orange its a beautiful bronze.  The spray is perfect.  Not a lot of overspray so everything doesn&#x27;t become a mess. Its quick drying and I can put my makeup on minutes after.  I now buy this in bulk because its a must have. I am fair skinned and everyone year round thinks I have beautiful tanned skin.  Definitely a must have!</li>
    <li> Nice bronze color. Dries quick</li>
    <li> This will be my 6th purchase of this product! I have to say that I LOVE this stuff! Goes on even, smells great and gives great results! I tried the jwoww brand and it was nothing close to this...I will say that jwowws does better on my face than snookis. I highly recommend this to anyone! I will continue purchasing this asfir as long as the product is available!</li>
    <li> Pls don&#x27;t waste your money.. Doesn&#x27;t do much at all .. Will never buy again!</li>
    <li> Very fine mist. Good product although you need to spay a lot for good coverage.</li>
    <li> I hate self tanners but love the snooki brand tanning lotions so I figured I&#x27;d give this one a try. I absolutely love it. I really only use it on my chest, face and arms but it goes on evenly and smells good. And I love the shimmer it gives you!!! I would recommend this I anyone looking to get a bit more color in between seasons!!</li>
    <li> This spray isn&#x27;t near as dark as the jwoww spray and doesn&#x27;t last longer than a day ! Little disappointed</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! My husband couldnt even tell I used a spray he thought I went tanning!! He can always tell too and tells me when I look orange so that is saying alot!! I always spray in a dry shower too doesnt get everything covered in tanner!</li>
    <li> Does what it says an doesn&#x27;t look orange wich I love!</li>
    <li> I really love this spray! I&#x27;ve used jwowws, Pauly D&#x27;s &amp; the Situation&#x27;s &amp; I really love snooki&#x27;s the best! It has a bronze shimmer to it unlike the others. What I love the most  was how the tan gets even tanner hours later &amp; the next day I&#x27;m even darker!!! I highly recommend this spray tan! I&#x27;ve tried many others &amp; this is by far my favorite!</li>
    <li> I just bought this snooki instant tan. Shipping was super fast and the product is awesome. It spray&#x27;s out evenly and gives me the perfect color. I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> this stuff worked so good, I saw all the positive reviews so I knew it would be good, but not this good! it was so easy to apply, took less then five mins, which is such a big plus for me, cus I normally don&#x27;t have time for this stuff no matter how much I want to use it, and it was instant pretty not orange but natural tan, and it lasted, and the spray bottle was not only pretty, but super easy to use ALL over my body all by myself! this is the best spray tan there is, I have tried way to many and gave up, glad I gave it one last shot with this, I will buy more this week and use this all the time now. I have to make sure I keep this stuff! so I recommend this as a must must have!</li>
    <li> When you spray tan you may not be even so this is a great product to make things even again and it&#x27;s quick and easy.  Just make sure you shake it up really good before using or it will run.</li>
    <li> Great product!! The tan lasted for about 4 days. It gave me a wonderful bronze color, I thought it would make me orange but it didn&#x27;t. It also leaves you a little sparkle on your skin.</li>
    <li> Ew! Ew! Ew! Sticky &amp; gross! I was so excited, too because I used to work in a tanning salon &amp; we got free samples of this. I do not remember it being sticky, but glittery so you could see where it goes. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what, but this was not how I remembered it!</li>
    <li> no streaks!!!! love this! used dozens of self tanners and this is the BEST!! dries quickly! three hours set time before water.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! This product is awesome! It smells great, dries quickly, has an immediate subtle color and shimmer to it and is a big bottle!! Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I have tried all different kinds fo tanning sprays and i really like this!!!  I mainly use it for my face and my arms but i am constantly getting compliments on how tan i look and how natural it looks!!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy tanning spray with Snooki&#x27;s name on it, for fear of turning orange and developing a sudden craving for muscle-bound men and bar crawls. LOL&lt;br /&gt;After trying it out I was pleasantly surprised; the spray applies evenly, without streaking or sploches. There&#x27;s no unpleasant odor, it dries quickly with a nice bronze tint that has a bit of shimmer. This is definitely my new favorite! Great product, excellent price, amazing color. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This product does change your skin color, but not in a good way if you have light-ish skin! If you have a base tan, maybe it won&#x27;t look so bad, but this turned me a terrible orange and I had to endure at least 2 weeks of hearing &amp;#34;Umpa lumpa&amp;#34; from my husband and son!</li>
    <li> I only got this to spray on my face because it&#x27;s paler than the rest of my body. I wash my face twice a day and this will usually stay on underneath for 2 days tops then it is off completely. During those 2 days I can smell it all day long. It goes on evenly and it&#x27;s not orange so I will use it for those days when I am going to the beach or pool and want to cover up my pale face while tanning lol.</li>
    <li> It is hard to spray evenly.  They used to make a foam that I LOVED  but they no longer make that.  I wish they would go back to the foam.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bronze instant color at all as indicated by name.  I figured at least the tan would show up after putting it on before bed.  It doesn&#x27;t really give much tan at all.  Wanted it much darker.  Scent is nice initially though.</li>
    <li> IT WAS ALRIGHT... WOULDN&#x27;T PURCHASE IT AGAIN, BUT HAD TO MIX IT WITH OTHER PRODUCTS TO GET AN EVEN LOOK</li>
    <li> I purchased this bronzing spray to enhance my tan. I&#x27;ve heard many horror stories about spray tans &amp; bronzing sprays making you look orange.My daughter was excited to try it first because many of her friends use similar products. My daughter who&#x27;s bi-racial (African American and Caucasian) and has a light golden complexion LOVED the results. I was so amazed at how she literally glowed! I was so excited to try it after seeing her results. I&#x27;m Caucasian and use platinum level (12 minute) tanning beds twice a week btw. I was amazed at the instant color results from a light sweeping motion back and forth to cover my chest area. I would recommend light coverage the first time you use this product because the color develops with time, and you end up actually darker in a few hours. I&#x27;m placing another order this week because this is a must have for summer!  It&#x27;s a great product, goes on easy, no orange color and smells better than I expected. This product was a perfect match for two different skin tones. Totally worth a try for less than $20.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Snooki Sunless spray! It goes on my skin evenly and leaves a golden/brown glow on my skin. It also has a good smell and people always ask me how I get my skin so dark and I tell them about this product!</li>
    <li> I have a tan and used this for a few spots that were missed via tanning bed, works great, great sprayer and not too much orange.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a product that completely rules out orange afterglow with these type of self tanners, but I found used sparingly- no such effect!</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of tanning sprays.  Pros: it does not have a funky smell and it doesn&#x27;t make you look orange.  It has a very natural color to it.  Cons: you do have to use it modestly around your knees, wrists and ankles like any other spray tan.  This product will streak if you don&#x27;t get every spot. I would not recommend using this product on light skin.  Product dries in about 10 minutes.  This is a great spray tan to use to enhance color on an existing tan.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE Itwould shop again i loved the way the spray went on its a great product very happy would shop again</li>
    <li> It goes on and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks (if you are careful).  Would recommend this over the JWOWW crap. Blah blah.</li>
    <li> i cannot even put to words how much i love this spray, this was the first time i ever used a spray tan and my skin is a light olive since it is winter, but i usually tan very dark, and this product looks natural and smells kinda like cotton candy, with a shimmer! drys relatively fast, and brown not orange. i have used many different self tanners, but i think this is the ultimate tan in a can! will buy this product again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> I love snooki, and wanted to try this spray tan, unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t good, I mean if you are tanned already it maybe ok for you, but if you are fair in colour buy two cans cause you will use one very very quickly , doesn&#x27;t give that deep colour, definitely will stick to another one I&#x27;ve been using</li>
    <li> One word Amazing! Goes on so easily and you can see the color right away, I felt tan already! Smells great unlike other self tanners def an A+ purchase!! Only going to use this going forward, simply the best snooki you rock!</li>
    <li> It looks great on and stays for awhile. I love it! I def recommend it and will order it again</li>
    <li> I liked this sunless spray. If you use it correctly the spray tan turns out nice &amp; even. The only downfall is if u don&#x27;t moisturizer daily, it comes off blotchy after a couple days. Overall this product was a success in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I was  really excited to use this im a huge fan of snooki ❤️ Got it yesterday sprayed a little the smell was great well today decide to use it and the smell smelt like a deAd possum that&#x27;s the best way I can described the smell!!! But it does work good love the color left me looking tan like I just left a tanning salon but the smell is awful!!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make a difference at all in color.</li>
    <li> Ive tried both jwow and snookis spray tan. Snookis didnt get me tan enough and wasnt instant. I will continue purchasing jwows for this reason. Snooki needs to correct this</li>
    <li> Good smell, lasts a few days &amp; good for touch ups.</li>
    <li> This tanning spray is the best tanning spray I&#x27;ve ever tried ! It&#x27;s a beautiful that shimmers when is placed on your skin I will buy more of these tanning bottles</li>
