      <li>I love this product!!</li>
      <li>Feels amazing!</li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, staying power, too strong to use for my face</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as good as this.</li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this product yet till I fully feel I gave it a fair try.  </li>
      <li>I will continue with it for now to give it a fair chance to do what it promises.</li>
      <li>if I keep using it for 2 or 3 months or so, but the price seems fair</li>
      <li>It smells good and has a dense moisture.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with my experience at Amazon.com..</li>
      <li>Best of all it never flakes or balls up-it goes right in.</li>
      <li>The price is amazing.  </li>
      <li>The Olive oil gives it an anti-oxidant effect and it is VERY EASY to use.</li>
      <li>Great price for such a great product.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I can still find it online.</li>
      <li>Love how it feels and makes my skin feel.</li>
      <li>have used this product for many years.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is phenomenal too.</li>
      <li>glad l</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, and the serum has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>I think it is more like a light creme than a serum.</li>
      <li>As long as they offer this product I will be one of their satisfied and happy customers.</li>
      <li>The bottles are huge and for 5 bucks apiece, I had to use this as body lotion.  </li>
      <li>Even my man commented on how smooth my chest feels.</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply and surprisingly it does make my neck look smoother and less wrinkly.</li>
      <li>now I have a full bottle still and can&#x27;t get any of the lotion out.</li>
      <li>It really did smooth out the fine lines and improved the texture of my neck and chest.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product from them and on that special day I received many compliments on how young I looked.</li>
      <li>The second that stuff touched my skin, I knew it would have amazing effects..</li>
      <li>Never greasy or sticky, just leaves your skin soft, smooth and suppple!</li>
      <li>why I like it is that it keeps the neck soft and moisturized so the skin is better prepared for stronger products.</li>
      <li>I think it will be useful in the futher if I continue using it .</li>
      <li>The texture is OK, but I have not noticed any major improvements yet.  </li>
      <li>Very rarely do you get something better than expected</li>
      <li>This serum smells kinda strong, but the smell goes away fast enough for me to use it.  </li>
      <li>I was very upset when Dove took it off the market.</li>
      <li>but this product is better than any other I have used.</li>
      <li>(prefer Roc Multi-Correctional Night cream for face) as I have oily skin and olive oil is one of the main ingredients.  </li>
      <li>and this is exactly the same for a much lower and realistic price.</li>
      <li>People tell me quite often, that I look younger than what I really am.</li>
      <li>I am trying to contact DOVE directly.</li>
      <li>It takes away the crepiness of my chest and makes it feel so soft.</li>
      <li>That mean as you moisturize your neck more you&#x27;ll see results.</li>
      <li>Pump worked for the first few days</li>
      <li>My daughter was getting married in a few months</li>
      <li>I only have wrinkles on my neck from weight gain and weight loss and no loose skin or pebble texture.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found this item in a local drug store. It was marked down because it was being phased out. I thought I would give it a try. I loved it! Being over 50 has caused concerns for changes in my skin. My neck and chest were showing signs of aging and I was looking for something to help. I found it! It really did smooth out the fine lines and improved the texture of my neck and chest. When I ran out I began to panic. I could not find this product in any local stores. My daughter was getting married in a few months and I had chosen an off the shoulder Mother of the Bride dress. Help! I searched the internet and compared sites. I was very pleased with my experience at Amazon.com.. I purchased this product from them and on that special day I received many compliments on how young I looked. I would recommend shopping with them. As long as they offer this product I will be one of their satisfied and happy customers.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 at once after reading the other reviews.  I just had knee surgery and wanted something not greasy to slather on while healing.  The bottles are huge and for 5 bucks apiece, I had to use this as body lotion.  Inner thighs, knees, elbows, my undermoisturized knee, underarms, and of course chest and neck (and breasts).  Smells wonderful, staying power, too strong to use for my face (prefer Roc Multi-Correctional Night cream for face) as I have oily skin and olive oil is one of the main ingredients.  I think every woman would be well advised to have a stock of the Dove Pro-Age Neck and Chest Serum on hand.  Feels amazing!</li>
    <li> Why do they no longer make this product? It is great . I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as good as this.</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast, and the serum has a pleasant scent. Very easy to apply and surprisingly it does make my neck look smoother and less wrinkly. I don&#x27;t know about the long-term effect if I keep using it for 2 or 3 months or so, but the price seems fair and I recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> The second that stuff touched my skin, I knew it would have amazing effects.. Even my man commented on how smooth my chest feels. The fragrance is phenomenal too. I have not used it that long to judge the longterm effects, but the way it made my skin feel instantly after is enough for me to keep using it. I generally have tight skin but my weakness is in the neck area where I can tell that I may have some sagging problems in the future. I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This is NOT a peptide or retinol anti-aging treatment nor is it on par with Lancome or Lauder neck cream so it will not repair deep wrinkles. But what it will do and why I like it is that it keeps the neck soft and moisturized so the skin is better prepared for stronger products. Best of all it never flakes or balls up-it goes right in. The Olive oil gives it an anti-oxidant effect and it is VERY EASY to use. That mean as you moisturize your neck more you&#x27;ll see results. I alternate this with olay micro sculpting cream and sometimes pure olive oil but use this at least once a day. I have seen a 50% improvement in two months. I only have wrinkles on my neck from weight gain and weight loss and no loose skin or pebble texture.</li>
    <li> I was very unhappy about the appearance of my neck. This product made an instant difference. Great price for such a great product.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and the seller sent it within 3 days!!  Very rarely do you get something better than expected but this is it!   I couldn&#x27;t find it in the retail store so I urge you to buy it here.  It smells so great too!</li>
    <li> I have not had this product but for only two days don&#x27;t know how it will work in the long run.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product yet till I fully feel I gave it a fair try.  Please check back again.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years.  glad l I can still flind it.  It isn&amp;#34;t availble in the stores here.Thank you.</li>
    <li> Did not see a lot of difference.  Will not buy again</li>
    <li> I also ordered a decollette pad and after about 2 weeks that I didn&#x27;t get it, I called to ask why it was taking so long, and the distributor said they were out of stock and it was going to take a little longer; I wish they had told me before so I didn&#x27;t have to wait all that time to cancel and order from somewhere else.  I did cancel and ordered from somewhere else anyway, given the terrible customer service (they also made me wait like 3 days to cancel my order!)....I&#x27;m in shock that amazon even deals with distributors like these...</li>
    <li> I will continue to buy this product.  The price is amazing.  I have tried the more expensive stuff and this is exactly the same for a much lower and realistic price.</li>
    <li> As for the seller, They delivered above and beyond what I have received in the years past. AAAA+++++&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for many years. It is a wonderful lotion and serum. I not only use it for my chest and neck, but my face also. I can no longer find it on the store shelves, which I think is a bad decision on the manufacturers part, but will continue to buy it here on Amazon. People tell me quite often, that I look younger than what I really am. I am 52.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for keeping me in stock, Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I am 70 and there are no wrinkles on my neck at all!  I attribute that to using a throat and neck cream at night and this one works great</li>
    <li> This serum smells kinda strong, but the smell goes away fast enough for me to use it.  The texture is OK, but I have not noticed any major improvements yet.  It may be too soon to tell.  However, it is a lot of cream for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought it because I think my neck needs care. It smells good and has a dense moisture. I think it will be useful in the futher if I continue using it . Wait it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an inexpensive  product and it seems to be working.  It&#x27;s a slow process but this product is better than any other I have used.I will continue with it for now to give it a fair chance to do what it promises.</li>
    <li> Pump worked for the first few days now I have a full bottle still and can&#x27;t get any of the lotion out. I understand this is not the sellers fault but I think this is a defective item. My money has been wasted. I am trying to contact DOVE directly.</li>
    <li> The product name is little misleading. I think it is more like a light creme than a serum. But, whatever they want to call it, the product is wonderful! I was very upset when Dove took it off the market. So, when I not only found it on Amazon; but at such a terrific price- I jumped on it! Love how it feels and makes my skin feel. I put it on as soon as I get out of the shower. Never greasy or sticky, just leaves your skin soft, smooth and suppple!</li>
    <li> I love this product!! I am so glad I can still find it online. It takes away the crepiness of my chest and makes it feel so soft.</li>
    <li> No objection to it. It feels soft but not much improvement.... Maybe I am not yet need to wear this at my age.</li>
    <li> Not better or worse than anything else. I didn&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> It works well. I am actually seeing a firmness of skin on my&lt;br /&gt;neck and chest. This product is not greasy.</li>
