      <li>/&gt;This was definitely a great purchase.  </li>
      <li>I especially love using it when the weather is warm.</li>
      <li>This is as good as my Etude House moisturizers without the inflated price</li>
      <li>soo moisturizing feels good on face overnight</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for moisturizing the skin .. but not that good..</li>
      <li>super lightweight and perfect for what i was looking for.</li>
      <li>Pretty happy with purchase!</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
      <li>And the scent is amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to wear during the summer, for it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>The texture is very light and dissolves fully into your skin.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a shame that it did not work for us, it has a nice smell and it feels nice and cool on the skin.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>the weather is cold/dry and my skin needs more moisture, I tend to layer this with a heavier moisturizing cream at night.</li>
      <li>Makes me feel like a rich lady every time I apply this!</li>
      <li>Because of how light it is, it is the perfect moisturizer for layering when your skin needs that extra moisture</li>
      <li>As my night cream, I find this to be the reason I wake up with soft, bouncy, happy skin.</li>
      <li>, The fragrance is way overpowering and is a strong perfume scent that lingers for hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit sticky, but not annoyingly sticky, well it is a gel, so that I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was originally for YEARS using cliniques moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I received a tester from the same product before and it was thinker and more effective</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light gel, and it&#x27;s very cooling and soothing when applied to the face.  </li>
      <li>Its nothing special.. just aloe gel</li>
      <li>Surprisingly it dries up relatively once it has been applied to the skin.  </li>
      <li>Light and smells fresh.</li>
      <li>Overall good product but underwhelming.</li>
      <li>It gives a pleasantly cool sensation when applied, and is very quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving any oily/sticky residue.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s given me clogged pores and acne breakouts like the kind I would get as a teen.</li>
      <li>This watery gel is a nice simple moisturizer.</li>
      <li>It is mild and very gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>but if u live in a very humid place in summer and need a very light moisturizer for beach or night I would suggest Nixon water pack moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I lost some product but for the most part, this is a really good moisturizer, especially for someone who doesn&#x27;t have really dry or oily skin.  </li>
      <li>Its leave a cool and gentle feeling to your face.</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this moisturizing gel to anyone with sensitive skin, as well as those looking for a good aqua gel moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The consistency of the aqua gel is very watery.  </li>
      <li>so I have no idea if it&#x27;s even real.</li>
      <li>This Water pack is very recommended for people who have oily skin</li>
      <li>Very hydrating</li>
      <li>It instantly absorbs into the skin, but it would make my T zone more oily later on.  </li>
      <li>This product  (water max aqua gel) needs to be massaged into the skin, but it leave it soft and smooth, and I don&#x27;t feel that oiliness later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t want to buy the expensive counterpart this is a great alternative.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin, and I don&#x27;t get pimples or clogged pores, but this also caused me to get some pimples and clogged pore.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is a very subtle scent which flies away quickly, but the scent is clean and sweet so it would not matter either way.&lt;br /&gt;For a much better price than my usual moisturizers, I received a lot</li>
      <li>It is non greasy very light and a good base to layer product.</li>
      <li>live in SoCal where it gets pretty dry</li>
      <li>have extremely sensitive skin and as such, can be very picky about products applied to my face.</li>
      <li>It seems to actualy dry out my skin yet make me really oily at the same time.</li>
      <li>My skin isn&#x27;t super oily in the morning, but my skin has been dry lately, and this isn&#x27;t helping much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The texture is very light and dissolves fully into your skin.It&#x27;s nice to wear during the summer, for it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Although it&#x27;s getting into winter season I still put on fully before going to bed to give my skin some water.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this moisturizer. This keeps my skin from getting oily! All the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, my T-zone always gets oily after an hour or two, but this product prevents it! Throughout the day, I would rub my nose to check if it was oily or not, and this actually managed to keep it matte.</li>
    <li> I bought this because its for combination skin. It&#x27;s a bit sticky, but not annoyingly sticky, well it is a gel, so that I didn&#x27;t mind. It has little to no scent, which I also didn&#x27;t mind. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel extremely moisturized when I put it on, but I think that&#x27;s what it is supposed to do. Otherwise, it would be a cream moisturizer. My skin isn&#x27;t super oily in the morning, but my skin has been dry lately, and this isn&#x27;t helping much. I put on multiple layers sometimes. It&#x27;s okay. It moisturizes limitedly.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want to buy the expensive counterpart this is a great alternative. It is non greasy very light and a good base to layer product. Moisture level is probable a 5 out of 10. Would definitely Not use it in winter but if u live in a very humid place in summer and need a very light moisturizer for beach or night I would suggest Nixon water pack moisturizer. Overall good product but underwhelming.</li>
    <li> super lightweight and perfect for what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky and contains a lot of alcohol. It seems to actualy dry out my skin yet make me really oily at the same time. I think that&#x27;s because my skin is freaking out from it, The fragrance is way overpowering and is a strong perfume scent that lingers for hours. Not only this but it&#x27;s given me clogged pores and acne breakouts like the kind I would get as a teen. Cheap and it didn&#x27;t come with an official mizon sticker so I have no idea if it&#x27;s even real. Also the box was opened and the jar was scratched up when I got it. Really disappointing</li>
    <li> This is a great day moisturizer for those with combination skin (like I have). I especially love using it when the weather is warm. It gives a pleasantly cool sensation when applied, and is very quickly absorbed into the skin without leaving any oily/sticky residue. This makes it ideal for applying under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the weather is cold/dry and my skin needs more moisture, I tend to layer this with a heavier moisturizing cream at night. Because of how light it is, it is the perfect moisturizer for layering when your skin needs that extra moisture boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and as such, can be very picky about products applied to my face. I definitely recommend this moisturizing gel to anyone with sensitive skin, as well as those looking for a good aqua gel moisturizer. It is mild and very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> The consistency of the aqua gel is very watery.  Surprisingly it dries up relatively once it has been applied to the skin.  The container I received had product dripping all over it.  I&#x27;m not sure why because the packaging looks intact.  I lost some product but for the most part, this is a really good moisturizer, especially for someone who doesn&#x27;t have really dry or oily skin.  This is as good as my Etude House moisturizers without the inflated price so I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
    <li> Its nothing special.. just aloe gel</li>
    <li> Makes me feel like a rich lady every time I apply this! I love it!!!</li>
    <li> This Water pack is very recommended for people who have oily skin i use this product a month now and it my skin very soft and white (its not good for the sensitive skin)</li>
    <li> As my night cream, I find this to be the reason I wake up with soft, bouncy, happy skin. This is my holy grail gel.</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this for herself for the dark spots left from her acne and to moisturize her oily acne prone skin and it caused her to breakout. Then she gave it to me hoping that it would work for me.  I have normal skin, and I don&#x27;t get pimples or clogged pores, but this also caused me to get some pimples and clogged pore. Maybe my daughter and I had an allergic reaction to it.  It might work for other people but this was just not for us, it&#x27;s a shame that it did not work for us, it has a nice smell and it feels nice and cool on the skin.</li>
    <li> The Gel like substance is perfect for oily skin users. I use this 3 times a week during the day. I noticed my scars have gotten lighter after using it I think thats because of the whitening solution in it. I am happy for this buy. And the scent is amazing.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Its leave a cool and gentle feeling to your face. Pretty happy with purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for moisturizing the skin .. but not that good.. I received a tester from the same product before and it was thinker and more effective</li>
    <li> I purchased this item as a replacement to my usual H2O moisturizer...&lt;br /&gt;Unlike usual water gel moisturizers, this gel is thicker, even with a small amount, but absorbs into the skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I live in SoCal where it gets pretty dry but I feel I can use this to protect my skin, even during the winter (where I usually switch over to thicker creams like Kiehl&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;There is a very subtle scent which flies away quickly, but the scent is clean and sweet so it would not matter either way.&lt;br /&gt;For a much better price than my usual moisturizers, I received a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was definitely a great purchase.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Feels a bit sticky for a daywear (like a night pack) but leaves skin hydrated.</li>
    <li> Light and smells fresh. Very hydrating</li>
    <li> I loooovveeee this moisturizer.  Its very...watery as the name implies.  It&#x27;s a very light gel, and it&#x27;s very cooling and soothing when applied to the face.  I have combination skin (oily in the T zone and normal to dry elsewhere) and this helps my skin feel balanced and moisturized all over, which is difficult for me to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was originally for YEARS using cliniques moisturizer. It instantly absorbs into the skin, but it would make my T zone more oily later on.  This product  (water max aqua gel) needs to be massaged into the skin, but it leave it soft and smooth, and I don&#x27;t feel that oiliness later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side about this product I would say is that it I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be good if you had really dry skin, or as a pre makeup base.  When I wear make up I like to apply this, and then some argan or moroccan oil as well before applying my foundation and concealer.</li>
    <li> soo moisturizing feels good on face overnight</li>
    <li> May edit review later&lt;br /&gt;Just started using it, not sure how moisturizing it&#x27;ll be. Makes my face burn when I put it on...</li>
    <li> This watery gel is a nice simple moisturizer.</li>
