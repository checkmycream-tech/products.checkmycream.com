<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This wig looks good in the picture, but it is awful in person. It&#x27;s pretty short, too. I returned it and got a refund.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite wigs.  The hair looks and feels completely natural.  I get lots of compliments when I wear this wig.  It came a tad long in the front (for my taste) so I trimmed it and now it looks gorgeous!  I enthusiastically recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I received my order early.. was very satisfied. purchased for my girlfriend &amp; she loved it..  the color and texture were just like the photo. wig seemed more black 2 me, but that&#x27;s what we wanted. so? I would buy this wig/ or order from this company again in the future. 5 stars from me. 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 wigs from this seller the first one was a lot fuller and thicker than the second one I bought. It shed a LOT and when I did use low heat on the ends they got all frizzy and kinda burnt. I wore this wig every day for about 2 months and it looks very realistic it doesnt look like a wig it looks more like a full head sew in weave. It has a good luster, its not really shiny. Its very bouncy. It is synthetic so it does tangle and knot pretty quickly. The color is like a 1/1b and its pretty long maybe about 18-20 inches (Im 5&#x27;1). The second wig I bought a week ago and its not as thick and full as the first one but it doesnt shed as much as the first one. Overall, I like this wig its cheap and easy to wear. Shipping is pretty fast and the wig is great! I&#x27;ve bought similar wigs from the beauty supply store and online and none of them were as good as this one. Its a great alternative if you dont have enough money for a human hair wig or need something quick and simple. I would recommend buying a human hair wig or making your own wig with human hair just because it lasts a lot longer and its easier to manipulate if you want to curl or straighten the hair. For a synthetic wig this one is definitely a go to for me.</li>
    <li> This review is for the Straight Long #2 Black Brown Wig with Bangs. The wig arrived clean and well packed with easy-to-follow care, use, and cleaning instructions. For a first time wig user, it was very handy to get a guideline sheet. This wig was purchased for stage use, and it looks stunning on stage. The wig looks so nice that I suppose one could go out shopping or dining whilst wearing it. The wig looks that good and is an amazing value for what it costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic fibres are very soft and manageable. The bangs are extra long, so you will need to trim them quite a bit. When I put the wig on for the first time, the bangs came down to the tip of my nose. So out came the scissors to get the desired length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig should fit anyone&#x27;s head with the use of the adjustable straps found on the inside cap portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP #1 It is recommended that one buy a wig cap [[ASIN:B0017UHCEY Wig Cap (Black) - One-Size]] to tuck one&#x27;s own hair in place before putting on the wig. That way you&#x27;ll get a better fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP #2 Use a wide toothed comb  [[ASIN:B00021CBAE SEPHORA COLLECTION Wide Tooth Comb Large Wide Tooth Comb]] to gently comb through the wig. If you can afford it, get a hand polished resin comb to cut down on static electricity and be extra kind to your wig [[ASIN:B000MPAU5I Mason Pearson Rake Style Comb]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TO SUM UP: I highly recommend this wig! Take care of it, and it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> this is a great wig. it looks like the picture and is a high quality product. the hair looks real and is thick and shiny. i didn&#x27;t have to cut it or anything, unlike the other buyers on here. my hair is longer than the wig so i had my hair in a bun underneath which may have contributed to this. i haven&#x27;t washed it or styled it yet, but i&#x27;m hoping the hair remains soft and shiny. the hair gets tangled a bit but can be brushed out easily. the net underneath is sturdy and has a clip at the back to adjust the tightness. my friends said i looked like a doll or an anime character. it&#x27;s cute! the seller had excellent customer service as well. great product!</li>
    <li> I got this wig pretty fast. I ordered it on the 7th and got it on the 9th. I got an email saying that I would get instructions on how to take care of the wig, but I didn&#x27;t find any. I&#x27;m pretty sure I will manage just fine, tho. Also, the wig in the picture is straight, and the one I recieved has a few waves in it, so it needs to be straightened. Luckily this is suppose to be heat-resistant fiber, so I can do that.     The wig itself? I think it is pretty.</li>
    <li> This was the worst wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I opened it expecting it to look like the picture it didn&#x27;t. However that didn&#x27;t even matter. The straps on the inside to make the wig smaller or larger to fit your head size. The part where you put the strap in to \\&quot;secure\\&quot; it. It was RIPPED ! I paid 50 dollars for this &amp; it was ripped. Disappointed. Would give it NO STARS if I could. I want a refund.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig, hoping that it would at least look like the picture, you know how sometime&#x27;s what you see is not what you get. Well i saw a beautiful wig, and received 2 days later with regular shipping!(FAST) the same beautiful wig. No lies. It feels smooth, looks real and fits perfectly. I am just going to say, if you like the looks of this you get what you like! Great Product, advise to anyone who&#x27;s looking for this style!</li>
    <li> i am really hoping a trip to a salon will help make this wearable. it is very long compared to the image and the bangs are super long. i have not even worn it and just gentle movement causes frzzies. too cheap to return and i am sure i will find a use for it.</li>
    <li> At first I thought 2 much hair but when I crinkled it up I was like hellz yea lol sista got 2 hit the club lol I&#x27;ve gotton so many compliments and taken alot of pics, Thank you Amazon it was the perfect price 4 the perfect wig!!!</li>
    <li> I am a first time wig user. I was looking for something cute and girly to cover up my Beiber hair cut while modeling girlier clothing at work. After looking at this wig for a week or two, I finally ordered it, along with a two pack of black hair nets and a foam head. (With no face! The faces freak me out!) When I first put this wig on, knowing NOTHING about them, I was a little disappointed. The color is VERY dark, I don&#x27;t see much brown in it at all. It was pretty poofy, I thought that maybe my head was too big for it which caused it to look funny on me. Like the others said, the bangs come SUPER long and kept bothering my eyes. I had planned on getting that part cut shorter. I was getting A LOT of hair out of it every time I touched it, so I was scared the whole thing might fall apart...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After watching some youtube videos of \\&quot;how to put on wigs\\&quot; I figured out I was wearing it wrong. Now when I put it on, I swoop the bangs to one side and they actually stay in place! I also started combing it with my cheap, yet decent, little combs instead of the \\&quot;wig brush\\&quot; I had been using. Now it&#x27;s not poofy, just pretty thick which is a good thing. I&#x27;ve also been pinning my real hair down with little clips before putting the hair net on. I still get a few hairs out every time I wear it, but nothing near the amount I had been getting. I think there might have been some loose hairs stuck in it that basically need to shed off. I don&#x27;t plan on cutting this now. It&#x27;s not the style shown (same wig, but the one in the pic has been trimmed) but I really like the way it looks. I could leave the house and go about anywhere and have people believing this was my real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been almost two weeks now. Still looking nice and once I figured all this wig stuff out, it&#x27;s been really easy to maintain. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet because I don&#x27;t wear it for very long, maybe an hour or two every few days. I comb it a bit every time I wear it. I really like this wig, and I would order it again. It arrived very fast, well packaged, and discreet (although it was no secret really, but I can understand why some people would want it that way!) The seller emailed me when they sent it out letting me know that instructions would come with it (they did). The seller seems very nice and business like. I&#x27;m not sure how they process returns, something I always like to find out first, but I don&#x27;t see myself ever wanting to send this back. I would recommend this to anyone looking for what I like to call \\&quot;the best of the cheapest\\&quot; wigs out there. I looked at some others that were hundreds of dollars, and didn&#x27;t look as nice. I can see this wig lasting me years. :).

    <li> My item shipped fast hair quality was ok. It got ratty quickly and didn&#x27;t have a shape in the bang when I first bought it. Plus it was a weird texture at first like barbie hair it just kept sliding out of my clips and my pony tail holders</li>
    <li> I received this wig super fast. It came in a tiny discrete package with no care instruction good thing im and avid wig wearer. The hair was so nice and shiny. I didnt have to cute it came just right for my face. It didnt last that long but I just put it in a bun still just as cute</li>
    <li> My order came in 2 days very quick....the wig is really nice and a great price i love the natural part great feature... The bangs are really long so you will have to cut them which i did myself and i also cut the length of the wig to shoulder length so it can fit my face better. I am happy with my order and I recommend this wig to anybody who wants a nice affordable wig with a bang! ...I took several pics different angles i will put them up so you can see the wig....</li>
    <li> Still my favorite wig to date! So trendy and smooth.  I even take a flatiron to it to freshen it up once in a while and it takes the heat perfectly.</li>
    <li> Very nice wig.  It was packaged very well and arrived ahead of projected delivery date.  I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Looks like real hair. My hair is really short. I pretty much have a mohawk and am in the growing out awkward stage. So this wig is great for everyday use and going out and having fun. I have not washed it, or styled it. The bangs are longer than the picture but i just sweep them to the side and that works just fine for me.</li>
    <li> recieved this wig today &amp;&amp;it&#x27;s awesome!.  fast shipping.  it&#x27;s my first wig.  i&#x27;m an extensions type person and wanted to try something new..  looks and feels real..  but just going to get it layered..  will order from this seller again:D</li>
    <li> This seller was very dilligent and checked in with me immediately to alert me they would be shipping the very next day I ordered.  The wig is super quality for the price and will be an excellent  addition to my geisha Halloween costume.  I see wigs that cost 40 dollars at Halloween stores that are horrible quality compared to this great catch. The hair texture is soft and workable  not tangled at all. The only thing I will say is that the wig does look more Black than Brown-Black, but this is the look I was going for!!!  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> the wig didn&#x27;t look like the picture at all  not satisfied with the customer service  not buying from this company again</li>
    <li> I loved this; when I first seen it on here. I looked at it on the pictures &amp; i fell in love. Then afterwards I ordered it.. it said it was going to come in the next 4 days or so&amp; instead it came 2days later. I really enjoyed it; it comes in a small little package that has a pink &#x27;Care instruction letter&#x27;&#x27; &amp; it comes also in a plastic see-thru packet. When I first opened it the bangs were long and the hair felt sooooo, soft. I still wear it every single day. Its not the type of wig that gets tangled &amp;  you can&#x27;t wear it anymore. No its wayyyyy better! LOLL its amazing. Even after you curl it; flat iron it never looses its softness. I also washed the wig with my shampoo. I didnt look for a wig shampoo; so i just decided to do it with regular shampoo&#x27;s and it made it smell really good. :) I really love it.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty cool in the picture. But really the bangs are curled under and are SUPER thick! as with the rest of the wig. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Wow! I bought this wig for my mom who recently lost all her beautiful knee-length (!!) hair to chemotherapy. We were going to buy her one of those expensive monofilament wigs made for cancer patients because we wanted something that looked real and was comfortable for a bald head. But because I stumbled upon this wig on Amazon and it was on sale through a different seller for $19.99, we decided what the heck, let&#x27;s try it. It was the exact style she wanted and all the reviews were raving so we gave it a shot, for a temporary wig until we could buy her \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; that&#x27;s $200 plus. OMG, are we glad we gave this a shot! She loves it so much, she had me order another one - exactly the same - in case they discontinue it or in case something happens to the first one! We will not be buying a more expensive monofilament wig as this one is perfect! Everyone raves about how this looks so real and frames her face so nicely. She said it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable to wear all day long by itself, but she now has a wig cap (panty hose like material) that she wears under it and it&#x27;s not so uncomfortable against her skin for long periods of time now. The adjustable strap inside helps to keep it in place and she also reinforces it with bobby pins against the wig cap. The bangs were too long but nothing a pair of scissors couldn&#x27;t fix! Better to have them longer and customizable for each person than too short. She loves this wig so much, it has given her a new outlook and makes her feel \\&quot;like a woman again\\&quot;. :) I can&#x27;t say enough about this wig! Nor can people who see her in it, everyone else loves it too! it&#x27;s more black than brown black, as other reviewers have said, but she&#x27;s asian and always had jet black hair anyway, so it&#x27;s perfect for her. i&#x27;ll post some photos if i can figure out how.</li>
    <li> Very Satisfied with quality of hollywood wigs. Took it to a hair stylist for cutting and curling iron treatment. Really looks good.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this wig. It looks great on her! You&#x27;d really think it cost more by how nice it looks.</li>
    <li> This wig was OK. Before I bought it I would&#x27;ve liked to know that the wig was heavy and how itchy it was. The bangs and hair length were way too long so I had to trim it down so it would look more natural. Sometimes the adjusting straps will randomly come undone so it is hanging down for everyone to see. I don&#x27;t wear this wig anymore I just decided to wear my natural hair since the wig was so annoying. Also I was not informed about the $10.00 shipping until I had my heart set on it and really wanted to have it.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone and I would not buy it again. It was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> i have naturally curly hair so it was nice to play with this straight look for awhile.  the wig is well made and is a really good quality.</li>
    <li> This was the first time a used a wig. Is very good quality a very dark brown. Length is exactly as it shows it come with a weave cap. I bought a wig cap. It had straps under wig to make it tighter onto your head. The bangs are pretty long so will probably need to cut them. I will definitely use it over and over again. 1 more thing a brushed it and the hair did not fall off. People taught it was my real hair .</li>
    <li> The wig came just as shown.  It is of very good quality.  We use it for role playing during sex and it works great.  Bangs need to be trimmed on wearer however</li>
    <li> I purchased this wig and received it in 3 days and I can honestly say that the bang is full and pretty but the wig overall is horrible.The wig looks nothing like the picture, it&#x27;s very bulky and thick and has the worst synthetic texture.Also, the wig is made too small and you have to keep pulling it down on your head to fit correctly and I will never buy this item again.</li>
