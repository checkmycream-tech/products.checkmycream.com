<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I first started using this product, I was not impressed. My hair was not soft like I thought it would be but man! I take back my words abour not being impressed! I have used this product four times and my hair loves it! The softness of my hair that has begun to develop over the past 6 weekds because of the continued use of this hair mask is GREAT! It has taught me that beautiful hair deserves tender love and care and this product has poured its love on my hair!</li>
    <li> One of the BEST!! I would recommend it to anyone. Brings your hair back to life.</li>
    <li> My hair likes this stuff! I used the product in conjuction with my steamer and my hair was very soft and moisturized..I am on my 2nd bottle</li>
    <li> I have been natural for about two years and was looking for a conditioner that would work well in my hair. I have been following the creator of this product for quite some time and preordered as soon as this conditioner was made available. It is the best conditioner that I have used in my hair; making my hair easier to tangle and maintain. My curls have even been more defined with the use of this product. I have  recommended this product as well as the others put out by the creator and will continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;I love it so much that I have started to use it in my 3yr old daughters hair. I will definitely be ordering more and hope that it will soon be made in a bigger bottle!</li>
    <li> As the title states, this IS the new creamy crack! I&#x27;ve been following @courtneynaturalhair on Instagram since about January of this year. I&#x27;ve been seeing her posts and updates about these products before they were even released back in March and I was a believer before I even tried it. You should SEE this woman&#x27;s beautiful hair! It&#x27;s natural and ALL hers! She said her secret was her very own product, so I ordered it immediately after I was able to afford it. I LOVE THIS STUFF. I just shampooed my hair and put this in and sat under my dryer for 15 min. By the time I rinsed it out, my hair was super soft and my curls did whatever I told them to. I&#x27;m using it religiously every week and I would LOVE to try the other products Courtney has out. I&#x27;m a recent Cosmo school grad and money is crazy tight right now so I haven&#x27;t been able to purchase the butter or the newly released vitamins yet, but in due time!! BUY THIS PRODUCT!!&lt;br /&gt;-Arielle W.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and the hair butter offered on the website, after completing my transition from having regular relaxers/perms track to being natural. I saw all of the reviews and the creators own experience with the product and had nothing to lose, after all I just did the big chop. My family members (both female and male) are the biggest critics of natural hair, even after I introduced them to the line and watched the video available on the site numerous times with them they were still skeptical. So when I say the proof is in the pudding the proof is in the pudding it is! After one treatment of the Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Condition Mask, we (my family and I) saw amazing results. My &#x27;knotty hair&amp;#34; as my family refers to it, was now soft, manageable curls. Not only dose my hair look and feel amazing my scalp feels heathy too. My natural and even my relaxed/permed family and friends can&#x27;t get enough of the product and still cant believe the results! Thank you so much for sharing your natural hair are secret. Best product in the history of products on the market! I recommend this line to every hair type and state (natural, transitioning, relaxed, in between, and it has a mind of its own!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember this is a deep conditioning mask, it&#x27;s not to be used everyday, and is recommended to be used every 2 weeks. For best results follow all instruction, recommendations and if you&#x27;re on social media and networking look up The Mane Choice for customers reviews also check out the website.... The Mane Choice is my main choice when it comes to hair care!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait for the rest of the line to be released, congratulations on the success and may it  continue !

    <li> I have just recently started taking care of my hair like I should have all these years, and when \\&quot;CourtneyNaturalHair\\&quot; announced that she was coming out with a hair line I knew it would be the best. I mean, just look at her hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other DC before, but none of them made my hair feel or look the way this one does. Other DC&#x27;s just kind of sit on my hair and have so much slip to it, but this product doesn&#x27;t. Keep in mind, that just because it doesn&#x27;t have slip doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not working. It definitely works! And a little goes a long way too. After about 30 mins under a plastic cap and some applied heat, my hair feels fresh and is beyond manageable. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and my hair is already looking and feeling healthier than before! This will definitely be a staple product for me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thoroughly delighted to have finally gotten these products in the mail. Shipping was very quick and the products are very affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep conditioner is amazing. After just one treatment, I had less frizz and it was more soft and manageable. This product was made with quality ingredients and it shows with the results you get from each treatment! The butter left my hair soo moisturized after my twist out that I didn&#x27;t have to retwist the following night. The curl definition is incredible as well. Both items have become stables of mine. Please give both a try, you and your hair won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> I decided to go natural last year after the breakage I suffered through relaxers and illness. I had surgery in December of 2012 which lead to horrible breakage for me. After trying multiple inferior natural hair products, The Mane Choice has become a life saver. I no longer have breakage and have seen substantial growth. My curls are softer, fuller and much shiner than ever. I&#x27;ve never had such healthy hair in my life. Thank you The Mane Choice you saved me from a life of wigs and weaves!! Natural girls rock!!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair super soft and manageable. Smells absolutely amazing!</li>
    <li> Hated it made my hair dry and fall out I tried many deep conditioners but I can say this was the worst  one</li>
    <li> For a long time, I&#x27;ve had this idea of what ingredients I wanted to see in a product, the benefits it offered, and the results it would produce.  As soon as I saw the potential in this deep mask I knew it would be the one.  For the quality ingredients and what it offers, it is well worth the money.  My curls were so soft and silky when I rinsed under the sink.  I wasn&#x27;t happy with the deep conditioners on the market and/or the prices attached to them, that I would rarely deep condition due to the fact I knew it wasn&#x27;t doing much for my hair.  This deep mask is definitely a staple. I look forward to using it every time.  Every 2 weeks is torture!  But well worth the wait.</li>
    <li> This is a well thought out product, from packaging to ingredients.  I love the results after using the conditioning mask.  It left my hair feeling thoroughly clean and revitalized.  I highly recommend this as well as Mane Choice other products.  Thank you for a great experience and the goodies inside the box (you have to order to find out about the freebies)!</li>
    <li> The deep conditioning product is great! My hair feels soft and I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times so far on the every 2 week regimen. I can feel a difference in my hair already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this - it&#x27;s making my hair shinny, smooth, amazing looking. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because just the thought of getting it out of the bottle makes me want to give up putting it on. The consistency of the product is meant for a jar, not a bottle. I have to keep shaking it to get the product out (not fun for an arthritic arm) whereas if it came in a jar, I would just need to scoop it out.  Please put the product in a jar.</li>
    <li> So far I am pleased with hair products.  Have only used them a couple of times,</li>
    <li> Love this conditional have about it before and it is good for hair breakage will purchase it again</li>
    <li> Though I try not to spend too much on hair products I decided to splurge on this deep conditioner and it did not fail to disappoint. There is no slip--but I was not looking for that in a deep conditioner, as I wash and detangle my hair before I deep condition it. The consistency isn&#x27;t thick but a little goes a long way. I applied it with heat for 30 minutes and OMG my hair was amazingly soft for the rest of the week and my 3c curls were absolutely popping! Love this stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the hype about this.  There is very little slip and i saw no noticeable difference when used.  My hair is 3c, coarse and thick.</li>
    <li> Great product....leaves hair feeling stronger and it smells nice to...LOL</li>
    <li> I bought this product specifically for my 9yr old daughter. She has 4c hair and she also has, eczema that had gotten extremely bad when she was about 7 and contributed to her already dry hair which caused it to break off terribly. I was very ignorant to caring for natural hair, and would flat iron her hair, and press it, and just literally BURN IT UP! So I started to do research on natural hair, and found out she was 4c, what kind of protective styles to do, and how many times I need to deep condition her hair. I don&#x27;t remember how I stumbled across this product, but I am so GLAD I did. Before using this product, after washing my daughters hair it was almost impossible to comb through. NOW her hair is sooooo much more manageable, it does not break off, it is even beginning to look like the texture is changing. She is 9yrs old and SHE can even tell the difference. I am so satisfied with this product, I will buy it FOREVER! Initially I had only bought it for her because I was tired of the breakage and was desperate for SOMETHING, but next time I will purchase 3 bottles, 1 for her, 1 for my youngest daughter (who is 6 with 3c hair), and 1 for me (relaxed hair) I am looking forward to any future products from this particular line.</li>
    <li> I ordered this when I ordered the &amp;#34;Butter&amp;#34;.  I love this product.  I use it with a plastic cap for about an hour and then rinse,  I apply the &amp;#34;Butter&amp;#34; to my damp hair. flat twist and roll the ends.  My hair comes out curly and soft.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for healthy, happy hair</li>
    <li> I love the product - people have said that it worked wonders with their hair, but for me it&#x27;s too early to tell - I only use it once and you&#x27;re supposed to use it once a month. Will give an update around September or October.</li>
    <li> I Love the hair growth vitamins, but I was not really impressed with the conditioner.  It is watery and did not leave my permed hair feeling luxurious as others have added in their reviews.</li>
    <li> These products came highly recommended and so I bought them... Thy feel good on my hair but can&#x27;t speak to effectiveness just yet...</li>
    <li> Not the greatest detangler, but I&#x27;ve noticed decreased shedding with this product. I will keep it in rotation with my moisturizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about buying a hair product offline but being that I follow them on social media and saw that they had such great reviews I had to give it a try. ONE WORD:  AMAZING ! I purchased the vitamins and conditioner and started seeing results in about 3 months. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with length but shedding was a big problem or should I say breakage. Either way those vitamins and this conditioner turned my life around and I&#x27;m never looking back lol. I&#x27;m just a regular person like you. I&#x27;m not being paid to say this or anything.. I just want to help someone like someone helped me.</li>
    <li> So this is one of my favorites deep conditioner I deep condition once a week and have felt a difference in my hair since day one I also use it in conjunction with the mane choice vitamins and the two work together like a power couple !!! trust me these products won&#x27;t let you down</li>
    <li> Definitely love this deep conditioner! I definitely love wash days and compare all of my deep conditioners to this one. I had very little breakage after just one use, detangling was a breeze, and the smell is heavenly. Thanks so much for making a wonderful product!!</li>
    <li> So I am a self proclaimed PRODUCT JUNKIE! However, I always come back to this goodie! After falling in love with the Manetabolism hair vitamins I went ahead and not only re-uped on my stash but I also tried this. I love the quality natural ingredients and how soft it leaves my hair feeling! I must admit I have to use this sparingly so that I do not run out of it!</li>
    <li> I just started using this product!! &amp; I love it so much!!!!! My hair is much softer!</li>
    <li> I borrowed this deep conditioner from my sister in law &amp; I must stay I love it I&#x27;ve seen a big difference in my hair since using it</li>
    <li> after using this deep conditioning mask, my hair felt like butter ! i used as instructed with a hooded dryer and achieved the softness, manageability, and definition i was hoping for. I&#x27;m so glad i made the purchase and I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying this and I love it there is so much slip to this DC  it&#x27;s so good for detangling and it makes my hair so soft I love it when</li>
    <li> I am now a life time customer of The Mane Choice.  I have been using this conditioner for over a year. From the very first use, my hair is a lot softer and more manageable. It has great slip and makes it easy to detangle. It is a staple in my suit case and at home!  I&#x27;ve made the mane choice!!!</li>
    <li> This Product Has Worked Wonders On My Hair. Because Of Your Wonderful Products My Once Thin Hair Is Getting Back To Being Thick, Thanks For Everything !!!</li>
    <li> I use this product on both myself, and my 5 yr old daughter. Before using this product, I literally had to fight her in order to detangle her hair. Now it is smooth sailing on wash days. Thank you Courtney for sharing your product with the world. It has made our household peaceful on Sunday nights.</li>
    <li> The condition has great slip and moisturizers the hair shaft from root to tip, great product!</li>
    <li> I like this product but I do not love it like I do the vitamins. It does not do much more to my hair than a regular conditioner. It does work better if you sit under a dryer or steamer. It is a good product but not great for my hair that is. In natural hair you really learn different things work for different people.</li>
    <li> Great product. Had amazing slip. My hair feels amazing after washing It</li>
    <li> This product definitely deserves a 5 stars! When you apply this mask to your hair It feels so nice and smeels really good. After rincing it out you will get the softest hair ever its amazing ! Go and try it you won&#x27;t regret !</li>
    <li> This deron ci ditto net revived my dry hair. I live in NJ and whne the weather changed my hair immediately got dry and looked life-less. I tried a bunch of other things and decided to try The Mane Choice after seeing one of my instagram friends rave about it. After just one treatment my hair was soft, shiny and my curls popped! I will be ordering more very soon. It&#x27;s an instant staple product for me.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to anyone seeking soft manageable healthy hair. This product is amazing.  My hair loves it &amp; so do I. Its a staple in my hair care regimen. I use it wkly and my hair is softer, more manageable,  and sheds less. This deep conditioner combined with the amazing  manetabolism  hair vitamins and hair butter is the perfect combo. If I could I would give it 10 ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST DEEP CONDITIONER I HAVE USED ON MY HAIR! I big chopped about 5 months ago  and this is definitely a necessity that I use in my hair regimen. Makes your hair super soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> This review is from: Manetabolism Healthy Hair Vitamin (30 day supply) (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product on instagram and i did a alot of research on it. And when I say every review I read was nothing but positivity!. I ordered a 2 month supply last thursday and recieved them on the following monday. And I started taking the pills the very same day. So fastword a week laster and I can alreaduy see a change in my hair. It feels and looks healthier and it is now retaing alot of moisture. It really is living up to all the hype. I cant wait until I am finish with both bottles and order more.</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I use this in my hair all the time and my hair loves it, its never looked so healthy, its a must buy! Ladies!</li>
    <li> The Mane Choice products are some of the worst products out there for 4 type hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure I believe all of the 5 star ratings out there on The Mane Choice products. I purchased the expensive Thermal Defense five piece system and these products are no better than some of the no name brands at the Dollar Store. After using these products, my hair was greasy, puffy, brittle and unmanageable. As well, the company has a no return policy on their products. I have never purchased anything I could not return. Never trust a company that will not allow you to return a product that doesn&#x27;t work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your hard earn money on these products.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product is amazing ! I bought it some time last year and I still have it :D. Although its a small bottle you only need&lt;br /&gt;A DIME SIZE AMOUNT (every two weeks). TRUST me only a dime lol, its amazing !!!!!!!!! This is a must have.. Think I&#x27;ll order more very soon. :)</li>
    <li> trying this product for the very first time update you later</li>
    <li> This right here is the best thing on earth. It leaves my hair feeling light and soft, it smells amazing. I will continue to buy this product and treat my hair the way it&#x27;s supposed to be treated. Thank you Courtney for putting this together for us. My journey to transitioning has also started!! NO MORE PERMS FOR ME!!!</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product after the success of the Vitamins &amp; the Sweet Almond Oil that I had bought from Manechoice. This DC is amazing! It smells great, it leaves my hair feeling extremely conditioned and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down much at all either! It is made with all natural ingredients so you KNOW it can work wonders for natural hair! I recommend anyone to try this product!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I first used it after a weekend in Galveston Beach going from nasty gulf water to chlorine water. When I got home and first used it I loved how nourished my hair felt afterwards. After continued used I&#x27;ve noticed less shedding and MY CURLS HAVE REURNED. I thought I had heated damaged hair but my curls have returned with consistent usage!!</li>
    <li> Another product that I absolutely love and can&#x27;t live without. This product does exactly what it says it does, deep conditions. I have to buy 2 bottles at a tine because my mother likes to use my products lol. It also makes my scalp tingle with joy!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is extraordinary!! Mane choice is the BEST choice! My hair has grown so much and has gotten so full and thick since using these products! I shed less and my hair is stronger than ever before!! Love it Love it Love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! I used this before I cut my hair and it smells amazing. It makes my hair so easy to manage and it can notice the difference after one use. Its definitely one of my top favorite deep conditioners! I recommended it to my sisters and my mother who have natural and relaxed hair. It works great on all our textures. You gotta buy it!</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner strengthened my hair so much! I love the way ot smells and you dont need to usd too much either. I use this every times I was which is every two weeks and I am never left dissapointed. My hair feels so soft and strong after every use. This deep conditioner also helps with breakage.  I reccomend this product to anyone who is serious about haircare, wants string strong and healthy hair and has problems with breakage.  This deep comditioner and the vitamins are AWESOME!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, but have read great reviews about it. I plan to order it soon. I look forward to great healthy hair recovery....</li>
    <li> I love the tingly feeling and the smell is terrific! It makes my hair even softer and detangles so much easier! I think I have found my conditioner...It&#x27;s a winner!!</li>
    <li> Worst ever for my hair.  This product made my hair so hard and dry.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Make sure you strand test first.  Now I have to spend time nurturing my curls back to feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> DC are my favorite part of my wash days so my DC must be on point. Well this my friends is the truth. It does wonders for my hair, my curls are so defined and my hair is extremely soft. Please keep making this product I can&#x27;t live without it!!!!!</li>
    <li> This gives my hair life! I need anther bottle because I ran out. This deep conditioner makes my hair soft and shiny. The shedding I get is so little with this product. My hair SHEDS like a cat lol but this really helps. This is my staple !</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I&#x27;m on my second bottle so far and this deep conditioner is one of best I&#x27;ve tried. My hair has shine and looks much thicker and healthier! I use on a weekly basis, deep conditioning under a heated bonnet and the results are amazing! I follow the owner of the company on Instagram, which is how I found out about their products. This is only one of several that I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I ordered this conditioner during the Labor Day sale at themanechoice.com. I&#x27;m already a fan of the vitamin supplement Manetabolism and decided to give another product by the Mane Choice a try. I noticed a difference after the first use. My hair was incredibly soft and full of body. I have a relaxer and noticed less shedding the next time I washed my hair and conditioned it with the green tea and carrot deep conditioner. I also noticed less dandruff as the green tea is soothing to the scalp. I&#x27;ve become addicted to the products made by the Mane Choice because quite frankly THEY WORK!</li>
    <li> This product is amazzzzzzing! Omg! My curls come to life EVERYTIME I deep condition my hair! I&#x27;ve tried so many deep conditioners and this one blows them all out of the water! My curls are always so soft and defined after I use this! I will continue to order this over and over again!!! Ahhhh</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love in love in love with this product! My hair is very easy to become damaged and I worship these products !</li>
    <li> I love the green tea carrot deep condition. I&#x27;m starting to see results and I love the way it makes my hair feels. For a person with thick natural hair,this is a wonderful product to use.</li>
    <li> What a small bottle of magic. My only wish is that it was bigger. Definitely a wonderful conditioner. It makes your hair feel soft and helps with the tangles.</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is amazing! It leaves my hair so soft and moisturized. It also has great ingredients one of them is biotin which you find in hair pills to help your hair grow. A little goes along way with this condtioner. This is one of my staples and I will keep ordering</li>
    <li> If your curls are dry and you are looking for something to revive and moisturize your hair, look no further than this! This deep conditioner did just what it says it will do and has became a staple product for me. In just one use my curls were popping, moisturized, and strengthened! Best deep conditioner in the game right now.,</li>

    <li> I truly love this deep conditioning mask and I use it every 2 weeks to deep condition my hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft and does not strip my hair off moisture.</li>
    <li> Recommend over any other condition, it is the absolutely bestttt!!!! Not only this, but all other products associated with The Mane Choice! I follow all social networks associated with them &amp; do my research before purchasing anything. They&#x27;re so many perfect reviews of their products it&#x27;s ridiculous! I love The Mane Choice!

    <li> I love love love this product. I use it on mine and my daughters natural hair and love how it makes the hair feel.</li>
    <li> The BEST deep conditioner on the market! This conditioner made my hair very soft and manageable. My hair was &amp;#34;super&amp;#34; moisturized! A little goes a long way! The shipping was fast also!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my deep conditioner for about 3 months now and I LOVE IT. My hair breaks so easily and I&#x27;ve had the hardest time growing it out since I was in high school. This product has help aid in the regrowth of my hair since I finally made the decision to cut all my hair off at the end of June. It leaves my hair so soft and I&#x27;ve actually been able to retain the length of my hair and then some! My hair has grown around 5 inches since I&#x27;ve started using The Mane Choice products. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just want to say I love this product. I have been natural my whole life, but I have been flat ironing my hair my whole life or as long as I can remember. My friend suggested this mask to help with my heat damage and color. I love this product I see a complete change in my hair. The most important thing with natural hair is to keep it moisture and this product does that. I would love to try here other products but for my introduction product this is the best hands down .Well worth every dime.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets much better than this conditioner. It has definitely improved the strength of my hair! Smells great and provides me with great slip. Definitely a must have Ave worth every penny!!!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair really soft and moisturised , i am taking it along side with the vitamins, still on my first month, i use it after every 2 weeks. can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I had over processed hair because of color and heat damage and this product brought my natural curls back! I am so thankful for this conditioner. I am a life-time customer of the ManeChoice!</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Leaves your hair smelling good and maintainable.</li>

Yes, this product is so good that it can&#x27;t be explained. It feels good and the smell is very refreshing to me! It travels deep within your roots and it just works magic within your scalp.

    <li> Leave your hair feeling rejuvenated! I recommend this product natural or relaxed !</li>
    <li> This deep condition is great. It makes my hair soooooo soft. Follow the directions and you will love it! TRY IT!</li>
    <li> I really like this deep conditioner. I have alot of hair, and this one bottle is very efficient for at least 3 deep conditions. This conditioner had alot of slip and leaves my hair feeling moisiturized.</li>
    <li> This was the first product of the entire Mane Choice Solutions hair line to be released. I wanted to try some so badly, but was a broke college student. But then I won a bottle in a giveaway! It took me a while to figure out how it was best used for my hair, but as soon as I got it down, I was ready to purchase a new bottle. This stuff makes my hair feel sooooo soft. I wouldn&#x27;t dare leave this out of my hair regimen.</li>
    <li> Only use this product a couple of times but can already see the difference in the condition of my hair already</li>
    <li> THIS IS TRUE LOVEEEE IN A BOTTLE !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a love and hate relationship with my hair (more so hate because I wasn&#x27;t good at doing it). My mom&#x27;s a hair stylist and before college she used to always do my hair and I never truly learned before going to college. The first semester was terrible (Hair wise) I was relatively new to going natural and didn&#x27;t know how to manage it well and which products were good for me or not. So every month I went home my mom always ended up cutting my ends because it was unhealthy every time I tried doing it T_T. Still haven&#x27;t lost hope I researched more products to use. I came across the Mane Choice site and checked out the products. Shopping on the Mane Choice made shopping for natural hair made EASY. One of the many products I came across was the deep conditioning mask which I use about 1 or twice a month and I always looked forward to always doing my hair than dreading it. With more use of the product managing my hair became 100X more Easier ! A great deep conditioner like this makes combing WAYYY much easier and your hair feeling amazingly Soft !! I am so happy that I discovered this product and have been a consistent customer buyer ever SINCE. I can guarantee if you are having trouble with conditioning your hair and managing it this deep conditioning mask is the way to GO !</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  My daughter told me about this deep conditioner and said I have to try it.  Since I purchased it, I have used this for several months and I absolutely love it.  It makes may hair feel really clean and smells fantastic.  It has done wonders for my hair.  I highly recommend using this product in your hair-washing regimen.</li>
    <li> I love manechoice from the pills to the hair products...my hair never looked so good...keep up the good work</li>
    <li> This is  a good  product. Second  best to  the butter probably. It&#x27;s lightweight and does its  job.  Leaves my hair  feeling good. If I was to complain about something it would be that I need a bigger bottle. I feel like I only use it once and I&#x27;m wondering where is the rest lol. I  just  think I use too much. But this deep conditioner  definitely  gives me life. That&#x27;s  why I have 3 bottles on my dresser at the moment. Love it!</li>
    <li> I  believe it until I tried it for my self. Nothing made my hair more manageable and soft than this this green tea &amp; carrot deep conditioner. I was able to comb through my natural hair which is a plus for me. I also have color on my hair which I feel that this conditioner is helping my hair from color breakage and damage. So thankful I ran into this product line.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for almost two years but only had been wearing sew in&#x27;s, since August I have embraced my own hair and started wearing it! I have used this conditioner and can say this is the reason I can wear it natural my hair is much more managable and soft is an understatement!!! I recommend this to everyone as well as the vitamins!! I have got three of my friends started, just by them looking at my hair!!! Seeing is believing!!! 5 stars from me!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered the Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Conditioning Mask and the vitamins during the ManeChoice Black Friday sale.  I waited until I finished another deep conditioner that I was using so that I can be able to tell the results (I&#x27;m some what of a product junkie)!!!  OMG...my hair absolutely loved this conditioner!!! It is extremely hydrating and left my hair soft and manageable. A little goes a long way...trust me!  I used this as my deep conditioner every two weeks and I actually just ran out earlier this month.  I must admit I was a little skeptical about how it would smell in my hair.  Well much to my amazement it smelled wonderful and not like carrots at all.  My co-workers have been complimenting me on my hair and the way it smells. Mrs. Courtney definitely did an excellent job when she created this conditioner!!! I definitely will be reordering in the near future!! Thanks Courtney for this masterpiece!!!</li>
    <li> I do like this deep conditioner. I first purchased with the vitamins and the hair Butter. I can&#x27;t RAVE enough about the vitamins and butter but the conditioning mask is in a league of its own. It doesn&#x27;t take much and it gets the job done. Results vary based on hair type but results are always mixed with &amp;#34;ooh&amp;#34; &amp;#34;aahhh&amp;#34; &amp;#34;yayyy&amp;#34; :-) The Mane Choice did it again when they made this product. they really know hair and for that I&#x27;m grateful!</li>
    <li> MIRACLE IN A BOTTLE, i could yell it off the rooftop. This brings my dull, lifeless hair to life. I use every 2 weeks seeing that it is an intense conditioner, and everytime my strands feel so much healthier and stronger not to mention the softness and sheen. Just amazing</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to replace my deep conditioner and i haven&#x27;t went back since! I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I received this package over a month ago and I wanted to use it a couple of times before I gave it a review. I have a combination of 3c &amp; various degrees of 4s on my head &amp; completely natural all around. 1st time I used it as directed without heat and it was Ok, not great. 2nd time I used as directed &amp; added Argon oil with heat &amp; it was GREAT. I think the heat made a different for my hair.  This is a staple in my regime now.</li>
    <li> Purchasing the deep conditioner was the best decision. My hair tends to be dry and difficult to deal with but this stuff made my hair feel so soft. I deep condition for about 2 hours and sometimes overnight and my hair (Blossom) was so easy to manage and detangle. I also like that the scent is very light and doesn&#x27;t have a lingering smell. If you have not tried this product then you are missing out. LOVE! LOVE! And I WILL be repurchasing it.</li>
    <li> When I first started my natural journey I tried every product out there that other Naturalist were saying worked wonders on their hair, you will be amazed! so I tried them all and they all failed my hair. I started feeling like giving up and going back to Perming my hair. Thats when I started following The Mane Choice and saw the creator was just one of us. she showed her hair journye, took the time out to explain the product and the benefits of it. I gave it a try and was truly amazed at the results. I thought ok maybe the first time was a fluke but after the second use I was convinced. Now I can not wait to do my deep conditioning I look forward to the day and actually count down. My hair loves it. BUY this you will not be sorry. everyone that I told about it and bought it loves it too. you will not be disappointed</li>
    <li> My hair was lifeless no bounce, shedding, and dry. My frustration ended once my hair experience The Mane Choice overhaul. This DC makes love to my hair because the end results are amazing!!! My hair has life with a whole lot of body and moisture. My shedding is minimum plus I have gain fullness and length. I would not Hesitate to purchase this DC.</li>
    <li> Purchased this along with the DOESN&#x27;T GET NO BUTTER THAN THIS and I love them both.  The way my hair felt and looked after the deep Condition was awesome.  I kept it in for a hr. Thanks a bunch.  Keep making a great product.</li>
    <li> This conditioning mask is literal magic! After just one wash, my hair felt so much softer than what it normally is. My hair is also more easier to manage and it&#x27;s not as damaged as it was before. Use this product once every two weeks and you&#x27;ll have healthier, stronger hair. My hair is so much better because of this. The creator of these products is a genius!</li>
    <li> WOW! I purchased this about a month ago for my hair that lacks so much hydration and mote! I love it. After using it once my curl pattern changed and my hair became more soft and visually healthy! I even used it on my boyfriends hair and he loves it!</li>
    <li> this product would just leave my hair so soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> This conditioner is AMAZING!!! In addition to taking the vitamins, I also use this conditioner. After sitting under the dryer &amp; rinsing it out, my hair is so manageable, easy to comb through &amp; feel soooooo good!!! It also helped to stop the shedding I was experiencing from all the medications I was on. I have 2 bottles that I use on a regular basis &amp; I refuse to use any other deep conditioner because I believe if it works, why switch it up?</li>
    <li> Applying this product is very easy and smooth!  My hair feels silky and healthy during and after the process. Only personally, I&#x27;m not into the scent.</li>
    <li> All of the Mane choice products are amazing, but this one is my all time fave it left my hair soft and very manageable. A must buy for natural or relaxed ladies.</li>
    <li> A friend bought this for me as a gift. This conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft, moisturized and CLEAN!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is AWESOME!! Once I let it sit and marinate in my hair and rinsed it out, my hair was so soft and detagnled easily. It helps your hair grow and keeps it well moisturized. I&#x27;ve used it on my transitioning hair and my permed hair, it works great either way. One bottle will last you a while.</li>
    <li> After using this my hair just feels completely different! It&#x27;s so soft and well moisturized. I love that the ingredients are organic so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m putting s lot of junk in my hair to mask it&#x27;s true state. This helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this deep conditioner. The ingredients in this little bottle does my 4c hair wonders. Great for hair health. I don&#x27;t use as often as I should but the times I do use it I feel a difference. Lots of moisture and shine!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love the Green tea &amp; carrot deep conditioner by The Mane Choice. I currently use it alongside the hair butter &amp; vitamins daily. The texture of my hair is fine &amp; since using above products my hair has thickened up as well as grew longer. I am a very satisfied customer and have recommended these products to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in loveeee with this stuff. When you use the whole line of products you see much better results. My hair hasn&#x27;t been so thick or healthy in my life</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing how awesome it has been for Courtney the creators hair!!! She has created an impeccable product!!! Before using it, my hair was a little dry, shedding and brittle in some spots. It is very potent and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of product which is also good because your product last longer while still giving effective results! I let it sit in my hair as directed and the results, even after the first use were amazing!!! My hair was softer, more manageable and looked better over all!!! I will keep using it and I am looking forward to how much more healthier my hair will become over time!  The Mane Choices entire line of products are impeccable and of everything I&#x27;ve tried,  I have not tried anything more effective! I am looking forward to trying her heat styling line of products next and I am certain that those in addition to the deep conditioning mask and the hair vitamins, will to be staples in my collection of natural hair products!! Since trying her deep conditioner, I can confidently and with NO hesitation PITCH my other deep conditioning products! Before this bottle is complete, I will be ordering more. It is reasonably priced as well. I love how The Mane choice paves the way for healthy natural hair care that is effective and affordable! Keep up the great work and keep these awesome products coming Courtney!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple of months ago and I love the smell and how my hair feels afterwards. My hair is soft and easy to detangle after using it.</li>
    <li> This is an AMAZING product. I received it as a gift along with the pills, and every since then I&#x27;ve loved it! This is the best conditioner that I have used. It gives my hair the perfect moisture and look after I use it! I will recommend this product to anyone, and I&#x27;ll continue to buy this product until I can&#x27;t anymore!</li>
    <li> My hair was soooo soft</li>
    <li> This conditioner is really awesome for strengthening the hair! It doesn&#x27;t have a ton of slip, but you&#x27;ll definitely feel and see the difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner! The first time I tried it, I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would work for me because the conditioner wasn&#x27;t as thick as I expected.  Thankfully I was wrong! It&#x27;s amazing! It moisturizes and strengthens my hair making it noticeably softer and easier to manage. It&#x27;s packed with ingredients that have been shown to dramatically improve the health of your hair. I love it and will be ordering another bottle soon.</li>
    <li> This amazing bottle rich in natural ingredients is the bomb.com for hair&#x27;s health &amp; beyond.

Woop woop !Your hair will start having an affair forever with Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Conditioning Mask . I need to win the lottery to stack on mane choices products</li>
    <li> This is an absolute AMAZING deep conditioner by Manetabolism! !</li>
    <li> I know there are a lot of great reviews for this product but I personally did not like it on my hair. It somehow got rid of my natural curls. Normally when I get out of the shower after washing my hair, my curls are visible but with this product it didn&#x27;t do that. It just didn&#x27;t work well for me. My hair often felt dry.. like it wasn&#x27;t nourished. In it&#x27;s defense, I think I only used it 2-3 times.. but to me that&#x27;s enough time to see a positive difference.. but the difference I saw was negative.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It made my hair feel do soft.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I use it weekly and it keeps my hair healthy, soft and strong!!!</li>
    <li> After already using the hair vitamins, i figured i&#x27;d go ahead and try all the products offered by manechoice. This is the absolute best deep conditioning mask ever. All of Courtney&#x27;s products are great, and I will never use any other deep conditioner again. After using this once, my hair was sooooo soft and manageable. Having hair that i can manage is extremely important to me since i am a natural 4c sista. I cant wait to order another bottle of this. Follow them on instagram to see great results @themanechoice</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner!!!! All natural ingredients!!! Have to get u some. Shipped on time or sooner!! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> Love it I use it every week less shedding hair growing like crazy!! thanks for the boost!!!!</li>
    <li> The BEST deep conditioning mask I have ever used. I tried the deep conditioning mask and fell in love at first sight! After using it, my hair was very soft, manageable and felt great. I love the fact that you do not have to use a lot of product to get great result. I would recommend this product to anybody. One step closer to healthier hair. Thanks for creating wonderful products!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioner out there and in my holy grail category.  It turns my hair 4 b/c hair into butter.  I use it almost after every shampoo either under a hair bonnet dryer for 20 minutes or just under a plastic cap for an hour.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come in a larger bottle with a pump.  It&#x27;s too hard to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a while now. This is by far the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used on my 4c hair. Not only my hair goes out smelling great it feel very soft which is a great plus for me. Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product..... I will be restocking and I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle only because I don&#x27;t want to have a chance of running out and having to wait. Lol but I love the way my hair feels after. I&#x27;m pregnant right now but after next month I plan on chopping my heat damage and ordering my vitamins. I can&#x27;t wait to see the growth I get from that. 5 stars from me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- @msdiamond_bafd</li>
    <li> The Mane Choice is the best product for growing my hair! I have used many products before and this by far the best! The green tea and carrot deep conditioner is absolutely amazing! It has definitely made a major difference in detangling and softing! I will continue to use the products! Can&#x27;t wait to try the thermal defense system!  From what I can tell, Courtney, the founder,  has such a sweet spirit of giving and I believe that is why she is so successful!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a deep conditioner for my dry color treated hair and I&#x27;ve found it!  It has been my experience that you have to use a product, dry your hair and  flat iron it (or whatever your style preference) before you can see the small difference a product has made in your hair. NOT SO with the Green Tea and Carrot Deep conditioning mask. You can IMMEDIATELY tell the difference in your hair when you use this product!! It provides amazing slip and creates super soft tresses. Once I style my hair the body and shine is impeccable. A little of this product goes a long way so you are definitely getting more for your money.  You should really try this product....You have nothing to lose and you will gain beautifully soft, shiny, healthy hair.</li>
    <li> Ok so I needed a good deep conditioner and I saw this product And Tried It. I have really thick hair and now it feels healthier than ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve re ordered this product a few times....it leaves my really curly hair super soft , smelling good &amp; manageable!&lt;br /&gt;Best deep conditioner hands down!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommend it to others.get yours ASAP</li>
    <li> I have used this treatment twice and both times I couldn&#x27;t keep my hands out of my head. It made my hair so soft!!! I used this treatment on my daughter hair and she have thick corse hair normally it take 15 minutes to detangle with this treatment I was done in 5 minutes. It&#x27;s say a lot because you only need very little to get amazing results. I&#x27;m in love with this treatment I already order back ups .. I finally found my holy grail!! It&#x27;s rare I find a product that work for my daughter ,my sister and myself but this treatment does !!</li>
    <li> Im very particular with which conditioners I use in my hair. THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING!! It detangles my hair perfectly and the smell is AMAZING! You only need a little to make your hair super soft and get a deep conditioner. I LOVE THIS CONDITIONER!</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best deep conditioner I have ever used.  It leaves my hair soft and easy to manage.  After the first use I noticed hardly any shedding.  I  definitely recommend this product.  A quality product from a quality company.  Glad I made the mane choice!</li>
    <li> I have been natural for a very long time (12yrs) &amp; recently I have grown to start caring for my hair more. There are a lot of products out there but this one in particular caught my eye. I was never really into deep conditioning but this deep conditioner has given my hair life. I feel the moisture coming back into my hair because my hair was a. It on the dry side. My ends are looking good &amp; my hair definitely agrees with this conditioner. Not to mention the smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> -insert angels singing here-</li>

    <li> This product has been the best at keeping my natural mane Moisturized and well condition. I love this Conditioner.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love love this product. I was really weird about the products that I use in my hair but this product is the truth! I felt a difference in my hair after the first time using it. I had a major problem with shedding but with this and my hair dresser, I No longer Have this problem. I used to be a skeptic but I am No longer one. I can&#x27;t wait to try the hair pills.</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is amazing ! I have 4c hair and it&#x27;s very hard to detangle when in it&#x27;s afro state ! As well my hair sheds really bad ! Well let&#x27;s say it use too !

I&#x27;ve never had a product do EXACTLY what it says besides these products ! I use this every other week and I&#x27;ve noticed stronger, shiny, healthy hair ! I&#x27;m so thankful for Courtney&#x27;s products and I encourage anybody reading this review to go ahead and give it a try ! you won&#x27;t be disappointed !!</li>
    <li> This is THE BEST deep conditioner I have ever used. It left my hair so soft and manageable, and helped with my split ends and it smells great. It&#x27;s also mild enough that I can use it on my 6 year olds hair. I love love love allntheir products  but this one is my  favorite!</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner truly makes me happy! Paired with the manetabolism&lt;br /&gt;Vitamins I feel my hair unstoppable with this duo!!! This conditioner penetrates my hair like no other and make silky soft but also when detangling afterward there was little to NO SHEDDING!! I&#x27;m definitely working on my length retention and this conditioner gives me the chance to do just that. This product has saved the overall health in my hair. I order the mane choice products faithfully every pay day just to stock because it&#x27;s that amazing and it truly truly works for my hair. I&#x27;m so happy to share this with you all . No more delay you guys BUY THIS CONDITIONER!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! This is just another reason I made #themanechoice🙌🙌 HALLELUJAH!</li>
    <li> The Mane Choice green tea and carrot deep conditioning mask is a product that i&#x27;m happy i&#x27;ve invested in after discovering the way in which it made my hair look and feel. The mask contains loads of ingredients that nourished my hair in many ways. It strengthened my hair, ceased the shedding, added moisture and shine and also gave my hair a feeling of fullness. My hair was able to get a deep cleanse from this product. It is one that i&#x27;ll purchase again and i&#x27;m happy i&#x27;ve discovered it. #HappyCustomer Thank you</li>
    <li> This mask saved my hair! I tried it after following Courtney on instagram. Best purchase ever! My hair sheds like a cat but after using this the shedding was immediately reduced. I get about 10 stands or less of shed hair after I use this. I need to repurchase because I ran out.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! I have used it 3 times since I recieved it about a month ago and everyTIME I rinse it and style my curls they are AMAZING. I usually have to many thin fly aways and this deep conditioner tames my curls and makes this stick together the way they should and POP! I look forward to wash day the last couple of weeks! I would used it every week if the bottle did not say every two! I can&#x27;t wait to try the vitamins when my budget allows! I just big chopped and my hair loves it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this deep conditioner. I love the ingredients within it as well. I usually keep this in for 45min-1hr with no heat and I&#x27;ll rinse out with cold water and my hair feels so strong afterwards. The same strength I feel after a protein treatment, is what I receive when I use this deep conditioner. The smell is great and the consistency is just right. This deep conditioner is definately a staple item for me. I&#x27;ve ordered mine almost 3 months ago and I&#x27;m still on the same bottle, so a little hoes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is my second time ordering this product and I didn&#x27;t even allow myself to get halfway through the first bottle before ordering this one. WHAT AN AMAZINGLY made deep conditioner!! Your hair will not be able to deny all the organic goodness in this bottle regardless of your hair type, ethnicity, or race. THANK YOU Courtney for loving HEALTHY HAIR enough to create this staple for us!!</li>
    <li> I have only used this once in me and my daughter&#x27;s hair but on this first initial use I have to say that it didn&#x27;t &#x27;wow&#x27; me. I&#x27;ve used other products on a lower price range that have worked better. It was just &#x27;ok&#x27; for me. I would maybe purchase it again if it was on sale but other then that I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This deep conditioning mask is AMAZING! I absolutely love it. I purchased this mask at the World Natural Hair Show in Atlanta, Georgia. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that the face for this brand, founder, and CEO, Courtney, has gorgeous healthy hair. The fact that it&#x27;s formulated based on her personal hair growth practices is an initial sign of what to expect when using this mask. I had to check her product out, and I fell in love after my first use. I washed my hair as normal and then used this to deep condition my hair. I opted for using a Wal-Mart bag to let the deep conditioner sit on my hair for the suggested 45 minutes. After I washed the product out my hair felt luscious. Detangling my hair was a breeze, there was minimal shedding, and the shine my hair had was unbelievable. On top of all that MY CURLS WERE POPPING! If you are in doubt about purchasing this product, check out the ingredients. It&#x27;s greatness in a bottle. I follow Courtney and The Mane Choice on Instagram and she asked her followers to look up the price of carrot seed oil and if you are still doubting whether you should try this product I now task you with the assignment of looking up the price of carrot seed oil... Oh, MY! That alone made me love Courtney, The Mane Choice, and this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loooooove this deep conditioner. There isn&#x27;t any filler in it so it&#x27;s able to penetrate my strands. I have a crazy mixture of textures on my head and it was great for all of them. You just need to be frugal with it. It does feel really light so you may be tempted to add a lot because you&#x27;re used to thicker conditioners, but you don&#x27;t need to do that with this one since it&#x27;s concentrated with a lot of amazing ingredients. Also, I only use it once every 2 weeks or so and it&#x27;s been keeping my fragile strands strong and moisturized. Definitely will be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone dealing with dry hair especially if you&#x27;ve recently big chopped. Hunty, you might as well buy this and see how you like it. Your hair will thank you for it when it starts behaving :D</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product because I follow Courtney on instagram, have viewed her youtube videos and have followed her hair story and figured if her hair is this beautiful, gorgeous, full and amazing, she HAS to know what she is talking about!!!! I tried the deep conditioning mask and fell in love at first sight! After using it, my hair was sooo soft, manageable and felt great. After I had styled my hair somehow it seemed thicker and healthier and my grandmother even said your hair is looking better and better, much more thicker and really pretty and healthy. All in all I would recommend this product and have been telling my mom, line sisters and other friends to definitely try it. The product is not expensive (a little definitely goes a longggg way) and for the results that are shown (via Courtney) I believe in it and plan to purchase it as long as it is being produced. That also helped in making me feel comfortable to buy it because she shared her story and journey so that consumers who want to be natural (I have been for 10 years and searched and searched for good products to have healthy hair) would know it is possible and could work. I could go on and on about this conditioner but is definitely a staple product now in my hair regime and thank God for Courtney, The Mane Choice and this product!!! Keep up the great work and thanks for making wonderful products to have healthy hair!!</li>
    <li> When I purchase the green tea and carrot mask and felt the consistency I thought it was a joke thinking thicker is better but this mask prove me wrong since I started using the mask my hair became more manageable and less breakage the best part of using the green tea carrot mask my hair is so soft and not dry and brittle.</li>
    <li> By far the best deep conditioning treatment for thick/curly/coily hair!! Worth every penny!! A little goes a long way and it only has to be used twice per month.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money, I could have used that whole 8oz after one wash.I do love the vitamins but I would never purchase this item again. It does smell good though.</li>
    <li> I think this product is one of the best deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used. The only issue is there isn&#x27;t any slip which means I have to use another conditioner either before or after to detangle my hair. Only reason I&#x27;m rating it 4 stars</li>
    <li> smells great, makes my hair very shiny. Very lightweight,almost too lightweight that I think Im not putting enough in.</li>
    <li> I always suffered with short hair. It never grew, like ever. Since I started use mane choice products my hair has grown! This made my hair so much healthier, and soft. Not to mention the fact that the founder is a super sweet honest woman! Try it!</li>
    <li> You can tell these products work . The owner @courtneynaturalhair has long natural beautiful hair. Check out her Instagram if you think I&#x27;m lying.</li>
    <li> My hair absolutely loves this Deep Conditioner.. My hair is sooooo soft and moisturized after each use.. I use it&lt;br /&gt;bi-weekly..Heaven In A Bottle</li>
    <li> I always suffered with short hair. It never grew, like ever. Since I started taking these vitamins my hair has grown, so has my nails! Not to mention the fact that the founder is a super sweet honest woman! Try it! There&#x27;s no side effects. Although I haven&#x27;t tried this hair mask, and I would love to, the vitamins work wonders!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice so far because this deep conditioner gives my hair LIFE -- literally! It makes my hair shiny, strong, and my hair behaves so much better with styles after I use this product. My hair is just overall healthier from using this product.  It has a sweet scent from the lavender and grapefruit essential oils it contains which I enjoy. Sometimes I leave it in for 30 minutes, a couple times overnight, and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it either way.  One thing that gets me upset that it is a deep conditioner and not a leave-in conditioner is the curl definition it gives me. Especially on my sides, the CUTEST little ringlets come out,and I always have to remind myself of the products purpose so I can wash it out. I am a 3C, but I&#x27;ve also used this product on one of my male friends who is about a 4A or 4B and I was like &amp;#34;OMG YOUR CURLS!&amp;#34; because they were surely making an appearance. I&#x27;ve also noticed that a little bit goes a long way. I used to try to saturate my hair with it, which gave me only four uses with my first bottle, and from that I&#x27;d notice extra would come out when I&#x27;d wring my hair. Now I concentrate on my ends and use a spray bottle and lightly but evenly disburse it in my hair and now I can have my lovely fix last me longer. Yes, this IS a little pricey, but sometimes you have to treat yourself to see some magic happen.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 3 weeks I&#x27;ve deep conditioned my hair about 3-4 times I also use it in the shower as a regular conditioner. My hair is already soft and very fine I didn&#x27;t think my hair could get any softer then it already is but it is extremely soft now. I am very satisfied with this product because I have been using deep conditioner and I feel like nothing is working. I have had terrible damage done on my hair due to repeated bleaching. Which is why I chose to buy these products I see awesome reviews and I am sold!! I&#x27;m haven&#x27;t been using this mask for very long and already have seen a difference in my hair it is just so soft I love it. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this make from them and also the manetabolism as well!!</li>
    <li> Awesome awesome awesome I needed something to help with the texture of my hair and I found it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with extremely dry brittle hair that sheds. I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market for natural hair and nothing made my hair feel soft and hydrated like the green tea and carrot deep conditioner, not to mention my shedding has been cut in half! I love this product and highly reccomend it! I feel like I have a new head of manageable hair!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Your hair will feel greater each use. This is no ordinary conditioner. I literally use no other products after applying this product on my curls. I let it air dry and they are glossing and poppin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> LOVE it!!  This product has helped with the ongoing growth of my hair.  Perfect conditioner to use along with taking the vitamins from manechoice.</li>
    <li> My hair is really curly now it feels so healthy.</li>
    <li> I have been on a healthy hair/hair growth journey for the past 3 years and nothing else has made me retain as much length as this conditioner. Even while protective styling, when I deep condition I get the same results. I even just recently started using it on my daughter about 3 weeks ago and her hair has started to fill in already. I can definitely see the grow in her hair, as well as mine.</li>
    <li> I love this product... It  not only leaves my hair soft and manageable but smelling delightful as well. It really helps condition my hair locks in moisture between washes.  I also use it is a co-wash from time to time. I am looking forward to trying the other manechoice products.</li>
