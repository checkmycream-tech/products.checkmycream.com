<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Having just come back from Hawaii, I was so excited about wearing flowers in my hair!  This package of flowers covered all colors!!!  I get so many compliments on what a cute idea it is to perk up my outfits.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> These foam flowers were a big hit with the girls at a Hawaiian birthday party.  The simple flower design was very cute.  Lots of nice color combinations, and the colors were bright but not garish/neon.  The depth is a bit more than necessary -- the flower stuck out far enough that I tended to brush it with my hand by accident -- but it was not a big deal.  I put one in my hair and got compliments from the other moms when they arrived to pick up.</li>
    <li> In short: Very happy with the purchase. I would suggest that if this is something you are looking to buy, this is a good product to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these figuring that I would take a chance--since I read some bad reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad that I did because the variety of colors and patterns is varied. You are not going to get the exact color combinations that you see in the picture, but I did get white, pink, green, blue, purple, yellow, orange, etc. I&#x27;m really happy with the paint job. Not sure if they have cracked down on the quality standards, but the petals are painted very nicely and had very nice airbrush shading and blending.  The petals don&#x27;t move around like they are going to fall off. The clip stays secure on what I put it on. The flower does sit up high, but that&#x27;s normal for a fake flower clip. I&#x27;m not expecting it to be flat...  Works well with putting one in my hair.  Got lots of attention. Perfect for summer parties and even just wanting to look cute on a regular day.</li>
    <li> These are soft on my hair and I give them to others. They&#x27;re very pretty.</li>
    <li> Such a great product.  Delivery was so fast and packaging kept these little blooms protected.  I&#x27;m very impressed with the quality.  I paid $7 for a small foam flower at the Ren Fest last year and was so excited with that purchase - you can imagine how I feel about this one.  Love the colors and love the realistic appeal of the material used to create these flowers.  Whenever I wear them I get complements all the time ~ They have to touch them to realize they&#x27;re foam.      I&#x27;m going to buy another set for my friend for Christmas and I&#x27;m also going to check out the other products they have like this (earrings, bracelets, etc).  It&#x27;s a steal, especially with free shipping - I mean c&#x27;mon!</li>
    <li> Love them all!! Stick in your hair perfect and look great. Way better in person than what the picture portrays too ; ) I would recommend these to a friend!</li>
    <li> We bought this as a goody bag item for our baby shower. The item arrived as promised and it was the best crowd pleaser. All my friends were asking where I got it and all little girls liked it very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good to one to buy as a goody bag gift item</li>
    <li> Product arrived exactly as pictured and described. I&#x27;ve lived in Hawaii and these foam flowers do retail for about $4+. This is the BEST DEAL ever and the flowers are all beautiful and lovely. I really enjoyed the variety and bundle pack!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received so many compliments on them that I ended up giving some away to friends. I&#x27;m just about to buy myself another set because you just can&#x27;t beat this price!!</li>
    <li> The flowers were the same as the photo, best price for what you get. I looked all over the web and these were the best I found. Amazingly fast shipping, and durable product. Have worn almost all of them and they look great, not to big and fit great on the side of my hair, beside my ear. Thank you, completely recomend!!!</li>
    <li> These flowers are gorgeous and look pretty real and life-like. The foam is very lightweight. The size is perfect and they look exactly as pictured. This is an excellent price for 12 flowers. They arrived very quickly. I get lots of compliments when I wear them. I wish they were available on picks as well as clips. An excellent purchase!</li>
    <li> First of all the flowers are perfect!  They are so beautiful and fit perfectly in my hair!  And second of all, this company is great!  I ordered these flowers at the end of December, and was to receive them by the beginning of January.  When I was checking the status of the package it stated it was delivered.  I even checked my local post office and the package was no where to be found.  When I contacted the seller, I received prompt feedback.  They stated they would cover postage loss and re-send the flowers, which they did and I received them within 3 days!  Again beautiful flowers just like they are pictured, and from a company with great customer service!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Five of the Twelve flowers I received were almost identical...all yellow pink and white. I even sent a picture in to complain but because they were not exactly the same, they said my only option was to return them at my own expense. The photo of twelve different flowers and the promise of twelve \\&quot;unique\\&quot; designs is totally misleading. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I love these hair clips and so does everyone that sees me wearing them. A few people have walked up and had to touch them to see if they&#x27;re real... LOL... Plus, I got them @ a great price. I am Samoan and what does everyone think or say when I have these on &amp;#34; you look Hawaiian&amp;#34; , you remind me of Hawaii&amp;#34;... LOL..  That&#x27;s ok I got a great price for the amount I got and I look great wearing them. If I say so myself... Buy buy buy... LOL</li>
    <li> These clips are beautiful, simple and practical!!  Amazing price and service!!!  The clips were packed in a perfect sized box with a layer of bubble wrap.  They were in excellent condition and packaged well.  They attach well to the hair and look lovely!  I love these plumeria flower hair clips!!!</li>
    <li> loved them ! Got many compliments and love that they come in different color options! fun and easy to attach to hair</li>
    <li> The flowers are pretty.  They are as pictured.  However the clip barrette is very sharp!  I plan on giving these out to all the little girls at our birthday luau, but I have to cover each and every one with a ribbon or something soft first.  What a pain.</li>
    <li> I was in Hawaii and should of grabbed them while I was there but didn&#x27;t so I was happy to find them online.</li>
    <li> I so loved the flowers. My 3 &amp; 5 yr. old daughters loved it as well. I also used some for bday party give away. It&#x27;s an awesome item to add with gift for bdays.</li>
    <li> I just love these clips! I spent months trying to find these before I finally thought to search on amazon! Before all I was hoping to find was one simple white or pink flower. Now I have all twelve of these colors and I&#x27;m so thrilled with them! Every time I wear one I get compliments on it! Some people even think they&#x27;re real! I&#x27;ll be back to order more styles and colors for sure!</li>
    <li> *AND* cheaper than what you would pay if you were vacationing on any of the islands. ;)    My son destroyed all of the flower clips I bought when we went to Kauai... and, unfortunately, they&#x27;re the only (artificial) flower clips I ever want to wear in my hair. They&#x27;re all great quality, and I&#x27;m definitely very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These are great love all the different colors. The price was really good till for this bundle for 12 of Them.</li>
    <li> Great mix of flowers for your hair and it came SO QUICK that I did a double take when I saw it was from Hawaii! It was at my door within 2 days of ordering it!</li>
    <li> I ordered for the same reason most other people did.... they would match anything except for the fact that almost every flower was white in the center and pink on the edges. I didnt recieve a green, yellow outside, solid yellow, yellow centered or white. ALL PINK! and on top of that if you lift up a petal the area that was covered by that petal isn&#x27;t painted. I would suggest buying elsewhere.</li>
    <li> When I was in Hawaii, I fell in love with these flowers and I got an assortment of these foam hair clips as souvenirs for my girlfriends. They all loved them! Now I am planning a Hawaiian party for my brother&#x27;s fiancee&#x27;s bridal shower and I am so happy to find these flowers on Amazon! They will be perfect for the party and all girls will get to choose the color they like and they will get to keep it as a party favour.</li>
    <li> The colors in the picture weren&#x27;t the same as those I received, and there were doubles of some colors. Also, the quality wasn&#x27;t as good as plumeria clips I have bought elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is the best deal I&#x27;ve found on these.  I live on the beach and these are sold in stores everywhere here for about $5-6 each and up.</li>
    <li> Awsome deal. Plenty of flowers for the price. The flowers texture and appearance are good. I will buy more for future parties and gatherings.</li>
    <li> We used these flowers in a musical in the girls hair. They looked beautiful on the stage. Would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this set of hair clips, they arrived as pictured and the colours are true. I am however a little disappointed by the quality. I have purchased foam Plumeria hair accessories before and I had imagined that these would be similar however they are much larger and much thinner than I had expected, while this actually makes them probably more true to the real flowers it does mean that the petals are more likely to be bent out of shape and it also means that on top of the clip they look quite large on and stick quite far off your head. I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and glad that I bought them as the variety is so lovely and the colours are really very pretty, but I do think that smaller, thicker flowers might have made for more wearable and longer lasting hair clips.</li>
    <li> These plumerias are pretty, and they&#x27;re affordable, but they&#x27;re not perfect unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) They&#x27;re very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;2) They&#x27;re cheap.&lt;br /&gt;3) Easy to wear, the clip stays in place well.&lt;br /&gt;4) Did I mention they&#x27;re pretty?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The build quality is questionable. The metal clip section on one of the flowers broke in half within the first day of receiving them, and the other clips don&#x27;t look much sturdier.&lt;br /&gt;2) The colors represented on the website don&#x27;t match the same tones as the actual flowers I got in the mail.  -- Don&#x27;t get me wrong here, the flowers do come in the 12 different color schemes as shown on the description, but the hues are all darker and deeper than the pictures show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t mind the differences in hue because the plumerias look very nice, and the differences are slight;  however, despite all of my other compliments for the product, I am just sad and disappointed that they use cheap clips that fall apart within 1 day of use, and as a result I just can&#x27;t give this anything higher than 3 stars.</li>
    <li> These turned out very life like and pretty. I may not have received exactly the ones pictured but the description was correct, I got 12 very different colors (green,orange,pink,etc) so it was not just a variety of white like other reviews described. Great value considering others are selling for $5 each plus shipping, may as well get this bundle and gift a few.</li>
    <li> I am very displeased with these items. They are HORRIBLE quality. It says &amp;#34;individually packaged&amp;#34;, but they all come in one bag, so they are all smashed up. They claim to be the same as the ones you can buy in Hawaii for &amp;#34;$4-$5&amp;#34;. This is not true at all. I&#x27;ve been to Hawaii. The hair clips there are MUCH HIGHER quality. There should be no comparison. That&#x27;s false advertisement. If you need them for a kids thing or something not important, buy them, but don&#x27;t buy with the expectation of them being at the same standard as the ones you would buy in Hawaii (I believe those are made out of clay or something much more sturdy).</li>
    <li> Great price for so many flowers! And all the colors are great to mix with whatever you&#x27;re wearing. Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Just lovely and multiuseful</li>
    <li> These are cute little foam flowers you can attach to things like a helmet, clothes or a bag. The glue will eventually wear off and they can&#x27;t be worn in the hair as the clip is rough and will tear them out. I had one on my bike helmet for several months before it fell apart. I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> SEarched 4 these a long time. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> got exactly what is pictured and it looks great on me and my daughter.  Can be used a a clip on shirt too and you never notice its a hair pin.</li>
    <li> I ordered the flowers so i could wear one/some while i was going to be in Hawaii. I was very pleased with the product. They are a soft foam material. They held very well while in my hair. I ended up wearing the all white one for my wedding while in Hawaii. It looked so real. Even in the pictures you couldnt tell the difference. The size is perfect. They are pretty close in size to the real thing, about 2 1/2\\&quot; wide. They are perfect for any occasion. Or no occasion at all. Unfortunatly my white one ripped in my suitcase on the way home, so i will be ordering the whole set so i can have that one again. I dont mind having a bunch of clips. Cant have too many.</li>
    <li> These flowers are great. I ordered them because I have a collection. Its easy to clip onto my hair and the colors are bright and pretty. I do recommend them A LOT! and especially at this price, it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> How can i return it back?</li>
    <li> The flowers are made of a foam material that doesn&#x27;t hold or keep it&#x27;s shape very well. But they served their purpose and they are pretty cute. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again. But mostly because it came with 12 and I haven&#x27;t even taken half of them out of the bag yet.</li>
    <li> Larger than expected, should have read the description. Made well. My granddaughter loved them but they were too big for what I wanted them for.</li>
    <li> I would have given 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the doubles of the flowers; I received 6 colors twice. The clips are very easily clipped on any type of hair. Shipping was quick. Once more 5 stars if not for the repeat flower colors.</li>
    <li> We first saw these pretty little foam flower in Hawaii where they were popular with both locals and tourist.  I&#x27;d bought a few there, but wanted more after getting home and was delighted to see them available here, and bonus, for much less than I&#x27;d paid in Hawaii.&lt;br /&gt;A good purchase!</li>
    <li> These were great held their foam shape and looked great in our hair in Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Lovely and perfect! Suited my needs perfectly. The flowers look just like they were advertised as. Would recommend. pretty. pretty.</li>
    <li> Ever since I went to Hawaii, I am wearing these in my hair everyday.  Everyone comments on my hair and asks where I got them</li>
    <li> Nice to buy these flowers in bulk. You don&#x27;t get to pick the colors, but sometimes that&#x27;s the fun of receiving them and seeing what you get. The price is definitely right. Only problem with some, is due to the foam texture, the clips can dig into each other during shipping and leave imprints on the petals. Not too damaged, but it can happen.</li>
    <li> I use these for everything decorative.</li>
    <li> So these flowers are kinda so-so; I think you get what you pay for in this case:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, the picture doesn&#x27;t really show the actual flowers you receive. Half of mine look VERY similar to one another--but not identical, which is how they get away with saying you get 12 unique ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paint looks a bit cheap, and you can see the unpainted parts of the foam when the petals move around (which happens a lot, as the foam is flimsy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flowers themselves are very TALL; something you cannot see in the pictures. I found that they were so bulky on my head that you couldn&#x27;t even see the flower in my hair--rather all you see is this metal clip and this white foam popping out of your hair. I actually disassembled and reconstructed my clips so that they would be more flattering and look nicer in my hair (and I&#x27;m happy with how they look now). I just trimmed off about 1/3 an inch from the flower stems and re-glued them on the clip. They look much nicer now, and you can actually see the coloured part in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, these are things you could easily make yourself (as I learned in my deconstruction process). They are put together using a glue gun, and i was frustrated with the number of large glue strings hanging off the clips, and the visible glue-blobs that I had to pick off of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I give them 2 stars because they were cheap (and thus I didn&#x27;t expect MUCH), however the little expectations I had were pretty crushed.&lt;br /&gt;My tip? Buy supplies from a craft store and make these yourself!</li>
    <li> I carried 6 hawaiian flower hair clips back from hawaii for the ladies at work. They were a huge hit! The guys even got a little jealous. I was so excited to find them on amazon, and I purchased 2 packages to give everyone else at work a flower. I also bought 1 more package for a friend&#x27;s bday gathering. Everyone loved the colors! It was so cool to see something so simple put so many smiles on faces! THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I have a very girly girl, very long haired 8yo and a 4yo niece that follows her lead. They love to dress their tresses. The foam was glued on perfectly to the clip. No dried on dripping glue, not sloppy at all. This is just like the ones we bought in Hawaii except I bought 12 pieces vs. 3 pieces for the same price these were. Bulk is great! Received as expected, packaged appropriately, colorful, and quality is exactly as I hoped they would be. Now I know where to get refills when they lose them and they will lose them. &#x3D;oD</li>
    <li> First off... these actually come from Hawaii! They are beautiful and I&#x27;ve even had a few people ask if they were real. My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t rest closer to your head - but that is just my preference. These are worth the buy! I&#x27;ve even clipped one on a headband and worn it that way too.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I love these clips!! the metal clip is kinda big if you want to put it in your hair behind your ear, so I changed a few of them to smaller clips, but if you put them other places the clip is hidden by your hair. :-)\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Went to hawaii and saw some but these are MUCH less expensive. Makes a great gift for hawaiian dancers who need to dress up their hair.</li>
    <li> Very cute for my daughters ballet recital.  These are simple foam flowers, the package I received had all the varieties of colors displayed in the picture.  They stay well in place in my daughters hair when it is pulled up into a pony tail and then placing the flower near the hair tie.</li>
    <li> Cute flowers, good quality even though Styrofoam and clip into hair well. Perfect for Hawaiian theme parties. Would recommend for others.</li>
    <li> These clips are bright and beautiful. Look great on kids. I placed them as a goodies in treat bags of girls for my daughter&#x27;s b&#x27;day party. They all liked them. One of the clips was broken and when I emailed the seller, they said that they would replace that particular clip. Please note that these are not a &amp;#34;set of clips&amp;#34;. They are individual clips only and you do not get 2 of each color. The word &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; in the title simply means that you get 12 clips in one pack, which I thought was a little deceptive as I was expecting 12 sets of hair clips (2 of each color) which was the only disappointment.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on these. I just wish they made them on ponytail holders. If you like wearing flowers in your hair I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> The color and variety is beautiful and they are so quick and easy to put on. I love them. I get lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> These are nice looking flowers, almost exactly like the ones we found in Hawaii when we visited there about 1 year ago. They are on clips, but you can take them off (we made them into a fake lei).</li>
    <li> This was everything i thought I would be. Very great customer service, arrived on time. I would work with this company again.</li>
    <li> I was so happy with my purchase.  It was just like the images on your website.  I could not be more pleased.  The plumerias are so lifelike and realistic, so captivating to the eye.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We razzle dazzle the buyers.  Most people think that they are real.  I have to convice them by allowing them to touch the frangipanis or plumerias. Kudos to the creator of such a lifelike and beautiful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helenka</li>
    <li> As is stated in other reviews, what is pictured is not necessarily what comes in the bundle.  I knew that when I purchased, but hoped for the best.  They were mostly different, although you had to look closely at some for the faint differences.  For the price, it was still a great buy, but the order should match what is pictured or be stated very well what to really expect.  I figured we can give some away for friends birthdays too if we need to.  My daughter loves them.</li>
    <li> great product, fast shipping</li>
    <li> These came in the mail and are GORGEOUS. They are perfect in every way. Just flawless.  If you are thinking about buying these, get them, because they are everything you want and hope them to be!!!!! They look beautiful in your hair too!!</li>
    <li> I like very much these flowers as I bought some in South Pacific several years ago, but I gave them to friends, and I wanted some for myself. As some others did, I ordered them and took a chance, after reading the bad reviews. I was a little bit disappointed how they looked in my hair because as many others said, they are not flat, but high. However, I went on YouTube and searched for a video on how the foam flowers are made and saw that if you want to give the petal a shape, you have to use a candle and heat the petal and then model the shape you want. So I heated the back of the flower in the center (the metal clip actually) and then I pressed in the center of the flower slowly in order to flatten it, and it worked nice. You have to be careful because the heated metal can burn and also the glue is melting on too much heat. Anyway, if you handle it slowly and careful, it works and it only takes one minute. After I flattened the center, I modeled every petal as I wanted, so my flowers look perfect now. Before flattening them I could see the metal clip, but now I can only see the flower like a real one would look in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy that I bought them, even if the quality as they came was not perfect, but the colors were almost the same as in the picture and the size is perfect, not too big, similar size as the real flower. The clip is very strong and will never break as it is metal (the ones I had before were from plastic and after a while some broke).  I do recommend others to buy them but they have to be aware that the flowers as they come do not look nice in the hair because of the height, however there is a way to make them flat as I explained above.</li>
    <li> Great clips!! Love them!</li>
    <li> Purchased these lovely hair clips for my adult daughter who joined hula dancing at the YMCA.  The clips arrived as pictured and described.  They are small enough to not overwhelm and large enough to attract compliments.  Very pretty and colorful.</li>
    <li> Whomever or whatever machine glues the flowers to the clips, these had a huge glue glob and strings from the hot glue on several of the flowers, the flowers stick up way to high from the side they look odd in your hair</li>
    <li> I purchased these to clip onto some hats I crocheted for my nieces.  The flowers are foam, so they&#x27;re very light, and the clip is well-secured to the flower.  I&#x27;m not afraid of the flowers or petals coming loose.  These flowers were the perfect addition to what I made for them.  They were just nice to add a little extra touch of color and interest.  Also, since they&#x27;re clips, they girls can take them off and use them on whatever they want.  Adorable.</li>
    <li> We gave these away as party favors to female guests for our daughter&#x27;s 5th birthday party, and it was a hit.  Great value and very good quality.</li>
    <li> THEY ARE NOT WHAT I THINK AND WANT. IN THE PICTURE IT LOOK VERY NICE, BUT FOR THE REAL ONES NOT.</li>
    <li> Typical swap meet hawaiian style flowers.</li>
