      <li>It worked GREAT for my hair back then and gave me really good shine and moisture.</li>
      <li>When I got this product I literally ran into the shower and was very excited to use TSUBAKI.</li>
      <li>This shampoo gave me a nice clean without drying.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for the first time after seeing all the good reviews and I do LOVE the treatment, I have to say the shampoo and conditioner were just alright.</li>
      <li>I really like that it comes in a large size with a pump that dispenses the perfect amount.</li>
      <li>It works great on her hair, always leaving it soft and shiny!</li>
      <li>Most drugstore and salon brands work fine</li>
      <li>My mom, my sister, and myself have always had very fine hair that is very prone to damage, thus breaking off very easily.</li>
      <li>lasts me two years easily).</li>
      <li>Strong smell</li>
      <li>First, the smell of this set is absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>Love love and love this product so much.</li>
      <li>My parents live in Los Angeles and therefore have easy access to these products and whenever I go to visit them, my hair is always spectacularly shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I am a huge fan of this product and always have it stocked in my shower.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;-makes hair smooth and sleek</li>
      <li>But since using this, my hair is smooth and sleek all the time.</li>
      <li>they smell soooooo good and make your hair soooo soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a week now, but the results are really nice!</li>
      <li>Worth every cent!</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t normally do sleek without any work, but it just laid really nicely.  </li>
      <li>if you will, there is nothing but quality ingredients, resulting in the silky, HEALTHY, pretty hair you&#x27;ve always dreamed of.</li>
      <li>One pump of shampoo foams a lot and is sufficient every time I clean my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair now is more damaged, drier, and needs a different kind of help .</li>
      <li>I think the shampoo didn&#x27;t really had any effect on my hair, except the conditioner, which did make my a lot more smooth.</li>
      <li>and i want one that can moisture my hair,but i don&#x27;t think this one is good enough.</li>
      <li>also good people at japanese outlet!!!  </li>
      <li>and have a full bottle of shampoo left.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I used them without the treatment I didn&#x27;t really feel my hair was very smooth, and when I used the treatment with other shampoo and conditioner my hair still looked and felt nice!</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair super glossy and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The Shiseido new Tsubaki set is hand down the best hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just a very satisfied consumer of the Shiseido&#x27;s Tsubaki Shampoo that believes this product could help you if you have the same hair problems I had.</li>
      <li>It works wonders, leaves your hair looking like you just stepped out of a Pantene commercial (something that actual Pantene has never managed to do, ironically), and the smell is so great that you&#x27;ll have people complimenting the lovely fragrance all the time.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I was amazed by how soft my hair felt and blew out nice and shiny.  </li>
      <li>I think it really kept my hair strong and defended against damage throughout those years.</li>
      <li>I think you can already tell, but I highly recommend it!!!</li>
      <li>Amazing for asian hair</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s worth trying when you can save a bit buying the bundle.  </li>
      <li>I really love the smell, and how soft my hair feels afterwards.</li>
      <li>It also smells really nice and the scent lasts for several hours.</li>
      <li>If your hair is really damaged, the white or gold versions work much better as they are stronger and more concentrated with ingredients.</li>
      <li>this is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>but overall my hair was pretty healthy and strong.</li>
      <li>Right from the first time I tried it</li>
      <li>Having heard that the Japanese do beauty supplies WAY better, I thought I&#x27;d check this out...and they were right.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much either.</li>
      <li>The smell is also amazing because it is so subtle, yet pleasing, not overpowering;  and it smells natural, not like most shampoos available elsewhere.</li>
      <li>This is my first time straying from Head and Shoulders or Pantene type shampoos</li>
      <li>and I remembered the first time I used it</li>
      <li>Not only is this cheaper but comes with a lot more product.</li>
      <li>I know it is the tsubaki oil to thank, and the absense of \\&quot;fillers\\&quot; that most American shampoos have.</li>
      <li>It was delivered fast!</li>
      <li>Heavy scent is good for people who like their hair to smell</li>
      <li>After the first use, i noticed immediately positive results with just one pump:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty much will be a godsend to straight hair</li>
      <li>Like many women, I&#x27;ve struggled with dry, brittle, and damaged hair that just wouldn&#x27;t grow.</li>

    <li> The product didn&#x27;t deliver.  The Shampoo dried my hair out &amp; made it a tangled mess.  I&#x27;m currently using it to bath my dogs.  It does have a pleasant smell but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  No issues with the seller... It was delivered fast!</li>
    <li> I have to say this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have used in many many years. In an attempt to control my wavy, frizzy hair I have tried many things including C/O washing which worked fine but wasn&#x27;t perfect. My boyfriend introduced me to this while I was visiting him and I am so happy he did. This is the best my hair has looked since I was a teenager. My hair is manageable, shiny and the frizz is completely under control. I don&#x27;t even have to style it to control the frizz anymore. I can simply wash and let my hair dry naturally if I wish. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> great product , smells great!!!  also good people at japanese outlet!!!  a++++</li>
    <li> The shampoo works wonders to make hair soft and supple.  It smells slightly perfume-like, but it&#x27;s not too strong and worked better on my hair than the Golden Repair version sold in the white bottles.  This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used so it&#x27;s worth trying when you can save a bit buying the bundle.  This seems like it would do well on all kinds of hair types.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been thick and very hard to keep well conditioned and moisturized. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve been constantly trying all kinds of shampoos and conditioners that are out there: from the very cheap ones from the grocery stores to the very expensive ones that you can find in beauty salons, but nothing worked for me. Just when I thought there was not any hope for my hair, I found the Tsubaki Shampoo and Conditioner from Shiseido at an asian store. It was a little bit expensive, but decided to give it a try since I had nothing to lose, and that&#x27;s when I discovered the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. Since the first use, I felt the difference in my hair, because it felt soft, silky, and it was very manageable. And I also got a little bonus I didn&#x27;t expect: Because all the other shampoos tend to dry my scalp, I had dandruff. Of course, I used all kinds of anti-dandruff shampoos trying to get rid of this problem, like Head&amp;Shoulders and Selsun Blue, getting only little or no results, but it wasn&#x27;t until I started using the Tsubaki Shampoo that the dandruff disappeared completely!&lt;br /&gt;I know, it sounds like I work for Shiseido and they are going to give me big bucks just for posting this comment, but believe me, that&#x27;s not the case. I&#x27;m just a very satisfied consumer of the Shiseido&#x27;s Tsubaki Shampoo that believes this product could help you if you have the same hair problems I had. So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m recommending it ^^</li>
    <li> Basically, this is probably the best shampoo and conditioner set I&#x27;ve used in the States.  You can get it on Amazon or from Japanese or Korean markets, if you have one  near your neighborhood.      The smell is also amazing because it is so subtle, yet pleasing, not overpowering;  and it smells natural, not like most shampoos available elsewhere.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  Smells wonderful and my hair is shiny and soft :  I really like that it comes in a large size with a pump that dispenses the perfect amount.</li>
    <li> Like many women, I&#x27;ve struggled with dry, brittle, and damaged hair that just wouldn&#x27;t grow. My mom, my sister, and myself have always had very fine hair that is very prone to damage, thus breaking off very easily. These problems always made it impossible for us to have \\&quot;pretty hair\\&quot;, you know- the shiny, bouncy, soft-looking hair that you see in commercials. AND NOW WE HAVE THAT COMMERCIAL HAIR! Thanks to this product. I know it is the tsubaki oil to thank, and the absense of \\&quot;fillers\\&quot; that most American shampoos have. This is \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot; if you will, there is nothing but quality ingredients, resulting in the silky, HEALTHY, pretty hair you&#x27;ve always dreamed of. I am a huge fan of this product and always have it stocked in my shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo and conditioner for about a week now, but the results are really nice! I have dry, brittle hair and occasional dandruff problems, but my hair is now soft and supple and the dandruff is gone! This is my first time straying from Head and Shoulders or Pantene type shampoos so I&#x27;m really impressed by this product. It also smells really nice and the scent lasts for several hours. Love it!</li>
    <li> Recently, while visiting and staying with my daughter, I used her Shiseido shampoo and conditioner.  I just loved it.  When I got home I ordered the shampoo, conditioner and treatment.  Right from the first time I tried it I found that it really made my hair soft and manageable.  I could tell a difference in my hair after just rinsing off the shampoo even before I put on the conditioner. My hair just had a different feel to it. I highly recommend this product.  I color my hair and this trio has really made a difference.  It is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have waist-length virgin Asian hair that I almost never use heat on, and I live in Hawaii. Most hair products cause my hair to get tangled and impossible to tame when the air gets too humid. But since using this, my hair is smooth and sleek all the time. I can even skip a wash day every so often, which I can normally never do because of how humidity normally wreaks havoc on my hair.</li>
    <li> First of all, I cannot ever live without this product ever again. I&#x27;m not usually a stickler for any particular brand of shampoo/condition.  Lately though, I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;ve had a lot more hair fall-out than before and i had to go back to the salon more often to get the dry ends trimmed off.  A few friends of mine (all with beautiful long long hair) have all been using it and recommended it to me as I&#x27;ve always noticed that no matter how much they dye/perm their hair, it still remained lustrous and soft.  Let me say, i am now a firm believer that good shampoo/conditioner does make a big difference.  After the first use, i noticed immediately positive results with just one pump:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dry ends became moisturized and soft, less tangles (wet and after drying)&lt;br /&gt;hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down, clean feeling, and still bouncy at the end of a long day&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;scalp is less oily and itchy&lt;br /&gt;because i have naturally straight hair, after drying, it falls around my face like it&#x27;s been blow dried (which is should i say...awesome!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a cheap product but i like that it doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  Spending a lil extra on daily care is also saving me more in the end for lesser trips to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiseido Tsubaki is my savior, i can&#x27;t wait to try their other lines!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used shampoo and conditioners from all over the spectrum of origin, ingredient, and price range for the last twenty years.  The Shiseido new Tsubaki set is hand down the best hair care products I&#x27;ve ever used.  I  haven&#x27;t seen my hair this healthy in longer than I care to admit.  There is no doubt in my mind this is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo.  It adds moisture and shine to hair.  It also strengthens and  promotes growth!</li>
    <li> they smell soooooo good and make your hair soooo soft. ever since i used them in japan, i&#x27;ve been looking for these online here so i can buy them.</li>
    <li> My parents live in Los Angeles and therefore have easy access to these products and whenever I go to visit them, my hair is always spectacularly shiny and healthy. I can&#x27;t stop touching it! My Asian hair looks really dull using the gamut of American hair products.</li>
    <li> I gave it 4 of 5 stars because I think the product itself is great, but it wasn&#x27;t compatible with my type 2C hair.  It dried it out a bit.  I gave it to my friend who has straight hair, and it worked great for her.  I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s fair to rate the product poorly just because my hair is curly and has a mind of it&#x27;s own.  Just not for me....but seems to work great for others.</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo &amp; conditioner my daughter uses! It works great on her hair, always leaving it soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> I found this product while I was living in Japan.  Even though my hair is not like typical Japanese hair types (I have very fine hair), it has had a dramatic effect.  It leaves my hair super glossy and shiny.  I love it.  Now that I&#x27;ve returned back to the states, I have been really surprised that Shiseido doesn&#x27;t market it here. Thank goodness for Amazon and this seller or I would have to get my friends to ship it to me from Japan!! I think you can already tell, but I highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> After years of struggling with dry, frizzy hair with tons of split-ends, I finally broke down and decided to look for a more expensive shampoo and conditioner than the cheap drugstore brands I have always used.  After tons of research I decide to buy the Shiseido Tsubaki Shining line (Red package).  I also must mention that recently I got a very bad haircut which has not helped, I have to color my hair often due to lots of grey hair and I live in the mountains where the water is full of sediment and minerals and is not very good to the hair since it makes your hair feel like straw most of the time.  I was basically at the point where I was looking for a miracle product which I have found in Shiseido!  My hair is amazingly soft, shiny and I have immediately noticed less breakage.  In fact I have not even seen any hair in my shower after using this product.  I have read reviews where it causes dandruff and itching but I have not experienced this after using this product for two and a half weeks. It does not weigh my hair down at all.  I like the floral scent as well but overall never cared too much about how a product smells, just how it works.    In the time I have been using it, since my hair is so much healthier, my hair is starting to grow faster and now my bad haircut is starting to get less noticable because my hair is growing back in.  Also, I colored my hair the other day and usually by the second shampoo/conditioning after coloring, the normal drugstore brands cannot even penetrate my hair to make it soft, I can barely get a comb through it.  Well with the Shiseido, my hair is soft and I cannot even tell I just colored it.  Amazing!      Even though this is my review for Shiseido, I wanted to mention that I use AG Fast Food leave in conditioner mixed with a little of FX Lotus Shine Serum before blow drying and this whole combination made a world of difference!      Buy this shampoo and conditioner, you will fall in love just like I did.  This is the first time I ever wrote a review for a shampoo and conditioner, that is how good this stuff is!!</li>
    <li> I really love the smell, and how soft my hair feels afterwards. I&#x27;m not sure how well the treatment works, but the shampoo really does wonders. You don&#x27;t need to use very much either. I have really long hair, so I used a full pump or two the first time, but it was way too much.</li>
    <li> When I got this product I literally ran into the shower and was very excited to use TSUBAKI. The scent is just amazing. It smells like Japanese candy. when I used the shampoo and the conditioner my hair felt silky soft and when I went outside I had a halo on my head!! :) BEST PRODUCT EVER!! Yes, I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Actually, i don&#x27;t like this except the smell.My hair is dry and i want one that can moisture my hair,but i don&#x27;t think this one is good enough.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this really helped my hair or not. I think the shampoo didn&#x27;t really had any effect on my hair, except the conditioner, which did make my a lot more smooth. And I love the smell of it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the first time after seeing all the good reviews and I do LOVE the treatment, I have to say the shampoo and conditioner were just alright. When I used them without the treatment I didn&#x27;t really feel my hair was very smooth, and when I used the treatment with other shampoo and conditioner my hair still looked and felt nice! They smell good but nothing special. I will purchase the treatment again, LOVE LOVE LOVE it!</li>
    <li> I adore Tsubaki, and I was so happy when I saw it here so I could continue using it after getting hooked on it in Japan!  It works wonders, leaves your hair looking like you just stepped out of a Pantene commercial (something that actual Pantene has never managed to do, ironically), and the smell is so great that you&#x27;ll have people complimenting the lovely fragrance all the time.</li>
    <li> I have been considering trying an asian shampoo for awhile now and was certainly not disappointed.  A little background: I am mixed (korean and white) but have more of a typical asian hair type (very thick straight hair). Most drugstore and salon brands work fine (maybe a little dry and frizzy at the ends) but I&#x27;ve always had a little problem of my scalp breaking out because my skin produces a lot of oil when not moisturized enough.  Having heard that camellia (tsubaki) oil works wonders for hair and skin, I decided to try this product.  First, the smell of this set is absolutely amazing.  They really should make a perfume of this scent, because I&#x27;m a little obsessed.  It does fade a little quickly on my hair though.  As far as the efficacy of the product, the shampoo I felt was not drying at all.  I could feel an immediate difference in the feel of my hair (maybe a bit thicker and smoother?) it felt very healthy.  This shampoo gave me a nice clean without drying.  I got the impression of balance.  The conditioner didn&#x27;t have as much of the slick feeling when washing off that I normally associate with conditioner, but it actually made my hair softer and more noticeably moisturized than other conditioners.  The treatment was lovely as well.  I left it on for about 5 minutes, and it seemed to make my hair even more soft and moisturized.  After my hair dried (I&#x27;ve tried blow drying and air drying) it felt noticeably soft, sleek and healthier.  My hair doesn&#x27;t normally do sleek without any work, but it just laid really nicely.  I didn&#x27;t notice any greasiness, and within a week, my scalp is actually no longer breaking out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-beautiful addictive smell&lt;br /&gt;-large amount&lt;br /&gt;-healthy balanced moisture for hair AND scalp&lt;br /&gt;-makes hair smooth and sleek w/out weighing it down&lt;br /&gt;-made my scalp stop breaking out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-scented (for those who don&#x27;t like that)&lt;br /&gt;-bottle is in Japanese (for people who like to read the bottle) but camewith a little label w/ingredients and instructions in english&lt;br /&gt;-not really a con for the product, but my boyfriend knocked over the shower caddy on accident and the pump for the shampoo shattered ;_;, so I guess try not to drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this has become my HG of hair product. Will absolutely buy again.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised with this shampoo set and how my hair is responded to it.  The first time I used it I was amazed by how soft my hair felt and blew out nice and shiny.  It did not weigh my hair down nor did it make it flyaway.  I have Asian hair, long with layers and I felt it nourished my hair and scalp.  It was not too oily or drying on my scalp either - either one would set my scalp itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other reviewers that it&#x27;s rather perfumey and I remembered the first time I used it I could still smell the fragrance in my hair the next day.  It doesn&#x27;t smell cheap or sickly but it does take getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note about the treatment though, I&#x27;m not sure if it did anything for me.  I prefered the conditioner in terms of giving me that weightless, soft, shiny finish.</li>
    <li> Love love and love this product so much. I have always been a big fan of shiseido , skincare and makeup, but I have never try the hair product before,  this tsubaki shining set have defienately makes me very happy with the result I have recieved,, so 5 star for this product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  My hair is healthy and shines.  it had become dull and dry, and this product has solved the problem.</li>
    <li> I know there was alot of great veiws on this product but its not for me. It makes ur hair smell like sulfur. It made my hair alittle soft. This product was a waste of my money bc I&#x27;m looking for something that will do wonders to my hair so still searching...</li>
    <li> I have been using Tsubaki since high school. I used the Damage Care line for about two years(or until it ran out) . And it was great. I think it really kept my hair strong and defended against damage throughout those years. However,  I think Tsubaki is not a one size fits all. Being a curly haired girl my current routine uses very little shampoo and a lot of deep conditioning. When I started to use this again the results were not as good as before. I think the reason why is when I started using Tsubaki over 3 years ago, my hair was virgin hair and all I had was heat damage so my ends were a little dry but overall my hair was pretty healthy and strong. It worked GREAT for my hair back then and gave me really good shine and moisture. However, I can&#x27;t use this anyone today because over the last year + I have been dyeing my hair quite a lot, I&#x27;ve bleached it as well. My hair now is more damaged, drier, and needs a different kind of help . Using this shampoo is drying and causes frizz, the conditioner is not that moisturizing either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up,&lt;br /&gt;PROS :&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing for asian hair&lt;br /&gt;- Amazing for virgin hair&lt;br /&gt;- Pretty much will be a godsend to straight hair&lt;br /&gt;- Giant bottles will last you forever&lt;br /&gt;- Heavy scent is good for people who like their hair to smell good.&lt;br /&gt;- This is the cheapest place to buy Tsubaki, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON :&lt;br /&gt;- Curly haired people might get poofy and frizzy&lt;br /&gt;- Can&#x27;t use every time I wash for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;- Strong smell, I really dislike the perfumey smell.&lt;br /&gt;- I use up the conditioner way faster than the shampoo, so will run out of cond. and have a full bottle of shampoo left.&lt;br /&gt;- Can be expensive if you have to buy this very often.(One set lasts me two years easily).</li>
    <li> If your hair is really damaged, the white or gold versions work much better as they are stronger and more concentrated with ingredients.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I usually use (American) salon products like Redkin or Kenra. Having heard that the Japanese do beauty supplies WAY better, I thought I&#x27;d check this out...and they were right. Not only is this cheaper but comes with a lot more product. FURTHERMORE, less product goes a lot further. One pump of shampoo foams a lot and is sufficient every time I clean my hair. Because my hair is fairly long, I find two pumps of conditioner are needed to coat it. Best of all, I get even better shine and my hair is MUCH softer than it was with Redkin or Kenra. I can&#x27;t rave about this product enough.</li>
    <li> I got this is place of my usual Kracie Ichikami and it made my hair incredibly shiny and manageable - I liked the scent as well.</li>
