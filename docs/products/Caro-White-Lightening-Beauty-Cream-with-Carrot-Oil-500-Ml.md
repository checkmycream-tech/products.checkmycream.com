    <li> I love how it smells and feels. Since I just got it today, I have nothing much to say than to wait for weeks or month to see the result, hopefully it will do what it suppose to do. Am mixing it with Carol white small oil, bathing with Carol white soap.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for darker skin people</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!!!</li>
    <li> OMG! Y&#x27;all like bleaching. lol</li>
    <li> Exactly how I expected to be, even bigger. The best so far.</li>
    <li> This product does make your skin soo soft, but I sweat bad after usage as though its clogging my pores.  This happens on any part on my body i use it on. As for the lightening component, I have not been consistent enough to tell. I like the results I got from the kojic acid soap and aveeno natural brightening facial scrub. As for now i am using cerave facial foaming cleanser and for moisturizer I use oil of olay 7 in 1 face cream with spf 30. The crave is really proving to be a wonderful choice, especially if you have eczema.</li>
    <li> it takes about 2-3 weeks before u start to see a change in skin tone but... it works fine... I like it!</li>
    <li> Purchased the lotion first and it was very good.  Not to oily, not too dry or harsh and has a nice smell.  So I decided to give the cream with carrot oil a try and did not see much difference in the consistency. The lotion is not as heavy as the cream and I thought the cream would be more creamier - not an issue and just my personal assumption.  I have a dark mark on my leg and I am applying it everyday.  I am seeing a difference in the color, and it is getting lighter.  I plan to experiment with placing a little on my face for a dark spot and see how that works too.  Hopefully it will work like it did for my leg discoloration. Overall it is a good product and I would order it again.  The price is reasonable and the shipping was  fast and free from the seller.  For under $20 and with consistent use I believe you will be pleased with the results. I use it in the morning and in the evening, the routine/consistent use may play a role in its overall effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
    <li> I use this cream on my arms to clear away uneven skin tone, and it really work on clear it up.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating specically becoz of the handling and shipping of this product which arrived as they had informed me through my email and when I made this order.  Irate them as excellent for shipping this product since I received on the due date. The good thing about it as well u can track your package.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this products to all women/girls who ant to acquire young looking and great skin looking. I love it so much and I ma yet to order another one soon.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product less than a month but the outcome is extremely amazing. Sincerely, this product made my expectation and I am so happy that I was able to get it online.</li>
    <li> Was ok for the price and met my expectations</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time shipping was free great price I will buy from them again. I have been using this caro white lightening cream for a while and it works very well, I have used other fading creams that didn&#x27;t work,caro white lightening cream is very good!</li>
    <li> smells great!!! ive used this for about a week and some days....and its amazing! this clears spots, tones and lightens as well.... its nice.... I ordered four of it so it will last me forever!!!</li>
    <li> The cream is thick and moisturizing. The smell is kind of strong, but pleasant. Would recommend to mix with caro white lotion.</li>
    <li> This product delivers results fast, it removed my most of spots and blemish.  While making my skin looking younger and refreshed.  Thanks for making a great affordable product.</li>
    <li> Very bad smell to this product. I wanted to vomit every time Its opened. I don&#x27;t like it. Not for people who are sensitive to smell.</li>
    <li> The smell was way too strong . Wouldnt purchase again , just wasted my money &amp; seen no results .</li>
    <li> I can see the lighting in my face but it&#x27;s also making my face brake out. I had to look up it up to see if this is good because mine didn&#x27;t come in English. But you include that will make your your face brake out and cause rashes.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I must say I am a mac shade nc45 but I am trying to get rid of a permatan and get a shade or two lighter. This has worked really well so far. My complexion is brighter and blemish free all over. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I find it a little bit greasy for me but not that that much though I just hate even the slightest grease on me lol. It does work though!!  Either way I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: If you are wondering this is by dreams caro white not angel but it works the same.</li>
    <li> Yes this cream has met my expectations By far ! It has been a month and it has began to work on my darker areas around my mouth and my neck . I seen results after the first 2 weeks !!!  My goal was to lighten the dark ares so that my skin can be even , My child notice the change and so did my husband . He ask me everyday if I have makeup on when I don&#x27;t (lol).  I plan to stop In a few weeks once I reach my goal . I recommend this cream for anyone that want to lighten their skin or simply lighten dark areas . 🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
    <li> The standard of Caro White is falling. This cream , orange colour was deeper, now it&#x27;s lighter than before.</li>
    <li> The first couple of uses was fine but then I started itching and my face started breaking out my skin was very irritated</li>
    <li> This cleared my acne and made my skin glow. all my acne scars are gone and I no longer need make up</li>
    <li> Its the strongest product ever.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I have been using it and don&#x27;t see much of a difference...</li>
    <li> It is the best. Go for it.</li>
