      <li>The wider bands seem to work better than the narrower ones.</li>
      <li>Just be sure to use the goop in a well ventilated area</li>
      <li>Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ordering a lot more.  </li>
      <li>or I&#x27;m sure to get a pounding headache.  </li>
      <li>They give you a outstanding non-slip grip that&#x27;s easy on the hand.</li>
      <li>The colors are bright, however it didn&#x27;t stay on very well, had to use Bobby pins to keep it to stay.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and they don&#x27;t stay in</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thinner than I thought, but it&#x27;s comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t slip.</li>
      <li>Not even clips no matter how light they are.  </li>
      <li>These headbands are adorable, and since it comes in many colors, it&#x27;s not hard matching them to my clothes.</li>
      <li>also used them as headbands and true to their name-</li>
      <li>Got these for running, and they do a really good job of holding my hair back--</li>
      <li>Quality is good, and for anyone that doesn&#x27;t have such thin hair I am sure that they would work great.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
      <li>and they aren&#x27;t worth returning.  </li>
      <li>Right now I have it on.</li>
      <li>Nice colors, but have already stretched out after a couple wears.</li>
      <li>I love these to keep my hair back while working out.</li>
      <li>These are so pretty</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased with this product, however, i do not recommend it to people with bangs.</li>
      <li>So if you have coarse hair this product would probably work better for you.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this would work well with fine hair, but I don&#x27;t know about super thick hair.</li>
      <li>At first I was worried that the  glue/rubber on the bottom would rip my hair, but as long as you remove gently and use correctly it is fine.</li>
      <li>These are great headbands, but they are extremely thin.</li>
      <li>Gave the whole lot of em to my daughter.</li>
      <li>I just have a problem with them sliding off unless I put them pretty far forward.</li>
      <li>they stayed in place much better than other headbands I have tried!</li>
      <li>This soft plastic seems to be adhered really well to the headbands because it doesn&#x27;t rub off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far, never has one fallen out of my hair, even druing intense soccer workouts.</li>
      <li>Works great for thin hair, but won&#x27;t hold my thick hair comfortably.</li>
      <li>and I think my head is larger than most other ladies, this may not play in my favor.  </li>
      <li>These are much thinner than I expected and don&#x27;t really stay on my head.</li>
      <li>There is a line of a soft plastic around the inside of the bands and that&#x27;s what makes them \\&quot;No-slip\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Plus, they don&#x27;t really stay to hold back my hair.</li>
      <li>but I gave them to my 8 year old niece</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t read the product description very well and hope to save someone else the same mistake.</li>
      <li>This product would be a 5, except I found that my shorter (5-3 inch) hairs near my forehead hang over the band and have to be tucked in.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with them as they&#x27;re a total waste for me</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine, but also very thick.</li>
      <li>I was a little concerned because I have a larger head, but they still fit really well as long as I&#x27;m not trying to wrap it from my hairline to the back of my neck..</li>
      <li>OK, so I&#x27;ve got long thick hair</li>
      <li>Consequently the whole band frequently slips down the back of my head.</li>
      <li>So thin that even though they have rubber gripping they roll and slide back.</li>
      <li>Maybe check out the 9mm if you have super thick hair.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter&#x27;s hair is fine (but not baby-fine), curly and very, VERY thick.</li>
      <li>However, I do have fine, thin hair</li>

<li> Much too small for my head</li>
<li> they keep slipping back but doable if you don&#x27;t mind readjusting a few times during intense workouts.</li>
<li> The wide ones stay on my head maybe a few minutes before slipping off, but these slip off right away.  </li>
<li> There is a clingy side and a smooth side, but they are so small that I have a hard placing them on the clingy side.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wear things in my hair for long</li>
<li> It will increase your grip 10 fold wiether wet or dry.</li>
<li> That really surprised me because we have a hard time finding headbands that work for her.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve searched for years and spent a lot of money on headbands trying to find one that won&#x27;t give me a headache.  </li>
<li> then I expected</li>
<li> The headbands are way skinnier than I expected, but it hold unlike any headband I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s latex, it can stretch and go back to place, like a rubber band.     </li>
<li> But they are not too expensive so...not too much heartburn when they fall off while she is out and about.</li>
<li> These seem to run small, as if they are for a small child, thus when on they ride up on the back of the head.</li>
<li> I wish they were a little thicker.</li>
<li> These are super thin and get all twisted when you try to put them on.</li>
<li> Too narrow, but that is my fault for not checking the width before I ordered..</li>
<li> I like the Headwraps, but when I received them the white one was broken.</li>
<li> She has lost a few along the way.</li>
<li> I gave them to a friend and she loves them so no huge loss for me at this price.</li>
<li> They stayed in all day and half the night!</li>
<li> I put a small amount of &amp;#34;goop household adhesive&amp;#34; on the tool handle then wrap the headwraps tightly around.</li>
<li> I like how thin these are, but they are always slipping off my head.</li>
<li> Not sure how anyone can use these.  </li>
<li> These do not stay in place, they roll and the fabric side is usually against my hair, not the thin little line of rubber.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s hard to hold these in.</li>
<li> For some reason, hard to find in the stores these days.  </li>
<li> I have thick hair and haven&#x27;t had this problem before.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t have thin hair, nor is it thick, and this fits well with my hair.</li>
<li> They slide off and don&#x27;t hold my hair in place because they are so thin.</li>
<li> Not as thin as I had wanted.</li>
<li> Also very thin.</li>

    <li> Too narrow, but that is my fault for not checking the width before I ordered..</li>
    <li> Right now I have it on. It&#x27;s thinner than I thought, but it&#x27;s comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t slip. Though, it might have to do with the fact that it has some rubber band in them. They smell like rubberbands too. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s latex, it can stretch and go back to place, like a rubber band.     But it keeps hair in place. I use this to just keep my hair out of my face so I don&#x27;t have to keep touching it and making it oily.     I don&#x27;t have thin hair, nor is it thick, and this fits well with my hair. I&#x27;m sure this would work well with fine hair, but I don&#x27;t know about super thick hair. Maybe check out the 9mm if you have super thick hair.</li>
    <li> For some reason, hard to find in the stores these days.  I love these to keep my hair back while working out.</li>
    <li> This is the same review I added on the 9mm headbands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These headbands work amazingly well. I bought them for my granddaughter, and have tried them myself. There is a line of a soft plastic around the inside of the bands and that&#x27;s what makes them \\&quot;No-slip\\&quot;. I also bought some of the thinner no-slip headbands, and they are the same. This soft plastic seems to be adhered really well to the headbands because it doesn&#x27;t rub off at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is baby-fine and the bands hold it. My granddaughter&#x27;s hair is fine (but not baby-fine), curly and very, VERY thick. These bands hold her hair better than they hold mine! That really surprised me because we have a hard time finding headbands that work for her. The wider bands seem to work better than the narrower ones. When the time comes to buy headbands again, I&#x27;ll buy these!</li>
    <li> These are much thinner than I expected and don&#x27;t really stay on my head. They slide off and don&#x27;t hold my hair in place because they are so thin. I think if I got a thicker version I would be happier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, my head is a bit too big for this product. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> These are super thin and get all twisted when you try to put them on. Plus, they don&#x27;t really stay to hold back my hair. I didn&#x27;t read the product description very well and hope to save someone else the same mistake.</li>
    <li> These are fabric covered elastic with a strip of rubber around the inside. Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> Nice colors, but have already stretched out after a couple wears. Also very thin.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend this product. They do slip off my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again. They r also more for teenagers.</li>
    <li> These headbands are adorable, and since it comes in many colors, it&#x27;s not hard matching them to my clothes. However, I do have fine, thin hair and it&#x27;s hard to hold these in. I would recommend having thicker hair or using lots of hairspray if you use these.</li>
    <li> Way too skinny for my fat head! So thin that even though they have rubber gripping they roll and slide back. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I was making a tutu for my toddlers halloween costume and just looped the tulle around the headband.  It worked perfectly for that purpose and now my daughters have tons of elastic no sew tutu&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used them as headbands and true to their name- they stayed in place much better than other headbands I have tried!</li>
    <li> Okay, so here&#x27;s the deal.  I can&#x27;t wear things in my hair for long or I&#x27;m sure to get a pounding headache.  Not with these!!!  I actually forgot I had three of them on at the same time (coordinate).  They stayed in all day and half the night! I know it doesn&#x27;t seem like a big deal to you but it is to me.  I&#x27;ve searched for years and spent a lot of money on headbands trying to find one that won&#x27;t give me a headache.  These do the trick.  I&#x27;m ordering a lot more.  Thank goodness.  No, Not even the slip on headbands work for me.  Not even clips no matter how light they are.  These work.  I wear one, two, three, maybe even four at a time.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The headbands are way skinnier than I expected, but it hold unlike any headband I&#x27;ve ever used. At first I was worried that the  glue/rubber on the bottom would rip my hair, but as long as you remove gently and use correctly it is fine. So far, never has one fallen out of my hair, even druing intense soccer workouts. The colors are a good selection and match many outfits. No dullness or faded color. This product would be a 5, except I found that my shorter (5-3 inch) hairs near my forehead hang over the band and have to be tucked in. Overall, I am pleased with this product, however, i do not recommend it to people with bangs.</li>
    <li> I bought these and the wider ones by Scunci.  The wide ones stay on my head maybe a few minutes before slipping off, but these slip off right away.  I&#x27;m not even sure what to do with them as they&#x27;re a total waste for me and they aren&#x27;t worth returning.  My hair is very fine, but also very thick.</li>
    <li> These are great headbands, but they are extremely thin.</li>
    <li> OK, so I&#x27;ve got long thick hair and I think my head is larger than most other ladies, this may not play in my favor.  These do not stay in place, they roll and the fabric side is usually against my hair, not the thin little line of rubber. Consequently the whole band frequently slips down the back of my head. I&#x27;m constantly fiddling with it. Gave the whole lot of em to my daughter. She can deal with the aggravation.</li>
    <li> I like the Headwraps, but when I received them the white one was broken. otherwise the others fit great and I will continue to wear them.</li>
    <li> Not as thin as I had wanted.</li>
    <li> Sadly, like with most head bands, no slip till means that with out securing these slid off the back of my head when i move my head around. Quality is good, and for anyone that doesn&#x27;t have such thin hair I am sure that they would work great.</li>
    <li> Not sure how anyone can use these.  They come off the head and leave a dent in the skull for hours.</li>
    <li> I wish they were a little thicker. They always fall back and never stay on my head. Colors are nice though.</li>
    <li> I only wish I&#x27;d gotten thicker, beefier ones. I use them on the handles of tools. They give you a outstanding non-slip grip that&#x27;s easy on the hand. I put a small amount of &amp;#34;goop household adhesive&amp;#34; on the tool handle then wrap the headwraps tightly around. It will increase your grip 10 fold wiether wet or dry. Just be sure to use the goop in a well ventilated area</li>
    <li> These seem to run small, as if they are for a small child, thus when on they ride up on the back of the head.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and they don&#x27;t stay in</li>
    <li> I like to have these for a workout. They keep my hair out of my face and they don&#x27;t slide around.</li>
    <li> Got these for running, and they do a really good job of holding my hair back-- there&#x27;s no slip. I was a little concerned because I have a larger head, but they still fit really well as long as I&#x27;m not trying to wrap it from my hairline to the back of my neck..</li>
    <li> My daughter needed a set of head bands to keep her bangs out of her face. These work for her. She has lost a few along the way. But they are not too expensive so...not too much heartburn when they fall off while she is out and about.</li>
    <li> they keep slipping back but doable if you don&#x27;t mind readjusting a few times during intense workouts.</li>
    <li> They are nice that you can combine two colors at a time but they do give me a bit of a headache after wearing it for a while. But nice color variety.</li>
    <li> Very easy to put on, and doesn&#x27;t slip</li>
    <li> I like how thin these are, but they are always slipping off my head. So if you have coarse hair this product would probably work better for you.</li>
    <li> Much too small for my head but I gave them to my 8 year old niece and they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Thinner then I expected</li>
    <li> The colors are bright, however it didn&#x27;t stay on very well, had to use Bobby pins to keep it to stay.</li>
    <li> Works great for thin hair, but won&#x27;t hold my thick hair comfortably. I gave them to a friend and she loves them so no huge loss for me at this price.</li>
    <li> These are so pretty and I wear them to the pool.  I love mixing the colors to match my swimsuits and coverups.  I just have a problem with them sliding off unless I put them pretty far forward. There is a clingy side and a smooth side, but they are so small that I have a hard placing them on the clingy side.  I have thick hair and haven&#x27;t had this problem before.</li>
    <li> They say no-slip... but they slip off instantly.</li>
