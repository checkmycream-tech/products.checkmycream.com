<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just got them in the mail and there is one pattern I got 3 times and one pattern I got two times (balls are broken) so far I found 4 broken balls.</li>
    <li> I hated the fact two were missing from the pack when I recieved them</li>
    <li> Slow shopping but great value!</li>
    <li> Good nice and worth the money I would recommend</li>
    <li> They came earlier than expected. . But I had 2 duplicates exactly the same and one of the belly rings missed the top screw on ball. Worth it though :)</li>
    <li> I was satisfied with the price &amp;quantity of this&lt;br /&gt;purchase</li>
    <li> Disrespectful! three of the balls broke while putting them in 😐👎🏾. Horrible..</li>
    <li> They so cute, plus some of them have there own little design on them. There so cute. Very pleased(:</li>
    <li> Got a few of the same but very nice still..</li>
    <li> they arrived earlier than i expected , i love them , there were some duplicates but over all they fit nice and i love the colors ☺</li>
    <li> I got all 20 pieces but none of them were the ones in the picture. Kind of mad but I still got the piercings</li>
    <li> Got then so early ! Love love love them!</li>
    <li> One came broken &amp;&amp; one came missing a top ball.. Other than that AMAZING &amp;&amp; MADDD CUTE!</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. good durable belly rings but ugly designs but happy.</li>
    <li> i liked these but you get none of what is in the pics</li>
    <li> Not as durable as I imagined they would be but definitely does the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had them for a while now and have not had any problems with them. They seem to be pretty durable and of good quality. There was a nice variety in my package. One or two i didn&#x27;t really like much (solid colors) but that&#x27;s fine for the price! I keep them as backups but it doesn&#x27;t look like i&#x27;ll be needing them any time soon. They also arrived on time and i had no issues with my purchase at all.</li>
    <li> Their nice hover when I received I didn&#x27;t get them all and some were missing</li>
    <li> plastic balls break easily</li>
    <li> Received none of the belly rings that the picture showed. Very disappointed</li>
    <li> Was very pleased with them for the price. My daughter was very happy and now she is wanting to order more.</li>
    <li> You dont get what&#x27;s in the picture. But I like them. I switch them like every 2 weeks or so.</li>
    <li> I love these! I had no problems and it came earlier then I thought it would. None of them were broken and I love the colors. A few repeats in different colors but no two were the same.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re good. The only problem I had was that a few of the smaller balls broke when I went to go screw them on.</li>
    <li> I got the order of belly button rings a few days before it said I was supposed to get them but when they arrived a few of the rings didn&#x27;t have balls on them and that made me really upset. I&#x27;m not sure id buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t that fond of the selection and I had two repeats and about 4 with the same design in different colors</li>
    <li> The belly button rings came earlier than expected and they were all(20) cute and very stylish.  They were bright colors and I love them! I would recommend this purchase to anyone looking for cute belly rings.</li>
    <li> There all very nice but I got a lot of doubles witch I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> I choose this because i havent had no problem with them and havent had to send them back and they are not messed up. Also because the are beautiful.</li>
    <li> I loved them! But one thing is that I didn&#x27;t get the ones I wanted in the picture :(  that really just takes 4 stars sorry</li>
    <li> Came with everything included</li>
    <li> It was a lot that was the same , and one of my balls broke</li>
    <li> The plastic balls tend to break after screwing them on for a few days.</li>
    <li> The piercings was not what I expected at all!!! Totally different from he picture. Looked as if someone painted designs on the belly rings. I would give it zero stars if it was allowed! No bueno!</li>
    <li> They gave me 5 of the same rings and the bars where really small</li>
    <li> Came very fast and none were broken. Got exactly 20 with only 1 repeat which wer my favorites anyway. For those who said they broke when put In alcohol: acrylic WILL BREAK if put in alcohol! Just use warm water.</li>
    <li> It WAS super cute. Until the two crosses fell off a week later. Got delivered to my house in time.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great deal for the quality and quantity of rings. The only thing and maybe I didn&#x27;t see this in the description was some rings had pot leaves on them. Not my thing so I don&#x27;t wear those. Next time I will read more carefully. But an FYI to anyone thinking of purchasing.</li>
    <li> The bars inbetween the jewls are too thin but you can take the jewls off and but them on a different bar</li>
    <li> COLORS are beautiful and different styles, no complaint!!</li>
    <li> I got them on date and I&#x27;m so happy with them!  There beautiful bright colors! And there are so many of them ^.^</li>
    <li> I was very satisfied with my product. There is lots of varietys and I have yet to wear them all.</li>
    <li> The first time they were suppose to arrive, they didn&#x27;t. But after i contacted the seller they sent them out and i received them. They are good because of the quantity and price.</li>
    <li> Really great belly rings for the price</li>
    <li> Recieved them way earlier then the date . They are so pretty .</li>
    <li> They were cute , but medal is rejected by my piercing so , it goes without saing I can&#x27;t really wear these much. Nice quality though.</li>
    <li> I was very dissapointed when I got these. Most of them where of the samething which was of a pot leaf. First of all I do not smoke it or even think that it shouldnt be legal!  I want my money back!</li>
    <li> Love TheM Although I Recieved Repeat Colored</li>
    <li> Wish I wouldve waited to buy these because the new patterns are so cute but the ones I got wasnt that hot in person and I had four duplicates but other than that theyre good</li>
    <li> I love them! They came earlier than expected all 20, I love the colors there was a repeat in design but different colors! None of them have broken. I would recommend this item to anyone. To top it all if it was a great price! It was my first time buying something off of Amazon &amp; I truly don&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
    <li> they were pretty cheap and when i tried to clean it with the solution one broke and the plastic began to rub off. The colors are pretty though . i would recommend this to someone who has the belly button piercing done long enough to not have to clean it,</li>
    <li> got mine today two of the top balls broke :/</li>
    <li> The piercings are really good! Honestly, there was just two things I didn&#x27;t much like from them and it&#x27;s that none of the ones that were in the pictures came in; and that they were small. Other then that they are not cheap, they all came in one piece and the colors that I got were very cute. On top of that, they came in earlier then I thought; I don&#x27;t know why I was so scared for them to come in!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you once more,&lt;br /&gt;-Lisa</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here. The gauge sizes vary. I used one that was too small I guess, and my home closed a whole size. J had to shove my ring through.</li>
    <li> Get what you pay for obviously</li>
    <li> I had a lot of repeats</li>
    <li> They came on time and they are adorable! I love them.</li>
    <li> these broke as  soon as my daughter tried to put them on</li>
    <li> I would give 5 stars but I opened them up to count and make sure they were all there and when I poured them out one of the balls was off of it and I tried putting it back on but it won&#x27;t even twist on so it&#x27;s defective normally I wouldn&#x27;t complain but I paid for 20 so I would like 20 that work properly.</li>
    <li> very nice there so pretty! they came in about 2-3 weeks early. except there was 3 pairs of the same ring and then a set of 3 that was the same.  other wise i really like them</li>
    <li> The bars are too small and not shaped correctly. Horrible.</li>
    <li> Shipping wasn&#x27;t fast. One of my belly rings is missing a ball. Many multiple of colors.</li>
    <li> They came about 3 weeks earlier which I was so excited about. There were a few duplicates which I&#x27;m okay with. They were all very pretty.</li>
    <li> I just got mine and it took from August 18 when I ordered them til today August 27th wasn&#x27;t bad but when I got them they weren&#x27;t the same as the ones I seen in the picture. That disappointed me a little.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there is low ratings but I received these two days ago and am very happy with the purchase! U can&#x27;t beat the price for 20 belly rings. I would highly recommend this purchase. I also received them very quickly.</li>
    <li> Loved the ones I got. Except I got duplicates of 4 of them.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t get the same ones as the color , also mines broke easily , and Also they lost color the second day</li>
    <li> The coloring on the balls doesn&#x27;t come off, which was an issue with other rings.</li>
    <li> Many colors, but bar is very squished. i can&#x27;t use not a one!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get the ones I was expecting from the picture .... and the whole reason I got them was because there were 2 specific ones I wanted out of them.....&lt;br /&gt;But don&#x27;t have them..............&lt;br /&gt;Not satisfied .....&lt;br /&gt;But at least this is cheap...</li>
    <li> I really like the variety it gives you. Some kind of repeat like 1 or 2 times but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Came early and I love them all</li>
    <li> loved them, they are all so nice and seem like they will last a long time. they are cute and stylish!</li>
    <li> 5 were exactly the same and sever others were just alike they were not at all different, the balls actually stripped out quickly too,</li>
    <li> arrived on time and a great selection</li>
    <li> Colors are not all different u get two of each color</li>
    <li> A couple of my belly button rings didn&#x27;t have balls on them</li>
    <li> LOVED these belly button rings! only had 2 balls break on me within 3 years</li>
    <li> Beautiful with NO duplicates.</li>
    <li> Love these belly rings! A lot of colors and variety.</li>
    <li> Wow....got 5 of the same one. Awesomeeeeee. Not</li>
    <li> I love them but I got a lot of doubles.. not too happy about that.</li>
    <li> Really nice, barbells are shorter than regular so they are sort of tight,</li>
    <li> Came a little bit before expected delivery date. None broken when I got them. Good variety. Serve their purpose. One of the ball on one broke but still cool, I mean I had 19 more, lol</li>
    <li> Its was missing some colors that I saw before I ordered</li>
    <li> Arrived on time just what the description said will buy again</li>
    <li> Good quality for the price, perfect bar length, only one repeat, and a nice selection of colors and patterns. I particularly like the striped ones.</li>
    <li> AWESOME!! I contacted the seller because I only received 18 of the 20 pieces. To my surprise within minutes, they replied and had no problem sending me the two that I was shorted. It seemed like just a couple days had passed when I got the other package. Opened it to find not just the two pieces I was originally missing, but A WHOLE NEW SET OF 20!! :-O .They were super nice, very polite and didn&#x27;t question me as if I was lying (I&#x27;ve had this happen before and, its hurtful on a personal level but it&#x27;s also just not good business practice to accuse your customers of lying), the rings were super cute and everything was in good condition. They are made of plastic and a couple of them seem a bit flimsy but for .38c how can I complain?!  And on top of everything else, the initial delivery was speedy as well! 5MILLION STARS!! :D **********&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Pretty colors. Came way before expected. I&#x27;ll def order more. More than 10 were in the bad and the bag that came with it was adorable</li>
    <li> The rings were of good quality but I got a lot of repeated designs. They didn&#x27;t look like on the picture.</li>
    <li> Very nice and good price I woukd recommend this product my daughter will get alot of use from them. :)</li>
    <li> It made my belly hurt really bad I had to take it out</li>
    <li> I love this order!! Although I got a few duplicates, I cant complain for 5$! I would deff recommand!! I was very pleased overall.</li>
    <li> I bought these and i went to sterilize them before using them and half the balls broke in half. Angry</li>
    <li> I LOVE THEM !! they were all different, although I only had 19 and an extra ball instead of 20.</li>
    <li> The balls break very easily! be careful!</li>
    <li> They arrived sooner then expected , I&#x27;ll rate it a 3 because they wasn&#x27;t as cute as I hoped for but they not a big disappointment . I wanted some that looked identical to the pictures shown above 😞</li>
    <li> Very cute pieces the only thing is that I thought I was getting 20 different pieces not 20 of the same pieces. Its basically ten pieces.</li>
    <li> Belly rings came before expected delivery date and were packaged nicely. They have really cute designs, got all 20 &amp; no duplicates of the same exact ones but there are a few of the same patterns in different colors. A lot of pot leaf&#x27;s which I am not thrilled about and the bars are really short. They are cute but feel kind of cheap. But hey, you get what you pay for and it was a good price.</li>
    <li> The top beads break and fall off!!!!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful assortment of colors! Love them all</li>
    <li> NEVER GOT THEM EVEN AFTER 2 MONTHS! SO DISSAPOINTED</li>
    <li> Yes it was amazing👌 even arrived before the original time</li>
    <li> came very great and i love the ones they gave me</li>
    <li> Took to long to come &amp; the wasn&#x27;t clean</li>
    <li> I give this a 4 , because they was supposed to be the belly rings in the picture that&#x27;s why I ordered them and they was about 5 duplicates. And nun out of the pic was with mine</li>
    <li> nice belly rings. was upset to see that not all the ones in the pictures came in.</li>
    <li> Daughter was happy with the selections. Faster delivery than expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even get what I orderd it&#x27;s not what the picture is. There ugly don&#x27;t buy they were just plain boring colors</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re just okay, plastic. And they&#x27;re somewhat ugly and some of them are quite ugly and one would never wear</li>
    <li> Thanks for my order  I was hoping for the colors that you have in the picture but ok.</li>
    <li> They are definitely cheap quality, but that was expected. They work well for short term wear, mainly because the ball falls off before I can wear it for more than a day or two. Pretty good variety, I did not get too many doubles. I only liked a few of them, but for the price it was still a good deal. Like I said, I couldn&#x27;t wear them for a long period without losing the ball so I don&#x27;t know if they irritate or not. But I wore one for a couple days and was fine, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Top beads break ALL THE TIME but you get your moneys worth</li>
    <li> many duplicates and they are really small.</li>
    <li> Love the different styles</li>
    <li> No not really not enough color chocies</li>
    <li> Kind of disappointed didn&#x27;t get any I totally love none of the ones in the pictures and a few doubles but it was fast delivery and some are cute can&#x27;t really bed the price</li>
    <li> Terrible service. Ordered these by accident and they will not give me my money back. The product may be cheap but that is not the point.</li>
