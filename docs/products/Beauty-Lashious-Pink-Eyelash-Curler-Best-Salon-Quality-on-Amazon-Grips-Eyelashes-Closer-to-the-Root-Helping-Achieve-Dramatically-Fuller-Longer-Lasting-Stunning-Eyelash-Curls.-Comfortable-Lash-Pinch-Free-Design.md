<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My old eyelash curler needed to be replaced after years of use and I was pleased to see the Beauty Lashious Curler had a different type of grip since it has always been a challenge getting my fingers in the handle holes of the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I got my new curler and I am very impressed. I absolutely love the way the pink grips fit my fingers and make it so easy to use. After trying it out, I find that it is less likely to pinch than my other eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> I really like my new eyelash curler. The soft cushion on them at the eye is everything. I had a hair that was bothersome all day. Received these after hours of picking at my eye. Im happy to say, I curled my lash up a few times and I can no longer feel that little pesty lash. Will work good with falsies and normal eyelashes of all kind. They even work on my naturally short lashes. But just as wonderful for the my extensions eyelashes. They are so easy to use and I&#x27;m really happy I got them. This handy pink eyelash curler is the perfect  beauty gift idea for any girl/woman.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;My eyelash curler review was given with my unbiased opinion during a promo period.</li>
    <li> does not look anything like picture was just silver with pink handle very dissapointed</li>
    <li> I love this Eyelash Curler. I have been using the same eyelash curler for many years. I am so impressed with this. I like to keep things natural, but love to enhance my eyelashes. I used this without mascara and it made a great difference. (See attached photos) I would highly recommend getting this curler if you want longer looking lashes.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler does a great job at curling my lashes. They are easy to hold and the grip really snugs tight to the lashes and allows the leashes to extend without force or breakage to the lashes. You can see my before and after pics here. The one on top has no curler used but the one on the bottom show the true results of this curler.</li>
    <li> I love my new eyelash curler, with the ergonomic friendly handle it has made curling my eyelashes a breeze.  Don’t let the small handles scare you off, I was a bit amazed when I opened the package, but to my surprise they worked extremely well and my eyelashes look much fuller when I curl them.  I pink areas make them much easier to grip and hold on to.  My daughters have tried to take them from me, as they do with most of my make-up, unfortunately they will have to purchase a pair for themselves because I will not be letting mine go.</li>
    <li> Fully curl lash like the lash sephora cheap but with quality</li>
    <li> This product works well to curl my lashes and is a solid design. And I love the pink color!</li>
    <li> This curler is the best I have found for the price. It curls my lashes very well and doesn&#x27;t pitch the skin around my eyes. This purchase was definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler. I watched a video tutorial on eyelash growing and with the other eyelash curler that I have it did not work at all. With this eyelash curler it gives volume and curls my eyelashes so that I don&#x27;t need my falsies. And I got the pink one, good choice. It&#x27;s super cute. Very durable. Small enough to throw in my weekend bag and go.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It really does curl the lashes upward so they are more visible even before mascara.</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like it that much because it didn&#x27;t curl her eyelashes very well. But thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler has a gentle curved shaped to it that fits perfectly to shape of my eyes.  I&#x27;m able to get close to my lash line and curl all my lashes at the same time.  No pinching or pulling of my lashes what-so-ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the pink touches - handle and eyelash cushion.  Instead of hoops to put your fingers through at the bottom, this one has a little pink handle that your fingers fit comfortably against with a nice spring action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed one bit with this eyelash curler and know that you won&#x27;t be either.</li>
    <li> I must say that I love this eyelash curler! It is very easy to use and curls my eye lashes like a dream! I don&#x27;t have beautiful eyelashes like my husband or kids but after using this eyelash curler I have long beautiful eyelashes.  One of my favorite parts of the eyelash curler is the handle. Instead of the circles that your fingers go in with other eyelash curlers that i have had and used before it has places for your fingers which i find very comfortable and easy to hold on to! it also doesn&#x27;t hurt that it comes with a handle clasp to keep the pads from getting dirty, destroyed or lost (which is one of the complaints i have with other eyelash curlers that i have previously bought) They do not lie when they day that it is comfortable to hold. I also love the color of the eyelash curler. I would highly recommend this eyelash curler to anyone looking to buy one for the first time or just a replacement for the one that they already have.</li>
    <li> I was born with very long eyelashes, so I am constantly trying to keep them going up rather than straight out. I tend to sleep on my stomach and it mashes my eyelashes down and makes then stick straight out. I really like this eyelash curler because it is easy to hold and use, I am one of the girls known for curling my lashes at stoplights. I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about hurting my hands while I try to hurry and get things right before the light changes colors. This eyelash curler does not pull my eyelashes out or bend them at 90 degree angles like other curlers. It fits my eyes just right and I rarely have to redo a lash. I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this eyelash curler during a promotion.</li>
    <li> This is my 1st eyelash curler.  I used it for the first time last night, and didn&#x27;t notice much curl.  It could be me though.  I&#x27;m hoping I get better using it, and it gives me great results.  Stay tuned....  I bought this one b/c of the great reviews.</li>
    <li> Well, it arrived in good time. Honest opinion: the plastic on the handles is rather cheap feeling (the spring-action does not feel cheap, though), the first time I used it I lost 4 eyelashes total (and have lost more each time I&#x27;ve used it over the past week, though I&#x27;m not a rough squeezer), and the curve of it only allows you to get ahold of the middle lashes-  those on the inner and outer corners are ignored. This was a bummer...I&#x27;ve had a cheap Maybelline curler for years and was hoping this would be an improvement, but I&#x27;ve been disappointed. The Maybelline cheapie gets all my lashes curled at the same time, has a comfortable curve to it, and I don&#x27;t notice eyelashes being lost. Pluses and minuses, but I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old one.  Update 1.5 yrs later: I&#x27;m going to have to pitch this...it has removed eyelashes since the beginning, but when it happens every time you use it (once a day, 5+ days a week) it really adds up. I have no replacement strips (and it looks like they don&#x27;t sell any), so it will have to be thrown away. I was hoping to &amp;#34;trade up&amp;#34; with his product, but I wasted my money. It does curl your lashes nicely...the ones you have left.</li>
    <li> These eyelash curlers are sturdy and well made. I love the vibrant color. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t pinch or get stuck as others do. I love that they are easy to use. The eyelash curlers are definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Works great. Fast shipping. Good price.</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how much difference an eyelash curler could make.  I have used several in the past but hadn&#x27;t used one in a few years.  The pink curler from Beauty Lashious is fantastic.  The pink rubber strip adds a nice curl without being harsh on the eyelashes.  I am left handed so sometimes tools of any kind are pretty awkward for me to use.  This one isn&#x27;t it fit perfectly and naturally in my left and right hand.  It is crazy the difference it makes.  I don&#x27;t get &amp;#34;done up&amp;#34; very often , don&#x27;t wear makeup much but mascara is something I never go without.  I usually do two to three coats , I like my lashes to pop.  Curling makes me only need one coat and they look so even and really open up my eyes.  This is a well made eyelash curler.  It is sturdy , comfortable and quality.  I ordered during a promotion at no cost, but if I happen to misplace it , I will order another at full price.  It is worth it.</li>
    <li> These are the first eye lash curlers I&#x27;ve owned and first try I didn&#x27;t pinch. Easy to grip and easy to use. My one complaint is that they don&#x27;t reach my outer most lashes because the curvature is slightly wrong for my eyes.</li>
    <li> I suffer from LED (limp eyelash disease.) it&#x27;s tragic. And until now, I&#x27;ve never found a good eyelash curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch. This thing is incredible. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s different, but it is. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds on expensive mascaras... But they don&#x27;t really work unless you have a good curler. Within the first day of using it, not only was I amazed by the results, but I received countless compliments from coworkers! Seriously, buy this.</li>
    <li> I have used a number of different eyelash curlers throughout my life and I always ended up pushing them aside because they were uncomfortable to use. Then I was given the opportunity to review The Beauty Lashious eyelash curler and I thought why not. I love my lashes to have a curler and fuller look that only comes from using an eyelash curler, so I had nothing to lose. From the minute I opened the package I could see this product was different from any of the products I had used in the past. I loved the pink color of the eyelash curler, it was so girlie!  The handles are made to fit a woman’s hand perfectly. There are no holes to put your fingers in that pinch your fingers or cause them to cramp. The handles are ergonomically designed so they would be comfortable for everyone to use. I noticed while I was placing the curler on my eyelashes there was plenty of room to comfortably place my lashes, but not so big that it grabbed my eye lid. After gently squeezing the curler I felt no pinching or pulling that I had experienced when using other curlers. The curler has a soft pad that fits snuggly in place and did not come out even when I tried using a little mascara. I love the way this awesome curler works and makes my lashes look! I am picky about using any products around my eyes, but this product works so good I will happily use it daily. I do always wipe my eyelash curlers down after every use with a mild soap and water. After cleaning this curler the pad appeared to be just as soft and pliable as it did when it came out of the package. Another note about this product, I was asked to give an honest and truthful review which I have. Also, this company has Fantastic customer service; I have never had a company respond to questions or emails so promptly. What this show me is that they want their customers happy and are proud of their products. I would highly recommend the Beauty Lashious eyelash curler. This would make a great beauty gift for all ages.</li>
    <li> Love the spring action!  Great Buy :)</li>
    <li> I love the color and its wide, but it doesn&#x27;t curl my eyelash very well :( but thanks. My sister keeping it.</li>
    <li> normally i don&#x27;t use eyelash curlers cause they always seemed to damage my lashes but after trying these out i actually do like them. i have had them for a week now and have literally gone from never using eyelash curlers to using it every day. i love these curlers.</li>
    <li> i like it this products because its fit my eyelash&lt;br /&gt;im vey thankful that i have save some of my pocket and thanks a lot</li>
    <li> These are ok, nothing to write home about. I bought new ones thinking they would be great, based on the reviews. The reviews are wrong.</li>
    <li> it is comfortable to use, it works like an average eyelash curler. I used to have a Revlon one, so not that different</li>
    <li> This one is hard to use, pinches my eyes, and does not work any better than the $3 curler from ELF.</li>
    <li> I have alright lashes but they don&#x27;t always flow together. Sometimes I have a couple randoms that are pointing a different direction.  So when I was offered this Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler from Impulseev for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to order one. It arrived and I was able to try it out the next morning cause I definitely had a few out of place lashes. I only pressed them for a few seconds and they went right back in line with the rest of the gang of lashes...lol. I definitely recommend this Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler from Impulseev.</li>
    <li> First time ever to write a review because all the time things have been perfect for me until I got this eyelashes curler... PLEASE DO NOT BUY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cut my eyelashes from the root the first time use! BE AWARE That you will be putting you eyelashes in danger! Which means no eyelashes for a couple of month! TOTALLY MAD AT THIS PRODUCT!!! 😡</li>
    <li> This is no where near the standard of a Shu Umera Eyelash Curler. It rips out one of my eyelashes every single time. Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Great eyelash curler. I was looking for a new one and found this one. I like the pressure. It&#x27;s the first time I tried this type of handle and it&#x27;s actually very comfortable.</li>
    <li> I ordered these on May 1st and they arrived on the 4th...really fast shipping. I bought a pair like this before but it was aggravating because the rubber piece at the top kept coming off. I&#x27;ve used these twice so far and it works just like it&#x27;s supposed to. I like that it&#x27;s made to fit my fingers perfectly so I don&#x27;t lose grip and pink is my favorite color so these are officially my new favorite eyelash curlers. I received a discount on these to test and provide my honest opinion. If anything ever happens to this I would have no problem paying full price for a replacement.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with this baby!!!!!! It is amazing truly one of a kind thank you, thank you. My eyelashes look fantastic I get compliments all the time :) :) :) this eye curler is the best out there. I am impressed and shocked that it works so well. Some friends of mine will be purchasing it too. It makes such a huge difference and the results last all day long. I have thrown everything else and just have this amazing product because that&#x27;s all I need. I am so in love and a customer for life. You guys are the best!!!!!!!!!! I love you....</li>
    <li> Works well, but the hinge at the bottom WILL pinch the skin under your eye/at the top of your cheek.</li>
    <li> If you want your lashes to pop , you need one of this curlers! It does work perfectly, just the right size and easy to use! I did order it through a fantastic deal to share my honest and unbiased opinion. I did apply two coats of my favorite mascara e put it to the test! Wow, my lashes are perfectly curled up and look like butterflies! You just line up with your lashes in and with a soft squeeze you get this amazing effect! I like how the handles are covered and very ergonomic, I am very pleased with mine.</li>
    <li> Works great and I love the finger holds.  Much better than the old fashioned circular ones.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE the Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler! I have short-ish eyelashes and ALWAYS have problems with eyelash curlers pinching my skin or not curling the way I would like them to. The Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler on the other hand has not pinched my skin even once since I&#x27;ve been using it and it curls my eyelashes beautifully and the curl actually last all day long with mascara until you wash your face at night! The grips on this eyelash curler are super comfortable and will allow your hands to do what they need to do without having to worry about your hands slipping. The color is really pretty which also helps this eyelash curler stand out from other eyelash curlers! I would definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> little small for my eyes.</li>
    <li> Works great, fits my eye perfectly!</li>
    <li> Works great with no pinching!!!!</li>
    <li> It works.  I am not used to using these eyelash curlers but this one is easy to use and my lashes are curling.  The one thing that is noticeable is that my lashes appear longer this way.</li>
    <li> works great! curls the lashes and no pinching!</li>
    <li> I love my new pink eyelas cirler. It curls so much better than my old metal one. Thankyou for providing such s wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t pinch &amp; really curls</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever tried. I received this pink eyelash curler free, with a coupon, during a promotion. It&#x27;s very nice and sturdy. It has a spring action working mechanism that feels like it will last forever. It has cute functional finger pieces that makes it easy to hold. The lash pad is also pink and won&#x27;t need to be replaced or fall off halfway through curling my eyelashes. This is a perfect beauty gift for the gal who enjoys pretty eyes but doesn&#x27;t like the hassle of fumbling with the old eyelash curler. It&#x27;s sturdy and easy to use. Love it. I&#x27;m going to purchase several more for the holidays to stick in the stockings of my favorite friends.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, easy to use, and product is &amp;#34;pinch-free&amp;#34; - a definite perk!</li>
    <li> AT LAST FINALLY FOUND AN EYELASH CURLER THAT DOES THE JOB......AND NO PINCHING! I LOVE IT. DON&#x27;T HESITATE, GET ONE. YOU WON&#x27;T BE DISSAPOINTED.</li>
    <li> I like the Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler, but it is a little too compact for me.  That does not mean that it does not do the job, and do it well.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way the handles are made to fit your fingers, it does make it more comfortable than other eyelash curlers, and they are a nice pink color that is very attractive as well.  I do also like the clip that is included to help keep them closed for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It would be great to keep in your travel bag or purse, as it is smaller than other eyelash curlers, which would be a huge plus for some, but I don&#x27;t travel much, so I prefer full size curlers.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, these do a great job and do not pinch like others, and it would be a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
    <li> At first glance, it just looks like a regular eyelash curler. After trying it, I have learned this pink eyelash curler does magic within seconds of using it! It takes just a few seconds on my eyelashes and my eyelashes look more curled and more volume. I am in love with it! I love that it gave me results within seconds. I have tried others in the past where I would even use a blow-dryer to heat up the curler to give me better results. This pink eyelash curler does the trick within seconds without any extra tricks. I have received this product to review, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Very cute...just a little slippery when holding it, but other than that it does its job 👍</li>
    <li> Makes my eyelashes look great, long and luscious.</li>
    <li> The Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler is exceptional!  I love the ease with which it curls my lashes The tool has been constructed well and I love the feature that locks the pads to prevent damage! I appreciate the ergonomic design and the grips! It&#x27;s one of the easier eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve ever used.  I had no trouble with it cutting or breaking my eyelashes off as others did but I did test the sharpness of the tool before I used and so far I&#x27;ve not had any trouble. I love it!</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time and didn&#x27;t disappoint me! Great lash curler,it has a rubberized grip which keep my fingers steady while using it and Because of the rubber padding it helps curling so much easy and worry free from cutting my lashes. Got this as a promotional product. Over all a great buy!Money well spent!!!</li>
    <li> I go through lash curlers like underwear because none do the job! In my search I&#x27;ve spent a small fortune in the promise of gorgeous, big, flirty fan of lashes... blah, blah &amp; so on. Then to my amazement... a winner!!! Could it be? Love this lil&#x27; gadget, it&#x27;s my go~to glam land from here on out...  please don&#x27;t ever stop making them, like never ever!!!... &amp;#34;Serious&amp;#34; lol You will love the sexy, big, wide open baby doll eyes that look so young &amp; playful... meow!! I don&#x27;t care who you are... you can have the best mascara on the planet, but it won&#x27;t do squat without this magician!! A genie it seemed delivered it in a blink of a eye... now fabulous one @ that!! &amp;#34;Wink~Wink&amp;#34; Service, product &amp; price... as you can see I&#x27;m singing it&#x27;s praises to the cosmos!!!</li>
    <li> This is such a unique eyelash curler! I have never seen one shaped like this before. The shape of the handle is such a smart idea because it makes it so that it fits into your hand perfectly and you are much less likely to slip. It&#x27;s very easy to hold this curler very close to your lash line. The little pad is designed so that you won&#x27;t pinch your skin as you curl. I think this would be a great tool for beginners.You can also really tell it is built to last. I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I recieved the Beauty Lashiou pink eyelash curler to try. I absolutly love it. It makes a big diffrence in the apearance of my eye lashes.  I highly recommend it.👍</li>
    <li> Not sure if these are any better than drugstore eyelash curlers...they curl but it&#x27;s not a totally comfortable fit for my eyes. (My eyes are larger than average, so perhaps that&#x27;s the reason?) They are not flimsy at all, and clamp down smoothly.</li>
    <li> So far this has been the best eyelash curler I have bought.  It was a little more but then I have bought so many of them because I never had that problem before until I went to a professional to try and curl my eyelashes and never worked but instead damaged them so when I saw this eyelash curler on Amazon I thought I might as well try it also and so far I have been very happy with it.  Thank You, Ilene Gonzales, Elko, NV  89801</li>
    <li> Not worth it. I purchased a better eyelash curler at the Dollar Tree store</li>
    <li> The very best thing about this eyelash curler is it&#x27;s grip design. I was suprised when my sample to review arrived that the grips were very effective for curling lashes. I hadn&#x27;t really given it much thought previously just how awkward finger loop grips are when working in such a delicate area. It&#x27;s taken a bit of retraining but using this type of handle is much easier on my carpal tunnel syndrome hands, much steadier. The curl aspect is very good, once I learned the right angle to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think these are very much worth a try and I love mine, even though I was unusure at the beginning.</li>
    <li> I like the handle and it does an awesome job curling my lashes</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler!  The handles are very easy to hold on to.  What I love the best is the size!  It fits perfectly inside my make-up bag.  And who doesn&#x27;t love pink! The curler part is great too and definitely makes a difference in my lashes.  Will definitely recommend this one to all my female friends!</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler is nice but does not seem to work any better than ones that I have used in the past. I will be curious to see how it holds up the material does seem to be more resistant to indentations when curling.</li>
    <li> Very nice helpful and useful.</li>
    <li> Just prefect! Sturdy and a good price!</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler!  FINALLY an eyelash curler that is compact but yet sturdy enough to fit in my makeup bag. The handle makes it easy to hold for longer than the other eyelash curlers with metal loops. It works like a dream and I love the pink!  So glad I decided to buy this.</li>
    <li> Loved this!!! Received in superb packaging (see pic). Product is a lovely pink and doesn&#x27;t pinch your eyelashes when you curl them. the Round holes here you place your fingers to sqeeze were replaced so you don&#x27;t have to uncomfortably fumble to get your fingers in. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this discounted price. provided to me for an unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> Great just like all lash curlers are!?</li>
    <li> Do not buy this eyelash curler! The pad is split in half after only a couple of weeks use. This caused my eyelashes to get caught inside and get ripped out!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the quality of this. I love how the grips are for your fingers.  Makes it easy and comfortable to use. Curls lashes like a dream!</li>
    <li> I Love these! Very easy to use! Never pinches me. I was so surprised that these actually don&#x27;t pinch no matter what. I hate the other eyelash curlers that would pinch me every time I used them. These never do that. They are also really cute and stylish. I got the pink ones. I love the way they look and feel. They are comfortable in my hands and easy to hold. They curled my eyelashes very well. I am impressed with this eyelash curler! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Having a really good quality eye lash curler is very important to me because If you guys dont know, a lot of cheap curlers can easily snap and break. You dont want that metal poking in your face and damage your eyeballs!!!!!! Cheap or bad quality curlers can also cut your eyelashes hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving this product, I inspected the way it&#x27;s made first before trying it on my eyelashes. The curler does not have a spring like some curlers do. It open and closes very smoothly. Personally I like that it has a little bit of resistance because I can control the &amp;#34;curling/pinching&amp;#34; part. The handle is very unique too! If you are confused why its designed that way, I tell you what, my fingers has never been relaxed while curling my eyelashes. My thumb, point and middle finger sits on that handle perfectly it almost like it&#x27;s molded specially for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tested it on the tip of my hair first before trying it on my eyelashes, just to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t cut. Passed that test and I am loving it already. I curled it for about good 10 seconds and it really curled the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I tested it on my eyelashes and the result is really good! It curls like it&#x27;s supposed to, it curls most of my lashes from end to end, and it doesn&#x27;t snag any hair out so that&#x27;s very important. It&#x27;s amazing what a good quality curler (also a good mascara) can do to make your eyes look bigger and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am loving this new curler. Very comfortable to use, great resistance, glides smottly, no cutting eyelashes hair and its made well. Oh it also comes with a little clip that keeps your curler closed when unused. That&#x27;s really neat as long as you dont lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thing that would have been great is for it to come with extra rubber pads. You know them pads are gonna get dirty from the mascara!  But other than that, this is a great product and I highly recommend it. I posted some photos, hope they are helpful to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***i got this product at a discounted price in return of my honest and unbiased review. I love the curler so it deserves a 5 star. If it breaks or something, i&#x27;ll definitely update but so far it&#x27;s really nice!***&gt;***i got this product at a discounted price in return of my honest and unbiased review.

    <li> Fabulous and easy to use!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this because of its raving reviews but have not been impressed AT ALL! The finger grip is nice but that&#x27;s about the only thing that is better than the cheaper ones in the grocery store. If I held it super tight and for more than 10 seconds, it would curl ok but it never lasted. I have never had the curl in my lashes fall out so fast, it was very strange. I can usually get my curlers to last at least six months but. Had this one for maybe a month when it started to kink my lashes weird, it also started to yank my lashes out (see my pics). I have tried a ton of different types and this one is probably the worst. Save yourself some time and go with a different brand, I wish I would have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and it doesn&#x27;t come with a replacement pad. LAME.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is different from other eyelash curlers I&#x27;ve used previously. The handle has contoured groves for your fingers to rest in versus a circle cutout. The circle cutout eyelash curlers require you to manually open and close the curler to use it which Beauty Lashious&#x27;s Pink Eyelash Curler has a tension spring in it so that it opens on its own and you only apply force to close it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This removes the clumsy awkward feeling that traditional eyelash curler handles have. Traditional eyelash curlers feel like using kids scissors, they just aren&#x27;t comfortable but Beauty Lashious&#x27;s Pink Eyelash Curler feels natural in your hand and there are no discomforts involved in using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One claim made by Beauty Lashious&#x27;s Pink Eyelash Curler is that it offers &amp;#34;PINCH-FREE CURLS&amp;#34; This claim is true. When you press down on the curler handles the pads that curl your lashes don&#x27;t pull, tug, or pinch. It&#x27;s soft and pain free. I read other reviews that claimed this curler cut their eye lashes but I&#x27;ve not had that experience. Another reviewer posted a photo of their curler and cut eyelashes and this curler doesn&#x27;t match the way my curler looked. I purchased mine June 2015; picture attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how well this curler curls my eye lashes. I don&#x27;t think it curls any better than any other eye lash curler I&#x27;ve used but it is as effective and meets my needs and expectations. I&#x27;ve included some of my before and after pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR&lt;br /&gt;This curler does have a higher price point than say your dollar store eye lash curler. In my opinion if you are looking for a curler that has a comfortable, ergonomic, tension released handle this curler is perfect for you. This curler has the added bonus of being pinch free. If you are just looking for a curler that curls without all the extra perks than go for a cheaper curler. You can achieve the same curl results with a low quality curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler complimentary in exchange for an honest review.

    <li> Definitely have used better curlers.  Only okay for me.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve always gotten a lot of compliments on my eyes because of their aqua blue color and my long lashes, but as I&#x27;ve gotten older I&#x27;ve noticed that my lashes weren&#x27;t as full.  I tried using different lash curlers but nothing really seemed to bring about a significant change and often times causing discomfort and actual loss of my lashes.  When a friend mentioned how much she loved a new lash curler she had recently tried I figured I&#x27;d give it one last try and wow, I am so glad I did.  Impulseev&#x27;s Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash curler is the polar opposite of all the  others I&#x27;ve tried.  First off, the handle is shaped so that you can get a proper grip on the curler, molded to allow for 2 finger placement.  The pink pad on the curler itself keeps the curler from crimping your lashes, leaving a perfect, natural looking arch every time, plus the pad is soft and pliant and doesn&#x27;t pull at or pluck those lashes.  And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, Impulseev has taken it a step further and included a secure handle clip which keeps the curler closed while in your makeup bag, because after all ladies, do we really want a mucked up lash curler anywhere near our eyes????  I was never a big fan of lash curlers before &amp;#34;discovering&amp;#34; this one and simply won&#x27;t leave home without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> It is too big for my eyes so I can not get all of my lashes in the curling part.</li>
    <li> Although purchased at an incredible discount, this was not what I ordered.  This curler looks cheap, and I won&#x27;t be trying it.</li>
    <li> I have never had an eyelash curler that had these type of grips before. I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it when I saw it. But as soon as I tried it, I realized how much I HATE those little rings that seem to get stuck on my finger if I push it on too far. These open-type seem to give you more control, but still have a natural motion to use them.  I did find that the curler seemed to be a little taller than my old one, and I ended up hitting my brow bone a little on the inner corner. It may just take some time getting used to a new one. I did like that the little strip seemed softer than my old curler. With my old one, I felt like I really needed to push to get the curl, this one curls more easily. I have also read that you are supposed to use eyelash curlers by placing lashes and then lifting the tool so it is more horizontal to the ground, then squeeze. I have had no luck with that method and just use it in a more vertical manner. Maybe if your eyelashes are VERY straight or even point slightly downwards, you might find you need the bigger angle to curl them and like the horizontal-squeeze.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler; I have not owed many of them but this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve had. I bought it because of all the great reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday all week and I have not had any problems, very easy to use, has a nice grip that&#x27;s easy to control giving opportunity to as much necessary pressure to curl my eyelashes as much as I  would like.  Depending on how long it lasts I might keep buying, this might be a great gift.</li>
    <li> Great product - I like that it is less &amp;#34;clunky&amp;#34; than others, and is easy for me to use with my makeup glasses with fold-down lenses that these presbyopic eyes need now. I also appreciate not having a small product arrive in a large box with a ton of non-recyclable filler.</li>
    <li> This pink eyelash curler is the cutest thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I&#x27;ve never seen one without the scissor-like holes to put your fingers in so I wasn&#x27;t certain if I&#x27;d like this one, but let me tell you, it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever used.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking around for a eyelash curler that did not have metal handles since they don&#x27;t feel to well when using them and I finally did!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler has the perfect handles on them. They are made of metal with plastic handles that form to your fingers and don&#x27;t hurt when using. It&#x27;s amazing how changing the handles would feel once you use them. There is such a big difference to me.&lt;br /&gt;The Eyelash Curler is wonderful!!!! It makes my eyelashes beautiful and long and I don&#x27;t have to keep using it over and over again. I get up in the morning and put my make up on,use the Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler and walla that&#x27;s it for the day:) I always hated having to use one constantly while out with friends.&lt;br /&gt;The Curler also doesn&#x27;t pinch,which is another feature I love. I always hated that with my other ones,but this one works perfectly!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the Curler and continue to use it forever as will my daughter,she thinks when I get something she gets to use it:) Teenagers lol.&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little or no cost to me to provide my honest feedback and that is exactly what I have done. I hope you enjoy yours as much as we are enjoying ours:)</li>
    <li> When I was offered this Beauty Lashious Pink Eyelash Curler complimentary to test and review, I jumped right on in because it looked like something that I had never used before. This is very affordable and well structured device and I love how it had the handle spaces for your fingers (left or right handed) and it fits well with my hand making eyelash curling so much easier. With past products I used to get pinched with the curler and no matter how many techniques that I tried I couldn&#x27;t get away from that painful experience so I had basically given up on curling my lashes and resorting to expensive curling mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then this came into my life. As soon as it was delivered I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. It was so easy to use and it didn&#x27;t pinch. Wait? What? No pinching? Count me in. I curled my eye lashes without mascara on and saw an amazing difference and decided to use a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; mascara (one that wasn&#x27;t formulated for curling). I did notice that curling my lashes before the mascara wasn&#x27;t going to work so I had to take 20 seconds to curl them again but no big deal! The curl lasted all day and didn&#x27;t damage my lashes. I really love this product and I wish I would have found it sooner!!!</li>
    <li> This shipped super fast I love the pink color it&#x27;s so pretty.  These don&#x27;t have a million buttons to push- just your standard eyelash curlers.  I have used these everyday- while they don&#x27;t make your lashes crazy amazing they do work.  The main thing for me is practicing with them. I love makeup but I&#x27;ve never quite mastered the eyelash curler. It was important for me to learn to use them with one that wasn&#x27;t difficult to operate. These are quite simple you open them and apply to your lashes then close down -wait then release.  This may deserve a 5 star later down the road but until I&#x27;ve mastered the technique and gotten even better results I&#x27;m giving it 4.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for my short lashes. I tried all kinds of lash curlers before, it doesn&#x27;t work on my. But this one does. I don&#x27;t like fake lashes so i&#x27;m so happy i got these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is so nice too, it has a nice grip.</li>
    <li> My new Pink Eyelash Curler is my new favorite!  I am loving how easy it is to use and the spring hinges are a huge help so I do not pull out any eyelashes! This was a great new addition to my make-up bag!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is not as described or pictured.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great  price and does a good job of curling your lashes.  I&#x27;ve always used the mac curler in the past and this one fits my eyes a little differently.  Just an adjustment on my end i&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> My new favorite  my eyelashes looks so full .. Must have !</li>
    <li> What a great product I have been looking for a quality Eye Lash Curler for a long time and I finally found it in this product, you will not find a set that is easier to use than these. In a matter of seconds my eye lashes looked awesome! These are affordable and work so well that they would rival the most expensive Eye Lash Curlers! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE AND ALL OPINIONS ARE MY OWN</li>
    <li> I am so happy I bought this eyelash curler. I have very straight lashes and no other curler could curl my lashes like this pink eyelash curler . I just press it down for 5 seconds and it instantly curls my lashes! Definitely recommend buying this curler! It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Seriosuly makes your eyelashes super curled and with that they will look longer!</li>
    <li> I have fairly long eyelashes but as I age they are thinning out.  I normally curl my eyelashes to make them look a little fuller instead of using mascara.  I was really excited to try this curler but was somewhat disappointed.  It did not curl my eyelashes very well compared to the Revlon one I have been using for years.  Maybe it is because my eyelashes are thinning or because they are longer?? I know a lot of others love this curler but it was just not for me.</li>
    <li> Free Product provided for evaluation and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was packaged so it was easy to open.  It’s a white eyelash curler. The curler base that’s curved is large enough to cover my eye lashes well.&lt;br /&gt;I’ve heard if you heat these up they work better so sometimes I sit mine on my heater to warm it up a bit. This one seems to work about the same either way - heated or not.&lt;br /&gt;It should not pinch if you are careful using it. I think this one could pinch just like about any of them could if used improperly, though it does have a nice rubber base.&lt;br /&gt;I do like to use them- curling my lashes makes my eyes look bigger and my eyelashes look a lot longer.  The curl holds too.  I curl mine first, then apply mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I think the main advantage of this one is the really tight squeeze and comfortable handle.</li>
    <li> Great for putting on fake lashes and curling them works great on curling my own lashes as well. These are very well made and the grop of these are awesome my fingers don&#x27;t slip great gripping.&lt;br /&gt;The Best Ever</li>
    <li> I have been using eyelash curlers for sometime now and love how my eyelashes look after I use the curlers. I however do think that some curlers are not as comfortable as others. They either pinch, pull or crimp or just plain uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler by beauty-lashious is perfect. Not only is it compact, it does the job perfectly. Just place the curler near the base of the&lt;br /&gt;eyelash, press and hold for 10-15 seconds. Repeat on the other eyelash. The process does not take more than a minute for both the&lt;br /&gt;eyes together. The curler also has soft cushion so that you don’t get hurt or pinch yourself accidently. The curl also last the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the design of the handle, not to mention the hot pink handles. I love it so far and definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample received.</li>
    <li> There are several things I like about this eyelash curler.  The main one being the handles. They are soft and thick so they are very comfortable to use and they don&#x27;t hurt my fingers like some other curlers have. I&#x27;ve used some that felt like they were digging into my knuckles even if I barely squeezed them.  These are not like that at all.&lt;br /&gt; The shape itself is great also.  They fit very comfortably in your hand and the built in grips keep it from slipping when you are using them.  I also like that they are smaller than other eyelash curlers.  I feel like I have more control when I&#x27;m using them and they are easier to store in a smaller makeup bag or your purse. The pads on the curler are very comfortable too.  They grab onto the eyelashes firmly but they do not pinch or pull them at all.  It&#x27;s bad enough that eyelash curlers look like torture devices anyway, but when they hurt to use, that&#x27;s unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;  I got a fantastic curl from this Beauty Lashious Eyelash Curler that lasted all day.  I don&#x27;t recommend putting on your mascara before curling though.  I know a few girls that do that but you can always tell because it causes the lashes to clump together and keeps them from looking natural.  Curl them before applying mascara and you will get a &amp;#34;wide eyed and bushy tailed&amp;#34; effect. (As my grandma used to say)  It really does make your eyes look less tired and it wakes up your entire face.  I seriously think an eyelash curler is one of the most important tools in a ladies makeup bag for that very reason.&lt;br /&gt;I received this in exchange for a review, but all opinions are strictly my own and based on my own findings</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I rarely write reviews for products, but this time I feel I have to. I have been using eyelash curlers for years so I am not new to the concept or technique. This eyelash curler ripped half my lashes right off. I placed the curler on my lashes and upon closing the pink cushion (the part you replace)  slipped off its track taking half my lash line with it. The pain was unreal and I instead of curled lashes I am left with a huge bald spot on my lash line not to mention a swollen lid. Now I have to wait several weeks for my lashes to grow back and will have to wear fake eyelashes because the bald spot is super noticeable. The design is poor and unstable. Spend your money on a better quality and better designed tool.</li>
    <li> Absolutely it  doesn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
    <li> Great eyelash TWEEZER...I mean curler...NOT!!!!! It ripped almost ALL my eyelashes out! Check out the pics!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is okay, but I&#x27;m not really sure why it&#x27;s had such rave reviews. It gets the job done, but not without some flaws. For some reason, the curler fits my right eye just fine, but not my left. Maybe this is because I&#x27;m right-handed and reaching my hand across my face, but I&#x27;ve never had this issue with an eyelash curler before. My fingers have slipped off the handle on more than one occasion, at least one time popping myself in the eye with the curler. Your eyelash curling experience probably shouldn&#x27;t be dangerous or traumatic, just sayin&#x27;. I&#x27;m hoping the pad holds out since it didn&#x27;t come with any replacements. All in all, it&#x27;s a decent product, but not great by any means.</li>
    <li> Awesome product ..did a amazing job on my lashes</li>
    <li> This curler was too big for my eyes, so I couldn&#x27;t even curl them :(.  I didn&#x27;t think that I have small eyes, I have normal sized eyes and my Revlon eye lash curler worked fine.  I wanted to try a better eyelash curler, I thought this would be it from the reviews, but not so much, sad :(.</li>
    <li> Love it works like a charm &amp; doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt me in the least!!!!</li>
    <li> Have to be careful as it is so strong it can pull out lashes easier than the target ones but does hold all day</li>
    <li> My girl likes it, that&#x27;s all that matters :)</li>
    <li> Love and pink! Works great</li>
    <li> I guess you get what you paid for. This is a cheap, low quality, made in China curler.  It wasn&#x27;t as described disappointed.</li>
