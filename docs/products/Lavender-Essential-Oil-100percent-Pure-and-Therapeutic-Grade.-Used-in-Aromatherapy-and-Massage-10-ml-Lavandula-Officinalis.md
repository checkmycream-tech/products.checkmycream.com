<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product worked great for the reason I purchased it...to help calm my anxious shelter dog. For real. Big bonus for me is that it smells great, is highly concentrated so only a tiny bit is needed to rub under his dog bed about once a week. His reaction was almost instantaneous, settling in with a big sigh and finally fell asleep. It certainly helped us to help him through this rough period.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell.  Sensual and relaxing.</li>
    <li> I like this Lavender better than the Young Living oils and the price is much more affordable.</li>
    <li> The uses are endless! I use it on my pulse points and smear a little under my nose for instant relaxation. My secret bathroom weapon is a couple of drops in the toilet prior to &amp;#34;using it&amp;#34;. The only lingering scent is that of fresh lavender!!</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of the lavender oil, one to keep in my kitchen and one for my bedroom.  I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this product.  A few drops sprinkled on my pillow before bed helps me relax.  And I use some in a spray bottle to help keep both the insects at bay and to freshen the air from dog and cooking odors.</li>
    <li> Great quality n so happy it organic. Nice price as well.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Item arrived quickly, quality is great!  I&#x27;ve used it in everything from laundry to bath salts.</li>
    <li> Smells perfect. Took a bath with it, added just a few drops and was in heaven. I plan to put a drop or two on my pillow cases for sweet dreams. Love it! Got to me very quickly as well and was wrapped very protectively.</li>
    <li> This Lavender Oil has such a fresh sweet scent! It&#x27;s like holding a freshly picked bunch of blossoms up to your nose! I never really cared that much for the scent of lavender (up until now), I do love the many medicinal and healing properties  of lavender, the scent just never really thrilled me. That has changed!  WellnesScent Lavender is just wonderful, it opened up a new world of appreciation for this fragrant flower!  I can&#x27;t wait to sample your other essence oils. Thank you for such an outstanding product!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brand of lavender essential oils. I bought one about a year ago and loved it, but I decided to try another brand that was cheaper and came with more...not worth it! It smelled like Lysol! I am back to this brand and am so happy. Very quality product.</li>
    <li> It was everything i wanted it to be: high quality and economical!  I will order it again!</li>
    <li> smells as good as any other high priced version.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I got it. Thank you. It is great.</li>
    <li> Fabulous clean scent.</li>
    <li> My husband actually bought this excellent lavender oil for me.  I&#x27;m a certified massage therapist and I use a LOT of essential oils in my practice. Many over the years have been pretty bad quality but WellnesScent, to my happy surprise, is excellent and very potent. It has an intensity and an aroma that has to be smelled to be believed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like he way the bottle is labeled because it makes it easy to find in my case, which is an extra bonus. The way WellnesScent packages their product looks great and keeps it fresh as well, which is important with any essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you work with lavender or any other essential oil I can only say that WellnesScent has the best I&#x27;ve seen in almost 15 years.  I&#x27;ll be trying more of their products soon that&#x27;s for sure. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great in calming my two kids. I mix it with coconut oil for massages and lotion. I also put a few drops in a misting bottle with water. The kids love spraying themselves with it and it works great to spray in their hair to fix bed head!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of lavender, I add this to my unscented lotion and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful I use it about everyday it does relax me a friend recommended this because I have insomnia it actually does help. The price is great for what you are getting and I love and appreciate the e-books they send me. I want to try more oils and I will only order from wellness. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Love this added to Epsom Salts bath</li>
    <li> This product has fatastic smell and lasts quite a long time.  Would highly reccommend</li>
    <li> Smells better then Do Terra, and much cheaper!</li>
    <li> Was not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Very calming scent. A couple of drops in the bath water will do.</li>
    <li> Smells great and was delivered quick!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to essential oils and am very pleased with your lavender oil. So far I&#x27;ve used it in kitchen and bathroom defusers, added it to fabric softener for heavenly sheets, and am finding more uses all the time. Have just ordered peppermint and tea tree oils.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell! I&#x27;ve added it to homemade cleaners and my bath water (along with some epsom salt).</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying essential oils.  I made several Christmas gifts from this - such as lavender soaps and bath salts.  After reading up on it, I also used it on my dryer sheets, in candle wax, on cotton balls for room fresheners.  The smell is fantastic!  Buying some more today!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I came so quickly.  I bought it to make a fresher for curly hair and it works wonderfully.  Thanks to the e-book I also use it for Sleeping, the scent is very relaxing.  Can&#x27;t wait to try some of the other ideas in the e-book.  I will certainly buy from this company again.</li>
    <li> Great smelling pure oil.  Looking up essential oils can be overwhelming.  There are thousands.  I went with this one based on the reviews, and it&#x27;s a winner.  I use a few drops in my humidifier, an my house smells amazing.  My husband even likes it!</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I use it in a diffuser in the office and everyone comments on how nice it smells.</li>
    <li> I have never used essential oils before, and I bought this (along with some Rose Hip oil) for relaxation. I have been using them in the bath, as well as putting a few drops on my pillow before bed, and they have really worked wonders with helping me to fall asleep! I&#x27;ll put about 10 drops of oil into the bath (along with some epsom salts) after a long day, and when I get in bed shortly after, I feel so incredibly relaxed and fall asleep super easily. I normally have difficulty falling asleep, so this has been wonderful!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand based on the reviews. My first experience with an essential oil has not been disappointing. Wonderful smell. Will definitely order this brand again</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she has a bear that you heat up and it smells like lavender to help you sleep. The smell has gone out of the bear, so I used this to reinvigorate the smell. Smells so lovely and calming. Very happy with the scent.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that the lavender scent was not as strong as the scent of the oil that it is mixed with. I have since ordered a bottle from a different company.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the Lavender Oil I received.  I put a drop or two into my infuser and it smells so good.  I would recommend this product and others from WellnesScent.</li>
    <li> GREAT product! Such a great value and very strong, pure smell!  I put in a spritz bottle with water to spray on my children at night.  Works awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with my oils and I used it in conjunction with another oil and the result was amazing!  I&#x27;m convinced!</li>
    <li> Instantly became our favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lavender essential oil for 17 years now. This has to be the worst one I have ever tried. It has a very strange odor to it. It definitely smells off, like something has been added to it.</li>
    <li> I love the calming effects of lavender essential oil and rub a drop on my hands and on my pillow at night to help drift off to sleep. I also dab it on mosquito bites to help stop the swelling and itching.  I am pleased with the quality of this 100% pure essential oil and will order again.</li>
    <li> This is pure, wonderful lavender oil! Not watered down like some others. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Lavender has a very calming effect on me, and this undiluted product will last me for quite some time. I use it for aroma therapy for sleep, meditation and for the warmth its scent adds to my home work space. I know I will use it in the future to ease muscles after workouts. Good quality.</li>
    <li> use it on my bed pillow, ahh relaxing</li>
    <li> Great lavender oil...I use it on Woolies Dryer Balls and it worked perfectly.  Very tiny so I went through the bottle quite quickly but loved the end result of my laundry nevertheless.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lavender oil.  Knots in muscles relaxed!  And WellnesScent, as a company, exhibits caring and informed business practices.  Plus, their e-books are great.</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil for about 8 months now. I use it at night to help me sleep and it works wonders! I rub a little on the bottom of my feet and on my wrists and within 20 minutes I&#x27;m out!</li>
    <li> This is my second order...absolutely divine. I keep the first empty bottle at my desk, uncap and take a whiff just to enjoy the lingering aroma.  I put a few drops in my bath water with Epsom salts (for the magnesium)  for a truly relaxing and calming bath.  Trouble with my ticker has me looking for all kinds of ways to reduce stress, this one fills the bill.  Will never be without.....no hesitation here, purchase, and  enjoy. Update: 1/2016 I continue to reorder and my husband and I continue to enjoy it.  Service was prompt and the product was carefully packaged for safe delivery.</li>
    <li> The smell is too intense. I question whether or not some synthetic fragrance has been added.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Using it with diffuser to create calming scent and have used with coconut oil for skin.    Fast delivery. Liked the informational pdf flyer.  Wish the dropper did a better job dispensing drops--it just streams out.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Relaxing. Not cheap.</li>
    <li> Great deal for great quality.</li>
    <li> Great high quality oil. Awesome customer service. E-book is very informative.</li>
    <li> Very nice with a  great strong fragrance.  Will do business again.</li>
    <li> This lavender Oil is the best I have ever purchased. When I first saw the bottle, I didn&#x27;t think the oil would last long but I was wrong.  It is so concentrated that it takes less drops in my bath water then other oils I have tried. Two to three drops in a large tub of hot water gives me the aroma I want and my skin is nice and soft when I get out of my bath. It really amazes me that it doesn&#x27;t make my marble tub slipper like other oils have.  To me that means that my body is absorbing the oil instead of leaving it on the sides and bottom of my bath tub.  I liked the way it was packaged because all of the liquid stayed in the bottle.  I, also, like to freshen my sheets with a couple of drops too. My husband has no problem falling to sleep.</li>
    <li> Fantastic oil. Worked great for my migraines! Also helped my teen to relax. Highly recommended purchase. Fast shipping, and great price!</li>
    <li> helped me sleep peacefully every night!</li>
    <li> Used a drop in my mascara :)</li>
    <li> The lavender oil arrived promptly.  I use it at bedtime to help me sleep.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  Much better than taking Benadryl or an over the counter sleeping aid.</li>
    <li> Smells good and is very soothing.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent!  I like to use it in my bath for relaxation and soft fragrant skin.</li>
    <li> THIS is the best! I love the smell of the oil. Great quality! I smell it every night to relax. Very soothing!</li>
    <li> I love this EO.  WellnessScent is my new found supplier. Ship time is fastest I&#x27;ve ever had. The product is superior by far.</li>
    <li> I found the scent strong and slightly off for my sense of smell.</li>
    <li> This is only my second bottle of lavender, but I must say I think this one smells better then my previous bottle (from a different manufacturer).  The item arrived quickly and seems to be of good quality.</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is amazing, it smells great and worked amazing on my nosr piercing, I put it in everyday :)</li>
    <li> I love this oil It smells great, lasts long- will by again! Wasn&#x27;t sure - happy I took a chance</li>
    <li> as described, but not exceptional</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone who is going thru Chemo and it was suggested to help with the body aches while in treatment to soak in a warm tub of  water  in which you will add Epsom Salts scented with Lavender Oil....very soothing and is helping.</li>
    <li> amazing quality to this Lavender oil.  I use it when I go to be at night.  Only need a wee bit because of the quality.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Smells wonderful and I wake up feeling refreshed. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I use it in my LiteMist Oil Diffuser. Smells like lavender, works in the diffuser, so I have no complaints. Happy customer especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this oil in a bath with Epsom salts for soaking sore muscles and relaxing.  It is a very fragrant, high quality oil. It was a great price and equal quality to what I have purchased in the local health store.</li>
    <li> I use this to make deodorant.  Usually the alcohol I use for the deodorant overpowers the lavender a great deal and need to use a lot of oil.  This oil has a strong lavender smell and I was able to use half the oil I usually use.  It’s great.</li>
    <li> I use this product perhaps somewhat differently than others, I add it to the pre-shave oil I mix for myself. Over the last few years I have triesd a number of different essential oils to add an aroma to my oil, this product works significantly better than others, not just because it was less expensive.</li>
    <li> Nice lavender smell, oil goes a long way with just a little bit.  Would recommend, good buy!</li>
    <li> I have just started using this product and cannot say yet with any assurance that it does what I want it to do. I ordered it for use before going to bed and dab it on my temples and the pulse point on my neck. I like the smell and think it is relaxing, so perhaps it works that way. I did get a light rash on my neck the other day, but I am not sure if the oil caused it or if I had an allergic reaction to something. Time and continued use will tell.</li>
    <li> This is my first Essential Oil that I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I love it. I smelled some other Organic and Non Organic Lavender Oil&#x27;s at the store and I didn&#x27;t like the smell too much. I took a risk in purchasing this but I have no regrets. I used this to add scent to my Coconut Lotion and it smells lovely. I also just rub it on my hands sometimes just because I love the smoothing scent. I look forward to trying out other Essential Oils through this company.</li>
    <li> Love this oil! I use it in the bedroom to give the room a subtle scent and a relaxed sleeping environment.</li>
    <li> I love your lavender essential oil. I use it in many ways. I must have overlooked the card insert to learn about all your essential oils. Could you send  it to me as an email?</li>
    <li> My friend suggested I try using a therapeutic grade lavender oil topically for some discolored scars on my knees. Well, I won&#x27;t know for a while if it&#x27;s working (she said it could take about a year to see a real difference) but I will say the scent is lovely! Also, the company sent me a couple of ebooks on essential oils which was really nice of them. Overall, this was a great price, I like the product, and I appreciate the company&#x27;s level of customer service. :)</li>
    <li> This oil has a great smell. I put a dab on my sheets and love it.</li>
    <li> works great will buy again</li>
    <li> WE USE IT IN DOG&#x27;S BATH...HELPS ALOT WITH ODOR</li>
    <li> I like to buy organic therapeutic lavender oil because predominately I use it topically.  It is my &#x27;go to&#x27; first aid natural product for problems such as when I burn myself while cooking, it completely eases the burn, prevents blisters, heals fast and leaves no scar.&lt;br /&gt;Its also the best for me with insect bites, cold sores and blemishes on skin.  I will never take a vacation with out it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been told that 65% of what you put on your skin  enters your bloodstream, so it has to be organic for me.  Lovely product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The best lavender essential oil ever!  I&#x27;ve been mixing my own perfumes for years, and was amazed at how little I need to use.  The scent is pure and clean.  Buy this oil!</li>
    <li> I mix this with the peppermint oil and have it on a little figurine on desk at work. My patients probably don&#x27;t even realize it but they are getting the therapeutic effects of the calming Lavendar and healing Peppermint. My co-workers love the scent as well.</li>
    <li> I got this in hopes it would help my tension headaches. I have 3 herniated disk in my neck and I&#x27;m in constant pain. I also got this to try to help me sleep. Sadly it did not help my headaches but that&#x27;s because of my health issues. I did help my husband&#x27;s headaches and he likes it being put on his pillows. I also use it in my baths about 3 or 4 drops do it. Lovely smell and feels great on the skin. I am very pleased</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used lavender or any other oil.  I am quite surprised at how wonderful it smells and how it helps the pain in my arthritic shoulder.  What is left on my fingertips smells so nice, I go to sleep with my hand near my face.  I also ordered the peppermint oil from WellnesScent and though at first I didn&#x27;t think it smelled so great...when I put it on, it has even a better pain relieving effect than the lavender.  I am very pleased and would definitely order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I am a massage student and this oil was recommended to me by an instructor. I am very pleased with it and i will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
    <li> this lavender oil smells great and for a great price!!</li>
    <li> yumm this is strong and relaxing....</li>
    <li> Smells great! However, I wish the bottle had a dropper. Besides that smells great!! I had an issue with my shipment and customer service was on point!! I&#x27;ll be back to purchase more!</li>
    <li> The scent is perfect, it is not overpowering.  I absolutely love Lavender and this def works to sooth and relax me when I need it.</li>
    <li> The Lavender Oil arrived well protected in the package and quickly.  I have used a few drops in my mascara (to deter mites, yuck!)  and diluted in a spray bottle for my dogs in lieu of chemical flea deterrent. I love the scent and it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using lavender essential oil for many years.  This one has a distinct chemical odor and does not smell like an authentic lavender oil.  The product description stated that it is organic, but there is no organic label on the bottle; hence, the probable reason for the chemical odor.  This oil, in my opinion, has a putrid smell.  The only reason I ordered this one was because of the good reviews, which now perplexes me.  I would steer clear of this company&#x27;s essential oils and instead order from a known organic line.</li>
    <li> Price was fair and smell is accurate.  Waiting to see if holds the strength of the smell. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
    <li> this was ordered because it was recommended by a massage therapist.  It is supposed to sooth body and gives a good aroma which it does both.  So all is good</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful aroma. So relaxing and soothing</li>
    <li> Great lavendar oil! I will be ordering again. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this brand. I&#x27;ve used it in the bath, on sheets and in a diffuser.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and as expected - seems to be of good quality. Haven&#x27;t used it yet (reason for 4 stars instead of 5) though feeling good I have it available when needed.</li>
    <li> Received my lavender oil in a just a few days.  Love to use it in my bath with epsom salts.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It says multiple times in Amazon description this essential oil is &amp;#34;organically grown, organic grade&amp;#34; but when you receive the oil, no where on the label does it state organic. I get it, things can be organic but not certified. However, since I don&#x27;t know this company, how do I know it&#x27;s organic? I don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I purchased the lavendar oil and it smells nice.  The scent last longer than the “watered down” version others have. I woudl purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of WellsScent&#x27;s essential oils..lavender and tea tree oil. not knowing a thing about blending these oils I found that this company gives you a free ebook with your order as guide. Thank you ever so much to the company for your quick return to my request. I&#x27;m new to essential oils and your e books have been very helpful. I have purchased four of your essential oils now.I have used your lavender and tea tree oil in a base of body cream that has no scent or additives. The scent turned out soft and lovely. Nothing smelled chemically based and use it all the time ... could not be more satisfied. One thing, I added rosemary that was not on its own but in a carrier olive oil. I do not care for olive oil use as a carrier oil. I have substituted fractionated coconut oil. The products and company get a well deserved five star review on Amazon and thank you for your good products, books and wonderful customer service.</li>
    <li> This Lavendar EO is the most pure and potent I have smelled and used yet! It is absolutely amazing! For those giving 1 star and stating it has a chemical smell, you are obviously used to lower quality oils or purfume grade. This oil does smell different then many other brands I&#x27;ve used but it&#x27;s because it is so pure and concentrated. I Use most all oils neat and actually diluted this brand and used only 2 drops. I ordered this as a test for Wellnesscent and will be going to order more now!</li>
    <li> Smells really good. A  little goes a long way. I use it as a relaxation and sleep aid, just rub a couple of drops on the palm of your hands and then on the pillow case. I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> This is great added to bath.  Helps to relax you.  Doesn&#x27;t take much and leaves a great smell in the room</li>
    <li> Smells so good! It&#x27;s very strong so a little goes a long way. I bought a 20 lb bag of unscented epson salt on amazon which is awesome to have delivered with Prime shipping. I will be putting a few drops of lavender essential oil in it and save money on buying those smaller bags of lavender scented epson salt. Going to try it tonight! I take a warm bath every night since it makes me feel better as I&#x27;m 9 months pregnant and very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I am starting to feel like it&#x27;s not the most natural smelling lavander scent. I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> I bought the lavender and peppermint. They smell similar with is not right. I compared them to do terra and they are not even close!!! Can I return and get a refund?</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! We put it on the pillow and it lulls us to sleep!</li>
    <li> I used this lavender oil to make lotion and body scrub and it&#x27;s better than that I purchased at the health food store because it is has a fresh scent verses the one I got from the health food store.  I will be buying additional oils for soaps in the near future.</li>
    <li> I think this oil is pretty good.  Just not the most potent.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner, and I was very pleased with the oil good smell and winter well!!!</li>
    <li> Just received my oil today. It smells lovely! Since it is -20 in Montana... I will enjoy a few drops in my hot bath tonight.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ! Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love the lavender oil. I got it to calm my German Shepard. I rub it on my wrists and a little on her bedding seems to work beautifully! Thank you ⭐️</li>
    <li> Good product. Seems like you get exactly what you think youre getting. I would buy this again for refills when needed.</li>
    <li> This is a delightful, pungent, healing, and healthful oil that I use for a number of reasons and applications. Anyone that purchases it ought to do research to find out how it will uniquely benefit them. I use it for healthy hair, lymph circulation, and general well being. I highly recommend this brand for its pure smell and its ability to show immediate results.</li>
    <li> Im not found of how the oil poors out. It will give a drop and then a bunch with come out when Im just trying to get another drop. I also bought this product because it says its organic but no where on the label does it say its organic.....The scent does smell nice.</li>
    <li> Great quality product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This oil smells great. So far I have used it near my bed to help me sleep and mixed it with walnut oil as a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I put a couple of drops on a cotton square under my pillow at night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely way to go to sleep and naturally it is safer than a candle!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t exactly hate it, but not in love with it either. It is less camphor than Nature&#x27;s Own Premium Lavender Essential Oil, but still lacks the sweetness that I expect from English Lavender. I&#x27;ll live with this one but not likely to reorder. It is so hard to find a good quality lavender oil that won&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
    <li> The oil is lovely smelling but I was surprised at how quickly it evaporates.</li>
    <li> Just purchased this oil for my daughters because I was told lavender can be helpful for those suffering with eczema. One of the reasons I chose this particular brand was because of the free ebook on essential oils. Well,  I got the oil but no book or link to download it. NOT HAPPY!!!!!</li>
    <li> The description calls this &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; but there is no label anywhere on the actual bottle that verifies this.  Which means I ordered an essential oil with no quality control whatsoever. I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s safe to use at this point. :(</li>
    <li> LOVE this! The smell is fabulous. I have used Fabulous Frannie and this seems to be a tad bit stronger than FF. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Not as strong smell as I like but it will do. I may just buy from the local health food store. I may not buy again if I can find one with a stronger scent.</li>
    <li> Arrived well packaged and ahead of time.  Oil is lovely. Thanks for a great product and providing as promised.</li>
    <li> I received the Lavender Essential Oil on time packaging in tacked. I am so excited to receive this product, it&#x27;s great. And l definitely plain too purchase this again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I am new to aromatic oils and so far lavender is my favorite. I use it alone, mixed with jojoba as a carrier oil or mixed with other oils like peppermint or lemon. This oil seemed very high quality I just wished it also came in a larger size. My favorite use so far is sprinkled on a small cotton ball that I place in my pillow case. Sweet dreams.</li>
    <li> I thought this would smell more like my fresh lavender, but it is not unpleasant.  I might try a different brand next time.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like actual lavender. Tried it out because the price was good but smells watered down almost. I learned my lesson to pay more for better quality</li>
    <li> High quality, smells great! I am really happy with this product and will undoubtedly order more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Not really pleased with the scent.  I cannot claim any particular benefits from using it.  I use it at night before bed to relax, but I still need to take melatonin to fall asleep.</li>
    <li> Excellent experience with seller and great product</li>
    <li> Very soothing and calming for all animals (4 and 2 legged!).  I use a drop on my pillowcases every few days and a drop on the cats&#x27; and dog&#x27;s bedding as well.  A little goes a long way, this is very strong, good quality oil.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. The customer service is awesome. I bought this for my bath. 10 drops, handful of epson salt &amp; half cup baking soda, soak in tub for 20 minutes! This combination draws out toxins, lowers stress-related hormones &amp; balances your ph levels.</li>
    <li> I used this product to make bath salts and milk bath. I was very pleased with how well the fragrance held.</li>
    <li> This essential oil works great as a perfume on the skin, in an oil diffuser, as a mattress cleaner along with baking soda (PINTEREST) and even added to a spray bottle of water as a cleaning/refreshing agent. It smells amazing and seems to help me relax when the aroma is in the air. A single drop is potent and strong so too much product is not needed which is great for making this bottle last.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil for the price. Seems like Pure lavender oil to me. Strong in scent, in a good way. Will repurchase!</li>
    <li> This oil is very concentrated, unlike some that are diluted. I like to place a drop or two on my palm, lightly rub my hands together, then rub the oil onto my pillow, under the pillow case. The scent is crisp and clean and so relaxing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for an antibiotic on skin and it clears up the issues within days. I mix with organic coconut oil to apply. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> Using Lavender oil in my massage therapy practice.  Customers love it as it enhances their therapy experience.  It also helps to create a fragrant, relaxing environment for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality.  I am a repeat customer who is very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I received the oil relatively quickly. It is very fragrant and pleasant. It&#x27;s a great oil, and for a great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice for hot baths relaxation and meditation. Smells beautiful. Thank you so much +++++</li>
    <li> I put drops of this essential oil onto my night clothes so that I drift off to sleep easily.</li>
    <li> I WAS TOLD BY A HOLISTIC DOCTOR, TO TRY THIS ON MY CATS BEDDING, AND TO RUB A LITTLE IN MY HANDS AND THEN PET THE CAT !  WOW IT WORKED LIKE A CHARM ! DON&#x60;T USE MUCH ON YOUR HANDS, IT MIGHT BE HARMFUL TO THE CAT .  THE REASON FOR THE ANXIETY IS I INTRODUCED A NEW(OLDER)&lt;br /&gt;FEMALE CAT INTO MY HOME. AND MY 2 YEAR OLD  (HATES) HER AND THE OLDER CAT MUST HAVE BEEN ABUSED,AS SHE IS AFRAID OF EVERY ONE BUT ME .&lt;br /&gt;I FEEL THAT IS BECAUSE I FED HER AND BROUGHT HER IN FROM THE COLD LAST FEB. SHE IS NOW MUCH MORE CALM AND MY YOUNGER CAT NEEDS ANGER MANAGEMENT CLASSES.  P.S. IT&#x60;S HALF THE PRICE THAN, THE ONE THAT COMES FROM PROVANCE, FRANCE</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husbands boss who loves lavender. She diffuses it at her business and everyone compliments the lovely smell.</li>
    <li> I got this within a reasonable time. I love the scent of lavender. But contrary to the claim on the label, this brand seems to have a breakthrough scent of pine or other woodsy scents that overpowers the lavender scent. So I question the 100% natural pure claim. Will continue using for a few more days to see if I get used to it. Otherwise, I will be searching for a truer lavender scent as I know it.</li>
    <li> I truly enjoy the scent of this oil. I use it in conjunction with Grapeseed oil as lotion especially during winter when my skin dries here in the States given that I was used to the African Equitarial climate. I also pour a few drops on my Epsom/Magnesium salt baths since I plays lots of sports all week, hoping to relax my overworked muscles/body. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to any one. Thank you and God Bless.</li>
    <li> I was recently in rear ended in a car accident.  Thankfully, I had no broken bones, but my entire body was bruised and extremely sore.  One of my friends suggested rubbing lavender oil on my body, especially my limbs and head, and also using it in my bath.  It immediately helped me relax, which naturally assisted in reliving the pain without the heavy duty pain medications prescribed by the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with all of the positive reviews on the product, which I read before buying.  The scent is wonderfuly calming, and it feels really good on my skin.  When I used it in my bath, it was both relaxing and the smell is heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently checked into a hotel and smelled musty, and used the oil as therapy to get rid of the smell.  I LOVE this product and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciated the E-Book Oil Guide that I received after purchasing.  I will buy again and will explore other products by WellnesScent.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the aroma of this Lavender. I have used it in my diffuser and the whole house smells great.</li>
    <li> In order to find lavender oil of this quality, I have to drive way across town to a health food store. Why bother, when I can have it delivered to my door? Lavender oil has so many uses, and this one is of excellent quality.  I also received a nice follow up email from the seller, who cares about customer satisfaction...thus, the reason for me writing this review.</li>
    <li> Received this product quickly and have not a single complaint about it&#x27;s quality. It smells amazing and I am almost ready to purchase more. I use this with my yoga students and create lavender eye pillows for rest and relaxation and have had many tell me how wonderful the scent it. Couldn&#x27;t say anything more about how great this product has been.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the package in which the bottle arrived, I could smell the relaxing lavender smell. First time buyer of Lavender oil so can not compare it with any other brand. I love this one though.</li>
    <li> Went on a diet to lose weight and detox and lavender oil was used along with epson salts and baking soda, worked well for me, was very relaxing and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this and will definitely buy it again :)</li>
    <li> I use it everynight before bed, it relaxes me and I fall right to sleep.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife&#x27;s birthday (among other items) because she regularly uses aromatherapy from her naturopath, and also enjoys scented oils when she has a massage.  She did like the smell and it seemed to calm her headaches.  At the time I bought this product, I got 1 oz for around $10, which is a lot when you consider that it is meant to be used a drop at a time.  It&#x27;s a great bargain, especially compared to other pure lavender products.</li>
    <li> Love these oils and the ebook is going to be invaluable. Thanks</li>
    <li> Seems very good at first but then sort of starts to smell artificial.  Doesn&#x27;t last super long.  Not really great on the skin... better suited on a pillow or some other cloth to keep in a room so it smells nice.</li>
    <li> A few drops in the baby&#x27;s bath before bed time...worked great! Very happy with this product and will purchase again when I&#x27;m out. Fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> I used the oil to make lavender bath salts that I am giving as presents. The oil mixed well with the salt and did not clump. The scent is long lasting. I have not used it for anything else yet and have not given it out yet to get feedback.</li>
    <li> A great price for a great natural product-- I&#x27;ve been using it to make soap and it&#x27;s done the job perfectly! Exactly what I thought I was purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love my lavender oil! I have been putting a few drops in the tub while I take a bath with some epsome salts and putting a drop or two in hot water that I soak a wash clothe in and then lay over my eyes. The oil smells great and helps me relax. I am very pleased with the company as well. I immediately received an email with the e-book on lavender oil attached. I also received a follow up email making sure my oil had been delivered. I am Very Very pleased and will be ordering from them again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use in my scented baby wash and lotions to make more natural versions, instead of putting unknown chemicals on my 4 month old baby.  This worked wonderfully!  It smells great and is a great price.  The same type of essential oil cost $8 more at a natural chain grocer; I won&#x27;t mention their &amp;#34;Whole&amp;#34; name ;-).  This is definitely worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Not much to say about this other than I simply love it! I don&#x27;t understand why this particular item couldn&#x27;t be shipped along my entire order. And the packaging for this order was not that good all ... luckily the glass bottle didn&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> I love it! Perfect scent.  Purchased to help relax - put it on pulse points, spray on bedding, etc.  Exactly what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Worked like a charm for my 5 year old son who is allergic to mosquito bites. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this to see if it would soothe my neuropathy. I mixed the oil with some olive oil and used it to massage myself. It did feel soothing on my skin and smells great. It did give me some relief and I do just really like the feel and smell of it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price. Sometimes it is a little tricky to get out just a drop or two. But overall I am enjoying the product.</li>
    <li> Strong pure smell. Very soothing and works for my needs. Cute bottle! Holistic use that can be combined with any base carrier.</li>
    <li> Well I am just now getting a chance to try out my products and I do love them both...  I read in some areas where some say they are watered down and I did not get that impression as I gave it an odor test. A few drops mixed in some oil and it gives that relaxing sense of calm. I wish I had purchased more than one but this was just a tester and I am happy with the results. Im learning more about the use of oils and their many purposes. I would indeed recommend this item and can tellya...Im sold. Im now checking into other oils Im wanting and will be ordering very soon once Ive made up my mind as to which I need more. I will definitely be ordering more of the lavender regardless and it will be with my next order. I can only say, this is a very wonderful oil to use... I say try one before you order more as I did and if you like, you will know the next time to order more.. Thanks also to Amazon for the ontime service as promised.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent! I used it at work and i felt calmer and able to handle stress better. Thank u for wonderful oil.</li>
    <li> Smells great,not overpowering.  Use it on my microwaveable heating pad ,also use it in drawers for musty clothes smell,just roll up old socks and put them in drawer with a few drops on them and. use in closets also.  My husband has&lt;br /&gt;stinky running shoes in one closet and this is the freshest the closet has smelled.  Also use for my rheumatoid arthritis flare ups,just massage on joints.  Very pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed in the scent.  This is not a high altitude alpine French lavender (lavender grown at high elevations naturally produces more linalool and linalyl acetate- the compounds that give lavender that wonderful, soft floral aroma).  I smell more of a camphorous, green, almost anise like aroma in this lavender.  I&#x27;m sure it is still great to use medicinally and has strong antibacterial properties but this is not the best oil to diffuse.  I do have a very sensitive nose and smell is very subjective, others may be perfectly pleased with the aroma.</li>
    <li> So relaxing! Made my skin feel so silky smooth.....even my feet!  Wish I had bought it sooner. Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> It smells great and was delivered quickly.  Still going to take me some time before I can comment on the health benefits but I do seem more relaxed after sniffing it.</li>
    <li> Once a week I take a hot, 20 minute bath with about 10 drops of the Lavendar oil, a handful of lavendar epsom salts and a 1/2 cup of baking powder. The combination is supposed to draw out toxins, lowers stress-related hormones and balance your pH levels. Add some relaxation music in the mix and you&#x27;ve made your own spa night. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Good lavender fragrance.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Mix 1/2 cup baking soda, a handful of Epsom salts, and 10 drops of lavender oil and you have the most relaxing bath in history.  The sent from this oil is the purest I&#x27;ve come across.  An extra note, the manufacturer checked in to be sure Amazon had shipped on time.  Never a worry, but following up is an excellent policy.</li>
    <li> I have been using lavender oil for several years to relax and rest at night. I put it on my pulse points and on my neck just before bedtime.  However, this is the first time I have used this brand.  I love it and find, as others have, that it is superior to other brands. After reading the comments of other customers, I plan to make use of it in other ways. This will definitely be my go to brand when I need to replenish my supply.</li>
    <li> Love the oil!  I have been using it now for a week solid in my diffuser and neat.  I am using for myself, my husband for sleeping on his feet and for my dogs to help them relax.  I am using the petting method for my dogs.  It seems to be working well.  The only thing I don&#x27;t care for on this product is the plastic lid - the drops don&#x27;t come out as a drop - they come out more like a stream and if you only tilt bottle a little bit it gets caught in the lid and then you don&#x27;t get anything but a splash...so I just use an eye dropper now.  I really like the customer service I received from Wellness Scent - they have been very good to deal with.  I have not spoken to them about the plastic insert yet, but I will.</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil. I put a drop or two in my cleanser and lotion. I also make my own laundry and liquid hand soap (using ingredients bought from Amazon!!) I use lavender oil in these and also in a spray bottle with water. It makes a great cleaner for  just about anything and smells great!!!! Very good service from this supplier. Thanks Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> The oil is excellent--very fragrant.  I received the oil the next day--quick delivery! I will definitely purchase all my essential oils from Wellness Scent in the future!</li>
    <li> This stuff works great, a little goes a long ways. It does have a strong scent and has worked perfectly for my applications. I will be buying again for sure!</li>
    <li> It smells horrible other than that it seems to work pretty well I just can&#x27;t get past the smell it smells nothing like lavender</li>
    <li> Not bad. Enjoy this product</li>
    <li> Very nice product and it was shipped quickly.  I&#x27;ve been using it at bedtime on my pillow and have noticed that I&#x27;ve been sleeping much better.  I only wish that you sold them with a roller-ball applicator.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> Love this oil very refreshing.</li>
    <li> The lavender oil is amazing.  I used it in a body cream for my baby with shea butter and almond oil.  It is very relaxing and invigorating in the cream.  All of us use the cream at home.</li>
    <li> I use this oil on my face along with argan oil and sometimes coconut oil.  I have extremely sensitive skin (suffered from acne, used extremely strong prescription strength acne medication called Accutane, and still suffer from break-outs, super oily skin alongside super dry flaky irritated skin).  This Lavender oil hasn&#x27;t caused me any skin problems and when I use it alongside my Argan Oil (both of which I ordered together... the argan oil is from Mogador Certified Organic 100% Pure Argan Oil), it has made my skin really even.  My oily parts are no longer slick with oil...and my super irritated dry flaky skin is now looking moisturized and normal!  I am new to using essential oils for facial skin, but so far, these two items have done wonders.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> Quick service. Exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> I love this product, lavander oil helps me relax so much.</li>
    <li> I use a few drops of this oil in a mist spray on steamed towels for facials. Long lasting scent.</li>
    <li> Lavender seems to be the Swiss Army knife of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;from healing to relaxation and much to my surprise bug repellant.&lt;br /&gt;enjoyable smell unless you&#x27;re a bug. The question that I always ask if I want to know if it&#x27;s any good. Would I buy this again? In this case, yes I would.</li>
    <li> this is quality product - Lavender oil is so versatile. I use it to keep skin problems under control, a little in an emerging pimple always works - or added to water for a bug repellant always works! Your protected and smell great.</li>
    <li> I used this to make rice bags for gifts and it worked great with just a couple of drops. Smells good after being warmed in the microwave for a minute.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and was just as I had hoped. It has a nice lavender smell, perfect for adding to my bath bomb recipe.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with some unscented massage oil and it works great!  You just need a few drops and you get a relaxing scent that really helps the massage work its magic.  Not sure what else there is to say!</li>
    <li> I received  this today and LOVE it!  It is such a Beautiful Lavender smell.  I love the fact it is 100% Natural and Pure.  And I love the fact that it is Non-Toxic and a Pure Fragrance Delight, for my home!  Thank you for offering this!  I will order again and again.</li>
    <li> The Scent is not as good as I expected. I am not very satisfied with this lavender oil very much.</li>
    <li> This is a great Lavender oil.  It has so many uses, such as freshener for laundry(seriously, just sprinkle a few drops into the water e before adding your clothes to the washing machine for a lovely and calming effect on your bedding, etc.  It works great in a bath or added to a lotion or base oil either alone or mixed with other essential oil flavors.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. Expected more for the price. Not sure what the ad said, but definitely not worth what I paid for it.</li>
    <li> Why is this item listed as &amp;#34;Prime Elegible&amp;#34;?  Doesn&#x27;t prime membership and prime eligable items mean you can get 2 day delivery?  After ordering this item, I noticed the estimated delivery date is over a week from when I ordered it.  I went back to the ordering page and noticed that there was no 2-day delivery option, only standard delivery.  I don&#x27;t know if this is Amazons fault or WellnesScent&#x27;s fault, but either way I am not happy.  I chose this item because it had the &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; logo next to it with the expectations that I would be able to receive this in 2 days.</li>
    <li> I dropped my last bottle in the tub... catastrophe! I ordered this bottle online and it was delivered in just 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;The scent is perfect and I have already used it several times to help relax after a long day.  A few drops in the tub with Epsom salts and I&#x27;m in heaven!&lt;br /&gt;Love love love this product, and the personal email to check on my satisfaction was awesome too!</li>
    <li> I read all of the top reviews before buying and man, what a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Does not feel oily/slippery. It&#x27;s very watery.&lt;br /&gt;- Smells disturbingly strong, like cheap perfume. It burns of Lavendar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find this product to be smooth, relaxing or sensual in the least.</li>
    <li> Has a beautiful lavender fragrance. Before this one, I wasn&#x27;t very keen on lavender. Specifically the Now Foods lavender. I feel that this one is not diluted in any way.</li>
    <li> My acupuncturist uses this during our sessions and it is so relaxing, I had to order some for home.  I put it on as much as I remember but particularly when I feel a small headache coming on.  I suffer from pretty awful migraines and the only thing that works is Excedrin Migraine.  However this lavender oil seems to stop the headaches before they truly begin.  I used to take Excedrin 3-5x/week and I&#x27;ve only taken it once since I ordered this because it is soothing and relaxing, every time.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love :) Sleeping like a baby &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> The delivery was extremely fast, the oil is top grade, just wonderful!!  I am a Lavender &amp;#34;freak&amp;#34; and put lavender in all of my products that I make as well as sprinkle it on some dried lavender flowers for the smell in the house.  I will order this again!!  Thank You!</li>
    <li> I like this oil. It is great for diffusing, but I must say that the scent doesn&#x27;t seem exactly like true lavender. However, it could be that I don&#x27;t know what a true lavender oil smells like because this is my first one. Still, to me, this one has an after-smell, if there is such a thing, that smells a bit like a chemical. Also, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of research on lavender essential oil and discovered that if it is pure, it should be edible - this one says &amp;#34;for external use only&amp;#34; on the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably will not repurchase unless I find that other lavender oils smell similar to this one. I will be using the entire bottle, though, because it really does diffuse beautifully (I don&#x27;t notice the chemical smell when I do this), and it is a great price.</li>
    <li> I have been very impressed with this Lavender Oil.  Anyone who understands the difference between Therapeutic Grade and &amp;#34;100% essential oil&amp;#34; knows that they are not the same. This is Therapeutic Grade.  Additionally, I always research the company who makes the essential oils before purchasing, and again, very impressed.  They only make Lavender and it seems that they take great pride in their work.</li>
    <li> I use this to abate pain in my knees and hands due to rheumatoid arthritis. It doesn&#x27;t work 100% but it works well enough to let me get back to work! I cut it with almond oil and apply 2-3 times per day. I think it&#x27;s better than taking ibuprofin.</li>
    <li> Helps heal burns! Smells great and burns heal much faster with this oil... better than anything else that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I buy this Lavender. The smell is unique! I love using it with my diffuser and also with other essential oils for my face</li>
    <li> Disappointed, I found the Lavender Oil overpowering and musty.  Didn&#x27;t state &#x27;natural&#x27; on the bottle.  Heck, I put this stuff everywhere, pulse points in the evening, Neck at bedtime, in bath tub with Epsom salt, also as a sleeping aid and applied to bottom of feet with an Epsom salt lotion, rubbing it into the bottom of my feet before bedtime.  Also, on the temples as one reviewer stated.  None of these ventures did anything - I was still up all night as usual.  Whatever this stuff is it isn&#x27;t the true scent of &#x27;LAVENDER&#x27; that I remember as a child.  (Remembering the lilac trees in my back yard).  The review was correct that stated after the first two drops come out okay but  the drop can&#x27;t be controlled and the following drops come out too plentiful and can&#x27;t be controlled.  Didn&#x27;t like that - it is wasting the Lavender oil.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil.  Just a drop or two on my pillow helps amazingly to get to sleep.  And a few drops in a room is better than most room deodorizers.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product. Nice scent. You get a good amount for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be very careful about spilling it because it can get sticky. Trust me, I learned this the hard way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have pets, look out for what can be harmful to them. I had no problem with this product and I have cats, but I want all pet owners to be aware of risks of certain essential oils to their pets.</li>
    <li> I apply 1 drop to my I am tummy or hips and rub it in, every other day. This is for stress relieve &amp; to lower my BP/&lt;br /&gt; I am an avid user of essential oils and will NEVER buy perfume again...</li>
    <li> This stuff was great! I mixed a small drop of this with massage oil and it provided a nice relaxing aroma that served me very well when giving my SO a massage. If you do it right, this can last a long time. I&#x27;d recommend this. I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
    <li> Great product. Pure bliss will order more. I use it to give sent to my oil lamps, Thanks for this oil</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is essential in my homemade body butter recipe. I love this brand and will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> I wife is into oils, this lavender oil and she likes it, she says its just like the other oils brands she buys from other site.</li>
    <li> I am going to be using this for chigger/tick repellent.  I will update this review after my trip.  The smell is great!</li>
    <li> The is the first time I&#x27;ve used this brand and I am really enjoying it.  I mix it with non-scented lotion to help me relax at night.  I also mix it with castor oil to put on the bottoms of my feet when I am experiencing insomnia. Very nice!</li>
    <li> I have just begun using essential oils for aromatherapy, topical use, and more.  I am just starting to discover all the wonderful benefits lavender oil has to offer. This lavender oil is an excellent quality.  It has such a lovely scent that it is perfect for a home diffuser or oil diffuser necklace.  It is excellent for relaxation.  It only takes a few small drops for each use, so this bottle will last awhile.  This oil is a great value.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for an oil that promotes relaxation, rest, and reduces insomnia.  I recieved a coupon for this product, my review is my own honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to mix with tea tree oil and coconut oil for my son&#x27;s eczema.  It worked great!!&lt;br /&gt;The description said it was organic, but the label did not state that. I contacted the company, and they assured me it was organic.  Very good customer service too!</li>
    <li> Everything arrived satisfactorily~~~and fast!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was very effective for what I purchased it for and I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I like to put a touch of it on my forehead for calming.  Especially at holidays this is a very therapeutic.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It can be used for so many purposes.  I keep one in the kitchen for burns... AMAZING on burns.. I mean miracle worker on burns.  And one in the kids bathroom for calming at nighttime.  Great product.  Good quality.  Great service.</li>
    <li> Lavener oil was recommended to help me relax and go to sleep at night.  This is my first experience with it and I&#x27;m very pleased.  The quality of this 100% Lavender oil seems top notch.  I can use it straight to dab on my pillow case and sheet or mix a few drops of it with jojoba oil for my face.  I will now try some other theraputic oils from this company.  I also liked the care taken in packaging the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Jan in KS</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling lavender oil I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s sweet and light. I was hesitant to open it as it&#x27;s advertised as organic but it&#x27;s not labeled organic anywhere on the bottle. After contacting the seller and receiving wonderful service I decided to give it a try. He confirmed that it was organic and high quality and that he will be getting the organic certification soon. I&#x27;m SO glad I opened it and used it! It smells amazing and I will surely be buying it again!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most best lavender oil i have bought. I have bought many other brands, and this brand is absolutely great! This one is pure lavender all the way! If your looking for the best, this is it!!!</li>
    <li> THIS OIL IS SUPERB!!!!! I PUT SOME ON MY LAVENDAR BUDS BESIDE MY BED AND IT WAS RELAXING. I HAD NO PROBLEMS GOING TO SLEEP. THE PRICE WAS GOOD AND THE SHIPPING VERY FAST. THANK YOU FOR SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! I have had some trouble with insomnia and this lavender essential oil has helped me relax and sleep. I think the company is even more impressive than the essential oil! They contacted me when I ordered the oil before it shipped to provide a document regarding the oil. How cool! They also contacted me after I received it checking in to see how I like it. Amazing people, amazing business, amazing oil. :)</li>
    <li> Delivery came as promised.  The fragrance is wonderful.  I have not used it on myself  yet, but will.  My original reason for buying it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a couple of episodes, Cesar Millan used lavender oil on his hands to relax a high energy dog.  Since I have two high energy Welsh Terriers, I have started putting a drop on their collars to relax them when out for walks.  So far, it has worked.  I am going to start using it for myself at night to see if I get a relaxing sleep.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night before I go to sleep. A few drops on my forehead and the back of my neck takes me to a very relaxing and soothing place, eventually I fall asleep feeling satisfied and spiritually nourished.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell of this oil.  I&#x27;m looking forward to adding this to my bath. It arrived within a reasonable amount of time.</li>
    <li> smells so much like real lavender!  I really enjoy this particular brand of essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands but I particularly like this one.</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is wonderful.  I used it in a bath with Epsom salts and coconut oil, and had a good long soak.  I slept so well!  The scent was natural, and the quality is wonderful.  I had excellent customer service from WellnesScent, with a personal follow up from Lucan.  The price is also great.</li>
    <li> I bought an unscented neutragena oil and mixed in some of this oil until it was lightly scented.  At nighttime, I put some on pulse points to help me sleep.  It is wonderful and relaxing and does not irritate my sensitive  skin when used in this way.  It is also great to put a little with the water in a steam iron.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and was all that I hoped for. I love the scent of lavender, but I needed this for medicinal purposes. I have been plagued by itchy bumps in my skin that could be insect bites or an allergic reaction,I never see the insects but the bites always show up around my ankles. They itch like mad and the more I scratch, the more they seem to proliferate. My doctor gave me a prescription for cortisone cream that didn&#x27;t seem to do anything at all. So I decided to go to essential oil of lavender, both as a preventive and a treatment. I massaged it into my skin on my ankles, calves, and feet for a few days, and the problem disappeared. Now I plan to apply it before I go walking (we live near a beach in Florida, lots of grasses and maybe sand fleas?), and after the bath. It&#x27;s good for my skin, smells lovely, doesn&#x27;t stain the sheets, and either repels the insects or treats the rash, whatever it is. I recommend it highly and wonder why I didn&#x27;t try this sooner.</li>
    <li> I use it each evening before I go to bed to relax and sleep better - would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Went all over the house as soon as I got it and left a little in each closet either on a sachet or tissue paper.  Was so good smelling, considering using as a perfume!</li>
    <li> I suffer from extreme panic and anxiety attacks and had been introduced to lavender oil a while back. A small bottle had been given to me. The brand was Dotera or something like that and it helped a lot but I could not afford it. I ran out and saw this that also said it was organic and pure so I tried it and boy am I happy I did not pay so much for the other as this is just as good. Get yourself a handkerchief or scarf add a few drops and  WOW. I even used it to re-oil my little lavender scented micro wave-heat up stuffed buckwheat animal and he is back to smelling great and warm and relaxing. Sometimes you get a great deal for what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I make my own perfume and lotions. This is perfect.</li>
    <li> Used it to make rice pillow for family members for Christmas and everyone loved the smell of lavender and the eucalyptus.</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in my steam cleaner to fresh up my carpet an my mattress.  My house now smells like a garden of Lavender. In fact my whole apartment smells so wonderful</li>
    <li> We just started using this for the whole family at night.  Everyone loves the smell and I&#x27;ve noticed I sleep better.  I will buy this again when we run out.</li>
    <li> Fantastic customer service, very diligent on making sure I was happy with my order. The product itself is great, I use it in baths, as well as around the house and love it! will buy more!</li>
    <li> I love Lavender and purchase Lavender spray. I ordered Lavender Oil to find a way to keep my house sweet and smelling good with Lavender.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually using this to help calm my dogz (ok me too!).  They love the smell of it and it seems to be working.  Perfect size and got here when expected</li>
    <li> Lavender oil is used for many holistic and aromatherapy arrangements. Including calming and helping a person to sleep. This lavender is pure and a great asset to any inventory of essential oil.</li>
    <li> This oil has a very strong and wonderful scent. I used it to make body lotion by mixing it with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  I added it to coconut oil and use it around my eyes and on my feet. I also added it to unscented lotion for body lotion. I put a couple of drops on my pillow. I love it!</li>
    <li> I like to add this oil to my bath with Epsom soaps for a wonderful relaxing soak. The lavender oil smells delightful!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered, smell is so soothing, I will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I put it in a spray bottle as suggested and spritzed my pillow at night. But the scent only lasted a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I received my lavender oil in great time and I had bought it along with some coconut oil so I could make sugar scrub for my son&#x27;s daycare teachers. I wanted to make sure I was going to like it first so I made a batch for myself. It smells great! It was such a nice and relaxing shower. :) I made up several batches of the sugar scrub using the oil and gave them out as Christmas gifts. My co-worker said it smelled amazing and I thought so too so I would definitely buy this oil again!</li>
    <li> This lavender oil has a nice scent. I am familiar with lavender oils, and not all smells are equal. I am satisfied with this product thus far.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.  She uses a tiny amount on her pillow case before she goes to bed.  She commented that anyone who doesn&#x27;t like the scent of this oil has never used real lavender oil and is used to a product that just has some lavender scent in it.  It is extremely strong and must be used very sparingly.  A bottle this size will last a very long time.</li>
    <li> I had been using a different Lavender EO for a year, and switched to this...because it was a little cheaper! THIS product did NOT perform very well, nor did I like the smell of it - did not smell &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; enough, is the best way I can describe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my uses for it is to apply it to my face and chest to mitigate any pre-cancer spots that arise, as I am in the sun a lot. The other brand did a GREAT job...but THIS brand COMPLETELY FAILED! I had to get 3 small pre-cancer spots frozen off shortly after I finished the bottle. Now I&#x27;m back to using Miaroma and my skin even feels better with it, and it certainly smells purer! My smell is very sensitive - maybe people liking this brand can&#x27;t smell the difference between this and a more pure brand! But I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again!</li>
    <li> I had been very skeptical of aromatherapy until I had my last mammogram and the hospital offered lavender essential oil to relax me and relieve discomfort. I have to admit I never liked the scent of lavender,  I decided that if it would really help me fall asleep better, I could put up with it. I really have been sleeping better since I started putting a drop on a cloth under my pillowcase each night. I&#x27;m now a believer!</li>
    <li> My sense of smell is really weak, but I bought this oil for its&#x27; therapeutic properties. Whatever I smell I do enjoy, and it definitely makes me deeply relaxed. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Another satisfactory purchase. It is as expected, and helped me relax after a stressful week. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying the lavender oil very much. Very nice.</li>
    <li> I use YL oils and ran out and couldn&#x27;t afford their prices.  This oil is very good.</li>
    <li> First, let me say that most essential oils on Amazon kinda make me nervous.  They&#x27;re sold in huge bottles for prices so cheap that a reputable EO company couldn&#x27;t possibly stay in business if they&#x27;re harvesting quality oils and not adulterating them with carrier oils or synthetics.  If you look up the Blue Tansy FB group, it has a lot of helpful information and independent third-party test results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the purity of WellnesScent&#x27;s products, as I am not a chemist.  However, a couple things give me more confidence in this product than most of the others from Amazon that I&#x27;ve received to evaluate &amp; review.&lt;br /&gt;  1. The product page actually states the country AND region where their plants are farmed/cultivated - they&#x27;re not buying from some shady source in China or India that can&#x27;t even tell them where the oil comes from.  The bottle also tells you not only the method of extraction, but what part(s) of the plant was used!&lt;br /&gt;  2. The price per ounce is actually a reasonable one that could allow them to make a living off it.  For example, Plant Therapy is another Amazon brand that HAS been shown through third-party testing to have quality pure oils.  The WellnesScent product is comparable to that.  And oils that cost more to produce (e.g. Frankincense) are priced higher accordingly, unlike some other brands on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely convinced, however.  This Lavender smells very close to pure lavender, sweet and flowery.  However it&#x27;s a little off, and has a faint chemical/artificial scent to it, as if it&#x27;s had a synthetic fragrance added, or been mixed with other oils.  The pungency of its scent suggests that it may not be made from true lavender, as other lavender varieties have higher levels of camphor that could cause this (e.g. spike lavender).  This raises the concern of what else might have been added too!  (The other oil I&#x27;ve received from WellnesScent, Frankincense, likewise has a faint chemical/artificial scent to it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while I can&#x27;t vouch for their purity, I do feel more confident using these oils than most others.  These are probably fine for aromatherapy, but I would be careful with topical use, and NO internal use!!  I am giving them three stars for being better than most but not beyond all doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: they come in the typical amber bottle with euro dropper, which properly dispenses only a drop at a time (instead of pouring out like some lids I&#x27;ve tried).  They were securely packaged in bubble wrap and come with a free eBook, which is always nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on this product in exchange for testing, inspecting and reviewing it.  I received no other compensation for my review and always give my honest and unbiased opinion of each product.  I welcome your questions &amp; comments on my experience.r purity, I do feel more confident using these oils than most others.

    <li> This smells really good! I added this to a coconut oil salt scrub that I made and it&#x27;s amazing. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong where it gives me a headache. Very relaxing!</li>
    <li> I love  this Lavender product. I mix this lavender in my lotion  and Shea butter mix.  It is very strong so a little goes a long way.  Also I would like to note that it shipped very quickly . I ordered the one day and it came next day with my prime shipping !&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to cut down on chemical based products natural ingredients such as this one is the key. Lavender has a calming effect on your senses and I have started to use it more lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use it also to fresh up a load of laundry by adding a couple of drops to my load ( again a little goes a long way)</li>
    <li> Main reason for purchase was for helping to get rid of silverfish.  On-line says that they hate the smell.  Have just started using it.  Also am gong to try it for my relaxation as I have health problems due to lyme disease.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to scent my blankets and bed sheets, in the hopes of sleeping more restfully at night.  I think I will combine this therapy with valarian root and it will be a hit...in any case, a little in a spray bottle with filtered water goes a long way; much longer than I expected.  I am new at purchasing and using essential oils, but if potency is an indication of quality, then this stuff must be good quality.  I am looking forward to using it for skin issues this summer, as other reviewers have suggested.  My husband is a chigger magnet every summer, and I will write back later to report if this stuff gives him any relief...</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful.  Very relaxing and soothing.  Definitely will be buying it again!</li>
    <li> This oil does help me to relax and the bottle last me almost and a week with everyday use.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Works great!  Smells heavenly!  I don&#x27;t use it on my skin like I have heard some ppl do, Instead I use it mixed in water.  It smells so good, very relaxing.  So far I am happy!  :)</li>
    <li> The smell of the lavender is great, it is skin safe, and well packaged. I used it to make salt scrubs for family, I also rub it on my hands each morning when I wake up my puppy, its a calm and soothing scent that she will associate with later when she&#x27;s a therapy dog.</li>
    <li> I could not figure out why I ran out of this oil so quickly. Finally read  the label of the bottle which is the same size as my 15ml. bottles. This one contains only 10ml.!!! Will stay away from this brand!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It has a light lavender scent that is very soothing.  I add a few drops to my kids bath to help settle them down at night.  I also mix with jojoba and coconut oils and use as a moisturizer for myself and my kids.  I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Very strong scent exactly what I was looking for. I use this in my baths and find that 2-3 drops is more than enough help to relax me.</li>
    <li> This oil is great. Nice and powerful scent, good value and built in dropper. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is what I&#x27;m just about to describe about a broken cap seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say that my bottle arrived with the plastic cap seal broken, so I was quite disappointed with my purchase. Once the seller was aware of it, they handled the issue very professionally and solved the issue. Honestly, I ended up very satisfied with them as a brand, because the way they handled my claim (lots of follow up) tells me how much they care about their business, which translates into a reliable product. At least that&#x27;s what it tells me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a change to read the free e-book, but it seems alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, I would definitely do business again with Wellness Scent.</li>
    <li> This oil is very good quality for the price. I was a doTerra user but now that I have found a comparable product, I will be using this one.</li>
    <li> my girlfriend has an allergy, but after massage with this oil she feels much much better. also I&#x27;m living in very dry area(mid cal) this oil helps my hand and body fresh. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought this to compliment my bath suite. Love the scent; very true. Will purchase this again when I run out! Recommend.</li>
    <li> I was a bit disappointed with the smell.  This oil may well be great at a lot of the things it&#x27;s recommended for, but my own reason for wanting lavender oil is for its aromatic property. The reviews were so great that I assumed it would be safe to order online (the benefit of buying in store is that there&#x27;s usually a counter sample to smell first).  I grow lavender, add dried lavender to a lot of things, I&#x27;m very familiar with the smell of actual lavender and use lavender oil somewhat regularly- the smell of this one seems just a little bit off to me.</li>
    <li> I have had candles, lotions,etc with Lavender before, but the essential Undiluted smells so good. At first it&#x27;s strong, but it doesn&#x27;t take long for it to lighten up. I&#x27;ve even used it just to smell from the bottle when my sinuses are acting up. It seems to help. I plan on using it for DIY lotions and other projects. I&#x27;m glad I got it and would recommend it to anyone looking for good quality.</li>
    <li> I use lavender to heal my injection sites as I am an insulin dependant diabetic.  I also use it on burns and other things to heal.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a suggestion from a book that Lavender Oil will help babies relax and sleep better. After I started using this in her nighttime routine, along with a few other things, she started sleeping THROUGH the night! This is a great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I&#x27;m using it two ways at this time. I put a few drops in my ultrasonic humidifier so it puts the fragrance directly into the air. The benefits are well worth it for keeping my asthma under control during the dry winter months in New England. I am also placing a few drops into a carrier lotion of sesame and almond oil, shea and cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for more natural alternatives for cleaning my home. After reading tips on Pintrest and from friends, I chose to purchase Lavender oil from WellnesScent based on their reviews. The eBook that was sent to me is GREAT! It gives you lots of information and other uses. The first time I used this I mixed several drops into baking soda and sprinkled it into our carpets. My house smells amazing! And this is only the first of many uses I have planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order came quickly, the product is exactly as advertised and I will order from WellnesScent again.</li>
    <li> Works great...I out a smidge on either side of my nostril and a little in my warm mist humidifier and it puts me in a very relaxed mood. Hoping to add some peppermint oil to my collection next.</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is beautifully scented, very pure,  and wonderful to use in bath or on pulse points.  It is very relaxing and I have found it to be my favorite of all lavender oils..An added bonus from the seller  was that they provided a lot of information on the oil. I will definitely purchase this oil and others again!</li>
    <li> Item as expected. I really like the smell. It makes my bath even more enjoyable. Doesn&#x27;t leak at all. Yup</li>
    <li> Good value and have used in bath as well as hair treatment.  Nice aroma and lasting scent.  First time using this brand and will try more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work to induce sleepiness as a therapeutic grade lavender oil should</li>
    <li> I have no complaint with the service - it was great.  It&#x27;s just that when I compared this lavender with the previous one I had (Aura Cacia) it wasn&#x27;t as soothing.  I can&#x27;t quite pinpoint the problem - I guess there is a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; note that comes through that I don&#x27;t get with the other brand - even though I trust that the extraction method is natural.  Anyway, it&#x27;s pleasant enough that I&#x27;m using it and I feel I got a good price, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Quality lavender essential oil and that&#x27;s for sure. Helped me relax and sleep when diffused in the air. I also applied this essential oil NEAT to the body.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, and so far, it works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of lavender for a little while now and it does seem to be good quality. It&#x27;s potent enough that if I put some on a cotton ball on my nightstand, I can smell it right when I walk in my room. I love that it comes out just a drop at a time. I prefer that over some of the other brands that I&#x27;ve gotten that were too big a bottle of oil and I had to use my own dropper with it so too much wouldn&#x27;t spill out. I would rather have a smaller bottle so that I can use it up before losing too much potency. Also, the e-books that you can get with buying the oils are a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> I have never tried oils before, but I&#x27;m so glad I did! This lavender oil has helped with so many things. It has actually repelled bugs that have been trying to creep into my house. this works wonders on those pesky silverfish that tried to get in your bathroom and under your sinks. it also provides a relaxing lavender scented atmosphere it will help you rest.</li>
    <li> The sent is exactly what I expected. I use it to keep my house smelling fresh. I put a few drop in my electric burner filled with water or a candle that I place on a electric burner and it lights up the house with Lavender. It is very relaxing. I would certainly buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered this to use as a scent for the apple cider vinegar I&#x27;ve been using to condition my hair.  It is incredibly potent and smells incredibly pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting in to holistic treatments lately and googled what types of essential oils reduce the redness/inflammation caused by acne.  To my surprise, lavender oil was listed.  I immediately started using it and have seen INCREDIBLE results within 5-10 minutes of applying to the red spots on my face.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  I rub a little on the bottom of my feet at night before going to bed and I rest so peacefully.  Or I rub a little between the palms of my hands and inhale it...same effect, restful and peaceful sleep.  And if I want to take an afternoon siesta, I just follow the same steps, either rub some on my feet or my hands and I get a great little snooze without any groggy after effects.  This essential lavender oil is wonderful!  I would encourage any that have difficulty sleeping, or who just want to ensure a good nights sleep, to try it.  You have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand of lavender oil for almost 4 years now, but the last couple of bottles I received had something funky about them so I returned them and bought this brand to try. I wish I had been using this all along! It&#x27;s wonderful. Definitely more fragrant.</li>
    <li> My 82 year old mom thinks she can&#x27;t sleep without it. She always asks that I &amp;#34;tuck&amp;#34; her in with it. I just purchased a bottle for her baby sister.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this oil! It&#x27;s smells fantastic. I have added it to my almond oil for a great scented moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Will buy again, Awesome.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help me sleep better and to feel less stressed out. I dilute it according to the directions and use it before bedtime. I also add a few drops to my bath water as well and it gives it that spa scent/feeling. I believe a lot in the healing quality of natural oils and use this for my tired achey muscles as well as a lot of other everyday ailments. The quality is spot on and doesn&#x27;t cause any weird reactions as it&#x27;s pure and natural. Works wonders!</li>
    <li> Love this in my oil diffuser. Use at night to help with sleep. Awesome smell to it</li>
    <li> Very good product. I&#x27;m finding different ways to use lavender oil every day!</li>
    <li> high quality lavender oil</li>
    <li> Love it. I used it primarily to mix with Coconut oil, and olive oil to create a rub for excema. Works great. Now I&#x27;m putting it on cotton balls and placing in my bed pillows.</li>
    <li> It is really a perfect product, and I am grateful to all the other purchasers for their reviews.  So many great ideas on how to use the lavender.  I bought it to use on my puppy&#x27;s tummy, he had a bacterial infection and I wanted to supplement his treatment.  I didn&#x27;t do it because I could not figure out the best way to  dilute it.  I also used it on my ankles to avoid mosquito bites.</li>
    <li> Very nice, all natural Lavendar, many uses, one is to make the Curly Girl spray to bring curls back on second day hair..  You can put it on your pillow for enhanced sleep, use it as a cologne.  I am sure there are other uses, those are just mine.</li>
    <li> The best purchase I made for me. I use it every single night and obtained immediate relief. I LOVE IT and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Mmmm, heavenly lavender scent.  I used it to scent soap and I&#x27;m quite pleased.  Only took a couple of drops.</li>
    <li> Smells good. I guess.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Shipping was good and the scent is pure. This is definitely a quality oil.</li>
    <li> Smells great....just like doterras and I use it on my dryer balls....no oil stains on cloths.  Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this lavender oil. Smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve also put a drop on acne blemishes and it really seems to help the blemish heal more quickly.</li>
    <li> I purchase the Lavender Oil for making Calendula Salve which I use for diaper rash, insect bites, wrinkles, burns, chapped lips and itching from dry skin.  It is a terrific source of Lavender oil.  I am gluten and soy allergic.  I&#x27;m always searching for natural products.  A book for the many uses of Lavender oil would be great.....</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works just as good.</li>
    <li> very strong lavender smell, drip bottle is awesome because it doesn&#x27;t comet too much at a time. I started using it on my eye mask at night and didn&#x27;t need to reapply for a week</li>
    <li> I have other bottles of lavender oil from different companies and all I can say about this bottle is WOW! Other brands smell like lavender, but this one smells like LAVENDER, meaning that it&#x27;s really intense. I love it! When I first opened the bottle, I accidentally spilled some on the bottle cap and my hand. Now, every time I open the bottle I have the scent on my fingers, which is a good thing. I add it to my body oil and the scent lasts a long time. When this bottle runs out, I&#x27;ll be back for more. Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> I am using this oil on my dog as a preventative for fleas.  Fleas do not like the smell of lavender.  The dog smells great!</li>
    <li> This is by far the most superior lavender oil i have bought. I have bought many other brands, and this brand is absolutely the best! Some lavender oils have a almost pine type of smell, but this one is pure lavender all the way! If your looking for the best, this is it!!!</li>
    <li> I received this very quickly and in perfect condition.  I also found it to be quite reasonably priced when compared to the prices of other vendors.  The scent is lovely and fresh.  I plan to use it in homemade body powder and I think it will be perfect.  Since talc is not safe, I will use arrowroot, cornstarch and a tiny bit of baking soda, along with the oil, to make the healthier version of dusting powder, and I know it will be a keeper!  In the meantime, I am sleeping with a drop of it on a cotton ball nearby and it is very naturally relaxing.</li>
    <li> Smells like rubbing alcohol or a toxic chemical. Had to throw it away and air out my house.  Buy some fresh flowers instead!  If there is a warranty as they claim, I would like a credit.</li>
    <li> The WellnesScent Lavender Oil is just as good as DoTerra brand.  Lavender oil is great for reducing stress and really does help a person get a good night&#x27;s sleep.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The product is as described. I&#x27;m a novice with the Essential oils, but enjoy this for skin care, air freshener, etc. No complaints</li>
    <li> Pure essential lavender oil is healing, in a number of ways. I like to add to a bubble bath, or my oil burners.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly.  Delicate and natural scent.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> Between the 2 of us, my husband and I are allergic to nearly every scented product that could be used in a home - laundry detergents, soaps, shampoos and cleaning products all must be free of perfumes to be safe for us to use. However, when we had to move to a home with moisture/mold problems, I wanted something to freshen the air just a bit, even though our HEPA filter runs 24x7. Your lavender essential oil, diluted in water, makes a wonderful air freshener that doesn&#x27;t cause us sinus problems. Thanks for offering this delightful product!</li>
    <li> Very welcome Scent.  Nicely packed. Thank you</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lavender. It smells the best. The price is great! It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I find the oil somewhat disappointing. I have trouble sleeping and thought this would help. Used it the last few nights and didn&#x27;t notice a difference.  It smells nice, but didn&#x27;t make me sleepy.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the delivery it all went ok until, I opened the bottle. The smell is way too strong. I used one drop and I couldn&#x27;t stand the overpowering smell. I felt I couldn&#x27;t breath. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again. I never had any kind of allergies to any kinds of oils, or strong smells ( I wear perfume all the time) but I would not recomend this if you have any kind of respiratory issues. Other than that I just think this product was not right for me.</li>
    <li> AWESOME! It works fantastic.  I have used as a water and lavender air freshener;.  We have also had trouble with fleas eith my animals.  A couple of drops and they feel much better.  The fleas do not like it in the least.  It is a great repellant too!.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big lavender fan and this oil lived up to its name! For the price you cannot get anything better. I doubt you could get better for a higher price, for that matter.</li>
    <li> Lavender oil was delivered on time and it&#x27;s better than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing and I definitely plan on ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> My wife buys doTerra oils. I was checking into some cheaper alternatives and bought this.  My daughter and I both agree that there is a &#x27;weird&#x27; scent to this oil.  Unsure what it is but it is not flattering.</li>
    <li> The oil is extremely intense and emits a wonderful scent.  I put a small amount in a diffuser and enjoyed the scent permeating the room.</li>
    <li> The smell of the essential oil is not the smell I had anticipated.  I have never used any essential oil for any reason but saw on a TV show that putting Epsom salt and lavender essential oil in your bath could help you relax.  So I wanted to try it.  It did not smell bad but did not smell like I had thought it would.  I will not order again.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, it&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> The scent is great and strong enough to be an effective sleep aid. I also add it to my bath water along with Epson salts. I will be ordering more at a later time. Also, the price was reasonable and the product arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Its is a great product everyone involved did a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> The seller did an EXCELLENT job shipping the product and seemed to make every effort to get it to me BEFORE the promised date and succeeded. The product arrived before the expected arrival date. Kudos to WellnesScent for its shipping/delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Lavender Oil 100% Natural Pure Undiluted does NOT smell like lavender. It has a medicinal or a non-flowery smell. It smells like someone mushed rotten flower petals and mixed it with an astringent type of oil base…??? Who knows how this product was created, all I know is that I have used it several times and not once have I smelled &amp;#34;lavender&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This lavender oil smells great and lasts a long, long time. It is easy to squeeze just a few drops out at a time, and, once diluted, the oil&#x27;s scent isn&#x27;t over-powering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will also mention that the customer service from Wellness Scent was superb. I received a couple different emails from them--first to confirm my order, then to follow-up and make sure I received the product on time. I really appreciated their thoroughness and thoughtfulness.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  Lavender is one of my favorite fragrances.  This seems to be superior oil.  I use it o my pulse points to relax at night and I also have a recipe for mosquito repellent that I am going to try it in.  Love the product and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Strong, natural lavendar scented oil. It has helped me to relax and fall asleep like a baby. This has been especially helpful at night during the third trimester of my pregnancy. I use a very minimal amount behind my ears and on my inner wrists. I plan on diluting the oil for future use.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil AND this seller!  The product is top of the line and the price was a great deal, something I really appreciate.  You will not go wrong if you order your lavender oil from WellnessScent!:-)  I have seen posts on social media conerning buying brand name oil from only brand reps.  The info stated that the oils sold by Amazon sellers could not be pure essential oil and I beiieve that is an untrue statement.  The lavender oil I have purchased from Wellness Scent smalls as strong as some other big brand name oils.  My purchases from this seller lead me to believe they are reputable and want to give customers reliable wellness products.  Thank you, Wellness Scent!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lavender but this organic grade is not what I anticipated. It has a very unique scent that I&#x27;m not very fond of. I will still use it as planned.</li>
    <li> Perfect scent and great price......highly recommend .  You do not have to spend a fortune for a quality Lavender Oil!</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great!</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the oil which was bought to blend with others as an acne cleanse...most impressed with the seller who reached out to me to verify its arrival and my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> The lavender oil is amazing, smells wonderful, great on my skin, excellent for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more, very soon.</li>
    <li> The WellnesScent Lavander Oil is exactly what I was in the market for.  The followup from  the seller is also fabulous, they have been very attentive to make sure I&#x27;m getting the full benefits of my purchase.  I highly recommend this product if you are searching for a true to scent lavander oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using Young Living Essential Oils for the past couple years but when I saw this oil and it was less expensive,I decided to give it a try. I use lavender oil in the diffuser at night, I put it in my massage oil, and use it for soap. This is the first time I have used this brand and it is wonderful! The scent is strong and pleasant. I LOVE it and will be using this brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I really like the  wellness Scent Lavender oil  I got on Amazon! Used it in a home Spa with Epsom salt and baking soda...a home detox spa!  I also used it on my lips before applying my chap stick...Really makes the chap lips go away!</li>
    <li> I like this just as much as doTERRA. Totally happy.</li>
    <li> Like that it&#x27;s 100% pure not mixed with anything else.</li>
    <li> It is just perfect. I mix it with massage oil and it works great. I also put couple of drops on my pillow before sleep.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really care for the smell, but maybe I&#x27;m just not a fan of lavender? Which I didn&#x27;t know until I purchased. I used it in baths throughout the end of my pregnancy, and it was greatly relaxing despite my slight dislike of the scent :)</li>
    <li> I use this in my holistic healing practice with clients, and it is such a wonderful healing tool.  This particular brand of lavender oil is just right on with the natural scent of lavender; not too strong, not too weak, but just perfectly balanced.</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in the bath and it smells amazing! A very little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great.  Good service!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok. It smells like something is added to the lavender and I do not like it. I have found another lavender oil which I like better. I am very sensitive to smells and get headaches if I am not careful.</li>
    <li> This a very small bottle</li>
    <li> I bought the Lavender 100% Pure Essential Oil (10 ml Oil) WellnesScent brand with some hesitance. I was not sure that it would be as high of a quality and may not meet the medicinal uses of my household, but based on other reviews I figured that it would be at least good for aromatherapy purposes (sleep and relaxation in particular). Initially I thought that I may not have made a wise purchase, because it gave me a headache, but then I cut the lavender content in half in most of my homeopathic recipes and tried again. After diffusing with one drop instead of my usual 2 or 3, it was clear that it was the 100% it claimed to be, just on the strong side. I have since used it in topicals to treat a burn, as an astringent to treat a acne flare, and as a rub for a headache. Since I don&#x27;t need as much and it is already less expensive than my usual brand, the savings is significant. I am considering trying other oils, but will definitely buy this one again.</li>
    <li> This is some REALLY good smelling stuff..thanks!</li>
    <li> This stuff smells AMAZING - like real lavender, not the perfumey type stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also mixes well with other oils - or as far as I can tell. As soon as I received this oil, I mixed a bit with eucalyptus (top note) and cedarwood (base) to be placed in my bodywash. Even though it&#x27;s sitting there &amp;#34;melding&amp;#34; together, it&#x27;s already fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely five stars. Can&#x27;t beat the price for this quality oil.</li>
    <li> Extremely disappointed. This smells nothing like lavender I waster  my $10.99  for nothing. Don&#x27;t even bother wasting your time with this. I also can&#x27;t even download the ebook</li>
    <li> I love this oil for head ache relief. Rub a little on your temples and it makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> I really wish that it came with a roller ball attachment.  Otherwise works great.</li>
    <li> Get it. Use it. Love it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was dietary, but it&#x27;s not!</li>
    <li> I just received my oil 2 days ago so I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but if you go by the smell it will be great.  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the true lavender scent of this item.</li>
    <li> Only used a few times so far.  The scent is delicate and calming. Possible use for migraines or for headaches.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK product but my body does not respond to lavender the way it does to other oils.</li>
    <li> Had a bad sunburn and the oil soothed it and rolled away the dead skin.  Also used to clean some cuts that were having a hard time healing.</li>
    <li> I have gone through 3 bottles of this stuff! Hands down best smelling lavender I have tried, and the price is great too! The customer service is fantastic too! I will continue to be a repeat customer</li>
    <li> I use it for my home made deodorant.  It works great and is subtle when mixed this way. I don&#x27;t use it for any other purpose. I thought it was a reasonable price also.</li>
    <li> After using 30+ different kinds of lavender oil, this is by far my favorite scented one.</li>
    <li> The item arrived as I expected when it was expected. It was packaged very well and is working out VERY well for me. I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Lavender is part of my nightly routine. I put it on just before bed for a good night&#x27;s sleep. This lavender works great and the scent is not over powering.</li>
    <li> Such a great product. I bought this to help my two year old daughter sleep and it has been working so far. I put a couple of drops on a Q-Tip and the dab it behind her ears. Works wonders. The company is amazing, answers questions and sends you a booklet on how to use the product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used essential oils before, but have recently started for different reasons. I use my lavendar oil in a face wash I made with coconut oil. I love it!!! It smells wonderful!  Not to mention the incredible customer service! this company is A+. As mentioned by another reviewer I don&#x27;t like the lid either but that&#x27;s my only issue.</li>
    <li> Love it! Very clean &amp; distinct lavender smell. Best EO I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon to date. 4-5 drops on diffuser pad is all that is needed to have your room filled with lavender &amp; relaxation. Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Smells great and I use it with almond oil to make a great skin moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve received the oil and it is what I expected it to be.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Loved using this for homemade products.</li>
    <li> Smells great. It&#x27;s 100% with no additives. Dropper lid (as with many essential oils) ensures you don&#x27;t use too much. I use it to add fragrance to my homemade body oil mixes. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Very please with this oil.  It smells wonderful and I use it at night on my temples and it helps me to go to sleep.  I have put a few drops in my antibacterial hand soap and it makes my hands soft.  I will order this again.</li>
    <li> I have used this when I have felt anxious about a doctors appointment. Somehow it works!&lt;br /&gt;Smells lovely anyway, even if you don&#x27;t feel upset.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfect for keeping closets smelling fresh.  Also can be used for calming.  Just put a drop on your hand, disperse, cup your hands on your face and breath.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Lavender Oil because I had read that it helps relaxing for sleep and as I travel almost continually, jet-lag has been a constant problem for me. The order was received very quickly and the oil was packaged in a small glass bottle with a drop dispenser under the cap. It does have a very nice smell and only a very tiny amount is needed to maintain the nice scent so it clearly is high quality oil. I do feel that its use was beneficial in relaxing and getting to sleep after long flights and many time zone changes, at the very least its nice odor provides a touch of home for the traveller. The delivery was very quick and the company followed up quite professionally to check and make sure I received it and was satisfied with the produce. I am satisfied and recommend the company for its aromatherapy products.</li>
    <li> I love this lavender oil. After I wash my face, I use this oil and it has prevented breakouts and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.  I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Great quality and scent</li>
    <li> Great oil but dropper is impossible to use without getting way too much at a time. Simple switch of droppers would make me buy again, but for now I am switching brands.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Just started using oils to help with muscle soreness and to relax.</li>
    <li> Beautiful beautiful love the fresh smell of lavender I put some on make up cotton ball and put in back of any drawer last long time the smell love</li>
    <li> Smells great, better than the other lavender species.  I can tell the difference when I have both next to me.  This other bottle now smells funny since I&#x27;m used to the English Lavendar.  This is a good product.  If really helps me calm down and sleep.  I rub it on my neck and wrists.  Dab a drop on your pillow too.  I could buy some other brand locally, but this brand smells so much better!</li>
    <li> Love this in my Epsom salts bath! Rejuvenating, calming, refreshing.</li>
    <li> I will not purchase again because the bottle was broken when it arrived. The two stars are because I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of essential oils so I&#x27;m not sure if this one compares with the brand I already take. Anyway it smells nice. Great price!</li>
    <li> I diffuse this at night, and I love it. It&#x27;s a wonderful scent and does not disappoint!</li>
    <li> Love it! I bought it to make my own mosquito spray. It has worked great!</li>
    <li> AT FIRST I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LITTLE TO LIGHT OF A SMELL BUT REALIZE THIS IS SUBTLE BUT REALLY SMEELS WONDERFUL I MOSTLY USE IT IN BATH WATER</li>
    <li> This is my first time buying oil. I needed it as an ingredient in a natural bug spray and haven&#x27;t used it yet because I forgot to pick up one last ingredient. I do keep it in my purse for days I feel an anxiety attack coming on and when I do I hold the bottle under my nose and it helps. 😆</li>
    <li> Great product, use it to relax before bedtime and works as needed.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, I put drops in my Epsom salt bath, and, relax.  You just need a little, will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!  Works well in my body lotion and misting spray!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great lavender oil!</li>
    <li> I used the oil in my epsom salt baths that I take a few times a week, the scent was very soothing and helped with the salt drying my skin out as much.  It was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I have been using this in my diffuser every night since it came and have been sleeping GREAT!</li>
    <li> Shipped very fast. I don&#x27;t know much about this stuff, but ordered for my wife and she absolutely loves it!</li>
    <li> This is my first oil purchase! I enjoy putting this in a difusser and feeling the immediate relaxation that it brings on. The scent is not too strong and it helps me fall asleep faster. I love this product and will keep purchasing this in the future.</li>
    <li> I relie so much on Amazon reviews that I had to write just to let anyone ordering this product to know what they are getting and I understand I should have looked further but the reviews were so solid.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the oil because my wife has cancer and I wanted to give her a massage.  The oil was not that easy to use as it dried up quickly.  I was really amazed at how little there was in the bottle...may have been my ignorance when ordering...&lt;br /&gt;It was just not that easy to use as I thought all oils would be basically the same.  I would not order it again.</li>
    <li> Pungent and delightful in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> This did not smell like lavender, more like pine-sol floor cleaner. It is unusable.</li>
    <li> I have only started using this product but so far I am very happy with it.  Mostly, use it for mediation and help with sleep.</li>
    <li> I received my lavender oil today. I was so excited to open the bottle so I could find out if I would love this particular oil. I am very pleased with the aroma and I am so excited to use this product. This was the scent I was looking for. I am interested in reading the e-book that I received along with my purchase. I love it when a company makes sure it&#x27;s new customers have a little help getting started using their product.</li>
    <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Lavender Essential Oil for relaxation and stress relief. This is my first time using this brand of lavender oil. Before I take a bath, I add a few drops with Epsom Salt. I then soak for awhile. My body gets sore from a accident I had a couple years ago. These baths help a lot. I do this a couple times a week. My skin feels wonderful after these bathes. I also use the oil in my diffuser.  After a relaxing bath, I put a couple drops in the diffuser and the aroma fills my room.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been to a spa</li>
    <li> love it. i put a couple drops on my hands and rub it up my neck and chest, makes me sleep like a baby at night. thanks for the great product. the shipping was pretty fast too.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, lavender oil can have a sour or bitter twinge and sometimes it is quite diluted.  None of this applies to this oil which is excellent.  It reminds me of oils that I have bought in the south of France, in areas where lavender is produced, freshly processed and sold and still smells as if it had come straight from the earth.  I recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> Soothing and relaxing</li>
    <li> I mix it with organic cocoanut oil and use it as a night cream on my face. Sooths the skin and smells great.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this oil with the intention of using it in my homemade household cleaners, but I&#x27;ve actually used it mostly for dealing with acne problems! I&#x27;ve had a couple of very resilient pimples that keep coming back but ever since I started using WellnesScent Lavender oil, I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference! I love that I have a product so versatile and that I didn&#x27;t have to pay and arm and a leg for it!</li>
    <li> This Lavender oil has a pleasant scent and is easily absorbed.  The bottle is smaller than I expected, but still worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have used Lavender oil for years and recently ran out.  I looked over the reviews on Amazon and decided to try this oil.  What a pleasant surprise to experience this scent that is far superior to any Lavender oil that I can recall.  I use it as a bath oil and nighttime relaxation aid and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> To say that I &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; this product is a bit of an over-statement; however, I don&#x27;t know how else to describe this oil.  Aside from the fact that it smells like a cleaning solvent, the bottle arrived damaged - and the &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; essential oil booklet (as described in the description) was no where to be found.</li>
    <li> works and smells great</li>
    <li> I Use this oil in my hair, along with other essential oils. So far, so good. My scalp feels clean and moisturized.</li>
    <li> First time user...and was told to try lavender oil for a variety of needs (relaxation, menopausal issues)and I must say a very satisfied and will be purchasing this brand again. Thanks sooo much</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Even better - I emailed to ask a question and got a speedy personal response! Loved the oil - used it to make salt scrubs as valentines gifts for my knitting group - they loved them! Truly happy with this purchase and will buy again!!!!</li>
    <li> Not much to say other than this product has a perfect lavender aroma.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used lavender oil before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I am very pleased with this product. I too put it on my pulse points after a shower and I have drifted off to sleep after only a few minutes. I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Great oil. Smells beautiful and helps calm both me and my dogs. I use it in the bedroom to create ambiance before sleep &amp; also burn it in the bathroom while i take shower. Love this oil!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and she completely loves it!! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really is great, will order it again, I have been using Lavender scent to help me sleep for several years, this is one of the greatest values out there.  Only a couple of drops in my small spray bottle of water and it helps me relax, spray on bed and pillows been sleeping good!</li>
    <li> This is not a very high quality lavender oil. I have not checked the origin of the oil, but it does not seem to have been produced from the best lavender plants. The method of extraction also does not seem to be the best one.  Low fragrance, rather dull, does not feel it has strong aromatherapeutic effect. The best quality lavender comes from British companies and best extractions from plants grown in places like France, or the Balkans. This is certainly very pedestrian.</li>
    <li> Finally a good nite&#x27;s sleep!</li>
    <li> The shipment arrived very quickly. I absolutely love the smell of this oil. I use it for bath tub ( place few drops), steam ironing ( place few drops). I plan to use it in my home made face creams and lip balms.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected. I am a novice oil buyer but based on other reviews it sounded like going organic was my best bet to ensure getting a quality product. I was not disappointed. I bought this to scent homemade laundry powder I made for holiday gifts. It smells divine. Very strong scent, good bang for the buck.</li>
    <li> I have always heard how lavendar oil is a natural healer.  I was glad to find this product.  It is very good</li>
    <li> Excellent.  So soothing and does amazing things for your skin.  Also wonderfully soothing for stress and/or pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I use this product to help relax my two toddlers at nighttime when they go to bed. One drop on each girls pillow case and my two girls are usually peacefully asleep in half an hour or less. My husband and myself use it to help with restless nights. Lavender oil makes a great alternative to sleeping drugs. The scent is soothing, and works wonders in our household!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful mixed in your bath water along with Epson salt and baking soda. Its creates the feeling of your own little spa right in your bathroom.  I would recommend buying some.</li>
    <li> I suffer from mild to moderate eczema on my back and chest and Lavender oil was recommend to me to help calm my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has been a big help with calming my skin.  I put it on after using Tea Tree oil at night and the Lavender scent is very calming to my skin and helps me sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend 100% purchasing this oil from this seller.</li>
    <li> The oil arrived on time and safely packaged.  I use it primarily to control the itch of insect bites -- hydrocortisone doesn&#x27;t help.  If I put it on the bites at night, it helps me sleep two ways.  First it controls the itching and second the smell is relaxing.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My first purchase of essential oils and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Great product and vendor. Thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent service. High quality product.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is not exactly what I was expecting but it&#x27;s okay.  I did not get the E Book that was advertised with it but once I contacted the company with my order # it was emailed to me right away.  I like the E Book as I&#x27;m just learning about essential oils.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and as promised. Works well for adding sent to bath salts.</li>
    <li> The oil is good quality and a great value.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery, nothing negative to say here.</li>
    <li> Really good and crisp lavender scent.  Definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> The oil is great; I plan on using it to heal the various kitchen burns I get while cooking.</li>
    <li> As expected. fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I LOVE both the lavender and peppermint!!!  The smell is wonderful! The price is great! The results are so awesome!!!&lt;br /&gt;My favorites!!!&lt;br /&gt;Also love the company!</li>
    <li> I mix a few drops in some water that I boil.... and steam my face while I smell that calming lavender for 10 minutes. It&#x27;s good for your skin too. It&#x27;s a nice pampering treat you can do for yourself.</li>
    <li> I personally found the aroma too strong for me to use in the way suggested. I have friends who like it very much so I think this is just my preference. I did notice that using a drop or two on a hanky near my pillow at bedtime seemed to improve my sleep but I felt too logged the next day. I plan to try it again with the hanky further away and see how that goes.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to add a nice scent to my oil cleansing blend. I use my blend to wash my face and neck. The lavender smell afterwards is so relaxing. A little goes a long way! I would recommend this oil to people with anxiety and/or trouble getting to sleep at night.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell and vey relaxing. I use this for aromatherapy.</li>
    <li> fast friendly service, the oil is amazing, I use it for my bath water and now am making my own body scrub with it as well, the scent is calming and pure.</li>
    <li> as described quickly shipped</li>
    <li> Amazing oil.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> This Lavender oil is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Great oil!  I use a few drops in my cool mist humidifier nightly to help my baby, husband, and I sleep better.  Very relaxing.</li>
    <li> Great product and great company!  The oil smells beautiful. I used it to make my own soap and it&#x27;s lovely.  Thanks for the great experience!</li>
    <li> Good price for an essential oil.</li>
    <li> I love the scent!  I used it mixed with baking soda to put on my carpet.  That was not why I bought it, but let me just say that my whole kitchen smells wonderful and the dogs are so relaxed!  I have had comments from my neighbors about how great my kitchen smells!  I am directing them to Wellness Scent for their own orders!  Thank you! Again, I just love it!</li>
    <li> Super strong scent. Very small bottle but you only need a drop to smell like lavender EVERYWHERE.</li>
    <li> Strong scent that doesn&#x27;t wear off quickly.</li>
    <li> I have not cared much for the scent of lavender oil in the past, and it is still not my favorite scent, but I have been using it in fractionated coconut oil  on my skin at night after my Epson Salt 20-min. bath. And along with a set of good ear plugs I have been sleeping a little better lately.</li>
    <li> I will update this review once product is received, but wanted to praise WellensScent for their excellent customer service.  The company reached out for feedback on Amazon shipping times and general satisfaction with the product.  After hearing we had unknowingly discarded the oil upon arrival (it was in a big box with other Amazon stuff), I was assured that a replacement was on the way.  Unnecessary but totally appreciated!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have already told several friends about it. Thanks for a wonderful product it truly does what I brought it for smell wise and medicinal wise as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It smells awesome...I&#x27;m not quite sure what I can do with it, so as of now I just jab on a bit here and there before work.</li>
    <li> Shipped fast! Good value, lavender, and peppermint 10 drops of each in a warm air mister will help you sleep better than sleeping pills,,,and there are no bad side effects!</li>
    <li> This Lavendar oil is very nice. I will purchase from this company again. You should try it for yourself. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> drops way too fast, you always get minimum of 5-10 drops. otherwise the oil is best quality. and lavender itself is an amazing plant</li>
    <li> I like this oil, I used it for my home made cream. I used 4oz. unrefined Shea butter, 2TBSP coconut oil, 4TBSP Grapeseed oil and 10 drops of Lavender essential oil. Turned out really well!</li>
    <li> This is a superior brand to ones I have bought previously.  It is especially good for my intestinal ailments as a topical soother, for colds and many other uses.  I love this oil!</li>
    <li> very nice - there&#x27;s cheaper out there but this is the real thing.  I add a few drops to generic Argan oil for face or hair and make it wonderful to use.  Add a drop or two into any face or body oil or lotion and enjoy.</li>
    <li> It is something so far that has been a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a scented spray linen I found on brightnest. My wife loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is my first purchase of an oil like this, the quality seems good but pricey as all get out. Again not sure if it is the norm in price.</li>
    <li> Loved this we use it in our salon and spa!!</li>
    <li> too small and the strong smell is really potent.  A few drops and it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lavender.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product and I love it!</li>
    <li> I add a very small amount to my inner wrist at night. It&#x27;s strong but a very pleasant smell and I find it relaxing.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I bought some for my 80+ year old mom since she fell in the  love with the idea of using lavender oil when she came to visit me once. She rubs it on her pillowcase and a little on her pulse points before going to bed. I also place some in a glass of warm water on my desk at work. Oh and I acted as a &amp;#34;family doula&amp;#34; to my niece when she gave birth to my great niece, I used some in an aromatherapy plug in to help create a peaceful environment...the obstetrician said that it smelled amazingly good in the birth room. This particular product has a clean, fresh fragrance and it is not over powering at all. I highly recommend it. I also appreciate the resources shared upon purchase!</li>
    <li> very nice.  just bought a second one.</li>
    <li> I am using the lavender oil to help with migraine headaches.  I have put several drops of the lavender oil on cotton balls and my house smells wonderful and I believe it is helping with my headaches.</li>
    <li> I do not have a ton of experience with buying lavender oil but so far this one is the brand I like the most.  It smells wonderful.  I put a drop or two on the back of my neck and shoulders before going to bed.  It helps those muscles relax and the scent is relaxing.  I thought about diluting it in a carrier oil but it is so easy to get a drop or two at a time from the bottle that I might not need to dilute it.  I only wanted to dilute it so that I would not have to fight with too much oil coming out of the bottle (what a mess) and over-using or wasting it.  But so far no problems with any of that.  When I need more I will order more of this brand from this company.  Bonus...They have great customer service if you have questions.</li>
    <li> High quality oil. Smells divine as well.</li>
    <li> Is it usda certified organic?</li>
    <li> Mine is actually the peppermint but it&#x27;s been great- seems potent.....</li>
    <li> A great item and shipping was very fast.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> The lavender scent was strong and lasted a long time for my &amp;#34;soak!&amp;#34;  I found it to be relaxing and good for my skin.  I would definitely purchase this or another scent from this company!!  Thank  you!</li>
    <li> Use the lavender oil with my bath salts and even to help alleviate sinus pressure. Wonderful product.. Will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> My order was processed and shipped promptly. The oil seems very high quality and has a wonderful, &amp;#34;true lavendar&amp;#34; aroma. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!  I HAVE BADLY BRUISED THE MUSCLES AND LIGAMENTS IN MY UPPER BODY!  I HAVE BEEN TAKING AN ANTI-INFLAMITORY DRUG~~~I WASN&#x27;T CRAZY ABOUT THE POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF THIS DRUG!  A GOOD FRIEND RECOMMENDED USING THE LAVENDER OIL BECAUSE IT WILL HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS THE DRUG I WAS TAKING BUT BECAUSE IT IS AN ALL NATURAL PRODUCT THERE ARE NO SIDE EFFECTS!  THE MINUTE I RUBBED THIS PRODUCT ON MY ARMS AND SHOULDERS  I COULD FEEL INSTANT RELIEF!  IT TRULY IS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item along with Epsom Salts. Had read that this combo was a great cure for winter dry skin. Loved the relaxing and rejuvenating pampering. Saved time running to specialty store to find. Plus lugging heavy containers of Epsom salts from store to house. Just opened the front door and there everything was waiting. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this Lavender! Great quality and a whole lot cheaper than Young Living Lavender oil. Lavender is an everyday oil with thousands of uses and I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Lavender, not just for its aromatic properties, but also because of its healing potential.  If you get a small cut or a scratch, you can put a small amount of Lavender on the cut and it will sting a little bit, but then the pain goes away totally.  It is the best and fastest means I know of healing small cuts or scratches! It&#x27;s also supposed to be good for burns, high blood pressure, skin issues, used as a natural anti-histamine, for allergies, insomnia, and nosebleed. Check it out!  I know people that use it as deodorant and for perfume! :D</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, used it  in a spray bottle with a little water . Sprayed over pillows and linens. My children slept very deeply, my husband felt relaxed and commented on the wonderful scent all over the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;Also mixed it in with my favorite moisturizer my skin loved it. Will keep a bottle in the patio I heard lavender oil is good to keep mosquitos away...</li>
    <li> Excellent, pure oil.  I am Reiki Master and use just a drop in my healing sessions.  I also use a drop on my &#x27;sleep pillow&#x27; to aid my own sleep.</li>
    <li> i like it. it is very good for me to use.&lt;br /&gt; the smell is laso good, i like it so much.</li>
    <li> I add this oil to my own kids baby shampoo, I make a bed linen spray so we can all get restful nights sleep, I add it to my homemade dryer sheets, and I am the process of figuring out a dishwashing soap and will be adding it to that as well!! It smells wonderful and I would order this oil again from this buyer! IT is great!</li>
    <li> The product itself is just fine and came as promised. However, I bought it after reading about its alleged benefits for the skin and found out very quickly that this should NOT be used on skin/face. I typically use coconut oil and vitamin E combo as a lip balm and added a couple drops of the lavender. After using I noticed that within hours my lips became severely chapped and as soon as I realized that it was the lavender I immediately stopped using it and my lips are back to normal. Do not use this on your skin.</li>
    <li> I love essential oils and always forget to buy at the store.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered tho.  I use to make homemade coconut oil moisturizing and this was perfect.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The oil was exactly as represented and I will enjoy using it.  I&#x27;ll make a linen spray from it and will expect better sleep!</li>
    <li> Great company, very personal and really fast shipping! This lavender is a little more &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; than what I think most people are used to.  However, I am not sure most people are aware of how many varieties of lavender there are.  I have lavender in my front yard that has a delightful eucalyptus scent and my backyard lavender is super floral and sweet. I love the scent, I think it&#x27;s perfect for taking baths, I feel grounded and relaxed every time.  I have a large bathtub and bathroom so I add 8-12 drops each time and it&#x27;s divine.  I shower after each bath and I my friends and family can smell a hint of lavender on me usually.  I will continue to purchase my EO from this company.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me sorry to say.</li>
    <li> Essence of lavender oil is a pleasant way to relax. A little of it added to to Baby oil gives me a great whole body moisturizer, sometimes even a deodorant; and at the same time I enjoy the exquisite luxury of the heavenly scent of lavender. This is especially good when my own lavender plants are not in bloom.</li>
    <li> This essential oil is fantastic. Perfect aroma and highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s the real deal and the price is quite reasonable. I suggest putting a few drops in the liquefied wax of an unscented candle for a nice, even dispersal in any room. I highly recommend this product and will certainly turn to WellnesScent again, in the future.</li>
    <li> I like the oil very much.  Along with others, I wish the small bottle had a dropper rather than the drip top, however that is probably more expensive.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  You know the oil is true lavendar because it&#x27;s stored in a brown bottle.  Fake oils are in clear bottles.  Steer clear and purchase from a reputable seller like this one</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil it does exactly what the company says it does it soothes me.</li>
    <li> I use the Lavender oil at my office with reeds to create a lovely smelling workspace, instead of those nasty \\&quot;fragrance oil plug-ins\\&quot; that can be loaded with hundreds of toxic chemicals.  Co-workers like to come into my closed space because of how it smells.</li>
    <li> Smells great - love it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff,. Very strong, you can tell its pure. I have used many other brands and this so far seems excellent!</li>
    <li> I use this as a part of my homeopathic treatment of psoriasis. It is soothing. It is gentle enough to be used without a carrier oil on one&#x27;s skin, but I use it with coconut oil anyway, since I have sensitive skin. I prefer lavender to harsh chemicals found in commercial or prescription moisturizers.</li>
    <li> I love the Lavender Oil...I rub it on my feet before going to bed and I also mix it with coconut oil and massage my scalp.</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is wonderful! I use 10 drops in a 16oz brown glass spray bottle to mist my dreadlocks which keeps my hair hydrated without getting greasy and smells great. Adding some tea tree oil is nice too. This oil has a great smell and potency which can be hard to find. It came a day ahead of the estimated delivery date which is also a plus. I will be buying again when I run out!</li>
    <li> Very good smell of the flowers, I just put it drops on the pillow, sleep is particularly good, long sleep, I can&#x27;t eat sleeping pills, will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product!  AND a fabulous seller who responds to all inquiries in a timely manner. Just a little dab will do the trick!&lt;br /&gt;A+++++++!!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful!! We use it on our wool dryer balls and our laundry comes out smelling lightly of lavender. Really very nice.</li>
    <li> When reviewing different Lavender oils, I came across someone who indicated that you should be sure to get the species &amp;#34;officinalis&amp;#34;.  I would agree. Rather than just a weak floral scent, you get more of a plant scent (earthier and more pleasing).  I use this on the soles of my feet at night to help with sleep.  It is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one problem that I have with all of these essential oils bottles (regardless of brand): they do not dispense easily and some of the oil rolls down the sides of the bottle, and once opened, they will leak if not upright.</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil. I use it in a tart burner with water and it fills the surrounding rooms with an heavenly fragrance. I also put a few drops on a cotton ball along with lemon essential oil in the bag of the vacuum cleaner. It makes the vacuuming chore more pleasant thanks to the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil to use specifically in a DIY facial moisturizer and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  I&#x27;ve also used it straight from the bottle to apply to the insides of my wrists and then I rub my wrists on my pillow case to provide a calming, restful mode to help me get to sleep.  I am very satisfied with the quality of this oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using lavender essential oil for many years.  This brand is really nice--good, strong, clean scent.  I use it everywhere, especially on my dog to help keep his skin under control.  It really helps his itching and prevents hot spots.  I put a drop or two on my hands, rub together and cup over my face and breathe deeply.  Verrrrry relaxing!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing. Such a lovely relaxing smell. I add it to my bathwater which makes it smell wonderful and my skin feels great. I use it on my pulse points it is very relaxing amd eases tension. It smells like real lavender, potent but not overpowering. I am sure it will be useful as a bug repellent come warmer weather and right now in the thick of a Maine wintah it is helpiing keep the blues away. I also put some on my pillow it has really eased me into a peaceful sleep. I put some on my son&#x27;s stuffed animal he sleeps with and it seems to chase the boogie man away, no more bad dreams;-) thanks wellnesscent I will definately purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering from WellnesScent.  I am so happy and pleased with the quality and scent.  I too have used it on my wrist at night and even a cotton pad under my pillow slip.  The best sleep and most restful sleep I&#x27;ve have in a very long time.  Actually the scent lasted a few days.  I&#x27;m new to essential oils and learning how to make blends and the uses for each oil.  Lavender is a favorite scent of mine so this was one of first for me to order.  Great company, quality product.  I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I like it! The smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to you guys really.&lt;br /&gt;I think I will buy it again in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like this lavender oil. It&#x27;s a great price and really strong scented. I used it to make holiday gifts and everyone was really pleased. I will be buying it again as I&#x27;m almost out.</li>
    <li> I use Lavender every day and this was one I wanted to try as an alternative to YL.  Great smell and feel to it, and exceptional value. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This oil truly smells like lavender and not like fake, cheap imitations.  It works great for aromatherapy uses such as relaxing soaks in the bathtub, and a little dab here and there.  The scent is strong but very pleasing.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lavender and am very happy with my purchase. I wasn&#x27;t able to open the ebook though so I&#x27;m not very happy about that.</li>
    <li> I love this lavendar oil, which not only smells good but helps me sleep (by putting a drop behind each ear before bed).</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this lavender oil! Over the years I have tried numerous brands and have been &amp;#34;content&amp;#34;. I have to say that I have finally found a winner! I use lavender oil to create &amp;#34;scent packets&amp;#34; that I place in my dresser drawers and linen closet to keep the musty smells away. Generally the lovely smell fades after a week, not with Wellness Scent! After a week the scent is just as pleasantly strong as the day I placed the scent packets. Of course I have only had this lavender oil for a week, but it has already exceeded my expectation! Just found a recipe for a body scrub online, so I will be trying this product in that as well. I will definitely be ordering again.</li>
    <li> My mother suffers from terrible headaches and putting some of this oil on her temples has helped a great deal.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and smells great!  I recommend this to anyone looking for essential oils.  I plan to use it to make a linen spray.</li>
    <li> Very good product! I add a few drops in our humidifier &amp; it helps my little ones breath better on the cold dry winter nights or when they get a cold/dry coughs.</li>
    <li> Very nice smell, not irritating when applied neat to the skin. I will purchase this oil again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of lavender! I want to use this oil to help me relax and unwind in the evening and it works, the aroma is long lasting, a little on my pillow works wonders. Another use is for my doggies, one in particular gets really stressed when I leave for even a short while. I put a drop in the palm of my hand and simply stroke his head. In a very short time he relaxes ! Definitely recommend :)</li>
    <li> I was extremely satisfied when I used this product, i used it to make a cleaning solution for my baby&#x27;s cloth wipes. I just used 5 drops and honestly I think 2 or three drops would have been enough cause is so concentrated. The scent is delicious not overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  I put 5 drops into my diffuser each night and sleep heavenly!  Definitely PURE oil!  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Really did not have a natural scent, was very overpowering even in the tiniest application..  Would not, unfortunately, recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product was way too strong for my senses. Purchased it to help with sleep but had to wash much off as it was distracting and not comforting. Being a person who can&#x27;t stand the smell of perfume because it gives me a headache I probably should have known better.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful essential oil. Lavender is my favorite and I am always searching for the best and freshest oils out there. The price is really great and well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It is very nice natural fragrance of lavender. I am using for skin. I believe it works wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I received my shipment very quick!</li>
    <li> This oil is a wonderful product, It small so good, I use it in my bath water and I love it.</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is a perfect addition to my glycerine spritzers.  You don&#x27;t need to add much to get a nice scent. Thank you!</li>
    <li> All of the oils I received are wonderful .I have used them straight out of the bottle and mixed with coconut oil . I am looking forward to trying others. It is so nice to have scents that doesn&#x27;t poisin the air like commercial air freshener . And I like organic products  because you know it is safe to use.</li>
    <li> I find the aroma very pleasant.  I have used it in a diffuser and directly on my skin.  I find it very soothing.  I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> product is entirely to strong! it over took my entire house, I could not sit in a bath with it and relax!</li>
    <li> Great quality! Fast service!</li>
    <li> A dear friend loves the fragrance of lavender.  Made her both salt scrub and homemade hand cream using your oil.&lt;br /&gt;They smell wonderful.  She was so pleased with her gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Also found an article with directions for using lavender oil on my dogs to both calm them and as a insect repellent.&lt;br /&gt;Look forward to exploring more uses for this wonderful smelling oil. Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a while for a lavender that smells true to form, and this one is it! You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> very dissatisfied for $10.00 the bottle it was pretty small</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this as a recommendation from my vet to combat a horrendous flea problem.  All the expensive doggie treatments just weren&#x27;t working so she recommended going holistic to see what would happen.  The lavender is supposed to make the dog&#x27;s blood taste so horrendous that the fleas would leave.  Well, it doesn&#x27;t work.  Fleas still around...  BUT having used essential oils many times in the past, I now use it to freshen my throw rugs all over the house (the scent combats the all too common &amp;#34;doggy&amp;#34; smell that can build up on the rugs sometimes).  A few drops on each rug every few days actually beats the need to keep buying those expensive Glad air fresheners!  So, my doggie is still fighting with the fleas, but my house smells wonderful for a lot less money.  :-)</li>
    <li> Great stuff, long lasting scent, thanks</li>
    <li> Great to put on the soles of your feet at night to help you sleep...very relaxing quality!</li>
    <li> I think scents are a personal thing, and what one person likes, another person doesn&#x27;t.  With that said, I don&#x27;t really care for the smell; and, as far as it being relaxing, it did nothing for me.  Nothing against the product itself, just not for me.</li>
    <li> If you are going to get only one essential oil it should be Lavender! I love this lavender, first thing that is important to me is the oil doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my cloths. I love the smell and that it is pure lavender oil. I use this oil each night on my daughters feet to help her relax and fall asleep. Also when I have allergies I use this oil on my cheek bones and the allergies seem to disappear! I would highly recommend this product. I was given a slight discount to review this product.</li>
    <li> love this , got to me quickly , will be buying more</li>
    <li> While I would prefer to see some more definitive organic label, I will say that I am not disappointed with the product. I love the scent and it for what I am using it for (cleaning products &amp; Eczema care) it works just fine. I am not an essential oil expert but I do use it for a few things in our household. The packaging is great and I just purchase glass eye droppers and pop off the plastic \\&quot;drop\\&quot; insert for less waste and better dispensing. Overall I love the product and would recommend it.    Update 2/17/15 Been using this for a couple of weeks and it is a wonderful oil. Kids find it very pleasant and it is working great on our kid with mild eczema patches (mixed with coconut oil). Love the scent and it seems to be very pure...no residue left on clothes, etc.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal. Strong, good scent. You can find an equivalent volume bottle of lavender oil for much cheaper, but it must be made of something else because it smells entirely different. Nothing compares to real lavender scent.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I put it in a diffuser to help me sleep.  You can also put in the bottoms of your feet or on your neck.</li>
    <li> Great scent, just what I was looking for for a homemade bug spray. The regulator piece on the bottle opening is super helpful and I can easily count how many drops I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this lavender oil by Wellness Scent. It is highly concentrated so a little goes a long way. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> Delightful!  Light and works so well in my homemade creams!</li>
    <li> This is a good lavender oil. Would order again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. The oil is very fresh and the scent is long lasting. It doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, if that makes sense. My daughter used a drop on a favorite stuffed animal to relax before and after surgery- it seemed to help.</li>
    <li> This product has a strange after-smell, almost like pine.  It actually smells like a cleaning product.  I had to wash it off after about an hour because the smell made me nauseaus.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for few weeks for me and my kids before bedtime. Just to help relax before bedtime. The smell is wonderful and I it works great. I don&#x27;t think smells lasts for a long time, but I am not sure if any of the oils do... I am only judging by not feeling any of it in am when I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;In any case I am buying two more bottles to keep in different bedrooms, so that we don&#x27;t have to bring it from room to room.</li>
    <li> I used this on dryer balls, which I kept in lingerie drawers, when not being used in the dryer.  I have no complaints with the product, but may look for a lower price.</li>
    <li> looking forward to this! Nail Biting &amp; Thumb sucking discouraging liquid---what??? very 1st problem with Amazon- don&#x27;t understand just what happened. I do know there is a difference between the two?!</li>
    <li> I use lavender oil to stop the itches from bug bites, allergies, etc., because it works so well.</li>
    <li> This has a wonderful lavender scent without feeling super greasy. I like to use some of this before bed for the relaxing effect that lavender is known to produce. It has subtle but wonderful scent, so it isn&#x27;t overpowering but still has enough scent to do its job. I would definitely recommend this brand to others.</li>
    <li> Not quite up to my lavender essential oil standards. To me...it seems like perhaps a little fragrance oil was mixed in.BUT I don&#x27;t know!</li>
    <li> I just love pure oils. I purchased this to use for soaking in a bath but have not done so yet. I have mixed it with other fragrant oils to burn in my oil burning diffuser.  I have no complaints and may no doubt purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I put a drop of the oil on our pillows every night. We sleep better. Also put it in coconut oil, 3-6 drops. Very soothing on dry, tired skin.</li>
    <li> This Lavender oil smells great. I use it on my pillow and also mix it with my skin lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It puts me in a peaceful, calming state.</li>
    <li> I was sadly disappointed in the strength of the product.  The scent did not last long. I&#x27;ve never purchased oil online before.</li>
    <li> This smells so good and it&#x27;s 100% pure!  My daughter loves a few drops on her pillow at night, to help her sleep. I&#x27;ll also mix a few drops with coconut oil and rub on my 2yr old feet, and back, to help him sleep.</li>
    <li> I just ordered a second bottle I used it in a detox bath it worked great made me feel so relax I also use it on my stress knots on my back. My point is you will get your money worth</li>
    <li> I am new to essential oils. I have read, and researched about them to the point of frustration . Everyones opinions seemingly vary as to the best brands, the smells and strengths of smells, buying only therapeutic oil, potency...etc! Personally it seems theres a lot of contradictions in the essential oil world. Makes ya wonder if you ever truly know the quality of the oil your getting, and if itll truly work. After searching through tons of different brands and reading reviews of people arguing over what brand is best, and reading that organic therapeutic is the way to go along with that your supposed to pay attention to the methods being used to process when choosing a company.......lord!! I decided it all seems a gamble to me.I just decided to try this and hope for the best.I havent used it yet but i can say that me and my mom love the smell!</li>
    <li> Best Lavender I&#x27;ve purchased!</li>
    <li> I am using this a a toner mixed with witch hazel and I love it! I have tried other brands of lavender oil and this is the best one!</li>
    <li> This lavender oil is amazing!! I added some to my bath last night and the aroma filled my entire house. Granted my house is small but still! I love lavender and this oil is very good quality.</li>
    <li> it smells really lovely. I am hoping to use it for pain relief or at least to help me to relax.</li>
    <li> This was a present for someone very selective of their oils. This is their absolute most favorite lavender oil!  I will reorder this again!</li>
    <li> This is a quality grade lavender oil.  I mix it with vanilla to create a personal scent, and it smells really great.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> The Oil 100% Natural Pure Undiluted Lavender Oil is not what I expected.  The smell is strange.</li>
    <li> I wanted some natural scents for my bathrooms. Tried scented soaps but the scent evaporated quickly and the soap got goopy. So I purchased a couple of essential oils and placed a few drops on the ends of the extra toilet paper rolls I keep in baskets in my bathrooms and WOW I can smell the scents throughout the house. I&#x27;m finding this a very economical way to freshen my house and I love customizing the scents for the different bathrooms. So far, I&#x27;m loving lavender and peppermint together and I just ordered lemon and grapefruit essential oils for citrus scents. The possibilities are endless and the fragrances are not over powering or fake smelling. The scent on this particular lavender is very true, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Lasts a long time and doesnt seem to stain</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is a chronic insomniac so I purchased this oil hoping to relax him so he could sleep.  I added it to sweet almond oil and massaged it into his back.  He slept the whole night through!  I am more than happy with my purchase and will buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE NOTE: A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful oil. A friend suggested I use it on blisters; my thumbs have healed beautifully. I love this scent; it is very relaxing in the evening. Thank you for a great product.</li>
    <li> Great for sleep and muscle aches!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful! Just a dab brings a long lasting aroma. very relaxing! Price was very reasonable too.</li>
    <li> great product! i use this for a lot of things..my bath, i put some on my chest to help panic attacks- or just open the bottle and breathe in deeply, great for helping to relax and sleep as well. I have added some to some fading sachet&#x27;s and it revived them right up making all my personals lovely and fragrant</li>
    <li> Great service. Great product.  I am very happy. Thanks</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice smell !! love it.</li>
    <li> Have put this into oil for massage mix, as well as spray with witch hazel. No issues, but have not put it into use.</li>
    <li> I have used this oil as a diffuser, for my headache and in my bath. It is the best pure peppermint oil I have ever purchased. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for some great pure peppermint oil. Great product. Deliver was quick.</li>
    <li> Amazing quality, works so well for sleep aid,</li>
    <li> I have loved this oil. I am planning a natural childbirth and I practice my breathing and relaxation techniques while diffusing this lavender oil in the air. It has been so great for me! I can relax almost instantly. I am looking forward to using this scent to help me relax while in labor.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this brand of lavender oil!  There are so many uses for lavender oil, it&#x27;s definitely a staple in my house.  I&#x27;ve put it on burns (totally makes it heal faster!), made linen spray, bath salts, bug repellent, mix with avocado oil for massages, and even mix a drop with a bit of organic rose hip oil and use it as a night moisturizer on my face.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Robust fragrance of lavender. Reasonably priced. Wish it had a eye dropper dispenser. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pricey but worth it to me because I am so into aromatherapy.  Just a tiny drop on pulse points helps me relax and sleep at night.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I decided to order this.  I place a few drops on my pillowcase and fall right to sleep. I used to wake up around 5 A.M. and now wake up around 6:30 A.M.</li>
    <li> This is another bad lavender oil and I agree with one of review&#x27;s comment.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Does not smell like lavender, more like pine-sol floor cleaner&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can learn the dirty secret of industry like this from online.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;Grown in China, Russia, France and Tasmania, then they bring it into France, cut it with synthetic linolyl acetate to improve the fragrance, add propylene glycol or SD 40, DEP, and DOP, which are solvents that have no smell and increase the volume, then sell it in the U.S. as lavender oil.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;There is no good oil in Amazon&amp;#34; .......an another Amazon member(CA) contacted and told me.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that is ridiculous, but now I am doing the same thing as her...buying oils from somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How ignorant I was, But I am learning a lot from online nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;@Most interesting site created by a house wife:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The Great Essential Oils Showdown ~ Which Essential Oils Company is Best?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;@If you are very serious like me this site is the one to check:&lt;br /&gt;“The quaily of essential oil”  (by Jade Shutes - BA, Dipl. AT., Cert. Herbalist)</li>
    <li> HEAVENLY , VERY PLEASED WITH THE SCENT.</li>
    <li> Great quality! It was delivered earlier than I expected.</li>
    <li> My lavender oil was shipped to me very fast. The smell is great and works wonders for what I use it for. Would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> To me it smells like lavender and is as relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to stay up until 2ish in the morning on my computer, long after I completed the needed tasks. I even set up my malware (which needs Firefox/whatever closed, just so I&#x27;d have to go to bed) to curtail my time--and quickly discovered a way to pause the program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use just a tad of this lavender oil on the bridge of my nose after my nighttime routine. Come midnight, I&#x27;m wanting to stop writing reviews. Even this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I accidentally use too much, it irritates my nose &amp; doesn&#x27;t smell good. I&#x27;d guess this product &amp;#34;should be&amp;#34; diluted by using an essential oil diffuser. I like mine straight.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I have bought this oil several times now and I&#x27;m addicted. I use it for a lot of different things. When my allergies are bothering me I dab some on my wrists or just open the bottle and inhale and it helps me stop sneezing. I use it in my oil burner at work and the whole office smells wonderful. I mix it with purified water and spray my bed sheets and pajamas and sleep like a baby. The oil doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell that a lot of the oils have and it&#x27;s not an overpowering smell either. If you like lavender this is the oil for you.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, nice texture.  It really helps me get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly and I use a couple of drops in a small dish by my nightstand to help me relax and fall asleep.  It&#x27;s delightful and I just ordered two more bottles!</li>
    <li> excellent product it exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Thanks!  The card insert for e-book didn&#x27;t work for me, but you sent the link in an email which did work.</li>
    <li> I have never used essential oils before, but learned lavender works for both anxiety and headaches; both of which I have dealt with.  The lavender is working very well for both.  I am quite pleased.  Also very pleased this is an organic product.</li>
    <li> This is really nice Lavender Oil here with a very potent but pleasant scent. As a person with chronic sinusitis, I use it several times throughout the day to help me breath a bit better. Picture a natural Vick&#x27;s VapoRub type effect, but milder and more pleasant. An unexpected side effect was that it also works as a natural relaxant, almost like a low level Valium effect. That was a nice surprise. That wasn&#x27;t my target effect, but I&#x27;m very happy about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other useful information is that it arrives fast and the customer service is on point. They actually care that you are well pleased with their product. They demonstrably believe in, and stand behind their product. I share that sentiment as a consumer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is in response to my second order of this oil, as I was greatly pleased with my first bottle. I haven&#x27;t tried any other scents, but I may look into some Tea Tree Oil from this same company. You can buy with confidence that this Lavender Oil is the real deal. I&#x27;m using it this very moment as I type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars without question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace.</li>
    <li> This product is advertised as Organic and it is not Organic.  This is misleading to the consumer.</li>
    <li> Great product. Only wish it came in a larger container for the price. The lavender smell is pleasant &amp; does not have a chemical or artificial scent.</li>
    <li> This oil has a heavenly fragrance and immediately relaxes me. I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends and family who have trouble sleeping. I will shop with WellnesScent again as this product shows their commitment to quality. They also have excellent customer service!! A positive experience all around!</li>
    <li> Had a great long lasting fragrance.  I used this to make homemade potpourri!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just getting into the essential oiks so I&#x27;m novice on them, but I read a lot of reviews and settled on this product. I have really enjoyed it, I use it in a difuser and also topical mixed in a carrier oil. I would easily recommend this.</li>
    <li> quick delivery, great product</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Quick delivery</li>
    <li> it smells like cloves and not really lavender.. maybe if I use few drops it&#x27;ll smell better? I&#x27;m going to use this for my no-poo hair. ((attached photo of description on bottle. it says 100% pure lavender oil, read somewhere that it could mean other natural oils as long as lavender is 5% or somethinf, but idk if this one means that))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: CAN NOT CONTROL AMOUNT IT DROPS OUT AND SMELLS TERRIBLE. HATE THIS. CAN&#x27;T EVEN GET A REFUND FOR THIS STUPID THING THAT I&#x27;M NEVER GONNA USE AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I loved this and enjoy knowing I&#x27;m using organic products.</li>
    <li> 3rd lavender I bought and wont buy from anyone else again. Othe5rs too weak or did not smell like lavender.  love it.</li>
    <li> It smells good and good value!  Recommended!  I use this with a diffuser in a small room, and it penetrates nice aroma around the room.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great quality higly recommend it!</li>
    <li> My oil arrived quickly and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 other brands of lavender oil on Amazon and 1 from another site. This brand has a very nice balanced fragrance. It&#x27;s one of my 2 favorites, no woody undertone from stems not quite all removed before distillation and very pure lavender scent. I can sniff it straight from the bottle and it has a calming effect. My dog who loves to smell our lilac bush when it&#x27;s in bloom loves this oil too, he runs over to sniff it every time I use it.:)</li>
    <li> This is a good product and it arrived promptly.  It smells good and dispenses easily.  I have been using lavender oil for many years.  This is the first time I have tried this brand and I will order it again.  I have some on my skin now to soothe some itchy insect bites and am enjoying the scent.  Also I use lavender oil in my bath and in my laundry where it makes everything especially towels and sheets smell nice.  (To make my own fabric softener I put a few drops of oil in white vinegar and it works very well.  It is inexpensive and it does not have all the chemicals of commercial fabric softener so it is great for people with sensitive skin.)</li>
    <li> I was extremely happy with my purchase.  I made sugar scrub for a baby shower and this worked out perfectly, all the guests really loved it!  I would definitely purchase this again for my needs in the future.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much! Very well packaged and just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love lavender oil, this is a good brand. Perfect</li>
    <li> We love this oil for so many reasons, the biggest reason would be the fact that it relaxes us so well. We have it in diffusers throughout our home, in my car, which is nice when I&#x27;m fighting traffic.  Great product! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> A beautiful relaxing scent.  Couple it with Epson salts and baking soda in a hot bath and tension just pours off...</li>
    <li> I love lavender oil! I use this to help my kids sleep, and also for my seasonal allergy symptoms. Great price!</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Great stuff</li>
    <li> This is the best Lavender Oil I have found so far.  I have terrible insomnina and the smell of lavender helps me fall asleep.  I can&#x27;t say it works every night but I am sleeping better.  I noticed this oil seemed more pure and intense than another one I had purchased and works really well.  With this oil a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Stinks!  Awful smell and quality.</li>
    <li> Pure therapeutic organic grade oil with a natural lavender sent.</li>
    <li> Great service! I love lavender on the skin and in the air. This is a great product and a great brand.</li>
    <li> We have been using peppermint for sometime and were looking for something more affordable yet just a pure as some of the more expensive brands.  We use it for stomach, fevers and diffuse it in the air.  Put some in your vacuum filter while vacuuming and the whole whose smells so fresh.</li>
    <li> The scent is relaxing, and I use it with Epsom salts! So good for me!</li>
    <li> Works great for headaches!</li>
    <li> Definitely strong scent.  I love lavendar oil, and this seller sends a quality product. I recommend the product and the seller</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  Just lavender oil concentrated and good!  smells good, goes a long way!  great price too!  I bought 6 bottles and I make sprays, salts, and use as relaxing perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> Item came as promised and smells divine</li>
    <li> Nice scent and relaxing</li>
    <li> use on the bottoms of my feet right before bed and I sleep like a log!</li>
    <li> I received the product in good condition and before expected. It&#x27;s been wonderful for relaxing.</li>
    <li> High quality. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Very good oil; I have been using lavender oil for years but this is the best product I have ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;It has a fresh scent it reminds me the lavender fields around Avignon.</li>
    <li> I ordered two bottles of Wellness lavender oil because i knew that i was going to be using one whole bottle immediately upon arrival in my homemade facewash. The lavender oil smell adds the lady-like touch of my oil face wash.  It is lovely. I will use the other bottle to scent a aloe-shea lotion. It arrived very quickly I really appreciate that.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Helps me I wide and relax</li>
    <li> very strong, only need a few drops</li>
    <li> is very strong when you first put it on but, after 5 min. no scents at all</li>
    <li> It has a wonderful fragrance....very helpful!  Thank you!</li>
