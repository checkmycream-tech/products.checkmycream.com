      <li>Simply the best.</li>
      <li>Lapidus by Ted Lapidus which costs barelyUSD20, lasts more than 24 hrs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my all time favorite EDT &amp; the most value for money</li>
      <li>Heart notes are sophisticated.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an elegant mix of leather, oud, wood &amp; smoke.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>I love scented</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells on him and seems to work with his body chemistry.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very dark and has nice undertones and is perfect for date night when I snuggle up close.</li>
      <li>It is not that strong as everyone said.</li>
      <li>a sweet dark sexy fragrance that smells an ancient Arabian Palace, &amp; you&#x27;re the King surrounded by a harem of beautiful women.</li>
      <li>, they are now willing to buy it is very rich in its aroma</li>
      <li>When I first saw the CD Fahrenheit Absolute (FA), I assumed it will be a more stronger / intense version of the original.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s timeless, enigmatic &amp; sophisticated.</li>
      <li>I really liked but it is not true that this it &amp;#34;arrives before you in the place&amp;#34;, smell good but just to the people that come near to you, it is not that strong that everyone can smell from far away.</li>
      <li>The original CD Fahrenheit lasts much longer than this.</li>
      <li>Even the original CD Fahrenheit lasts much longer than this.</li>
      <li>Yes, U read that right.</li>
      <li>Far better to skip this, and buy the classic Fahrenheit - contrary to what others may tell you, there&#x27;s no way</li>
      <li>Does not even last more than 8 hrs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s heavily dominated by the sweet smell of oudh or agarwood, very popular in the middle east.  </li>
      <li>and I really like this</li>
      <li>im very upset</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s in these notes that they are so different in presentation from the original CD Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>It has loud first notes &amp; initial impression mildly resembles the original Christian Dior (CD) Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>Almost costs half more than CD Fahrenheit EDT.  </li>
      <li>A darker version of the classic Fahrenheit with incense...</li>
      <li>Very masculine, very bully.</li>
      <li>I was so wrong, I really liked the Fahrenheit Absolute when I tried it at a super mall.    </li>
      <li>I bought the 3.4oz bottle based on rave reviews on several fragrance review sites that this is even better than the classic Fahrenheit, which I also have, but discovered it smelling like a milder version of my Davidoff Hot Water, and not at all similar to the classic Fahrenheit, other than the color and shape of the bottle.</li>
      <li>This year I wanted to try something new.</li>
      <li>this new incarnation with its oudh dominance can dethrone the old classic Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>Can be very loud if used in summer.    </li>
      <li>Anyway, if you really like this type of fragrance, you should buy Davidoff&#x27;s Hot Water, which is even more intense than this, and since Hot Water is selling at half the price, you will be saving some serious money.</li>
      <li>Smells very church like with myrrh and frankincense elements being so obvious.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised to find that Amazon could get it for me.</li>
      <li>Sillage is consistent for the first few hrs.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s just not even worth half the listed price.</li>
      <li>For the money paid, I&#x27;d expect it to at least last a lil&#x27; more longer than this.</li>
      <li>I purchased this by mistake as it looks exactly like my other.</li>
      <li>Apparently this fragrance is discontinued.  </li>
      <li>It barely lasts 8 hrs.</li>
      <li>I never really liked the original CD Fahrenheit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very dark &amp; intense.</li>
      <li>One man&#x27;s good is another man&#x27;s bad.</li>

    <li> I bought the 3.4oz bottle based on rave reviews on several fragrance review sites that this is even better than the classic Fahrenheit, which I also have, but discovered it smelling like a milder version of my Davidoff Hot Water, and not at all similar to the classic Fahrenheit, other than the color and shape of the bottle.

Far better to skip this, and buy the classic Fahrenheit - contrary to what others may tell you, there&#x27;s no way this new incarnation with its oudh dominance can dethrone the old classic Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li> Apparently this fragrance is discontinued.  It was a gift and happily received.</li>
    <li> Excellent will buy more the Amazon service was excellent</li>
    <li> The good:    1) It has loud first notes &amp; initial impression mildly resembles the original Christian Dior (CD) Fahrenheit. Fortunately it&#x27;s not as loud as EDTs used in the Middle East though. Lol.  2) Heart notes are sophisticated. It&#x27;s an elegant mix of leather, oud, wood &amp; smoke. It&#x27;s very dark &amp; intense. Very masculine, very bully. Lol.  3) The base notes are very sweet &amp; woody. It&#x27;s in these notes that they are so different in presentation from the original CD Fahrenheit. Smells very church like with myrrh and frankincense elements being so obvious.  4) Sillage is consistent for the first few hrs.  5) Ideal for evening wear.    The bad:    1) Expensive. Almost costs half more than CD Fahrenheit EDT.  2) Does not even last more than 8 hrs. The original CD Fahrenheit lasts much longer than this. Hence lacks value for money.  3) Can be very loud if used in summer.    Conclusion:    I keep changing EDTs every now &amp; then. I&#x27;ve tried Jaipur by Boucheron, L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake, Obsession by Calvin Klein etc to name a few. The one brand of EDT that I keep coming back to, every time, is Lapidus by Ted Lapidus. It&#x27;s timeless, enigmatic &amp; sophisticated. It&#x27;s my all time favorite EDT &amp; the most value for money EDT I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s unbelievably priced at USD20 on Amazon. Yes, U read that right. Lol.    This year I wanted to try something new. I never really liked the original CD Fahrenheit. When I first saw the CD Fahrenheit Absolute (FA), I assumed it will be a more stronger / intense version of the original. I was so wrong, I really liked the Fahrenheit Absolute when I tried it at a super mall.    After using CD FA for a couple of weeks, I must admit that I regret spending close to USD90 on this EDT. It barely lasts 8 hrs. For the money paid, I&#x27;d expect it to at least last a lil&#x27; more longer than this. Even the original CD Fahrenheit lasts much longer than this. I have tried / used them both, side by side, to test this. Lapidus by Ted Lapidus which costs barelyUSD20, lasts more than 24 hrs. U can smell Lapidus on U&#x27;r clothes even after a month. Lol. I do not think I&#x27;d buy this EDT ever again. It&#x27;s a great EDT but it&#x27;s just not even worth half the listed price. Yawn!    EDTs are a matter of personal choice &amp; taste. One man&#x27;s good is another man&#x27;s bad. Buy&#x27;em only after U try&#x27;em.    Just my $0.02.    Brgds.</li>
    <li> This is the Dark Knight of the Fahrenheit collection...Myrrh, Incense, &amp; Oud ???...OMG this is the bomb !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a sweet dark sexy fragrance that smells an ancient Arabian Palace, &amp; you&#x27;re the King surrounded by a harem of beautiful women.</li>
    <li> A darker version of the classic Fahrenheit with incense...a great fall/winter fragrance.</li>
    <li> Good perfum, good deal!</li>
    <li> this is the second time i order something form amazon and it came broken this cologne came broken im very upset and i want my reufund. very bad</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with Dior for packaging this exactly like Fahrenheit &amp;#34;original&amp;#34;. I purchased this by mistake as it looks exactly like my other. It is completely different cologne and I do not like it. I have an expensive product that I will have to trash because I purchased the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe a disclaimer in the title should be &amp;#34;this is not Fahrenheit but a completely different cologne!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this before. He kept dropping hints about it around Christmas. I was surprised to find that Amazon could get it for me. He was very pleased. It arrived on time for him to get it.</li>
    <li> exquisite really love my walk I love scented and I really like this, people ask me a lot for this and I point out, they are now willing to buy it is very rich in its aroma</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance. It&#x27;s very dark and has nice undertones and is perfect for date night when I snuggle up close. I love the way it smells on him and seems to work with his body chemistry. Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Excellent product and distribición by supplier</li>
    <li> It is not that strong as everyone said. I really liked but it is not true that this it &amp;#34;arrives before you in the place&amp;#34;, smell good but just to the people that come near to you, it is not that strong that everyone can smell from far away.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne.I have used for years.Simply the best.This is one of two that i use and it has allways gotten me positice feed&lt;br /&gt;back from the women.</li>
