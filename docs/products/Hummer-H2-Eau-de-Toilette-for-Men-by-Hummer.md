      <li>I previously had an exact same Hummer 2 which was amazing, but this new one is outright watered down.</li>

<li> /&gt;Had it been for smell only, the product would have received somewhere around 4.5 stars, however it has serious longevity issues.</li>
<li> Upon arrival one of the box corners was smushed in as if they packed it a little too tight but am hoping the product itself is not damaged.</li>
<li> Been using it now for a few years.  </li>
