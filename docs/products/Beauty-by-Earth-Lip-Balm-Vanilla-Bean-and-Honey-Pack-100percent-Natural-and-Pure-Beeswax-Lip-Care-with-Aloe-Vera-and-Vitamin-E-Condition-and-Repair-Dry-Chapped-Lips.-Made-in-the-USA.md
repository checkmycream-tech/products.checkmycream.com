<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This chapstick works great for moisture.  I love that it&#x27;s natural.  I&#x27;m an avid Mellaluca user... and this is my new favorite that will replace it.  :-)</li>
    <li> Yumm Yumm Yumm.My lips loved this lip balm.The smell was yumolish.Not to strong, doesnt feel waxy it feels smooth.I enjoyed it, I got it for a really good price</li>
    <li> I love vanilla and honey flavors!!!! This lip balm makes my lips very smooth and not sore anymore.  My lips are always dry and sore but when I started using this lip balm, no more lip sore anymore.  I will recommend this to a friend..</li>
    <li> Great lip balm. Made my lips so soft and the taste was great.</li>
    <li> I could just copy paste my review of peppermint to here, it&#x27;s that great! This variety pack was perfect for my family. As with the peppermint, all the flavors are delicious without leaving any weird chemical taste. The biggest plus for me is the non gunking gloss effect. I can wear this from meal to meal without ever getting that odd clumpy feeling. For me, that&#x27;s everything. It&#x27;s lovely over my lipstick, to add the shiny I like without shimmer. The price was fair for what I received. Something else to be noted (and something very important to me as a consumer), the customer service with the company, is just amazing. They emailed me great information with every product. I&#x27;ve put this product on my &amp;#34;refill&amp;#34; wishlist so I can order again.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LITTLE KIT, THE VANILLA BEAN TASTE SO GOOD! shipped promptly!! this review is based solely on my opinion after using the product, would recommend to a friend &amp; very glad I ordered</li>
    <li> Fantastic again, I always buy a thousand lip balms and they never seem to make a difference and the ingredients are the best part! Love them</li>
    <li> Nice packaging.  Item seems to moisturize and doesn&#x27;t leave my lips sticky.  The scent isn&#x27;t over powering.  A slight taste to the lip balm but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> This is top quality lip balm, very faint taste of vanilla which is just what I was looking for in a lip balm. What is also imperative with this is that in a home oxygen setting, we cannot use petroleum base lip protectants as there is a fire risk and this is GOOD TO GO with anyone on O2. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  Love the smell, taste, feel &amp; ease of use. Love that&#x27;s its all natural - something you can tell in the quality with first use. My only issue was that I found myself applying it more often than I normally would - could be that I just loved the natural sugar taste ;)</li>
    <li> The only thing that I&#x27;ve found to actually work for me up until this point has been Chap stick brand lip balm.  I have used lip balm religiously for probably at least 8 years now.  I have to admit that I am really impressed with this lip balm.  It seems to keep my lips very moist and I love the flavor.  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> This is some good stuff.  Being a guy, yet one who is prone to dry cracked lips, I look for lip balms that are effective but not frilly.  These lip balms are nice because they work well and have a pleasant subtle fragrance, that doesn&#x27;t have the smell of &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; lip balms either.</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm. Very thick and creamy. It is important to me that it&#x27;s made of natural ingredients and tastes good. Who knows what other lip balms have but this one is non-GMO! My chapped lips did not sting and felt immediate relief from the product. Really surprises me how fast Amazon ships stuff now. I got it in a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s made in the USofA! I say buy it!</li>
    <li> Let me say first off, I ADORE BBE.  All of their products are wonderful.  So, I tried the new Vanilla Bean and Honey.  I will say that the Vanilla is my favorite, but both are wonderful.  Their taste is just enough to be noticeable but not overly flavored.  The balm is super hydrating without being sloppy.  I liked them so much I will be ordering them again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, BBE!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the honey one but the other 3 smelled good!  It left my lips nice and soft and went on smoothly</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm! This is my second time buying from this company and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The honey and vanilla bean are so luxuriously smooth and taste/smell divine. I feel like my lips absorb all the rich goodness. My husband actually has to stop me from continuously applying it in the O motion - does anyone else do this? It feels great. You definitely get the bang for your buck, 4 lip balms in one (HELLO!!). Just buy it. Your lips will thank you for it! You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> I love theser lip balms. They help with my lips getting chapped and they seem to work immediately. I wear this everyday now</li>
    <li> It kept my lips hydrated for a while</li>
    <li> Awesome lip balm. All natural and moisturizes better than any other. No chemicals or chemical taste. I will buy more lip balm from this company.</li>
    <li> This lipbalm is so smooth! Both the vanilla bean and honey have such a rich smell!  I definitely recommend buying this!</li>
    <li> Much smoother than the original peppermint and I like it better - though the coating is heavier.  The peppermint and 4 flavored pack is lighter with more of a coconut oil slickness and a pleasant sweetness (although a little distracting). I didn&#x27;t like that peppermint and flavored sometimes had rough bits in it.  So its personal preference.  My friend and husband prefer the lighter sweeter ones and I like the smoother subtle ones.  The honey flavor turns my stomach a little, but the vanilla bean is nice.  The original plain (no flavor) is also nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love these products!  I have purchased 2 sets of the variety pack.  These are their new flavors and they are great.  My husband loves them as well and he doesn&#x27;t always like flavored items.  The products are all natural, and really work great!!</li>
    <li> My new favorite!!! I am so tried of using lip balm that dries out within 10 minutes. This made my lips feel soft and smooth for hours.  The scents are subtle and yummy!</li>
    <li> Great lip balms, all natural, great scent and flavors. Will definitely order more in the future.</li>
    <li> My lips thank you for this product! Love the feel and flavors available. I especially love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and pure!</li>
    <li> Oh my I absolutely love these balms. I tried the unflavored plain ones first and loved those and then got these and the flavor and scent is so pleasant.  The balm itself is very hydrating without giving your lips the feeling of being smothered. I&#x27;ll buy these again!</li>
    <li> The best lip Balm I have ever used my lips are so smooth !!</li>
    <li> I received my packaged very quickly!  These are the smoothest on my lips and it stays on for quite a while. My daughter and husband even snatched one up for themselves. Will definitely order again!!</li>
    <li> Loved this lip balm. I&#x27;m a diabetic and always seem to have chapped lips and dry skin. Made lips very soft and helped with chapped lips. This product worked for hours. I preferred the vanilla lip balm the best.</li>
    <li> I love how the  Organic Vanilla Bean and Honey leaves my lips feeling so hydrated . My lips get chapped and by using the Organic  Vanilla and Honey Lip Balm they feel refreshed again .</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm!!! It makes my lips feel so smooth plus it taste really good to!!!!</li>
    <li> The honey one goes on a little smoother than the vanilla one, but all in all these are really nice quality lip balms.</li>
    <li> what great lip balm.. love it! ith the 4 pack i was able to share one with my son and keep one in my purse and one in my makeup bag at home. my lips arent chapped anymore. tastes and smells great too!! will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> I really like these lip balms!  I hate the feeling of cracked skin on my lips and I have been on a quest for a great lip balm that does what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  The balm is not waxy feeling and goes on very silky.  I use it often during the day and always upon waking and before sleeping.  It really has helped my lips to feel smooth.  There is no strong fake taste in either the vanilla bean or honey lip balm.  I recommend it very highly!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever been so extremely pleased with a product that I felt the need to write a review. I have dozens of lip products that I&#x27;ve used a few times before tossing them in the &amp;#34;useless chap stick&amp;#34; drawer, so I know all about lip products and let me tell you, this lip balm truly is outstanding.   I have chronically chapped lips and I just got so tired of all the &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34; type products that would leave a waxy or greasy film on my lips without ever doing anything to address the underlying problem of horrible, dry, cracked, chapped lips. Quite a few of the chap sticks I&#x27;ve tried in the past not only didn&#x27;t help, but actually seemed to make things worse. This lip balm is different; it soothes my lips immediately upon application but it also treats and moisturizes them, reducing the unpleasant symptoms of the chapped lips I&#x27;ve lived with for so long. I&#x27;ve been using this lip balm for several weeks now, and at this point my lips are in better condition than I can ever remember them being. I continue to use it daily for maintenance and simply because I enjoy the scent and feel of it. I love how long lasting it is, too; when I apply it before going to bed, I can still feel it on my lips when I get up in the morning.   I have this Honey and Vanilla set as well as the Peppermint set (which is also wonderful, and has a slightly heavier texture than the Honey and Vanilla varieties), and have been so impressed that I&#x27;ve given away several tubes to friends who have shared my chapped-lip-blues. I&#x27;ve given away enough tubes that even though I&#x27;ve purchased two separate 4-packs in the last month or so, I&#x27;ll need to order more sometime soon since I don&#x27;t ever want to be without this lip balm. If you&#x27;re searching for an effective, long lasting, healing lip product with a smooth texture, easy glide, pleasant scent and taste, then look no further- this is it.  Thank you, Beauty by Earth, for making such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> This product is a &amp;#34;Class Act&amp;#34;. I love love love the different flavors and it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lip balm! Not only do they smell heavenly, they feel heavenly, very light and smooth on your lips. I actually got this package so I could share with my three year old daughter who loves to put stuff on her lips and I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t full of chemicals. They also came in a cute little box which even included a card for 20% off my next purchase! Yes please!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Vanilla bean is her favorite and she also really likes the honey one. There are so many flavors now, with these and the other flavors they have, it never gets boring like other regular chapstick. And it&#x27;s not like kids flavored stuff, it actually really works and is super soft and silky and lasts.</li>
    <li> I feel like it was just regular chapstick, nothing too special.  But it did work, I just thought it was going to be something more</li>
    <li> Love it! Can&#x27;t be without it!!!! And the smell is divine!</li>
    <li> I love this lip balm.  It is the best I have used and heals my chapped lips quickly and leaves them soft.</li>
    <li> This is some smooth chap stick, I live it. The honey flavor is so yummy.</li>
    <li> I love this one! This is my favorite flavor from this company so far. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent lip balm and all natural ingredients with absolutely wonderful flavors!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I bought these for myself and when my wife saw me open the package she even stole one from me. I almost went with peppermint but was glad I got these, the vanilla was a good choice. Maybe I&#x27;ll try peppermint in the future anyway.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product! Got it for a great price to review and I&#x27;m very happy! love it! Each one smells awesome especially the honey!  and my husband loves them too! Loved the packaging  and will want stuff from them again! It reminded me of Burt&#x27;s bees! If you&#x27;re looking for some great lip balm that smells awesome then get this! would make a great gift too!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few days now.  I am very pleased with how they have softened my lips and taken away the cracking on my upper lip.  There is a nice, high quality feel to this product.  I will be purchasing additional items once mine run out.</li>
    <li> As a lip balm addict, I have tried hundreds of different types over the years. (I literally have at least 2 lip products on my person at all times.) These are some of the best I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, no funny taste, lightly scented/flavored, and leave my lips looking and feeling fantastic!</li>
    <li> i have bought several of Beauty by Earths lip balm. I constantly use it. and i constantly lose it. hahaha. when i saw this new flavor. i didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;This is my new go to l ip balm. Tastes great, but not too over powering. does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I love all the Beauty by Earth lip balms! The peppermint is my favorite and my daughter prefers the vanilla bean. My son loves the unscented. It is a good quality product. I live in a dry state and can appreciate a good lip balm.</li>
    <li> Great lip balm.. Vanilla and Honey are both excellent.  light scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm!!!</li>
    <li> I love this balm. It is the best. I live in Wisconsin and always have chapped lips, not no more now that I bought this.</li>
    <li> Love that I can pronounce the ingredients in these lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;100% Natural&lt;br /&gt;just the right amount of sweetness.  The flavor is so right.  The texture is very nice.  Glides on wonderfully,  not too thick to where it&#x27;s cakey, not too thin so it needs to be re applied every 30 minutes.  It&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;No coloring/dyes, so men and children can use them too. No excessive shine.  Very natural looking&lt;br /&gt;My kids asked to try them,  their eyes lit up and they said yum.  I love that they like these but I&#x27;m not sharing,  these babies are just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on my purchase of these balms,  but I will be buying again,  even without the discount.</li>
    <li> These lips balms work very well. They don&#x27;t leave your lips feeling cakey or greasy, just smooth and hydrated. The flavor is very good as well.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm out there as far as I&#x27;m concerned , it is 100% natural and pure beeswax lip care with aloe vera &amp; vitamin E to condition and to repair dry chapped lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These are amazing I will never need to find another lip balm again . I have tried so many different ones expensive and low cost none of them compare to these . They leave your lips soft and smooth , look no further for a great lip balm here it is ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this product , happy happy lips.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lip balm!  And so do my kids!!!  They keep stealing it from me - I&#x27;m so glad it comes 4 to a pack!  It&#x27;s just the right texture and the flavors are wonderful!  Thank you for making another great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting these, when I got the code to get them so much cheaper I was ecstatic!  They are magnificent. Go on smooth&lt;br /&gt; and smell amazing!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Leaves my lips smooth n not waxy like the other big brands. Lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to apply all the time. They also smell so delicious!! Keep making these great irems.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these! My lips were so chapped and this made them really moist. Always like lip gloss better until I tried these!</li>
    <li> I purchased a four pack-two honey and two vanilla and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I really loved it. My lips are super soft. I would definately reccomend this product! The hubby even likes it because it doesnt seem to rub off in him when we kiss. Not greasy, really perfect!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even say how much I love this stuff. I&#x27;m very picky about lip balm. I want something that is natural without a lot of chemicals in it and without artificial color and flavors.  I&#x27;ve found a new favorite product, my only problem is deciding whether I like the Vanilla Bean or the Honey best.  I just can&#x27;t decide!</li>
    <li> They look great and make my lips hidrate.  I would love recommend them my family and friends. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence with this lip balm. I previously purchased the peppermint kind and it did not irritate my lips, but it was not very creamy and kind of difficult to put on. Also, I am not a big fan or peppermint, even though everyone seems to use it in their lip balm. Peppermint burns my lips, especially when they are chapped! I bought this particular kind- vanilla and honey- specifically because there was no peppermint and was hoping they would be creamier and easier to glide on- and they were. My lips seemed to be happy for a while and then, a few days later, they started feeling irritated. I was using the vanilla, so I decided to switch to the honey. Okay for a few days, and then the irritation started again. I could not get over it and tried all kinds of things to try and heal them to no avail. I finally found Smith&#x27;s Rosebud Salve and it healed my lips. I wanted to like this version of Beauty by Earth Lip Care in the vanilla and honey, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Everyone&#x27;s different, though! It may work for you!</li>
    <li> Smell good and taste that way too but nothing special.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it has kept a leasion on my bottom lip from scabbing.  Heretofore when it has scabbed I have bitten it off and the cycle continued.</li>
    <li> Buying cosmetics and the like from Amazon can be risky, especially in the heat of summer. This chap stick was pleasant and effective, but it did melt in shipping and was a bit messy when opened. The honey is subtle and the vanilla isn&#x27;t too strong, at least not on another person&#x27;s lips.</li>
    <li> I love the vanilla one.  I have been sick so my lips are pretty chapped,  but thanks to this lip balm,  they are softer and less painful</li>
    <li> I love earth lib balm my lips stay dry all the time and this chapstick keeps them moisture and makes my lips feel soft</li>
    <li> Feels great on, just dont care for the flavors but my lips are soft</li>
    <li> Great products and great customer relations. I&#x27;ve received several promo offers and discounts and have been SOOOOO happy with the lip balms we&#x27;ve purchased. Great company with a personal feel. I love smelling the Vanilla when my wife uses it (i use the fruity type stuff), and we have both been very pleased with the quality of everything we&#x27;ve purchased thus far (we&#x27;ve had 20 lip balms and a facial mask in the last 6 months)</li>
    <li> These lip balms are excellent! I&#x27;m not a fan of today&#x27;s lip balms, chapsticks, etc. Too many unnecessary ingredients. This one is very simple and smells excellent. It goes on very smoothly and lasts quite a while before I need any touch up. My lips feel happy and hydrated, though I don&#x27;t live in an area with too cold weather it was good for my occasional dry lips.</li>
    <li> I just recently switched to all natural products and this is one of my favorites so far. I used to use blistex medex over night, so I was hoping this would be able to stand in it&#x27;s place. Not quite as long lasting, but I love it for daily use.  I also love the ingredients! Will definitely stock up again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love the subtle scents..they smell amazing. I was excited to have a product like this because I am CONSTANTLY putting on lip balm..I am cursed with horribly dry lips and this seemed like it would be perfect. Shortly after I started using this product (pretty sure it was the vanilla scent), I started getting a rash at the corners of my mouth and a little on the side. I don&#x27;t know if these are hypoallergenic, if i am irritated by something in the ingredients, or it was just some random rash but I stopped using it anyway. Still not sure if it was caused by the lip balm but I&#x27;ll probably find out the day I absentmindedly apply this stuff again. Other than that, and the fact that I felt like i had to re-apply quite a few times a day, it isn&#x27;t a bad product. I do really like the way it smells and hope it isn&#x27;t what caused the rash because I&#x27;d like to maybe get the other flavors/scents one day.</li>
    <li> Love the lip balm! My lips have been very dry lately and this seems to be helping. Great delivery &amp; Price!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy Lip Balm elsewhere until you try this! It&#x27;s the BEST! Keeps your lip moist all day! Love it!</li>
    <li> These are truly wonderful. Goes on super smooth and leaves lips soft. Smells great &amp; uses natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR PROVIDING AN HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> I have to say I am addicted to the Beauty by Earth products. Specifically this lip balm! I&#x27;m a lip balm &amp;#34;junky&amp;#34;. I will up to $30 on lip balm if it works. This is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever personally used. It&#x27;s so good that I had to get this little gift set for my sister as she loves lip balm as well. I use this stuff every day and my lips are no longer dry! This is amazing though because I always had a problem with my lips pealing and this is now totally gone. Thank you for producing such a great product!</li>
    <li> Feels really good.  Tastes likes honey.  I tossed my other chapstick.</li>
    <li> I have been using my first tube of lip balm from this set and I absolutely love it!! I especially love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural using superb ingredients such as beeswax and coconut oil just to name a couple. It smells great and feels great as it really sinks into the lips and doesn&#x27;t just &amp;#34;sit on top&amp;#34; of them like the &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34; cheap low-quality balms out there do. I definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I like this lip product, but it&#x27;s not the best. It does not stay on long at all.  I like thick lip balm, and this is not thick.</li>
    <li> these lip balms smell wonderful and make my lips moisturized all day long.</li>
    <li> Arrived ahead of schedule which was a great plus. Not really a fan of lip balms, but this product sure changed my mind. It&#x27;s unflavored, but it&#x27;s a great product to use for every day especially since I do get my lips chapped every once in an while. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> My lips are chronically and painfully chapped.  I&#x27;ve tried so many types of remedies, from expensive balms to homemade scrubs and lip treatments, to even prescription based remedies from my dermatologist.  After years of trying different therapies I found a homemade mixture of shea, mango, and coconut butter to manage my dry lips.  Then I found Beauty By Earth&#x27;s lip balms.  I figured I would give it a try as a backup and was amazed at the instant transformation of my lips.  I went from managing my dry lips to loving my new soft and moisturized lips.  Literally within a day of starting to use the Lip Balm my lips no longer had any sort of residual chapped pain. Within a few days the peeling and flaking had stopped.  Now my lips are soft, smooth, and they feel wonderful.  Prior to using Beauty By Earth&#x27;s lip balms my lips would crack and bleed.  My lips have not bled once since I started using these balms!  I also have highly sensitive skin.  These balms do not cause any irritation whatsoever.  I absolutely love these balms.  The first set I bought was the Exotic Flavors combination pack.  This combination pack has the same wonderful soothing and healing properties of the Exotic Flavors.  My favorite flavor is Vanilla so I was thrilled to see a Vanilla and Honey combo set come out.  The Vanilla flavor is a lovely light scent and flavor.  It has a hint of sweetness without being overwhelming.  The texture feels just a touch lighter than the Exotic Flavors texture.  The Honey flavor also has a slight sweetness.  The honey flavor is very subtle.  The balm goes on smoothly and instantly makes the lips feel soothed and protected.  It&#x27;s also a great base for lipsticks and doesn&#x27;t have any negative impact on the color applying evenly.  Bonus!  If you have dry lips and want a quality lip balm that will heal your lips and not just temporarily mask the dryness, this is the balm for you.</li>
    <li> Smells yummy and super moist!</li>
    <li> Some of the best lip balm I&#x27;ve tried.  I like to purchase the scented varieties for myself and the unscented for my husband.  FYI, the scents are pleasant, not artificial or overpowering like the cheaper brands.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lip balm! The vanilla is delicious in smell and taste and I love the honey. It&#x27;s not cakey or waxy and it soaks right in and moisturizers. Natural ingredients!</li>
    <li> Um, yes please. In love! Especially happy that this lip balm is so natural with no harsh chemicals or nastiness in it. Just pure vanilla bliss.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm I have ever found. I get slits on the side of my mouth and nothing seems to help, but this lip balm helps the slits and heals my lips quickly. I keep them all over my house and at work. I use the product at least three times a day. I really enjoy using it before I got to bed.</li>
    <li> It keeps your lip very moist and lasts long.  I&#x27;ve never heard the product&#x27;s company before so I am very very surprised how great this lip balm works!  I want a lot of people to try this thing!</li>
    <li> I received my order of Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Vanilla Bean and Honey Lip Balms just in the nick of time!&lt;br /&gt;I have been suffering from a cold and stuffy nose, which caused me to breath through my mouth when sleeping. This left me with dry and slightly cracked lips when I woke up the first day. By the 4th day of being sick, my lips were in terrible condition.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to see the UPS truck pull up to my front door and hopeful that Beauty By Earth&#x27;s Lip Balm would offer some relief and I was not disappointed in the least.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Vanilla Bean Lip Balm first and from the moment I applied it, my lips felt moister.&lt;br /&gt;The all natural ingredients of Beeswax, Coconut Oil, Castor Seed Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil, Stevia, Lanolin, Natural Flavor (Vanillin &amp; Brown Sugar), Aloe Vera, Vitamin E (non-GMO), Rosemary Leaf Extract began to sooth my dry cracked lips instantly!&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant scent and applied easily and smoothly without caking or leaving my lips feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as I have found with other lip balm products.&lt;br /&gt;It has only taken 2 days to see a marked difference in the condition of my lips.&lt;br /&gt;The Honey was equally as effective and I love the subtle scent and flavor.&lt;br /&gt;These Beauty by Earth&#x27;s Vanilla Bean and Honey Lip Balms are my new favorite lip balms and I look forward to trying the other flavors this company offers.&lt;br /&gt;Beauty By Earth shipped quickly and offered excellent order follow up. I love that they use recyclable packaging and do not test their products on animals.&lt;br /&gt;A+++ Recommendation!</li>
    <li> Received these yesterday. Omg they make my lips feel nice and smooth. And they smell good too.</li>
    <li> These are great. They make my lips so smooth. I also instantly noticed the amazing smell. I&#x27;ll get these again because they are just the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The best lip balm. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it, you won&#x27;t use anything else&#x27;s after you try this brand, I like all the flavors. I even give it as gifts!</li>
    <li> Great great great great lip balm!</li>
    <li> I will rate these 4-stars.  They do feel nice on the lips and seem to last a while between applications.  That said, I&#x27;m not seeing the fantastic improvement in my lips that all the glowing reviews would lead one to expect.  I don&#x27;t see a lasting improvement and need to frequently reapply.  My lips are still a bit rough and tend to feel chapped without application of the lip balm after using for about three weeks.  I do like that the honey and vanilla are not overwhelming.  I usually detest flavored/scented lip products after a short time, but these are very nice.</li>
    <li> Really nice lip balm. Very moisturizing. Smells good. Was the most helpful thing when I had very dry lips.</li>
    <li> Some of the best chapstick I&#x27;ve used. Very lightly scented and just a hint of honey. Tastes amazing and doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out.</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas and my lips are always cracking to a point that they sometimes bleed. I have tried everything from high end lip balms and expensive lip scrubs. I love these lip balms and will continue to use them and purchase more when I run out. Thank you Beauty by Earth!</li>
    <li> First and for most, aside from providing all natural organic products, beauty by earth&#x27;s costumer service is superb. They take personal interest in the customers feedback and try their best to meet their needs. This is extremely important to me, a company may provide an amazing product but if they have poor customer service I will not continue to use their services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, beauty by earth&#x27;s products are great ! I own all of their lip balms and their hydrating face mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lip balms are sooo good. The texture and consistency of them are great. They are smooth and have just the right amount of &amp;#34;thinkness&amp;#34;  for them to feel moisturizing and hydrating but thin enough that they do not look or feel waxy.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite one in this set is the vanilla bean. It&#x27;s scent and taste is very subtle and not overpowering, which I love. The honey one has a bit more scented and favored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;d say if you decide to try this balm, assuming you usually like this types of flavors, I think you&#x27;d be pleased.</li>
    <li> I am a chapstick/lip balm addict. I easily have 30+ in my house at any given moment. Most chapsticks are greasy or sticky. My boyfriend hates the feeling also when I kiss him. He will actually let me kiss him when I wear this. I didn&#x27;t taste it, it doesn&#x27;t have a scent that I can tell, do to my sinuses being messed up at the moment. I really love this and will definitely being purshasing this again in the future. I love the honey. That&#x27;s the one currently in my purse.</li>
    <li> I like it. Just realized it is longer lasting than other lip balms, just three times a day. This surprises as it applies lightly, not heavy layered. Now buying my second pack. Was long lasting.   Others require ever hour to two hours.</li>
    <li> Well I really wanted to try these,but my husband and daughter took them!!! And they asked me if I was gonna order more,so there you go!,</li>
    <li> I bought this for me now it belongs to my husband he took it.  Lol yes feels very good on your lip taste good also,  first it was can I try some now where did it go.  I will buying more we both love it.</li>
    <li> Very effective product. I&#x27;ve only had to apply it once or twice a day to keep my lips soft.</li>
    <li> Made my lips feel soft and smooth would recommend it</li>
    <li> I purchased the lip balm because I have some very matte lip stains and they dry my lips out.  I used the Honey lip balm under my very matte lipstick and let me tell you, it kept my lips very moist.</li>
    <li> Smooth, wonderful fragrance. I love that it&#x27;s natural without chemicals. I&#x27;ll be getting this again.</li>
    <li> This product was received exclusively for reviewing purposes. The evaluation of the product had been conducted independently with no external influences from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product set is presented in a thin cardboard box and contains 4 lip balms; 2 vanilla bean lip balms and 2 honey lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each balm tube is 0.15oz in size and this makes them average sized. They are made of 100% natural ingredients with no petroleum, parabens, mineral oil, soy or any other undesirable chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they are different in nature the application is the same as your standard lip balm; apply  as needed to dry or chapped lips or as a base for lip colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use I found that the roll out mechanism worked well and the scent and taste of the vanilla bean and honey were very pleasant and worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I had never thought about using natural lip balms before I&#x27;m certainly glad that I&#x27;ve been introduced to them as I will be putting less undesirable chemicals in my body whilst achieving the same benefits of normal lip balms.</li>
    <li> I already knew I loved the lip balms from Beauty by Earth, so I was very excited to see that they had new flavors!! I tried them and was not disappointed. The vanilla bean is my new favorite. It glides on so smoothly and keeps my lips so amazingly soft! I have a LOT of different lip products, and none of them can compare to this. Not only that, their products are all natural, so I know I&#x27;m not putting potentially dangerous chemicals all over my face when I use them!!</li>
    <li> These lip balms are wonderful! I especially love the vanilla bean. It is nice that they are sold in a four pack so I can have multiple lip balms around the house and in my car. I also love that they are organic and I can use them on my children without worry. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite lip balm, goes on so silky and smooth, does a wonderful job of moisturizing my lips and smells wonderful! I will be repurchasing. Thanks, Beauty by Earth! :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used lip balms by this company in the past, and this also is a wonderful product.  The balm goes on smoothly.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or heavy afterwards.  I like the fact that they use all natural products and the hint of vanilla and honey is an added bonus.  I would recommend those who haven&#x27;t tried Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balms to give this a try.</li>
    <li> Amazing lip balm! Very basic ingredients and no added chemicals! Love it and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Enjoy the new Vanilla Bean taste and love that there is an unscented lip balm for times you are going to eat. As I&#x27;ve said before on the other flavors, this is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used and will not go back to the other busy bee chapstick or any other ever again! It is emollient - softens my lips and keeps them supple without any waxy feel .As my daughter said, whom I gifted some at Christmas and again when these came out - she loves it so much, she has one of these Beauty by Earth lip balms stashed in every conceivable place - her purse, her car, her book bag for school, her bed room nightable, etc etc. Like me, she cant get by without it anymore. GREAT! stuff - HIGHLY Recommend!</li>
    <li> This stuff is excellent for the lips. From the first swipe I felt instant relief from the chapped winter lips. I use it a few times a day and love it!</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and has a very pleasant smell and light texture.  Has been a great source of moisture to my dry and cracked lips.  I would definitely purchase this product and encourage others to get it.  Excellent</li>
    <li> I like the way it felt and keep my lips moist throughout the day great product.I love these Lip Balms use it all the time and these are the best ever scent perfect and they are all natural a great choice. I Am glad i tried them will be ordering more thank you for the great product..</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Crazy smooth and is as good as other harsher type chapsticks one might use on REALLY chapped lipped like I get, but this one&#x27;s just so naturally amazing it&#x27;s set above the rest.</li>
    <li> These lip balms are great. They moisten and comfort your lips very well. You can tell from the feel of them that they are made with all natural ingredients. They&#x27;re great quality.</li>
    <li> Great flavors and my lips stay soft.</li>
    <li> Their products are so good...lip balm, no exception. Exfoliate any dead skin first...using simple sugar/olive pik scrub.</li>
    <li> The Vanilla Bean smells soo good and it&#x27;s so moisturizing. It&#x27;s my favorite and I have the peppermint ones from this company too but I still prefer this one. I&#x27;m tempted to eat my own lips because it really does smell like vanilla. It&#x27;s a great deal for the price. I used to use EOS which is still good but I definitely prefer Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balms.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great packaging, 4 included. Organic. Even my 8 year old likes it and she is really picky. It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t taste bad. I am honored to have been one of the first to give it a try! Thanks!</li>
    <li> This lip balm works as well as it smells..... and it smells delicious!  Our son struggles with chapped lips during the winter months in Ohio and since he started using this, his lips are smooth and perfect.  He says it doesn&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;a girl&amp;#34; lipstick.  This for a 12 year old boy!</li>
    <li> After hearing good things about this Chapstick I decided to give it a try. Went on really smooth but only lasted about an hour before I had to keep re-applying.</li>
    <li> I love the taste and smell. It&#x27;s not too greasy, great moisturizer. Have to apply liberally but it make the lips soft and supple. I would suggest this product as it does the job. A++ from me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!! Super soft!! Defiantly recommending to family and friends!</li>
    <li> I recently recieved my Earth Beauty Lip Balm  and I can tell you We love it my grandsons lips chap all the time and it works wonders thank you for the opportunity to try this we ate pleased.</li>
    <li> i am absolutely in love with the beauty by earth skin care line. It makes my lips feel smooth and I love that it&#x27;s all natural :-)</li>
    <li> I tried these at a promotional price and I love them.  The scent is not overwhelming and the product is great.  I&#x27;ve tried almost every different scent by this company and they are all very pleasant and do the job of healing chapped lips as well as keeping them moist after healing so they don&#x27;t become chapped again.</li>
    <li> Awesome product as expected, love it</li>
    <li> Love this. The flavor, the texture the smell, all I can say is mmmmmmmmmmm. Its wonderful I will be buying more in the future I love that its nature . I dont think there is anything I dont like about it. I keep some with me at all times.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it! Especially the vanilla bean flavor. I like that its natural and lasts longer and its not loose or liquidy like carmex can be once it hits the lips its perfect! And apparently my 1year old loves to eat it LOL</li>
    <li> I am seriously blown away by this stuff! I have tried numerous lip balms, everything from your regular chapstick, to the super high end &amp; expensive lip balms, to the pricey &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ones you find at the health food stores. None of them worked, and all of them dried out my lips even more. This is the first lip balm that I have used that actually makes my lips soft and moisturized. i am beyond in love with this stuff! Please, whatever you guys do, NEVER change the ingredients in this lip balm!! That old saying &amp;#34;if it&#x27;s not broke don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; completely reins true with this product. I am eagerly looking forward to trying some of the other products made by this company. If they are anything like this lip balm then I will be super satisfied!</li>
    <li> These are really nice lip balms! I wanted them originally because of the vanilla and honey flavors but I need natural lip products, which is really important especially because you ingest a lot of lip products. These did not disappoint! What I love is that they leave your lips moisturized for HOURS without re-applying. I really only have to use it morning and night after brushing my teeth, and maybe once in between, whereas with Burts Bees, EOS, etc, I would reapply every hour. And they taste so good! I almost want to lick them off my lips when I&#x27;m using them...I highly encourage you to convert to natural lip products!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I love the simple packaging (often a real pet peeve of mine to have companies so wasteful).  I love the product, the ingredients, the way it feels and smells (and tastes).  I&#x27;m hooked and need to order more.  Good job!</li>
    <li> There is nothing particularly special about this lip balm in terms of effectiveness. It moisturizes just as well as any drug store brand. The vanilla scent is good, but the honey scent gives me a bit of a headache.</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm! The flavors are awesome, especially the honey. Can&#x27;t wait to use this all up and try the other different kinds by this company. As I am only trying to use natural lip balm now I will continue to purchase these!</li>
    <li> These lip balms smell absolutely delicious! Did you know most normal chap sticks actually dry your lips?  So you have to keep re-applying to have the illusion of moisture.  Not these!  They really give you luscious feeling on your lips and it feels like they are giving them real, permanent benefits.  I&#x27;m addicted to them :)</li>
    <li> These are my favorite Chapsticks ever! I&#x27;m a self proclaimed Chapstick junkie if that tells you anything. I have them everywhere in my house and bags/purses. They are a must when you live in the desert. My only request it&#x27;s for you guys to make one with SPF! That would be AMAZING, as would a tinted chapstick. I like the Burt&#x27;s bees tinted lip balm, but the moisture isn&#x27;t a good as these. Also, I find it very difficult to find a Chapstick with SPF that I love enough to buy again. These are my favorite and would like more options. Expand offerings please :-)  Oh! I tried the other variety pack worth fruity flavored and they are a bit sweet and more strongly scented than this pack. This pack is holy grail of lip balm for me.</li>
    <li> So.....  I have a lip balm/chap stick addiction.  I have about 16 lip balms from this brand and a variety of their flavors.  Several not included in my picture. and I did share 1 tube with my mother who LOVES it as well.  After trying these I ended up tossing my other Blistex and Burts Bees to the trash.  Great flavors, long lasting, all natural, and smooth.  I always hated how Burts would come off in chunks on my lips sometimes and the texture and taste was very unappealing to me.  I went on a hunt one day for an alternative and am VERY glad I found Beauty By Earth.  Beauty by Earths lip balm is the only brand over the years that I have actually used the entire tube of.  PLUS I am happy they have alternatives to the normal mint balms you run into normally.  As long as the price stays on point I will be a forever buyer.</li>
    <li> Great product, wonderfully natural ingredients and good flavors. Feels really nice on my lips and my kids love it as well!</li>
    <li> Lightening fast shipping! Same great product as their original, just a new flavor.  Personally my favorite is still the peppermint, but the vanilla bean is good for a change . This companys lip balm is by far the best all natural lip balm out there. Much better than burts bees. Now if the just made tinted lip balms....</li>
    <li> These Lip balm&#x27;s have become life savers for me!!! My girls and I love how smooth and Moisturizing they are... Their natural and 100% better than other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands I have tried--- I&#x27;m hooked on Beauty by Earth!!</li>
    <li> What can I say??? I am OBSESSED!! These lip balms from Beauty By Earth are incredible. They leave my normally dry and crack lips feeling hydrated and smooth. Because of this, I have other people obsessed too. So now everyone I know is throwing out their other chap sticks and using this! Another plus side to this product is that is smells AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> These lip balms are awesome. My lips feel soft and hydrated soon after applying it on. The flavors are great too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the ingredients that are used (natural), and more importantly the ingredients that are NOT used (found in some comparable lip balms). However, I took away one star since they used Stevia. I am personally not a fan of Stevia, and could do without it in this lip balm (I guess they added it in to make it &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34; sweet).</li>
    <li> The flavors are not overly sweet and are really pleasant. The product goes on very smooth and it lasts a lot longer than other lip balms. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Saw the reviews on Amazon which were outstanding for this lip balm so I figured that I would try it.  I was not disappointed at all.  Great product!  I have to say this is the best lip balm I have ever used.  The Vanilla reminds me sitting near a lake in the country with a good book.  I have not tried the honey one yet.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> Best lip balm I have ever used!!</li>
    <li> This lip balm, along with the unscented version, is really great.  The texture is smooth and my lips don&#x27;t feel greasy or sticky when I use it.  I love the way they smell and feel on my lips.  Highly, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Love this lip balm. Goes on very smooth and it is long lasting. Also smells awsome. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this chapstick.  My lips have been so dry.  Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this set of chapsticks. The scents were wonderful and I try to buy natural products as much as I can so that is also a big plus. It didn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy and left my lips feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Really helps to moisturize my very dry lips and not aggravate my allergies. Nice texture and smell no nasty taste when lick lips. Not overpowering with smell either. Easy to keep up with and enough to shae with family.</li>
    <li> Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balms are fabulous! No other balm keeps my lips as soft and moisturized. Other natural balms often make my lips drier after repeated use, but I don&#x27;t have this problem with Beauty by Earth&#x27;s lip balms.&lt;br /&gt;The new Vanilla Bean &amp; Honey 4-pack is the real deal. I keep bees as a hobby so I&#x27;ve been around enough honey and beeswax to know the difference between true, 100% authentic honey and beeswax versus synthetically-derived \\&quot;honey/beeswax\\&quot; scents and flavors. You can&#x27;t go wrong with any flavor of this lip balm line. In a world of toxic and synthetic beauty products, Beauty by Earth is a welcome relief!</li>
    <li> This is such a good lip balm. Smells great!!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a lot of chapstik but found myself using these more often.  I was given a deal to try this product and was happy to do so as I have purchased some of their other products and love everything they have available.  I especially love anything vanilla and this was right up my alley.  They go on smoothly, are not overpowering and come in a cute little box.  Their customer service is outstanding, so anything you need they are happy to help you with.  I will purchase these most definately in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve was a little nervous to try these since I&#x27;m very picky about my Chapstick, but with extremely chap lips I had to try something else. After trying this my lips were super soft and smooth. I will be switching to this now!</li>
    <li> First and foremost, these are awesome. Both of us are using them - a set of scents for each of us. I started with Honey and she started with the Vanilla Bean one. Both smell absolutely fantastic and go on smooth. The smooth feeling lasts for several hours but my lips didn&#x27;t feel dry after it wore off like many lip balms tend to do. With the weather jumping around, I normally get super chapped lips during this time of year and had them before getting this product in. Now, I&#x27;m not experiencing that issue at all. I got these on discount, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
    <li> After trying their unflavored lip balm I just knew I needed to try their flavored one. The vanilla bean is amazing and not artificial tasting/smelling. The honey is great also and is slightly sweet which I actually enjoy. Now if you are a rebel like me I put one flavor on top and one on the bottom them mix them together it is awesome and a great combo! Vanilla and honey is a perfect combo! I love that these lip balms are all natural and they keep my lips moist without having to reapply over and over through out the day. I was able to purchase these during a promotion and I love them! I also like that they are sold in 4 packs so I know I&#x27;ll never run out!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works great and goes on easy. Love the flavors!</li>
    <li> Yummy flavors!  Another great product from Beauty by Earth.</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on smooth, no waxy feel. I was out in some blustery wind so my lips were a bit chapped, I could feel instant soothing.  My lips are soft and well moistened.</li>
    <li> I had it for a couple of days and it works very well. Last long time</li>
    <li> I have tried so many other lip balms before and I can honestly say that these are the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  After a windy weekend outside my lips were so dry and cracked.  It was to the point it hurt to open my mouth to eat.  After using the Honey lip balm for 2 days, no more cracked lips.  The flavor is awesome too.  No funky smells at all.  Very nice.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> These are so perfect for my daughter who has very chapped lips this time of year here in rural Maine.  Fits perfect in her jacket pocket.  I like that it is a nice natural product not loaded with a bunch of fillers.</li>
    <li> Works really well! Even my kids love it!</li>
    <li> This lip balm leaves your lips feeling super moist. It goes on smooth and the flavors are great! Keeps my lips feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Okay i received these as a testing product for a review, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM, the vanilla bean smells like candy and i could just eat it up! but the moisterizer in these are fan freaking tastic after appliation they last for quite awhile, thank you for letting me try your wonderful product i will be ordering some more in other flavors</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brand of lip balm. I am extremely picky, not only about the ingredients in my lip balm, but also about flavor and texture. This one checks all the boxes. It is made of 100% natural ingredients that I feel comfortable using on my lips every day. (Plus, I don&#x27;t have to worry about my chapstick-eating toddler getting her hands on it!) It has a very light, pleasant taste, and it feels great when you put it on. It lasts a good amount of time and leaves my lips feeling great, not more chapped after it wears off, like some other brands do. I love getting the 4-pack, because now I have one everywhere--in my purse, my car, at my desk, and in my nightstand! Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I had tried using the bigger brand lip balms to help with my recurring chapped/split lower lip and it really did nothing for me, tried this out due to all the positive reviews and it has worked amazingly well. After only a few days my lip is almost back to normal.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve tried this brand of lip balm you know how well it works, these two new scent/flavors work just as good as the rest. If you haven&#x27;t tried this stuff yet, you really can&#x27;t go wrong when choosing a flavor, they&#x27;re all really good and have the all natural non-chemical ingredients in them. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying it, just do it, you will not be disappointed. You will be hooked, like me lol</li>
    <li> My mom is addicted to these chapsticks. It&#x27;s great having them in every draw, car, purse, etc.</li>
    <li> I had really bad lips.  I spent years chewing on them and (they were nice and big) they actually had scars on them.  I got the product for the repair aspect.  And it did just that.  It&#x27;s been repairing my lips.  My lips haven&#x27;t looked this good since before I started the horrible habit of biting my lips.&lt;br /&gt;As a plus, the ingredients are all natural!!</li>
    <li> Like the Peppermint lip balm, this Beauty by Earth Vanilla Bean &amp; Honey lip balm is wonderful. It is my new favorite. I have been using the Beauty by Earth lip balm all winter and have not had chapped lips once!</li>
    <li> Great flavors but more importantly is that this stuff really is getting me through weather that normally causes chapped and peeling lips,  I wont use anything else!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works great</li>
    <li> Lips stay nice and soft.</li>
    <li> Very smooth on lips and doesn&#x27;t dry them.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m a chapstick addict. Before Beauty by Earth, I always at a Burt&#x27;s Bees in my pocket.  I was hesitant to try another brand, but the flavors of Beauty by Earth were too enticing! Besides perfectly soothing my lips, the Honey and Vanilla Bean chapsticks smell and taste amazing! I will definitely keep using these products!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The vanilla is by far my favorite, the scent is pleasant and leave lips nice and smoothe! The fact that this Chapstick is chemical free makes me feel confident to give to my kids! Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
