    <li> It has been a gift for one of my sisters and she LOVES it and gets compliments from other who are near to her!  When she around me, it trilu smells so good on here!  So when her current perfume ran out, I purchased her another one!</li>
    <li> It is the only eau de toilette I use.  I have been using it for 10 years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift.  They loved it.  I can&#x27;t say much myself.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m afraid that this cologne that I&#x27;ve always loved so much may smell different on me now because I&#x27;ve started menopause. I haven&#x27;t sampled it anywhere else, so I can&#x27;t say for sure that is the reason it smells different. I wouldn&#x27;t discourage anyone from trying it for themselves.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Spicy fragrance.</li>
    <li> very pleased.  Good Shipper.</li>
    <li> I have never smelled this fragrance before my girl friend introduced me to it. I finally was able to purchase her a bottle and am glad I did so. She smells great and is happy as pie! Need I say more. Well, I will recommend this to any woman that would like her man to melt with the wonderful aroma of this fine perfume.</li>
    <li> Bijan By Bijan For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces was an asked for Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> Scent is very personal. Perfumes do not necessarily have the same scent on different people. However I love the light sweet fragrance of Bijan for Women and receive many compliments while wearing it.... so maybe you will like it too!</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. The birthday girl was delighted.</li>
    <li> This is a very subtle fragrance.  At first when you put it on it smells strong, then it goes away when you walk by someone one you leave something pleasant.  I love this fragrance.  It does not go with every woman&#x27;s chemistry.</li>
    <li> She loves bijan and was upset when she couldn&#x27;t get it in any local stores. Nevertheless she was excited about getting 6 months worth of her favorite perfume :)</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Bought this after someone else was wearing it and asked her what it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scents usually bother me but this one is very nice.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product in the local stores and couldn&#x27;t find it.  This has been one of my favorite sents for years so I was very happy to be able to obtain it from you.  Also, your prices are always very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Bijan for years and when I recieved this product, it didnt look exactly as I remembered. The print on the box was flat not raised like on previous boxes I&#x27;ve owned. When I opened and smelled it did not smell at all like Bijan to me, but I worn it anyway. After an hour I smelled it and I couldn&#x27;t smell anything. I dont think this is Bijan at all! I&#x27;m very dissapointed!!! The only good thing is I did receive it very quickly</li>
    <li> Very nice and same as in the store great price</li>
    <li> Good price. Been wearing for years but can&#x27;t find this locally anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Bijan for about 20 years now and just love it.  I have trouble wearing a lot of fragrances as they give me a headache but appreciate Amazon carrying Bijan and at such a reasonable price.  My items are always shipped so quickly.  Love Bijan and Amazon!!</li>
