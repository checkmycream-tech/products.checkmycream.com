      <li>It really looks like I am not wearing anything on my face at all.</li>
      <li>but it is harder to deal with than most of them.</li>
      <li>My favorite everyday foundation.</li>
      <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the natural finish.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this powder, as well as the Fit</li>

<li> It is also difficult to open.</li>
<li> At least an SPF 15 would probably make me give this 5 stars.</li>

    <li> I ordered the 225 but I got the wrong one, I received the 120.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this powder, as well as the Fit Me concealer (and probably the Fit Me foundation), contain talc. I used only the powder and the concealer and they broke my skin out quite a bit.</li>
    <li> Great product... I love it because if you get the right skin tone color, it looks so natural and you look outstanding ! :)</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this powder after a friend of mine told me about it. She had been using it for a while and she said it was very good compared to a revlon and an Almay powder she had previously used. I bought the powder in 120 and it seemed to blend in perfectly on my face. Very slight coverage. It really looks like I am not wearing anything on my face at all. This just makes my complexion tone look a bit more even which is all I really wanted in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this specific line from Maybelline has so many different colors to choose from. The price is great. The compact is very convenient and snaps shut and feels pretty strong and secure. I just wish they would add some SPF to the powder like some other brands do. At least an SPF 15 would probably make me give this 5 stars. I just use a moisturizer with some SPF and then apply this powder over it.</li>
    <li> The powder is powder. The enthusiasm of the other reviewers is odd to me. It is a bit heavy. My major complaint is the design of the compact itself. The mirror is on the underside from where the powder is so you have to keep flipping back and forth to see what you are doing which is very inconvenient. It is also difficult to open. It&#x27;s like the designer was trying to be too hip and created a square compact - which is fine - but it is harder to deal with than most of them. It will keep me from buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Great compact.  My only wish is that it would be nice if the container was thinner.  It&#x27;s a little bulky, but overall the powder is great!</li>
    <li> Love this powder it makes your skin glow and its has a shimmer but not much thats why I liked it. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It is very good and more than expected&lt;br /&gt;as it is very nice and well handled.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good and more than expected&lt;br /&gt;as it is very nice and well handled.</li>
    <li> This powder is perfect! I was expecting more to be in the container but I realized now that a little goes a long way. I have found my perfect shade-315 Golden Honey- and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the natural finish.</li>
    <li> I liked it... I asked for a color too light for me, but I use it to set my concealer.</li>
    <li> Ive never used powder before but I have always heard it helps give you a more flawless look and I have to agree.</li>
    <li> The compact powder is a good product. The color matched well with my skin but the sponge that was provided didn&#x27;t last long. After a week, the sponge started to lose shape and the cotton inside the cloth started to come out. I had to buy a separate sponge after 2 weeks of withstanding it. Overall, the powder itself was good. Was kinda hesitant to buy it coz other reviews said it had glitters. However, the glitters aren&#x27;t too showy. It&#x27;s not even obvious so it was a relief.</li>
    <li> Nice powder at a nice price.  Very soft, fine finish.  The only thing that could possibly improve it would be SPF protection but that&#x27;s hard to find in a powder.</li>
    <li> This powder is amazing for something that can be purchased so cheeply. It feels great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any break-outs. It&#x27;s not as nice as the Clinique powder I had been using, but it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost.</li>

    <li> My favorite drug store powder its not overly matte and gives a very very sutle glow and sets my make up! You must try this amazing powder and great color selection</li>
    <li> This is a nice product but I ordered the wrong color.  I have ivory skin and this made me look like a ghost lol.  Next time I will order a darker color.</li>
    <li> My favorite everyday foundation. Great coverage and good color.</li>
    <li> The color matches perfectly. Coverage lasts the majority of the day, and is easy to carry around should you need to reapply. I don&#x27;t usually reapply though, and have no complaints.</li>
