      <li>and I am good to go.</li>
      <li>this is like a foundation good coverage</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve always used Missa BB Cream and thought it was already really good.</li>
      <li>This is awesome makeup, just the perfect shade, goes on smooth, stays nice, makes your face look bright and fresh.</li>
      <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this stuff to smell as good as it does.</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>It provides great coverage but is lightweight and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>Then when I started to use this, it was just amazing.</li>
      <li>People took notice of how nice my skin looked today, and I even noticed as well.  </li>
      <li>Plus I love that it&#x27;s good for your skin</li>
      <li>It also works nice.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover as well, even though there is more product in the packaging and it has its own unique and pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>this one is the bast!&lt;br /&gt;The color is great for Asian skin and great moisture!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>im medium olive and is very light.</li>
      <li>The color is warm toned and spreads so easily.</li>
      <li>and I feel my skin is a bit better at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>haha!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely ordering another bottle! :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this BB cream, in fact this might just be my favorite one.</li>
      <li>It is what I did and I am able to use it.</li>
      <li>I feel like my skin looks better and better the longer that I use it.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff</li>

      <li>-absolutely LOVE the packaging&lt;</li>
      <li>I love, love, love this</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands and</li>
      <li>This product is awesome totally recommend the seller and the product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have fair skin and it looks nice and natural!!!</li>
      <li>But still a pretty good bb cream :)</li>
      <li>This covers more lightly, but it definitely makes your skin look beautiful!</li>
      <li>I tried three of them while in Korea and this one is hands down the best all around.</li>
      <li>I will not be able to use this in the summer cuz I get tan quick.</li>
      <li>But if you have light freckles and some pigmentation this will do.</li>
      <li>While it is light, it still evens out my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This one was so great I bought about 5 tubes to bring back home.</li>
      <li>a light creamy texture that melts into skin&lt;br /&gt;-feels moisturizing and soothing</li>
      <li>I always go for medium coverage stuff - light coverage to me</li>
      <li>This cream has a great medium coverage, and can build into heavier coverage with a second application.</li>
      <li>Want to love it so much since I love skinfood packaging and their concept a lot.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering more!!</li>
      <li>This is a very good product and looks very natural even on old skin like mine..</li>
      <li>but it is pretty light.  </li>
      <li>#34;Apple scented&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;- gave it 4 stars because the #2 shade is still pretty light.</li>
      <li>This is the first BB cream I have ever used, and I have to say I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
      <li>Looks a little light in color when you first start to apply it, but somehow it evens out and really looks natural and feels light and wonderful!</li>
      <li>Great consistency and coverage, color is easy to blend with natural skin tone and does not have a gray undertone like a lot of other BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Has a very herbal smell, not synthetic/chemical and the cream is light, not oily.</li>
      <li>I plan to try it without primer tomorrow, but so far, I love it.</li>
      <li>and this is juuuust right.</li>
      <li>This stuff is Soooo much better than any of the American BB creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I tried it for the first time today with makeup primer, and it lasted all day.</li>
      <li>I have it in the darker shade (#2 Natural Skin), but it&#x27;s still pretty light.</li>
      <li>Like fresh apple (real Apple mind</li>
      <li>; I pat on powder foundation mid-day for a more matt look but would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 47 and just now starting to worry about laugh lines and fine lines.</li>
      <li>No weird residues, and it leaves my skin super soft.</li>
      <li>It smells so good and last a long time!!!</li>
      <li>it works really well on my face</li>
      <li>haha...</li>
      <li>It feels very moisturizing on my skin</li>
      <li>and it really goes along way.</li>
      <li>If you have darker skin, specficially, African American skin, blend with your own foundation to get the benefits of the BB cream.  </li>
      <li>Smells great, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
      <li>and I have some pigmented skin and am light skinned, Don&#x27;t expect miracles if you need Super Heavy Coverage for Birth marks</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m about NC25 in MAC, Bisque in Laura Mercier (tinted moisturizer), Golden Medium in Bare Escentuals, and L3 in Smashbox, I40 in Shiseido, and Ivory in Hourglass (tinted moisturizer).</li>
      <li>I usually use tigi foundation because I liked the coverage.</li>
      <li>I am a new fan of Skinfood!</li>
      <li>It actually heals my dry skin and keep it nice and not dull.</li>
      <li>I live in SE Texas and it stays on, even in high humidity, without having to re-apply!</li>
      <li>I highly highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>It looks a little heavy and has a tinge of pink, but after a while it blends a lot better and looks more natural.</li>
      <li>In the wrong light, this BB cream looks light, so what I like to do is to add a dab of concealer that is one shade darker than my skintone.</li>
      <li>I picked Natural</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;m 49 years old</li>
      <li>It makes skin look clear and soft.</li>
      <li>Naturally, being in theatre, I had to try all kinds of skin care and makeup products when I couldn&#x27;t find the things I used in America.</li>
      <li>There are mainly young girls doing the DEMO</li>
      <li>It is slightly lighter when you first put it on but really blends well after</li>
      <li>It helps to balance out the extra pink and make it slightly darker so that it balances out even better than just applying the cream alone.</li>
      <li>Although I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell (something of a mushroom peach salad), the product was creamy, thick, moisturizing without being greasy, easily blendable, doesn&#x27;t dry too fast but does dry.  </li>
      <li>For information I&#x27;m Asian, combination dry skin, live in humid area.</li>
      <li>Also,it&#x27;s a third of the cost of Dr. Jart, just a much coverage without being oily like Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox.</li>
      <li>Got a natural beige and it&#x27;s so white for me, oily, shiny yet at the same time too dry on the cheeks.</li>

<li> not much coverage, don&#x27;t like the color much, very small tube and price is not cheaper than other products, I like Missha better</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Makes my face a little lighter  just enough to softly disappear my eye circles .</li>
<li> Like most other BB creams it looks like crap when you first put it on, and this one is no exception.</li>
<li> :) makes me feel less guilty when I slather it on my face</li>
<li> This bb cream in shade 2 blends in with olive or medium dark skin as it has a yellow undertone.</li>
<li> Lastly, just like all other BB creams, tinted moisturizers, and foundations, don&#x27;t forget to apply moisturizer underneath!</li>
<li> is the same as wasting money and heavy coverage</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love this product! It provides great coverage but is lightweight and goes on smooth. The SPF elimates my need for another product that does that. I feel like my skin looks better and better the longer that I use it. I am a new fan of Skinfood!</li>
    <li> Cream applies smoothly to facial skin and does not leave it oily, nor heavy.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this, I&#x27;m 49 years old and I thought no way is just a BB cream gonna give me the coverage that I want, but since summer is coming up I tend to use these a lot. Gosh this is like a foundation good coverage and I have some pigmented skin and am light skinned, Don&#x27;t expect miracles if you need Super Heavy Coverage for Birth marks etc., But if you have light freckles and some pigmentation this will do. Look it up DEMO on UTUBE before  purchasing.. There are mainly young girls doing the DEMO so I had my doubts, but I don&#x27;t anymore, BEST BB Cream out there..</li>
    <li> I went to Korea to teach ESL. Naturally, being in theatre, I had to try all kinds of skin care and makeup products when I couldn&#x27;t find the things I used in America.This one was so great I bought about 5 tubes to bring back home. It is way cheaper there at the Skin Food Stores. I was totally amazed at the difference in my skin in one year and also the fact that with this I stopped wearing makeup foundation all together. I am 56 and people at the skin care counters in America rave about my skin and how it looks....( that is when I go to buy other products ). I tried three of them while in Korea and this one is hands down the best all around.</li>
    <li> This bb cream in shade 2 blends in with olive or medium dark skin as it has a yellow undertone. It makes skin look clear and soft.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this BB cream, in fact this might just be my favorite one. I have it in the darker shade (#2 Natural Skin), but it&#x27;s still pretty light. I have typical yellow-toned Asian skin, but I&#x27;m not that pale. I&#x27;m about NC25 in MAC, Bisque in Laura Mercier (tinted moisturizer), Golden Medium in Bare Escentuals, and L3 in Smashbox, I40 in Shiseido, and Ivory in Hourglass (tinted moisturizer). If you didn&#x27;t notice, I&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of foundations &amp; tinted moisturizers, but I still find myself coming back to BB creams because of their multipurpose quality. I always go for medium coverage stuff - light coverage to me is the same as wasting money and heavy coverage is not for every occasion. This cream has a great medium coverage, and can build into heavier coverage with a second application. Like most other BB creams it looks like crap when you first put it on, and this one is no exception. It looks a little heavy and has a tinge of pink, but after a while it blends a lot better and looks more natural. In the wrong light, this BB cream looks light, so what I like to do is to add a dab of concealer that is one shade darker than my skintone. It helps to balance out the extra pink and make it slightly darker so that it balances out even better than just applying the cream alone. Also, this cream has a lovely scent of aloe that may be overwhelming to some people, but I love it. Lastly, just like all other BB creams, tinted moisturizers, and foundations, don&#x27;t forget to apply moisturizer underneath!</li>
    <li> I hoped that the undertone would be neutral and it was.  Although I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell (something of a mushroom peach salad), the product was creamy, thick, moisturizing without being greasy, easily blendable, doesn&#x27;t dry too fast but does dry.  Also,it&#x27;s a third of the cost of Dr. Jart, just a much coverage without being oily like Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to get to my house and the product itself seems different than the sample I got of it some months back. It seems to have less coverage and is a bit darker than I remember. But still a pretty good bb cream :)</li>
    <li> Great BB cream! I have tried so many brands and this one is the bast!&lt;br /&gt;The color is great for Asian skin and great moisture!&lt;br /&gt;But I am oil skin, so I feel little greasy after few hours...But since the $$ is great, 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff it&#x27;s my 3rd time buying it!!!! I have fair skin and it looks nice and natural!!! My friends who are tanner than me use it too!!!! You won&#x27;t have to worry about oily skin anymore!!!!! It smells so good and last a long time!!! I gone through 3 of them in 2 years!!!! Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I always wanted to experience Korean BB cream. Unfortunatley, they only make it using lighter Asian skin tones. If you have darker skin, specficially, African American skin, blend with your own foundation to get the benefits of the BB cream.  It is what I did and I am able to use it.</li>
    <li> not much coverage, don&#x27;t like the color much, very small tube and price is not cheaper than other products, I like Missha better</li>
    <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting this stuff to smell as good as it does. It also works nice.</li>
    <li> Great consistency and coverage, color is easy to blend with natural skin tone and does not have a gray undertone like a lot of other BB Creams I&#x27;ve tried. Makes  my face dewy; I pat on powder foundation mid-day for a more matt look but would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping I would like this more than the Peach Sake Skinfood BB cream, but I was a little disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t cover as well, even though there is more product in the packaging and it has its own unique and pleasant scent. I also think it is making me break out, but I have only used it four days, so I will update after having used it more often, since it is not fair to judge in such little time.</li>
    <li> The item arrived faster than scheduled. This Bb cream itself seems to be taking great care of my skin.All you need is a little and it really goes along way. It is slightly lighter when you first put it on but really blends well after</li>
    <li> -absolutely LOVE the packaging&lt;br /&gt;-good value&lt;br /&gt;-has a light creamy texture that melts into skin&lt;br /&gt;-feels moisturizing and soothing&lt;br /&gt;-leaves a Demi-matte finish&lt;br /&gt;-light coverage&lt;br /&gt;-smells awesome! Like fresh apple (real Apple mind you, as in picked off the tree in my backyard, not &amp;#34;Apple scented&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;- gave it 4 stars because the #2 shade is still pretty light. I&#x27;m usually light/medium in the winter and this is juuuust right. I will not be able to use this in the summer cuz I get tan quick. Although considering this is made for korean gals I&#x27;m not surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t speak for the anti aging cuz I&#x27;m 22 but I have oily, acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate or cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the first BB cream I have ever used, and I have to say I&#x27;m hooked! It goes on smooth, smells wonderful and I feel like I can see a difference in my skin in just a week!! I&#x27;m 47 and just now starting to worry about laugh lines and fine lines. This BB cream, makes me glow like I did when I was 20!! I live in SE Texas and it stays on, even in high humidity, without having to re-apply! Looks a little light in color when you first start to apply it, but somehow it evens out and really looks natural and feels light and wonderful! I&#x27;ve recently developed sensitive skin and was a little worried about how my skin might react! The only reaction I&#x27;ve noticed is brighter, softer skin, with the need to use less moisturizer than before!! I&#x27;m definitely ordering more!!</li>
    <li> I picked Natural but it is pretty light.  I just add a little darker liquid makeup to blend it into my skin color.  This is a very good product and looks very natural even on old skin like mine..</li>
    <li> Finally, I found a product that I can apply on my face without looking pancaked up.  It is sheer and blends well with the color of my skin.</li>
    <li> gave this bb cream as a gift to my sons teacher she loved everything about it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Missa BB Cream and thought it was already really good. Then when I started to use this, it was just amazing. The color is warm toned and spreads so easily. Instead of a creamy texture, it is very thin but pigmented color. It feels very moisturizing on my skin and I just put on my moisturizer and then this and I am good to go. I highly highly recommend this. It actually heals my dry skin and keep it nice and not dull. GO BUY IT NOW</li>
    <li> This product is awesome totally recommend the seller and the product!&lt;br /&gt;I just got my product and started to used it it works really well on my face haha...&lt;br /&gt;Makes my face a little lighter  just enough to softly disappear my eye circles .</li>
    <li> While it is light, it still evens out my skin tone.  I need no foundation or powder when I use this.  However, I do still need to use under eye concealer.</li>
    <li> i like how is helping my skin, from breakouts and discolorations, but is a little off color for my skin. im medium olive and is very light.</li>
    <li> Got a natural beige and it&#x27;s so white for me, oily, shiny yet at the same time too dry on the cheeks. I need to mix it with milk lotion and put on face but still not working. For information I&#x27;m Asian, combination dry skin, live in humid area. Want to love it so much since I love skinfood packaging and their concept a lot.</li>
    <li> Just received this in the mail yesterday. I tried it for the first time today with makeup primer, and it lasted all day. People took notice of how nice my skin looked today, and I even noticed as well.  I plan to try it without primer tomorrow, but so far, I love it. I usually use tigi foundation because I liked the coverage. This covers more lightly, but it definitely makes your skin look beautiful! I use this and the salmon concealer by skinfood (that stuff masks my scary raccoon dark circles so well!) This stuff is Soooo much better than any of the American BB creams I&#x27;ve tried. Plus I love that it&#x27;s good for your skin :) makes me feel less guilty when I slather it on my face haha!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely ordering another bottle! :)</li>
    <li> Smells great, and a little bit goes a long way. No weird residues, and it leaves my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> This is awesome makeup, just the perfect shade, goes on smooth, stays nice, makes your face look bright and fresh. I plan to buy again and recommend.</li>
    <li> Has a very herbal smell, not synthetic/chemical and the cream is light, not oily. Blends and primes my skin in minutes and I feel my skin is a bit better at the end of the day.</li>
