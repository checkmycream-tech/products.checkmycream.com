      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel super soft and hydrated after using.</li>
      <li>It really leaves my hair</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>

      <li>It was a bit too heavy for my transitioning hair as a daily moisturizer, but I love it as a leave in!</li>
      <li>Soft and manageable.!</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair both soft and  moisturized !</li>
      <li>However, I can see myself using this when I become completely natural.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair extremely soft and when I touched my hair, there were no tangles.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s why I gave it 4stars because I have to buy it again to see how it actually work on my real hair.</li>
      <li>I am transitioning  and she is natural.</li>
      <li>My hair feels incredibly soft and moisturized</li>

      <li>My hair is left soft, manageable, and hydrated after every use.</li>
      <li>My hair dried quickly also with the blow dryer, and didn&#x27;t need the flat iron.  </li>

<li> I went too heavy the first time, but I left it in all day, as I was staying home anyway.</li>
<li> I am in fact a transitioner (about 7 months) unlike the other reviewers, and my hair type is a 3c/4a as far as I can tell at this point.</li>
<li> If I use one bottle per week or every other week then I may have to find something that lasts longer, but it all depends on how long my natural curls stay tamed or a protective style lasts.</li>
<li> However, since I am transitioning I&#x27;m not sure how much it defines my curls.</li>
<li> and i could of gotten away without even flat ironing it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not that it does anything bad to my hair, but the results are not as good as other moisturizers I have tried.</li>
<li> My hair has always been dry and lifeless from color and blow drying and the flat iron.</li>
<li> I am a middle aged Caucasian woman.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t wait to pair this with the gel souffl&amp;eacute;, so yes I would purchase it again, however it depends on how much I will have to put in my hair because it is beyond thick</li>
<li> The next day (today) I can tell that my hair is EXTREMELY moisturized.</li>
<li> I am comparing it to other products, but overall I feel eh about this.</li>
<li> I usually use Moroccan Oil which is $49 for a tiny bottle (it does last 9-10 months but still!)</li>
<li> My hair doesn&#x27;t dry out during the day which tends to happen with other products.  </li>
<li> Instead of having to use product in the morning, I just fluff up any curls gone awry.</li>
<li> My hair looked wet, like I just washed it, but I could feel and see the smoothness in my hair.</li>
<li> This product gives so much moisture that it is unnecessary to use this every day.</li>
<li> Purchased this product at Target and just put it in my hair the other night while it was damp and slept with a scarf on.</li>
<li> I was using two other lines, i.e. Wen and Carols Daughter.  </li>
<li> and I did not have to use as much as I usually do with other products.</li>
<li> and ive been using it everyday as a moisturizer.</li>
<li> I have to use this everyday in order to maintain moisture, which is not what i planned to do, since it said &amp;#34;extra moisture&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> I use this product everyday on my daughter&#x27;s hair in combination with the curl and style mist.</li>
<li> I have curly hair that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t tame it with products.  </li>
<li> I converted to the Shea Moisture Raw Shea line.  </li>
<li> The hair I brought tangles and hard to manage mess but this product moisturize and take out unruly tangles.</li>
<li> but I get lazy.</li>
<li> unbelievably soft.&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with this product.</li>
<li> And i have hair to my hips its 3b and thick but not too thick.</li>
<li> My hear naturally is a crazy frizzy curly mess</li>
<li> My hair is also VERY thick and sponge-like.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!!!!!!!! It made my hair extremely soft and when I touched my hair, there were no tangles. None at all! Amazing!!! But what I really enjoyed most of all about it is the smell. Will definitely buy it again!!</li>
    <li> At first I really did not like the scent, probably the Argan Oil; it was overwhelming and too sweet. However using it I did notice a big difference and the scent is still there but much less than before and is how some what pleasant. My hair feels incredibly soft and moisturized and I did not have to use as much as I usually do with other products. A good buy worth its price.</li>
    <li> This product is bomb.com! I use it on both myself and my daughter&#x27;s hair. I am transitioning  and she is natural. I use this product everyday on my daughter&#x27;s hair in combination with the curl and style mist. You immediately feel the softness and added moisture and shine as well. This is a must for me. Shea moisture please don&#x27;t ever change anything in the formula. The entire shea butter line is quote awesome.</li>
    <li> Purchased this product at Target and just put it in my hair the other night while it was damp and slept with a scarf on. The next day (today) I can tell that my hair is EXTREMELY moisturized. However, since I am transitioning I&#x27;m not sure how much it defines my curls. But this product is for moisturizing not defining so I guess it serves its purpose! Products like these makes it exciting to be completely natural so I can combine it with a styling gel/cream and see how my hair turns out! Can&#x27;t wait to pair this with the gel souffl&amp;eacute;, so yes I would purchase it again, however it depends on how much I will have to put in my hair because it is beyond thick and I think I am 4C hair (still figuring that out). If I use one bottle per week or every other week then I may have to find something that lasts longer, but it all depends on how long my natural curls stay tamed or a protective style lasts. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It was okay.  the first time i used it was on wet hair after a cowash. it moisturized, and detangled my hair, then i performed a twistout and the very next day, my hair was dry as straw (the twist out came out pretty good, though).  So its not hydrating and did not soften my hair.  I have to use this everyday in order to maintain moisture, which is not what i planned to do, since it said &amp;#34;extra moisture&amp;#34;.  I will not repurchase but i will finish out the bottle.</li>
    <li> I baught this product last week and ive been using it everyday as a moisturizer. Well last night i deep conditioned my hair as i always do weekly, and i rinsed ny deep condidioner out and applied the transitioning milk. I didnt have to use alot only a dime sided amount. And i have hair to my hips its 3b and thick but not too thick. Just alot of hair. Well it works great it made my hair silky and like butter. And it smells like sweet frosting it smells so good!  This is a stable product for me.</li>
    <li> Got the wrong product</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING. I can&#x27;t believe how much I love it. I usually use Moroccan Oil which is $49 for a tiny bottle (it does last 9-10 months but still!) this stuff is wonderful. Smells amazing and my hair is SUPER soft!!! I blew my hair out with my crappy hair dryer and i could of gotten away without even flat ironing it thats how good it looked!! thats unheard of for my hair. My hear naturally is a crazy frizzy curly mess - i call it a fro! I cant believe how much this tamed the beast! Will buy again! (I bought from Walgreens for $9.99)</li>
    <li> This product works well,leaves hair silky smooth esp when used with treseme 7 day keratin smooth heat activated treatment. I use both products while blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff is kind of amazing. It was a bit too heavy for my transitioning hair as a daily moisturizer, but I love it as a leave in! I&#x27;ve completed my transition to natural (type 4 hair, if you&#x27;re interested) and still absolutely love this stuff. I use it as a leave in every week after shampooing or co-washing. Noting compares to this product. My hair is left soft, manageable, and hydrated after every use. However, I did have to get used to the scent. It&#x27;s very strong and very sweet. I highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a great moisturizing product.</li>
    <li> Love this product because it leaves your hair really soft</li>
    <li> Love the accent and it also leavesy dey nappy hair feeling soooo soft and manageable</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for my curls. Soft and manageable.!</li>
    <li> This stuff has got to be one of the best moisturizing milks for my hair! I&#x27;m currently transitioning to natural and I use this milk as a moisturizers in between deep treatments. It leaves my hair both soft and  moisturized ! This will forever be a staple in my regimen!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this Milk!  I am a 3c/4a transitioner and bought this because it said &#x27;transitioning milk&#x27;.  However, I can see myself using this when I become completely natural.  I used this after I cowash and condition and boy does it give lots of &#x27;slip&#x27; to my hair.  It not doubt makes for a great detangler and provides SO much moisture to both my natural hair and my relaxed hair.  I can&#x27;t say enough about how wonderful this product works for me.  Try it for yourself and feel the LOVE...  :-)</li>
    <li> I converted to the Shea Moisture Raw Shea line.  I was using two other lines, i.e. Wen and Carols Daughter.  Both good lines, but expensive.  I was looking for more moisture in a hair lotion.  I live in Las Vegas, and it&#x27;s very dry.  This product smells great and gives me softness to my once dry curls.  I have found a awesome product.</li>
    <li> its just ok didn&#x27;t really do what I wanted it for, which is to keep the hair curly but not knotted.</li>
    <li> I am a middle aged Caucasian woman. My hair has always been dry and lifeless from color and blow drying and the flat iron. This leave-in conditioner is amazing. I went too heavy the first time, but I left it in all day, as I was staying home anyway. My hair looked wet, like I just washed it, but I could feel and see the smoothness in my hair. I washed it the next day, and used a lighter amount of the Shea Moisture, and my hair looked great. It smoothed the cuticles, and my hair actually had bounce and shine! My hair dried quickly also with the blow dryer, and didn&#x27;t need the flat iron.  I went out and bought the shampoo. This is great stuff.</li>
    <li> Wow, all other reviews are good, so I guess I will be the one dissenter... lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not thrilled with this product. I am in fact a transitioner (about 7 months) unlike the other reviewers, and my hair type is a 3c/4a as far as I can tell at this point. My hair is also VERY thick and sponge-like. Walgreens had a BOGO in May so I decided to give it a try. It&#x27;s not that it does anything bad to my hair, but the results are not as good as other moisturizers I have tried. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel super soft and hydrated after using. It also doesn&#x27;t hold my hair together the way that elasta qp does (which is good for bunning or braiding and things like that). My hair still has lots of flyaways with this product although I guess it&#x27;s not intended for hold though. It also smells a bit like marshmallows, sort of cloyingly sweet. It is tolerable but not my favorite smell. Maybe I am just not sold bc I am comparing it to other products, but overall I feel eh about this. Will give it another try soon maybe and see how I feel.</li>
    <li> Oh my...well I am transitioning to natural and this product is great. I use this product every 3 days just ensure moisture is still in my hair. This product gives so much moisture that it is unnecessary to use this every day. This product keeps your hair soft and manageable and I have fell deeply in love with all of products from this line because they work just like they promote. This is my new hair care line!!!</li>
    <li> It works well. I brought it for my natural hair but used it mostly on my micro braids. The hair I brought tangles and hard to manage mess but this product moisturize and take out unruly tangles. If it can do this for the braid hair I know its going to do a great job on my real hair. That&#x27;s why I gave it 4stars because I have to buy it again to see how it actually work on my real hair. It did wonders for this crazy braid hair.</li>
    <li> I LOOOVE this stuff.  First of all, it smells like yummy cake batter LOL.  I have curly hair that tends to be frizzy if I don&#x27;t tame it with products.  This one goes on light and really keeps my hair from frizzing.  My hair doesn&#x27;t dry out during the day which tends to happen with other products.  Yes, this stuff is pricy but I figure it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than what a lot of women choose to pay just to get hair like mine!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried to wrap my hair in silk or satin at night when I go to bed but I get lazy. I&#x27;ve just gotten used to the idea that when I get up in the morning, I need to do anything possible to revitalize my matted, flattened curls. But that was all before I discovered this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3b tight curly hair that is very fine and very dry. This product isn&#x27;t kidding about the extra-moisture. It leaves my hair moisturized for days...not even my pillow can take that away at night. Instead of having to use product in the morning, I just fluff up any curls gone awry. The great thing is that promised extra moisture doesn&#x27;t translate into leaving my hair oily. It really leaves my hair unbelievably soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone with chemical allergies, I also appreciate that this all-natural product doesn&#x27;t give me hives!</li>
