    <li> This is a very high quality sprayer. However, it&#x27;s difficult for someone with a small hand. The bottle itself is quite large and the handle sticks out quite far. While these features are favorable, so that the bottle holds a lot and the sprayer is powerful, my hand has a hard time both fitting around the bottle and reaching the end of the sprayer handle.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent spray bottle, very consistent misty delivery. I use it for sprouting microgreens purposes but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I ordered this water bottle for my ironing task.  I really like it.  I just do not know if I will be able to replace the sprayer should it ware out.  Hopefully, Cricket had a replacement sprayer for the bottle.  The bottle is lightweight and easy to manage.  I just recently purchased it, so I have only used it once.  The spray is a fine mist, which is great for ironing.  I will enjoy using this product.</li>
    <li> I got it pretty quickly and it worked really well. But now this is probably my 3rd week having it and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore for some reason.</li>
    <li> Best spritzer bottle ever!  Why did I wait so long to get this?</li>
    <li> exactly as described.  great quality.  we love using this every morning as we work to get a a alot of hair ready for school  excellent product.</li>
    <li> Wish there was a way to adjust the type of spray coming from the nozzle. What happened to the fine mist option?</li>
    <li> Really a well-made spray bottle that will withstand a lot of use. It&#x27;s a nice change from the cheap plastic ones. I highly recommend this for anyone who uses the Curly Girl method and needs to spray/moisturize your curls. The base is nice and stable and it&#x27;s easy to reach for, well worth it.</li>
    <li> It sprays water on different setting which is a plus but the bottle leaks and it sprays a little to much</li>
    <li> Very durable metal bottle and the spray head is made of good, solid material so each squeeze of the trigger gets a quality spray.</li>
    <li> Works as described. Very sturdy and arived promptly.. Doesn&#x27;t tip over very easily.. I enjoy working with it in my class.</li>
    <li> This is an expensive spray bottle. The least you expect is to receive it in a good condition. It arrived dented! Had read other reviews with the same complain, but disregarded them as bad luck. No, it seems this seller doesn&#x27;t care how ítems arrive. It&#x27;s ashame!</li>
    <li> Great spray bottle for cloth diaper wipe solution</li>
    <li> product is exactly as described.  Better quality than your usual plastic water bottle that becomes inoperable after several months.  Like the fact that it is aluminum.  Saw it on the counter at my stylist&#x27;s, which is why I looked for it online.  Arrived very quickly and well packaged from seller.  Tracking # was also provided promptly.  Will look for similar items from them if needed in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, SalonGuys!</li>
    <li> This is a quality water bottle sprayer. I can adjust it to a fine mist or a jet of water. It&#x27;s good all around.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, reliable plastic pump sprayer on an aluminum body. What more could you ask for? Maybe someone to spray it for you.</li>
    <li> The aluminum is light but still pretty sturdy, functions as expected.</li>
    <li> We use this to make our own cleaner with essential oils.  works great!</li>
    <li> looks great, but you have to pump it a few times before the water comes out.</li>
    <li> I only received the metal bottom portion of the bottle, no sprayer or tube parts.  I got totally ripped off!  I checked the box, it wasn&#x27;t there.</li>
