      <li>I love the product..</li>
      <li>If I was going to pay that price, I wanted to make sure that it would work and  not adversely  affect my skin.</li>
      <li>Over the years I had seen the print ads in so many beauty magazines.  </li>
      <li>I was hoping for something more noticable.</li>
      <li>My skin looks way more glowy and</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Love It.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t get the full size!</li>
      <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t charge much, mostly just free products.  </li>
      <li>Skin is more even toned and smooth...</li>
      <li>-I have an incredibly oily t-zone and dry cheeks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also available for purchase on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Significant skin improvement .Love</li>
      <li>But the product does the right thing!</li>
      <li>I love the SK-II product and this seller provided it at a very competitive price.  </li>
      <li>The reason why they give the products is to hope you come back and buy more stuff!</li>
      <li>It is sample, but be smart, the sample is always better if it is real stuff.</li>
      <li>The facial masks are also amazing.</li>
      <li>It kind of smells the same</li>
      <li>My skin just &amp;#34;drinks&amp;#34; it right up.</li>
      <li>Very gentle and using this in combination with the Cenoire 24k Beaute Bar.  </li>
      <li>Should a full bottle price be as high as it is?-No.</li>
      <li>but i love when a product actually does what it promise.these is one of those.</li>
      <li>The first night I put it on, I wiped my eyes when I woke up</li>
      <li>This is a sample, not the real product!</li>
      <li>you are using acne medication, you probably want to try out small bottles for a period of time and see which combination works best for you before you make an investment and buy a big bottle.</li>
      <li>Love this product....has a miniscule smell, not unpleasant to me, as other reviewers have stated.  </li>
      <li>and I feel a positive difference in my product performance there.</li>
      <li>i love this essence, and thanks to seller and amazon, i can enjoy it everyday at this&lt;br /&gt;size and price...</li>
      <li>but this one smells much stronger.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is even the real product...</li>
      <li>It really improved my skin in whitening and dryness.  </li>
      <li>This product may very well work for others, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
      <li>I like to by this 30ml size cuz the price reasonable.</li>
      <li>I received this item as a official sample that should given away for Sk-ii promotion and/or marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the Essence working good on me, although I didn&#x27;t see too dramatic change but overall better skin condition.</li>
      <li>I like this essence a lot, but not enough to pay for a full sized one.</li>
      <li>I WILL purchase the full size bottle in the future.</li>
      <li>and giving it that extra boost to compliment worthy skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if its a bit older</li>
      <li>but I think psychologically it makes me think the other products I&#x27;m using are absorbing better.</li>
      <li>I did notice after about 2 weeks of use that my skin&#x27;s texture was way softer, my oilyness lessened (not perfectly matte but an improvement with how oilly it used to get), but most significantly my skin tone and clarity was noticiably boosted.</li>
      <li>I saw zero difference, and usually notice an immediate difference with even the cheapest products, so I was expecting so much more.</li>
      <li>Sample is always a gift along with the certain product of the same brand.</li>
      <li>I am 25 years old and have been battling acne sine</li>
      <li>kinda like lighter and young looking.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying Missha Time Revolution essence &amp; so far it seems comparable.</li>
      <li>so far I like it</li>
      <li>Last time I ordered one to have a try see if it is real thing.</li>
      <li>I have no wrinkles yet as 29 yr old.</li>
      <li>I did notice my skin seemed a bit more even and less dry, but it didn&#x27;t help me keep my skin hydrated.</li>
      <li>Maybe I would notice a big difference if I was much older?</li>
      <li>Maybe I am not subtle enough to know</li>
      <li>, I haven&#x27;t seen major changes to my face</li>
      <li>Since I semi-stopped using my acne medicine to see if this could substitute that could be a major reason.</li>
      <li>At first i was concern because of the size of the product ( tiny bottle) but it really last long...</li>
      <li>30ml$18, 150ml$90, this is much cheaper than other store the bottle of 150ml.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any negative effects after using this small 30ml bottle, in fact my skin became more vibrant, supple and softer.</li>
      <li>(Typical of the Skin Care Product Industry, which seems to be absolutely un-regulated.  </li>
      <li>I developed bumps and dry areas all over.  </li>
      <li>It arrived with no instructions which I would have found useful because it&#x27;s hard to know if something&#x27;s working without knowing the recommended usage - do you put it on by hand or using cotton balls?  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this, but also cant say anything good about it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Am those kind a person who&#x27;s ,..never complain about toner.&lt;br /&gt;But this SKII ,..good product,..high brand in the market. But sadly,..not event move me bit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is even the real product...I saw zero difference, and usually notice an immediate difference with even the cheapest products, so I was expecting so much more. It was like rubbing water on my face.</li>
    <li> I received this item as a official sample that should given away for Sk-ii promotion and/or marketing.&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, the Essence working good on me, although I didn&#x27;t see too dramatic change but overall better skin condition.</li>
    <li> I love the SK-II product and this seller provided it at a very competitive price.  She was also friendly and had great communication.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this stuff for long time now, but the price got in the way. If I was going to pay that price, I wanted to make sure that it would work and  not adversely  affect my skin. So this trial size was perfect as a trial run. I WILL purchase the full size bottle in the future.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find this product to meet any of the expectations which the company leads you to believe will occur.  (Typical of the Skin Care Product Industry, which seems to be absolutely un-regulated.  Skip it!</li>
    <li> I am not really see the different after i use it for a month but i like it i think.</li>
    <li> 30ml$18, 150ml$90, this is much cheaper than other store the bottle of 150ml. Last time I ordered one to have a try see if it is real thing. IT IS real and very good on my face. So I ordered 2 bottle this time, it does took about two weeks to get here. But the product does the right thing! Love it! Going to order 5 bottles this time. It is even cheaper than the duty free! It is sample, but be smart, the sample is always better if it is real stuff. Why? Sample is always a gift along with the certain product of the same brand. The reason why they give the products is to hope you come back and buy more stuff! So they won&#x27;t mess up with samples!</li>
    <li> This is the best hydrating treatment for my skin. I put it on before my daytime and nighttime moisturizers. My face feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Significant skin improvement .Love it . The manafacture date is 2013 also .I will buy the bigger one .Great .</li>
    <li> Love it! Love it! Love it, i tried this product out of curiosity because the reviews call it one of the best cosmetic products 2014, price was afordable, and wanted to give it a tried. At first i was concern because of the size of the product ( tiny bottle) but it really last long...so far, 2 months and not even half of the bottle empty. Is part of my morning prep before makeup, not oily, refresh the skin, after one week makes it look tider..kinda like lighter and young looking. Not miracle but i love when a product actually does what it promise.these is one of those. Customer for life! Only thing wish shipping was faster.... I think it comes from japan</li>
    <li> I love the product..I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months. It really improved my skin in whitening and dryness.  I like to by this 30ml size cuz the price reasonable.</li>
    <li> I like it, I just wish I had been able to afford to purchase more of SK II products to see how wonderful they probably are when used together.  Sadly, I&#x27;ll never be able to afford that much money...perhaps they&#x27;d like to use me as a before and after person for their many products, I wouldn&#x27;t charge much, mostly just free products.  :)</li>
    <li> Got this to try after reading an article in Elle magazine extolling the virtues of facial essence...so far I like it, I haven&#x27;t seen major changes to my face but I think psychologically it makes me think the other products I&#x27;m using are absorbing better. Been using it undereye also and I feel a positive difference in my product performance there.</li>
    <li> It arrived with no instructions which I would have found useful because it&#x27;s hard to know if something&#x27;s working without knowing the recommended usage - do you put it on by hand or using cotton balls?  The first night I put it on, I wiped my eyes when I woke up and I guess got it in my eyes BURNS!!!  Not sure if it works because I&#x27;m not very dedicated seeing that it burns &amp; I don&#x27;t know how/when to use...  I&#x27;ll see what turns up.  Their website is not that helpful either... they could give you recommendations on which products to use and how to use them....</li>
    <li> Love this product. The facial masks are also amazing.</li>
    <li> I ordered this through another vendor previously. I am not sure why its different but this one smells much stronger. I don&#x27;t know if its a bit older but it&#x27;s hard to put on b/c of the smell.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful this product would work so I ordered the smaller trial size.  Over the years I had seen the print ads in so many beauty magazines.  Unfortunately, this product did nothing but irritate all my pores and sensitive skin.  I developed bumps and dry areas all over.  I used it for 2 weeks daily, and finally stopped due to the irritation.  This product may very well work for others, but it wasn&#x27;t for me.  I ended up using RevaleSkin with coffee-berry night cream with great results.  It&#x27;s also available for purchase on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before from a department store and loved it. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the real deal. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in my skin as I did with the other one. It kind of smells the same so it may be the same but think it&#x27;s a watered down version.</li>
    <li> This is not SKII Facial Essence.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  I spent 15 bucks on phony product.</li>
    <li> This is a great toner after cleansing your face.  You can see the difference between this and other toners. I would buy this again</li>
    <li> Great product! Made my skin look more moisturized and brighter! For those that haven&#x27;t tried this product yet, your definitely missing out!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for taking pretty good skin- not breaking out, not too hyperpigmented etc. and giving it that extra boost to compliment worthy skin. I did notice after about 2 weeks of use that my skin&#x27;s texture was way softer, my oilyness lessened (not perfectly matte but an improvement with how oilly it used to get), but most significantly my skin tone and clarity was noticiably boosted. My skin looks way more glowy and even -oned (I don&#x27;t look sallow or like I need sleep). That is the greatest difference and this is the only product that boosted my radiance in any noticable way. I look like I&#x27;m wearing BB cream/tinted mositurizer even with no makeup on. Didn&#x27;t break me out or anything. Love it. I see why it has a cult following.</li>
    <li> Love It. My face is Very smooth And bright. THANK you SK-II</li>
    <li> Love this product....has a miniscule smell, not unpleasant to me, as other reviewers have stated.  Skin is more even toned and smooth...</li>
    <li> My skin feels softer, but no noticable visual difference. I was hoping for something more noticable. Not sure if I would buy again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this, but also cant say anything good about it. Maybe I am not subtle enough to know/see a difference, but it felt no different to my skin than a regular toner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard raving reviews about this product and bought a smaller bottle to try out. I didn&#x27;t see any negative effects after using this small 30ml bottle, in fact my skin became more vibrant, supple and softer. However as I bought the bigger bottle for this, little tiny pimples started to pop up everywhere. Since I semi-stopped using my acne medicine to see if this could substitute that could be a major reason. It was hard to juggle this along with my acne medication, I probably used my acne medication 4/7 days of the week and used this 7/7 days of the week. Unfortunately even that combination broke me out. Sadly, I had to give away my larger bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using acne medication, you probably want to try out small bottles for a period of time and see which combination works best for you before you make an investment and buy a big bottle.</li>
    <li> I am not 100% sold on this product, but for the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve used it I can honestly say it hasn&#x27;t caused any problems with my skin. I use it twice a day and at first I thought this small bottle would only last a few days, but you actually use very little and I still have enough left to use twice a day for another few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is combo-I have an incredibly oily t-zone and dry cheeks. I am 25 years old and have been battling acne sine I was 20. I bought this product thinking it might help my acne in some way since salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide have done nothing. I&#x27;ve even tried Retin-A and antibiotics as well as birth control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product in no way cured my acne or was a miracle. But I feel like it has helped to even out my skin tone even though I still have a lot of scarring from my acne. It didn&#x27;t cause my t-zone to become oilier (than it already is) and I find that it provides enough moisture to replace heavy moisturizers for during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything I would say this product &amp;#34;livens&amp;#34; up my skin, especially since I travel a lot and after a few hours on the road my skin looks pretty awful. Should a full bottle price be as high as it is?-No. It definitely isn&#x27;t a miracle solution so I definitely feel guilty about spending nearly $200 for a full size.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of hormonal acne on my chin. I used it for 3 weeks striaght, morning and night after washing my face. This doesn&#x27;t do anything to alleviate that. I did notice my skin seemed a bit more even and less dry, but it didn&#x27;t help me keep my skin hydrated. I still have to put on moisturizing cream. The weather in L.A. has been crazy dry lately and my skin flaked like crazy in my dry spots. the SK-II didnt seem to help. Maybe I would notice a big difference if I was much older? I have no wrinkles yet as 29 yr old. I go get monthly facials, and I am religious when it comes to upkeep for my face. This sample size is the perfect way to try it, so I gave 3 stars. So glad I didn&#x27;t get the full size!</li>
    <li> It took two weeks to get here. Everythng was written in Chinese except the word SAMPLE. No directions for use. I paid close or $30 for a sample!!!! Only reason I bought it was Cate Blanchard&#x27;s endorsement in a glamor magazine. Other products in this line cost well over $100. I wasn&#x27;t about to spend that kind of money without testing the product.</li>
    <li> it is a good product from SK-II.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves good impression with its soft toning quality .&lt;br /&gt;A perfect purchase for  your skin</li>
    <li> This is a sample, not the real product! When I received it, it just a bottle without any pack! It&#x27;s a giveaway product which can&#x27;t be sold. So don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
    <li> I like this essence a lot, but not enough to pay for a full sized one. I&#x27;m trying Missha Time Revolution essence &amp; so far it seems comparable.</li>
    <li> Very gentle and using this in combination with the Cenoire 24k Beaute Bar.  Only time will tell how the results will look.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t sealed and also as I got the package, the liquide was gushed out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> i love this essence, and thanks to seller and amazon, i can enjoy it everyday at this&lt;br /&gt;size and price...love sk-ii...great buy for me!</li>
    <li> In love with this... Had it for 3days and I&#x27;m hooked. Going to need a big bottle. Bought the small one to try it out and I love it. My skin just &amp;#34;drinks&amp;#34; it right up. It absorbs so well into the skin and my face is luminous. Just love it!</li>
