<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pleased with service and product</li>
    <li> The product was not sealed properly! The pump was not taped, it was just in a ziplock plastic bag. When it arrived the pump was open and the liquid/cleanser was all over the plastic! It was such a waste!</li>
    <li> This face cleanser is amazing. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I absolutely see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Skin is soft and smooth.  This product doesn&#x27;t over dry like others I have used in the past.  Nonirritating.  Will continue to use this in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> I like it, I love it, works great for sensitive skin, but remember to not use it near your eyes</li>
    <li> My acne is primarily hormonal and stress related. I&#x27;m 40 and female. I get the chin and upper neck cystic acne and this helps calm my breakouts. I discovered it when I got a facial by my &amp;#34;Botox lady&amp;#34;. She sold it at the salon she&#x27;s at by advised me to order off Amazon as it is cheaper. My teens use it and it calms their oily skin white head breakouts. Be sure to use the jan marini transformation eye cream at any age! It&#x27;s never too early.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  I have tried numerous others and this is the best.  Have been using it for about 5 years.  Make your face feel clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> I am a 75-year-old male, sounds weird to others that in spite of my age I maintain a skin care regimen!!!  In my case, I use Jan Marini Biologic Facial Cleanser as Step 1 in my daily skin care routine. It&#x27;s effective, mild, and the result of using this product is very pleasing. I use it in the morning and before going to bed in the evening.  This is not a sales pitch. My supple flawless skin is the proof of what I have just said.</li>
    <li> The best face wash! I will be ordering again right when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> As directed, always use a clean washcloth (I use the same one for both wet and dry application) and always use this on dry skin, but I&#x27;ve learned to leave it on for at least five minutes for it to really be effective. I even put it on before I take a bath then wash it off as instructed afterwards. My skin seems to love it.</li>
    <li> I have used Jan marini cleanser for almost 6 years. I constantly have people guessing me at 30. Is very flattering. I&#x27;m 40! It&#x27;s my little secret! This product is beyond all others. I recommend it to everyone who asks about my skin care. I do use a firming moisturiser from another company. But I&#x27;ve tried other glycolic cleansers from others like Mario Badesku etc. And I always come back to Jan. Love the prices from this vendor, fast shipping, my go to when I need more!</li>
    <li> Very good seems to sting a lot but think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s working very fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have found this to be the best cleanser for refining pores and improving skin texture on my face.  it has made a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> After a spa treatment and facial, I discovered this product and paid &amp;#34;spa prices.&amp;#34;  No longer!  I was very impressed to find this product available via Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years and am quite pleased.  There is no objectionable odor, and it takes off make-up without drying out your skin.</li>
    <li> My feet, hands and legs have never felt so smooth!  Introduced my friends to it and they love it too!</li>
    <li> Really like the Jan Marino facial cleanser very much. Will re order again when I am out. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but I always come back to this.</li>
    <li> After mdforte discontinue their facial wash, I tried multiple products to compare. This one is the best.  I have been using it for a year now and it may wen be tether then mdforte&#x27;s Glycolic facial wash.</li>
    <li> Love it. I have used it for years and swear by this stuff. The vendor was very prompt... I ordered on a Saturday and received product on Monday, which was Memorial Day.. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great product!  I love this face wash!  Good price!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by an esthetician after she gave me a facial. It is supposed to help slough off dead skin cells, I believe. My skin feels deeply cleaned by this cleanser, but doesn&#x27;t leave it dry. I&#x27;ve used it for years and continue to re-order it.</li>
    <li> gift for daughter. she&#x27;s thrilled with it !</li>
    <li> OMG!!! Great for uneven skin. It gave me clarity in my skin and helped minimizing my pores. I recommend for everyone to give this a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years. I&#x27;d been to several dermatologists and had been on EVERY rx acne treatment, and nothing had worked. A friend of mine gave me a g/c to see an aestheticism for my b-day, and she suggested the Jan Marini skin care line. I started using it, and everything changed! It&#x27;s just amazing. Now I have clear skin that I have had for YEARS, and I love it. It was the best gift I ever got. It&#x27;s completely worth the money, and you&#x27;ll want to get it with the Bioclear Lotion. It&#x27;s not actually a lotion, it&#x27;s a gel that kills acne. Also, a great tip... When you wash your face, put the cleanser on with dry hands and a dry face. Massage it into your face for about 30 seconds, (you&#x27;ll kind of start to feel it getting in your skin), then rinse, and repeat with wet hands and face. Then after you&#x27;ve dried your face apply the Bioclear Lotion. Your skin is going to be a little bit sad for a few weeks, and it may peel a bit, but then one day you&#x27;ll wake up and have the best skin of your life! I promise! Good luck to anyone out there who is super frustrated with acne. I hope you find this and it helps you. Having great skin really does change your life, and you will have it if you use Jan Marini products. Give them a try!</li>
    <li> Great product! The only downfall is the smell is slightly weird, but it works great so I block it out.</li>
    <li> It made my skin clearer and smoother. I would buy it again. It doesn&#x27;t really lighten dark spots dramatically though. I like the method of putting it on dry skin before washing it off.</li>
    <li> This is a good cleanser, and it was delivered on time and just want I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Doe not lather even a little and find myself having to use more than I normally would to get it spread around when I use it on a cleansing, facial brush.  If I just use it with my fingers, I use less.  I much prefer the C-Esta.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product which is also great product that stops acne breakouts! Cleanses and works effectively like it should! I&#x27;ve used this product for well over fifteen years!</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for a few months now and I love it. Definitely improved my skin, although I am still prone to occasional break outs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with cleansers in the last few months and, without a doubt, this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used so far - in my life. Seriously...it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on sensitive or breakout prone skin but it really tackles the dirt, grime, oil and gently exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;It can bring impurities lurking beneath your skin but they&#x27;re gone by the morning.  I am so impressed with this stuff, there&#x27;s a definite repurchase in my future and will look at more Jan Marini products as well.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  read the directions - don&#x27;t use around the eyes, use a warm face cloth to wash off and rinse thoroughly.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used to date.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used Estee Lauder products, but this is by far the best product out there.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and my pores tend to clog (wearing Estee Lauder!?) and the lycolic acid in this cleanser makes all the difference in the world.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I can&#x27;t use it in the shower since you have to apply it to dry skin and then wipe with a towel before rinsing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for many years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that works for my skin. I have combination skin and do still experience some breakouts in my mid-30s. This wash (especially combined with the Clarisonic) is really great at helping the breakouts to go away quicker and prevent new ones from coming. I continue to reorder this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite cleanser. I have tried at least 50 other cleansers in the past 10 years - You know how it is! I finally learned my lesson. Jan Marini is the best for those of us with combination skin in the 40+ range.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and was recommended to use it from a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It works for me.</li>
    <li> great product, and arrived quickly</li>
    <li> Burns a little but not too much. I have sensitive skin. I use this mainly when I travel and can&#x27;t bring my clarisonic to exfoliate. It helps to keep pores from clogging up and I believe it works as advertised. Fair price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Tames my acneic skin, which was getting especially stubborn around my chin line and sensitive neck. I use this in alternation with the papaya Skinzyme. Important! Apply to dry skin and leave for a bit before rinsing thoroughly. This should not be used as a make up remover.</li>
    <li> I tried it the first day it plumped up my wrinkles, after the first day only lasted a couple of hours if you eat or drink, then the wrinkles come back. The dispenser broke.</li>
    <li> Fake product. I&#x27;ve used this product for years, this one was a different consistency and smell than real Jan Marini product.</li>
    <li> Brightens my face and lightens dark spots.</li>
    <li> Got this recommended to me after visiting my dermatologist. I was suffering with acne clusters on my chin and around my mouth. Within one week of using this alongside the biogycolic lotion and jan marini transformation serum my skin had cleared up completely. The only trace of my acne was a bit of scarring (for this I used Heliocare sun cream spf50 as exposure to sun light gives those ugly purple marks) but overall this wash is brilliant I will never stop using it!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Jan Marini products for many years and receive compliments on my skin a lot.  I love the skin care line.  A little pricey compared to drug store products.  Certainly better price than some high end department store products.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by an dermatologist. It simply works. I use it every time I shower and my skin looks fresh and toned.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this cleanser!  I bought this after a recommendation from my new aesthetician.  She has amazing skin and I asked her about her skin regime.  She let me in on this secret cleanser of hers, along with PCA products (which I will also review) and have been using this for a few weeks, twice a day.  My skin has never looked better!!  It has glycolic acid in it, but it is gentle, does not hurt your skin or face, and yes!  You can use it twice a day!!  :)  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have dealt with acne all my life, and still do at 38 years old! I have tried EVERYTHING!!! Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and not everything works the same for everyone, but every time I try something different (trying to save some money) it never works for my skin and I always come back to Jan Marini. I used to use the 4 step system, cleanser, c-esta serum, bioglycolic lotion, and transformation cream. For a couple years now, I have reduced it to just the bioglycolic facial cleanser, and sometimes the transformation cream, when my skin feels a little dry, but my acne is not acne anymore. I may get a couple pimples from time to time, but that is it! I am so glad to have discovered such a great product line!!! I have been using Jan Marini for more than 10 years now, and when I see people I went to high school with, they all say I don&#x27;t look like I aged at all, so that is a plus as well! :)</li>
    <li> Great product, and a lot cheaper than most Glycolic</li>
    <li> This is a great face wash. If I use it consistently day and evening it keeps my face clear. I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Have been using Jan Marini products for years.  Love it!  Keeps my very sensitive skin smooth and clear of blemishes.</li>
    <li> I love this cleaner and happy it&#x27;s offered on Amazon. My skin was in complete turmoil when I started using this product. Just 8.5 weeks later my skin is clear and luminous...to the point where those closest to me have complimented my skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser does a great job of cleaning the face. I like also that it does not dry out my face as some other products have done. I feel like I get a thorough cleaning with this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this facial cleanser for years and it really works! It is great for skin that is not so young anymore, yet still suffers from some acne. It is also a very gentle cleanser. Does not leave my face feeling dry, just clean and moist.</li>
    <li> IT A FAKE!Did someone put hair shampoo in the empty bottle and now claims it to be Bioglacolic Facial Cleanser? I have used Jan Marini products for 3 years now. The consistency, color, smell are off! DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Nice hard to find product for a good price.  I would definitely order another again.  It gently cleanses the skin without leaving it dry.</li>
    <li> I order this all the time - great product!</li>
    <li> This product tingles when it goes on and you can really FEEL it working.  You skin is smooth and shines after a week.  Perfect product with results!</li>
    <li> Live this product best face wash ever</li>
    <li> Made me break out. I had to stop using it</li>
    <li> I use this a few times a week in combination with Jan Marini Bioglycolic Facial Cleanser daily, my skin couldn&#x27;t look better!  The men in my house prefer the Mario Badescu and because this product you use on dry skin, which makes the cleaning regimen a bit difficult for them.  We all have different skin types in my house, but we are all noticing better skin and smaller pores and less blackheads and acne.  I am a new user and will stay a user for life!!!</li>
    <li> Srinks pores. Gentle. I will continue to use.i can really tell a difference.  I was told I would like results.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and absolutely love it. I purchased this because it was half the price. Well you get what you pay for. It is not the real thing. Wrong color top and different ingredients. I noticed it immediately. Don&#x27;t buy this!!!!</li>
    <li> Skin feels softer and cleaner</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; as it is more of an exfoliate  and something you&#x27;d get at a facial (stings a bit but in a good way), but I was pleasantly surprised. Especially in the summer, you get that nice feeling of knowing that dead layer of skin is cleared off and you are starting with a clean slate. I use it every third day. It leaves no redness anymore than a scrub would and really works well (better than a scrub imho).</li>
    <li> This product is not authentic. Fake or expired.</li>
    <li> Great product  love all Marini products i&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> works great at a good price</li>
    <li> Works great at cleaning skin and opening up pores. Works great in combination with Jan Marini Bioglycolic Face Cream. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jan Marini biologic cleanser for a little more than a year. I bought it after reading that it&#x27;s wise to change your skin cleanser from time to time, and I alternate the Jan Marini with another super face wash, MD Formulations glycolic cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s the glycolic acid that does the wonderful job of exfoliating, and I leave it on at night for a minute or two to help slough off any flakeys. I notice a more even skin tone. It also lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The best part: Amazon sells it and at a cheaper price than where I have been buying it. If only I knew! Jan Marini is hard to find. Now maybe I can afford to try the c-ester or other Jan Marini product which also get good reviews.</li>
    <li> I had to give this seller 1 star in order to write this review but they really don&#x27;t deserve even one.&lt;br /&gt;Where to begin....1) I was charged for my full order but only received part of it. 2) the products I did receive were previously opened, one exploded in the cheap shipping packaging, all of the product numbers were burned off the bottles and none of the items had any type of safety seals. 3) I tried to contact the seller but never received any response. Had it not been for Amazons return policy I would have been out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;Worse part.... After this happened I researched the seller more and read this same complaint over and over again.</li>
    <li> Love it!! My face is so clean I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in one wash love</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin for years.  I tried everything from Kiel&#x27;s, Philosophy, to dermalogica, and nothing helped my skin like Jan Marini.  I recommend this to everyone and its well worth the price.  One bottle lasts 3 months or more.</li>
    <li> great product&lt;br /&gt;great price</li>
    <li> Absolutely spectacular product.  I&#x27;m a fairly unfinicky guy when it comes to my appearance, but I do break out a bit even at my age, and Jan Marini basically eliminates that issue.  A single bottle will last you far longer than you think it will.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for a long time. It&#x27;s the best non-foaming cleanser I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s sensitive yet effective for my skin. My face never dries out using this. It&#x27;s not the best at removing makeup bu works great with the Clarisonic because it doesn&#x27;t foam up and it rinses easily. Be sure to apply to dry skin per the instructions for the best results.</li>
    <li> I clean first with cetaphil to make sure I get my eye makeup off.  This works best when you start with a dry face and scrub with a warm washcloth or other scrubber.  Keep away from eyes.  It gives my face a fresh feel and I like the tingling when I&#x27;m cleaning my face.</li>
    <li> Jan Marini Bioglycolic Cleanser gets the work done. It is gentle and a great alternative to using annoying soap products.  It&#x27;s creamy yet effective.  Not only is this the best bioglycolic facial wash, but Amazon has the best  price.  I always buy more than 1 because it holds its strength and effectiveness without becoming oily or runny.  Try it for the best facial results.</li>
    <li> I am not really happy with this product,  I find that every time I use it, I wake up with whiteheads,  so I stop using, will maybe try it again in a few weeks, and once a day not the recommend twice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week now and have really noticed a change in my skin. My acne is slowly, but surely clearing up. It was hard at first to follow the steps for using this product. I actually went and purchased some baby wash cloths for after I have rubbed the product on my dry skin and have to wipe it off with a damp rag. The baby wash cloths are much softer than the regular ones and don&#x27;t feel as rough on my skin. I am hopeful that this product will continue to work wonders on my skin!</li>
    <li> there is a process to using the Jan Marini line of products.  the first step is alway clean skin.  best is to use this face wash.  great price for quality.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, simple and effective. I see a difference in a week or so when I stop using it. Going on my fifth bottle of this stuff</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with a glycolic cleanser. It is easy to use, and the results are great, wish I had found it sooner. My skin is looking better, brighter, smoother.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so different when I use this product.  Less breakouts and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.  Great product</li>
    <li> Cant tell this product does any thing at all, goes on greasy, does not leave a clean feeling on face.</li>
    <li> This is the best price that I have ever found on this soap.  Its the same as the $30 bottles sold everywhere else.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Always makes my face nice smooth and no acne!!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  I would recommend.  A little goes a long way with this stuff.  Gives your face a fresh clean feel yet not a dry feel.  I use the Age Intervention Face Serum after.  I may try more of the steps but they are a little pricey and wanted to try out these two products 1st!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and have found the best price for it on amazon, it&#x27;s glycolic, I have good skin that can take it, if your skin is dry, it might not work or very sensitive</li>
    <li> Jan marini is amazing. Very gentle on the skin but extremely great results. If you are of more mature skin this will become your best friend. All the products for dry mature skin are of top quality with incredible results. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I buy Jan Marini Bioglycolic line on Amazon because its cheaper here than anywhere I can buy it in town. Ive used it for years, its like getting a mini peel every time you use it. Im 36 and people tell me they thought I was 21 when they find out. I love this line !</li>
    <li> I like that this cleanser is a little on the creamy side so it&#x27;s not too drying</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says and is pretty intense. I have sort of sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything. It definitely burns though. In the beginning I only used it once every couple of days, but I&#x27;ve worked up to using it twice a day now. Sometimes I&#x27;ll back off if my face tells me to. :) Has improved the clarity, tone, and firmness of my skin - although I&#x27;ve started using a lot of other anti-aging products. I feel like this cleanser does a great job of preparing my skin for all the other stuff I put on it. I&#x27;m 34, and most people think I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Better than I thought it would be.  Did not break my face out, I only use it two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible! I made the mistake of buying this and I regret wasting my money. If you are prone to acne like me, look at the ingredients. Cetly and Stearyl alcohol are listed a \\&quot;2\\&quot; on the comedogenic ingredients list. Yeah, a \\&quot;2\\&quot; isn&#x27;t terrible based on the scale of 0 to 5, but considering these two ingredients are two of the first four ingredients of this product it scares me. Having said that, I tried to ignore it thinking, \\&quot;they are only a 2 on the scale\\&quot;, but I kept breaking out. Furthermore, it literally feels like rubbing your hair conditioner all over your face when your using this product, your skin does not feel clean but kind of greasy like a slime layer is left behind.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was working and washed my face with it 3 nights in a row.  Then my face started peeling.  Now I have backed off to 3 times a week.  It does work..</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, no scent which is nice.</li>
    <li> This is the best face cleaner ever!!! I love how smooth my face feels! It works great with step 2 and Step 4. Not sure why... but I didn&#x27;t order step 3. All the Jan Marini products are worth the price.</li>
    <li> Not convinced it is real or maybe old.</li>
    <li> Great product, quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this Jan Marini facial cleanser on and off for years.  It&#x27;s mild enough not to break out or irritate the skin and I really love that.  I&#x27;m always looking for the perfect cleanser and every so often I go back to this when I&#x27;m disappointed in another product. It doesn&#x27;t disappoint but it doesn&#x27;t turn me on, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a skincare perspective, using a bioglycolic in a cleanser (that spends so little time on the face) doesn&#x27;t really add much value to your skin.  Still, this product isn&#x27;t THAT expensive and it doesn&#x27;t harm the skin.</li>
    <li> Amazing cleanser! I&#x27;ve had horrible skin from day one. Thousands of dollars spent trying to find something that targets all areas.&lt;br /&gt;Jan Marini products are the best thus far.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser. Leaves my face fresh and clean without feeling dry.</li>
    <li> or rather, skin-saver. i&#x27;ve never had better-looking skin, after so many years of struggling with acute acne--and now adult acne. i&#x27;m no longer afraid to go out without makeup. THANK YOU jan marini!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it consistently but I feel a regular cleanser works way better than this pricy cleanser. Waste of money!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My teenage girls really like this product</li>
    <li> This is fake. I bought one from my esthetician and it is completely different from this fake one. It smells like chemicals, the color is off, and the texture is off too. DO NOT BUY THIS!!</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser. Use a sponge with it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> Bought this to avoid buying more cleansers with harmful micro beads.  Didn&#x27;t like it at all - was really surprised this made &amp;#34;top reviews&amp;#34; on the review sites.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but not the greatest...</li>
    <li> This is the best cleanser I have EVER used!!  My sister in law told me about it after receiving a recommendation for it.  I have been fighting acne for several years now and NOTHING has worked...until now.  After only using it for 3 days, the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> It works really nice.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have acne until my late 20&#x27;s. Nothing over-the-counter worked. Proactive didn&#x27;t work, and my doctor felt Accutane was extreme since my acne was not considered severe. I started using Jan Marini products about 2 years ago. I use this cleanser once or twice daily along with the 10% benzoyl peroxide lotion and the SPF moisturizer, and my adult acne is mostly gone. I still have small whitehead clusters on my cheeks where my skin collects a lot of oil, but they&#x27;re only noticeable in front of a lit mirror. I&#x27;ve just purchased retinol to try to help clear that up, but I consider the war on zits and pimples won. An added bonus: I just reordered this product nearly one year from the last time I ordered it so it goes a long way if used sparingly and you can&#x27;t beat $20 for that shelf life.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is amazing!!! As an esthetician, I&#x27;m really picky about products, but after reading all the great reviews I had to try it! The product is exactly what I was looking for...no unpleasant fragrance, and Glycolic as the second active ingredient...can&#x27;t beat that! This stuff works FAST!!! I expected to see results after a week maybe...but NO, they came after the first use!! This product is very strong, so I would use it as recommended. It tingles on anything that is active on your skin, that&#x27;s an indication it&#x27;s working! I loveeee this cleanser, and am looking forward to trying more from this line.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years (almost 20) and I LOVE IT!  I am 70 years old, and whenever I go for a facial I am told that I have great skin, and I am always amazed.  As a teenager, and even into my 30&#x27;s I had problems with acne.  I have been left with many small scars, but no one seems to notice. I am especially pleased when that happens during a facial, as they are seeing my skin in it&#x27;s most basic state.  This facial cleanser does not lather at all, as a soap would, put instead gently does the  work of a cleanser that leaves your face feeling very clean and soft.</li>
    <li> IT COULD BE DIFFERENT FOR ALL SKINTYPES BUT I DONT FEEL LIKE THIS PRODUCT DID ANYTHING FOR ME.  IT WAS BLAND AND FELT LIKE LOTION ON MY FACE UGGGH</li>
    <li> This product works .I noticed less breakout and also my skin is more clear and radiant.But its little bit strong because of glycolic acid ..</li>
    <li> this is the best for the price - glycolic cleanser out there! and amazon keeps it affordable! I have even started using more Marini products thanks to how wonderful this cleanser is.</li>
    <li> Love the price.... I was introduced to it  at a fancy salon and paid way more.  Great product too.</li>
    <li> Like the product alot I had dry skin and it really is a nice product to have and share with others</li>
    <li> It is just ok. I am not sure how much of Glycolic Acid concentration it has, but it feels too mild. It feels like a face wash that has lotion in it. It takes forever to rinse my face because of the slimy texture. After each wash, my eyes feels gluey and blur. It doesn&#x27;t make my face too dry between wash and applying face cream. It will be sitting there as a back up. I am going back to my Peter Thomas glycolic face wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jan Marini since I was 14. I&#x27;m 30 now and it still suits my skin. I have tried changing to less pricey brands but I always end up with breakouts so I come back to Jan Marini. It&#x27;s definitely worth the investment! I have sensitive and acneic skin with a touch of rosacea. All of the Jan Marini products are wonderful.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now.  I was skeptical to purchase because of other reviewers&#x27; claims that it stings, is irritating and drying.  I&#x27;m glad I gave this a shot!  My skin is very oily.  It&#x27;s also very (annoyingly) sensitive and prone to breakouts. I&#x27;ve used just about all cleansing products out there; Purpose, Cetaphil, CeraVe (both foaming and hydrating for summer and winter, respectively), Simple, Oil of Olay, Nubian Heritage Black Soap...the list goes on and on.  Out of all those, the one that worked best was CeraVe, but the cleansing is still a little on the mild side and a little drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Bioglycolic cleanser has worked wonders for me.  It is my belief that the reason why this cleanser is to be applied on dry skin only is because it literally dissolves any oil and impurities on the skin so that skin is left feeling clean and incredibly soft.  It stung lightly a couple of times at first and I think it was because I had a couple of breakouts at that time.  Now that I don&#x27;t have any pimples, I don&#x27;t feel any uncomfortable sensations on my face. You&#x27;re then supposed to wipe off the cleanser with a clean, wrung out soft towel.  I use a white wash towel.  Every time I wash my face after coming home from work or just outside, all the dirt and impurities that accumulate on my face throughout the day are left behind on the towel.  I can honestly say no other cleanser has ever done for my skin what this one has in the little time I&#x27;ve been using it.  Worried that it might be a little over drying as other people have said, I always followed with a mix of my regular moisturizer (Neutrogena Visibly Even) and a drop or two of jojoba oil (based on the wonders people have sworn this oil does to the skin).  I found that my skin got irritated and would break out with this combination.  So I decided to stop using the jojoba oil.  My skin stopped breaking out but it was still too oily.  I noticed that the Neutrogena moisturizer isn&#x27;t oil-free, so I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s the reason.  I stopped using the moisturizer altogether (except when I go out and expect to be under the sun for a long time).  This has worked out wonderfully for me, so far.  I must say, I am a little worried this decision might come back to haunt me as my dermatologist always said it is crucial to use a moisturizer to keep skin moisture levels balanced and help prevent over drying.  But so far, so good.  I haven&#x27;t had one pimple yet on my face and haven&#x27;t felt any stinging or tight sensations on my face.  I guess the less products I use, the happier my face is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a fake product. I&#x27;ve bought this Jan Marini face wash from a spa before and this one is nothing like it. The one I received was much more watery, smelled like chemicals unlike the one I had previously, had a different color cap and stung my skin. It cost less than the one I bought before but it&#x27;s useless. I will never buy from this store again.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..been the best facial cleaner I have ever found</li>
    <li> This product, when used along with some others in a strict daily regimen are the ONLY things that have worked to clear my daughter&#x27;s acne.  Before this she tried going to dermatologists, who prescribed antibiotics (worked but really bad side effects) tried rosacea treatments, using the Clarisonic brush, the blue light therapy, Murad, Proactiv, tea tree, lavender and other essential oils,  more products than I can count.  Nothing else worked. The regimen, prescribed by her aesthetician with FacesPlus, has finally worked.  It&#x27;s taken 4 months, with some set-backs, but she&#x27;s finally clear and it&#x27;s made a world of difference in her life.    This product by itself won&#x27;t be enough.  She also used the Mandelic salicylic serum, soothing cranberry cream, a good sunscreen, and used ice on breakouts daily (reduces inflammation) plus really carefully checking ingredients in makeup and other products to make sure they don&#x27;t contain comedogenic products. She now uses mineral makeup which is less clogging to the pores.  The diet is also important, reducing salt intake and other things.  The aesthetician was an important part of the process. So, I&#x27;m not saying the Jan Marini by itself will be a miracle cure, but it&#x27;s been an important part of the whole regimen.</li>
    <li> Thanks again! Great stuff</li>
    <li> Love the Facial Cleanser, it has improved my skin more than expected.&lt;br /&gt;I told all my friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy for sure again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product line &amp; I love the glycolic wash. Helps with breakout control &amp; keeping the skin more fresh. I am able to use twice daily but sometimes have to cut back a little if sensitive. It is a strong product, considering not prescription strength.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love both the scent of this product and the results.  I&#x27;ve just started using it and combine it with the anti aging cream. You only need a little bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product from Amazon since 2010 and this version is CRAP!  It is thin and watery, with an off-odor, and stings my skin. Anyone who says otherwise has either not used the real thing or is writing a fake review.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year now and it iis a great cleanser for aging skin, keeps skin smooth and soft without drying it out</li>
    <li> I give this one star ONLY because this could be fake.  I bought this product from a skincare website but I thought I would try buying it from Amazon because it was cheaper.  However, it didn&#x27;t feel the same as the previous ones I used and the pump color was different -- white instead of grey.  I read similar reviews about other skincare products.  Amazon may consider doing some QA auditing of skincare/make-up products.  I am back to buying it from the other website because I really like this product.  My pores are visibly smaller after daily use and I have seen less breakouts.</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser and I have somewhat dry skin.  I also get good results applying the cleanser to dry skin and letting it sit for a while before rinsing.  I think it could be used with all skin types</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and decided to try something different then the usual drugstore face washes. So far I think it is helping my skin. It burns a little bit when using it but it stops once you rinse it off. It does not overly dry your skin. Does a good job of removing makeup. I will probably buy it again when it runs out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years. It&#x27;s one of the few products that keeps my cystic acne under control.</li>
    <li> I came into using this product mid 20s but I so wish I would have known about this earlier.  My acne was never full-face problem; my acne was BIG zits, ones that you couldn&#x27;t avoid staring out.  But they were multiple places on my face.  This product was a LIFE-CHANGER.  It has increased my skin quality by 1,000!  I use it everyday religiously and wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.  I saw results in just a week of first using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommened this product to all teens dealing with embarassing acne issues.  Please be sure to read the bottle before using, though; the key to this face wash is to be applied to DRY SKIN.  I guarantee it won&#x27;t have the same effects if used wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE JAN MARINI!</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps breakouts at bay. I use once or twice a week at most since it can dry out your skin of used too often.</li>
    <li> My wife works in the fashion industry and loves this cleanser and will use nothing else.</li>
    <li> The quality was not what I expected. I think the product was watered down, compared to what I previously ordered. Not sure if I will order again.</li>
    <li> I tried pretty much every off the shelf item you can think and nothing gave me any results for my acne. I finally decided to go to a dermatologist and esthetician and they put me on a routine with several different Jan Marini products and the results were better than I could have ever expected. This was several years ago and it still works as long as I use everything twice a day. It&#x27;s a bit of a hassle to apply all of the products and they definitely cost more than the stuff you can get at a CVS, but they have definitely improved my appearance and self-confidence and that&#x27;s worth the price to me.</li>
    <li> If you have mild to moderate acne, this is all you will ever need! I have occasional pimples and sensitive skin - this works for both!</li>
    <li> As far as I can tell, this product allows for a good cleaning. I used it nearly seven years ago n loved it, now it just seems ok.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. Great product, very effective.  Been using this for years.  It keeps my acne at bay without drying out my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the product, the only thing I noticed it dries my skin after use. I had done my research prior to purchase. I like the fact that it has bioglycolic ingredient. You have to apply little bit more face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleansing and refreshing the skin.  I love it!  Gives the face a fresh, bright look and softens that is lovely.</li>
    <li> I sleep with this on my face after I wash it. Once you get over the initial sting it goes away quickly. It has helped tremendously with my acne using it this way. I will continue using this product forever.</li>
</ol>
