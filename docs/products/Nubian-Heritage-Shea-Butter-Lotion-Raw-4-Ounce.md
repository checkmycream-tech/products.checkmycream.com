      <li>fantastic  </li>
      <li>Fantastic smell and quality Shea butter.</li>
      <li>Scrape some out and warm it in your hands (it will melt), rub it on areas that need soothing and or intense moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 months now and it has remained smooth.</li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff.  </li>
      <li>Hope they never stop making it with this fabulous scent.</li>
      <li>It also smells fabulous  too .works</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works great and is natural. I use it on my hair and will never go back to chemical equivalents. My husband used it on eczema on his face that he&#x27;s had for a while and it cleared up almost instantly. Bought it for my mom who loves it as well. Excellent for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I like it but something in it made blemishes on my face...it is good for hands and feet and smells wonderful, but only Mary Kay does not make my face break out. Sorry... But I have to say mixed with baking soda totally gets rid of bad BO...this Nubian Shea butter makes the best homemade organic deodorant !</li>
    <li> Like the shea butter. Like to mix it with my essential oils.</li>
    <li> Great quality shea butter and smells great, too.  it&#x27;s not overpowering. I put it on after a shower and do just a light layer to face at bedtime. I&#x27;m usually the one that breaks out easily this has not been a problem when used sparingly. Order shipped quickly, too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer but it smells like rancid oil. I bought the same fragrance in a candle, soap and body lotion and they all smelled wonderful. I was very disappointed in the smell</li>
    <li> Fantastic smell and quality Shea butter. Pale white and is creamy.  Melts easily and I use it as a night cream. Does not clog pores and skin is soft and smooth. I use in conjunction with rosehip seed oil</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling and feeling shea butter I have ever used.  I use it everywhere, my hair, my legs, my arms - throughout the day at work.  It&#x27;s a long lasting smell that&#x27;s not overpowering and melts in the palm of your hand.  It feels good on the ends of my hair and makes it feel healthier.  I am now purchasing the lotion for to use when I get out of the tub and just to have on hand since I will be leaving the shea butter cream at work.  Again, I love it and urge you to purchase it, I think you will buy more since the smell and the feel has sold me completely.</li>
    <li> This is a super awesome product.  Bought for my mom who constantly struggles with dry skin.  It smells heavenly.  Bought another one for my sis who also fell in love with the product!</li>
    <li> Truely a solution to dry skin ... and so smoooooth ... and non-treasy.</li>
    <li> This is the best shea butter I have tried, it is excellent as a hand cream and I am SO glad I purchased 2. It is a relatively thick cream, so a little goes a long way. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to decide what to call this---I think of &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34; as a creamy, whipped type lotion---this is a block in a jar.&lt;br /&gt; I blow my hair dryer on it to melt it a little so I can get it out and it will spread easily&lt;br /&gt;That being said, i love it. It is a great moisturizer and smells GREAT!</li>
    <li> Really works to soften your skin  It also smells fabulous  too .works fantastic  especially  the heels of your poor feet</li>
    <li> This creme is so healing and moisturizes skin like nothing else but...&lt;br /&gt;even better is:&lt;br /&gt;This is a hard creme, like a stick of butter in a tub.  I scrape out about a half a dime size and rub it around in palm until it melts, then I put about a half a dollar size of some good non-fragrant creme like a hypo-allergenic one and rub together.  The raw shea butter myrrh\frankinsence fragrance is so wonderful but strong that with the added neutral creme I am able to use that small amount to cover my feet, legs, arms and hands.  Crawl in the sheets and your bed smells divine.  Put on in the morning and your clothes and shoes have that faint delicious smell.  Let it be your special trademark aroma and don&#x27;t wear any cologne---the men love that clean fresh smell and your co-workers won&#x27;t gag behind your back from your perfume.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to think because all the reviews make it sound like this I product should be the consistency of body butter, which should be very smooth and creamy. Mine arrived on one of the coldest days of the year and the carrier left the package on our porch porch. It was about 35 degrees and was there a couple of hours. When I opened the jar I assumed there was a wax sealant on top because it was as hard as rock. I waited until the butter was room temperature and it softened up a little but it very gritty and has the consistency of Malto meal or cornbread batter. I do not feel like it does the job because instead of rubbing into my skin, I have to deal with little pieces of gritty residue coming off all over everything. I am fairly sure this happened because the butter was subjected to extreme temperature changes. I think it should be a different consistency, so I guess I am going to have to return it.&lt;br /&gt;Revised January 13, 2015&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to contact the distributor of this product to find out if the grainy texture could be attributed to the fact that it arrived frozen. They told me to refer my comments to Amazon because the order was fulfilled by them. So I will be returning it because it doesn&#x27;t perform the way a body butter should. A word to the wise, don&#x27;t order this item during times of extreme temperature changes because they don&#x27;t pack it in a way that it is protected from the elements. I read in another review that it arrived melted and seeping out of the container!&lt;br /&gt;Attempted to relate as two stars... But system would not let me.</li>
    <li> I first jar i purchased was perfect. It smelled great and it dissolved in my hands by rubbing them together. The second jar i purchased (2 weeks later) had no scent other than that of natural shea butter and the butter was very gritty to the point that it didn&#x27;t dissolve in my hands nor on my body as i applied it. It leaves my body feeling gritty. Since the formula is not consistant, i will not order this again unless i start seeing more positive reviews.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product several times and usually love it. But this batch smells horrible and it&#x27;s white and it&#x27;s usually a yellow color but anyway I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again. Very disappointed!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this product and have ordered it multiple times. It&#x27;s thick and great to use overnight on my hands and feet. It does take some time to sink in, so it&#x27;s probably not good to use as a daily lotion.</li>
    <li> Love love love raw Shea butter. Unfortunately the only place I can buy it is off of amazon! Winter is so harsh on mine and my kids hair this stuff is a life saver.</li>
    <li> Healed my winter hands and legs. I swear by this stuff now.&lt;br /&gt;This did separate like other reviewers noted. I just took it out and mixed it well then back in the tub it went. If It happened again I would warm tub in warm water then mix in tub.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell too hippy or patchouli ish. Warm and earthy though.</li>
    <li> very nice smell and works great</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. Its thick natural and raw. I love the fragrance of the Frankincense and myrrh. I use it daily. I definitely recommend this natural product to anyone who wants soft beautiful skin or soft beautiful  hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I put it on my face under my makeup and my face is instantly smooth. Put it on at night for a night cream and my face looks refreshed in the morning. I don&#x27;t know the longterm effect, but I am impressed after just using it three times.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to keep my 75 year old skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;I will certainly buy again.</li>
    <li> this is really intense stuff..I only use it now at night when I can wear pj&#x27;s that cover my skin..it will eventually soak in, but I don&#x27;t suggest you use it during the day with dresses or shorts. Gets on everything..doesn&#x27;t rub all the way in skin when you first put it on. But your skin is so soft when it finally does. The smell is fabulous, as I have a lot of other hair products with this scent. You will have soft skin, which is what you are going after if you buy shea butter.</li>
    <li> My wife and I use this.  It smells nice and it is very useful.  It may be a little greasy for some, but, she a butter is that way.  Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these. Although they were wrapped in plastic, both had melted out of the containers and rehardened. I tried using one, but I didn&#x27;t like the smell or the way it felt. I&#x27;ve used raw Shea Butter before, so I don&#x27;t know if it was because it had melted where ever it was being stored.</li>
    <li> I like this butter, but it&#x27;s hard like a wax. You really need to scrape it out of the canister, or perhaps heat it up to soften it? Anyway, once I smooth it on, it works well. I love shea butter products, and this is very nice. And smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> This makes my hair so soft. I use it on my body as well. smells nice too. You don&#x27;t even have to use a lot at once.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really thick -- the consistency and color of a good quality ghee.  Scrape some out and warm it in your hands (it will melt), rub it on areas that need soothing and or intense moisturizing.  Although it seems greasy at first, it does rub in -- just keep massaging.  Fantastic stuff.  I use it on mild red bumps that I get on the backs of my 47 year old upper arms.  When I use it regularly, the bumps are gone.  When I miss a few days, they come back.  Really soften skins.  Just amazing, and I love the scent.  Possibly those who said it stank, got a bad batch.  This stuff is so much like butter, I can see how it could go bad.</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 2 stars because it turns rancid so quickly. It smells divine and love it but by the time it is half empty it turns rancid.  I now buy the shea moisture which never turns rancid and I like it even more.</li>
    <li> This is great for as a lotion. We put it on after bathing. It handles dry skin and rough feet (from working out) really well.</li>
    <li> I love these products. I never thought I would like the Frankencense &amp; Myrrh fragrance, but I LOVE IT!!! :-)</li>
    <li> I can put this on my face and I don&#x27;t break out. Lovely scent. Hard as a rock but you can scrape out and rub with your hand. I use it on my face and it has been wonderful in this winter weather. Did not clog my pores. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I purchased the Nubian brand by mistake after trying a similar product at a friend&#x27;s house. Unlike the Shea Moisture brand, this product required me to scrap some off by digging my nail into it for the first several uses and the aroma isn&#x27;t nearly as appealing as the Shea Moisture brand either.  Compared to the Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter, this fails greatly so I have returned it and ordered the other brand instead.</li>
    <li> i really like this product and it smells wonderful, my only issue is it&#x27;s hard as a rock and takes a lot of work to melt it and absorb into the skin. once it finally does melt and absorb it&#x27;s super moisturizing and makes your skin feel hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard and doesn&#x27;t spread well.  Lotion was better.</li>
    <li> The best healing shea butter out there. Brilliant stuff!</li>
    <li> The raw shea butter looked white and dry all the way through but surprised me.  It is very rich and thick, like cold butter out of the fridge.  However, when you put it in your hand it melts like butter.</li>
    <li> This winter has been brutal and with me constantly washing my hands on the job doesn&#x27;t help.  This has been a hand savior.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer and skin repair, if dry rough skin, I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Probably the best pure, and organic shea butter I&#x27;ve ever come across.  Has a light shea butter scent as it has been infused with Frankincense and Myrrh, therefore it doesn&#x27;t have the typical fishy raw shea butter scent. It is yellow, and has a smooth consistency. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 months now and it has remained smooth. It easily melts in between the hands when rubbed together. I use mine sparingly, as a sealer in my hair (after moisturizing).  I&#x27;ve also used it on my skin after showering and it absorbs quickly and lightly- not leaving my skin greasy or feeling over-heated. I will definitely buy again when my product is finished.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift.  It is something she has had before and really loves.</li>
    <li> Love it, but it costs way too much - cheaper to buy a pound of unrefined shea butter and add your own scent to it.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing but the scent has a weird \\&quot;after smell\\&quot; after the initial yummy smell subsides... will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> WARNING!!! DANGER THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS SOY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the ingredient description I found at several web sites:&lt;br /&gt;The Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter Collection are recipes of essential vitamins, skin and hair-nourishing ingredients, including Vitamins E and B-5, Soy Milk, Jojoba Oil, Cocoa Butter, and Macadamia Seed Oil. The unique formulas are infused with a special essential oil blend of Frankincense, Myrrh,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on the product lists only lists Shea frankincense, myrrh, vitamin E, and essential oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would never rub peanut butter on a child allergic to peanuts. The reason you can no longer get peanuts on planes is that people can develop anaphylaxis from inhaling the dust from peanuts and die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soy is among the nine most common food allergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hypersensitivity to dietary substances from soy causing an overreaction of the immune system which may lead to severe physical symptoms for millions of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most severe food allergy reaction is called anaphylaxis and is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention and treatment with Epinephrine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am shocked that Amazon does not require companies to list potentially deadly ingredients and inform customers of such a dangerous ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed a skin rash on my arms and legs where I had spread this cream. On areas where the skin was broken (a scrap and bug bits) my skin became swollen and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep Epinephrine with me at all times do to my soy allergy and would never have purchased this product had I known it contained soy protein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soy has proteins in common with peanuts so people with peanut allergies as well as soy reactions need to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband never eats soy because of my allergy. If my husband kissed my neck and then kissed my lips I could have experienced anaphylaxis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first episode of anaphylaxis nearly ended my life. The treatment for my last episode of anaphylaxis left me with permanent heart damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a right to know I am exposing myself to such a potentially dangerous ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did call Nubian Heritage at 631-842-8800 and reached an answering machine with the message \\&quot;there is not enough room to record any more messages\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My internet research said the Founder is Richelieu Dennis and they appear to be a very small operation out of Amityville NY. The Nubian Heritage company should not be allowed to advertise on Amazon&#x27;s web site.</li>
    <li> love it the smell is amazing my skin is very soft to the touch</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product.  Have a large scar on my face due to skin cancer surgery.  This product is not only helping with the scarring but providing much needed relief from the discomfort of the healing.  The fragrance is also very soothing.  Definitely will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff but also very expensive. Pure shea butter is available much cheaper,. Don&#x27;t pay for the name brand, look for no name shea butter and save. This is great stuff if you don&#x27;t mind spending the money.</li>
    <li> It nourishes the skin and smell good, too. I have skin sensitivities to certain frangrances and it didn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> This butter is perfect for my skin. I have Sjogrin&#x27;s Syndrome and my body is dry. The buter is great for moisture and it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing.</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin soooooooo soft.</li>
    <li> Wonderfully exquisite!!!!  The scent is truly heavenly like the body bar.  You will truly enjoy it and will never go back to anything other than Shea butter.  I use both this item and Shea mixed with goats milk from the same supplier (Nubian).  They are truly heaven scent!  It bathes the skin of a Native American with love! :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. It works wonders for my skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Raw Unrefined Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;Nubian Heritage is great stuff except I don&#x27;t care for the scent.&lt;br /&gt;The nutty/earthy scent from the Shea is still predominant.&lt;br /&gt;I only use it when I&#x27;m not going out in public.</li>
    <li> Did not know that I was going to need a hair dryer to soften this stuff up. Great dry skin relief. Just wish I had known that this stuff is solid as a rock.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve ordered 2 jars of this stuff in the past 2 weeks. it smells great. it feels great (not greasy). and the price is great. i&#x27;ve tried other creamy textured shea butters but this one is amazing. and a little bit does go a long way. these 2 jars will probably last me the next 4 months!</li>
    <li> I use Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter all over my body daily to moisturize my skin.  Its great!</li>
    <li> this is a very good product i like it very much</li>
    <li> This makes your hands feel so soft and his has a light scent to it. Very nice to have. I will buy this again</li>
    <li> Works great for eczema.</li>
    <li> I returned this product because it did not smell fresh like an exact other jar of this product I received as a gift.  I returned two and I am being told I am only receiving a refund for one.  I do not  understand.</li>
    <li> I used to use L’Oreal products even though their ingredients list read like a science fair. After switching to Nubian Heritage Raw Shea Butter my skin is clearer and less irritated! I have no complaints about any of Nubian Heritage’s products except that I wished I found them sooner!</li>
    <li> Great product and love the scent!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smells really good.</li>
    <li> I am  truly disappointed in this product.&lt;br /&gt;This butter smells awful. I am NOT exaggerating: this actually smells fishy. I had no choice but to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;Now: maybe it is just the batch that I got, but I don&#x27;t think so: I found another review describing the same smelly phenomenon on the web. I hope that Nubian looks into this matter as soon as possible, in order to correct it.&lt;br /&gt;This is not acceptable.</li>
    <li> This is the second jar of this product I have ordered.  It softens my skin like no other product!!  The scent is nice and fresh.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I always use this product, but I used to buy it from my local Walmart. It&#x27;s a dollar or so cheaper there, but it is very unreliably stocked. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in two months!! This got to my door in two days, I&#x27;ll pay a dollar for the convenience!!</li>
    <li> Great Stuff- good for the dry air in Colorado.  Those in more humid areas may find it too greasy, but my skin loves this product.</li>
    <li> This smells simply delicious, I was planning on buying frankincense oil by itself for my scars, but I ended up getting some rosehip oil (no verdict on that yet), and I got this little jar of gold. It&#x27;s a small jar but the product spreads so well on my skin, and it makes my skin feel really soft. As for scars, cocoa butter has been working but REALLY slowly, that&#x27;s why I bought this since frankincense is well known for its skin regenerative properties. Loving the organic goodies I&#x27;ve been buying off Amazon lately. I totally recommend Nubian Heritage soaps as well, my dry skin feels great with their products.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mom for christmas. Very nice scent. Not overwhelming. Nice and soft whipped shea butter. Very smooth. Pretty much exactly what I wanted. Doesn&#x27;t smell at all like shea butter, just a light sweet frankincense and myrrh scent.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, the feel and the results of this shea.  I buy it from swanson vitamins because they are cheaper and use the shea, the lotion and the soap- (will soon try the body wash).  I credit this as helping to clear my almost 1 year old&#x27;s baby winter ezcema and he smells so good everyone always comments on it.  Love this company!</li>
    <li> I have neuropathy and this product used to be great for my feet with the burning and dry skin, plus it smelled great too. I noticed something VERY wrong with this latest order and it seems they no longer make it themselves. Whoever does- it&#x27;s nasty smelling like some chemical, the rich gold color paled into ghastly white, thinner consistency and in general unuseable- I actually washed it off my foot. So sad to see this happen. If you look at the old container to the new, the old one states they make it themselves- the new one has removed that statement and even the top lid has some redesigns. Shame. I&#x27;m sure they are saving money by outsourcing but they&#x27;ve lost sales from this customer. I&#x27;ve posted the original vs new so people can see in case they run across a good batch somewhere still out there. I&#x27;ll be scouring my local stores today.</li>
    <li> It is not as creamy as I thought but feels great on my skin.  I apply it every evening before bed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best skin product I&#x27;ve ever bought - you can use it everywhere, from dry feet to face and lips. I even dab a bit on my hair to reduce frizz sometimes. When traveling and I want to pack light, it&#x27;s practically the only cosmetic product I bring! Hope they never stop making it with this fabulous scent.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! And really softens weather worn skin.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  It is the best.</li>
    <li> Great products. Arrived with other two similar products ordered at same time. at least 2 of the 3 products leaked. I&#x27;m still happy--wasn&#x27;t too terribly messy and not too much product loss--but would like to see seller use extra precautions when shipping these, especially to a hot climate like Texas where product expands in heat.</li>
    <li> Both jars had leaked inside their sealed bags during shipping, so they were filmed in a layer of cream when I opened the packages- Amazon box had an oil stain inside. I was a bit annoyed, but I called hubby into the kitchen, told him to take his sandals off and I cleaned the jars off by transferring the leaked cream to his feet, then massaging it in. Needless to say, he was happy and I was happy not to waste one bit of this outrageously wonderful stuff. The fragrance is lovely and the cream is so moisturizing. If I have applied it to my skin and then I take a shower hours later (with body wash), water still beads up on my skin. That&#x27;s protection. Would have given 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to do the foot rub bit. Excellent pricing, I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> Nubian Heritage Shea Butter is wonderful! Using it in the dry Chicago winter has kept my body supple and shiny. Even if you miss a day, the moisturizer is still working. The Frankincense and Myrrh is a bit masculine or musky (may use a different fragrance) but the smell is exotic! Truly, this is a great product for the health of your skin.</li>
