      <li>I always loved the classic Herbacin hand cream.  </li>
      <li>and it worked pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly!</li>
      <li>I NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE AND RECEIVED ONE AS A FREE SAMPLE.  </li>
      <li>where it is a few buck cheaper but bear in mind shipping costs too for the best deal.</li>
      <li>AND HAS A LIGHT CLEAN SCENT.  </li>
      <li>Success!  </li>
      <li>First introduced to it ages ago in Europe, we are glad it can now be had in the states.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, soaks in nicely, isn&#x27;t sticky, leaves hands soft and silky.</li>
      <li>My favorite part is that it&#x27;s very concentrated</li>
      <li>I love it so much.</li>
      <li>It smells fabulous and really softens your skin!</li>
      <li>She was very pleased with this product, and I will definitely be getting her another order soon.  </li>
      <li>If you liked the old Pacquins brand that&#x27;s not made anymore, this is the most similar item  my sisters</li>
      <li>No greasy mess, nice smooth healing hands with a clean scent.  </li>
      <li>It is quite sticky at first, but that goes away after a minute.</li>
      <li>I have been using this hand cream for many years and used to purchase it at a local store.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s exactly what i was expecting, very moisturizing, not greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>Most lotions dry up a couple minutes after you put it on, but this lotion stays on your hands and you feel like you have lotion on.</li>
      <li>Has a slight fragrance, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>Another great thing, I wash my hands often throughout the day and this takes a few washes to come off, which I personally like.</li>
      <li>If I put this on at bed time, they are much improved by morning.</li>
      <li>My cat really can&#x27;t stand the scent of creams.</li>
      <li>If it really had no scent I&#x27;d give it another star.  </li>
      <li>Not greasy or oily, feels like real skin.</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion and don&#x27;t notice any overpowering scent.</li>
      <li>This cream also works very well on cracked heels.</li>
      <li>I had some very deep cracks in my heels that other products that are designed for cracked heels, and hadn&#x27;t done a bit of good.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The classic one is very moisturizing and makes your hands really soft.  </li>
      <li>Then, about two years ago the beauty supply store where I normally bought it stopped carrying it.</li>
      <li>Absorbs into your skin quickly, non-greasy, and protects your hands all day long.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s almost exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>Any time I need a little something to get the free shipping, I can throw one or two of these into the order.</li>
      <li>After using this product my hands feel soft, and never greasy.</li>
      <li>It has a soft and silky texture and keeps my hands very moisturized even in the very dry winter air.</li>
      <li>I crochet almost daily, and the yarns draws the natural moisture from my hands.</li>
      <li>I tried other products, but nothing helped my dry hands as much or as quickly.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend if you have extremely dry skin.</li>
      <li>I was a bit disappointed as it&#x27;s not as good as the classic one.  </li>
      <li>The first tube was packaged so tightly into the envelope (and we had temps well below zero)</li>
      <li>AND IT KEEPS HANDS SOFT FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a little hard for me to use some of these things as I am more sensory</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this hand cream for several years. Then, about two years ago the beauty supply store where I normally bought it stopped carrying it. I tried other products, but nothing helped my dry hands as much or as quickly. I wash my hands a lot, and especially in winter my hands pay a big price. If I put this on at bed time, they are much improved by morning. So glad I found my favorite brand at Amazon. Any time I need a little something to get the free shipping, I can throw one or two of these into the order.</li>
    <li> I always loved the classic Herbacin hand cream.  However, I bought this one this time to try it out.  I was a bit disappointed as it&#x27;s not as good as the classic one.  The classic one is very moisturizing and makes your hands really soft.  This one is less so.</li>
    <li> I lived in Germany for many years and have used it for 20+ years!&lt;br /&gt;This hand cream is so good, I used it on my face!&lt;br /&gt;I have been a lifeguard for over 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;The Glycerine in this product has protected my skin from dark spots &amp; wrinkles !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since moving back state side, I always had my german friend send this product to me because I couldn&#x27;t find it&lt;br /&gt;any where in stores in the US. I have finally found my wonderful product here on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;I will never be without my hand cream again!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CREME!  I NEVER HEARD OF IT BEFORE AND RECEIVED ONE AS A FREE SAMPLE.  EVER SINCE THEN I HAD TO GET MORE.  THIS STUFF WORKS AND HAS A LIGHT CLEAN SCENT.  AND IT KEEPS HANDS SOFT FOR A LONG TIME.</li>
    <li> Wish I could get this locally....not greasy, not heavily scented, perfect hand lotion.</li>
    <li> Good product compared to its price. I will consider buying it again. It is suitable for hands with wrinkles. Also good for whoever love or have to wash hands for too many times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good cream but I wish it had no scent.  If it really had no scent I&#x27;d give it another star.  My cat really can&#x27;t stand the scent of creams.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hand cream for many years and used to purchase it at a local store.  They stopped carrying it and I was happy to find it on Amazon.  It is the best hand cream I have ever used - keeps your hands soft and provides a protective barrier to keep moisture in.  Great stuff!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have another brand of Kamille hand cream that can only be purchased in Europe I&#x27;m told.  It works so well with my mild psoriasis on my hands and has a very nice clean scent.  I was thrilled to test this product out and it&#x27;s almost exactly the same.  Love it!  No greasy mess, nice smooth healing hands with a clean scent.  A little goes a long way so it&#x27;s priced appropriately.  Another great thing, I wash my hands often throughout the day and this takes a few washes to come off, which I personally like.</li>
    <li> I love all glycerine hand creams and this is no exception. It smells fabulous and really softens your skin! My only issue was that I had to purchase it twice. The first tube was packaged so tightly into the envelope (and we had temps well below zero) that when I tore (with my hands, no scissors!) open the envelope the tube tore with it &amp; the entire tube exploded. I think this was because the shipper packed it into the smallest possible envelope to send it out.</li>
    <li> If you liked the old Pacquins brand that&#x27;s not made anymore, this is the most similar item  my sisters and I have found. Close,  but not identical. Not greasy or oily, feels like real skin. I think it&#x27;s the glycerin.</li>
    <li> I keep this in my bathroom next to my sink so after I wash my hands I can put on this lotion (It&#x27;s the only way to remember to put it on multiple times a day) It goes on smooth, soaks in nicely, isn&#x27;t sticky, leaves hands soft and silky. My favorite part is that it&#x27;s very concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I also have very dry skin so I double it as a morning face cream after my shower. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it keeps my face moisturized all day!&lt;br /&gt;2 in 1 product use - AMAZING!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Will use it for the rest of my life. Its the only lotion that doesn&#x27;t burn on my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Gentile scent, not greasy or sticky.  Really nourishing in cold weather.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s exactly what i was expecting, very moisturizing, not greasy at all.  my second tube of herbacin kamille,  love it!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Has a slight fragrance, but it&#x27;s nice. After using this product my hands feel soft, and never greasy.</li>
    <li> Best hand cream I have EVER used.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff! It absorbs quickly! Is not greasy and lasts a long time + it has a very subtle scent that even my husband doesn&#x27;t mind.  First introduced to it ages ago in Europe, we are glad it can now be had in the states.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to comparison shop check out drugstore dot com where it is a few buck cheaper but bear in mind shipping costs too for the best deal.</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot and it worked pretty nicely. It&#x27;s just a little hard for me to use some of these things as I am more sensory and I felt the need to wash my hands immediately after applying the lotion. I didn&#x27;t though, and am satisfied with the results.</li>
    <li> Goes on well but was disappointed in the lack of moisturizing....was hoping for better.</li>
    <li> This product is the best hand lotion on the market.  I&#x27;ve have never been able to find anything that even comes close. Most lotions dry up a couple minutes after you put it on, but this lotion stays on your hands and you feel like you have lotion on.</li>
    <li> It is suitable for me, but not the price advantage.</li>
    <li> I crochet almost daily, and the yarns draws the natural moisture from my hands. Since I&#x27;ve started using this hand cream after I&#x27;m done working, my skin doesn&#x27;t get as rough as it usually does. It is quite sticky at first, but that goes away after a minute. This cream also works very well on cracked heels. I had some very deep cracks in my heels that other products that are designed for cracked heels, and hadn&#x27;t done a bit of good. I applied it a little thick, put on clean socks before going to bed nightly for a week, and my heels are almost completely healed. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years. Unfortunately, a few years ago I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I decided to try Amazon and THERE IT WAS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem with very dry cuticles and when I use this hand cream it literally will heal my fingers overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic stuff!!</li>
    <li> Great product! The same as I used to buy from Germany. It has a soft and silky texture and keeps my hands very moisturized even in the very dry winter air.</li>
    <li> I actually do not like lotion at all.&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to winter time though, my hands get so dry that they crack and they hurt so much!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like having a million paper cuts on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;My friend introduced me to this lovely lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I bought three as gifts. It does not wash off very easily and I love that it protects my hands and keeps them moisturized!&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t have to worry about harmful chemicals being in this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hands for about twenty years.  Absorbs into your skin quickly, non-greasy, and protects your hands all day long.</li>
    <li> Love the glycerin ...it soaks into my hands and does not leave that greasy residue you get with regular hand creams.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and this purchase represented a good price value.  We have used this product for years to good effect. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this in a never-ending quest to replicate my mother&#x27;s experience with Pacquins, a discontinued cream.  Success!  She loved this.  It stays in the skin but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.  She was very pleased with this product, and I will definitely be getting her another order soon.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This one is really the best hand cream I have ever used. I highly recommend it. I love it so much.</li>
    <li> I have been using some hand creams that are medicated for especially dry skin, but when I apply them my hands are shiny and a bit greasy and I have to wait to do anything until it absorbs.  With this Herbacin Kamille hand cream, I can apply it and keep doing what I was doing.  No greasy feeling on my hands, and they are much more moisturized.  I really like this lotion and don&#x27;t notice any overpowering scent. I would highly recommend if you have extremely dry skin.</li>
