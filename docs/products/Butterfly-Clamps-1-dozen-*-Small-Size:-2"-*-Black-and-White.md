      <li>I&#x27;ve used similar clips in the past that were made of more durable plastic, these just don&#x27;t hold up that well.  </li>

    <li> Definitely what I got them for. I knew they wouldn&#x27;t be perfect because they were cheap. For the price, they do the job. If I was spending more than $5 bucks for them, I would be pissed.</li>

    <li> It holds my hair back when I&#x27;m trimming it. It does it&#x27;s job and I have no real problem with it at all.</li>
    <li> I know there are great clips for your hair out there. These however are so great I have used them for over 12 years. (Not the same clips just the same style clips) They are not only cheap but don&#x27;t leave those awful clip marks in your hair.</li>
    <li> Came on time as was what it was advertised to be. Good for the purpose it was purchased for. Would recommend it.</li>

    <li> The size of the clips was what I was looking for. However, I have fine hair so the clips don&#x27;t always stay in place.

You get enough clamps and price is right.</li>
    <li> Great for really long hair.</li>

    <li> These clamps are very cheaply made and on most the sides don&#x27;t even line up. I expect they would okay for coloring hair but that&#x27;s it.</li>
