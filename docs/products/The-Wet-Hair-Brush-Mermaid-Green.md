<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I will never, ever use another brush on my wet hair again.  Loved it so much that I bought some for my friends.  I don&#x27;t struggle with tangles now, thank goodness!</li>
    <li> Highly recommend for use on tangled locks (especially kids)! Works like magic and so glad a stylist told us about this amazing brush.</li>
    <li> If you are brushing your little girl&#x27;s hair with anything else, you need to put it down and purchase a wet brush. Thanks to this product, my little girl no longer cries after shampooing.  What are you waiting for? Stop reading reviews and make this purchase already. :)</li>
    <li> This brush is great for fine hair. Easy to brush through knots and doesn&#x27;t break hair.</li>
    <li> Works miracles on my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very long, think hair.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!! I have very curly hair and have always struggled getting a brush through my hair. This brush glides right through pain free! Where has this been all of my life?!!</li>
    <li> The Wet Brush is what you need for kids with tangled hair!  It brushes out the tangles gently!!</li>
    <li> I am confused about why my old &amp;#34;The Wet Brush&amp;#34; had &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; in the logo, and this new green one only had &amp;#34;Wet Brush&amp;#34; on it.  I don&#x27;t know if this is no big deal,  or one of them is counterfeit, or whatever.  All I know is that this new metallic green one does not work while my hair is wet.  The bristles are way too soft, and it just bends and slicks over my head without much grab on my hair...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this particular version because the other time I ordered these it worked pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;Shark&amp;#34; brand brushes were nice, but didn&#x27;t last long at all before all the bristles broke through the tips. These seem to be more durable in that way.</li>
    <li> Great brush, came as described.</li>
    <li> works really good with wet hair. i use mine all the time</li>
    <li> Works very well however the bristles kept falling out. The one I bought from the hair salon didn&#x27;t do this...</li>
    <li> Painless hair brushing. I have hair down to my hips and it takes at least two pony tails to tame it  because its so thick! You do still have to brush bottom to top with this hairbrush (it&#x27;s not magical!) But it makes life so much easier! Definitely would recommend!</li>
    <li> the brush is very nice when i brush my wet hair it just glides threw no breaking my hair works very well on my grand daughters long hair too</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair at all, wet or dry. It&#x27;s very good at getting tangles out, more so when hair is wet but still good when dry. I have some trouble with dandruff and this brush doesn&#x27;t scratch my scalp at all...it actually feels really nice. So glad I got this one instead of the detangling brush! thinking of getting another to keep in the car. Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I ordered a second one within 2 days of receiving my first! I have tried a few tangle brushes with my daughter who is 7 and has hair down to her bottom - she hated them--- I seen the price and reviews for this brush - thought why not! It&#x27;s an amazing brush tangles are out with the second time through! I have even caught my daughter using this on her own! I do not write reviews I don&#x27;t really care to but I NEEDED to with this product! I am simply amazed - even goes through my hair sprayed hair like butter! THANK YOU!!</li>
    <li> I got this today and it does the job. it&#x27;s awesome. I see people are saying it smell?... It&#x27;s the rubber on the brush. It does not smell. Reason why I have it 4 stars because mine looks like it got beat up. I&#x27;m not gonna return it and ask for a new one because I don&#x27;t care. Lol as long it does the job, that&#x27;s all I care. Thank you!!! :)</li>
    <li> My four years old always wake up with her hair all tangled up. She used to complain and at times cry everytime I brush her hair. But ever since we used this brush she never complained. I was so amazed that every time I brush her hair I ask her does it hurt? And she says no. I would have even five star but it gets four because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the tangle so at the end I do have to go over with regular brush to finish it off.</li>
    <li> Finally! No more chasing naked children around after the bath trying to catch them long enough to take one swipe of the brush at a time, all while they holler and plead for you to just shave their heads already. My eldest daughter is four and has a massive amount of ultra-fine, straight hair and it tangles easily. Even with detangling sprays. My 2 year-old has less hair but is infinitely more dramatic. They will both ONLY let me use this brush, even though the big one called it the \\&quot;stinky brush\\&quot; for three weeks and pretended to gag every time I used it. Now I need to buy another to keep on the main floor. It works great on dry hair, too. I think I&#x27;ll buy one for my uber-corporate yet lushly-headed head-banging brother-in-law, my sister was amazed when she last visited.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for my thin hair! I use it with children&#x27;s spray detangler and it is so easy to brush my hair out now! Even after the beach or pool.</li>
    <li> I understand that this was made in China, and that it is a relatively cheap product, BUT why does it have an awful, awful, awful odor?  It smells like rubber meets chemicals meets burning asphalt.  Absolutely gross.  I washed it, soaked it (for 2 days), and now I&#x27;m &amp;#34;resting&amp;#34; it on some dryer sheets, but still to no avail.</li>
    <li> Great price! The brushes are amazing.  Work great for kids hair with tangles.  It is no longer a fight to brush my girls hair. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> A friend if mine was singing the praises of this brush on social media and I couldn&#x27;t believe how many others were chiming in. Many said it had saved their relationships with their young daughters, which seemed ridiculous. But I have fine hair that looks tangled five minutes after being brushed, so I&#x27;ll try anything. I&#x27;ve done Tangle Teaser and the As Seen On TV brush. Honestly, my friends were underselling it. If I&#x27;d had this as a kid my mother and I really would&#x27;ve gotten along better. Even the worst bedhead doesn&#x27;t hurt to brush out and very few hairs are sacrificed in the process. Also, my hair still looks brushed for hours, if not all day! The only drawback is, now I can&#x27;t stand any of my other brushes as they hurt too much. I just ordered two more. Amazon has great prices.</li>
    <li> My girls love them (Dad does too)!!</li>
    <li> A great brush for a great price!  Works wonderfully, and feels nice on the scalp.  I just purchased another one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how it works, but it does!  We have tried so many brushes for my daughter&#x27;s hair, but none have compared to this one.  I was skeptical ordering it because it looks like an ordinary brush.  However, it works amazing for both wet and dry hair.  Excellent purchase.  Color true to picture.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my two little dogs.  One a ShihTzu and the other a Maltese.  They always hated getting brushed.  But with this brush they now battle on who&#x27;s going to be brushed first.&lt;br /&gt;The brush does not hurt them or pull on their hair.  It does not hurt their skin.  It gets all tangles out.  And I think it gives them a good massage that they enjoy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brush! My hair gets super knotty when I get out of the shower,  and I always have to tear through it to brush it. It&#x27;s painful, and rips alot of hair out. This brush glides right through my hair, doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t rip any out. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so different than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used,  but somehow it is!</li>
    <li> This goes through my hair like a hot knife through butter.  Even my daughter, who hates having her hair brushed, loves it with this one!  I have to get another one for my purse!</li>
    <li> this brush has done wonders for my crazy tangly hair! it makes washing my hair so much easier. i hav bra strap length  - relaxed hair that tangles so easily and i would lose a lot of hair with other combs. they say not to use brushes on wet hair but don&#x27;t be afraid to use this as the bristles are very flexible - nothing like a paddle brush</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing. My girls love it. My middle daughter has very thick long hair and this brush is the only one that can get through the knots. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair but a lot of it (also heavily processed).  It tangles and knots up when it is wet.  When it is dry it is soft and manageable.  When it is wet it is like the swamp thing (Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde).  This brush is the best brush I have ever owned!  It glides through my wet and dry hair and has made knots non-existent.  I think I will grow my hair extra long again because of this brush.  Just get it already.</li>
    <li> We love the first Wet brush we bought but this one is not the same :(&lt;br /&gt;During the first use, 4 bristles came out and it doesn&#x27;t seem to brush through my girls hair well.</li>
    <li> It looks a lot like any brush from the store! Don&#x27;t let it fool you!  It is amazing! I love my Wet Brush!</li>
    <li> First brush I&#x27;ve owned that hasn&#x27;t hurt! Works on my daughters thick curly hair. I love love love this brush!</li>
    <li> OMG...my 9 year old daughter finally has a hairbrush that she will use.  I would have one in every room if it meant she would keep her hair brushed.</li>
    <li> Where have you been for the past 6 years??!!!! My little girl would complain every time o attempted to brush her hair! Now, she brushes it herself!!!!! Love this brush!</li>
    <li> best brush ever.  It&#x27;s magical.</li>
    <li> Superb!. Best detangling brush i ever had.</li>
    <li> This is the first brush that I have been able to use on my daughter&#x27;s hair, with no complaints.  I have a 5 and a 3 year old, and they will sit quietly and let me brush their hair with this. They used to fight every morning because they said the old brush hurt. They love this brush, and so do I!</li>
    <li> Ripped out a lot of my hair</li>
    <li> I love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;  I now own  3 of them.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush thinking that there was no way it could painlessly brush my curly hair while wet. I read all of the great reviews, and thought I would try it since it was so inexpensive. I was pleasantly surprised. I don&#x27;t know what is different about this brush that makes it work, but it works! It really is amazing for people with curly hair.</li>
    <li> It can not hurt to use.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever! I was recommended this brush from my cousin who is a hair stylist. I always have knots in my hair. This brush goes thru my hair so easily. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have thin hair but alot of it and my hair tends to knot up pretty fast. No matter what I do (get a fresh hair cut, condition my hair, brush it throughout the day, etc), nothing seems to keep the knots away. I bought this brush since I had heard good things and after using it, I will say IT DOES WORK. Now, let me note, that it is not totally tangle-free. The brush will still get caught slightly but nowhere near as bad as other brushes I&#x27;ve used. If you brush slowly, it does de-tangle the hair quite nicely.</li>
    <li> Best brush for tangles I have ever found!</li>
    <li> I have girls with a lot of hair, some curly and very easily tangled.  The wet brush works wonders on their hair.  It is the only brush that I can use on my tender-headed one without her crying and screaming.</li>
    <li> What an amazing brush! I went swimming in the lake and my hair was so gross from not combing or washing it for the entire day. I showered and cubed it with the wet brush and i would have never known my hair was a rats nest. Usually I&#x27;m pulling my hair out with brushes/combs after swiing in the lake all day. I would recommend this to anyone especially people with kids that have a sensitive scalp</li>
    <li> Great brush! I got two, one for me and one for my nine year-old daughter. Perhaps someday she&#x27;ll actually use a brush.</li>
    <li> I like this brush ok, but my 8 year old son who I bought it for says it hurts his head. The bristles are a little too pointy for a kid with sensory issues.</li>
    <li> Best brush!  my kids have hair that tangles so easily and it is also very curly.  this brush is the best! it doesn&#x27;t hurt when i brush their hair like the other brushes i have tried.  I also use it on my own hair.</li>
    <li> If your child (or YOU) has tangly hair- BUY THIS BRUSH!  Amazing!  It has changed our lives- no more tears after bath time :)</li>
    <li> Best. Brush. Ever. For curly hair or for straight hair, I love this brush!</li>
    <li> well i bought this brush because my hair was getting very long and i needed to brush a lot of stuff out of my hair because simply shampooing a lot wasnt going to cut it. and my girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like me cutting my hair it feels great against my scalp and it goes through my hair effortlessly</li>
    <li> I have very long, very thick, straight hair...I usually wash it at night, don&#x27;t brush it and let it dry while I sleep.  I saw a commercial for a wet brush on television....looked it up on amazon and found this brush and ordered it.  I used it yesterday, I was able to brush my hair wet, and completely detangle it...I put on my leave on conditioner and brushed it again, when it was dry my hair looked beautiful, smooth and shiny!  I bought 2...one for home and one for purse!</li>
    <li> This brush is a must have for long, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to be flexible, the bristles, but it still caught me off guard. When my hair is dry, I have to slowly brush since my hair is sometimes thick. I haven&#x27;t tried it wet. For wigs, its great!</li>
    <li> My daughter and I love these brushes.</li>
    <li> A friend had this brush and I used it after swimming one day when I forgot my own. It is AMAZING and I scanned Amazon that very day to buy myself one. What a surprise when I saw the low price. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Wet hair, dry hair-  no tangles! Fun green color and soft bristles. I don&#x27;t have any more to say about this brush.</li>
    <li> At school we swim during PE. After my hair is a nightmare! My friend lent me this brush, and it worked WONDERS! I suggest this brush! I LOVE the cool colors!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe I was brushing through my hair wet and dry with no problem. The green is adorable too.</li>
    <li> My nine-year-old daughter loves this brush it&#x27;s saved us from lots of tears .</li>
    <li> When Dona Camaj, who has absolutely gorgeous hair, highly recommended the Wet brush I immediately ordered it on here. I&#x27;m so glad that I did because it is different and it works! I actually brushed half of someones hair with this brush and they brushed the other side with theirs. The Wet brush glided through their super thick hair and the volume was reduced by at least 50%. Their hair had more shine on the Wet brush side as well. Being able to use this on my wet hair, which gets extremely tangled, is probably the most amazing part of this brush. It works better than my Italian combs which are ten times the price of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was concerned that the long, super bendy plastic bristles weren&#x27;t going to get down to the scalp but somehow they totally do. This has become my new favorite brush that yes, would have saved a lot of tears when I was a tender headed little girl. We&#x27;ll see how long it&#x27;ll last but I&#x27;ve been using it over a month now and it still looks brand new and us very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> This brush works great at getting out the tangles...no detangling spray needed at all.  Even though it&#x27;s called the wet brush, it works great on dry hair, too.  My daughters are so happy that I found this!</li>
    <li> This brush is definitely a must for wet hair...dry hair not so well but works great on wet hair, my daughter has curly thick hair and when it&#x27;s wet, this brush glides right through her hair. It worked so well I purchased an extra one. thanks.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. My girls love it</li>
    <li> I saw this brush advertised and thought, sure.  Then a friend on FB said it was great and I thought, okay, I&#x27;ll try it.  I bought it as a gift.  Thick curly hair and this brush goes right through it.  Fantastic brush!</li>
    <li> Great brush  it works much better than a lot of others I&#x27;ve tried. My daughter will only let me use this brush on her hair.</li>
    <li> this brush is great for anyone whose hair gets entangled all the tie and breaks easily when trying to brush it. Especially blondes! ladies, it&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> I was soo excited to get this brush cause I Hate getting my hair done. my head is super sensitive and my hair is Really &amp;#34;nappy&amp;#34; sometimes. It did ease some of the pain but when I tried brushing through the knots in my hair it still hurt. but it&#x27;ll still come in handy especially after i get out of the pool and stuff. if your hair is like mine and really really  &amp;#34;tangly&amp;#34; or hard to tame this brush may not be The best but then again it&#x27;s not that bad. I probably shoulda tried the knot genie......</li>
    <li> Honestly, brushing my daughter&#x27;s hair after a shower is often a miserable experience. She has extremely thick hair with some curl, some wave to it. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to brush when dry, and pretty awful when wet, also. SO, i got this brush. We used it on her dry hair and it was definitely better than anything else we&#x27;ve ever used. Tonight, we got our first trial on her wet hair. OH MY! It went right through as if she had thin, fine hair. It took about two seconds to brush her hair. She was THRILLED, and therefore, of course, so am I. I left her getting her pajamas on so I could run right to the computer to write this review! Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe what a different experience this was compared to what we normally deal with!!</li>
    <li> Best brush I have ever used because it is well made, hopefully -- just started using, and de-tangles hair extremely well.  Looks good too.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that can rip when combed wet. This brush DOES not rip your hair out. My niece has thick hair and it works for her too! This is the best brush! Can&#x27;t beat the price. They sell this brush for double at my local hair salon.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! My daughter has long, thick wavy hair that tangles easily.  This brush makes mornings so much more peaceful.</li>
    <li> Wow! So I have really fine/thin hair that gets tangled like you wouldn&#x27;t believe so I figured I would try the &amp;#34;best brush&amp;#34;. I took a shower, took the towel off my head and as usual my hair was a bird&#x27;s nest! Got my brush out and in seconds my hair was all brushed out! Never felt a thing and there wasn&#x27;t a pile of hair in the brush afterwards! This thing really is the BEST!</li>
    <li> This product works great and happy with my purchase! Would 100% buy again and recommend to anyone looking for a wet brush. It goes through my thick wet hair like it&#x27;s cutting butter.</li>
    <li> My 3 year old daughter has hair down to her backside.  It is also wavy.&lt;br /&gt;With only a little conditioner, this brush gets through all the knots.</li>
    <li> I have long, waivy hair and hated how my old brush would pull &amp; break my hair.  This hairbrush feels good on my scalp, doesn&#x27;t pull on or break my hair, and is so gentle on wet or dry hair.  A great brush!!!</li>
    <li> My hair needs some serious cutting and this gets through my natural hair</li>
    <li> daughter has very, very long hair and always has problems gettting through tangles.  This brush was recommended by hair salon and it really does work so much better and hurts less and helps avoid splittting ends getting through long, wet hair.</li>
    <li> Prefect for detangling my curly hair and my daughter&#x27;s too!</li>
    <li> Great for brushing through my nappy tangles!</li>
    <li> Have long curly hair and this brush is soft to the tough and doesn&#x27;t pull the way some brushs do!!</li>
    <li> So, the general concept of this brush is that the bristle are extremely thin and flexible. This means it won&#x27;t get caught on tangles, instead the bristle will bend and then just slide free of the hair. That&#x27;s convenient for not causing children to fuss while brushing curly or tangly hair, but it also means that it does pretty much nothing to get the tangles out. You can spend all day brushing away with this and still have a head full of tangles unless you use another implement alongside it or get creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For us, it works well when our VERY curly headed curl has her entire head drenched (and I mean an entire adult handful) of conditioner, and then you use this brush and the detachable shower head to gently brush while rinsing. That gets some of the bigger tangles out, and doesn&#x27;t result in screaming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, I still have to use a wide tooth comb and spend some time pulling tangles from her hair. No amount of brushing with this brush is going to get them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For adult hair that is past chin length? Don&#x27;t even try it. Mine is past my shoulders and trying to brush it with this was a joke...and not even a funny one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it&#x27;s not a total waste of money, it does get some of the snarls out of her hair, but it&#x27;s far from the last brush you&#x27;ll need and is useless for adult hair and also for styling.</li>
    <li> I would love to take stock out in the company.  I have long hair that tangles easily.  It is very difficult to deal with.  I bought this brush at a store locally without any expectations.  It said it detangled and I thought, yeah sure, but grabbed it any way.  I had originally wanted one I saw advertised on t.v. but had not seen that in any store.  I looked at the reviews for that one here and they are not glowing at all.  Prior to using this brush I looked at the reviews for it here and thought, hmmm maybe I should take it out of the packaging and try it.  I bought 3 more after that.  I think everyone with long hair should own this brush.  I am just wondering if it will work on the dogs...will have to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually feel compelled to write reviews either positive or negative, but this product is really just that good!</li>
    <li> This really is a great brush.  I use it on my naturally curly hair, my 8 year old&#x27;s very long straight hair, my 5 and 1 year old boys&#x27; short hair.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old wanted this since his older sister has one. Makes combing hair painless. He uses it every day and now is even cuter. Did not think that was possible, but he is. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This brush is the best brush that we have used to get out tangles. We are in the pool almost every day in the summer and my girls have super thick and long hair. This brush has made it so much easier to brush through their hair and has eliminated lots of tears! Definitely worth it!!!</li>
    <li> Like most brushes that have a soft base into which the brush bristles insert, this brush has a black natural rubber body.  The odor from the brush is strong enough to notice when you walk into the bathroom, from across the room.  The brush functions just fine.  It&#x27;s as described.  The seller&#x27;s service was as expected.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy another of the exact same brush if the next one had the same odor.  Maybe it will become less noticeable after a few more weeks.  I&#x27;ve had it out of the package on my bathroom counter for about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 8/1/2013 - OK, I have to say I originally gave this 3-Stars due to the strong odor, which is still pretty heavy, but it has dissipated a little -BUT the proof is in the pudding, and our two daughters (8 and 6) prefer this brush over all other brushes in the house for WET HAIR brushing, post bath or shower.  So I have to say - this is a great brush after all.  I still have to say 4-Stars vs. 5 due to the odor, but for performance on wet-hair it&#x27;s a 5! Kid Tested, Kid Approved - and our girls are notorious for whining about and running from post bath hair brushing!!</li>
    <li> I can tell that it is yanking out a lot less of my hair than the average brushing, especially after just getting out of the shower. Much easier on the scalp; would recommend to anyone but especially if you tend to be tender-headed!</li>
    <li> This brush has been so helpful with brushing my 6 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.  It has definitely cut down on the whining and screaming that usually accompanies brushing her hair!</li>
    <li> It is actually time to order another...we&#x27;ve wore this one out! Love this brush! I used to fight with my daughter every night about brushing her hair and this has helped SO much! It doesn&#x27;t totally solve the brushing tangles problem, much it makes it so much easier and a lot less painful. She always complains now if we don&#x27;t use the wet brush...you can definitely tell the difference in this and a regular brush. Highly recommend for anyone with small children, but I also prefer using it myself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this brush, it runs so smoothly along wet hair --without the feeling you are ripping a lot of hair out, like the typical wide tooth comb i used to use.  Fast shipping and I&#x27;ve had less shedding after brushing my hair after a shower. I&#x27;m hooked</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t I think of this?!  Simple concept, and works great.  Great price, Definitely less pulling.  I feel like I&#x27;m being more kind to my hair and scalp. Even bought one as a gift for my niece..I swear you can look at her hair and its tangled.</li>
    <li> i fear washing my hair. well, i used to fear washing my hair. it&#x27;s silly but the thought if dealing with my hair post-wash used to prevent me from taking care of my hair as i should. i have very long thick hair that tangles if the breeze blows. a hair stylist at a salon used this brush on my hair for the first time and suggested if i liked it to buy one on amazon. i did notice there wasn&#x27;t the normal amount of ripping and tearing there normally is getting my hair ready for a cut at the salon. i heeded the stylist&#x27;s advice but didn&#x27;t take it too seriously either. i bought the wet brush initially as an add on for myself and have bought more for family and friends since using it. i haven&#x27;t had a significant haircut in almost 10 years...my hair is very damaged and extremely hard to deal with. this brush is A MIRACLE. its really one of those things you need to try for yourself to believe it. i was extremely skeptical but this thing REALLY WORKS!!! as far as longevity is concerned, i haven&#x27;t had it that long but at $6 i would buy 10 more for how well this works on my hair. no more ripping and pulling. no more dreading the shower. I LOOOOOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My little girl refuses to use any other brush on her hair now.  This brush gets the job done without pulls and snags.  Very nice for tender-headed little girls.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush. My 4 year old complains when I brush her hair but not with this brush. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I&#x27;ve had several kinds. My 20 month old daughter has no problem letting me brush her hair, it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. It works great on wet hair. This is the only hair brush I will buy from now on.</li>
    <li> It really does make brushing wet hair A LOT easier.  I did not find it 100% non-tugging -- but it is miles better than a regular brush.  I threw my old brush away after using this brush for 3 days.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush for my daughter&#x27;s natural curly hair. It gets the tangles out without pulling. Brushing her hair used to be a challenge but this brush has made it so much better....she still hates to have her hair brushed but it goes much quicker with this brush.</li>
    <li> I have hip length hair that is very fine and tangles very easily. This is always my go to brush when my hair is wet, it works amazingly. I had no idea that it was taking me 20-30 mins to detangle my hair because of the brush I was using. With this one, I&#x27;m done in 5 minutes or less and I&#x27;ve noticed a lot less hair in the brush when I&#x27;m finished. I use it dry as well but it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well. Overall, this is probably the best hairbrush I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why this works so well. My hair was beyond damaged from all the processing it has been put through.. I felt like a little kid in the morning... My hair was such a knot of damaged straw, I was breaking more hair everytime i brushed and it hurt!!  This wet brush just glides through it all... I also started using a hair repair mask twice a week... Two months later, with the use of  this brush and the mask.... My hair is in much better shape! And its cheap.  Got to love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this brush from my hair salon; it was 7$.  My stylist suggested it to me and also used it on my hair.  It works just like it says!  I have tangled wavy frizzy hair and this does not pull and detangles very nicely!</li>
    <li> Where would I be without this brush? Screaming? Crying? Chasing my two year old?? This thing is amazing. Not sure what makes it so special but it really is unique. I ordered one for travel as well. I just ordered another one for a curly haired friend. :) That makes 4 total I have bought. Do not wait for another tangle LOL buy this cool brush! Great gift, too!</li>
    <li> This brush is the bomb!</li>
    <li> My hair is shoulder length and this brush works well with wet and dry hair.  I ordered one for each of my granddaughters.</li>
    <li> The brush is awesome for kids with curly hair! My daughter is three and now let&#x27;s me brush her hair. I wished I knew about this years ago. We will not be using anything else from this point on.</li>
    <li> No more tears from my toddler - great brush.</li>
    <li> I have a daughter who hates to have her hair brushed now that we have this brush she asks to brush her own hair! Definitely a must have for little girls.</li>
    <li> Works great so far. I don&#x27;t seem to have as many screams coming from my two girls when brushing their hair.</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I glides through your hair without pulling. I would recommend this brush to anyone. I also bought one for each of my children so that I could keep mine!</li>
    <li> I was dreading combing through my daughter&#x27;s hair after her last shower. She had just returned from a visit to her dad&#x27;s, and when she is away she can go days without brushing or combing it well.  Her hair was so matted that I feared I’d have to cut it - again (yes, I had to take this measure once before, not too long ago.)  However, I got her this brush for Christmas and instead of the usual long, tedious, painful, tearful and heart-wrenching process, we were done in a matter of minutes, with no pain and her hair completely untangled.  We couldn’t believe it!  Her only question was: &amp;#34;Why have you waited so long to buy this for me?!?&amp;#34;  We were laughing and jumping, and just very happy to have found this wonderful brush.  My daughter is 12 and mixed, Afro-American-Latina, with thick, abundant, curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have a 6 year old daughter who has a really soft head apparently and many tangles.  She has fine long hair with just enough curl to cause many tangles.  I have tried everything, many different brushes, many different detanglers, at all price ranges to no avail.  A friend told me about this brush and I decided to give it one more try.  I&#x27;m really glad I did because it works!  She doesn&#x27;t cry and run away anymore.  It used to be a nightmare, but no more.  Finally!!!!</li>
    <li> My expectations may have been too high based on the product description. However, this brush did not detangle wet hair any better than any other similar brush I own. I have fine straight hair and am growing it longer. It gets very tangled and if I use a lot of conditioner it gets weighed down. This was not the solution i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> I have hair down to my waist that is very thick. I&#x27;d given up on brushing or combing it when I got out of the shower in the mornings at 5am. If I was lucky, my hair would by mostly dry and brushable by lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this brush, I can finally brush my hair before leaving the house and have it dry after only a couple of hours. I love this brush so much that I bought the travel size one for my purse.</li>
    <li> It is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; on a stick...this brush just goes through wet or dry hair, without tugging or pulling out hair....We don&#x27;t know how it works but it does !  Highly recommend this product !!</li>
    <li> My daughter is incredibly tender headed and mornings were a daily struggle with screaming and tears. This brush saved us from all that. It really did work that well. So well, she started brushing her hair daily on her own!</li>
    <li> Why didn&#x27;t they make these brushes years ago?  Brush through wet or dry hair with no pulling or pain.  Favorite brush!</li>
    <li> I recommend this brush to everyone ! My hair is horrible and hard to detangle and this brush does the magic !! I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years and now it&#x27;s time to get a new one they don&#x27;t last toooo long but it&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase . it&#x27;s the only brush I will ever buy . plus it&#x27;s cheaper on here than Sally&#x27;s ! and shipping was super quick ! it says it should have got here weeks later but i ordered about 4 days ago and I received it . I am 100% satisfied with the product and seller :)</li>
    <li> This brush is a lifesaver. I have very fine, easily tangled hair. Tangles have always been an issue, even as a kid my mom would dread brushing my hair. But now I have bleached hair and it was taking me 30 minutes to an hour to brush/comb through the mess after a shower. This brush doesn&#x27;t tug, and DESTROYS tangles without causing me any pain. I LOVE THIS BRUSH. Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long hair and loves to use this brush.  No more pulling the knots out.  I would recommend this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for me and loved it so much I had to get one for my daughter too!!</li>
    <li> I have 3 of these now and won&#x27;t buy anything else. Great for sensitive little heads and curly hair that gets kinks easily!</li>
