      <li>When I received this product it was exactly as described when ordering.</li>

      <li>I checked at many of the local beauty supply stores and retailers and was told I could only purchase via the web or through a stylist.</li>
      <li>I combing thru many reviews pros and cons, natural hair blogs, You Tube reviews, and look at the texture of other people hair to see how closely their texture relates to my own before I folk up my hard earned dollar bills.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ I have been transitioning from a relaxer for over 3 months and I really like this product. I use it with the  KeraCare Shampoo and the Natural Textures leave-in conditioner. I am still blow drying my hair after I wash it. This products adds the needed moisture. I have not done the big chop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I like the texture of it. It is a heavy cream.&lt;br /&gt;+ I used Affirm relaxers for more than 10 years and I absolutely love the KeraCare line when my hair was chemically treated.  So it was not a hard decision for me to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- I wish this was a little cheaper. But, I am willing to pay the $12 listed  by this Amazon vendor for now. I could not find it at JC Penny or Wal-Mart Salon, which is where I used to get KeraCare products.</li>
    <li> good to have, i would say. It makes your hair soft and that&#x27;s about it..Nothing to WHAUGHSUADSADBASJB about. ya know?</li>
    <li> This water based daily moisturizing Butter Cream leaves the hair supple, feeling soft, and thoroughly moisturized. This cream should be used when you need a heavier moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Just wanted to say that I agree with all of the KeraCare praise.&lt;br /&gt;I have a friend who let me try the one she had left and I can honestly say WOW!!! Not only was my hair soft, but it coiled right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prayed that Amazon has it and indeed it&#x27;s available! Can&#x27;t wait to purchase it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for natural hair. not greasy and hair is soft and it help my hair to get healthy and grow. I would recognize this product to anyone with natural hair.</li>
    <li> The Butter Cream works excellent on my 5 year old daughters hair.  Her hair is naturally curly.  I love the prduct and will continue to order more.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by a friend. I really like the way it makes my hair feel. My hair is easire to manage. I will order this product again from this company.</li>
    <li> This product is amazon. It really works wonders for my hair. I m in the process of going natural. I have very thick hair which need alot of moisture. this is my number one hair product that I will use forever.</li>
    <li> I am not a woman of color but these products do moisturize my frizzy hair well. Don&#x27;t need a lot and the scent is terrific.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t care for this product, although I do love the Kera shampoo and conditioner.  It seems to stay on top of the hair without ever absorbing into the shaft.  It leaves the African American hair types filmy, and will need to be washed out after one application to avoid product flaking and build up.</li>
    <li> I am very sensitive to smells and every time I use this product my eyes feel gritty and my nose runs and stops up and my head feel tight as if I may be allergic to a substance it contains.  But as to its effectiveness, it seems to work ok.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Easy to use on dry hair.  My hair felt moisturized, but I also used a sealer.  My hair didn&#x27;t feel weighed down or greasy.</li>
    <li> this product is ok. I have 4c hair type. My hair is very thick and needs as much moisture as possible and this product was just ok. smells great but after applying MY hair did not feel moisturized. and as far as it being a butter cream it felt more like a lotion then actual cream.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, can be used everyday and perfect for naturals and curly naturals. it softens and keeps fly away ends together.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR IS NATURAL; I LIKE THIS PRODUCT, I DO NOT HAVE TO USE THIS PRODUCT DAILY, BECAUSE IT PROVIDE JUST THAT MUCH MOISTURE FOR ME.  I WILL CONTINUE TO USE AND I DO RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Best product of the product line, but not worth the price. There are better products out there that work just as good, if not better, for my hair.</li>
    <li> I make no qualms, there are only two product lines that I recommend for natural hair, but like how everyone has a different texture/scalp; not all products are for everyone. Kera&#x27;s Butter Cream is a great moisturizing cream that leaves hair feeling good and moist, but not greasy and wet. Currently in a dry hot climate, and recommending this product to several colleagues who all have nothing but positive things to say. Definitely worth the dry as a daily product.</li>
    <li> I liked the texture of the butter cream.  It kept my hair really moisturized for a whole week.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
    <li> Good product with a tingling sensation when applied on the scalp. Helped with scalp irritation.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone with natural hair to at least try once. I actually love KeraCare products used it when I had a perm it did very well on my hair. Now I&#x27;m going to try the other natural hair care products they provide and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
    <li> This moisturizer smells great.It makes my hair so soft and easy to manage.I have never had a perm or relaxer.I wash my hair press it out lightly.This moisturizer holds good with my hair.I have soft hair.I also bought the conditioner and shampoo also.My hair and scalp is not dry or itchy anymore.</li>
    <li> I will start off by saying this product does exactly what it says..unlike most hair products out there for curly hair. I have wavy hair, about a 2b..I have TONS of hair, and this works wonders, it moisturizes my hair so well and other curl products aren&#x27;t thick/heavy enough for me and this is ideal for wavy hair too..not just kinky/curly!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for moisturizing natural hair. I use it on my little girl and it works great! I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Now this is the truth. This is a wonderful product, keeps my hair soft and moist all day in the Caribbean sun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve decided to stop pressing and flat ironing my dyed (only the top and sides are dyed), 4c, 3 to 4 inch below the shoulder hair and start pulling back in a nice bun for about 6 months so I can start to see growth. I first wash my hair with a no poo shampoo, a good condtioner mixed with jojoba and sit under the dryer for about 1/2 hour or so, then rinse with cool water to close my cuticle. I then put in Keracare leave in conditioner topped with Butter Cream and then I seal with jojoba. I put a part on the side and take a wooden brush to gently lay the front down and you would swear i had a relaxer in my hair. It left my 4c (kinky) hair with soft waves. I then pulled back in a scrunchy (not to tight) and then put on a satin scarf pulled tight. I go to bed and when I wake up I have to do NOTHING TO MY HAIR! Seriously! I use the butter cream everyday. After 6 months I plan to flat iron so I can clip my ends and stop heat again for another 6 months. I will give you an update on hair growth in 6 months. This ones a keeper!</li>
    <li> I use this product for my three year old daughters daily regime, by far it is the best product I have used.  I have tried so many products I could not begin to name them all.  The only drawback - the price is a little high.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0054Y2D2A Avlon KeraCare Natural Textures Butter Cream 8 oz]] One of the absolute best hair moisturizer creme on the market (for my hair type)!!! Yeah I said it like that because it is like that. I do my research thoroughly before I try a product. I combing thru many reviews pros and cons, natural hair blogs, You Tube reviews, and look at the texture of other people hair to see how closely their texture relates to my own before I folk up my hard earned dollar bills. The creme has a buttery, lotion type feeling when I rub it around on my finger tips. I test it on my leg to see how long it keep an area moisten... It past the test. Also I always add a few drops of castor oil to all my hair products and found that I did not have to do this with this creme. I have thin but highly dense naturally curly (its is thick... 3c with a mixture of 4a/4b... I am a true mutt)... meaning when Jerry Curls where out...I could just used the activator and get the same look as a person with the chemical process. This stuff is great. Non greases or oily just right. Try it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed if you have hair like mines at least.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for a little over a year now &amp; I&#x27;ve still been struggling to find the right stuff to moisturize my natural hair. It needs to be light enough to not weigh my hair down, but have enough moisture to keep my curls from looking dry. I haven&#x27;t used this a whole lot, because like most girls transitioning from relaxed to natural hair, I&#x27;m still in my product junky phase -- so I&#x27;ve got a drawer full of lightly used creams, custards, &amp; curl jellies. But I like what little I have used of this product. It has a pleasant smell, is very light, but still slightly emollient enough, without being overly greasy.</li>
    <li> Since going natural December 2010, it&#x27;s difficult at times to find products that work with your hair type.  The Keracare Naturals haircare line has been great for me.  The Butter Cream Everyday Moisturizer has become my favorite staple.  I love the way it feels, and it smells great!  The moisture it provides is awesome and I&#x27;ve worn the best twist-outs using this on damp hair.  Once dry, my natural curls are full, fluffed, soft, moisturized, and shiny. And my hair smells edible. This product is DEFINITELY A WINNER!!!!</li>
    <li> I just love this product.  I just bought the moisturizer and night moisturizer last Friday, and I could immediately see the difference with my hair.  I have natural hair and I had tried all sorts of products including Shima Hair(would not recommend this crap).  None of them beat the Keracare products.  I am very happy with the results and I will continue to purchase the products again. Thank you Keracare!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  Not greasy, great softening, no build-up, and rinses out easily. Nice, soft scent too.</li>
    <li> I did the big chop back in 2009 and have been natural every since. It was so hard finding products that didn&#x27;t strip my hair, under nourish it, or make it feel like I had an oil slick going on. (LOL) After reading the reviews on different products I tried this line. I wash my hair with KeraCare Hydrating Detangling Shampoo (and it does not strip my hair) then I use the KeraCare Natural Textures Leave In Conditioner. I comb my hair then I apply the KeraCare Natural Textures Butter Cream. It leaves my hair so soft and hydrated. I love these products and glad I gave them a try. After wasting so much money on other products this is what I&#x27;ll stick to.</li>
    <li> One of the best products for moisturizing my school aged girls thick, coiled African American hair.  Really keeps their hair shiny without looking or feeling greasy. Smells great also. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> love this stuff! it works great and keeps my natural hair soft and moisturized. the shipping was super fast as well and i will definitely order again</li>
    <li> I ordered the KeraCare butter cream everyday moisturizer. I have ordered this product through another website in the past but found the price to be more reasonable with Amazon. I checked at many of the local beauty supply stores and retailers and was told I could only purchase via the web or through a stylist. After trying many hair products I found this one to be better priced and work the best on my curly hair type. When I received this product it was exactly as described when ordering. I use it everyday and it is a must have!</li>
    <li> It gives your hair a nice smooth feeling. What I&#x27;ve done is added Jojoba oil to this mix to enhance the softness of my hair. Great product! I absolutely love the smell of it too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! As does my hair. It keeps my 4c hair soft and well moisturized. It also has Argan oil in it  (among other fantastic oils) and is completely natural --no cones! This cream has also made my hair grow! When I wore weaves I would use the butter cream to make the curls look more defined &amp; less frizzy. I have tried a few other moisturizers but I also go back to my butter cream, it is simply the best. The price is a little above average, but sadly this cream is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my 4c hair! I love it and use it daily! It leaves my hair feeling soft and non greasy.</li>
    <li> I rated KeraCare, natural textues butter creme a 5, this product moisturizes, adds sheen, softens and leaves no greasy residue. I will be purchasing more of this product,I wish I had known earlier about KeraCare. But so glad to have discovered it. Thanks.</li>
