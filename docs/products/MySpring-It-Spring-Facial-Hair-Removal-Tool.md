<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Pulls out a little hair, but not the super fine facial hair I bought it for.</li>
    <li> works well if you can take a little ouch. It does pull hair out as described</li>
    <li> Love it. It does not always work for super short hairs though.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done and gets the job safe! I likes it! You will enjoy this product with hair getting out of your skin for life!</li>
    <li> It is a completely useless item, not worth spending your hard earned money. Please save ur money to spend on better products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the R.E.M. spring, but for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I am always losing mine so these are perfect cause I can buy as many as I need.</li>
    <li> It works way better than i anticipated. It is more efficient than tweezers. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an alternative to tweezers.</li>
    <li> I previoudly purchased and lost the REM hair remover (loved it) and decided to try this one. Construction is cheaper and my skin started breaking out, now Im not posiive that it was because of the different metal but it has cleared and I continue to use it still.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. I still need to go to the salon for waxing but this works during good between visits.</li>
    <li> This thing was horrible. I read reviews and thought I&#x27;d get it but it&#x27;s cheap and ridiculous</li>
    <li> Really?????  I would send this back if it wasn&#x27;t that it cost next to nothing.  No idea how to use it.  Should have stuck with my reading of the one review that agreed.</li>
    <li> I just got this today and it works well for me! It&#x27;s very easy to use, it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions (my packaging was in Chinese so idk) so you can just search it on Youtube! It takes MOST of the hairs away, I have to go over the area a couple times to remove the hairs. There are a few hairs it won&#x27;t pick up but that&#x27;s okay I can just use tweezers since it&#x27;s not a lot. It also doesn&#x27;t hurt for me at all because I&#x27;m used to tweezing. The seller shipped the next day and the product came about 10 days earlier than it said it would. I would buy again and recommend this!</li>
    <li> I got this being how I heard it was good but it doesn&#x27;t really work how it should and won&#x27;t pull all hairs</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I thought that using a spring to tear out my facial hairs individually at the root was a good idea, cause it&#x27;s not. Pretty painful, not that user friendly. I&#x27;d rather just wax.</li>
    <li> This thing hurts like a mug and doesn&#x27;t get the fine hairs that it says it does. I threw it away after a few tries.</li>
    <li> Junk. The tool is sturdy strong and well made. Unfortunately, the product does not remove facial hair. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Seems to work as well as the higher priced similar tools, but the ends of each handle has a sharp piece of plastic that I keep rubbing against when using this.  I&#x27;ll have to file it down.  Aside from that, worth the price, and even though it arrived 10 days earlier than expected, it still seemed to take an awful long time to get here.  I guess I didn&#x27;t realize it was coming from overseas when I ordered it.</li>
    <li> uh, dont buy this it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I bought this from supersaving360 and it definitely wasn&#x27;t the one from Beauty By Rachel, it was in some Japanese packing with instructions. It&#x27;s worked pretty good and definitely painful at first, especially around the upper lip. I&#x27;ve been seeing a lot of people complaining about the pain, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I&#x27;d much rather sit at home while watching Netflix and use MySpringIt than drive to go get my whole face threaded for $30.</li>
    <li> i read the reviews. the person who said they were stocking up because it is better than a long list of hair removal types HAS to be a paid reviewer. this thing doesn&#x27;t work. i&#x27;ve tried all hair remove products too. this is one of the worst. it will pull some fine hairs out. but it takes way longer than tweezing. the epilady is better than this. i paid $5 for this. better than the $20 that other ones are but i&#x27;d say save your $$ and buy good tweezers with a light and magnifying mirror. you&#x27;ll be better off. it&#x27;s worth less than $1.</li>
    <li> I orded this with high hopes that it would be the solution to my blonde peach fuzz. I recived it on time, packaged fairly well with plastic around wrapped around the spring. Anyways, onto the product i used it as soon as i got it. It was easy to use (once you get the hang of it). One of the handles came off but i was able to put it back in and havent had a problem with it popping out since. Pain level? I&#x27;d be lying if i said i didn&#x27;t hurt but it wasn&#x27;t anything i couldn&#x27;t manage. I kind of like that i can feel the hairs beinging pulled out.  It does take a while to get all the hairs though. So i&#x27;d suggest doing this when you have free time and maybe before bed because (at least for me) it tends to turn my skin red for a while. Also i did end up getting itchy red bumps all over my cheeks from this. (Remember though i do have sensitive skin) and it did remove the hairs i wanted it to. Its been almost a week and those bumps are still there although they have reduced (i ended up having to buy prosacea to help with the redness and bumps).&lt;br /&gt;I do love how this was a cheap alternative to waxing and much faster than tweezing every hair one by one. Easy to use and can even be used as your watching tv (just watch that hair line!!) for the price i paid (about $3) i can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
    <li> Jury still out.  Appears to work as advertised.  Time will confirm.</li>
    <li> It does remove the hair and it does sting a bit at first but it removes the hair and you get use to it after a while. It takes some time getting use to but to me for the price it is worth it.</li>
    <li> Bought it at the request from my wife, she is very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the REM was way better. This one doesn&#x27;t twist all the way as much. It does the job but it takes longer than the REM.</li>
    <li> What? I think I&#x27;m missing something here.</li>
    <li> It works... if you can stand the minor pain.</li>
    <li> This product works well. Beware it does hurt!!</li>
    <li> i watched some videos on youtube before purchasing this. a friend had recommended this tool, a different more expensive brand tho. when i found this one the reveiws were good &amp; the price was great so i gave it a shot. it took me a few tries before i got the hang of it. the main thing is u have to bend it like an upside down &amp;#34;U&amp;#34; or horseshoe. then as u open it u simultaneously roll up. i have a wax machine and i still use it on a regular basis but i like having the MySpringIt on hand because sometimes i dont feel like waxing. i will say this, the spring does hurt a bit. but once u get going u kind of get numb to it. great for travel. i use it for my upper lip &amp; just below my lower lip on occassion.</li>
    <li> Slow and painful but very effective I think I would rather wax just because the pain is in one quick stroke. This for me was kind of like torture. But it did work so maybe for someone who can handle more face pain than I it would be great.</li>
    <li> Once I got the hang of it, I can report it definitely works to remove facial hair.  However, it won&#x27;t pick up finite hair until it is longer than I care to have on my upper lip.</li>
    <li> Works very well. I&#x27;m very satisfied.Glad I tried it.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to and a lot of tears and pain, but I would much prefer getting threaded than to use this over and over on my skin just to get results.</li>
    <li> We bought this for my wife and she loves it.  It easily removes hair no matter where it is.  She tried it out on my arm and, although it hurt a little, it did a great job.  All the hairs come right now, none were broken short and no stubble was left.  The price makes this very affordable and a great buy.</li>
    <li> When I got the MySpringIt and used it for the first time, I wasn&#x27;t sure on how to use it. I tried moving it upwards and downwards but to no avail. I feel like you&#x27;re supposed to move it upwards because that was the only time hairs were plucked. When I use the MySpringIt, I don&#x27;t have good control or precision. For example, I only wanted to pluck the outer upper lip hair, but I kept on plucking all of the lip hair. Surprisingly, this product wasn&#x27;t as great as I expected and the price was cheaper than I expected. The MySpringIt is supposed to be about $17 dollars (if I remember correctly), while I only paid about $3. The MySpringIt works like a product worth only $3.</li>
    <li> The coil is to large for fine hair......</li>
    <li> Took forever to get this thing delivered.  I almost forgot I had ordered it.  I tried it out and it worked great and fast at ripping the hairs off the face.  It will definitely get the eyes watering good - ouch!  And the upper lip was a bit sensitive for a few hours afterwards, but no sores or blemishes.  So far over a week later there is no sign of hair returning.  Might have been a bit less painful if I had done it soon after getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Silly, silly, idea. What was I thinking when I purchased this. I never figured out how to use it.</li>
    <li> Ever since having our first baby, I&#x27;ve had a few little problem spots around my chin where I wanted to remove a few extra stray hairs... my face is too sensitive for waxing, and tweezing is sometimes just ... not fun.  I saw this little tool at a local State Fair and had to give it a try.  I love it!  It does often require a few passes over the same spot, but it really works well, and if you are working on a really sensitive spot, use a little Orajel to numb it a little.  Works great!</li>
    <li> OK, nice principle but some practice is needed to get it right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 27yr old Latina with very sensitive skin i&#x27;ve tried almost everything to remove ALL my UNWANTED facial hair after many lessons learned the hard way of what&#x27;s not for me  i have FINALLY found what works for me it really isn&#x27;t a REAL springIt it comes in a Chinese or some kind of foreign plastic paper label i had googled  for a new way to remove my hair and came across this springIt thing and saw demonstrations of how to do it on YouTube i was like OUCH but they had all said doesn&#x27;t irritate skin like other things well decided to try it and needless to say MONEY WELL SPENT IT&#x27;S AMAZING idk if its just because of my ethnicity or what lol but i was on my face for a good while looked like evrything was gone but then i keeped going and felt it pulling again and again won&#x27;t lie it does take like 5-10min to get the technique down but after that it&#x27;s super easy i have a high tolerance for pain and was expecting to use it but it&#x27;s not bad u become numb to it one little secret i found is if u maneuver it in a different position like vertically&amp; side2side u&#x27;ll get more in one stroke ONE more thing you&#x27;re better off ordering the pack of 5because i ordered this and a 5pack it&#x27;s the same thing package &amp;all but u don&#x27;t pay $5 for one u pay $5 for 5  so yup that&#x27;s pretty much it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let my threading lady know...this thing is awesome. Helps between threading visits. My threading lady says my &amp;#34;growth is less&amp;#34; but really...I just use this inbetween visits, cuts my cost in half and great results all month! One of the handles came of but I just pushed it back on. It is a cheap product, but it works so who can complain too much.</li>
    <li> It took my a little while to get it right but once I did I was very happy with it. For the price this is a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I was super skeptical when I ordered this. Read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. It really works!!!&lt;br /&gt; I had no problem figuring out how to use it.  Much better than waxing creating the same effect, My lip &amp; lower chin area are a problem for me  it was so much fun seeing this work. Left my skin completely smooth with very little redness. Waxing is not good for me because I use Retin A. Other reviews say that it hurts, for me it was just a tingly feeling, no big deal.  Absolutely buy it, so worth it.</li>
    <li> Since reaching menopause my face has undergone a dramatic change. So after a couple of years of watching things get worse I came across this product and ordered it.  I was set to be disappointed but I was not!  I only have seen young girls giving reviews and they all said it doesn&#x27;t work well anywhere but straight up the cheeks and from the cheek to the upper lip.  If you brush the hair on your jawline in the opposite from which it grows and run the My spring It horizontally instead of vertically you will be able to remove alot of the jawline hair. Same with that just under the jawbone.  It does hurt but it&#x27;s not something you can&#x27;t take for a couple of minutes a night.  I find it quite painful on the upper lip so make sure you only do a small space per night.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I read about the Myspring it one or two months ago online and had been wanting one ever since! I recently got this as a birthday gift from a friend who bought it off Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it. When you roll it on your face, it just rips the hairs right off! Sometimes it won&#x27;t get every single hair, but if you go over it 2 or 3 more times, you can get rid of the ones left behind. Even though it&#x27;s not completely painless, once you use it for a while you get use to it. My other friends who have one and myself definitely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to someone else.</li>
    <li> I does not work well on the black mustach hair.  Works on the blonde hair and under the chin and neck.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. Glad I did not but the expensive one. if I was going this route again I will go with NO NO.</li>
    <li> its work . First  I was sceptical , but I found this is works +I noticed that facial hair regrow much slowly</li>
    <li> I have a lot of facial hair not only around my mouth but up along my cheeks. I was hoping this would help but you have to be at daily in order for it to be effective, not to mention it&#x27;s ludicrously painful. For stubborn female fuzz, try a razor instead. It is a fallacious myth that it&#x27;ll grow back thicker or darker--it doesn&#x27;t and it wont. Shaving also makes the skin soft and smooth and make-up applies a heckuva lot easier. There is this product called Tinkle Razors (why in the world they&#x27;d name it that, I don&#x27;t know) that is very effective and extremely cheap. Use downward strokes once or twice a week and viola!</li>
    <li> In order to remove the facial hair with this tool, the skin needs to be tight, so it&#x27;s impossible because you need to use both hands to use this tool, while someone assists you to hold your skin. Yes it&#x27;s cheap but not functional.</li>
    <li> boy is this a time saver.  it gets the fine hair as well as the whiskers that occasionally pop up.  and I don&#x27;t have to pluck one at a time.</li>
    <li> I ordered several of these to compare the quality for the price on each. This was not the highest quality...but it did work and the price was fabulous!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work worth a &amp;#34;tinker&#x27;s damn&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove hair</li>
    <li> Sometimes breaks the hair instead of pulling it or removing it. It hurts, but the pain isn&#x27;t unbearable. It&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Painful piece of junk</li>
    <li> Cannot give perfect review for this because I am not able to use it properly because directions and instructions on it are all in chinese or some other language and not in english</li>
    <li> Never could get it to work.</li>
    <li> It simply didn&#x27;t work! The rotating action was difficult to maintain! Though I had heard it worked for others, it didn&#x27;t for me!</li>
    <li> Just got this a few minutes ago and already cleared all the tiny hairs off my upper lip.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, it doesn&#x27;t tickle but it really works and is much quicker than plucking individual hairs or shaving them every day.  Heard about this type of tool on Pinterest and glad I bought this one.</li>
    <li> This product saves me soooo much time and energy. It is super simple to use. Its is a little more painful than plucking but well worth it because of the time you save. I ever saw my husband use it and he likes the convenience as well. product is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> This thing is super handy once you guy use to it. It&#x27;s true, it&#x27;s a little hard to get individual hairs, but for ones like that you can use tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;With this thing, I can just sit idly while I watch a movie and use it on my chin or wherever. It might hurt in some places and my friend said that she can&#x27;t use it on her upper lip because it hurts too much. This is the first hair removal thing I&#x27;ve used that isn&#x27;t just shaving-- and I&#x27;ve never used anything on my face -- and I works well and doesn&#x27;t hurt that badly. Pain depends on the person.&lt;br /&gt;ANd as for using it, it takes a bit to get use to how to move it and actually get anything, but once you find the method, you&#x27;ll know!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my spring it! It works great. At first it hurts a little, but after you use it for awhile you get used to it (like tweezong) it&#x27;s super easy, it&#x27;s FAST, and it works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> Although this works well. I didn&#x27;t receive the lil bag that it was supposed to come with.</li>
    <li> I was not able to remove many hairs. The spring bends far too much when you hold it towards the end. You need to hold it tighter towards the middle for it to work a little bit.</li>
    <li> Maybe is just me : but i was never able to use this ! I guess i&#x27;ll stick to the wax .</li>
    <li> i expected this gadget to really take out most of the fine hairs from my upper lips, but it does not do a very good job</li>
    <li> for the price it is ok that the spring is a bit thicker than the more expensive ones.... i looked everywhere locall y for this item and some places thought I was making somethign up.. so I jsut searched and amazon came to the rescue again... I love it for the bf&#x27;s back.. way better than wax!!</li>
    <li> I did love this.  It really worked!  But, a few weeks later, I went to use it again, and found it rusted.  What a let down.  I had finally found an awesome moustache control.  Too bad I only got to use it once.  The only reason this gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because it actually worked.  How about making it in stainless?  I&#x27;d pay more for that.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I love eyebrow threading and it&#x27;s the only type of hair removal that I can stand to sit through.  This product is so obvious, it&#x27;s like …why didn&#x27;t I think of that?!  It&#x27;s a very simple concept, you use the spring to roll over the hairs you&#x27;d like removed, and it yanks them out.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for the eyebrows because it is a bit hard to control.  It&#x27;s easy to use, other than that.  It&#x27;s very easy to clean, obviously, stretch the spring and BAM, hairs out.  It can be a little bit painful on the upper lip BUT it&#x27;s very very effective.  The only reason I got it was for the upper lip area, it was only a dollar and will probably last forever.  WAYYYY better than buying wax strips or dye or paying someone to remove the hair there!!</li>
    <li> I got this product delivered yesterday and used it at once. At the beginning I kinda was using it wrong, it didn&#x27;t get any hair removed by it, then I searched in you tube how to use it and used accordingly, It took me 10 mins to finish my upper lip and cheeks. I can literally see those hair stuck in this spring. It works amazing, cheap and quick. So gals, don&#x27;t hesitate, go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> Sort of painful but gets job done. Sometimes caused me to bleed. I don&#x27;t know if it was from where hair was removed or if the thing was tearing off my skin. I still like it though.</li>
    <li> This little spring stick thingy works really well, and leaves my face smooth.  No more paying for lip and chin waxing!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought. Doesn&#x27;t remove hair. It was not worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> I think this junk... Went in the trash...</li>
    <li> I have peach fuzz.  It isn&#x27;t terribly heavy,  but in bright light it can be seen....and it makes my complexion look dull.  Used to use Nair facial hair remover with good results but it smells awful and makes my skin feel like it is burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love &#x27;MySpring&#x27;, and found out that you have to get creative to remove the hair.  For the sides of my cheeks...I kept the spring fairly straight and rolled it against my skin.  You have to roll over several times to get most of the hairs.  For the chin or upper lip, it is best used as demo&#x27;d in the photo advert...an inverted &#x27;U&#x27;.  The other thing is that you need to have flexible fingers and good dexterity to use this spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t painful, but you can feel the pulling...a bit like tweezing.</li>
    <li> I got fooled into trying this product by it&#x27;s low price and promise of quick at-home threading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a young Caucasian woman with plentiful, but fine blonde hairs on my upper lip. If I don&#x27;t tweeze or wax them, you see a slight shadow of fuzz. I normally have my upper lip waxed at a salon, but I was sick of making the trip and then breaking out each month with acne from the wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I ordered this affordable product based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, those reviews must be manipulated somehow - because there&#x27;s no way this product worked as some folks claim it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You completely get what you paid for with this product and you only paid a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is not in English, so I could not turn to the directions for aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read these online reviews and tried every which way you could hold, pull, loosen, twirl, turn, or bend this product. I think it plucked 1 hair for every 8 tries I made. Although it would pull on hairs, it frequently wouldn&#x27;t remove any of them or it would remove only 1 hair. 1 single hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is a total waste. I gave up after trying it multiple times over two days. I just decided to use a tweezer as that was much faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably end up getting waxed again soon. Please heed my warning and don&#x27;t waste your time or money with this junk.</li>
    <li> painful hair removal process! not really sure how to clean it afterwards but does the job and well!</li>
    <li> Have it, just sits in the drawer, didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll stick to getting threaded. Maybe will try again.</li>
    <li> Hurts just as much as waxing - if not more! Awkward to use and still hurts. Would rather wax for the quick &amp;#34;rip&amp;#34; as opposed to pulling out hairs slowly and sporadically.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work. I tried every possible way I could. I checked out you tube videos and tried again. Still didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> this hurts SO much. i had watched youtube videos of this product before purchasing, so i do realize it&#x27;s not a &#x27;pain free&#x27; process but WOWZA. i already tossed this in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for hair removal. This by far is the best home product for hair removal. It hurts a little in the beginning but not that bad.</li>
    <li> It kinda works but it hurts and to get every hair out it would take forever. Got it for my daughter but I won&#x27;t be giving it to her. She wouldn&#x27;t have the patience.</li>
    <li> The price was right and I grabbed two of them.  They are &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; - not of exceptionally good quality but what do you expect for a spring on two plastic handles.  I probably could have crafted this out of a spring in my husband&#x27;s tool box with the same effect.  Yup.  It hurts when you use it - not sure I am down with the idea of rolling a spring all over my face for the sheer pain of it.  After a couple of attempts, I bailed on the use of these gizmos.  Too bad the spring doesn&#x27;t coil on its own.  Would make a darn good slinky  !  Not worth the pain factor.  Ouch !</li>
    <li> It works perfectly and the price was awesome...I believe I got a good deal! Not as painful as I thought, Thanks a bunch! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different depilatory methods and this is one of the stranger ones.  First, it doesn&#x27;t come with any instructions so you have to either play with it until you figure it out, or go look it up on the internet.  I did both because intuitive it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finally figured out how to work with it -- and I really recommend you check out this video on YouTube: Hair Removal - Tried and Tested: EP9 for a good overview of how it works -- I found that it HURT!  Yes, I know pulling hair out of your body does hurt but I have waxed and plucked and it was nothing like this.  It also doesn&#x27;t actually remove all the hair it tugs on, so you might be forced to use it several times in the same spot before you manage to de-fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, painful, and only somewhat useful?  Meh, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be throwing out my tweezers any time soon.</li>
    <li> It takes a little getting used to and a little trial and error to figure out exactly how to use it.  I think I&#x27;ve conquered it, and I really like it now.  Just be patient.  You will figure it out eventually.</li>
    <li> First of all...it took almost three weeks for this item to ship directly from China.  Then when it arrived, I took this gadget through a test, holding and rolling it in all directions.  The hair remained in the areas and I was disappointed.  Although the price was less than $2 and its return was not worth the effort, I would not recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This thing HURTS! but seriously what are you expecting pulling hairs out to be. It pulls out multiple hairs at a time making it really fast and convenient and after you use it a couple of times you don&#x27;t feel it but keep it consistent!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work all that great. I gave it a try but waxing still works the best. I had hopes in this little device so a little disappointed</li>
    <li> I got this for my travel bag... I own another brand that I paid  $15 for and use it religiously. The spring is too loose. What a waste of time and money.  Spend the money on a nice one.</li>
    <li> Literally the most painful thing!</li>
    <li> Wow, do I not like this thing!  I had hoped this would help with facial hair and I CAN&#x27;T TELL YOU HOW BADLY THIS HURTS and it didn&#x27;t get the ones I wanted, just the finer hair that I didn&#x27;t care about.</li>
    <li> I literally threw it away after a week, it doesn&#x27;t get the job done! I&#x27;d say you are better off waxing those unwanted hairs!</li>
    <li> This tool works very well. Yes its a little painful at first, but so is plucking and waxing.  Waxing causes rash and break out for me so Im excited to have an alternative to that! Will update once we see how the hair comes back in.  I would buy this again any day of the week.</li>
    <li> It works to pull hair out at the root, so it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. You have to get the twirling method right to catch hairs, so you have to keep going of the same section of your skin to grab on those tiny hairs, but it will get them even the ones that are not truly visible. A bit time consuming I liken it to a simulated threading. :)  Takes LONG time to arrive, but I was not in a hurry to get it.</li>
    <li> I suggest prospective buyers watch videos of how to use this product before purchasing it. Once you get the technique down, this item will last for a very long time. :)</li>
    <li> Great for those very fine hairs that are hard to get with a tweezers.  Fairly easy to use...just twice.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m nearly 70 yrs old and this is not &amp;#34;new.&amp;#34;  I remember ordering a similar hair removal spring from a True Confessions or True Love magazine advertisement back in the late 50&#x27;s early 60&#x27;s. lol  Ouch!  Good price though.</li>
    <li> This keeps the peach fuzz cleaned off of my face without me having to shave or use depilatory creams, which can burn your face.  I like that they&#x27;re cheap and reusable.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I completely love it!!!! It is supper easy and fast and MUCH LESS painful than using the tweezers in all that area!!! Usually after using this product, I need to use the tweezers for a very light touch up in the side of the mouth. nothing mayor.</li>
    <li> It really works, but I hope they come with instructions to use it, I have to figure out and in the process I think I could avoid some pain. LOl However, pain is not a lot compared to wax.</li>
    <li> I was looking for spring enhanced tweezers and I received a spring with cheap plastic ends on it.  They fell off the first use and using a spring to remove hair is very painful, worse then tweezers, because you often have more then one hair caught at a time.</li>
    <li> I tried everything and couldnt get it to do ANYTHING! I&#x27;m not sure if there is a technique for it but I had no luck</li>
    <li> Really works but hurts the first couple of times you use it. You get use to it. Good investment .</li>
    <li> Product works well just not very comfortable to use and have to cover area multiple times until all hair is removed.</li>
    <li> The second time I used it the holders on the end popped off. I noticed they are just held on with glue and there is no way they will stay on during use.  Other than that they work as described..</li>
    <li> Should be illegal to sell these.  They are completely worthless.  Waste of time and money. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am not impressed at all, price is great but product is lacking.  never pulled the black hairs I wanted gone, but pulled out the hard to see baby fuss that can stay.  I will stick to waxing at home, same amount of time and a guarantee all hair is gone.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product is exactly what I was hoping for! I was worried after I bought it because people said that the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; reviews were staged. Then other people said it was no good and didn&#x27;t work at all. That couldn&#x27;t be more wrong! It is surprisingly amazing. Seriously, you just sorta pulls the ends out then let loose, then out and let loose. You can bend it, then straighten it on the hairs, and it catches them! It&#x27;s not necessarily thorough so you have to do it several times, feel around on your face and go to that area with it. So easy, no need for a mirror. Tweezers were helpful for some of the facial hairs that were trying to become ingrown. It catches all of those little hairs on my chin and even upper lip. It catches the thicker hairs too. I put it on the top of my eyebrows for those fine hairs that get in the way of my eyebrow shape. I think they&#x27;re right about not using it on the lower eyebrow because it could really hurt that thin skin. Whoever said that this product was painful is really a wimp. This is nothing. Tweezers hurt worse. This was actually not painful at all.  I really think this is a product that needs to be sold in stores in the U.S. Just a great, great hair removal idea. It took forever, forever getting to me, almost a month!!! People could really make some money on this product.</li>
    <li> Actually does work but found it real painful stopped using it in the first 5 minutes .maybe after next use it won&#x27;t be so painful</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s little tricky and not effective, looks OK only for upper lips. Didn&#x27;t fee comfortable to use. : : :</li>
    <li> It does not work at all. I am very disappointed. It&#x27;s just seller&#x27;s marketing skill to claim it&#x27;s better than REM spring, but it does not pull a single hair. It&#x27;s not flexible to bend well at first place. Do not waste your money on this. REM spring is the BEST!!!</li>
    <li> what do you do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what ever it does, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;got wax strips next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;took a long time to arrive too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, it&#x27;s cute, if you can figure it out.</li>
    <li> How does that woman smile?  I bet she was shot up with Botex!  Handy little gadget if one was a traveling torturer in the middle ages.</li>
    <li> If you are tired of the old one-at-a-time tweezer pull give this little gadget a try.  I was surprised at how effective it is. Granted it stings a bit as you roll it over your skin and it pulls out half a dozen hairs at a time, but it really does work.  You won&#x27;t even need a mirror - you will feel the results immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought the spring about a month ago.  I watched the instructional demonstration on Youtube.com.  I tried it on my upper lip.  The spring grabbed the hairs I couldn&#x27;t see......it hurt but effective.  I was pleasantly pleased with the results.  I recommended this to my friends who have more facial hair than me.</li>
    <li> i wouldnt recommend this to anybody because it does not work at all and it hurts so so bad.i didnt like it at all</li>
    <li> I was unable to get it to work. Pehaps my facial hair is to blame, but I couldn&#x27;t see that a single hair was removed. Perhaps it could have been accompanied by instructions!</li>
    <li> Not sure which is most disappointing, the spring or the seller.  Seller claimed this product is better than the REM Spring so I purchased 3 springs and expected great results.  I have the REM Spring, but this spring was cheaper.  I planned to give as gifts and keep one for myself in my purse.  When the springs arrived I tried mine and discovered it is a very poor imitation of a great idea.  I contacted seller December 12. I wanted to return springs because they were not as a described (didn&#x27;t work).  As of January 8, this seller has not contacted me.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  Buy the REM Spring if you want great results.  Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.  I will never purchase a different spring other than the REM and I don&#x27;t intend to purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This one comes all the way from China. The rolls are not tight enough to remove hair. I tried pushing the tool together as much as I could, then roll. It worked only a little. There is a difference between these cheap ones...don&#x27;t bother</li>
    <li> This tool is painful to use. If you do not have a high pain tollerance you will not be able to use this product. It does what it is suppose to. quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Product works alright, but could be better. Took some practice and some YouTube research to learn to us it. I&#x27;ll mostly stick with wax and tweezers, but this will be kept for a rainy day.</li>
    <li> Of course it hurts, it&#x27;s ripping out hairs! Just not the dark hairs that I&#x27;m trying to pull.</li>
    <li> This little thing really works, even pulls out the fine hairs; its hurts, but beauty is pain.</li>
    <li> No Idea how to use this product...arrived as just a spring,no packaging, no direction..waste of money..what was the point of even sending it?</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended this product....&lt;br /&gt;Works great...not at all painful..reliable...easy to use...can carry anywhere...and  the price is super awsome as well.</li>
    <li> Silly to have to roll &amp; move it at same time.  Does work in a limited fashion, but only on soft fuzzy hair.  No comparison to a depilatory imo</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what expected, but I didn&#x27;t think it would be so painful, you can literally feel every single little hair pulling very slow. I never used it again after the first time but I bought it because I wanted to try it out. Waxing is the better less painful solution.</li>
    <li> Had bought this product before and misplaced it. Had to have another because they work so well.</li>
    <li> Great pricing and item arrived quickly.  Not sure what we expected but definitely not any better than simple tweezers.  This thing pinches and hurts worse each time, regardless where on the body its used...</li>
    <li> Did not work. I tried this product several times without success. I would not advice purchasing this item to anyone.</li>
    <li> It grabs the hair but when you go to pull then out it doesn&#x27;t pull them out.</li>
    <li> I use this for my mustache and while it is painful it is fast and easy to use.</li>
    <li> review of facial hair remover&lt;br /&gt;it seems to just pull the hairs but not remove them &amp; that was it&#x27;s purpose</li>
    <li> I did not like this, I did think this was what I had ordered since I have one similiar to this.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t work.  I watched the tutorial, but it didn&#x27;t help.  Will pull out a couple of hairs, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> My Spring It is almost my go-to for removing facial hair. Using only tweezers takes too long and lengthens the amount of time that you&#x27;re in pain, haha! If you haven&#x27;t tweezed or anything on your upper lip, boy, this is an eye-opener. The pain is almost akin to ripping your skin off. Okay, I exaggerate a little bit, but it still is really painful! My suggestion is to close your eyes and really quickly run the My Spring It til it pulls most of the hairs out. They&#x27;ll be gone in no time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, it seems to have trouble getting the hairs around the corners of the mouth, so I suggest you do the most you can on the upper lip then tweeze the remaining hairs. It&#x27;s not too bad to tweeze just those areas since you&#x27;ve already done a majority of it with the My Spring It.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgot to mention what is inside! The package includes simply the My Spring It and some instructions like how to use it, clean it, etc.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cheek and facial hair, but even using this the EXACT way you&#x27;re supposed to, this spring breaks the hair above the lip and creates STUBBLE!</li>
    <li> It gets the job done. The reason I give it a 4 is because it takes out more hair than anything I&#x27;ve used, but it does hurt like a bitch. I imagine I&#x27;ll get used to it once I do it enough (just like tweezing the eyebrows, hurts at first then you get used to it) Also it doesn&#x27;t remove everything and I find myself going over the same place a few times. But like I said, works better than anything I&#x27;ve used so far though. So it&#x27;s worth the buy and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> Pay more for the higher quality. I bought this to see if there was a difference between my expensive one and this cheaper version. There is a huge difference. I have bought. The spring is different. The cheap one has a bigger diameter metal tige and the coil is also bigger. Not as effective and not as comfortable. Spend more money and get the better quality one. I have had the Bellabe for a year now and it is still in great condition and works great. I clean it with a rubbing alcohol spray and no rust or other decay as of yet. Very happy with my Bellabe.I am not a worker for Bellabe nor do I get anything out of this review. Just the truth.</li>
    <li> Naaa. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> At first I didnt know how to use it but after a while i got the hang of it. Its painful but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well on the face. Takes a Lil getting used to and it kinda hurts too but once you get the hang of it. You will love it!</li>
    <li> This product works good at catching hairs. It is a little painful but you quickly get used to it. It does sometimes break hairs if you try to rush it so be careful! I do recommend this. Just make sure not to pull on the spring!!!! My sister accidentally yanked it from my hands because I didn&#x27;t realize she was grabbing it. It cause the spring to stretch out and it wouldn&#x27;t go back. I had to throw it away because once it&#x27;s stretched, it won&#x27;t grab hairs.</li>
    <li> I got this and had no idea how to use it. For me it doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything at all. What a waste of my money. Don&#x27;t even bother buying it.</li>
    <li> The spring did not pull the hair out as promoted but cut the hair very short. I would rather shave.</li>
    <li> I did like this product a lot but one of the pink handles popped off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m carefully following the directions that came with the product and looking at the pictures of how it&#x27;s used, but it&#x27;s not working for me. Maybe I&#x27;m just too uncoordinated or something.</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I used to pay someone else $5 every time I needed my upper lip threaded, so the MySpring It paid for itself x2 the first time I used it.  Rad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched this (or similar product) on YouTube to figure out how to best use - it took me maybe a minute, and it was easy to learn.  I have a relatively high threshold for pain, and if I had the rate the pain on a scale of 1-to-10 (10 being the highest), I would say this rated a 7 (eek).  Pain is very short-lived, though, and lessened over repeated use.</li>
    <li> This thing hurts like crazy and it&#x27;s really cheap. It still does the job for it&#x27;s intended purpose. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is that you have to go over an area again and again to get the hairs out in that area. It doesn&#x27;t have a wide range for pulling hairs in a single twist.</li>
    <li> It hurts but it gets the hair off :)</li>
    <li> I love this thing; although it hurts at first but then I just get used to the pain and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore. I actually hate waxing my upper lip because I feel like my hair has become so coarse that it doesn&#x27;t always work when I use wax. This thing works very well considering the price.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy another one when this one eventually breaks.</li>
    <li> This spring gets the facial hair out by the root well and makes my skin smooth. It does sting a little so do it quickly.</li>
    <li> It is new to me. That is nice. I will try it someday.  I hope it is work for it.. Have nice a day.</li>
    <li> These really work, but you don&#x27;t need to bend them into a U shape.  All you have to do is roll one over the area that you want to treat.  Be forewarned that it does hurt.  Also be forewarned that the shipping is on the level of &amp;#34;slow boat from China.&amp;#34;  Really.</li>
    <li> Works fine, hurts, but it works. Effective</li>
    <li> Sure it&#x27;s a bit painful, but like most women who have come to know that with beauty/vanity comes a little pain (which is why I am very low maintenance ! ) Tried EVERYTHING you can think of for my unwanted and unsightly facial hair issue which on certain days and depending on my mood evoked negative self consciousness, anyway&lt;br /&gt;some products and/or methods worked better than others but this by far was and has been the most natural AND effective and with the extremely low price of this product just topped it off.</li>
    <li> It works, but is rather tedious to use. But I&#x27;d rather use something that costs as little as this, than pay the high price of the electronic devices.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t understand how to use it at first because it didn&#x27;t come with instructions. I looked at videos for similar products but the actresses don&#x27;t show it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is how you use it: Hold each pink end (the knobs), then stretch the spring out. Place the stretched spring on an area on your skin where you wish to rid hair of. Stop stretching the spring &amp; it will compress, which then traps, or tweezes, the hair follicles between each spring coil. Next, roll upward (or downward) &amp; it will pull the hair out. That&#x27;s it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works best for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it gave amazing results! For under $2! Wayyyy better than tweezing one by one by hand.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work on my face, it just make my skin red.</li>
    <li> i bought this to remove hair off my arse. and it does agreat job,hasta lavesta baby. see you lator gator</li>
    <li> This is okay for the price but most definitely NOT  better than R.E.M.&lt;br /&gt;The first plus is of course the cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;The second plus is the large knobs at each end which makes it easier to hold on to and turn as you are supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;The first minus is the size of the coil itself. It is rather large diameter and just doesn&#x27;t grab the chin hairs like REM does.&lt;br /&gt;The second minus is how stiff the coil is.  It is difficult to get it bent into the proper U shape necessary to grab hair, and difficult to keep bent in that shape while twisting and rolling it as you need to do in order for it to perform its job.</li>
    <li> These did remove the hairs and works great, but the only thing I hate is that it hurts on the first time but if you could take the pain then go ahead :) and after you keep using them they won&#x27;t hurt as much plus its cheap so buy it !</li>
    <li> This product HURTS, and it doesn&#x27;t deliver good hair removal at all!  Steer clear of this product.  OUCH! NO GOOD!</li>
    <li> TOOK A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE IT BUT ITS EASY TO USE AND WORKS WELL....NOT TOO PAINFULL, MUCH LESS THAN PAIN THAN WAXING...GLAD I GAVE IT A TRY....WILL BUY AGAIN</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, but hurts a LOT to use on the upper lip.  Probably fine if you have a high pain tolerance!</li>
    <li> Love this product.... super cheap, super fast shipping.... and it is exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t say how much it hurts though.... other than that.... It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Like every other woman, I have unwanted facial hair. I bought this item and honey it works, no doubt about it. It is slightly painful when you start to use it but the more you thread the less you feel the pain. I do this every night before I go to sleep to make sure the hair doesn&#x27;t come back. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Got this right at estimated time. Exactly like the picture and it does function. However, there&#x27;s a trick to the angle and how you twist the ends, so I can see how some people frustrate or give up in the first few tries. It does sting a bit, but if you normally just wax or twease it&#x27;s no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;Just experiment a bit with it. Everybody has a different face structure so you might have to angle it differently to work. There are some nice people on YouTube that shows how they do it. Search &amp;#34;bellabe tutorial&amp;#34;  ~hope it helps</li>
    <li> HURTS WORSE THEN WAXING OR THREADING AND LEAVES BEHIND A BUNCH OF HAIR. THATS WHY IT&#x27;S ONLY $11 ! I DO NOT RECOMMEND ESP. TO PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN</li>
    <li> Works great. Saved lots of money on waxing strips after this.</li>
    <li> Does not work well, has little control</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE, hurts, and doesn&#x27;t pull hair out, pure torture</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve edited this review several times. I just didn&#x27;t know how to use it at first. Now that I do, it&#x27;s one of my favorite things I&#x27;ve ever bought on Amazon. I use it every 2 or 3 days for 20 to 30 seconds. That&#x27;s less than a minute per week, less than an hour in an entire year. And all for one low price. I was gone for Thanksgiving for 5 days, and forgot to bring it. But when I got home and used it again, there had been very little hair growth. It&#x27;s just the usual little mustache that we women grow, especially after menopause. Yes, it hurt a little the first time, but now that it&#x27;s just tiny hairs, it&#x27;s nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;ve learned how to use this correctly, I absolutely love it! It does hurt a little the first time, so I used an ice cube briefly to numb the area, dried my skin well, then proceeded. (Someone mentioned it will rust, so I&#x27;ve been very careful to keep it dry.) Now I use it for a minute or so every 2-3 days, before the hair has a chance to grow in. It does get every single little hair, so there&#x27;s no problem getting the tiny new growth. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all at this point. It&#x27;s extremely easy to use now that I&#x27;ve learned how. Just bend it as in the picture, turn  the ends inward together, and it will move up your skin, grabbing every hair on the way. I don&#x27;t even need a mirror. I have sensitive skin, but have no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waxing is messy, and you have to let the hair get long enough to work. It never got it all, either. Depilatories burn my skin before they&#x27;ve removed any hair. I wish I&#x27;d found this years ago, but from now on, this is the only kind of hair remover I will use. I don&#x27;t know why it says it lasts 6 months to a year. Maybe because it will fill up with hair. But it seems you could stretch it a bit briefly and blow it out. One last reason to love Myspring It. It&#x27;s cheap!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 3rd time I&#x27;ve edited this review. I gave it 3 stars at first, because I wasn&#x27;t using it right, as there are no instructions included. That&#x27;s still my only con, but it&#x27;s a big one. I had missed the part about the video.ructions included. That&#x27;s still my only con, but it&#x27;s a big one. I had missed the part about the video.</li>
    <li> This is a good invention, but I find it difficult to use.  I have a hard time using my left hand due to a motor vehicle accident.  You need both hands to work properly to make this item effective.  Sad to report, but  I don&#x27;t think I will be able to reap the benefits.  I thought I&#x27;d give this item a try; too bad it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it as I should but it is doing only half work</li>
    <li> Takes awhile to get use to the feeling but I love these!!</li>
    <li> Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap&lt;br /&gt;No harm in trying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Does not really remove all the hairs, I tries it for upper lips area.&lt;br /&gt;Very time consuming for starters.&lt;br /&gt;Not really using this product</li>
    <li> I think this is a great tool.  It&#x27;s going to take some practice to use it fully.  At first I couldn&#x27;t get any hair to come out of my chin.  With some quick practice it was working fine.  Much more hair comes out then with a traditional tweezer.</li>
    <li> buy it! it does not cause your face to break out.  best little invention. i prefer the smaller size .</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good price tho and works really well the first few months.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed my foundation went on smoother after using this on my face.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work well, difficult to manipulate especially if trying to use on upper lip, and it hurt like heck.</li>
    <li> Sorry to say, this did not work for me at all. It pulled at the hair but did not pull it out.</li>
    <li> Maybe its just me, but I could not get to pull out any hairs. S&lt;br /&gt;This will be another toy for the cat.....</li>
    <li> Close to what I thought . I&#x27;m not disappointed . Thanks</li>
    <li> Plucks very well.  Not for those who can&#x27;t handle a little pain.  Only qualm is how do I clean the inside?!  The tiny hairs are taped inside and I have no  how to remove them;  if you try to pry the springs apart,  you risk breaking the springit.</li>
    <li> This product took weeks to arrive, had Asian symbols on the packaging bag with no English translation, included ZERO instructions on how to use it.  I tried to use it anyway and it broke my skin.</li>
    <li> After seeing reviews that told of a lot of pain, I was hesitant, but I figured if I used hot water first to open the pores it would be better.  When It came I deided to try it dry first.  It worked great and I am now wondering about the pain thresshold of others.  No worse than tweezers, only it works so quickly, that there is less pain.  Come on ladies, ... \\&quot;Man up\\&quot;.  This is great.  No more hair.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how easy it was to remove my post menopausal peach fuzz! Yeah it stung at first on the upper lip but I was determined to get my face back. After a few minutes the pain passed and I was hooked. My face is smoothe and I feel years younger.</li>
    <li> product works ok, a bit hard to figure out since it comes with no instructions but it does work. a bit painful too but it does its job well, specially considering it&#x27;s such a low price</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing. It hurts, oh yes, it hurts. But don&#x27;t most hair removal products hurt? I would equate it with tweezing and at least this goes faster. It really works well. Google a how to video and then put on a TV show and go to town. The only thing I am disappointed in is that the hair grows back faster than I would have expected. But maybe I am just a freak. Don&#x27;t hem and haw over this decision - it&#x27;s only a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> Does not work  Very cheap</li>
    <li> Yes, it comes from China (took 3 weeks). Yes, it hurts a bit to use, especially on the upper lip. But let&#x27;s face it, even waxing is its own exquisite, eye-watering pain... But this very inexpensive tool works. My lip and chin are as smooth as when I get waxed. And no red bumps or skin rash! I keep it near my sofa and run it over my lip and chin once a week while watching TV. I&#x27;m finally a fur free girl without needing to leave the house and shell out too many dollars.</li>
    <li> Gets all the hair off! Easy to use on the face but difficult on eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Finally a gizmo that gets those stubborn hairs that resisted even tweezers. I followed the advice of other reviewers to get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to getting this based on the reviews. It came today and when I started using it the spring came out of the ends. I might try to super glue it because I&#x27;d like to try it again. I wish they would have included instructions with it.</li>
    <li> Works nicely, a bit painful if you want to use it around the mouth but no pain for using it on the cheeks or eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This spring works really well.I bought it to use on my upper lip hair. It just pulls the hair out like tweezers though, you could just use tweezers instead and save yourself the money and the stinging pain.</li>
    <li> At this price, I am glad I got the tool, as it is way more effective on the fine blond hairs at the corner of my mouth than tweezers ever were.  It quickly rips out the majority of them (enough of them that I don&#x27;t mind what remains; I just don&#x27;t want to look whiskery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to use AND less effective on the chin, although I find that holding it nearly straight when rolling on the chin makes it more grabby for those super-fine hairs.  The multiple rolls there to try to get any hairs lead to lots and lots of infected hair folicles and/or zits.  (This is a little bit of a problem by the mouth as well but not as bad.)  It also created this problem on a little portion of cheek I tried to use it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wiped it down with rubbing alcohol/witch hazel and only used it after cleaning my face.  So I&#x27;m being hygenic.  But somehow the pinching action--perhaps especially if it partially gets a hair but not by the root or if it grabs some bare skin--causes this very notable issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From here on out I will only use this on the corners of my mouth and will only do one or two swipes every week or several days as to minimize how much I irritate follicles and pores.  I will be glad to have it for that purpose, but I&#x27;m frustrated that it causes so many skin problems and cannot be used on my chin very efficaciously (and yes I did watch a lot of instructional videos).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.--It comes from China and does take a pretty long time to arrive.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s essentially the same as tweezing, but you get much more done in one shot. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back darker, which I was worried about.  It hurts. But, like tweezing, you get used to it. At first I put some ice on my upper lip so I wouldn&#x27;t feel it as much, but I don&#x27;t need to do that anymore. I&#x27;m not good with pain so my eyes water quite a bit and I can&#x27;t use it for too long. My skin gets red, but that goes away quickly.  A big con is that it&#x27;s so difficult to control what hairs you wanna remove. I can&#x27;t get the spring to catch most of the ones I want gone, so I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.  Soo...if you just have a couple hairs (not around eyebrows) and don&#x27;t want to wax, I definitely recommend this to you. For the hairs it doesn&#x27;t grab, use a tweaser. But for most of us, I think waxing is just about the only way to go. &gt;:S  Note: I don&#x27;t hate this product, I&#x27;m still using it because it&#x27;s so convenient. Just wish it worked better!</li>
    <li> It came in time and it works great. The spring size is at the top of the size scale. Having a smaller spring both in diameter and in length would work a little better in smaller places.</li>
    <li> I would never use this item or recommend it to any one else.  It was cheap and only had directions in Japanese.  There was not one word in English at all.</li>
    <li> This is just a spring, is doesn&#x27;t work at all. What a joke The instructions are in Japanese, I a rip off from the start. I mean it took me, three days to figure out that one must two an wrap the floss the spring.</li>
    <li> It really works!  It&#x27;s a bit painful until you start doing it a while, then you kind of get used to it.  I love it!</li>
    <li> When I first tried MySpring It, I thought, \\&quot;wow, I must have a high pain tolerance -- this really doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad at all!\\&quot;  Then I decided to go to Youtube and find a video on using it.  I saw that you should bend it slightly and roll it up your face (your thumbs will be moving downward).  Ouch!!!  Guess my pain tolerance wasn&#x27;t as good as I thought!  But it&#x27;s not unbearable, just ALMOST unbearable, lol.  I&#x27;m still using it though, because it works.  I don&#x27;t do well with wax (breaks out my face) and I don&#x27;t want to shave or use depilatories because I&#x27;m worried about stubble.  With this gadget, you pretty much have to go over the area several times, but you can see the little hairs sticking in the spring so you know it&#x27;s getting them off your face.  Plus, you can feel them coming out:)  I&#x27;ve only had the MySpring It for a few days, so I&#x27;m hoping it gets less painful like everyone says.  But even if it doesn&#x27;t, I will continue to use it because it&#x27;s better than a hairy face!</li>
    <li> Im pregnant and my somewhat hairy chin has now become a forest!  The only way to rid myself of these black hairs was weekly waxing, yes, I said weekly.  However the hot wax was reeking havoc on my skin, until now!  I love, LOVE this product.  I have been using it over a month.  Whenever I have the need to get rid of facial hair I just use it sitting in bed at night and it works incredibly well!  No more wax, or hours of tweezing.  Honestly this product is an answer to prayer, I&#x27;ve got to stock up so I will have this perfect tool for the rest of my life!  Note:  I&#x27;ve done laser hair removal for 2 yrs., electrolysis, epilator, sugaring, waxing, cream hair removal.  Of everything I have used to remove my unwanted dark chin hair, this is by far the most cost efficient, convenient and dependable way to remove hair. Thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> The MySpringIt is awesome!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier! I am definitely going to buy this again! (I would recommend buying them from different companies because their quality can vary widely. I ordered from 2 different companies and am more impressed with one over the other. Shop around a bit... :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this after watching a You Tube video.  It works OK, but not great.  Chin hair removal is not too bad, but upper lip hurts like the dickens!  I suppose it&#x27;s worth the small price I paid but glad I didn&#x27;t pay more.</li>
    <li> This thing works, for $1.51 it&#x27;s amazing. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work reading some of the previous reviews but when I saw the price I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;hey why not? It&#x27;s only $1.51&amp;#34; nothing too pricey. If it didn&#x27;t work oh well it was only $1.51 because I know there are some other sellers that sell it for much more like $12 or something. So I thought this was a good deal. Before I use to shave or wax my upper lip, but I was tired of going to the salon and getting a facial wax for $5 with tip and I was tired of shaving since the razor doesn&#x27;t shave my upper lip properly. Which made me turn to another alternative this. I saw bubzbeauty use it and I needed it because it saved me money not to wax, it also does a much better job than shaving. It did hurt at first but you get use to it. I do recommend it! :)</li>
    <li> It took a little while and some patience to get this to work. Thanks for all your reviews! Without them I would have just given up. This silly looking thing really works! And - Once you get it to work,  then it is easy to do. Read the reviews for tips on technique.  As time goes on: I keep ordering more as gifts for my friends. Once I show them how to use it, they are delighted, and end up ordering some for their friends.</li>
    <li> My facial hair is very coarse and when I used it pulled some of the hairs but not much. It is a little painful and wasn&#x27;t very different from plucking.</li>
    <li> I was scared to use it at first, cause people complained it hurt a lot on the the upper lip and chin  (which is what I wanted it for). But...its doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  Maybe I&#x27;m good with pain but this for me is sooo much better then my hair removal creme. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin or irritate it. Does turn red at first but goes away after a few minutes. I will say my spring it didn&#x27;t come with instrusctions at all....but that&#x27;s why we have the internet and of course youtube. They show u exactly how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other then the instructuons not coming with the product the spring it works great! My chin and upper lip feel so smooth and finally no burning! This is a great buy for a great price!</li>
    <li> This did not work for me or my daughter. Pulled the hair but did not remove the hair. This thing is a joke!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and so far, so good.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It is fantastic for removing hair and sooooo easy. For the price, it is a steal. It shipped so fast im thinking about buying more for family and friends. LOVE it and awesome service from the seller!!</li>
    <li> works great, hurts some but all hair removing products hurt..easy to take while traveling..arrived early, seems sturdy so far, not messy</li>
    <li> Hurts like hell and it&#x27;s kinda hard to get the hang of it because the instructions are in Chinese.</li>
    <li> Worth the price!! It is a great tool and works fantastic. I do recommend the first time you use it on your lip to numb it just a little and do it often to get rid of the pain. Do not get scared. It is like waxing and plucking- the first time you are in pain but after that it is a breeze.</li>
    <li> Get the original one, R.E.M.  This one is cheap, made in China (do those two statements really need to be separated?), and is really only good for touch ups on the run.  Just got this as a backup for in the car.  Typical cheap &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; item.  Not completely useless, but I wouldn&#x27;t spend more than $6 or $7 on this.  The R.E.M is worth more and is better quality.  I should have actually just got two of those instead.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to use and it is somewhat painful but the end result is it does work. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Think twice before you buy and use this cheap too on your face!&lt;br /&gt;They post a false information you should know about before you buy this tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My spring it:  is NOT made of 100% stainless steel, which can NOT be cleaned with alcohol, will rust and catches bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;Steel contains nickel which is chemical, when it comes in contact with the skin especially facial, It can hurt the skin badly.&lt;br /&gt;More than that, the handles that made of plastic, catches bacteria you can&#x27;t wash away and when it comes in contact with heat, it melts and releases chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.E.M is made of 100% stainless steel which can be sterilized, can be cleaned with wet wipe and alcohol, will not rust and the&lt;br /&gt;spring itself goes through a special proses to neutralized the nickel and other bad chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;R.E.M is not the cheapest product out there, but the highest quality for sure with a design patent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to facial skin, look for the the highest quality, not for the cheapest.</li>
    <li> But it HURTS LIKE HELL! The first 5min was crazy. It took a lot for me to not cry and scream. Now, after that its better-tolerable. You just have to get past the first 5min, and it&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
    <li> sometimes it catches hair, sometimes not.  but overall, good for the price.  its&#x27; silly that I have to add 8 more words in to submit this.</li>
    <li> When you find out how to actually roll/pluck with this tool you will find tweezers are completely &amp;#34;old-school&amp;#34;. I would NOT suggest using this on your eyebrows but cheek/mustache/chin hair no longer exists with this device. It does hurt when you first use it, but it is very similar to when you use tweezers but much more effective.</li>
    <li> Mine came with only Japanese/Chinese(?) instructions. The pictures were cryptic. But the reviews here and the points to videos on YouTube helped. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, but I have some places on my chin where a few grow and they are very annoying. I can tweeze them, but there always seemed to be one or two that I could still feel if I stroked a finger along my chin (where I have a little scar, which is where the hair(s) like to grow. I even bought a very fine expensive tweezer to get at them. I tried this device rolling this way and that, curved and not, and finally figured out a method, because I could feel hairs being plucked. I also tried spreading the spring by pulling apart with the pick ends first before doing the twisting bit. This seems to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really amazed now. After playing round with it this evening my chin feels completely smooth, even the places where it did not before even with my special tweezers and big magnifying glass. So I give it 5 stars for results. But you do have to practice with it to figure out the best method for you. Simply rolling did not do it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I have had threading done on my brows. This is comparable, but I am only doing a few hairs on my chin, not my brows. I don&#x27;t consider it painful.</li>
    <li> Still figuring out how to use it.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than other brands and works just as well</li>
    <li> Not the best for people who have more thicker hair.</li>
    <li> This is painful to use and, I must admit, I haven&#x27;t used it more than once because of the pain.  The hair I need to remove is on my chin which is sensitive with or without warming the area with hot/warm water.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get to the pain and use it like others who recommended it.  It honestly isn&#x27;t more painful than tweezing.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for me, and I loved the price!</li>
    <li> PERFECT TOOL EVER!!!! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&amp; GOOD SERVICE TOO</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand the expectations people must have had for this little device. It works well and can be manipulated in fairly small areas but it isnt controlled by a wizard. If you want to shape your eyebrows like Anastasia, buy some flipping tweezers...or go to a salon. Also, it isn&#x27;t THAT painful. Tweezing seems more painful to me for sure...buncha whiney diva&#x27;s... It&#x27;s less than $2 including shipping. I just ordered 2 more in case I loose it. I like it.</li>
    <li> it does it job if you use it the right way. Not bad but I feel like the pink handle part of it will loosen and fall off soon.</li>
    <li> Great little tool - easy to use</li>
    <li> Hard to use at first, but works just like it described</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a faster way of removing all facial hair. It hurts a little bit at first but after a little while it&#x27;s not too bad. Also, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This silly thing works! I find myself shouting ouch with every &amp;#34;roll&amp;#34; but the little bit of pain is worth getting all the hair off my face. After using it, I just pat my face with a cold wet wash cloth. Then I apply moisturizer.  I knew that it would be &amp;#34;ouchy&amp;#34; because other people have said so, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge surprise and wasn&#x27;t enough to make me not buy it. I am just tired of using a razor on my face every  time I go somewhere, not that I have a BEARD but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s attractive for a woman to have hair on her face. But that&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> This item performs as advertised.  It took about 30 seconds to figure out how to hold it and which way to roll my fingers.  It definitely removes the fine hairs on your face.  Much faster and easier than plucking with tweezers.</li>
    <li> Works super well! Better than plucking in large areas.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! It is so easy to use, painless, and it is natural, no chemicals, or ripping of the skin. For me it doesn&#x27;t hurt because I used to thread and that hurt A LOT more! It is easy to use, although you do have to go over a section 2-3 times it actually works!! This is not to be used on the eyebrows!!! It comes in a nice case and I got a pink one. My mom loves it and I think I&#x27;m going to get her one. You don&#x27;t even need a mirror, although it is very helpful. I recommend you get this, it makes your skin so smooth afterwards and is much cheaper than waxing and threading. It removes hairs from the roots so that it will last longer. If you find it too painful you should try putting warm water on your face dry it off and then use it so it opens your pores. WOW.... AMAZING IS ALL I CAN SAY.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this tool! I keep one by my bed and one in my overnight bag. It&#x27;s a quick, easy and discreet way to remove unwanted facial hair. There&#x27;s no mess! It is a little uncomfortable the first few times you use it. I use it for just a minute or two everyday and find it painless. I can&#x27;t say enough about this handy, affordable little gadget. I will never be without one!</li>
    <li> I never have used a tool like this before, but waxing hard was on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Waxing always breaks my skin out, also even products advertised as extremely gentle\\&quot; still breaks me out.  This removes the fine aggravating hairs that started in my 40s.  I use this while watching tv and it is even somewhat enjoyable after you sort of get used to using this tool.  I have no other tools simular to this to compare to, or I might have even given it a 5.  I would reccomend this and I plan to purchase another when this one starts to wear out.</li>
    <li> yup love it. tend to only review something if I loved it or hated it. Its taking some practice, but I&#x27;m getting better at using it... so much better than tweasing because leaves a smoother feel like waxing since you get even teeny hairs. I use it on my chin! I&#x27;ve got blonde hairs mostly, so hard to twease..</li>
    <li> Once I figured out how to use it, it didn&#x27;t work that well at all.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have instructions but it works when I looked it up</li>
    <li> still trying to figure out how to use it, but when i get a hair i can feel it, which is what i want</li>
    <li> This from a girl that has waxed her upper lip since HIGH SCHOOL! At the rate I was going, I could have been a wolfman movie double by the time I was 50.  For 30 years, I have suffered chemical burns from delapitory creams/acids, burns from wax, those weird little mosquito bite bumps from wax.  I have tried hot wax, cold wax, wax strips and stripless wax.  I have shaved (oh the horrors of that), tweezed, plucked, picked and prayed.  But that nightmare hair continued to plague me.  I have had electrolysis (it grew back) and didn&#x27;t even bother with the laser situation as paying that much and living through the frustration of the regrowth would have made me nuts.  I was actually researching the NO NO when I came across this little gadget. After reading the reviews on the NO NO, I felt the same about it as I did the laser.  Maybe it worked for a few, but the general consensus was bleak.  Oh sadness.  I was ready to put that baby on my Christmas list.  And waiting 6 weeks for results was not hopeful.  I&#x27;m not great at commitment like that.&lt;br /&gt;I ran across the MySpringIt and noticed that it had 4+ stars and was intrigued.  I think I payed less than five bucks for it and thought, \\&quot;hey, for five bucks, I&#x27;ll give it a shot\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed at the ease, effectiveness and thoroughness of this magic wand.  Yes, it smarts a TINY bit.  Yes it takes a few minutes to really get going with it as you have to figure out how to hold it to keep the right angle- but it took me minutes to figure out after reading the other reviews.  And my entire face is under control.  Chin, upper lip and jawline all smooth and clean.  And no icky sticky wax spots to scrub off with lotion or whatever else I can find that will dissolve it (once I had to use goo gone on my face to get it off. gross).&lt;br /&gt;And I read my email while I did it.  What a cool multi tasker!&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product high enough.  For the price, the value and the freedom from the damaging alternatives, I give it a 6.But they will only let me give it a 5.</li>
    <li> Awesome tool! My Myspring It came 4 weeks after I placed the order...It also hurts A LOT at first.</li>
    <li> This product is so stupid.  I wouldn&#x27;t give it one star but you can&#x27;t post without it.  The thing is suppose to rip your facial hairs out.  Yep, it really hurts.  So dumb.  What was I thinking?</li>
    <li> Beauty is pain!:) satisfied does its job removing any facial hair problem. Took awhile to get here, but worth the wait.</li>
    <li> It takes a great amount of time and twechnique to get this product to even pinch the hairs.  To much work.</li>
    <li> absolutely hated this item. very difficult to use and when i finally got the hang of it the hair remained. not impressed at all</li>
    <li> Not sure about this tool yet..I may need more practice...I still prefer waxing...</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. It is a very good quality spring. Too good. So good that it picked up nothing as the coils were so tight.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it does the best job of getting all of the tiny hairs, but it does pull some. This also hurts to use around the lip area!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This is such a great find! If you&#x27;re like me I hate waxing but unfortunately it&#x27;s something I have to do. I love to take spring threader everywhere I go. I have one at work, in my purse,at home and in the car! It&#x27;s so inexpensive. And it actually pulls the hair out from the root! Not just cutting it off like the epilator. I have already gifted this to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> Dont like it at all. It pulls ur hair out n it hurts, I have trybit a few times hoping ill get used to it but it still hurts.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work quite well, but really be prepared for pain. It&#x27;s not like plucking or waxing- more like the feeling of threading. But it works really well, and removes the hair in one or two sweeps if used correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it hurts. Like really.</li>
    <li> So easy to use. It does hurt at first but is a lot easier than waxing or tweezing embarrassing upper lip hairs.</li>
    <li> The only difference that I can see between this and Spring Facial Hair Removal tool is that it has Chinese written all over the package.  The notice said I would not receive until the middle/end of May!  I didn&#x27;t understand that but it came within a week.&lt;br /&gt;I so loved the first one that I ordered two of these one to give to my sister and one to put in my suitcase.  Now when traveling I don&#x27;t have to pack my heavy magnifing mirror for plucking.......the old commercial jingle ..oh, what a relief it is.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product from a youtube makeup guru and thought I&#x27;d try it. Just wanted to tell everyone that it&#x27;s SUPER easy to use, great for upper lip hair removal! Plus, it&#x27;s FUN to use!</li>
    <li> 100% useless waste of money and time!  This do-icky wasn&#x27;t worth the few cents I paid for it, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay over $5.00 for it! It would take about 100 hours to pluck 10 facial hairs with this thing! One star because it was priced less than $5.00!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Not for me at least.  A waste of money and how many more words do you need for me to express that?</li>
    <li> This tool is great at removing very fine hairs; but the hair I wanted removed, the longer, darker, coarse ones, those it leaves behind.</li>
    <li> I just received mine yesterday - my review for the item is 4 stars, because it does do what it says- it works! unfortunately though, It honestly hurts like hell! but beauty is pain right? lol I dealt with it! I&#x27;m not that pleased with the seller- others have said theirs came in a pretty pink case, mine didnt! it just looked like a toy pkg &amp; all Chinese writing on the back! good thing I read reviews &amp; was familiar with how to work it! the shipping was quick though.</li>
    <li> I bought this for facial hair and I&#x27;m glad it was as cheap as it was because i used it once and will never use it again. It is extremely painful and takes forever. I will stick to waxing.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine showed me a tool similar to this product made by a different manufacturer, it was wonderful, but this tool didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> Waste of money....it does not work at all and is just a way ti get people to spend money, Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on it.</li>
    <li> this device does exactly what is expected... of course there is some pain involved if to use without numbing cream but leaves my face free of unwanted hair. recommend!</li>
    <li> kind of hard to get the hang of it. it pulls some hairs out but you have to roll it just right and there are not good instructions with it.</li>
    <li> I loved it! Its a great product that works really well! It wont let you down! It does kinda hurt at first but you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product love it ....unlike tweezer u can pull hairs with no scarring....I wish I wouldve know about it ages ago!</li>
    <li> I used it, correctly.  This spring gave me bumps all over my face where the hair was pulled out.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I Love this product! although you do have to go over the hair a couple times, it does work well!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim because why not, it was cheap, and I thought it might be better than plucking. I would not recommend it. First of all, it is a Made in China piece of junk. Second, let me just tell you, if you have never used something like this before, it is going to hurt. I can only speak for myself, but in my 23 years of living, I have come to realize that tweezing is not that bad. My mantra has always been, &amp;#34;Beauty is pain,&amp;#34; and I live by that. This spring thing doesn&#x27;t deliver the kind of pain tweezing does, but after using it, I didn&#x27;t even feel like it worked.</li>
    <li> Weird to use at first, but its nicer than waxing my entire face. This totally makes a difference and you don&#x27;t waste or throw away anything!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all.  It&#x27;s just a regular spring with rubber tips on each end. It sucks.  Not worth purchasing even for less than $2.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised how well this thing actually works.  It&#x27;s a bit manual but the fine hairs on my chin and face take longer to grow back than if I used a razor.  Definitely better than R.E.M.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this device I could not even imagine how it could remove the hair on my chin and over my top lip but then I tried it...wow...it really does the trick.  I had to go over a couple of areas more than once, but it worked.  I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of waxing or tweezing and wants a quicker, more inexpensive way to remove face hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.Not worth the hassle and cost of returning it.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I would have liked it to remove a little more hair but it worked really good. It does hurt alot when you first use it but when you use it more you get used to it and it doesnt hurt as much. What I did the first time was put a popsicle over the area to numb it a little, that worked preety good.</li>
    <li> Ok product but difficult to use for single hairs.</li>
    <li> Broke within one second.  Cheap enough that I just threw it in the trash.  Nor was it in a sealed package - gross for a personal product.</li>
    <li> did not work well. Hurt like heck.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27; t do anything.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take the hair off</li>
    <li> For the price of 6.99 it did an ok job. I don&#x27;t think it was the brand it advertised. I give it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with this!...not for fine hair but for a beard or coarse long hair.  Does not grip well and broke after a few uses.  Don&#x27;t get your expectations up!</li>
    <li> I never owned something like this but I thought I could handle it.. nope! Haha! It works at getting hairs off, but I feel like you have to do a couple rounds to get enough off.. and considering I apparently have a low tolerance for facial pain, that was not an option for me.. I&#x27;ve honestly forgotten I owned it for the past couple months as it has been sitting in my drawer since I first tried it the couple times. Well made and fast delivery, though!</li>
    <li> I absolutely hate my lip hair and using lotions/wax irritates my skin and makes it look worse! I saw some reviews about the spring it which is like $15 but, I got this tool which is the exact same thing for only a couple of dollars! No more skin irritation, portable, quick, and easy too! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This contraption was ridiculous! I gave it as a Christmas gag gift and got great laughs. I would not recommend this product. I really did try it and it does not work!</li>
    <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money it does not work. The device is stupid and cheap looking don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to waxing and I found this. Glad I got it.. love how it gets all the small hair and doesn&#x27;t even hurt much :)</li>
    <li> Nice little product for it&#x27;s cost.  Initially it takes time to use and is seomehwat painful, but after a few days of diligence, it takes less time and pain.  I would recommend you use it at least everyday for a few seconds to keep up, or you start the process all over again.  So, for those who are not patient or little time to &amp;#34;groom&amp;#34; - it might not be for you.  I would prefer an electric remover, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay for it.  You do need to be coordinated to keep up the twisting motion while moving it over your face - that&#x27;s my personal 2-star rating - not the fault of the product.</li>
    <li> Product was well described, and works well.  Would recommend to a friend.  I have sensitive skin and this works well for me.</li>
    <li> Great tool. Quick delivery!</li>
    <li> It works for very fine facial hair that I call peach fuzz.  It feels a bit like having the area waxed when you pull the hair off but in a smaller area.  After a while you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Much better than plucking, in my opinion! I was nervous about getting this product as it is one of the less expensive ones I found, but it works great. I used it on my upper lip, cheeks and chin and it is fast, effective and less painful than waxing or plucking, in my opinion. It&#x27;s much faster than threading.</li>
    <li> Works great! To bad my skin is too sensitive. Makes me break out.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was just as good as the R.E.M. Spring since I was researching these spring products online.  Since this was such a deal, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to at least try it.  It works great!!  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!  It is quick and easy (with a little pain the first time).  You just hold the tool in an upside down U shape and twist your fingers outward (and keep twisting).  The twisting outward motion pulls out the hair.  I mostly purchased this product for some peach fuzz and it works great!  It is a little painful the first time but personally I thought waxing was worst.  At least with the spring, you can remove hair at your own pace.  I am now using it twice a week to maintain and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I liked it so much, I just purchased one for my mom as a gift!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s useful than I thought. It did a good job, it removal facial hair easily. and I like it very much!</li>
    <li> The title says it all! I could not find one word on the packaging that I could understand. I was going to scan the directions into a translator program, but figured too much hassle.</li>
    <li> pain is beauty. saw it on a video and decided to try it...&lt;br /&gt;pulling facial hair like no tomorrow and works how i expect it to work.</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay.  But not for thick hair.</li>
    <li> It does take the hair out bt it made me break out alott for some reason and i hate it</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know exactly how to use it but I watched a video on youtube and that helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me keep my upperlip and chin clean which is a big deal for a person like me who has bigtime facial hair growth :(&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t help me with hair on my neck but I recently bought a makeup mirror from Amazon that helps magnify the surface and I can easily tweaze the neck hair out now..I think I am saving a lot on waxing/threading now .</li>
    <li> this isn&#x27;t so great - doesn&#x27;t work very good for me</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here-my fault did not realize it was coming from the Orient. Need to either practice using it or give up.</li>
    <li> This just rolls around my hair but doesn&#x27;t pull them. I suppose if you have very thick and long hair, it may be effective but, if that&#x27;s the case, one would still most likely be more successful using a wax. No good for fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Completely stupid. I won&#x27;t use it after I&#x27;ve bought it. You roll it over your unwanted hairs and move your hands back and forth so the spring comes open and closed to PAINFULLY catch hairs which only grabs a few at a time. Go buy a razor or tweezers TRUST ME! You&#x27;ll save yourself a lot of time and won&#x27;t be in as much pain!! Classify this under one of the worst gimmick products EVER!</li>
    <li> Horrible. You are better off waxing or buying the finishing touch. This just hurts and leaves pimples. It breaks the hair off, nothing like tweezing. Maybe you need to be skilled to use this, but this is a waste of money and full of pain and discomfort! Do not buy this!</li>
    <li> Had to roll a few times (four, five times), but it works. Faster than tweezing. Doesn&#x27;t hurt too much; sort of tickles.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this for my peach fuzz. The first time i used this, i was literally in tears because I&#x27;ve never waxed, tweezed, or threaded there. The pain was really bad but i didn&#x27;t want to walk around with a half shaved so i finished the rest- which took forever since i kept pausing- and my face looked better overall. The first time hurts the worst but you get used to it after a while. I use it once a week and tweeze the really small hairs left over. The will be some redness afterwards but it&#x27;ll go down. If you have irritation, discontinue use. Word of advice, watch a lot of Youtube videos on how to use products like this. BEAUTY IS PAIN</li>
    <li> I wanted to remove some very fine peach fuzz on the side of my face. This spring couldn&#x27;t catch any of it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have anything good to say about this product.  It HURTS...I mean seriously, OUCH!!  I will continue to make appointments for threading.  I thought this could tie me over between appointments, but I can&#x27;t bare the pain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very painful and barely removes and hair. But it does take some hair off. I guess I just need to practice.</li>
    <li> I like it but it&#x27;s hurt a little bit</li>
    <li> I bought this because i&#x27;m pregnant and I feel like i&#x27;m growing a beard.... I didn&#x27;t want to have to go have it waxed every other week so i thought i would try this. But i wasn&#x27;t impressed. It doesn&#x27;t grab all of the hairs, and the few it grabs doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> i have tried lots of hair remover tricks tequniqes and items but I really have never seen one work this well it removed multiple hairs at once and didn&#x27;t even hurt as if you where to remove one I love the product so much highly recommended</li>
    <li> useless. Thank Gawd it was only .99¢</li>
    <li> I needed to get rid of some facial hair, so I decided to try this product. Since your face is so sensitive, pulling the hairs out still hurts, especially from the upper lip. Also, sometimes it does not pull the stubborn hairs from the root, and instead just breaks them, so if you look closely, it looks like I have shaved. Still, not a bad product and I only have to do this once a week. I am trying this instead of threading, and I think I might like this better.</li>
    <li> This little gaget  works very well.  It gives the same affect as when you get threaded.  If your hairs on your face are thick or alot, when you use it .....it will hurt.  But once you get all the hairs off, if you use it every couple of days as a maintenance tool, it does not hurt.  You could even go and get waxed or threaded before you use it and then just maintain with this tool.  It is very convenient because you can use it whenever you need to and don&#x27;t have to go somewhere to get waxed or threaded.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work on me, hard to use, no description of usage.</li>
    <li> Its painful at 1st, however, it gets the job done! im actually shocked on how this product makes a difference. :)</li>
    <li> No Instructions.  Can&#x27;t get it to do any hair removal. Simply does not work. It is a simple tool, but since, I cannot get it to work, maybe I need instructions.</li>
    <li> MY WIFE &amp; MY DAUGHTER WANTED IT , THEY BOUGHT IT AND THEY LOVE IT , THEY WILL BUY IT LATER FOR THEIR FREINDS .</li>
    <li> I seen this product on QVC for around 20 dollars so I thought I would shop around. Found it on Amazon for around 2 dollars. BARGAIN...This spring works great. I mean you can feel it working. I love it and will be using it the rest of my life...LOVE LOVE LOVE...</li>
    <li> Not too sure how I feel about this</li>
    <li> Came in a nice bag. But overall, a bit difficult to use. Ended up not using it as often, but perhaps more practice would help.</li>
    <li> Unless you are in the mood for serious stinging pain, by pass this product. Sorry, don&#x27;t know what I expected, but didn&#x27;t think the process would hurt as much.</li>
    <li> My daughter ordered it for itself and last night tried, remained is very happy, even asked to order the second on a stock. I recommend!</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly!!! Feels like threading!!!</li>
    <li> This product is great. If you like using twesers its a great product for you. It hurts at the first use  but after awhile its less painful.</li>
    <li> Great tool... Seriously everyone should have one. It&#x27;s easy to use, but it  takes time to get used to it and figure out the angles. Works the best after a hot shower. I&#x27;m only giving it a 4 because a few hairs I still had to pluck, but it just might have been user error! I recommend you tubing a video on it to watch first</li>
    <li> The instructions were not in English and I attempted to use the product as shown in the picture, but it does not work.</li>
    <li> Worked great. It was a cheap fix to an old problem. Not painless but at least its quick</li>
    <li> This works, but it broke me out in tiny little bumps.  I had to stop using it. Arrived on time and good quality,  just was not for me.</li>
    <li> Takes a little time to learn technique but works, I use this for facial hair removal and can use it while watching tv no mirror needed.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> These are basically tweezers, and no instructions or anything</li>
    <li> have purchased similar items much cheaper would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Got before the expected delivery date.  I really like it saves me from tweezing.</li>
    <li> At first I was going to be upset because it didn&#x27;t come with instructions but then I looked under the comments and found great ones.. it works you actually can see a difference but it hurts</li>
    <li> it surpassed my expectations!</li>
    <li> At first I had a hard time, apparently I was rolling it in the wrong direction. This spring is fantastic. In a few minutes I&#x27;ve already pulled hundreds of hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I brave enough to try my bikini line? I might order another one while I work up the courage!</li>
    <li> After trying it a few times Ive decided that this item could of been better. It only works for one area on my face (the lip) everywhere else is very difficult. Pain isn&#x27;t too bad since I&#x27;m used to thredding.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to consistently pull hair. When it does grip hair it does work.</li>
    <li> I ordered this spring facial hair removal tool because my daughter has one.  I did try it.  It works, but is painful</li>
    <li> not as good as the one from the drug store I lost but works ok</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I expected, but I think I&amp;#34;m still in the learning curve using it. There were no directions, so I went by what I read in other reviews online. However it didn&#x27;t remove the sideburn hair that thought it would be easy to remove. I made amend this after I get more experience.</li>
    <li> this is great. i like the fact that no chemicals go to your face. I wish the spring is thinner. still this spring takes all the small pesky hairs you can have. i guess you have to get use to it bf judging it i took me like an hour to se  how by bending it ans twisting you can have a great job done!!</li>
    <li> This product gave me pimples/in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather have facial hair than pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in really fast though. For it&#x27;s cheap price, you could just but it and try it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work.  I could have used the tweezers and it would have worked better.  There is a more expensive one that may work like it is supposed to - but save your money and don&#x27;t get this one!</li>
    <li> Just okay hair removal -- not as good a hair remover as NoNo has proven itself to be where I am concerned</li>
    <li> I was getting to the point of considering laser hair removal on my upper lip because of all the dark hairs that kept constantly growing back.  For me, that&#x27;s kind of desperate.  Plucking just takes way too much time to do every day.  But my sister got the REM spring and brought it over for all of us women to try, and I found the answer to my problems!!  The REM spring is around $15-ish, though, and I try to save as much as I can.  So I figured I&#x27;d try this since it&#x27;s so cheap.  Voila!  I works just about as well as the REM spring.  I haven&#x27;t had it for very long, so who knows if it will have some durability issues later on, but for now, I&#x27;m satisfied. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not going to have to pay for waxing anymore!  This is perfect for hair in between the eyebrows and also around the lip area.</li>
    <li> Beauty is pain. I really love this spring. It works very well on the face and sideburns. however it does sting when you do it . but hey, it works and i don&#x27;t break out afterwords. I found that if i use it after a hot shower or just after washing my face it does not sting as bad :) and my first time using it was a little awkward but after i got the hang of it It really changed my life lol. I have recommended it to a few people i think they are just a little afraid because it does sting at first. its just like plucking a large area at one time . gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have hurt myself using it, the seller asked if I wanted a refund and all is fine, maybe it was my fault and I don&#x27;t know how to use it but I simply got a little bit of skin together with the hair when using it...</li>
    <li> This do not work..Don&amp;#34;t waist your money on this..not worth a penny..</li>
    <li> It is great and very effective. I have been using it lately and it really does get the hair out just that it is very painful</li>
    <li> Excellent Product. Wish I had found this years ago. I have sensitive skin and could not use hair removal creams. Waxing made me red and irritated. Had been using a sugaring wax product which was much better than regular wax but seemed to not get all the hair and pulled on my lip too much causing early wrinkles. Finally went for the NoNo. A Big NoNO. literally chewed my upper lip and very hard to use on upper lip. Sent Back. I saw this product on Youtube and was facinated and couldn&#x27;t wait to try. So happy I saw this product. Took the hair off upper lip every single hair so easily with no irritation whatsoever. So happy I found this product and would purchase again. Service from this seller was superb I received in just a few days and the price very reasonable. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try this you won&#x27;t be sorry. Check out a video online to see how to use it properly. It&#x27;s awesome. I won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> Loved it.It is cool ,I do recommend this product for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Less pain, no rashes or burns. The price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> Not working at all :(</li>
    <li> Was excited about this product, but found it too time consuming and kind of irritating when trying to remove hair.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work all that well. Still have to pluck.</li>
    <li> This is such a simple idea that works beautifully. I bought 4, one for me and my sister&#x27;s. I knew how to use it by watching a demonstration on You Tube. The product is from China and there is a picture on the back showing how but the demonstration on You Tube was very good. There was free shipping and I did have to wait for it&#x27;s arrival in the mail but it was worth it! I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I suppose this product did what it was supposed to, but i found that it would actually cut some of the hairs instead of pluck them out completely. The pain was moderate, as one might expect.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. For me, it is much easier than threading.</li>
    <li> I bought a few of these for my sisters, mom and I because they are so ridiculously cheap priced but I guess you get what you pay for. They didn&#x27;t grasp any hairs really. My mother and sisters had the same result as me. I will stick to buying the brand Bellabe even though they are way more expensive! I&#x27;m glad I tried these though, it was a learning experience for me.</li>
    <li> I can feel it grabbing all the hairs except the ones I want to get rid of - chin hairs. What am I doing wrong?</li>
    <li> This is not myspring it brand. It is a knock off. With that being said it does work and looks exactly like the original product. It came in a secure packaging with asian model and writing on it. Im not too dissapointed since i recieved the product in 3 days for $5 total includung shipping.</li>
    <li> Works great for the upper lip area, but is SO PAINFUL at first! I actually had tears in my eyes.  But I am getting used to it!  It&#x27;s a nice alternative to chemicals or waxing.</li>
    <li> I used this product as soon as it arrived. I have very fine hair on my upper lips, and it was very easy to pull them out with this tool. The directions to use are very simple. Does it hurt much? I didn&#x27;t think so, but pain is relative so you have to try it to see. At this price, it is totally worth getting one.</li>
    <li> Love it! Amazing tool and easy to use.</li>
    <li> It hurts a little but as time goes on and more use it gets easier, it does what it says.  Shipped fast as well!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> This was a great bargain. I can&#x27;t use it specifically as directed, but I can get it to work.</li>
    <li> Doesnt pull all the hairs out!</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! I got this apparatus and wondered what the heck am I suppose to do??? Well, It was a little painful, but not to bad. It works great. my face is as smooth as a babies face. My makeup goes on so much better, now I can look in the mirror and the are no little blonde hairs glistening back at me. I bought one for my friend too and she likes it too. This thing gets the hair out by the roots.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to purchase this one and see how I like it.  If it&#x27;s not too painful and proves to be effective, I will probably upgrade to the REM model.</li>
    <li> A little tricky to figure out at first but I like it!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. I used to go in for threading of my upper lip and chip every 2 weeks. Now I use this at home, usually when I&#x27;m watching tv. It works great. It&#x27;s painful at first but you get used to it. Saves me time and money.</li>
    <li> these broke 2.5 seconds after I took them out the package complete garbage don&#x27;t waste ur money</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waist your money on this!  :/</li>
    <li> I bought 5 of these! They work great. Takes a bit of use to get the knack of how to use it with great results. You do need to go over the same area a few - to several times. Fun to use while watching tv or riding in the car as a passenger. Does hurt some but I got used to it after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive great gift for yourself &amp; others!&lt;br /&gt;I still use tweezers as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not good quality.</li>
    <li> Waste of time &amp; painful</li>
    <li> This is great for removing facial hairs, thou it hurts on my first few tries.</li>
    <li> Not a strong enough spring to remove hair.</li>
    <li> What can I say but that it works.  Hurts at first, but once you get used to it it is ok.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really get all of my hairs out. I can&#x27;t complain for the price. I use it and it clears up most of my hairs on my face. I like it. It&#x27;s not AMAZING. But it does it&#x27;s job as long as you have patience and a high tolerance for pain. The pain gets better a you keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a student and I work full-time so I don&#x27;t have time/money for routine waxing and I hate depilatories on my face. I can make several passes with this while I sit at the computer reading; for my lip and chin I don&#x27;t need  a mirror. It takes many passes, especially the first time or if you have let the chore slide several days (for me, anyway). And if you have never used anything like this or an electric epilator, yep, it hurts at first. Keeping up with it makes it much more tolerable, although for me the upper lip is still ouchy. This device misses some hairs (maybe if I did use a mirror...) and it takes a little bit of practice to get the twirl right.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the review and was excited to get it.  It finally came in after a few weeks.  Clearly this is made in Asia because the directions are not in English.  They have a few pics on the pac, but honestly, I have no idea how to make this thing work.  Any advice out there?</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone, she said it works really well.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by this product.  It works with little pain &amp; the results are great.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me hurts like hell and makes my skin dry prefer other methods that are less painful and less time consuming.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to figure out the right way to use this contraption. It seems that I am doing it upside down, but that&#x27;s the only way I am finding I can remove hair... but at least it is removing hair at all!</li>
    <li> This thing is just not worth even the small price I paid for it....doesn&#x27;t really work. It gets a hair or two, here and there, but it misses a lot of hair and if that&#x27;s what it is doing, what&#x27;s the point?&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get it.</li>
