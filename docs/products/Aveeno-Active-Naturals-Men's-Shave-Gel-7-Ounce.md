      <li>It&#x27;s almost like shaving with a bar of cheap soap for lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

      <li>The natural based product is superior to some of the cheaper, super foamy brands.  </li>

      <li>Evidently they have made a clean getaway.</li>
      <li>I use this and Nivea Sensitive gel and think this is better for me.  </li>
      <li>Creamier is better for me with sensitive skin</li>

      <li>It is now 7 ounces instead of the old 9 ounces.</li>

<li> (And as far as I&#x27;m concerned, the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s versions are the same product, only the men&#x27;s version is in a black can, has a lighter almond scent and usually costs less.)&lt;br</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I now prefer this combo over other mens products.</li>
<li> I use with the Aveeno Active Naturals Men&#x27;s Face Wash and then the Aveeno Men&#x27;s After Shave Lotion.  </li>
<li> /&gt;We gravitate towards Aveeno because we like to think it has less crap in it, but that&#x27;s probably more or less just marketing.</li>
<li> The biggest plus is it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like other heavily scented shaving products do.</li>
<li> I bought this recently as my previous Aveeno had run out after about a year.</li>
<li> makes it cost quite a bit less than getting both the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; version, or even just one can of either at the store.</li>
<li> I like Aveeno products, but I have to say I have never used a shave gel with this little of a \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; between the razor and my skin.</li>
<li> I have purchased this a few time now.</li>
<li> Does not contain harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> This is not a brand I gravitate to usually</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tended to be sensitive or hate every other shaving gel/cream that I&#x27;ve bought throughout my life.</li>
<li> Still, this does seem to be missing the harsh perfumes found in typical shave gels and the ingredient list is slightly less insane, so we&#x27;ll definitely stick with this for a while.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s proven really hard to get all of those results from one shaving cream or gel.</li>
<li> Too thin to be considered a shave gel.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best fragrance free shave cream /gel I have found.  A little bit goes a long way.  The price is not staggering either.  Razor glides over my face.  Does not contain harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> What can you say about shaving gel, well a lot actually.  Hubby loves the stuff and never gets razor bumps or burns.  He has sensitive skin.  The natural based product is superior to some of the cheaper, super foamy brands.  Has a nice scent that doesn&#x27;t overpower.  Give it a try.  It just might become your new fave shave gel!</li>
    <li> As always, Aveeno gets high marks from me.  I bought it for my fiance, but since he still likes his old tried and true better, I co-opted it for myself.  Great product, smell is unisex so it works for both of us.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Great shaving gel.  I use this and Nivea Sensitive gel and think this is better for me.  Smooth face, no irritation.  I shave 5 times a week and have a very sensitive face and this has been great.</li>
    <li> Too thin to be considered a shave gel. Creamier is better for me with sensitive skin</li>

    <li> this is the best shaving gel that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Great product at reasonable price on Amazon</li>
    <li> Excellent for sensitive and acne prone skin. Perfect!</li>
    <li> my local drugstore never has this in stock, the dark fragrance free kind, they always have the light colored cans. so with prime add on at 3.99 i can stock up.  I did have to wait a couple weeks for it to be backordered, but i knew that before i bought it.</li>
    <li> I recently started buying one can of this shave gel to share between my husband and me, and we both think it&#x27;s great. Together with his sensitive face and my legs, we go through a can a month, and the Amazon subscribe and save option makes it cost quite a bit less than getting both the &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;women&#x27;s&amp;#34; version, or even just one can of either at the store.

Thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream goes on thick and leaves your skin feeling great after shaving.</li>
    <li> Nobody beats Aveeno for shave cream.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin -- this is one of the BEST shaving gels around -- it has a light scent that is not offensive --</li>
    <li> I was using either Neutrogena or Nivea - this is much better than those - smooth, even with an older blade.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son. He asked for Aveeno but didn&#x27;t say which one. When he tried it, he called to say how much he loved it. His face was really soft. He said his girlfriend couldn&#x27;t stop touching his face.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this is the best shaving gel on the market. It makes my face feel smooth and silky, at least that&#x27;s what my wife says.</li>
    <li> Great product at a very reasonable price. Not the foamiest of all creams I&#x27;ve used but has to me a light and delicious oatmeal scent. Came very securely packed.</li>
    <li> I like Aveeno products, but I have to say I have never used a shave gel with this little of a \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; between the razor and my skin. I have had several cuts although I have had the same shaving pattern forever with no problem (with several different brands). It&#x27;s almost like shaving with a bar of cheap soap for lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not use again.</li>
    <li> In 2012 they discontinued Aveeno shave cream for &amp;#34;design flaws&amp;#34; they said. I went and bought as much as I could. A year later Aveeno came back on the shelves 2 OUNCES LIGHTER!!! It is now 7 ounces instead of the old 9 ounces. You cannot find any evidence of this on the internet. Evidently they have made a clean getaway. I now buy Target generic. I will never buy Aveeno again.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this a few time now. Great product with a comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> It eliminated alot of my razor bumps and in grown hairs, It was a great improvement from regular shave gel</li>
    <li> Stopped the razor bumps and reduced ingrowns.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Better than what I used to use.</li>
    <li> Gel type product in a can.  I use it to shave with my wet/dry electric shaver.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I bought this recently as my previous Aveeno had run out after about a year. The previous one was my favorite but I wasn&#x27;t able to find it again. It had a blue cap and an almond scent.  It may have been &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I prefer this is that I get no razor burn or bumps, and it smells acceptable, and I get a close shave. It&#x27;s proven really hard to get all of those results from one shaving cream or gel. It foams enough but not too much, and the container lasts forever. I&#x27;ve tended to be sensitive or hate every other shaving gel/cream that I&#x27;ve bought throughout my life. This is not a brand I gravitate to usually but because it works so well, I will ignore that I don&#x27;t prefer the marketing or label. It&#x27;s the best, and it works the best.</li>
    <li> The ingredients are good. Smells good and works really well. Great for sensitive skin. Reduces razor burn and is soothing to the face.</li>
    <li> The chemicals in this tend to burn my nostrils. I feel pressured to shave quickly to minimize this.</li>
    <li> not as good as described</li>
    <li> this is the best shave gel I have ever found. I have very sensitive skin and this is perfect. I used to buy this at target or Wal-Mart but the ones near me seem to have stopped selling it. I&#x27;m glad I found it on amazon because now I subscribe and save and never run out! Great product and not much of a scent at all</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different because you need to lather it up yourself!  But, it is some of the best shaving cream ever!  Try it</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price of this add on item!</li>
    <li> great price and the gel is awesome. helps me prevent bumps and cuts and leaves the skin feeling moist and healthy.</li>
    <li> not as good as the version for women with the blue cap</li>
    <li> Great shave lotion. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and has a very light natural smell. The biggest plus is it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like other heavily scented shaving products do.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I received before Christmas this is a gift..</li>
    <li> This is easily the best shave gel I&#x27;ve ever used. Gives you a silken SMOOTH shave- Amazing product!</li>
