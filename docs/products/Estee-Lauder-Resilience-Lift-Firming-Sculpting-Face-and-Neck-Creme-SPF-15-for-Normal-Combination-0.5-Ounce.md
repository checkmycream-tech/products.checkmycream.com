<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good cream.  Seems to erase fine lines istantly.</li>
    <li> I have used resilience lift for years.  It goes on smoothly, has SPF 15, and at almost 69 I have hardly a wrinkle!  I will never be without it.</li>
    <li> This feels wonderful on my face.  A little dab of it goes a long way.  I am sensitive to lotions and perfumes.  This lotion is a little too perfumy for me but I like how it feels so I will buy it again.  The scent does not bother me.</li>
    <li> great cream, small container but I will get 2 next time or 3, great results</li>
    <li> like it but a bit greasy that leaves a shine, but seems to nourish skin. lifting ability - maybe over time</li>
    <li> I love this product and believe it would be good for any skin type.  Love the way my skin feels after using it...like silk.  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a product that works!!!</li>
    <li> Huge fan of this product.&lt;br /&gt;Use this before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great and makes great improvement&lt;br /&gt;on how my skin looks and feels!</li>
    <li> Terrible! It&#x27;s too scented, heavy, oily and doesn&#x27;t absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on my neck, I actually get rolled up dirt and residue from the product. There&#x27;s so much, I have to brush it off of my shirt. I tried it on my face just to see and it broke me out. I only use it on my hands so I can&#x27;t speak for the firming part of the creme, but I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Was very oily. Made zits come out when I usually do not have them</li>
    <li> Flakes on your face, not a fan.</li>
    <li> A nice product, but a tad greasy for summer use. Will try it in the dry winter months.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Love this for smoothing and gentle firming and skin cover. Light, wonderful smell  no cheap, tho.</li>
    <li> Perfect but small size</li>
    <li> I had problems with this product, it did cause my face to breakout. I am not sure if it was the SPF factor or not. I will try the product again but not from a opened gift set.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. My skin around my eyes and upper lips have improved. Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product got 15 years and I love it and would not use any other brand</li>
    <li> Excelente cream for lift and firming</li>
    <li> Love this , love how it feel on my face</li>
    <li> Very good product small for price</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t good for my  face... made me itchy so I returned it. May be good for others.</li>
    <li> Made my shin too oily and clogged my pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years and absolutely adore this product!</li>
    <li> The product was as expected and delivered when promised.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first to try this but it is working on the wrinkles/crepe on my neck and jaw/face,  Thank you: Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Smooth and refreshing....</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best face creams ever.  I can not live without this creme.  I have dry skin and live in a cold climate and this is the best there is!</li>
    <li> Really a great product and a good deal to allow me to try product. Shipping was very good</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder Resillience Lift/Sculpting Face and Neck Crème SPF 15, has got to be a  real good product because on the name, thank you amazon!</li>
    <li> I am SO glad I could find this small size firming creme.  I usually would purchase the larger one but our budget has been cut in more than half.  Yikes, didn&#x27;t think I could continue my skin care regime, but at this smaller price I can afford to buy it every time it runs out.  Great peace of mind because of this and I hope I can continually buy this.  The product was excellent.</li>
    <li> This product is okay, but I have extra dry skin and was hoping for more moisture than it gave me.  I just re-apply during the day, but, that, of course, uses more of the product so it will not last as long.</li>
    <li> Nice moisturizer.  Doesn&#x27;t firm.</li>
    <li> Loved the Creme. Very good value.</li>
    <li> Ni ce cream, good price</li>
    <li> everything i expected ,the price was right</li>
    <li> This product cause a rash on my eye lid! I had to go to a doctor!&lt;br /&gt;but the seller was under standing and gave me a refund. i hold&lt;br /&gt;nothing against them. Estee lauder though, i cant believe this happen.</li>
    <li> feel it works very well</li>
    <li> I am in my early 20s however, I use this stuff religiously under my eyes because I have dark circles. I can tell a major differece since I began using this. I do not need concelear anymore! I put it on twice a day. I dab a little under my eyes after washing my face at night and I dab a little on in the morning before applying my makeup. It does not irritate my eyes and the smell is really non existant. There is a light smell but nothing harsh. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using different products of EL for 25 years. This is my current day cream.  I am 60 and, as a blonde, I did do probably a bit too much sun bathing in my time.  However, after all the different face creams I tried, this is the company that served my skin the best.  Visible difference was the one I used to use, and now I use this.  There are several other in the ultra expensive category I haven&#x27;t tried, but I am very happy with this product.  Cream doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;firm&amp;#34; your skin.  Some of the reviews here are ludicrous.  What a moisturizer should do is not add to larger pores, keep your skin moisturized and flexible and reduce the advance of wrinkles, as they inevitably take their place on an older woman&#x27;s face. Find a cream that works, and this one works for me very well, but remember to drink at least&lt;br /&gt;8 glasses of water a day.  Water is the skin&#x27;s best friend.</li>
    <li> Great price......great product. Cant afford $85.00 for large bottle so this works&lt;br /&gt;perfectly for me. Its in my budget.&lt;br /&gt;Good valu</li>
    <li> I have used Estee Lauder in the past, but moved on to another well known product.&lt;br /&gt;The described product listed above is truly a remarkable product. After applying this crème, my&lt;br /&gt;foundations goes on like sink evenly covering my face. I have great skin for my age 64, because&lt;br /&gt;of resilience lift. Won&#x27;t you please use it and buy it from Amazon please.</li>
    <li> The price was incredible!  I purchased this product in regular retail before and the price I got it for this time was fantastic!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Should be a larger jar of this somewhere!  It lifts and firms as described.  Will purchase more asap. It&#x27;s a older women&#x27;s fancy.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using another brand.  Loved it!  Will definitely use again.</li>
    <li> I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED ESTEE LAUDER PRODUCTS, AND FOR THE PRICE IT WORKS.  SCENT IS REALLY NICE TOO, AND SMOOTHY PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> This is second time I order this product here. I used use this brand of product and find there is no difference between original and this one. As long as it fresh like this ( still have 18 month to expire date), I would use it.</li>
    <li> Have not used this product.  Can&#x27;t say weather I liked it or not.  I just ordered something that goes with this product.</li>
    <li> It smells really nice, and hopefully it can also work fine! The price is durable compared to the real store in market. I love it!!!!!Recommend!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this creme, I use it almost daily as and love the added firmness it gives as well as the fact it is SPF 15!</li>
    <li> Lower price than department store, great product.  I bought three.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is true, but it&#x27;s a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for many years. The texture, how it feels on my face, and the smell are delightful.  It&#x27;s not shiny. I put it on soon after I shower and put makeup on half an hour or so later. I want it to soak in. It&#x27;s so moist that I don&#x27;t have to point any more on when I apply the makeup.  My mother used it and I thought it was for old women. I started wearing it when I was a young woman, and now I&#x27;m of a certain age.</li>
    <li> the production is nice. I hope my mom will like it. Besides, I do not know why on the bottom of it  there is a blue mark try to cover some information.</li>
    <li> Felt good on my skin. It make my face feel soft.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot specially for the winter. Smells nice and does a good job.  Not sure if I look 10 years younger, but I would like to :)</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time and in good condition.  Really like this product and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Very good product, worth the price. And the shipment is really fast and safely packaged; I placed the order two days before, this afternoon I got the shipment.Thanks.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and love it  I highly recommend it.  It is a must have in my cosmetic line.  Estee Lauder is always worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> It is like so-so - You use it , it is pleasant to use, but not much result, just the name. I am not sure I would buy it again</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and use nothing else!And I have been thinking about using it as my night cream ,also.</li>
    <li> Excellent, thank you.</li>
    <li> new like the seller no open crema soft is ok and the price also.</li>
    <li> Amazing product for your skin!  Love it.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Estée Lauder It leaves your skin and neck feeling super soft</li>
    <li> Great product, but it was shown as 2 and I received one. The price was still ok for one, but Amazon needs to check quality control.</li>
    <li> I liked&lt;br /&gt;Excelent product</li>
    <li> I have used Estee Lauded for years and don&#x27;t use any other facial cosmetics.  I ordered this while shopping on line, and because of major surgery I was unable to get out.  I only needed this creme and was really checking out price.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with how this makes my face look and feel. Use it twice a day. I had hoped the jar would be larger, but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good Price and quality at its best</li>
    <li> my only favorite cream to use.  it really made a difference in my skin. loved it.</li>
    <li> I can switch back and forth from the time zone to the resilience lift and I am glad they both have the spf in the product instead of having to put it on seperately.I like this cream too and I was thinking of trying the night and eye creams, but for now I am liking the time zone.  I will do the switch in the winter months.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product and i will continue to use. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mother, she received a free sample from a Department Store and loved it! Well when she ran out of the product she was going to go back to buy from the department store. I asked her to wait, since it was so expensive....Thank you Amazon you had it available at a cheaper price, so I bought three and made my mom really happy!</li>
    <li> Too small for this available price.</li>
    <li> I tried this for my neck, hoping it would firm it a little, nothing happened.  It is a nice moisturizer but that is not why I bought it.  Thank goodness I started with a sample&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it will work for some, did not work for me</li>
    <li> This product is a good moisturizer thats why it gets the \\&quot;Its ok\\&quot; rating but I have seen no change in my skin since using this product. May work for some but not me. It also nice to get a small size like this to try before you buy full size.</li>
    <li> This product is great, BUT, watch out when buying from KL Design &amp; Import., I believe this specific vendor is not telling you all the truth, because they are selling the travel size (which is actually a gift from Estee Lauder when buying its products). And yes they are selling it in only US$0.49 but adding US$10 in shipping, a huge deception.</li>
    <li> They sold the product that there was &amp;#34;no sale&amp;#34;on the back of the product.very small .It is suppose to free gift.cheating,I really hate this kind of behavor</li>
    <li> This is a great face, throat, neck &amp; chin cream. For best results, start using it between ages 40 &amp; 50.</li>
    <li> It is a sample with the statement &amp;#34;not for individual resale&amp;#34; on it as described by another reviewer, but I was expecting that and was willing to pay the price I paid for it. I like the product very much- it has a nice texture and smell and I like the SPF protection. I&#x27;m a 56 year old woman with slightly dry skin.</li>
    <li> I did not use it, but my wife loves it! :)&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? Great product, very good price! :)</li>
    <li> Used the entire jar and will buy more.  Smells wonderful, feels great, helps fine lines and has sunscreen.  However, very expensive.</li>
    <li> I have been using for almost 2 weeks. LOVE!! I noticed a difference right away &amp; better than that, my co-workers noticed as well!! Please keep in stock  &amp;#34; )</li>
    <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
    <li> my wife is very happy</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t find the smell at all unpleasant and am very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is not for individual sale. It is a free gift when you buy ESTEE LAUDER. So, I return the item.</li>
    <li> Can see the difference in my face.  But, no lifting results in the neck area.  Would use the product again.</li>
    <li> I really liked this creme, but couldn&#x27;t get past the fragrance, so I was unable to purchase it again! The scent was overwhelming and smelled very elderly to me!  Anyone else have an issue with the scent????</li>
    <li> Very nice product, totally non-irritating, very smoothing to the skin, and some firming. Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer.  It feels so light on, but it makes my skin feel so soft.  I don&#x27;t need a lot of lift, but I can really tell a difference when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I like it so I keep buying it. I buy it on amazon because it is less expensive than buying it at Macys or Norstromes.</li>
    <li> this was not sealed and the cream inside stunk!</li>
    <li> Feels like silk when applying, leaves face smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream many times and it is excellent. I received the package on time and am very happy with the results that I&#x27;ve seen. i will order a larger one next time.&lt;br /&gt;Berta NY</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super flawless</li>
    <li> You can not go wrong with Estee Lauder. No matter where you might start looking and trying..you will be back. Give it a try with the sample. You will be amazed! And, thanks to the seller, Mayflower. So easy to buy from and a very trusted seller! Ms. Audrey K.</li>
    <li> I liked the product, but this was a very small size and advertised for under a dollar, but I had to pay $10.00 in shipping charges.  I wasn&#x27;t thinking very clearly on this one.</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Will keep merchant on file to order more when needed.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!! I could tell a difference in my skin by the next day. Really takes care of the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> lovely face cream, I recommend! Leather grateful, SPECIAL I needed him in the winter . Estee Lauder is one of the top cosmetic companies</li>
    <li> I choose 5 stars because this is a good product for facial moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants softer skin should use this.</li>
    <li> Might be wishful thinking, but my wrinkles do not seem to be as pronounced as before I started to use this creme.  Also, It feels good and helps me look betyer.</li>
    <li> A great product results from first used. Great consistency.. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Was looking for something to help with those little lines in the upper lip. This comes close...along with the serum from Estee Lauder too. Very good product. I also use the green cream for those areas that don&#x27;t need to be tightened but do need to be moistened. This cream doesn&#x27;t seem to be for moisturizing...mainly for firming.</li>
    <li> Product a good one but way too small for the money. Not enough to evaluate!</li>
    <li> Works great under makeup or just use as night cream.  Need it for under the eyes!  Really works!</li>
    <li> happy with the product and the service</li>
    <li> This feels so glamorous and smooth on my skin.  I use it at night and in the morning. My only problem is I have to buy two because they dont make a bigger one. If they do, I haven&#x27;t found it. It has the spf so I can wear it alone if I&#x27;m just going to mow the lawn. It doesn&#x27;t break my face out.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> When I purchased I thought this was the same as what I normally purchase at department store.  The cream comes in both normal and dry skin.  This is for normal and what I normally wear is for dry.</li>
    <li> RECOMMENDED EXCELLENT PRODUCT QUALITY 100%</li>
    <li> Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%.</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting a larger amount. Anyone getting the product needs to pay close attention. This was the size that you can sometimes get as a free sample at some stores.</li>
    <li> OMG! This cream does work, really sculpt your face and  looks GREAT and FIRM, I have tried MANY ,but this really WORKS!</li>
    <li> Love this!  Feels rich, doesn&#x27;t go on greasy or heavy; I use both day and evening, and am looking forward to great results!</li>
