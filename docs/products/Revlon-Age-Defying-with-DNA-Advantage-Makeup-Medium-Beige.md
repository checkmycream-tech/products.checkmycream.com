<li> I like this new bottle because it doesn&#x27;t get so messy.</li>
<li> This foundation goes on so well, I use a facial sponge to apply it, you need very little foundation for complete coverage.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not normally sensitive to smells</li>
<li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
<li> But, not as long as I would like.</li>
<li> and it last a little longer on me.</li>
<li> My skin is very dry and it hydrates it and doesn&#x27;t show little flakes of dry skin on my face.</li>
<li> review that talks about this Revlon product smelling bad surprised me.  </li>
<li> I been using this foundation lately to finish it.</li>
<li> It stays moist on your face, covers blemishes and discolorations without feeling or looking thick or chalky.  </li>
<li> Definitely not good for oily skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for about a year now, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance (and bad smells!)</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this product smelling bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> The reason I gave it just three stars though is because it smells AWFUL!</li>

    <li> this is nice and creamy and blends in to the skin nicely but be careful not to use to much  .</li>
    <li> Been using this foundation 2 years. Flawless finish, last all day, feels like silk going on, great coverage.only product I will use.</li>
    <li> wont say its the best foundation I&#x27;ve ever used, but we&#x27;ll see how it goes, think I like my Loreal Infallible better.</li>
    <li> recieved on time..great product</li>
    <li> The makeup goes on smooth, but it smells very old.</li>
    <li> This is great makeup and covers great. My skin is very dry and it hydrates it and doesn&#x27;t show little flakes of dry skin on my face. The reason I gave it just three stars though is because it smells AWFUL! I couldn&#x27;t even stand to have it on my face because that&#x27;s all I could smell. I&#x27;m not normally sensitive to smells but this was overpowering.</li>
    <li> I discovered this makeup about 3 years ago upon the recommendation of a friend.  It does exactly what is says.  It stays moist on your face, covers blemishes and discolorations without feeling or looking thick or chalky.  It helps fill in wrinkles.  After it sets, it will not rub off on clothes.  I love the new pump bottle.  No mess around the lid to contend with.  A great foundation.</li>
    <li> This foundation must be mixed before applying. Smack the jar lightly in your hand a couple of times before applying, otherwise you&#x27;ll get a shinny glassy look on your face. I love the color. The color is more indicative of the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I am in my upper 40&#x27;s and have taken good care of my skin.  I do, however, have some fine lines and need a nice, silky smooth foundation and this Revlon is it!  It provides flawless coverage without looking at all \\&quot;pancakey\\&quot;.  This spring I&#x27;ve been blending this Revlon Age Defying Foundation with the Almay #200 Smart Shade Anti Aging makeup and I love the look!  I get the sunscreen protection from Almay, and the velvety smooth appearance from the Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Signa F88 angled kabuki brush for application.  It&#x27;s the absolute best foundation application brush I&#x27;ve found!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review that talks about this Revlon product smelling bad surprised me.  I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for about a year now, and I&#x27;m very sensitive to fragrance (and bad smells!) and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this product smelling bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if it was a really old bottle they had on the shelves...  because the ones I buy have virtually no fragrance at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, highly recommend!  I use the Spice Beige - I have fair skin, auburn hair.  Works perfect!</li>
    <li> The foundation goes on easily and provides good all day coverage.  I would recommend it as a well-priced effective product.</li>
    <li> I been using this foundation lately to finish it. I brought it last year in the summer and i had to stop using it. Blends well but the coverage doesn&#x27;t last long. I been using it now since it&#x27;s not so humid and it last a little longer on me. But, not as long as I would like. Definitely not good for oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that I have used for a long time.  The pump dispenser uses up all the makeup very easily.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time.  Revlon is constantly improving it.  A good foundation for older skin -- it covers well but does not cake.  Whether DNA Advantage is effective or not,  I do not know; I just like this product!</li>
    <li> This foundation goes on so well, I use a facial sponge to apply it, you need very little foundation for complete coverage.  It covers well.</li>
    <li> I like this new bottle because it doesn&#x27;t get so messy. Of course, I might not be able to get so much out of it. That remains to be seen.</li>
