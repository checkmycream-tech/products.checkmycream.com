      <li>Keri Shea Butter is very rich and emollient.</li>

      <li>I wish they had a travel size available.</li>
      <li>For an incredibly low cost this amazing cream has become my favorite face cream ever.</li>
      <li>Always others, that worked, but did not have the clean smell that this does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is a great lotion for ultra dry skin.</li>
      <li>were saying it works great because I have dry skin</li>
      <li>I am lucky I didn&#x27;t have anything planned today</li>
      <li>Good for dry itchy skin.  </li>
      <li>The product is good, I use to have dry and scaly spots on my face but a week of using this lotion it all went away.</li>
      <li>The best moisturizing lotion when you have dry skin especially during winter.  </li>

      <li>I am currently waiting for the top coat to dry that I put on my nails after vigorously scrubbing them to attempt to salvage my paint job.</li>
      <li>The scent is subtle but pleasant; the feel is comfortingly lubricating without being overly slick or greasy; it absorbs quickly yet provides lingering comfort and protection against dryness.</li>
      <li>I HAD a two day old gel mani-pedi and it ruined it.</li>
      <li>With cost in mind, I recently bought a bottle of St. Ives shea butter and oatmeal lotion, to see how it compares; it&#x27;s okay--a little too strongly scented for my taste--but</li>
      <li>a seventy five year old woman I am constantly given compliments on my youthful skin and told I look</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s dry as fast as you put it on your body and leave your skin dry.</li>

<li> For one thing, it&#x27;s cheaper; for another, the shea butter itself is the main ingredient (after water) in the Jergens, whereas in the other shea butter formulations I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s way down on the list</li>

<li> Buy Keri lotion with Shea Butter and you will I promise you will not be sorry.</li>

<li> I just wish it weren&#x27;t quite so expensive!</li>

<li> It&#x27;s greasy, stinks, and(the worst part)</li>
<li> This stuff is awful.</li>
<li> Oh, and my room still smells like this terrible lotion!</li>

    <li> This lotion is incredibly rich and creamy, soaks in well; makes a noticeable difference on my skin (especially feet and legs!).</li>
    <li> This is the best moisturizing lotion I had ever used. I could&#x27;nt find this product in the stores,so, I went to Amazonandordered 2 bottles, so I would have for the coming winter months. This product is good in summer and winter months.</li>
    <li> I have never used this lotion. Always others, that worked, but did not have the clean smell that this does.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will always use it.</li>
    <li> The product is good, I use to have dry and scaly spots on my face but a week of using this lotion it all went away. I love it!</li>
    <li> Good price. Shipped fast. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Of all the lotions I&#x27;ve tried, the Keri with shea butter was my favorite (until recently--see below). The scent is subtle but pleasant; the feel is comfortingly lubricating without being overly slick or greasy; it absorbs quickly yet provides lingering comfort and protection against dryness. I use it in lieu of aftershave, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be at all comedogenic, either. I just wish it weren&#x27;t quite so expensive! With cost in mind, I recently bought a bottle of St. Ives shea butter and oatmeal lotion, to see how it compares; it&#x27;s okay--a little too strongly scented for my taste--but the Keri is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: recently I stumbled upoon Jergens shea butter lotion, which I think outpoints the Keri. For one thing, it&#x27;s cheaper; for another, the shea butter itself is the main ingredient (after water) in the Jergens, whereas in the other shea butter formulations I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s way down on the list (I&#x27;m not sure about the Keri, as I don&#x27;t have a bottle in hand to check).</li>
    <li> The best moisturizing lotion when you have dry skin especially during winter.  Not too greasy and makes your skin look shiny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  The consistency of the lotion has always been the same.  But this time the lotion poured much thinner than before.  I wonder if this represents a change in the product formulation--which would be a shame--or if I just got a bad batch.  In the past, with the product as it WAS, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Advertises a picture of two bottles. Charged a price that would be fair for two bottles. I only received one bottle of lotion. I really feel like I was ripped off by this seller. Would never advise anyone to buy from them. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I love this especially for use in cold weather. It moisturizes well. I wish they had a travel size available.</li>
    <li> For many year I bought expensive face creams, that is until I discovered the magic of Keri lotion with Shea Butter. For an incredibly low cost this amazing cream has become my favorite face cream ever. .As a seventy five year old woman I am constantly given compliments on my youthful skin and told I look ten years younger then I am. Buy Keri lotion with Shea Butter and you will I promise you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I hope Keri never discontinues this moisturizing therapy. I have the hardest time finding the best body lotion, but this one does the trick! The moisture stays all day too!</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday at the store and hoped it would do well. Using lotion has been part of my routine for the past few years so I know when it&#x27;s good or bad(I put it on my arms, legs, hands, and feet). This stuff is awful. It&#x27;s greasy, stinks, and(the worst part) took off my GEL nail polish. I HAD a two day old gel mani-pedi and it ruined it. I have been using gel for a while and have never had this happen before(except with spray on sunscreen). I am currently waiting for the top coat to dry that I put on my nails after vigorously scrubbing them to attempt to salvage my paint job. I am lucky I didn&#x27;t have anything planned today so I could stay home and attempt to fix this mess(my nails have to last me another week or so). Oh, and my room still smells like this terrible lotion! It smells chemically and gross! NEVER buy this brand!!! Or at least this specific lotion! I know I am not giving this brand a second chance ever!!</li>
    <li> This creams my skin great it not greasy like others were saying it works great because I have dry skin</li>
    <li> i love what this lotion does to my skin. i had to order because they were out at the wal-mart.</li>
    <li> My boss uses this and I thought she was wearing an expensive perfume. It is the best I&#x27;ve found yet for very dry hands</li>
    <li> It is so Silky.  And lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> Really like this product, I personally felted good when using this moisturizer. Good to apply after every shower or whenever you wash your hands or parts of the body.  Goodness is the feel of the lotion on the body. Try it you might like it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this lotion, even a small amount to just barely moisturize your hands leaves them feeling greasy. I also don&#x27;t care for the scent. I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Keri Shea Butter is very rich and emollient. It is a great lotion for ultra dry skin. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with that said let me review the seller. Their advertisement of this product is deceptive. They show a picture of two items for a listed price leading you to believe you will receive two for that price. However, you only receive one bottle.  Two items for the price listed would have been an excellent bargain, which is why I placed the order. But the listed price for one bottle is two times the actual cost!!!  For that reason this review only gets 1 star. No one wants to be cheated and this seller is has done just that.</li>
    <li> Recommended by dermetologist.  Good for dry itchy skin.  Nice fragrancy. Would recommend.  Wish it could be purchased from local drug store but not available.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I&#x27;ve found to relieve the feeling of dryness on my aging hands, arms and feet.</li>
    <li> My neighbor got me started using Keri on my face years ago.  I still do and at 68, I get a lot of comments on how good my skin looks on my face.</li>
    <li> Great every day skin care.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s does nothing for your skin and it&#x27;s dry as fast as you put it on your body and leave your skin dry.</li>
