      <li>Great product - I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update after I use a bit more.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m completely satisfied.</li>
      <li>My hair looks so much better that I often don&#x27;t wash it out.  </li>
      <li>I have kinky hair and it makes my hair more manageable before a wash.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so lovely...</li>
      <li>I have used this about 3 to 4 times and my hair now looks healthy and shiny,</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and so I took a chance and I am glad I did</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products.  </li>
      <li>Love this.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
      <li>It smells great and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
      <li>I saw this in Sephora and wanted it right then, but took out my handy phone and my Amazon app and saw that I could get it for a much better price....</li>
      <li>I have used other Alterna Caviar products and been impressed by the quality and results, not so with the Overnight Rescue.  </li>
      <li>And the hair absorbs it very quickly.  </li>
      <li>some people don&#x27;t like strong scents).  </li>
      <li>The Alterna Anti-Aging Blowout Creme is also incredible for making my blowout style silky smooth, it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; as long as when I use the Living Proof product.</li>
      <li>If they come out with a scent free version, I would buy this by the truck load.  </li>
      <li>recommended, make hair shinning and smooth</li>
      <li>Found the same product on amazon at a lower price so purchased it happily.</li>
      <li>When I first got this, I thought it was pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I was eager to try this product after reading so many favorable reviews about how it had made people&#x27;s hair so much softer, more manageable, shiny, etc.  </li>
      <li>This product has a heavenly, clean and light fragrance.  </li>
      <li>but so worth it to me!</li>
      <li>and right away and ta da!</li>
      <li>My hair felt great when it was wet</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve ever even  used a deep conditioner this good.  </li>
      <li>and it really does make you hair better, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker</li>
      <li>Totally changed the texture of my hair, just not in a good way.</li>
      <li>In the morning when you wash your hair just add water and massage first, it acts like a very mild shampoo.</li>
      <li>kept it feeling moderately good although it was flat every morning.  </li>
      <li>If you blowdry your hair straight (like I do), I also suggest Living Proof Style Extender - my hair still looks great the next day when I wake up.</li>
      <li>I love most all of the Alterna products, especially this one.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is awesome, I have become a hair care  junkie over the last two years ( when my ex hair dresser destroyed my hair ) and this is one I&#x27;ll be keeping in my arsenal of ... Products that actually work!  </li>
      <li>Quick delivery, as well.</li>
      <li>Great for my hair, does have a slight off smell</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this the from sephora and loved it. Found the same product on amazon at a lower price so purchased it happily. But this one from amazon smells different than the one I had from sephora. Container looks the same but the smell and the result on my hair are different. I will not purchase this product from amazon again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this to make a difference but it just doesn&#x27;t.  I have thick, wavy hair that I color and highlight.  The only positive is that is helps calm frizz if I apply it when I wake up.  But the whole &amp;#34;overnight hair miracle&amp;#34; thing was bogus.</li>
    <li> After one use my dry, damaged, over-highlighted (bad hairdresser!!!), colored, poor abused 37-year-old hair... was soft and silky and not frizzy at all!  It wasn&#x27;t straight, but after much abuse my previously curly hair that had not been curling properly any more... well I woke up and it was like big fat magazine curls.  Not frizzy tiny ones.  And that was after sleeping on it all night.  I almost didn&#x27;t want to wash it out.  I did and it was only ok afterwards but I am going to keep using it - I have high hopes.  I think you could almost not wash it out if you have curly hair and just go as is.  Hm... It also didn&#x27;t look greasy at all.  And it smells great!  I had tried the Redken anti-ageing stuff - and I have to say in comparison, that product made my hair feel \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and coated and I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all.  Very chemical-ly.  Alterna&#x27;s product just smells good and your hair feels nice after.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It dried my hair so much !! And totally made my hair look unhealthy</li>
    <li> This lotion softens my hair, defines big, bouncy curls overnight. I must admit I have a hard time deciding to wash it out the next morning, because my hair is sooooo beautiful!!! I have left it in for an entire day. It is absolutely the best thing I have ever used in my hair, I am absolutely addicted!! Thank you Alterna!</li>
    <li> But still great. My ends have been horribly dry and breaking. And I&#x27;ve really wanted to avoid a hair cutt because they always seem to take way to much off and I end up in tears. Anyways! I&#x27;ve been using this along with the shampoo and conditioner and there is a noticeable difference. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3weeks now and my thin brittle hair is honestly looking alot healthier. It&#x27;s a great deal on amazon and I&#x27;ll Continue to buying this. Again it&#x27;s not a product you&#x27;ll put on and right away and ta da! But keep using it for best results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Have used for a long time.</li>
    <li> Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you.  This is exactly what I ordered and it came on time and wrapped perfectly. I hightly recommend this product to someone who does their hair at home and they are looking for an extra ummpf to add to their routine.</li>
    <li> We are always searching for that miracle product that will turn our frazzled locks into shiny, bouncy hair. Ladies, keep looking. Don&#x27;t buy into the hype. This is an overpriced, so-so product.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting! Great product - I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great, no bad smell, no residue on your pillow. I also use this when my natural curls get frizzy.</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell if this is helping my hair or not.  At least it smells nice.</li>
    <li> Love this.  Conditions at night with no oil. Goes a long way.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see difference in my hair ,&lt;br /&gt;and I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome, I have become a hair care  junkie over the last two years ( when my ex hair dresser destroyed my hair ) and this is one I&#x27;ll be keeping in my arsenal of ... Products that actually work!  I&#x27;m with the reviewer that said they couldn&#x27;t decide to wash it the next day...because it looked sooo good just waking up after using it. Ps my hair is thin and about bra strap length and Im 48 yrs old....and I color to hide the gray....but with this and the other goodies in my routine...and a new, excellent hairdresser...my hair is pretty again.</li>
    <li> This works really nicely on my fine, straight, highlighted hair. After washing it out the next day, my hair was soft and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy and I love the smell.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product. When I use it, she says that I have much less split ends. I have never noticed the product coming off on my pillowcase, and by the time I wake up in the morning my hair is dry and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> After the first use I notice the difference on my hair. My hair is really fine and frizzy, I usually wear it natural, but with this product when I use the blow dryer it looks absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> Amazing product!!! My hair looked and felt so great. Shining , conditioned and healthy.Miracle in a bottle overnight. I love this product.</li>
    <li> I have rather thick, curly, color-treated hair that has become very dry and damaged from an attempt to lighten it. I have used the ALterna Caviar conditioner in the past and I loved it, so I thought I would give this a try. I used it as instructed until the bottle ran out and I saw no results. I tried using more, I tried using less. I saw no changes. After leaving it in overnight my  hair felt stiff. After washing the product out I saw no difference in the health of my hair, even after repeated uses. The one good thing about it was the smell. Alterna products always smell lovely.</li>
    <li> i put 4 pumps on each of 6 sections of my hair on maybe the bottom 3 inches of my hair.  Smells nice, not too strong.  Absorbs completely within minutes.  Doesn&#x27;t get on your pillow &amp; you can comb through it in the morning and go through the day without washing it out (unlike the Redkin overnight one which leaves a thick creamy residue you can&#x27;t comb through, doesn&#x27;t absorb, and you have to wash it out in the morning).  The only thing that compares is the Pantene overnight one but that smells stronger (good but some people don&#x27;t like strong scents).  Also the Pantene one doesn&#x27;t absorb 100% like this one and you can&#x27;t comb through it as well, but its cheaper.  I use the Alterna one night, Pantene the next to save a little.  Doing so keeps the ends of my waist length hair moisturized, and lets me have more time between trims so I can grow my hair longer.  Also keeps the split ends to a minimum (still get them but not as much).  I LOVE this stuff and will always have some</li>
    <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used. I have thick, long hair and I can see quite a difference when I use this. I use this when my hair is almost dry. Then I rub it in all the way to the ends. It takes a lot, but again, I have thick long hair. Then I comb through and I leave it in overnight as directed. You don&#x27;t need to rinse, it just melds into your hair overnight. The product works really well and keeps my long hair (to my waist) very healthy and strong. I use twice a month or so, not every time I shampoo.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this product works.  I have kinky hair and it makes my hair more manageable before a wash.  My one pet peeve is the smell.  I suddenly hate scents in products and it makes it hard to sleep with the scent in the product.  If they come out with a scent free version, I would buy this by the truck load.  I use it on the day I need to wash by hair for a few hours before the actual wash.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products.  It was packaged nicely and arrived as expected on time.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff...and anything else Alterna makes, for that matter !!!  My hair is so lovely...so soft...and their whole line is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair fuller and healthier, even my hairdresser noticed.My color treated and fine hair felt silky and shiny, and even stronger and longer due to this product.Miracle product! I have purchased this product from &amp;#34;Hair Care Outlet&amp;#34; and never had a problem.</li>
    <li> Only used this product a couple of times, but seems to work very well on damaged hair.  It is not greasy in anyway and doesn&#x27;t get all over your pillow cases and sheets..</li>
    <li> This is a must have product for anyone that colors their hair. I put it on before going to bed, then shower it out the next morning. It has a luxe feeling without leaving a residue on my pillowcase. My hair feels refreshed and ready for the day.</li>
    <li> I saw this in Sephora and wanted it right then, but took out my handy phone and my Amazon app and saw that I could get it for a much better price.... yay!!!  This stuff is good and helps my dry dry curly hair look somewhat human!</li>
    <li> I swim in a pool every day and this keeps my hair soft.</li>
    <li> This product has helped tame my dry frizzy hair.  I put ia small amount on before I go to bed and wake up with smoother silkier hair.  My hair looks so much better that I often don&#x27;t wash it out.  This is a new staple in my hair care regime.  I would strongly recommend it  to anyone especially those living in warm, dry climates.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! I totally see a difference love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Just love the Alterna Caviar Overnight Rescue-3.4 oz.. Works great and I am ordering more after I finish writing this review. Great for over processed hair.</li>
    <li> It smells great and leaves my hair very soft. You are supposed to wash it out in the morning but sometimes I just leave it in.</li>
    <li> I am not a fake reviewer! I have been using this product for a year! I love it. Due to health issues and numerous medications my highlighted hair was in bad shape! This product has reconditioned my hair. The shine and manageability has returned. I have very straight hair. My daughter that has naturally wavy hair loves this product as well. I always know she has used it. Her hair shines and her curls are beautiful! I know the price is high but so worth it to me!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the very positive reviews. I have thick, course, naturally wavy hair that is also highlighted. I used it in conjunction with the Alterna Caviar Replenishing Shampoo and Conditioner. I put the product on as instructed, left it on overnight and woke up in the morning, washed it out and then used the shampoo and conditioner. In the shower, my hair felt great. When I got out, and blow dried my hair normally, the ends were very tangled and &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;  for a lack of a better way to describe it. As I applied the heat of the dryer, it got worse. The ends of my hair were dry and unmanageable. I thought that maybe I didn&#x27;t get it properly rinsed out. So I went back to the bathroom and washed it again. It was better after that so I chalked it up to not properly rinsing. Well, when I used it again, it was even worse and no amount of rinsing would get the stickiness out of my hair. I had to go to my local salon and purchase a clarifying shampoo to get it out. It could just be my hair, but that was my experience. After this purchase, i bought Redken Diamond Oil Shampoo and Conditioner and the Shatterproof Oil Intense and my hair is like spun silk!</li>
    <li> I really like this! ❤</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchase after all the great reviews, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all products are wonderful for everybody.</li>
    <li> Lotion-like texture, white, not rich or greasy. Comparing this to Pantene overnight repair... Sorry to say, Pantene wins. With Caviar I experienced no change in hair whatsoever. No results. Nothing negative, nothing positive - nothing at all to suggest that this product does anything at all! So, before committing to this smallish yet pricey bottle, go get a sample at the mall or get Pantene @$6 double the size a and some moderate results. Amazing that so many people felt so passionate about this mediocre product to write a 5 star review and dissapear off the face of the earth... Fake reviews alert!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing in helping combat frizz! It helps nourish the hair and has a fresh scent that&#x27;s not over poweeing at all. I use it all the time and the price is grear on Amazon versus regular retail.</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel like silk! Great overnight conditioner.</li>
    <li> One of the best overnight treatments out there. In the morning when you wash your hair just add water and massage first, it acts like a very mild shampoo. It gives out a little lather. Wash it off first and then do your usual routine you will see the fifference.</li>
    <li> One of the best serums I&#x27;ve used. It can be very heavy if you put it on your roots and on healthy hair but I definitely notice a change in my hair overall and definitely on the dry areas.</li>
    <li> I started with one product and now have ordered the entire line. Excellent line of products! Caviar is a great name, it really is a luxury product for hair. I had chemical damage and after using these products I get tons of compliments on my hair. It has shine, body, and looks like healthy hair again. The products are worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it recommended but it felt just like any conditioner. I didn&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> Hi! Love the brand best treatment for my hair nourished and shinny.</li>
    <li> For 4 years I have been using all sorts of products on my hair to make it look beautiful, feel wonderful, &amp; manageable.. I decided to buy this plus other Alterna items &amp; have seen mysterious results almost instantly... I am now recommending to everyone I know, &amp; asked local salons to bring the products into their shops..</li>
    <li> With all the news saying be careful with reviews since some companies pay for fake reviews I still ordered this product because it promised a lot and the reviews were great but sadly it didn&#x27;t deliver. I did not notice any difference and it has a faint fish smell. I am now giving a try to the rapid repair spray from the same line to see if it works better than this one.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I thought it was pretty good.  I had short virgin hair and Rescue kept it feeling moderately good although it was flat every morning.  Sometimes I used it on wet hair, like a leave-in serum, and it was all right, helped with the combing, but didn&#x27;t make a difference after the hair was dry.  However, my hair is much longer now, longer than shoulder-length.  I used it last week and ugh, I got flat, skanky hair.  Well, I put it up that day, so it wasn&#x27;t a problem.  Today I used it on wet hair again because I&#x27;m out of my Alterna serum, and ugh, I have stiff, steel-wool hair!  I&#x27;ll apply it on dry hair tonight to see what happens, but I&#x27;m feeling pretty irritated at the moment!  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Made my hair grow back long and strong after multiple surgeries caused hair loss!  Can&#x27;t recommend it enough!!</li>
    <li> I use this when it gets closer to time for a cut and color. Seems to tame my semi-curly hair down, smooth the dry ends.</li>
    <li> This product takes my hair from looking dry and worn to looking silky and healthy in just ONE NIGHT. I have color processed hair (blonde - I lighten my natural color but also have some grey that I cover with the blonde color) and this product does not harm the color at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried everything else and still don&#x27;t have the hair you want, try this. If you blowdry your hair straight (like I do), I also suggest Living Proof Style Extender - my hair still looks great the next day when I wake up. The Alterna Anti-Aging Blowout Creme is also incredible for making my blowout style silky smooth, it just doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; as long as when I use the Living Proof product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell if received results from this product because I still have a lot left and I didn&#x27;t use it much. I think I may have wasted some money. I&#x27;ll update after I use a bit more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really quite impressed with this product given the somewhat mixed reviews, I have curly, thick, dry hair which is damaged due to styling and</li>
    <li> The best Hair Repair ever! Thank you.</li>
    <li> This product works wonders!!!  This is my third bottle.  You do not need to use a lot since it spreads quiet easily on the hair and base of the roots.  My hair is transformed overnight.  It&#x27;s that good.</li>
    <li> Totally changed the texture of my hair, just not in a good way. I feel totally scammed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed with this product.  I have used other Alterna Caviar products and been impressed by the quality and results, not so with the Overnight Rescue.  The only thing it did as promised was not leave a greasy residue on my pillow.  I applied before bed to dry hair, woke up and took a shower. My hair felt great when it was wet but as I started to blow dry it I noticed it felt like straw.  It almost seemed like the heat from the hair dryer was making it sticky and unmanageable. I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t wash the product out well enough. The second rinse god rid of the undesirable results but did not provide any of the desirable results I so badly wanted.  Will not purchase again!</li>
    <li> Not sure I like this product.builds up on hair fast . spent alot of money on it not sure I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was eager to try this product after reading so many favorable reviews about how it had made people&#x27;s hair so much softer, more manageable, shiny, etc.  I have been using it for nearly a month now, about 3-4 times per week, and I see no difference in my hair.  In fairness, I already use excellent conditioners and argan oil.  Perhaps if I hadn&#x27;t been using any such products beforehand, I would have noticed more of a difference.  But for me, I think I&#x27;ll invest in conditioning masks instead.</li>
    <li> I like it alot bc it&#x27;s overnight and it really does make you hair better, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, you have to use it 3-4 times a week plus another deep conditioner in the shower.</li>
    <li> This has been hair changing for me!  I have colored hair and highlights and have bee growing out some major bleaching damage which I have been consistently trimming but I didn&#x27;t want to have to cut half my hair off since it&#x27;s only shoulder length.  I have used this about 3 to 4 times and my hair now looks healthy and shiny, my split ends not even visible!  I wash my hair every 3 days because it is dry and the night before put a quarter&#x27;s worth in and comb through and when I wash the next morning, I see an immediate difference.  Will not be without this product and will cut back as my hair improves to maybe once a week or as needed.  This is truly amazing and I have tried a ton of products but this one made the real difference.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, you can literally FEEL the difference in your hair after the1st use. Could actually leave it in the hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it greasy, &amp; smells great. My hair is curly (uncertain on straight hair if it would be non-greasy) FRESH, not overpowering smell. Hope they never discontinue it. It&#x27;s the only hair conditioner i can say I love.  Highly recomend</li>
    <li> My ends are fried and this has helped them so so much! Definitely recommend! You do not necessarily need to use it at night!</li>
    <li> Did not notice much of a difference with this, but then again I had  been using the shampoo and conditioner regularly so my hair was already in good shape.</li>
    <li> The best yet/miracle working!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Didn&#x27;t have to have a glaze or conditioning treatment on my hair after getting my roots dyed. Hair is the healthiest ever!</li>
    <li> This stuff was okay would I buy it again no! I think I would put lots of conditioner in my hair and just let it sit for an hour and it would do the same thing. I think this would be good if you were traveling.</li>
    <li> This product leaves lots of texture in my hair.  No build-up. I would recommended for hair that has some age on it.</li>
    <li> This is a good product if you have dry hair. I have coarse/curly hair, getting worse in my 50&#x27;s, and this product helps soften it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, so many of these promised to work great fail. This worked very well and soaks in, nothing was left on my pillow.</li>
    <li> I do not normally write reviews but have to on this one. After going off birth control my hair started falling out...rapidly!&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything and after two months nothing was slowing the hairloss down so I ordered this. I am an avid Fekkai user but its just so expensive so needed an alternate.&lt;br /&gt;After just the first use my hairloss declined so much! Went from losing 50 or 60 at each shampoo to 3 this morning. Very easy to use and made my hair feel and look amazing! I cannot say enough about this product. I have never used Alterna Products but read about this one and figured I had nothing to lose..well except more hair! For anyone going through hair loss due to hormonal changes this is definatley the product to use!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I have thick frizzy curly color and chemically treated hair, so I&#x27;m prone to split ends and dry hair. However, this product has eliminated almost 90% of my split ends, my hair does look and feel much healthier. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, my hair absorbs the product really well and I&#x27;m completely satisfied. In addition, I noticed my hair has been growing much quicker than usual. :-)</li>
    <li> The first night I used this I put it on on 3 day old product laden dirty hair and went to sleep thinking this surely won&#x27;t be able to do much good on such dirty hair.  Was I ever wrong!!!  I washed and conditioned and when I was rinsing my hair it felt like silk in the shower.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever even  used a deep conditioner this good.  When I dried my hair, it looked like Katie Holmes hair on the ad.  This stuff really is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I love most all of the Alterna products, especially this one.  It really works great on dry/over-processed hair.  Makes your hair feel soft without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I like this line&#x27;s fragrance. Whatever it is, it smells like a great clean, fresh fragrance. Not too much. I wish it were a body spray! The caviar stuff works well on my hair. I tried the shine stuff (green bottle) and this one is way better, more moisture. I would continue to use this. It made my hair really soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not usually a believer in &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products but this overnight treatment really does leave my highlighted hair soft and smooth.  Effects last for at least 2-3 shampooings, too.</li>
    <li> The product works great. My hair is thicker and softer. I also use a little bit rubbed between my hands and smooth the ends of my hair in the am.</li>
    <li> Thank you very marh☺☺</li>
    <li> This product has a heavenly, clean and light fragrance.  And the hair absorbs it very quickly.  But I see no real difference yet in the health of my hair.  I will keep using it and revise as I notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen it work miracles for me. It smells good though.</li>
    <li> Great for my hair, does have a slight off smell but it works!.  Quick delivery, as well.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, and loving almost all of Alterna&#x27;s other products, I had to give it a try. I have straight hair that is extremely long and bleached white, and sometimes the ends look too damaged. I had hoped that this product would do for me what it seems to do for the other ladies here. Unfortunately it did not. Even after washing it out, let left my hair very wax-like with the residue. It looked as if I had not washed my hair in weeks; just stringy and unhealthy. I am still giving it 3 stars because when I gave the rest to a friend with ultra curly hair, she was very happy. So I think this is a great product, but reserved for you girls with gorgeous, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Last hair cut I was told &amp;#34;You have no split ends&amp;#34; by my hairdresser. In addition, my hair looks and feels healthier.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this bc my ends are really dry and brittle. I have long fine wavy hair that tends to be frizzy and I think after a few weeks of using this product as directed it looks and feels the same but I will ask my hairdresser what she thinks in a few weeks. Not worth the high price tag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on the fence!  I&#x27;ve only used it once. The directions are to use at night and wash the next day.  No real noticeable difference after once.</li>
    <li> i just started using this product and i already love it. I have only used it a few times and my very dry hair feels better already</li>
    <li> recommended, make hair shinning and smooth</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and so I took a chance and I am glad I did, This is some great stuff! Truth is I really need a haircut and my ends look rough! I used this and you can&#x27;t tell I need a haircut anymore. (I have an appointment, my hairstylist has surgery)</li>
