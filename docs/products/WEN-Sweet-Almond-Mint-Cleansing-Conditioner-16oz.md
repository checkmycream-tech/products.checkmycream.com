      <li>I love trying a lot of new products that I have heard of or haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to use to see what works best for my hair and what doesn&#x27;t look best for my hair.</li>

      <li>Your scalp will tingle and it is very refreshing.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very smooth and manageable!</li>
      <li>Works great if you use it correctly - for finer hair, use about four pumps and rinse immediately, and then use about four more pumps and let it sit in your hair like conditioner.</li>
      <li>My hair is very smooth and manageable!</li>
      <li>If you truly want Healthier Hair that people will notice is Shiny and Healthy, try this!</li>
      <li>I love my almond mint cleanser!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>I bought the whole kit with conditioner, masque, anti-frizz, and styling used them for a month and wasn&#x27;t impressed, my hair was still frizzing up after an hour.</li>
      <li>its okay but not as good as my home made non shampoo.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I would guess this product is not for women with very oily hair, for others, used as directed, it should be wonderful.</li>
      <li>Received a bottle as a Christmas gift and now ordered my own.</li>
      <li>But my hair never has been nice.</li>
      <li>Honestly.</li>

      <li>Im sure every woman knows that when your.pregnant your hair should be very healthy with all the prenatal vitamins you have to take, well this stuff made my hair fall out and now after 2years its still falling out</li>
      <li>The matching conditioner was just as  good, but better adding a more silky texture and moisturized feel.</li>
      <li>I first purchased this product through Wen and Loved it!</li>
      <li>This is by far the very best product I have ever used and purchasing it through Amazon make it very easy to get it...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I first purchased this product through Wen and Loved it! But the price was a definite Deal Breaker. I sent it back and kept the Trial size gifts. I&#x27;m so impressed with how my thick, coarse (turning/turned grey) wavy hair looks and feels that I cannot bear to use anything else on my hair! I&#x27;m sooo happy to find that I can purchase just what I want without the High Expense! As I said, I have thick wavy, and it&#x27;s also color treated hair. I do Not Ever have to use all the &#x27; Recommended Pumps&#x27;! And my hair is about shoulder length. The first time, it was Strange to put something on my hair that didn&#x27;t lather, but with hope and a prayer I pretended I was washing my hair. I rinsed it out completely and added some more of the Cleanser/Conditioner and left it on my hair for the duration of my shower. I rinsed completely again and was absolutely Blown Away by how Healthy my hair looked and felt for days! As I said, my hair feels so Healthy and it Looks Soo Healthy and Shiny that the thought of using any other product is depressing. I will use this for a very, very long time and Only until Something Proven Better comes along. And incidentally, the cost is much, much less than what I was paying for the &#x27;Best&#x27; hair care products from my Stylist or when I bought the Phosphate Free products from the Store. If you truly want Healthier Hair that people will notice is Shiny and Healthy, try this! You won&#x27;t be sorry! And if for some weird reason the Sweet Almond Mint Cleansing Conditioner does Not work for you...you can always trust Amazon for a full refund! You really have absolutely Nothing to lose!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year. Various &amp;#34;flavors,&amp;#34; depending on what&#x27;s on sale. Right now, this is the one I&#x27;m using. A few of the formulae are too heavy for my fine, silky hair. The way it works is the first use (or two), you use a lot of it, as per the label. After that, you will use half that amount. If I used as much as say on the bottle (or here), I would never get it properly rinsed and I would look slimy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has stopped both hair loss and itching scalp. I only wash my medium-long hair about every 4 or 5 days. My hair is soft, glossy and looks remarkably good, probably better than it ever has -- and I&#x27;m 68, post cancer and heart surgery. As my hair has gotten longer, I have had to use more than I did, but it&#x27;s important that your hair be very thoroughly wet before you put it in. Rinse it VERY thoroughly. You can use a tiny dab as a topical leave-in conditioner -- or not. Sometimes I do, sometimes i don&#x27;t. As it grows, I&#x27;ll probably leave a bit in so I can get a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s more work to use than regular shampoo and more expensive, at least initially. Long term, it is probably not much more than a high-end shampoo and the results are a lot better. It takes some getting used to, but stick with it and the results will amaze you.</li>
    <li> I like how my hair feels after I shampoo with this producy</li>
    <li> HAIR NEVER FELT BETTER</li>
    <li> I have long, very curly hair and I live in south Florida.  A recipe for frizzy chaos!  Wen has done a lot for taming the frizz and defining those curls.  Better yet, I don&#x27;t need any other product after shampooing and leaving in the product.  Like so many of us, I have a graveyard of partially used products under my sink.  so far, this is my third reorder and I love it.  I take it to the salon with me when I go because I only want to use Wen.  BTW, I have thick long hair and I use way less than the amount they tell you.  You need to play a bit to get the right amount for your needs.</li>
    <li> great for hair, does not help my dry scalp as much as some of the other fragrances do.</li>
    <li> My hair is very smooth and manageable!</li>
    <li> Let me say that after using this product 5 times now, it took the first 3 times to really master how much product to use, which for hair just passed my shoulders, is 10 pumps, I can see that 10 pumps per use, will make this bottle go fairly quickly. I have also learned that keeping a comb in there to help spread the product down the length of your hair, helps. I love how it feels, and now that I&#x27;m using the comb, I&#x27;m liking how it looks better than I did at first. Not seeing any less hair loss like some have claimed. Over all, I like it, I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s going to be worth the money. I pity anyone with long hair though.</li>
    <li> The does not appear clean after wash, it looks greasy, and even I have had question like &#x27;&#x27;is your hair greasy always?&#x27;</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  I used this product because I have curly permed hair and every picture shows a girl with frizzy hair and then after wen it&#x27;s magically styled.  lol This product is no better than many of the over the counter products.  In fact the product Big Sexy Hair is a way better product than this.  Don;t waste your money.  I also use Ion packets to condition my hair a few times a week which works amazingly on my hair.  Don&#x27;t believe the type on this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m absolutely amazed!! I will never use regular shampoo again. The itchy, flaky, oily scalp that I&#x27;ve suffered with for years is completely gone!! My hair is super soft and shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> It was great how fast it came in the mail</li>
    <li> So far, I like this product. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is b/c the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve also used  NaturOli Soap Nuts shampoo but I prefer WEN. My hair is blonde and naturally wavy. The WEN product leaves my hair feeling softer, shinier, and looks healthier when I blow it out compared to NaturOli. Also, I only use 2 pumps of the WEN product even though it says to use 16 pumps, I don&#x27;t find it necessary for shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> Ok this stuff sucked, I used it as only a conditioner with a separate shampoo because when used by itself my hair felt heavy and greasy. Im sure every woman knows that when your.pregnant your hair should be very healthy with all the prenatal vitamins you have to take, well this stuff made my hair fall out and now after 2years its still falling out and it looks thin now. Please dont waist your hard earned money on this crap its not worth losing your healthy hair over a $30 bottle of crap</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have frizzy hair.  It smells great, too.</li>
    <li> I was given a free sample for an honest review.  I like the concept of a shampoo/conditioner all in one for so many reasons. The mint smells and feels great, but my scalp stiil felt dirty... Had to use a shampoo.  Bit pricey for the amount of conditioner I use on my hair.</li>
    <li> Love, made my hair so soft and easy to style. will buy again</li>
    <li> I bought the whole kit with conditioner, masque, anti-frizz, and styling used them for a month and wasn&#x27;t impressed, my hair was still frizzing up after an hour. PLUS never do they tell you except on the bottle that you have to use 16 pumps for short hair 32 pumps for long, each pump is 1/2 tablespoon....you can hardly hold that much product in your hand! I now use Pantene damage repair cleansing conditioner, i use 6 pumps and Chi smoothing conditioner as a leave in and am very happy, no more frizz and my hair feels soft. If you don&#x27;t want to use the Chi as a leave in you can use Suave Keratin infusion leave in is great also.</li>
    <li> Not bad really really dislike the tmint in this. Made my hair soft but that was about it. Will probably try a different one that doesn&#x27;t have the mint.</li>
    <li> Excellent price - excellent product- this is the best way to purchase this item.......thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I would have given it more stars if it didn&#x27;t give me the craziest dry scalp!! It did give me pretty hair tho. Gorgeous hair and flakey roots? No thanks. I&#x27;ll go with clean scalp and pretty ok hair. It doesn&#x27;t give everyone this problem, but I saw that a fair amount of ppl did have it tho. Good luck if you try it!</li>
    <li> A rather amazing product really changes the texture of hair very silky</li>
    <li> Have used this WEN product for several months now and am excited that I don&#x27;t have to have automatic shipments through WEN as my short, fine hair ensures that my product lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought from Wen official site; didn&#x27;t live up to the claims they make on the infomercial.  I am very disappointed.  Pros: softens hair Cons: severe shedding/hair loss</li>
    <li> Do not buy. Not worth the head ach.</li>
    <li> Really did not work out to be what a commercial suggested.  Yes the hair ends up a bit smoother but nothing as fancy as you&#x27;d hope - and I have a total virgin not chem treated hair at all.  Is it better then shampoos - yes because it doesn&#x27;t dry you out as much, so that&#x27;s good.  But will it make your hair glamorous without additional work, or products - NO!  Be prepared to put more work into your hair for shiny glam.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but product was not effective on my natural African-American hair.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in how this worked on my short hair... it made it feel heavy and flat.  I even tried using it as a regular conditioner after shampooing with my regular products, but it still didn&#x27;t work for me.  After two weeks of giving it a good try, I returned everything for a refund. I was very satified with their customer service... I received a complete refund within a week.</li>
    <li> This product for me worked just like a regular conditioner, nothing special about it except the price. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and you may get a different result,  but this was my personal experience. Would not buy again and would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I tried this product after seeing one of the commercials on TV and have found everything they promised to be true. I have a nice natural curl to my hair, but does tend to get a little frizzy in the summer and dry in the winter. Using the Cleansing Conditioner, Replenishing Treatment Mist and Anti Frizz Styling Creme seems to nicely define my curl. I have also found that I have to wash my hair much less. Before I was washing it every other day and now find I can easily go 3 days and 4 days with a dry shampoo boost without it looking dirty or limp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find taking the advice of using 1/2 the recommended amount to begin with, lightly rinse and then apply the remaining amount works best. I bought this scent last, but honestly like the Lavender better, love the smell and tingle I get when using.</li>
    <li> I like the products but very pricey!!  My pump does not work</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly &amp; frizzy hair.  For years I&#x27;ve used pantene shampoo &amp; conditioner for curly hair and curls rock by catwalk for styling.  it worked great.  I tried Wen since I got a deal through swagbucks and was curious.  It was AWFUL.  worst hair days of my life.  I used as directed and had the frizziest hair of my life.  I tried using it with their anti-frizz product &amp; curl mousse as well as with my curls rock.  frizz city either way.  The only thing I did like about it was how detangled my hair was when I rinsed it out, but by far this is not worth the horrible hair I&#x27;ve suffered.  I will be going back to pantene thank you.</li>
    <li> This is not a sponsored post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this on recommendation of one of my friends who started using it. I hadn&#x27;t heard very many reviews with african american hair and was sceptical of spending $30+ on shampoo for my hair. But I bought it and fell in love. My hair is in its natural state and loves the cleanser. I don&#x27;t need all the pumps required and wash my hair less than I did before. I have way less breakage than I did when I actually used shampoo and even my most sensitive areas on my hair... the spots that always break of grow slowly have been doing so much better. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 weeks and expect the first bottle to last me at least 2 months.. probably close to 3. I&#x27;m pretty sure wen found a life user.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I have a short pixie cut, with one side almost shaved and the other side long, along with a bright pink panel.  I only use 2-3 pumps per hair wash.  My hair is also naturally curly and I use heat everyday to flatten it out.  Love this product.  Have been using it for a few weeks now.  My hair is very soft, blow dries a lot faster and my pink is lasting longer/not fading so quickly.  I still use a small amount of hair oil after I blow dry and hair wax to set my hair but haven&#x27;t needed hair spray for fly aways the whole time, that&#x27;s exciting!</li>
    <li> Very special product. Give it a chance and you will be hooked!</li>
    <li> good product, but its very expensive</li>
    <li> I love what WEN does for my hair</li>
    <li> Love, love, LOVE my WEN!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Agree with previous reviews. Loved it at first but started making my hair heavy and look greasy after a few weeks. This product may be best used as a conditioner after shampooing. I like the smell and it does make my hair very soft, make the color more vivid (color treated).</li>
    <li> Purchased Wen&#x27;s basic starter package directly from Wen. Made sure I only purchased the starter one-time-purchase offer, not the monthly auto send that draws money from my credit card each month. You can imagine my surprise when two months later I receive another package from Wen and learn I&#x27;m on their auto-ship program. I have to say that a call directly to the company&#x27;s accounts department was promptly dealt with and I was taken off their auto-ship program (though the wait background music was extremely irritating and jangling...). Point being, I was careful to NOT agree to their auto-ship program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product I would not say it is bad, but I didn&#x27;t find it great either. It&#x27;s simply a &#x27;good&#x27; product, which is why I gave it a 3 star rating. I have dealt with a scalp scaling condition off and on for years now and when the concept of a &#x27;cleansing conditioner&#x27; being used in place of shampoo really hit me as a possible way of dealing with scalp scaling, which numerous hair dressers had told me was probably the problem. Problem was I could not find a single shampoo gentle enough or free of drying or stripping ingredients to stop over drying my sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across a cleansing conditioner product sold at Walgreens and gave it a try. It worked! I thought I&#x27;d give the Wen product a try. It&#x27;s thicker than the product I was and still use. Also, Wen recommends using far more of their product than the competitor product recommends, which is really not necessary. Also, the non-Wen cleansing conditioner I use is half the cost of Wen&#x27;s cleansing conditioner products, and for me, since both do a good job of keeping my scalp scaling to a minimum, I&#x27;ll go with the less expensive offering with the added benefit I don&#x27;t have to use as much at each hair cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line being, go with the more easily available brand at Walgreens that costs half the price of Wen products.</li>
    <li> I had a friend get wen in a gift box when first came out. She loved it! I tried it and fell in love. My hair is thinning due to medical condition. So it&#x27;s baby fine. My scalp gets extremely dry in the winter so I get dandruff every so often. I will tell you. If I could afford this, this is all I would use. Due to financial decrease I had to cancel it. But my hair never has been nice. On wen though, I was in heaven. My hair grew, never fell out, wasn&#x27;t greasy or heavy. It was just amazing. If you haven&#x27;t tried this and want to I&#x27;d suggest trying the travel size first. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper. When I&#x27;m running low on shampoo and I see a travel for under $10 I&#x27;ll order that. You don&#x27;t need much in your hair. Especially me since I have short baby fine hair. Give it a try. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews discourage you. I&#x27;ve been using wen for years on and off, I&#x27;ve never had any problems. Well I&#x27;m not a fan of the fig smell or pomegranate, pumpkin or coconut (allergic to coconut) but the rest of the scents are great. I&#x27;d love to get my hands on the gardenia one again. And the tea tree one is phenomenal! Not scent but I love how that one is on my hair the best. If your hair is too greasy you are putting too much and not rinsing it out good. Sorry but it&#x27;s true. You don&#x27;t need much maybe like 4 pumps at the most. Put it in your hair before you clean your body then wait like 2 or 3 minutes afterwards, wash out. Most people take 10 minutes to shower, for best results it should be in your hair for 3-5 minutes. I usually buy the travel size on here and when I get a deal at sephora I get the big one. You won&#x27;t be sorry. Try it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t order this was it taken off my account better Not if so reimburse it</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I give the shampoo 10 stars but the packaging 0.  I use the product cause it works great and my hair feels amazing. But the pump is terrible. About half the time it doesn&#x27;t work and the product is too thick to pour, so it&#x27;s just a mess. You would think for the price they could make a simple pump that works.</li>
    <li> Sometimes I have to use regular shampoo to get some body, because this stuff does not lather and my hair can get very limp.</li>
    <li> Awesome my hair feels amazing</li>
    <li> Wen is a good product for a cleansing for your hair, this product rates a perfect 10.</li>
    <li> I lot of advertising, but this product does not work. My hair is better with pantene</li>
    <li> I like Wen products but this one makes my scalp irritated. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean with this one.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s so good for my dry hair.  And I like not having to by the whole line--just what I need.</li>
    <li> terrible product - results in broken and split hair</li>
    <li> WEN has made such a difference in my hair; even during the humid summer days.  Smoother, no dry look and I no longer need to use any conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love wen hair products makes my hair feel so much  softer! Thank You for your business!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t like this product! My hair felt dirty and my scalp itched. The fragrance is just so strong. Wen doesn&#x27;t seem to actually clean your hair. Seems more like a conditioner than a shampoo. I won&#x27;t order this again. Too much money for no results!</li>
    <li> tried it. love it. buying more...wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive</li>
    <li> I have been using the product WEN for quite some time now after I found that a lot of the shampoo and conditioners that I was using just wasn&#x27;t working for my hair. I love trying a lot of new products that I have heard of or haven&#x27;t gotten the chance to use to see what works best for my hair and what doesn&#x27;t look best for my hair. My hair became dry and brittle, the edges were damaged and I found my hair looking much dryer than it should be. I can honestly say when I buy a shampoo from any company I also like having the matching conditioner as well. So, I bought them as a two-pair set and immediately I was excited to use these products because of the raving reviews from customers. I bought WEN and the next morning I used both of them and I have to say my experience was enchanting! The shampoo just made my hair feel healthy, soft, moisturized and helped me a lot with my hair being dry. The matching conditioner was just as  good, but better adding a more silky texture and moisturized feel.</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I first started using it.  Then people were coming out saying their hair was falling out.  I did notice an increase of hair in my drain.  I stopped using it for 4 months and used something else and my hair stopped falling out.  I quit using it but now I can&#x27;t return 2 of my unused bottles as it is passed the return period.  So if anyone wants them you can have them.  But I am not satisfied with Wen like I was when I first started using it.</li>
    <li> Bottom line: Greasy feeling. Smells good.. but that&#x27;s all. I&#x27;ll use as a conditioner so it&#x27;s not a complete waste of $. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> My hair looks healthy and less fly-aways.  Might be a little heavy for fine hair.</li>
    <li> It is great for fine hair.  It makes it healthy and shiny.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
    <li> I love it so much. The only bad thing about it is that you have to make sure you&#x27;ve thoroughly washed it out or your hair will be greasy.</li>
    <li> Love this Wen cleansing cream.  Works great for my fine hair.  Gives my hair lots of shine, too.</li>
    <li> Did not like it at all, waste of money please dont buy</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but lately had to take a brak; wasn&#x27;t working like usual.  wil pick back up in the fall but does not help with south&#x27;s humidity.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome!! Just wish it was cheaper so I could use it all the time!!  :-(</li>
    <li> A bit overpriced but it&#x27;s a good product and I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I use less than it says - about 5 pumps- but I have thin hair. Also put on a pump after shampoo as a leave in conditioner . I have very processsed hair it makes a huge difference I can grow it out now.</li>
    <li> its okay but not as good as my home made non shampoo.  A bit costly too.</li>
    <li> I honestly love wen, and I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I don&#x27;t remember where I read it, on their website or in a brochure, but the recommended pumps are are actually just suggestions and are suppose to be split into two washings. Like if it says use 12 pumps, you should do 6 pumps and rinse, then 6 pumps again and rinse. But only if needed. I&#x27;m only using half of the suggested 12 pumps for my hair, and no dirty or greasy feeling at all. And I don&#x27;t have to wash it but once a week! Hope this helps someone, too much product will definitely weigh your hair down!</li>
    <li> My hair is very smooth and manageable!</li>
    <li> Not as advertised.  My hair was dull, greasy feeling and lifeless.  It took several washings with my regular shampoo to get this stuff out.  The cost is quite high when you factor in the insane amount of product that you have to use.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Ever since I started using WEN my hair is silky and looks healthy. I&#x27;m a bleach blonde...my hairdresser says I&#x27;m his only blonde that isn&#x27;t dry and damaged. WEN is a miraculous product. It changed my hair in one wash.</li>
    <li> Made my hair both greasy and dry, I wouldnt have thought that was possible. I was SO disappointed. Matrix makes a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; I have since tried which works GREAT. Save your money and don&#x27;t fall for the hype as I did!</li>
    <li> This product has made my hair so much softer and more manageable!! I have always needed detangler or had a lot of difficulty combing my hair, and with Wen the comb just glides right through. I highly recommend it for people with normal to dry hair, but if you have oily hair, proceed with caution. Certain areas of my hair still get oily throughout the course of the day, and if I miss a wash it is very noticeable. Other than that, wonderful product!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product, but that&#x27;s all I love about it. I&#x27;ve been using the product for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;m very disappointed. I understand that there might be an adjustment period for my hair, but I&#x27;m not okay with looking like haven&#x27;t showered in weeks when I actually just showered less than 3 hours ago. At first I thought I wasn&#x27;t getting all of the product out of my hair, but now I&#x27;m beginning to see that it&#x27;s just oil building up in my hair and weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking for some more information online, I found reviews from many different women claiming that they had issues with losing their hair!!!! I&#x27;ll be going back to my cheap, smell good, drug store, S**ve shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, however my hair seemed greasy and heavy after a few yses. Also I had to use ALOT of the product in my hair. I have chemically treated hair that falls  2 inches below my shoulders. The amount I had to use to comb threw my hair was ridiculous! ! At 32.00 a bottle I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my long and curly hair. I&#x27;ve used it for many years!</li>
    <li> Works as it is, a little goes a long way, will be order more of this, difficult to find local, glad Amazon sells this</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for over a year now.  I have very fine, straight hair just past my shoulders.  I use a blow dryer and hot rollers regularly.  Wen has cut down on the hair loss and breakage, and left my hair in much better condition.  I also love changing the scents to go with the seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said however, DO NOT buy this product from the Wen website!  They will lock you into a contract that it is impossible to get out of.  If you actually get through to someone to cancel your subscription, they won&#x27;t give you anything in writing and will continue to send you stuff you don&#x27;t need and charge you a fortune.  You can get all the products at Amazon, usually cheaper and often with free shipping.</li>
    <li> My hair is more manageable.  Seems cleaner and more vibrant.  Glad I tried this product</li>
    <li> I bought this a month and half or more ago and waited to write a review until I had used it for a while, at first I loved it. My hair felt soft and smooth epically when wet right after shower. But over time as it would let it air dry it would seem more and more dry and tangled. I have blonde loose spiral curls, they looked good wet but horrible when hair dried. It just was getting worse even when using webs other products,even tried the sixthirteen kind. Bottom line it&#x27;s not better than washing with regular shampoo and conditioner so don&#x27;t waste the money.the key to beautiful hair is a good quality conditioner( doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive ) put it in your hair when dry before you step in shower, take a relaxing soak in the tub or watch tv while it sits, then rinse. That&#x27;s it, no shampoo. Maybe once a week at most if you must shampoo. But I hardly need to use shampoo now that I do this. My hair is soft, my curls are coming back and not a drop of grease.  The conditioning  rinsed the dirt out and putting it on dry hair not wet allows it to absorb the conditioner.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair fall out!</li>
    <li> Absolute worst product ever! Had my hair colored two days before using it; which is normal for me, to shampoo my hair then, even the next day after color. It completely took the new color out - the gray roots were very prominent and my hair texture is absolutely awful. I have very shiny and silky hair; it is now like straw and looks burned, not to mention the fact that my hair has thinned out considerably in my bangs! It&#x27;s been about four weeks and I have been deep conditioning my hair with my usual Pantene which I have used for years and am getting some of the softness and shine back. I am due for another color next week and I certainly hope my hairdresser can work miracles! When I told her I was going to use Wen, she gave me the impression that it was not a good idea - should have gone with the vibes that I got from her. I have lost all respect for the &amp;#34;actresses&amp;#34; who tout the wonderfulness of this product and how they would never use anything else - shows nothing but greed on their part and the man who has created this product is ripping people off - 32 dollars for a bottle of shampoo? In this case, monetarily speaking, &amp;#34;less is best&amp;#34;. Don&#x27;t waste your money. As a final note, I am so glad I purchased this through Amazon as their return policy is the greatest. After I ruined my hair, I went online and googled reviews (should have done that first) - and there was everything from dried and damaged hair to many people with hair falling out! Those who bought directly from the company had a very hard time with customer service trying to get refunds, etc.. Thank you, Amazon, for your great customer care!</li>
    <li> I did not experience the results I hoped for in taming the frizz. Will not be buying this product again. In addition, it requires a large amount for each shampoo - the bottle will be gone soon!</li>
    <li> My hair is not softer or shinier after using this product.  Also, if it gets on my face, it burns.  Stopped using it and won&#x27;t try this line of hair care again.</li>
    <li> Giving it 2 stars because the pump does not work but the actual product is nice. I bought a travel size portion at Sephora because I didn&#x27;t want to commit to the much more expensive larger size if it was something I didn&#x27;t like. However  I do like the product and my brush combs through my wet hair so easily without tangles or breakage. I have less frizzy hair during the day which is great.  I also like it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 product so for those days when I&#x27;m in a hurry it&#x27;s a time saver.  I was excited when my Amazon order arrived yesterday.  I wanted to use the product today but the pump doesn&#x27;t work.  Yet another fantastic piece of plastic junk from China. No instructions on the top of the pump like other products with a pump would have like an arrow and a &amp;#34;push and turn&amp;#34; type thing. Nothing.  So I tried for 10 minutes pushing one way and turning, and then the other. Tried pulling it and the cap came off.  Giving this a 2 star rating just because of the cheap China pump.  I doubt Amazon will send me another so now I&#x27;ll have to put the product in another container with a pump - which will be difficult since the product is thick and not liquid like other shampoos.  Too bad because I would have given this a better rating for sure.</li>
    <li> I have about finished my first bottle of the cleansing conditioner.  Since the pump didn&#x27;t work I have just put a certain amount in my hand and have not used the # of pumps noted on the bottle.  I did follow the directions using the two applications and leaving the second one on until finished with my shower.  Thus far I have found it to be a positive product.  I was having to wash my hair daily if I wanted it to look decent and with this I have been able to go two or three days.  I haven&#x27;t used the full amount as the bottle directs but have had good results.  If anything I have noticed that my hair doesn&#x27;t seem as thin.</li>
    <li> Its AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product I will continue to use - leaves hair soft and smelling good!</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> Much better hair ,fuller, more healthy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sold. I loved this product when I was visiting my friend in Nebraska but the water is much softer there. Here in LA I find myself still having to use anti-frizz products to combat frizz &amp; dryness. Perhaps the humidity we had this summer has something to do with it but I&#x27;m about ready to go back to regular shampoo &amp; conditioner. I feel this product is like diets. It works for some but not everyone.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago and loved it! I just purchased it and something has changed - for the worst. After I use this product and rinse it out, my scalp seems irritated and overly tingly. This feeling continues long after I have dried my hair. I feel there is either too much mint (or they have changed their mint component) or there is too much alcohol. This seems to counter what Chaz Dean is trying to accomplish - a gentle cleanser for your hair.</li>
    <li> I first bought this cleansing conditioner in the Sweet Almond Mint kit. I didn&#x27;t use the other products, as I din&#x27;t like them, they felt too heavy in my hair, but I usually don&#x27;t use styling products anyway. I soon noticed that after only one day, my hair would look greasy. I can usually get away with washing my hair every other day, and even on the third day if necessary, but with this stuff, I had to wash daily. I called the company and described my problem and they sent me a free replacement of the Cucumber stuff, but I had to return the empty bottle of the Almond stuff.  After rinsing thoroughly, I still had the same problem. My hair stylist also noticed I wasn&#x27;t getting all the WEN out. It&#x27;s difficult to wash out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after doing some research, I immediately stopped using WEN altogether. Many women are suing Chaz Dean (the creator of WEN) because their hair is falling out in clumps! I also realized, all around my natural part, my hair is extremely thin, making my part look very wide. It was NOT like this a month ago, and at age 40, I am too young to start losing my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are using this product, I urge you to STOP IMMEDIATELY! Go out and Google &amp;#34;Wen Hair Loss&amp;#34; and you will see numerous links to law suits for WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
    <li> I was so excited to begin to order the Wen kit on their website, but you have to read the fine print. After you make your purchase, they will send you more Wen about a month or two later and charge you on the same card you used the first time for your first supply. I went through so much bs calling two different numbers to tell them that I do not want this auto delivery. I specifically wanted just one supply but I was getting too impatient with Wen. When you agree to the terms and conditions, you are agreeing to pretty much spend more and more each and every month. That is how they make their money. But I went into deep research into this product. Women are suing Chaz Dean for his product because they are noticing his product is causing hair loss and bald spots. Don&#x27;t take a risk. Coming from a person who hasn&#x27;t even tried the product, you&#x27;re probably not going to listen to me, but it is a true story if you look it up on usa today. I don&#x27;t trust their advertising at all.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical. But, I admit that I&#x27;m sold on WEN. I can&#x27;t believe how nice my hair feels. I&#x27;m so glad I tried this, I love what it has done for my hair.</li>
    <li> I hated this product because it made my head itchy. You also have to use about 14 pumps of the product. Differently not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel dirty.  Love the smell though and it probably protects the hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have short hair, but this is &amp;#34;the bomb&amp;#34; for any length hair. and this IS the same formula that you can buy via TV.</li>
    <li> I Don&#x27;t like this at all! It leaves my hair feeling like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in Days!  I put a little of this in my conditioner just to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> This made my hair rather dry.  I prefer the Lavender which seems to work better for my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who loves it and couldn&#x27;t find it at a good price anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Best hair product for my hair.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  One bottle lasts me several months so being able to order on a as needed basis works for me.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with this product. It does not clean your hair. You have to use a lot each time. I guess it is good for very dry curly hair, not for normal/oily hair. Real fiasco.</li>
    <li> This came highly recommended by a friend, so even though I was satisfied with my hair and what I had been using, I thought - &#x27;hey, it might be even better !&#x27;  So I purchased this very expensive conditioning cleanser and gave it a spin.  My hair is short and tends to wave, which I don&#x27;t like and have found ways to minimize the wave to work in my favor and not be prominent.  The first time I tried the WEN I used my usual after shower mousse (on towel dried hair) and thought my hair felt wonderfully nourished, but still a bit uncontrollable in the wave department, and it also made my hair not have as much &#x27;substance and loft&#x27; as usual - but it was very soft.  So my friend told me I shouldn&#x27;t be using any product on my hair  - that that would negate the benefits and feel with just the Wen by itself.  So the second time I tried it I used no product - no anything.  Again - it was soft and felt beautifully nourished, but the wave was back in spades and the rest of my hair was flat and not as I like it to look.  I&#x27;ll use it from time to time as a conditioning product (when I&#x27;m staying home :-) but I won&#x27;t be buying this again.,</li>
    <li> All I can say it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product to make your hair very managable</li>
    <li> I ordered this shampoo just got it in the mail and upon opening the box there was shampoo spilled in the bottom. When I pulled the bottle out the top was broken. I paid $32 for something that is broken and useless.</li>
    <li> Beautiful hair without shampoo.  It works.  A lot of shine and highlights.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! A friend gave me the 2 oz gift trio and the cleansing conditioner was so wonderful I had to get the large bottle. My hair is on the shorter side so I only have to use about a 50c piece sized dollop each time. I expect this bottle to last a few months.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but this doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as it used to. Did they change the formula? Can&#x27;t figure out what is different, but rather than being lovely and full of volume, after using this my hair is limp and gets greasy pretty quickly. Bummed as I LOVED this product so much before!!</li>
    <li> Eh.... 27 PUMPS??  I have long, thick hair.  The instructions advise to use even more for that.  Too much hassle.</li>
    <li> Trial awesome!  Judybpnebisr hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> Just to say this isn&#x27;t for everyone. Three weeks in I still looked greasy and homeless. Could not keep trying to hope it might get better, my hair looked just awful.</li>
    <li> Good product but too expensive for its value</li>
    <li> WEN is the best ever.  My first purchase was through the TV commercial.  I got sucked into that Auto-Shipping and had a heck of a time to cancel out of getting this product.  I am so very happy that Amazon is carrying this.  Before I started using this product hair was very thick and hay like.  It is now so very soft and I actually have a natural curl or wave to it that actually lasts.  After using Wen for a couple of weeks my husband decided to try it.  He won&#x27;t go back to shampoo again.  His hair is so soft and shinny now.  Thank you Amazon for picking up this product line.</li>
    <li> Before you buy this product please go check out consumer reviews.  I used this product for quite a while and noticed that my hair was really thinning.  When I complained about this to a hairdresser she told me that many people had complained about it to her and that the reviews were not good and that there was actually a lawsuit against them. I wish that I had known this before my super thick hair thinned.  Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> I use this all the time - love it.</li>
    <li> Awful!!!  I used this for 30 days EXACTLY as directed. My hair felt dirty and heavy. Save your money.  I didn&#x27;t order it through Amazon, but I thought this would be seen by more shoppers on this site.  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Love this...I panic when I run out!  When I blow dry my hair in layers, this product keeps my layered cut lying perfectly for 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I have a type of hair most dream about, not to thick or thin. I only have to wash my hair twice a week. I got this thinking it would make my hair even better read the reviews &amp; thought I would give it a chance. I used it once and it was the day after I had washed my hair &amp; it wasn&#x27;t any soft and didn&#x27;t look better. 4 days later I washed with Wen and started to blow dry my hair, it truly felt more dirtier before I had washed my hair. I did my best to work with it &amp; had to wash my hair with normal shampoo to be able to do anything with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;A waste of $26 Never again not in this lifetime</li>
    <li> I can see and feel a difference with the first use, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair fall out and ruins color</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product and the prompt delivery</li>
    <li> This is my second time using Wen. Received a bottle as a Christmas gift and now ordered my own. Very good product for my hair</li>
    <li> I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Love the shampoo, but it is too expensive.  Have started to look on how to make my own.</li>
    <li> I decided to buy wen because  my naturally curly hair and NYC humidity hasn&#x27;t been  getting along. I am a black (hispanic/carribean) woman with color treated 3c/4a hair. The last time I used Wen my hair was texturized (kiddie relaxer) and it  softened, conditioned, decreased shedding, strenthened, and retained the color of my hair.  So I  figured I would try it on my natural hair as it seriously needed a remedy.  I do not use Wen as prescribed because my hair is way too long and thick for a few pumps.  I feel it out as I go, sectioning my hair into 4-6 parts and heavily conditioning each. I instantly felt the smoothing and repairing of my frizzy and dry hair. I then braid or twist each part.  Then I let the conditioner sit for anywhere to 10 min.- 24 hours, I then rinse it out (not all of it).  My curls were poppin lol shiny, moisturized, smooth (little to no frizz) .  Wen brought my hair back to life.</li>
    <li> Smells good but that&#x27;s it. Hair always flat and looks oily. Sorry I bought it. For the record, I have thick hair.</li>
    <li> Newly permed hair was soft and lovely...and that is the first time I could say that.  This stuff is wonderful?</li>
    <li> For the price of this cleansing conditioner, I expected waaaaaayyyy better.  I have long hair, and according to the bottle, I have to use about 20 pumps to get the best results.  If this is supposedly high quality, why do I need to use a ridiculous amount of it for it to work?  It doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  I do like the smell of it, but after a few uses, my hair felt weighed down and not as shiny as it used to look.  I have thick, coarse hair so I was hoping for it to make my hair smooth, silky and feeling lighter.  It almost feels like it leaves a residue behind.  I&#x27;m only finishing the bottle because it was so expensive, then I&#x27;m going back to my regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical cause of all the bad reviews i read. I&#x27;m so so happy i didn&#x27;t listen to the reviews to make my decision to try it. OMG  I LOVE WEN. After using product my hair was so soft and silky and frizz free. Love love love.</li>
    <li> not like add says.  directions for short hair 15-17 pumps .  REALLY!!!</li>
    <li> Love it! My hair is definitely much better, soft but has added volume, and so is my daughter&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> it made my hair very greasy i was so disappointed</li>
    <li> I love my almond mint cleanser!</li>
    <li> 16-24 pumps per wash for long hair equates to about five times of washing your hair... for $32. It claims you won&#x27;t have to wash it as much, but I go to the gym five days a week so regardless of that claim, I do have to wash my sweaty hair lol.  Product is good, its the enormous amount you are instructed to use that makes this not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This product is more expensive, however, the result is wonderful for my thick hair. It has a great aroma as well. My scalp is not dry any more and does not itch. My hair is shiny, soft, and just lovely--many say. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for over a year now. I have very fine, straight hair just past my shoulders. I use a blow dryer and hot rollers regularly. Wen has cut down on the hair loss and breakage, and left my hair in much better condition. I also love changing the scents to go with the seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said however, DO NOT buy this product from the Wen website! They will lock you into a contract that it is impossible to get out of. If you actually get through to someone to cancel your subscription, they won&#x27;t give you anything in writing and will continue to send you stuff you don&#x27;t need and charge you a fortune. You can get all the products at Amazon, usually cheaper and often with free shipping.</li>
    <li> I love the product will continue to buy this instead of regular shampoo</li>
    <li> Wen Cleansing Conditioner has truly helped my hair.  I find that I have less frizz in my hair, it is shinier and has volume also.  I often lose hair, but Wen has cut down on the amount of hair I lose.  The biggest plus with Wen is my hair color!  I have my naturally blond hair died a very dark brown and have violet highlights through it.  With normal shampoos, the violet highlights would be faded out within 2 weeks.  With Wen; the violet lasts until my next coloring (usually 5 weeks), big improvement!  If you use the recommended number of pumps, I find you are using a huge amount of it each time you shower.  My hair is quite short, so I use less than the bottom range for short hair.  I find it works fine and the bottle lasts longer.  I found Amazon&#x27;s price for the product to be close to what you&#x27;d pay ordering off the commercials with the added bonus of not being sucked into the &amp;#34;Auto-Ship&amp;#34; that the commercial signs you up for automatically!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this product before but didn&#x27;t want the auto order they send monthly. This works with all types of hair. The curl pattern is really defined with this shampoo and lots of body.</li>
    <li> WEN is an amazing product.  I gave up relaxers a little more than six months ago, and at first I thought I would not be able to obtain the smoothness and manageability being relaxer free.  However, at around the same time, I tried WEN for the first time, and I will never go back to relaxers.  WEN has left my hair shiny, manageable, and smooth.  I also really appreciate my natural waves.</li>
    <li> Prefer purchasing here rather than from manufacturer. Best de-tangler, I use on my 8 year old&#x27;s hair to get knots out. Makes hair silky and doesn&#x27;t wash out color.</li>
    <li> Tried it twice, made my hair heavy and greasy feeling.  No one I know wants it so I&#x27;m using it to shave my legs!</li>
    <li> Some of these review&#x27;s sound as if they were written by Wen&#x27;s competitors! Also women who say their hair is dry and also that they shampoo every day! They don&#x27;t seem to realize that they may be stripping their hair of it&#x27;s own natural oils, thus making their hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would guess this product is not for women with very oily hair, for others, used as directed, it should be wonderful. Wonderful too because you&#x27;re not exposing yourself to some of the ingredients in sudsy shampoos that have been shown to be carcinogenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have slightly wavy hair that tends to be dry. I sometimes use a flat iron for styling. This product is perfect for me. I let my hair tell me when it&#x27;s time to &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;  by the way it looks and feels. That turns out to be once every 5 to 7 days or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent. It&#x27;s like aroma-therapy! and my hair becomes soft, not limp, and shiny. It&#x27;s what my hair wants, it&#x27;s what I need.</li>
    <li> everything i&#x27;ve heard/read about this product has been true for me. my hair is relatively thin and i was worried it wouldn&#x27;t get clean enough or i&#x27;d have to wash my hair more often, but neither of those things are true.  i love it and will never go back to shampoo. my hair feels clean, soft and shiny and it seems to be minimizing frizz.</li>
    <li> Very expensive and did not perform any better than a regular conditioner that costs a fraction at local stores.</li>
    <li> A gift for my wife .She rave about it. But it only a short time duration..The advertising on TV didn&#x27;t mention it takes 20 pump for medium hair length.</li>
    <li> I just started using this.  A friend of mine gave me her left overs after she heard me complaining about my fried ends, dried brittle hair.  I&#x27;m hooked after a week.  My ends no longer look like hay.  I think this product is definitely for people like me...I have very dry damaged hair from over styling and dying.  My hair is also fine and there&#x27;s a lot of breakage.  My hair just soaks up the moisture.  So it&#x27;s safe to assume yours would too.  If your hair it not extremely dry it will end up feeling oily or heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair after one week already looks healthier.  I have been getting compliments.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I grew up in the 80&#x27;s, so I am a chronic hair (daily) washer.  I prefer this formulation over the others for my hair type.  I have color treated waist length fine textured but thick hair that is naturally curly / kinky and oily mostly at the roots.  Not so with Wen!  Moisture balance without heavy conditioners and my hair stays true to it&#x27;s bad curly / kinky self without looking like mannequin hair.  But!  I do co-wash every day and because of the cost, I definitely do alternate with the less expensive drug store co-washes (&#x27;Renpure&#x27; and &#x27;As I Am&#x27; specifically).  I have seen other negative reviews and have not encountered the greasies or my hair falling out, but every person&#x27;s hair is different.  I have co-washed within 24 hours of color because I am just that OCD and had no color deviation.  For my hair type, the Sweet Almond Mint is the best formula.  I would recommend to individuals wanting to go the co-wash route to definitely go on the cheap before you commit - whether it&#x27;s drug store formulas (mentioned above and also there&#x27;s &#x27;Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27; - which did not work for my hair).  I also recommend using slightly less product that the recommended use on the package as well as co-washing daily rather than less often.  I have noticed that Wen has sample packs as well, might be better to try one of those before you drop $ on a product sight unseen based on reviews.  Something that you have to know before you buy - it is not shampoo; it does not &#x27;suds up&#x27;!  Your scalp will tingle and it is very refreshing.  It rinses clean.  The smell...so/so.  Better than wet dog, but the end result is so worth it (for me, anyway).  Hope that if you try, you have as much luck as I do.</li>
    <li> It is too heavy for my fine hair &amp; made it impossible to style &amp; manage.  My hairstylist said it works wonders on thick and/or curly hair but unfortunately I am not blessed with that.  The TV ads state it is for all hair types.....WRONG!</li>
    <li> Did a study on WEN Cleansing product for days/weeks then off for days/weeks for a total of about two years.  Noticed hair falling out within days of use, even when not applying to scalp (which means only applying to hair from neck down).&lt;br /&gt;The results:  stopped using because my hair falls out (but everyone is different).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1) The first couple times of use, my hair was extremely soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Hair kept falling out.  MANY strands throughout the day and sometimes in very small clumps during shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review above is only on the product itself which has nothing to do with the service or delivery, etc.  So now, about the service: they kept delivering though we called to cancel.  This went on for months until we had to cancel our credit card.</li>
    <li> Wen makes my waist length hair soft, supple, and so easy to manage. I love the clean smell and the healthy way my hair looks and feels. I get so many compliments on the youth and beauty of my hair, and as a 63 year old, that is remarkable! Occasionally someone will even stroke it! It is one of the first things people notice when introduced! Definitely a subject of conversation. I love that Wen is made up of natural ingredients and I don&#x27;t need anything else but a clip for my hair!</li>
    <li> I only use Wen hair products now.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I have thick, long, and curly red hair and all this did was make it dry. I guess it works for some people but not for others. It does smell fantastic though. My other complaint is that for long/thick hair they want you to use like 1/4 of the bottle every time! At that rate, and the high price, I couldn&#x27;t see it being maintainable in my routine. I returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair care I use now.  Regular shampoos and conditioners just don&#x27;t leave my hair as clean-feeling and soft.  I use it everyday, but use about half of the directed amount, and have great results!</li>
    <li> Honestly. I never write reviews but this product made me write a review for it. This has got to be the worst product that I have ever tried. It is like throwing money out of the window. It makes your hair feel nice for about an hour. It doesn&#x27;t lather up and it just has the consistency of conditioner. After that, it doesn&#x27;t feel like your head was washed at all. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week or so. I usually wash my hair every other day or so and I feel like I need to wash my hair again after a few short hours. Do yourself a favor. Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> I like the product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work can I get another one without additional costs</li>
    <li> As a cleansing conditioner, it is okay. I had to use more pumps per cleanse than with other scents. The scent itself was just okay.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It just keeps looking better each day. With long hair I don&#x27;t have time to shampoo everyday and this is the perfect product for that.</li>
    <li> Works great if you use it correctly - for finer hair, use about four pumps and rinse immediately, and then use about four more pumps and let it sit in your hair like conditioner.</li>
    <li> Amazing product - wish I would have found it earlier. I&#x27;m definitely purchasing again in the future and more products</li>
    <li> Love this product works great on my mixed curly hair</li>
    <li> It smelled great, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair. It left it greasy feeling and very ratted. Returned with no problem.</li>
    <li> Hair remains greasy after washed. No matter how much shampoo you use, or how thoroughly you rinse.</li>
    <li> It made my hair smooth and shiny, which is good in the summer time when I swim a lot.  Took one star off because of the price.  Took another star off because the pump failed to get 1/5 of the product out.  For that much money, i would like to be able to use all of it instead of leaving 1/5 on the bottom of the bottle.  Perhaps a squeezable bottle in the future, Chaz?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen before, but stopped because it was too expensive. It&#x27;S nice being able to purchase from Amazon, rather than directly from the company. I like the product. I have thick, wavy hair, that tends to be oily at the scalp, and very dry at the ends. Wen moisturizes my hair, and gets rid of the oiliness that accumulates after a few days. I don&#x27;t use as many pumps as the bottle recommends. I think the key is finding how much product works for you. I wash my hair with this every 3-4 days, and my hair usually looks fine until about day 3 after washing. I would recommend to a friend, I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. Also, I&#x27;ve found that most hairdressers are wary of this product. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I thought I should mention it.  Do what works for you.</li>
    <li> I love this Wen cleansing conditioner.  Easy.. 1 step cleansing and conditioner. Leaves me hair feeling so silky.</li>
    <li> Apparently this is the Gutar anchor version first 3 ingredients are mostly alcohol made my hair frizzy didn&#x27;t work well cost the same price I would never recommend this to anybody you must go on QVC or Chaz Dean internet to get the original formula</li>
    <li> I used Wen for several years, receiving the infomercial kits every other month.  The kit contained the cleansing conditioner in Sweet Almond Mint, the deep conditioning mask and the styling gel.  I didn&#x27;t use the mask very often and I hated the gel, so eventually I had a backlog of these products.  When I first started using Wen cleansing conditioner I didn&#x27;t use enough of the product and my hair never felt clean.  I eventually figured this out and when I was more generous, my hair responded really well.  At this time, my hair was colored auburn, which is a very difficult color to keep in the hair.  Wen definitely preserved my color and it left my hair shiny with lots of body.  Like I said, I used it for several years.  However, I really missed the lather of traditional shampoo so I switched to a sulfate free line and haven&#x27;t used Wen since.  I found an acceptable substitute in VO5 Kiwi Lime conditioner, which leaves my hair in the same condition as Wen for a LOT LESS MONEY!!  I can usually find VO5 at the dollar store, lol!  It works just as well, strangely enough.  But if your hair is dry and frizzy, as mine is, you will definitely love Wen.  Just remember to be generous with the product, otherwise your hair will still be dirty.  And you MUST leave it on for at least 5-10 minutes.  And rinse really well.  However, it will eventually build up and a clarifying shampoo will be necessary.  But then you can happily go back to using Wen with no harm done.  All conditioners build up somewhat and Wen is no exception.  Even before Wen appeared on the market, there was a small following for conditioner only washing (co washing).  I&#x27;m sure lots of these users wish they had invented Wen, lol!  There are now acceptable substitutes on the market and nearly every hair care line has a cleansing conditioner.  I also like Shea Moisture&#x27;s Co Wash, which works really well for my hair type.  But I suggest that you first try the original, Wen, to see whether it works for you.  Then you&#x27;ll be able to test and compare other conditioners to see whether something else might better suit your hair type.  It takes a little experimentation.  However, I heartily recommend Wen and remain a loyal supporter.  I just could no longer afford the expensive kits.  Now that I can buy just the conditioner, I might just go back to it.  It certainly worked well for me.&#x27;ll be able to test and compare other conditioners to see whether something else might better suit your hair type.  It takes a little experimentation.

    <li> This is by far the very best product I have ever used and purchasing it through Amazon make it very easy to get it...always in stock!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter. She loves it and it makes her hair look beautiful!</li>
    <li> Love love love this shampoo.  First use could comb through with no tangles.  If use regular shampoo it&#x27;s so tangled cannot comb without losing a handful of hair.  Wen I never lose hair, have tangles and looks amazing.  Get it!</li>
    <li> Not for me. Great fragrance soft hair but caused my scalp to constantly itch.</li>
    <li> Would have given 0 stars if I could... it caused me hair loss.</li>
    <li> LOVE It does taking some getting used to though. If not washed out thoroughly, could have that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; look. I&#x27;d suggest watching YouTube videos or going to the WEN website for tips. Prices are the same. I just like amazon prime when ordering. I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair Generally, people say &amp;#34; I can&#x27;t put my finger on it! but maybe it looks healthier?&amp;#34; It does make your shower time longer between the wash in and rinse out. I&#x27;d suggest adding an additional 7-10 mins in my opinion. I also have very long hair past my mid back</li>
    <li> Buyer beware.... The formula for this product was changed from my first bottle!! The first bottle was awesome, my hair was clean, soft, shiney, and fluffy. The second bottle was totally the opposite. My hair was weighted down as though I didnt rinse out all the condtioner. I did not change the process or amount used from the first to the second bottle. When I compared ingredients, the list was very different from the first bottle. I purchased both bottles from the same site, as I had read in other reviews that this was the end result that other women had experienced. Unfortunately, ordering from the same site didn&#x27;t assure I would end up with the same product!</li>
    <li> Love that stuff, plus it Amazon I&#x27;m able to purchase the one bottle at a time. Works for me thanks again Amazon</li>
    <li> Its okay. I don&#x27;t like that it has alcohol ( drying ) in it. My dog&#x27;s Tropiclean (2 in 1 luxury papaya) shampoo has more natural ingredients in it than this and makes my hair nicer. I&#x27;m sure its better than your average shampoo but ill stick to my dogs shampoo. better ingredients and price</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have used Wen for almost 5 years and it makes my hair healthy and shinny, I would never use Shampoo again!!!</li>
    <li> I am using it completely to replace shammpoo and conditioner.  Need to use about 15 pumps,spit into 3 time.  So far, much smoother to comb than previous.  I will see if my dry ends will in prove also.  I hope this Wen can be a game changer since I used so many brands with different products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t like the smell. I debating on whether to buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my Wen products, my hair is softer and shinier, people think I am coloring my hair.</li>
    <li> I tried WEN after hearing other people trying it out. I really like way it leaves my hair and scalp clean. I am hooked on it.</li>
    <li> Commercial sold this well.</li>
    <li> Using this as directed (as a shampoo) made my hair close to the scalp very greasy.  So I have been experimenting.  My hair is on the dry side so I have just been using this as a leave in conditioner which works better than anything else I have used.</li>
    <li> So far so good. Its only my first time using Wen and I can honestly say that was the most refreshing, &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; moment my hair has ever had. As I let my hair dry I notice its yet to become frizzy which is my usual struggle after washing it. Totally recommend. I&#x27;ll write a follow up 3 weeks from now.</li>
    <li> Great Hair Shampoo! Love it.</li>
    <li> My hair feels great! I have short hair no need to use much. I wish I got this when I first saw this product years ago.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so awesome.</li>
    <li> Love Wen. I have short hair and only needed about 12 pumps. I followed the directions recommending to use half first then rinse and use other half. I couldn&#x27;t believe the body and softness of my hair. Keep in mind that when you use it that it does not lather because it is not really a shampoo.</li>
    <li> if you have not heard, Wen is currently in a lawsuit over causing hair loss.  I never understood the hype about this product.  It&#x27;s absolutely terrible in every way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product b/c my scalp has been getting itchier over the years and I suspected the lathering of other shampoos may have contributed. I have been using Wen for about a month and just ordered another bottle. My scalp has stopped being so itchy and a HUGE plus, my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out as much in the shower. (TMI alert!) I have long hair so after washing my hair there was always a huge wad that had fallen out but now its just a few hairs. The instructions also suggest using 1 pump as a leave in conditioner. I only do that once in awhile b/c it tends to be too heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> Came on time, I love this shampoo</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore ths Wen products. They make your hair feel alive and wonderful</li>
    <li> Please please don&#x27;t buy this. I am mixed race and I have pretty thick curly hair. I wasn&#x27;t blown away with the results of using the product, it made my hair feel a bit greasy, but I kept using it because it was so expensive I didn&#x27;t want to waste it. A friend of mine warned me not to use it if I intended on swimming in salt water because it made her hair fall out, but I didn&#x27;t listen because she has very fine thin hair. Well last week I swam at the beach and since then my hair has been coming out in scary clumps. I had a baseball sized clump of hair fall out when I shampooed the first time after the beach, and I&#x27;ve shampooed twice since then and more and more hair came out. I&#x27;m terrified of what will be left if this continues. Please be aware of this before you buy !!!!</li>
    <li> Good. A little heavy for my hair</li>
    <li> it least your hair feeling very soft and very manageable</li>
    <li> Made me shed so much I thought I owned a pup, but nope, it was me. Googled it and found out this happens to some women. Decided not to take the risk of permanent damage and ordered an organic shampoo brand for hair thinning so I can, hopefully, reverse what I did to myself ):</li>
    <li> My hair is very smooth and manageable!</li>
    <li> So different from regular shampoo. Getting use to it</li>
