    <li> My 3 year old niece was SUPER excited about this Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like glitter in it</li>
    <li> Great gift for my daughter!</li>
    <li> My kid loves them.  Came fully sealed.</li>
    <li> my daughter will love this</li>
    <li> My daughter loves it, but I put some on an it felt like I was putting dirty Chapstick on my lips. So much glitter!</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery, everything&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Ordered 3 of these. 2 of them came opened and taped shut all over. Definitely not ok for Christmas gifts! Luckily was easy to send back.</li>
    <li> Not only did this come with the blister pack opened, but it didn&#x27;t even fit the product which tells me that it was never in the blister pack. There&#x27;s no way I can give these to my grandaughter. They look like they were decorated by a child with glitter. This is a product that goes on th  lips. I could never take a chance they were tampered with.</li>
    <li> I got these for my niece for her birthday and she loves them!  They are scented, glittery and Frozen themed!  What more could a little girl ask for?  I didn&#x27;t rate it a 5 because the package arrived with the cardboard not attached to the plastic front of the package.</li>
    <li> Kids really loved it.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for the kids to self promote their confidence.</li>
    <li> The picture was tough to tell, but the lid just sits on top, it isn&#x27;t at all secure. Obsessive child has already cracked it, but she does take it everywhere.The lip balm is good- lovely sparkly caps on the tubes, too.</li>
    <li> perfect gift for my daughter, she absolutely love the carrying case</li>
    <li> This chap stick was not like chap stick or gloss at all. It was more like a gummy bear consistency. It was weird. I&#x27;m finding chunks of it all over from my daughter playing with it, she clearly couldn&#x27;t get it on her lips so what better to do then treat it like a putty of sorts. Packaging was very cute though.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it!</li>
    <li> This set is too cute!  My five year old loves it!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my friend she loves Elsa i also love Elsa&lt;br /&gt;2 and frozen</li>
    <li> This is cute, and it&#x27;s Disney&#x27;s Frozen!  The hot item this year!&lt;br /&gt;I think Granddaughter will enjoy opening it and using it this winter.  Got a couple of different &#x27;frozen&#x27; bags she can put these in as well.  Along with the sing along dvd, and Disney book.&lt;br /&gt;Now if she can keep baby brother from eating them....</li>
    <li> my daughter loves these!</li>
    <li> great product - fast delivery</li>
    <li> Package was open upon arrival, looked like someone else had opened it. Disappointed was to be a gift.</li>
    <li> Product was great and my granddaughter loved it however when it arrived it was out of the case and  the lip balms were everywhere but this was a packaging issue.</li>
    <li> Made a great prize at our Elsa Party</li>
    <li> This is an adorable little gift. My daughter loves frozen and loved the glitter &amp;#34;lip stick&amp;#34; she calls it.</li>
    <li> Perfect ! my baby girl has very dry lips that causes them to crack especially with this cold weather, and does not want to use the regular lip baum. With this she uses it herself and she loves it....</li>
    <li> The Frozen 5 Piece Lip Balm was a big hit!  It arrived on time and made a wonderful gift to my granddaughter!</li>
