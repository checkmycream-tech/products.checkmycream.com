### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The good thing is when I send an email to the seller to let them know bout their product which I was about to return</li>
      <li>and I will buy more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of decepointed.</li>
      <li>once you start massaging, it breaks very easy.</li>
      <li>Made of very cheap brittle plastic.</li>
      <li>Satisfied with it</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic from overseas.</li>
      <li>It was made of cheap plastic.</li>
      <li>WAY MORE AND EATING RIGHT.</li>
      <li>The plastic is very cheap and the handle broke off the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>but if you are willing to work every day and don&#x27;t give up I am sure this can help anybody and even in server cellulite cases if you also work out and improve your diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels good, but not sure if it really did anything to help smooth out the dreaded &amp;#34;peel.&amp;#34; However, it isn&#x27;t doing any harm and it feels good on sore muscles, so... :  )</li>
      <li>THE PACKAGE OF THE ROLLER WAS COMPLETELY TORN UP, WITH ONE STAPLE ON THE TOP!</li>
      <li>I returned it and was pleased to get my money back</li>
      <li>I HAVE LOST ONE INCH OR MORE OF BODY FAT IN MY LOWER BACK AND STOMACH.</li>
      <li>Broke the first evening</li>
      <li>Life span of this massager was exactly 2 weeks till it broke.</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS,BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT ONCE OR TWICE</li>
      <li>too much work...</li>
      <li>BUT IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
      <li>, you just don&#x27;t see it as much on them</li>
      <li>so I could get a new one they told me they already did a refund for my purchase!</li>
      <li>I love this little gadget.  </li>
      <li>(aerobic, always have for years now) and have reduced my salt intake also and eat much more raw fruits and veggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easily breakable and will not last long.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so flimsy that you can afford to only glide it over your skin, which defeats the purpose in the first place.</li>
      <li>The point is clearly just to get you to buy it, not to satisfy the customer.</li>
      <li>am very disapionted, because it could actually work with longterm use and patience!</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this item, but now i wish i had bought the wooden roller instead.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this product is cheap and very simple and not a magic wond</li>
      <li>I was barely rolling it on my leg and one of the arms snapped off.  </li>

<li> Sigh :-(</li>

    <li> IT REALLY WORKS,BUT YOU NEED TO DO IT ONCE OR TWICE A DAY TO SEE THE RESULTS. I HAVE LOST ONE INCH OR MORE OF BODY FAT IN MY LOWER BACK AND STOMACH. I AM ALSO EXERCISING WAY MORE AND EATING RIGHT. BUT IT REALLY WORKS. I HAVE GIVEN IT TO 4 OF MY FRIENDS.</li>
    <li> Dollar store item.  Made of very cheap brittle plastic. Broke the first evening I used it. I feel ripped-off.  I truly wish that items like this were not sold on Amazon. The point is clearly just to get you to buy it, not to satisfy the customer.</li>
    <li> Came in a thousand broken pieces and it stinks - don&#x27;t waste your money - pure junk  can anyone say rip off?</li>
    <li> came broken in bubblewrap...no professional packaging or instructions. did not even take out of plastic it was wrapped in. sent response to dreambargain.</li>
    <li> My recommendation that if you buy this, DO NOT apply ANY pressure when using it.  I was barely rolling it on my leg and one of the arms snapped off.  I am deployed so I will not be returning it...too much work...so I bought some crazy glue and tried to fix it, in vain, because after working on it 15 minutes I realized it cannot be repaired...oh well, money not so well spent!</li>
    <li> So excited when my order arrived only to find out when i open the box with a bubble wrap it was broken! I guess it was th away it was packed and delivered! When the Post office got it they don&#x27;t care what&#x27;s inside maybe coz there&#x27;s no label such as fragile or handle with care! The good thing is when I send an email to the seller to let them know bout their product which I was about to return so I could get a new one they told me they already did a refund for my purchase!</li>
    <li> This cellulite control is made of plastic with 2 ends that get loose once you start massaging, it breaks very easy.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this item, but now i wish i had bought the wooden roller instead. I CANNOT BELIEVED THIS SELLER SENT ME ANOTHER PERSON&#x27;S RETURN. THE PACKAGE OF THE ROLLER WAS COMPLETELY TORN UP, WITH ONE STAPLE ON THE TOP! DO NOT BUY! am very disapionted, because it could actually work with longterm use and patience! UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
    <li> This thing broke IMMEDIATELY. Like, the second I opened the packaging, it snapped and scraped me. Would&#x27;ve been a waste of money at any price.</li>
    <li> This massager would probably work if it had a sturdier construction. It&#x27;s so flimsy that you can afford to only glide it over your skin, which defeats the purpose in the first place. Life span of this massager was exactly 2 weeks till it broke. Sigh :-( Back to skin brushing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of decepointed. After few months it was broken... So you shouldn&#x27;t buy it. Not strong enough for me.</li>
    <li> Well it does make a difference in you skin tone and you can actually see the improved circulation on you skin (if you have white skin) when you use the this rollers. my cellulite is not super bad and I am 135 lbs and 5.9&#x27;...so I am not considered overweight but cellulite effects even skinny people and even men, you just don&#x27;t see it as much on them and they usually don&#x27;t care,..... anyway after using this faithfully for about 3 weeks I did notice an improvement in my legs and butt...I have 2 of those and use them both at the same time (1 on each legs and butt) for about 10-12 min. a day while a watch TV....after using it for over 2 months my cellulite was hard to find, (I have to squeeze my skin really hard to find any bumps now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention though, I do also work out an hour 5 times a week (aerobic, always have for years now) and have reduced my salt intake also and eat much more raw fruits and veggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this product is cheap and very simple and not a magic wond but if you are willing to work every day and don&#x27;t give up I am sure this can help anybody and even in server cellulite cases if you also work out and improve your diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( Ps. I am using my husband&#x27;s account to write this)</li>
    <li> This product arrived broken into 3 pieces. It was made of cheap plastic. I returned it and was pleased to get my money back but I would not recommend this product to anyone. It is easily breakable and will not last long.</li>
    <li> I received when they told me I was supposed to be receiving. Satisfied with it and I will buy more!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money on this product. I got it and it&#x27;s just a cheap piece of plastic from overseas. The package isn&#x27;t even in English.</li>
    <li> It feels good, but not sure if it really did anything to help smooth out the dreaded &amp;#34;peel.&amp;#34; However, it isn&#x27;t doing any harm and it feels good on sore muscles, so... :  )</li>
    <li> I tried this for a while. I didn&#x27;t see a difference. I finally just threw it out. It&#x27;s a silly thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s already broken when I opened the package, and it looks like it was opened and used before. The package was dirty and broken.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I love this little gadget.  I could tell a difference in my ugly cellulite in only a few times of use.  I am also a  very lazy and it is absolutely effortless.</li>
    <li> The plastic is very cheap and the handle broke off the first time I used it. I taped it but it was never secure enough to use again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
