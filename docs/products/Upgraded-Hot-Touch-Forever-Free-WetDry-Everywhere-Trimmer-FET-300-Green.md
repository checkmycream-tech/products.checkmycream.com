<li> Ladies, you will not be disappointed with this Forever Free Trimmer :)</li>
<li> The first one lasted a few years but then just wore out.  </li>
<li> I have had three of these trimmers previously and they were no longer available from the retailer where I purchased them in the past.  </li>
<li> and I used it for a long time.</li>
<li> This is my second purchase  of this little razor - my last one lasted about five years.  </li>
<li> I always use it dry.</li>
<li> Wet or dry</li>
<li> it shaves without nicking you and you can get it wet in the shower.</li>
<li> After a few days, the back that holds the batteries won&#x27;t clip on on one side.  </li>
<li> Other than that</li>
<li> No tabs are broken- no explanation as to why the back won&#x27;t stay fully on (QC?).  </li>
<li> I do not recommend using the trimmer in the shower because mine have rusted in the past.  </li>
<li> I have anoteh one that lasted at least 5-6 yrs</li>
<li> And it does not make the hair growth worse.</li>
<li> This product is awful; it does not do what it is supposed to do.</li>

    <li> This is a great shaver and the price is awesome!!! Would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. Have 2 of them now. :-)</li>
    <li> Excellent buy love the new item cuts really close have the old model too.</li>
    <li> I ordered a bunch of these to have extra&#x27;s since they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  Works wonders.</li>
    <li> I like it, works great.</li>
    <li> Works great and is a very good value.  My second one.</li>
    <li> I this is the second Forever Free I owned, the other lasted 8 years. It is a great product, but this one is smaller and has more beauty. I love the convinience.</li>
    <li> My favorite. I cannot wax because I get rashes, but this is the best thing I found so far.  I always use it dry.</li>
    <li> The trimmer works very well BUT the mirror had what looked like an ink pen mark on it.  Also the brush to clean it with was not in the package at all.  This is the best thing that I have found to safely remove facial hair.  And it does not make the hair growth worse.</li>
    <li> This is a very good and useful Product.&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase another.&lt;br /&gt;It came well packaged and in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> alot of people say this is a rip off of the oriignal razor don&#x27;t care I bought it and it seems the same to me. I have anoteh one that lasted at least 5-6 yrs never had a problem with it finally died. works as indicated i have had no issues with it it shaves without nicking you and you can get it wet in the shower. shaves close to skin.</li>
    <li> I have had three of these trimmers previously and they were no longer available from the retailer where I purchased them in the past.  A quick search on Amazon led me to this.  The color is different but the storage pouch, shape, and size of the trimmer are the same.  The plastic is slightly lighter than the other version but the blade cuts just as good.  I love to use these trimmers while traveling and they are so light and easy to use that I find myself reaching for them on a daily basis.  The compact mirror that comes with the trimmer is nice too.  Batteries last for some time and are easy to replace.  They even came with the trimmer!  I do not recommend using the trimmer in the shower because mine have rusted in the past.  Other than that, they do a fine job for the price.</li>
    <li> Works well. However not as close a shave as a razor.</li>
    <li> This item is really great for touch ups.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase  of this little razor - my last one lasted about five years.  That&#x27;s pretty good for an inexpensive shaver.  I use this mostly on my face - I&#x27;m plagued with unsightly chin and facial hair and this is perfect.  Zippy, zip in the morning and I&#x27;m good to go.  Actually, I could go every two to three days but it&#x27;s easier to just groom on a daily basis.  &amp;#34;Forever Free&amp;#34; is the brand I look for.</li>
    <li> I had an older Forever Free trimmer for years and broke it, so I ordered a new one.  The new style is much easier to hold and use. Love the color choices too.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It does a great job and does not pull your hair.  Has a nice bag for travel.</li>
    <li> Older gals really need this.</li>
    <li> Wet or dry this is a nice product...would give it 5 but my last trimmer defunct...Like it well to order again. :)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my step-daughter who loves it.  She has been using it and expresses how much she appreciates this gift.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a must have for everyone in our house. We have purchased one for each of us. Works great for personal grooming.</li>
    <li> i gave forever free 5 stars because i own one already.it&#x27;s perfect for face i use it for my lip instead of waxing much better results. also very impressed with seller recieved it in 3 days thank you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my elderly mother who resides in a nursing home.  She uses it on her face (stubbly chin hairs), underarms and legs.  It removes the hair well, and is safe for her to use.</li>
    <li> Shaves nicely, good size in hand.  After a few days, the back that holds the batteries won&#x27;t clip on on one side.  Batteries and device still work.  No tabs are broken- no explanation as to why the back won&#x27;t stay fully on (QC?).  Otherwise, I like it.</li>
    <li> This product is awful; it does not do what it is supposed to do. I feel very cheated, if you need a product like this that ACTUALLY works, I recommend that you buy the other Forever Free product called: Hot Touch Forever Free Everywhere Trimmer (AWD-100), someone bought it for me through QVC. But I did see this product her on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really like this trimmer. I have had 4. I guess I wear them out.</li>
    <li> I like the trimmer because it is convenient and easy to use.  I always carry it with me.  It fits into my purse.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I have owned. The first one lasted a few years but then just wore out.  It does a great job getting rid of that unwanted hair all over.  I don&#x27;t recommend using it on your legs.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this trimmer. I had one like it and I used it for a long time. I decided I wanted a backup so I purchased another. It is amazing. Ladies, you will not be disappointed with this Forever Free Trimmer :)</li>
    <li> Wife says- Great product</li>
