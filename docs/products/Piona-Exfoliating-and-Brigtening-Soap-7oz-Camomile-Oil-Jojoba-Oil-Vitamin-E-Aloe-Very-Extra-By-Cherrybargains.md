      <li>Still working well to clear my hands.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I REALL Y LIKE THIS SOAP.. exfoliated well very well</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!!! I would give no stars if that was an option. This product works for SOME people. I begin to get rashes on my arm that eventually turned red using this and had to throw it away. Product is a waste of money and expensive. Don&#x27;t believe the hype!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it does exactly what it says. Definitely will order again!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I can give this no reviews... Doesn&#x27;t work at all been using it for a month two times a day.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap ever use it in combination of the cream and the serum  yay!!! It work I&#x27;m addicted</li>
    <li> I recommend using this soap with the Piona cream (the serum as well for extra fast results). Used by itself, this soap will not lighten you. It does not have any lightening active ingredients. However, it is a great exfoliator, which is key for lightening your skin so the cream can penetrate more easily.</li>
    <li> This soap has a very beautiful scent. I like the feel it leaves on my skin after a shower.</li>
    <li> Sounds like it is working as described. Burns a little after few days but I think that is because the skin starts to peel a little. I like this soap</li>
    <li> Love it. Exfoliates very well.</li>
    <li> Arrived and just as pictured.  Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me mayb I need more -shrugs, I&#x27;m African American also and light skin, maybe it would work for someone else</li>
    <li> Great soap I will use again</li>
    <li> I have tried every product out there trying to get rid of some spots in my face needless to say many dollars latter nothing worked.  I came upon this product by accident I must say it is doing the job I would recommend it to all my friends</li>
    <li> This can be used alone or with the lotion.</li>
    <li> Third time ordering and as always i am satisfied</li>
    <li> This soap does not work well, it is ineffective. The soap smells very nice but it does nothing for skin discoloration.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve  not use the soap yet because the little bit of the serum and the cream work only four days for me but am sure is really a sure thing too</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love how clean my skin looks and feels and the soap is a good thick size...</li>
    <li> Product is awesome. Did exactly what I intended it to do.Still working well to clear my hands.I love it and will recommend it to those who need it.Just too small for the price.</li>
    <li> Burned me Bad. I have good, medium/light brown skin. Im 22 years old, acne scars. Made them darker. Then made my face peel back to what it was before i used it.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It takes time for it to work so be patient but it works. Use a small amount</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much... But it&#x27;s working like a scrub for your skin. About the whitening... not in my case.</li>
    <li> Give the skin a glow.  Over all it a good product</li>
    <li> I usually put off writing reviews, always promising I&#x27;ll get to it...... But anyone looking at this product needs to know what I know now! THIS PRODUCT WORKS! It really works, I can&#x27;t stress this point strong enough! THIS STUFF WORKS!!! I&#x27;m wondering whether I should review it, now it may be out of stock more frequently, LOL!  I&#x27;m gonna stock up, I just now reordered! This review is for the soap and the cream! They work together beautifully! This product works and it works FAST!!!! I used it for my feet to get them sandal ready for the summer, I&#x27;m an African-American woman, and HAD discoloration around my ankles and the knuckles of my toes!!!!!!! HAD!!!!! Because the discoloration is gone, my feet are gorgeous!!!!!!!! THANK YOU to the makers of this fabulous product! It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives my body a good clean....</li>
    <li> This soap works great.  It works well in combination with the cream.  It is a large bar and lasts compared to other soaps of this kind.  The exfoliation is nice and really smooths out the texture of the skin.  I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because I think the smell is horrible, but if the smell does not bother you the product is A+  and worth your money.</li>
    <li> I started using Piona Brightening Soap a month ago. I haven&#x27;t seen any visible results yet. But, the soap makes my skin smooth; however, my complexion stayed the same.&lt;br /&gt;I will give another update after 3 months. I have to give it some time.</li>
    <li> Only been using a couple of days, yet some of my blemishes have already lightened. The soap smell good too, so no complaints.</li>
    <li> Be careful on soars, if you cut yourself shaving use a different soap. It does exactly what it describes, and like my skin feeling clean, really clean</li>
    <li> You can really feel the exfoliating effect after using. Make sure to have a good moisturizer. This was my first time using the piona line, but I quite like it and the bleaching cream! I can&#x27;t wait to see my long term results.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do as much as what everyone made it out to be. I used the entire bottle every morning and every night and nothing dramatic.</li>
    <li> Product came soon and works to clear up abrasions that come with shaving. It works very well and cleans better than regular soaps.</li>
    <li> I wash my body w it like the way it smell and moisturizer my skin</li>
    <li> This saop is great. And I combined it with its cream. I brought mine in a beauty supple store for $11 and some change. It&#x27;s more expensive on here. Cheaper in stores. Anywho, my face and neck was darker than my entire body. After a couple 3-4 weeks, I started seeing changes. But remember, I used the cream as well. That being said, my face and neck turned 3-4 shades lighter. I even had to change my foundation color...</li>
    <li> It did all that it said and more. I love this stuff! It brightened my skin beautifully. This is some awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> Use this for over a month.  I did not get any change just made my face break out and dry</li>
    <li> This product made my skin feel extremely soft however I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s any better than other soaps, except for the softness of the skin.</li>
    <li> I use it, not really sure if it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ll write another review when it runs out if I order more. I have the bleaching cream too. The bar is big, smalls fine, the lather is thickish. Its been about 2-3 weeks. The soap lasts for a while</li>
    <li> I thought the soap would make my freckles go away or maybe just lighten up my facial skin and arms. I have been using it for a month but I haven&#x27;t noticed a change. The soap smells good though  and is probably more useful&lt;br /&gt;for those with oily skin complexion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap in addition to the Piona cream for about three weeks now. I have seen very little improvement as far as my complexion is concerned. I do like the soap because it smells good and does not leave my skin dry. I will continue using both to see if I see any significant changes.</li>
    <li> Use with the face cream its awesome trust me I am a black women I was dark skin now I am lighter</li>
    <li> it works! when you buy piona soap &amp; piona bleaching cream together .  The spot ages are gone . like 1 or 2 months.</li>
    <li> Great Product but use sun screen when going outside</li>
    <li> This product will do the job, but be careful of irritation. It did dry my oily skin but left dry patches after a month use. Worked to fade some acne scarring but any fade cream would have done that.</li>
    <li> Little fir d price, had not seen results, still too early to know d effect.</li>
    <li> The pioneer exfoliating soap is a wonder soap bar, it does not only exfoliates but it also enhances your skin. I love it&#x27;s rich creamy leather, it lasts me a month plus.</li>
    <li> I love it!  It definitely has rid my face of adult acne.  I will order again!</li>
    <li> This soap is great I lover it.... My skin looks totally difference and I see a clearer complexion. The smell is great</li>
