### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect for my daughter.</li>
      <li>Very good they don&#x27;t break</li>
      <li>Great, I could not find these anywhere</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this item in stores anymore, so I&#x27;m glad to find them from this buyer.</li>
      <li>I paid more for the assorted colors as pictured, but was sent all hideous pearl color.</li>
      <li>These are good ponytail holders, but somehow not as good as similar I have had before.  </li>
      <li>They hold my hair securely without tearing.</li>
      <li>the best way to &amp;#34;string up&amp;#34;  thick....</li>
      <li>AND I agree these are not as good as the ones which were made several years</li>
      <li>These were just what I was looking for and arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>perfect, once they sent me the assorted colors after i had to send back the all white.</li>
      <li>My wife likes them because they are easy to use &amp; work great with her thick hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an adult, but I still love these ponytail holders.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got way too much hair to make these work.</li>
      <li>I love Goody Girls Twinbead, I have bought lots of other brands and just don&#x27;t work for me</li>
      <li>they sent one box in light pink, and the other box, light pearl.</li>
      <li>Sad, because I was looking forward to her having good quality, different colored hair ties</li>
      <li>(I usually use this kind of the swimming pool because of ease of unwinding) like others haven&#x27;t in the past.  </li>
      <li>The picture clearly shows the large size twinbeads, but the delivered package was the small size twinbeads.</li>

<li> although it said girls i still expected them to be bigger</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for, these were so tiny, and really not worth the price.</li>
<li> They still work the same way but the elastic is a little weaker and I ordered a mix but ended up with &amp;#34;baby pink cotton candy bobble&amp;#34;..... 16 OF THEM not the mix of colors that I ordered.  </li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere locally and my granddaughter loves the few her mother had saved from her childhood.  </li>

<li> These allow me to bind my hair as loosely or as tightly as I want.</li>
<li> They hold tight &amp; stay in place well.</li>
<li> I remembered using these on my daughter when she was little &amp; as they say &amp;#34;the rest is history&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> The quality is poor and not the same as they used to be.  </li>
<li> I say be very careful when ordering this mess!!</li>
<li> I have very long, thick hair, and regular covered rubber bands are difficult for me to use and get as tight as I like.</li>
<li> Poor quality elastic and they are too long.  </li>
<li> I have hair past my waist &amp; was very tired pulling it through a standard band.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I was sent all pink - not multicolored</li>
<li> They are made for someone with with medium to thick hair.</li>
<li> Someone with thin hair would have to wrap them around their ponytail twice.</li>
<li> , I get so frustrated because just when I&#x27;m about to finish the turn they bust</li>
<li> Very disappointed.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing!</li>

    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere locally and my granddaughter loves the few her mother had saved from her childhood.  These were just what I was looking for and arrived quickly.  Just wish there were some pink or white ones in the package.</li>
    <li> Very good they don&#x27;t break</li>
    <li> perfect, once they sent me the assorted colors after i had to send back the all white. They are not made as quality as they were back in the 70&#x27;s</li>
    <li> I paid more for the assorted colors as pictured, but was sent all hideous pearl color. Returned.</li>
    <li> They are made for someone with with medium to thick hair. My wife likes them because they are easy to use &amp; work great with her thick hair. Someone with thin hair would have to wrap them around their ponytail twice.</li>
    <li> Poor quality elastic and they are too long.  The length of the elastic is longer than described so they fall out of my hair.  The quality is poor and not the same as they used to be.  Very disappointed.  Gwen</li>
    <li> i was expecting bigger bubbles. the picture seemed much bigger than what was delivered.  although it said girls i still expected them to be bigger</li>
    <li> I actually got these for myself.  I have hair past my waist &amp; was very tired pulling it through a standard band.  I remembered using these on my daughter when she was little &amp; as they say &amp;#34;the rest is history&amp;#34;.  They hold tight &amp; stay in place well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult, but I still love these ponytail holders. They hold my hair securely without tearing.</li>
    <li> NOT WHAT I ORDERED!  Bobbles is what these were called..... the best way to &amp;#34;string up&amp;#34;  thick.... heavy.... long hair .... two twist and your done.  They still work the same way but the elastic is a little weaker and I ordered a mix but ended up with &amp;#34;baby pink cotton candy bobble&amp;#34;..... 16 OF THEM not the mix of colors that I ordered.  (The back of the package says mixed though)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I paid for, these were so tiny, and really not worth the price. I say be very careful when ordering this mess!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I was sent all pink - not multicolored AND I agree these are not as good as the ones which were made several years ago-- I need to triple wrap my daughter&#x27;s hair to get them to stay in.  Sad, because I was looking forward to her having good quality, different colored hair ties</li>
    <li> I love Goody Girls Twinbead, I have bought lots of other brands and just don&#x27;t work for me, I get so frustrated because just when I&#x27;m about to finish the turn they bust but Goody&#x27;s don&#x27;t.  I have looked for Goody&#x27;s ponytailers every place I go and don&#x27;t find them.  I wish they would still sale them in stores.</li>
    <li> Not the item I thought it would be</li>
    <li> These are good ponytail holders, but somehow not as good as similar I have had before.  They tend to get tangled up in wet hair (I usually use this kind of the swimming pool because of ease of unwinding) like others haven&#x27;t in the past.  My husband had to cut one out of my daughter&#x27;s hair.  At first I thought he&#x27;d unwound it wrong.  But then the same happened to me a couple of days later on our other child.  Kind of annoying.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter.</li>

    <li> The picture clearly shows the large size twinbeads, but the delivered package was the small size twinbeads. I&#x27;ve got way too much hair to make these work. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I bought 2 box, assorted colors as shown in the image. they sent one box in light pink, and the other box, light pearl. I did not want these colors, but mixed.</li>
