      <li>This is the problem solver for all ages, although its a kids product, my kids and I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many detanglers.</li>
      <li>what more do you need to know.</li>
      <li>and then when she gets out, a smidge more to leave in.  </li>
      <li>This is our favorite kids conditioner/detangler.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>Its better than any treatment for adults and its the #1 product for a kid who is scared to brush thru their hair after a bath.</li>
      <li>I should say that I know we use more of it each time than most people probably do.  </li>
      <li>It really does smell great and works well.</li>
      <li>it was no where near as good! )</li>
      <li>This one works AND smells GREAT and is all natural!!  </li>
      <li>My son has long hair with beautiful curls and this conditioner is amazing.</li>
      <li>Such a good product had to get for my wife as well, it also smells really good.</li>
      <li>It smells great and helps with my 4 year old&#x27;s tangles.</li>
      <li>Like a nice banana smoothie, Thankfully it is non toxic and conditions her tangle prone hair very well!</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine curly hair.</li>
      <li>Before I used Sprout Miracle Detangler &amp; it worked fine</li>
      <li>I just found it on here and ordered two huge 16oz bottles for Christmas</li>
      <li>I really wish it was in a spray bottle, but it&#x27;s nice for the bath also.</li>
      <li>, the smell also is upper good..</li>
      <li>I bought another conditioner ( more expensive, made for curly hair, looked good, smelled good...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff, it is seriously the best detangler on the market, plus it is very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Seriously this is the best!</li>
      <li>The smell to me is very strong but my 4 year old loves it.</li>
      <li>I would put it on my list of the TOP Ten Things EVERY</li>
      <li>Got this for my daughter to control her tangles in her hair, it makes her hair silky smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>:) That should last until Valentines day</li>
      <li>The ingredients are also much better for children (and adults) than the regular drugstore brands.  </li>
      <li>But Clean Kids Naturally</li>
      <li>I discovered this conditioner a few years ago and we LOVE it!</li>
      <li>I never usually post reviews, but this is worth my time.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Banana Smoothie Detangler</li>
      <li>but after I used it on her I decided to try it on myself, and wowzers it worked better than any expensive stuff you would get at any salon or as good as lush products.  </li>
      <li>Feels good to use a safer product than the typical commercial products.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair so silky and soft!</li>
      <li>We have tried many of the other natural kids products and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
      <li>We will never buy any other, and thats a true promise.</li>
      <li>Before this, I tried many disgusting smelling products that I would have been happy with, IF THEY WORKED.  </li>
      <li>I use a quarter size and massage her ends &amp; instantly her hair is very brushable.</li>
      <li>but this by far beats it.</li>
      <li>Not tight curls but curly enough that it gets really tangled after a hair wash &amp; getting out of bed.</li>
      <li>top is hard to open--my 2.5 year old cannot open it.</li>
      <li>Natural conditioners generally suck.</li>
      <li>I am planning on looking for the same brand, but with a different scent, because it does perform well on my daughter&#x27;s very tangle-prone hair.</li>
      <li>Both my kids have fine but thick hair, one child has curly hair.  </li>

    <li> I am not exaggerating when I say we have tried more than 40 products on our daughter&#x27;s curly, impossibly tangled hair!  Her hair is always a nightmare to deal with!  But Clean Kids Naturally Banana Smoothie Detangler has changed our lives!  We use it with a Knot Genie brush when she is about to get out of the shower.  We use a generous amount of this product and brush with the water flowing slightly on her hair to help loosen the knots...and then when she gets out, a smidge more to leave in.  Before this, I tried many disgusting smelling products that I would have been happy with, IF THEY WORKED.  My daughter has a lot of allergies, but I even tried chemical-laden products in an effort to tame her knots.  This one works AND smells GREAT and is all natural!!  What more could you ask for?!?  I have recommended this product to so many friends (With the knot genie) and they are HOOKED on it!!  It has worked for friends whose kids have entirely different hair textures and qualities...across the board!  LOVE THIS STUFF!!  Would give it 20 stars if I could.  My only complaint is that it is a pain to find it and with as much as we use, it is a bit pricey.  I should say that I know we use more of it each time than most people probably do.  Our daughter has a sensory processing disorder and cannot handle ANY tugging on her hair.  We just use a generous amount of this product and voila!</li>
    <li> I discovered this conditioner a few years ago and we LOVE it! IT IS THE BEST!! I never usually post reviews, but this is worth my time. A tiny bit goes a long way too! My son has long hair with beautiful curls and this conditioner is amazing. We use a small amount, as I said, and it truly works wonders on tangled hair. I was SOOOO disappointed when I could no longer find it in our local health food store. I bought another conditioner ( more expensive, made for curly hair, looked good, smelled good...it was no where near as good! ) Constant complaining during hair washing because NOTHING WORKS TO GET OUT TANGLES AS GOOD AS THIS DOES! I just found it on here and ordered two huge 16oz bottles for Christmas :) That should last until Valentines day and then I&#x27;ll order more &amp;#60;3 LOVE IT! I would put it on my list of the TOP Ten Things EVERY MOM NEEDS!</li>
    <li> This works well. I&#x27;ve tried so many detanglers. I really wish it was in a spray bottle, but it&#x27;s nice for the bath also. It smells great and helps with my 4 year old&#x27;s tangles.</li>

    <li> The best detangler/leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my daughter&#x27;s curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re OBSESSED with this product!</li>
    <li> I spend at least an hour combing out my daughter&#x27;s hair. It&#x27;s a nightmare.  Thanks to Banana Smoothie Detangler it&#x27;s less than 5 minutes with no more crying. Love it.</li>

    <li> Seriously this is the best! Before I used Sprout Miracle Detangler &amp; it worked fine but this by far beats it. My daughter has fine curly hair. Not tight curls but curly enough that it gets really tangled after a hair wash &amp; getting out of bed. I use a quarter size and massage her ends &amp; instantly her hair is very brushable. The smell to me is very strong but my 4 year old loves it. I still wouldn&#x27;t dock stars because of it. By far the best product &amp; I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>

    <li> Natural conditioners generally suck. This one is awesome, and it smells like bananas. what more do you need to know. :-)&lt;br /&gt;The top is hard to open--my 2.5 year old cannot open it. To me, that is another &amp;#34;plus.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Love this!!! It detangles like a dream and smells great. Great ingredients too! Also, a little bit goes a long way--I had an 8 oz. that&#x27;s lasted me over two years.</li>
    <li> I have been a user for many years, its great for adults but works magic on children.

    <li> This conditioner smells so delicious.  My daughter was about to taste it. Like a nice banana smoothie, Thankfully it is non toxic and conditions her tangle prone hair very well!</li>
    <li> The best at conditioning my 3yo daughter&#x27;s super-fine hair. Smells just like bananas too. But it still stings my kids eyes.</li>
    <li> It is the best detangler I used on my daughter, her hair get tangled so fast and now I can brush her with no cry, the smell also is upper good..</li>
