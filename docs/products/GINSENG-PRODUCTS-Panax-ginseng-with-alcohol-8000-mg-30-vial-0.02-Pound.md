      <li>LOVE IT</li>
      <li>I do notice an elevation in my mood and sociability as well if I take it before work, but I mostly use it pre workout now.  </li>
      <li>I like the taste of this one over others I&#x27;ve used and seems to have better quality control as well.    </li>
      <li>This is good for health, I have used this product off and on for years and since it comes at such a great price + free shipping for items over $25.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this would be a terrific product, if one can drink it; I&#x27;ve had great improvement in my energy levels with the 4500 mg, so I wish I could have handled this strength.</li>
      <li>A fine herbal extract.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so impressed that I can get 8 grams of Ginseng in each dose for so little money.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m grateful this company makes this product available.</li>
      <li>These high quality ginseng vials offer a nice non-jittery energy boost.</li>
      <li>glad you had this stock help me out with energy when i needed it thanks again for having this in stock</li>
      <li>Came a day earlier than promised and it is a good product, it is ginseng after all.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how effective this product is for me.</li>
      <li>the vials were 2/3 full</li>
      <li>were full ~</li>
      <li>Most GINSENG products are not pure and this makes them not so effective.</li>
      <li>I have taken Ginseng for years and have had no ill side effects (though never take 2 vials as it can upset your stomach, but at this strength, one vial is plenty!)</li>
      <li>but when my mom drank it she mentioned that it would calm her nerves</li>
      <li>Another benefit for me has been more sexual energy and harder erections.</li>
      <li>Better to drink straight and fast, chase with something tastier.</li>
      <li>Natural energy,a healthy way for that get up and go.</li>
      <li>It gives me more energy at 44 years old.</li>
      <li>As the owner of a natural foods and herb business for many years, I saw the popularity of these vials grow and grow.</li>
      <li>I feel strongly that I had much better mental clarity and memory during my work season (seasonal tax preparation) than I have had in years.</li>
      <li>I find myself very focused and full of energy.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more in the future</li>
      <li>Product is exactly as advertised.  </li>
      <li>THAT MUCH!</li>
      <li>This product is the real deal!</li>
      <li>There are many different Mg.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing benefit because I have been having trouble keeping an erection.</li>
      <li>Came very well packaged.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line is there were no broken vials</li>
      <li>Any answer to which one it may be would be very much appreciated.</li>
      <li>The flavor takes some getting used to, but I have found that it really grows on you after time.    </li>
      <li>I prefer a super high dose like this rather than take multiple doses per day of something.</li>
      <li>Though not the best tasting shot of energy, it isn&#x27;t horrible, goes down quickly, and is easy to pack around (just be sure to have a little straw with you).  </li>
      <li>I have already used this product completely and didn&#x27;t really see any real improvement in my overall well being.</li>
      <li>i have order wre full from other vendors</li>
      <li>Hard to say for sure but</li>
      <li>wow, this is a big step up from the 6,000 mg ones, which didn&#x27;t do much of anything.</li>
      <li>Old school energy boost.  </li>
      <li>Product arrived a day early.</li>
      <li>They have since changed how they package it, vials standing up not lying down inside the box in three trays layered on top of each other.    </li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know whether it was good or bad, either way</li>
      <li>Definitely provides a mental energy boost that is distinct from caffeine.  </li>
      <li>i love this product, however, to get past the bitter taste i make a tea w/ @</li>
      <li>Upon arrival there were many broken bottles.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve actually been buying this now from both local shops and once directly from a Royal King distributor located in CA.</li>
      <li>I have pretty severe ADD and have trouble focusing all the time.</li>
      <li>Drinking it with the included straw makes it go down without much contact with the tongue anyways.  </li>
      <li>But, with one taste of this product, I knew I couldn&#x27;t choke a whole vial down, so I ended up throwing it away.  </li>

<li> Revived loose and broken bottles without original packaging box</li>
<li> That one time some of the vials had broken during shipment,not worth a return IMO.</li>
<li> However, I have used other Royal King ginsengs of different strengths and, while bitter, they were palatable.  </li>
<li> Plus anything you did mix this into is going to taste like raw Chinese sewage.  </li>
<li> I did not experience a sugary aftertaste like some other brands.</li>
<li> Do not plan to mix this in tea or other liquids.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t work as well  in terms of energy in comparison to other lower mg brands</li>
<li> This company delivered this product on time, and it was in an unbroken condition when it arrived, something some other companies can&#x27;t seem to manage.  </li>
<li> The bottles are too hard to open without using the included puncture tools and straws.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve heard that some imbibers will add it to their tea or such, but I found it too hard to remove the cap.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t gag it down.  </li>
<li> can be made hot or cold.</li>
<li> pep with a little straw.  </li>
<li> i like the little straws</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> I am not sure whats helping me between this item and the hemp seed oil.</li>
<li> Just not sure yet.</li>
<li> It has never made me shaky or jittery . . .  </li>
<li> Another vendor had it, but 4 of the vials were broken when I opened the box.  </li>
<li> Had a bad reaction from it skin rash all over had to stop taking it other then</li>
<li> Yes it taste nasty as hell</li>
<li> the taste of the 8000&#x27;s is awful, but it definately gives you energy.  </li>
<li> Very nasty tasting.  </li>
<li> The benefits of the product way outweigh the nasty taste.</li>
<li> 14% seems like an awful lot!</li>

    <li> Revived loose and broken bottles without original packaging box</li>
    <li> A fine herbal extract. Natural energy,a healthy way for that get up and go. Great taste. There are many different Mg. strengths, try them all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually been buying this now from both local shops and once directly from a Royal King distributor located in CA. That one time some of the vials had broken during shipment,not worth a return IMO. They have since changed how they package it, vials standing up not lying down inside the box in three trays layered on top of each other.    I like the taste of this one over others I&#x27;ve used and seems to have better quality control as well.    Bottom line is there were no broken vials and I can now use this Amazon.com resource when I cannot find it locally.</li>
    <li> I feel a lot younger now that I&#x27;m using this product. It gives me more energy at 44 years old.</li>
    <li> wow, this is a big step up from the 6,000 mg ones, which didn&#x27;t do much of anything. the taste of the 8000&#x27;s is awful, but it definately gives you energy.  i see this isn&#x27;t nearly as popular as the 6,000&#x27;s because it doesn&#x27;t have the 6 box great deal, but in my opinion, you should go with these anyway.  i feel like these are what ginseng is all about.</li>
    <li> I got this product because i read on a forum that it helps when your quitting coffee. Personally i didn&#x27;t feel ANY thing when i drank this but when my mom drank it she mentioned that it would calm her nerves and she would sleep easier.</li>
    <li> Very happy with how quickly I received this! I am wondering about the alcohol content in it though. 14% seems like an awful lot! That&#x27;s like taking a shot of liquor before going to work. Any input on this?</li>
    <li> This company delivered this product on time, and it was in an unbroken condition when it arrived, something some other companies can&#x27;t seem to manage.  But, with one taste of this product, I knew I couldn&#x27;t choke a whole vial down, so I ended up throwing it away.  I&#x27;m still looking for a reliable vendor for the 4500 mg strength ginseng, which tastes quite palatable.  Asiachi.com was the vendor I used to use, but they don&#x27;t have it anymore.  Another vendor had it, but 4 of the vials were broken when I opened the box.  I&#x27;m sure this would be a terrific product, if one can drink it; I&#x27;ve had great improvement in my energy levels with the 4500 mg, so I wish I could have handled this strength.</li>
    <li> Yes, this stuff taste horrible. But, you get used to it. The benefits of the product way outweigh the nasty taste. I feel strongly that I had much better mental clarity and memory during my work season (seasonal tax preparation) than I have had in years. I prefer a super high dose like this rather than take multiple doses per day of something. I buy this product repeatedly. LOVE IT THAT MUCH!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so impressed that I can get 8 grams of Ginseng in each dose for so little money. I do notice a difference in how I feel and I&#x27;m grateful this company makes this product available.</li>
    <li> This always ships super fast and delivers great energy for workouts!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product regularly and drink a vial before exercising.  I find that it helps me to endure longer and so have a more effective workout.  The flavor takes some getting used to, but I have found that it really grows on you after time.    I have taken Ginseng for years and have had no ill side effects (though never take 2 vials as it can upset your stomach, but at this strength, one vial is plenty!)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t dispute the quality of the ginseng.  However, I have used other Royal King ginsengs of different strengths and, while bitter, they were palatable.  This one is like 13% alcohol and tastes so gross I can&#x27;t gag it down.  Try a different Royal King ginseng, avoid this one.</li>
    <li> Product arrived a day early. Great deal</li>
    <li> Love it ... Gives me the boost to get through the day. I will be ordering more in the future</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how effective this product is for me. I have pretty severe ADD and have trouble focusing all the time. I used to take a medicine for the ADD but since I started taking this product I have not needed it. I find myself very focused and full of energy. Another benefit for me has been more sexual energy and harder erections. This is an amazing benefit because I have been having trouble keeping an erection. Although it is not the fix all it has helped me substantially.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Definitely provides a mental energy boost that is distinct from caffeine.  If you&#x27;re already a coffee addict, this could help when you need that extra boost.</li>
    <li> love this stuff wouldn&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> Old school energy boost.  Ginseng is an adaptogen and has been proven to help performance in sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI do not mix ginseng products with vitamin C.  They work against one another.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great I love this brand but I&#x27;m questioning the alcohol percentage or matter a fact is it mandatory to include the alcohol?</li>
    <li> good stuff.  pep with a little straw.  i like the little straws</li>
    <li> These high quality ginseng vials offer a nice non-jittery energy boost. As the owner of a natural foods and herb business for many years, I saw the popularity of these vials grow and grow.</li>
    <li> Just ordered my second box and will continue to stay stocked.  I&#x27;m not drinking it for the taste - give me a break.  Drinking it with the included straw makes it go down without much contact with the tongue anyways.  It works and it works well.  I take it before I run and workout and the difference in stamina and reps is noticeable.  I do notice an elevation in my mood and sociability as well if I take it before work, but I mostly use it pre workout now.  There is a lot of variation between products, as with any supplement, but this one seems to be quality to me.</li>
    <li> Ok. I am not sure whats helping me between this item and the hemp seed oil. I started taking them around the same time.  I have noticed more definition in my arm muscles and I am losing weight! I don&#x27;t exercise at home, but I do move a lot at work. Was not losing anything until I started taking these. idk yet. I am on ny last bottle tho. Thats why I gave it 3 stars. Just not sure yet. Any answer to which one it may be would be very much appreciated. Can&#x27;t afford both..lol</li>
    <li> All bottles arrived intact.  Product is exactly as advertised.  Remember you&#x27;re buying this for the possible health effects, not the taste of the product.  Do not plan to mix this in tea or other liquids.  The bottles are too hard to open without using the included puncture tools and straws.  Plus anything you did mix this into is going to taste like raw Chinese sewage.  Better to drink straight and fast, chase with something tastier.</li>
    <li> Came a day earlier than promised and it is a good product, it is ginseng after all. Would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> glad you had this stock help me out with energy when i needed it thanks again for having this in stock</li>
    <li> Good to help your health.</li>
    <li> Upon arrival there were many broken bottles.  It was not packaged with fragile labels to protect glass inside the boxes.  I lost close to 1/4  of the shipment.  Didn&#x27;t work as well  in terms of energy in comparison to other lower mg brands</li>
    <li> Had a bad reaction from it skin rash all over had to stop taking it other then that it&#x27;s ok very good for energy.</li>
    <li> If you think it works it does.......</li>
    <li> This product is the real deal! It&#x27;s a great energy booster and easy to consume; even with the alcohol. I did not experience a sugary aftertaste like some other brands.</li>
    <li> I have already used this product completely and didn&#x27;t really see any real improvement in my overall well being. Because it had alcohol in it I really don&#x27;t know whether it was good or bad, either way I would probably buy it again to see the results. Most GINSENG products are not pure and this makes them not so effective.</li>
    <li> Hard to say for sure but over a week i think i have more energy and better mood.</li>
    <li> the vials were 2/3 full ~ others ginseng extract i have order wre full from other vendors were full ~</li>
    <li> Very nasty tasting.  Won&#x27;t. Buy it again. Waste of money</li>
    <li> Yes it taste nasty as hell but the benefit out weighs the taste I use it before my workout and later in the day.</li>
    <li> Though not the best tasting shot of energy, it isn&#x27;t horrible, goes down quickly, and is easy to pack around (just be sure to have a little straw with you).  I&#x27;ve heard that some imbibers will add it to their tea or such, but I found it too hard to remove the cap.  Easier just to poke a hole in the top (the straw won&#x27;t do this), insert straw, &amp; suck it up in 2 seconds.  It has never made me shaky or jittery . . .  just alert.  Have never taken more than one at a time nor had any caffeine with it.  Came very well packaged.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Love the stuff, it gives me the energy I need when I need it.</li>
    <li> love it would buy again</li>
    <li> i love this product, however, to get past the bitter taste i make a tea w/ @ 8oz tea/water, honey to taste w a dash of cinnamon and ginger. with this mixture i get a end product that taste good as well as the health benifits of tea, ginsing, cinnamon and ginger. can be made hot or cold.</li>
    <li> This is good for health, I have used this product off and on for years and since it comes at such a great price + free shipping for items over $25. its a win win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J Burns-El</li>
