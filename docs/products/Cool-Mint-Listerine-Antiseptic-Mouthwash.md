      <li>Good hygeines go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Cool mint has just the right amount of &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to it</li>

      <li>(Someone actually told me this funny enough, or not.</li>
      <li>Using it everyday has kept my teeth as clean as the day I left the dentist.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s minty mouthwash, what else can I say?</li>
    <li> Taste is yucky! Do not know yet if will treat sore throat as well as previous Listerine did.</li>
    <li> Love Listerine.  Using it everyday has kept my teeth as clean as the day I left the dentist.  Cool mint has just the right amount of &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; to it</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s there to say about Listering? It&#x27;s been around since before bad breath! ;-)</li>
    <li> BAM! Sharp, refreshing and a hit to the taste buds like you always remembered! It&#x27;s Listerine and nothing less, so for a good affordable bulk order, this is where to turn (1.5 Liters / 51oz. per bottle --- 3 Liters/102oz. total).</li>
    <li> We love it!! Super family size (which is not easy to find it from the local CVS), very good value pack!</li>
    <li> Best Listerine ever.  Do not buy the Zero one.  I made that mistake recently.</li>
    <li> I suffer from a dry mouth, so this product seems extremely strong, but it does clean the palate</li>
    <li> Great to send to college students who live far from a large grocery store.  Helps keep their teeth healthy and their breath fresh.  No excuses and price is good.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> I love the convenience of having mouthwash delivered home.  I would buy this at Costco, but I believe this price is pretty reasonable.  I think the price actually went down a little on my next purchase of this.  Listerine is definitely a must-have!</li>
    <li> Have been using Listerine for years and like it very much.</li>
    <li> Good price for the amount you get. Note that the bottle is quite large, so you should have some good place to put it or another smaller bottle/container to pour the contents to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cleaning, I do feel that satisfactory burning sensation and cool throat after thoroughly swooshing it in my mouth.</li>
    <li> Does the job. More comfortable to the mouth.</li>
    <li> Listerine has been around for a while.  I wouldn&#x27;t change now.  It works!</li>
    <li> I keep this in my house so my breath doesn&#x27;t stick like butt in the morning. Brushing also but this usually gives me the confidence that sometimes brushing may have missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep this in your house at all times. Good hygeines go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Also as a single bachelor, do yourself a favor and keep this out in your bathroom in the open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ladies will appreciate it and most likely take a swig if you might get lucky. Also good for afterwards too. Don&#x27;t have this in plain sight and you may miss your chance at an opportunity you never even knew was coming. (Someone actually told me this funny enough, or not. I only like to amuse myself).</li>
    <li> Works real good. Love it.</li>
    <li> The product arrived  safely and in a timely manner!</li>
    <li> I have one of this at home and at work. Its safe to have fresh breath all day!</li>
    <li> As ordered and above expectations.</li>
