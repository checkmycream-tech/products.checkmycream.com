      <li>Custom fit to your teeth with mold.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>My order went smoothly with no problems.  </li>
      <li>they claim it was  warrantied  when instead they just corrected the improper fit</li>
      <li>however the fit was a bit off.</li>
      <li>These fit tighter than teeth whitening trays.  </li>
      <li>Fit:</li>
      <li>express in light of this, but they did not reply, let alone do this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Overall, a great guard for the price.</li>
      <li>I followed the instructions in the box, made the mold, shipped it off and in a few weeks my mouthguard came in and was perfect.</li>
      <li>It fits great and so far it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
      <li>The guard fits good in my mouth except at the back.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t fit right.</li>
      <li>mine didn&#x27;t fit right instead of just fixing the problem  </li>
      <li>I contacted the email that was provided for me when I had problems molding my impression, and had a quick response.</li>
      <li>Both times the responses were quick and polite.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Their product information says that the complete night guard will arrive in two weeks; however, mine took more than three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My dentist insisted I get a night guard and $7000 worth of gum graphs.</li>
      <li>So I know I&#x27;ve made the right decision.</li>
      <li>/&gt;FWIW, the other vendor&#x27;s guard is from  Sparkling Smiles; it is a soft one and the final product fit is excellent.  </li>
      <li>I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be anywhere close to as good as the one I had previously from the dentist.</li>
      <li>Those claiming this is a long-lasting guard must be very light grinders or received something totally different than me.</li>
      <li>I will paste below my exact problem so that people get the idea</li>
      <li>I have used tons over the course of my life and this is my first custom.</li>
      <li>night guard is comfortable and appears to be of professional quality.</li>
      <li>is exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>This is my first guard ever.</li>
      <li>My first guard was the boil and bite variety.</li>
      <li>i wore an over the counter night guard that i purchased for $20, that i had to mold myself in hot water.</li>
      <li>I have no basis for comparison as it is my first night guard.</li>
      <li>The people there were very helpful when I did not make the impression correctly the first time.  </li>
      <li>Also, this mouthguard offers full coverage from the front teeth to molars.</li>
      <li>I first bought this in July 2011 as a replacement for the Custom Dual Laminate Teeth Night Grinding Guard  offered buy this company,  comparing the two, the dual laminate is thinner and more comfortable to wear, but my problem is I was breaking the guard where the back teeth come together, my dentist thinks its due to un-similar materials,  so I contacted sporting smiles</li>
      <li>The only issue I have is that it didn&#x27;t fit very well in the front.  </li>
      <li>Way too much money.</li>
      <li>Slim, very slim.</li>
      <li>Cost: MUCH cheaper than dentist.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is very ture...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have anything to comapre this guard to as it is the 1st guard I have ever had</li>
      <li>and I sleep very well with it in.</li>
      <li>My night guard really works, and I do not notice it when I am sleeping.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product over a month ago, and was really hoping I would get the nighguard and start wearing it nightly before Christmas.</li>
      <li>The process was very east.</li>
      <li>Started to chew through very soon.</li>
      <li>respond fast to any email questions.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
      <li>right side more intense then the left, but left still has it.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it will hold up in the long run, but so far I am pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>Way more durable than any other guard I tried!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend using this company.</li>
      <li>more then a few scrapes from the front teeth,  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It will make a nice super expensive mouth guard, however.</li>
      <li>since I did my casting they still had it on file,  paid for the new one and they made and shipped it to me,  </li>
      <li>They even keep your impressions for a year in case you need a new one.</li>
      <li>Shipping time: I live in Canada, so if your&#x27;e in the US</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the high quality</li>
      <li>First of all it took 3 1/2 weeks to get the finished product back.</li>
      <li>There is also similar pressure but not so much intense on my left side (your right).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great and the fit is great. At first, I was intimidated about the process and had little faith in what would be sent back to me. However, the product I received was exactly what I needed and surpassed what I expected.</li>
    <li> It took three weeks to get the night guard after sending back the impression. I have had it for about two weeks now. I had it made for my lower teeth. The guard fits good in my mouth except at the back. It extends a little too far back over my back teeth and when I bite down it hurts my gums. Maybe its something I need to get used to. Overall I think it is going to work to keep my front teeth from hitting at night when and if I grind my teeth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this at the end of December and it arrived within the week--very quick shipping. I made the impressions and sent them back the next day. Their product information says that the complete night guard will arrive in two weeks; however, mine took more than three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted the seller once with a question and once to inquire about the status of my completed guard, after more than two weeks had passed. At that time they sent me the tracking information. Both times the responses were quick and polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night guard is comfortable and appears to be of professional quality. I don&#x27;t know whether it will hold up in the long run, but so far I am pleased with the product. My only real issue is the fact that they advertise two weeks but it took a lot longer than that. IT would have been helpful if they&#x27;d sent tracking information when the completed night guard was shipped rather than waiting for me to wonder what was going on and then contact them.</li>
    <li> I first bought this in July 2011 as a replacement for the Custom Dual Laminate Teeth Night Grinding Guard  offered buy this company,  comparing the two, the dual laminate is thinner and more comfortable to wear, but my problem is I was breaking the guard where the back teeth come together, my dentist thinks its due to un-similar materials,  so I contacted sporting smiles and they recomended this gaurd, and since it was just 4months since I did my casting they still had it on file,  paid for the new one and they made and shipped it to me,  it is a lot thicker then the dual laminate, and it is somewhat squishy when biting into it, but still fits like a glove  I showed it to my dentist and he couldn&#x27;t believe you could get that quality of a mouth gaurd online, and at that price too, (his office charges 650$ for similar)  his only recomendation was to have the bite checked by your dentist when you went for your appt. other then that he was amazed, and the dental hygenist actually took the info from me on where I got it  and like I said I have been using it now for over 6months with nothing more then a few scrapes from the front teeth,  I will definatly buy another if/when the time comes, but being that after 6months it is showing no signs of giving up, it might be awhile</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I get a mouth guard since it appeared I was grinding my teeth. He wanted $600 and I knew there had to be a less expensive option.  I researched many mouth guards and this one got good reviews.  I have been using it for 4 1/2 months and am very satisfied. I give it 4 stars not 5 because the workmanship of the mouth guard is not entirely smooth. It is rough is a few places and the soft silicon cannot be smooth out.  I will buy another one to have a spare if my dentist says that it has helped my teeth.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for about half a week. It is very comfortable. It does not retain any odor. It seems like it will be just what I was looking for, at an affordable price. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing. The material is firm but not too hard. I have no basis for comparison as it is my first night guard. I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This was cheaper than what my dentist could offer saving me at least $210. It was way more durable than any mouthguard from a store. After about a year of use, it started getting a little hole by one of my canine teeth . Way more durable than any other guard I tried! Also, this mouthguard offers full coverage from the front teeth to molars. Lastly, I love that it is one piece because it makes it more durable and will not fall apart like 2-layer mouthguards. I will be buying this exact one again and again and will recommend it to anyone with super bad nighttime grinding and/or clenching.</li>
    <li> so far I haven&#x27;t had any issue with this product and it seams to be working great. Make the mold was easier then i thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Waste of money for heavy grinder  did not last long save your money get one from your dentist.also disappointed with there warranty  mine didn&#x27;t fit right instead of just fixing the problem  they warranty it so when I wanted them to warranty it they claim it was  warrantied  when instead they just corrected the improper fit</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cost: MUCH cheaper than dentist.&lt;br /&gt;- Fit: Custom fit to your teeth with mold.&lt;br /&gt;- Size: Slim, very slim. Very comfortable to wear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping time: I live in Canada, so if your&#x27;e in the US it&#x27;ll be faster, but I ordered my product 7 weeks ago and it just arrived today. There was a delay making my night guard because they were short staffed. I asked them to ship it express in light of this, but they did not reply, let alone do this.&lt;br /&gt;- Durability: It seems strong, but it will be hard to tell. I&#x27;m a fairly heavy grinder/clencher so we&#x27;ll have to see if it stands the test of time. On initial feel, I have my doubts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would i order again? Probably. But I&#x27;m on the fence.</li>
    <li> I have a severe grinding problem with my teeth. I have paid $1000 for a mouth guard from a dentist which lasted only 9 months. I have only had this mouth guard for a month but so far if is showing no sign of wear. I would definitely recommend this guard for severe grinders.</li>
    <li> This is a nice gaurd however the fit was a bit off. Didn&#x27;t have the time to return or get them fixed.</li>
    <li> The whole process and product is as expected. This is my first guard ever. They actually keep your mold for six months not a year. Great price. I thought it would be a soft silicone material but it&#x27;s not. Very comfortable. I&#x27;ve had this for 8 months now and don&#x27;t anticipate replacing it for another year or two. I would highly recommend using this company.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really have anything to comapre this guard to as it is the 1st guard I have ever had but I wear it nightly and I sleep very well with it in. It fits great and so far it&#x27;s holding up very well. Very happy I didn&#x27;t spend $350 at my dentist office for the same thing....</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mouthguard. I have used tons over the course of my life and this is my first custom. There&#x27;s no going back from here. This one is the only one that has ever stayed in my mouth the whole night. It fits like a glove and isn&#x27;t bulky! I will always wear this type mouth guard. It was easy to do. I followed the instructions in the box, made the mold, shipped it off and in a few weeks my mouthguard came in and was perfect. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on guards over the years I could have purchased 5 of these. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this. If you need a professional nightguard that stays in all night and isn&#x27;t bulky this is it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this night guard nightly for almost 2 years, and it&#x27;s still in good shape. I grind/clench pretty hard too; the reason I got this night guard is because a couple years ago the dentist told me that my teeth were worn to the point that I&#x27;d lose them if I didn&#x27;t get one. So it&#x27;s held up to some abuse. Not bad for less than $100.</li>
    <li> Three way shipping works flawlessly even to Canada.&lt;br /&gt;Product comes with clear (written + vidéo) instructions on how to do the imprint.&lt;br /&gt;They respond fast to any email questions.&lt;br /&gt;Product is exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost at 2 years with this night guard and it is showing no signs of stopping soon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had numerous other kinds, at no small cost, from my dentists over the years, all of which I ground right through.  This one has not one sign of breakage - it&#x27;s flexible and comfortable and has done much to slow bone loss in my jaw.  My only complaint was that it took quite a while to receive my unit after I sent in my mold, and the company didn&#x27;t offer much in the way of communication.  Of course, this was nearly 2 years ago, so maybe they have upgraded their systems.&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said that it costs them more than this to send out for a bite guard, so this really is a great deal.</li>
    <li> This is not &amp;#34;super hard&amp;#34; at all! I was using hard acrylic guard and this is very soft in comparison, and just a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;It will make a nice super expensive mouth guard, however.</li>
    <li> First of all it took 3 1/2 weeks to get the finished product back. It was over the hoildays, so no sweat.  However, I am not happy with the finished product.  I don&#x27;t like the coverage and I don&#x27;t like the fit.  I should have paid the dentist $300 to get a professional one.  I&#x27;m stuck with a product I am not happy with and I am out the $90 I paid for it.  It is very ture...you get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> Due to grinding my teeth at night, my gums were taking a toll. My dentist insisted I get a night guard and $7000 worth of gum graphs. Well, the night guard was really expensive too so I thought I would look around. I am glad I did, my night guard fits perfectly and I know it is working because I have not chewed through it yet and I&#x27;ve had it almost 6 months. My oral surgeon made a low cost one ($150) while my gums were recovering and I chewed through that one in less than a week. So I know I&#x27;ve made the right decision.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t fit right. Started to chew through very soon. Way too much money.</li>
    <li> I ordered direct from Sporting Smiles. As soon as I saw the guard I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be anywhere close to as good as the one I had previously from the dentist. It weighed maybe half as much and flimsy is the first word that came to mind despite me having ordered the thickest guard they make. The first guard lasted about 9 months, which is longer than I expected by the looks of it actually. Holes start to form in the back and once one starts the guard needs to be tossed or you&#x27;ll be eating pieces of it in your sleep because it rapidly deteriorates after that. In a pinch and just needing a guard asap I ordered another and the second guard did&#x27;t even make it 6 months. Those claiming this is a long-lasting guard must be very light grinders or received something totally different than me.</li>
    <li> These fit tighter than teeth whitening trays.  As I understand it, they need to.  My order went smoothly with no problems.  The only glitch was that I sent out an email to the vendor asking whether to use the mould on my upper teeth or lower.  I didn&#x27;t get a response for a week so I just did the upper teeth.  An answer and appology email was sent out a few days after I had already sent the used mold back to them.  The fit is very snug and I am unable to completely close my jaw when wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist said not to wear this because it is made poorly in that my jaw is not able to close completely because of the design and it is likely to cause problems with tooth alignment and jaw pain.</li>
    <li> Saved me a ton of $ from having to get this custom made at the dentist.The construction is similar in quality to a previous one that I had received from a professional dentist in the past. Good instructions in the kit.</li>
    <li> This night guard fits better than any night guard I have had made by my dentist.  I spent a ton of money on three other night guards. People have complained about turn around time and just so they know you have to wait 2-3 weeks even when you go to a dentist and this costs a fraction of the price. So basically, quit whining. You are getting deal and an awesome night guard.</li>
    <li> This product is great if you have an issue with night clenching or night grinding like I do. It doesn’t sit on the gum line so it doesn’t push down the gum. I was running into issues with other night guards pushing down the gum leading to me having to have gum surgery. So if you are in need of mouth guard I highly recommend it. Every time I have called they are very courteous and help in any question I have.</li>
    <li> The night guard arrived on time and has seemed fairly sturdy.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it for three or four months with no splitting or coming apart like others have mentioned.  The only issue I have is that it didn&#x27;t fit very well in the front.  It caused a little pain in the morning on one front tooth due to putting too much pressure on it overnight.  This lasted for a couple of months and either the guard or my tooth adjusted.  I should have called and had it replaced by it didn&#x27;t and it doesn&#x27;t bother me anymore.  Other than that, it seems fine.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit and works great. Same quality as my $500 one my dog had destroyed made by dentist. I will recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Great product.  Perfect fit.  Mold was easy to make and the turn around time was very good.  I was leary of purchasing this online as I had first considered some other companies, but the reviews for thes companies were awful.  I was worried this would be another of those companies, but I was pleasantly surprised and I&#x27;m glad I chose to do business with these guys.</li>
    <li> I ordered this guard and another guard from a another Amazon vendor both on 12/5/2012 and FINALLY just received this one on 1/14/2013.  I tried wearing this mouth guard for bed because I grind at night.  The fit is too tight across the front and squeezes them together. I contacted the company and They asked me to return the item and will back cut it?. I had emailed them multiple times through Amazon and never got a response, thats why I initated a telephone call to them.  This seller must be so busy with other sellers that my mouthguard is not important to them..  They never responded to my inital emails and obviously have yet to even send me a mouthguard I can wear!  They are slow to respond and in my case not at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, the other vendor&#x27;s guard is from  Sparkling Smiles; it is a soft one and the final product fit is excellent.  I also wanted this hard one to wear to sleep, (for more stressful times and occasional harder grinding)  and thats why I ordered 2 different guards but the bonus was that it was from  2 different sellers, which I am ultimately glad I did since I still don&#x27;t have a hard one to wear.</li>
    <li> Best fitting night guard - and I&#x27;ve had many.</li>
    <li> I have now ordered 2 night guards from them.  The people there were very helpful when I did not make the impression correctly the first time.  My night guard really works, and I do not notice it when I am sleeping.  And the price is excellent for the product.</li>
    <li> I grind and clench very hard at night to the point I knew I needed a night guard. After talking to my dentist (who wanted to charge me $700) I decided to shop online. My first guard was the boil and bite variety. It did the job, but it was very uncomfortable. I decided to get a custom guard online and bought this one. I was surprised by the high quality and it&#x27;s very comfortable. The first few weeks it&#x27;s a bit stiff until you break it in, but after that you barely have any problems sleeping with it. It&#x27;s large enough to keep your teeth separated while maintaining a lip seal. After 5 months it&#x27;s still holding up and that&#x27;s after some seriously heavy grinding and clenching on my part. Overall, a great guard for the price.</li>
    <li> 12/15/2012 - My teeth grind. But my biggest problem is that as a result of my teeth grinding, I cannot sleep on my stomach, my favorite position, any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product over a month ago, and was really hoping I would get the nighguard and start wearing it nightly before Christmas. The biggest complain I have is that once I actually got the final product, I had major problems. I contacted the email that was provided for me when I had problems molding my impression, and had a quick response. But when my night guard arrived and I started having problems, I explained in detail what was causing my nightguard to mess with my teeth.  And I haven&#x27;t heard from these guys for over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $90, I could&#x27;ve bought 3 night guards of different brands over the counter and I know at least one of them would&#x27;ve done the job. I will paste below my exact problem so that people get the idea what may happen to their final night guard. I am open to revising this review, but only after get a replacement. My biggest complain is the amount of time it took for me to get the mixing materials, mix, send it out, get the night guard, only to realize it hurts my teeth. 5 stars on responsiveness, but 1 star on the product quality and the amount of time it took for me to realize how badly my nightguard turned out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;when I put it on there is a lot of pressure at the front of the teeth. my front right, if you are standing outside of me looking at me it would be your left. It is 1 tooth before the canine that moves toward the center. and in that spot i feel a lot of pressure pushing into my mouth. There is also similar pressure but not so much intense on my left side (your right). There is also pressure in my back right teeth that go all the way in the back. the night guard is pushing in, like it is too small. i feel similar on my left back teeth being pushed in (from the outside), but again, not as intense as my right side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i only wore this night guard once and will never do so again because i woke up with my teeth sore like i was wearing braces all night. i wore an over the counter night guard that i purchased for $20, that i had to mold myself in hot water. and the difference was that it was much bigger, and took time getting used to. but it was never uncomfotable or put pressure on my teeth like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. there is also pressure that i feel on the inside of my back teeth. right side more intense then the left, but left still has it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Best mouth guard I have ever purchased! It was built so well! I&#x27;ve bought soo many mouth guard.The process was very east. They sent me a do it yourself kit with easy to follow instructions to make impressions.after you send it back it takes about 2 weeks and the final product is so well made! They even keep your impressions for a year in case you need a new one.</li>
    <li> These last for years, and are thinner than the hard ones I&#x27;ve purchase (six times the price) from my dentist, so they don&#x27;t put my jaw out of alignment.</li>
