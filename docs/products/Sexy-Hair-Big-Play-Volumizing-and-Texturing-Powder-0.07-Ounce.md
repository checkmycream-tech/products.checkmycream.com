      <li>As with other reviews, be sure to apply to roots and POW!!!</li>
      <li>Works as stated, adds some volume/density to fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This powder works miracles on my fine, wavy hair.</li>
      <li>If you have fine skimpy hair or you need volume then this stuff is fabulous.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found that gives volume at the crown with little effort.</li>
      <li>This is purse size and a great Price, as the larger size isn&#x27;t Cheap, and this fits in your Purse, and you&#x27;ll never want to be without it.</li>
      <li>What was really great was that I ordered 3 because they&#x27;re only a cent, and when I got them in the mail, they gave me 3 free ones as well.</li>
      <li>I was really happy to see this on Amazon because I cant seem to find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
      <li>this powder sprinkled on your roots gives my hair the volume it needs to look fantastic in a jiffy.</li>
      <li>The .07 oz size was given to me by my hairdresser as a free sample.</li>
      <li>maybe 3/5ths filled.</li>
      <li>The bottle wasnt filled up all the way..</li>
      <li>Its super fine like rice powder.</li>
      <li>I need to purchase a truck full in case they ever decide to discontinue -</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight, silky, oily hair and no styling product has ever managed to give it volume or texture.  </li>
      <li>Be aware that this is NOT the full size bottle.</li>
      <li>it was not the right shade.</li>
      <li>First time ever.  </li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, but it seems to work pretty well.</li>
      <li>Tilt and tap tap it on, because if you pour it you&#x27;ll get WAY to much!</li>
      <li>First time I used it I shook it, and got WAY WAY too much!</li>
      <li>didint do anything to my hair and for the price of this one I could have gotten a different powder from another place that I know works for sure.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend Big Sexy Products.</li>
      <li>Prefer dry shampoo for volumn and texture so much better.</li>
      <li>and i got it fast</li>
      <li>This stuff really works to put some style in your hair.  </li>
      <li>And it can sort of be reactivated by rubbing your scalp/roots and gently fluffing your hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tossed most of my other styling products and just use this and a spritz of finishing spray now.  </li>
      <li>I thought, wow that&#x27;s easy enough that I could do that.  </li>
      <li>Most styling products just hasten the lank, greasy stage and weigh it down.  </li>
      <li>My hair is short and very straight, but when I discovered powder play, it was the first product that gave my hair some volume and body.  </li>
      <li>In a cute, reeeeeally little bottle.</li>
      <li>as opposed to .53 for the normal size).</li>
      <li>I love the product but the bottle is small</li>
      <li>I usually love this product and wanted a small bottle of it I could carry around with me in my purse.</li>
      <li>I like to use this with the other Big Sexy hair products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down</li>
      <li>Seeing that it was available for a dollar less than I paid the day I received</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would have liked without having to fluff it through the day.</li>
      <li>They can&#x27;t make it fast enough for us!</li>
      <li>I also color it frequently.</li>
      <li>The hair has to be clean and dry to use it, but it simply lasts and lasts and makes my hair manageable and stylable, and the styles actually stay!  </li>
      <li>and I felt it actually weighed down my fine long hair.</li>
      <li>That is a bit of a drawback, as is the fact that the white powder can show in the roots if it isn&#x27;t worked in completely.</li>
      <li>SPOOF, BAM, WOW!!!  </li>
      <li>My roommates and I all went in on a shipment of these products together, and we were pleasantly surprised by the extra powders that came in our package at no extra cost.</li>
      <li>I have short extremely thin straight hair and this product perked it right up.</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t work on next day, or greasy, or dirty hair even though it takes oil out of the hair to give the volume, that hair must be freshly washed and dry, and it is to shake on the scalp, although if you put a little on fingers you&#x27;ll be able to reach up under your hair and rub it on your scalp around neckline!</li>

<li> Saw so many stars but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair any real volume :(</li>
<li> Has your hair gone flat?</li>
<li> I&#x27;m hoping it will last a long time between having to purchase another one.</li>
<li> I did work as long as I continued to do that.</li>
<li> It lasts long also.</li>
<li> Does not really volume for short hair.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems with residue that the other reviewers mention, but maybe that&#x27;s because I have to wash almost daily anyway.  </li>
<li> Weird but cool</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t see it or feel it on your hair and be careful when you put it in the hair.</li>
<li> It just simply does not feel like it gives very much volume, just feels dirty.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way to adding volume, style.</li>
<li> Tried other cheaper brands</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered it that it was such a small bottle.</li>
<li> You definitely know it is there because the areas where you use it will feel different and difficult to move your fingers through or to comb.  </li>
<li> At the beginning of the day it&#x27;s so silky and flyaway that can slip out of any scrunchie made and a half a can of hairspray is needed to keep it in place, then by the end of the day it&#x27;s lank, greasy, limp and falling in my face.  </li>
<li> Just need a little to get the lift you want</li>
<li> Just wasted I threw it away</li>
<li> i got this small one because of an ipsy bag promotion and wanted to give it a try.  </li>
<li> Gave it lift and volume with just my fingers and no curling iron which I usually am attached too.</li>
<li> My bad for not double checking the ounces (.07</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff really works to put some style in your hair.  Sprinkle it at the root, where lift is needed, and work it in.  Throughout the day, you can revive it by pushing your fingers into it.  You definitely know it is there because the areas where you use it will feel different and difficult to move your fingers through or to comb.  That is a bit of a drawback, as is the fact that the white powder can show in the roots if it isn&#x27;t worked in completely.</li>
    <li> IT DOES WHAT IT SAYS IT IS GOING TO DO, IT MAKES YOUR HAIR LOOK FULLER.  THE ONLY PROBLEM I FOUND WAS THE RESIDUE IT LEFT ON YOUR HAIR.  IF YOU WASH YOUR HAIR DAILY THIS WOULDN&#x27;T BE A PROBLEM.</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair and this product is awesome for giving it body and lift! And it can sort of be reactivated by rubbing your scalp/roots and gently fluffing your hair. I was really happy to see this on Amazon because I cant seem to find it in my local stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Weird but cool, does the job. But you definitely need to wash hair daily. And use sparingly or it gets sticky.</li>
    <li> Works as stated, adds some volume/density to fine hair.  Good to use in conjunction with some spray after you rub it in.  Frankly Batiste is the way to go moreso</li>
    <li> I have short extremely thin straight hair and this product perked it right up. Gave it lift and volume with just my fingers and no curling iron which I usually am attached too. The .07 oz size was given to me by my hairdresser as a free sample.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would have liked without having to fluff it through the day. I did work as long as I continued to do that.</li>
    <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;Where have you been all my life?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like to use this with the other Big Sexy hair products. All the products help with giving my hair the extra volume I need.</li>
    <li> didint do anything to my hair and for the price of this one I could have gotten a different powder from another place that I know works for sure.</li>
    <li> I usually love this product and wanted a small bottle of it I could carry around with me in my purse. but when I opened the package the very small bottle was already opened! I recommend not buying from this seller</li>
    <li> A stylist in Myrtle Bch used this product on my hair.  I thought, wow that&#x27;s easy enough that I could do that.  I really liked the results, as I have very fine hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use an the  results were great for me.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered it that it was such a small bottle. So it turned out not to be a great deal after all. It works OK.</li>
    <li> Be aware that this is NOT the full size bottle. My bad for not double checking the ounces (.07 as opposed to .53 for the normal size). Good for travel, I guess, but you get six times the product if you double the price. Seeing that it was available for a dollar less than I paid the day I received it was just salt in the wound, but again, my bad. It&#x27;s a good product. In a cute, reeeeeally little bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have curly hair, which I straighten daily. I also color it frequently. Because of this, I get a lot of fly aways. This powder smooths them out without adding weight or a sticky feeling to my hair. I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of products in my hair because it changes the texture so this is perfect.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the texture of it and I felt it actually weighed down my fine long hair. Prefer dry shampoo for volumn and texture so much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only tried it once so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, but it seems to work pretty well. It does what it says it will do. What was really great was that I ordered 3 because they&#x27;re only a cent, and when I got them in the mail, they gave me 3 free ones as well. If I continue to like it, I&#x27;m set now for a while.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Product is ok. Does not really volume for short hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight, silky, oily hair and no styling product has ever managed to give it volume or texture.  At the beginning of the day it&#x27;s so silky and flyaway that can slip out of any scrunchie made and a half a can of hairspray is needed to keep it in place, then by the end of the day it&#x27;s lank, greasy, limp and falling in my face.  Most styling products just hasten the lank, greasy stage and weigh it down.  This stuff works!  The hair has to be clean and dry to use it, but it simply lasts and lasts and makes my hair manageable and stylable, and the styles actually stay!  I&#x27;ve tossed most of my other styling products and just use this and a spritz of finishing spray now.  It&#x27;s awesome stuff!    I haven&#x27;t had any of the problems with residue that the other reviewers mention, but maybe that&#x27;s because I have to wash almost daily anyway.  I can actually go longer with this because it absorbs some of the oil.</li>
    <li> Just as described and will purchase from again! :)</li>
    <li> My hair is short and very straight, but when I discovered powder play, it was the first product that gave my hair some volume and body.  I required a perm every 6 months for body not curl, and I no longer have to do that.  First time ever.  Love love this product.  I need to purchase a truck full in case they ever decide to discontinue - Oh, I hope that never happens</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way to adding volume, style.</li>
    <li> This is what my hair stylist uses.  It&#x27;s light, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down which is good since I have really fine hair.  Gives lots of volume!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair feel greasy!</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff. Just need a little to get the lift you want</li>
    <li> This powder works miracles on my fine, wavy hair. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found that gives volume at the crown with little effort. My roommates and I all went in on a shipment of these products together, and we were pleasantly surprised by the extra powders that came in our package at no extra cost.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Saw so many stars but it doesn&#x27;t give my hair any real volume :(</li>
    <li> The bottle wasnt filled up all the way..maybe 3/5ths filled.</li>
    <li> I do not need to tease my hair when using this!</li>
    <li> I love the product but the bottle is small</li>
    <li> This is awesome for light product feel, controls oil!</li>
    <li> Perfect transaction, thank you!  GREAT product!</li>
    <li> i love this for volume and oily hair.  i got this small one because of an ipsy bag promotion and wanted to give it a try.  it works great.  also glad seller added free gifts inside :)</li>
    <li> Has your hair gone flat? Not enough time to style it? this powder sprinkled on your roots gives my hair the volume it needs to look fantastic in a jiffy. It lasts long also.</li>
    <li> The product works well, but it is pricey for the amount you get.  It&#x27;s a good travel-size container.  I&#x27;m hoping it will last a long time between having to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> If you have fine skimpy hair or you need volume then this stuff is fabulous. Its super fine like rice powder. You can&#x27;t see it or feel it on your hair and be careful when you put it in the hair. Tilt and tap tap it on, because if you pour it you&#x27;ll get WAY to much! A tiny amount is all you need. First time I used it I shook it, and got WAY WAY too much! Greatest stuff ever, and when you put your hands in your hair and shake that fullness stays til you shake it again. This is purse size and a great Price, as the larger size isn&#x27;t Cheap, and this fits in your Purse, and you&#x27;ll never want to be without it. I&#x27;ve used this product on many a client. They can&#x27;t make it fast enough for us! Tried other cheaper brands but This Is The One. You do get what you pay for! People might be a bit confused in some comments. It won&#x27;t work on next day, or greasy, or dirty hair even though it takes oil out of the hair to give the volume, that hair must be freshly washed and dry, and it is to shake on the scalp, although if you put a little on fingers you&#x27;ll be able to reach up under your hair and rub it on your scalp around neckline! Hope this helps</li>
    <li> SPOOF, BAM, WOW!!!  As with other reviews, be sure to apply to roots and POW!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it to save money, but it does not work as well as the Michael O&#x27;Rourke brand that I buy, so I would not buy this again. It just simply does not feel like it gives very much volume, just feels dirty.</li>
    <li> Great product to give volume to the hair! Highly recommend Big Sexy Products. This stuff is sprinkled on the root and it gives volume, it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
    <li> I love the product and i got it fast</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Great travel size.</li>
    <li> I did not get to use it it was not the right shade. Just wasted I threw it away</li>
</ol>
