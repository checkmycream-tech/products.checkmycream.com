<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of weeks now. It has a very pleasant scent during application (slightly fruity), the scent doesn&#x27;t &#x27;turn&#x27; like all other self-tanners I&#x27;ve used, and I think it does a good job of moisturizing. With that said, I have not noticed any difference in the shade of my very pale skin color. I plan to buy it again when I finish up this bottle, but without expectations of building any tan.</li>
    <li> I had almost given up on finding anything I could stand the smell of since Aveeno discontinued their sunless tanning product (and what is that all about anyway?) This gives a nice touch of color to my skin, it smells fantastic, it moisturizes, absorbs quickly, goes on evenly, and it does not turn me orange. I need something to hold me over into the beach days as I live in Florida and the shorts come out in March but the beach life doesn&#x27;t start for me until May.  The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is it does not live up to the results I received from Aveeno. Definately will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells like summer, I&#x27;m still waiting to compare it to my Jergans healthy glow. It really does smell fantastic and I am very picky with scents.</li>
    <li> Really like this including a slight amount of tan.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer, plus it gives just the right amount of color which I was hoping for.  The only con about the lotion for me is that the smell, while not unpleasant, is rather heavy.  The fragrance interferes with my perfume.  If the product was unscented, it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Price better than TJ Maxx!</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to have much tanning effect, but the smell is good and it is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Love the smell but seems watered down.</li>
    <li> This is the time of year to use this it is very creamy and delightful after a day in the sun.</li>
    <li> Smells like a tanning booth, but still nice lotion.</li>
    <li> Provides a mellow color. I use in between self tanner to maintain color. Smell is not bad but not great either. I only use at night and shower off in the morning.</li>
    <li> Good size.  Lasts a long time.  What&#x27;s amazing is no noticeable smell or streaking!!  Builds coverage faster than other body lotions I&#x27;ve used.  This is not a lotion to make you tan for your same day event, but great for everyday use.  Doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout or greasy, and dries relatively quickly.  You do need to wash your hands afterwards or you&#x27;ll develop a darker tint in between your fingers.  Highly recommend</li>
    <li> The people that love this stuff must have really, really pale skin.  I am a blonde Caucasian, but I do tan well in the sun, and this did nothing for me color-wise.  And I have extremely sensitive skin, after 4 uses I can see the start of a rash all over my torso.  It is very moisturizing though.  But as a tanner, it is totally worthless.</li>
    <li> Very moisterizing with just the right amount of color. Natural looking. Thick consistency.</li>
    <li> At first I thought it was going to work well but after about a week, it turned my skin a yellowish color.  It also came off on my towels after my shower.</li>
    <li> Great lotion but not self tanner. Was really hoping this product would work since it has better ingredients, I put it on my legs first and didn&#x27;t see any difference the next day, so I put it on my entire body for 3 days in a row and the only thing i saw was a weird thin tan ring around my arm, other than that no tan anywhere else. The lotion is wonderful though, it makes my skin really soft and smooth, the smell out of the bottle is that tropical coconut smell which Im not too fond of but once it is absorbed in the skin it just smells fruity, NO tanning smell at all!!! I have pale skin and I know it takes a while for tanning lotions/sprays to work on me, about 24 hours,  thats why I continued to use this product since it does say &amp;#34;hint of tan&amp;#34; but unfortunately I had no results. Could just be my skin since plenty of reviews here are positive.</li>
    <li> Great smell at first, but did have that &amp;#34;fake tan&amp;#34; smell after a while. Noticeable results after a couple applications, but I then had obvious tan lines on my wrist from trying to wash it off my hands after applying. Plus I still had orangish- yellow hands.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion. It smells really good and leaves my skin nice and soft. I use it in conjunction with another tanning product to help maintain a darker color without having to do the actual tanning lotion every day. The bottle is huge, I think it will last a long time. As for the tan itself, I am not sure alone what it will do since I am using it as a maintainer, but it works well with the \\&quot;tan overnight\\&quot; product that I also use. It smells nice enough, that I will use it in the morning and not worry about smelling like tanning product all day long.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> The coconut smell is too strong so I am not sure about the TOUCH OF TAN and if it works that way.</li>
    <li> Love the tropical scent which is subtle coconut mango smell. Moisturizing and a nice gradual tan.  And it does not give me that self tanner &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; that usually develops.</li>
    <li> I have been using it daily for a couple months now and have not noticed any difference as far as skin tone, but I didn&#x27;t expect much after reading the other reviews, but I like the smell and it is a decent moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and feels nice, but didn&#x27;t give me any color. I&#x27;m very pale, and almost always use a bronzer or a gradual tanner to get some color year round. This gave me nothing. Maybe like a super duper slight color if i look really close, but I can&#x27;t even tell for sure. I think i&#x27;m just hoping to see some color since i bought the product for that purpose. I wish it worked. I guess I&#x27;ll keep it as a regular lotion, but disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love this product is smells so amazing and wokrs awesome with my overnight weekly dark tanner (sun laboratories)&lt;br /&gt;It makes my tan glow and keeps it super even. Love it you should definitely buy BOTH  products if you want an amzingly dark brown natural tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0009V8N5E Sun Self Tanning Lotion Ultra Dark Instant Tint - Dark 8oz/236ml]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle....a repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I used this product for over a week with no tan results, not even a hint of a tan.  I have very fair skin so maybe this is why it didn&#x27;t work.  It was a thick creamy lotion and smelled nice, but was not much of a tanning product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair. Snow white looks tan compared to me. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a sunless tanner that a) didn&#x27;t streak like crazy, b) wasn&#x27;t impossible to apply, c) didn&#x27;t smell like death, and d) didn&#x27;t look super orange and fake. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used!!! Very very gradual color that allows you to control how dark you get. Super easy to apply...it&#x27;s just like regular lotion! It has a really mild tropical scent. I started on my legs for a tester and after three light applications over three days with a gentle exfoliation after day three, it looks perfect. I still look like me - fair - but not pasty or orange. It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve always dreamed of! Must try if you&#x27;re looking for something you could add to part of your daily routine easily and if you like a natural, not obvious tan.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product!!! Makes your skin super soft and gives a nice touch of color without the stank the other gradual tanners have lol! A little bit goes a long way I still have quite a bit left in the bottle!!! Will defiantly reorder when I need more!!! Buy this before u buy the stuff at your local store!!!</li>
    <li> So many compliments on the smell have not seen a difference in my skin yet but probably need to use more often.</li>
    <li> well I like it because of all the oils but as far as a touch of tan you have to apply it at least three times to see some color, I would rather see color the first time when applied.</li>
    <li> What an awesome product!  I now buy all the time. Love the hint of bronzer!!</li>
    <li> I am light skinned and would like to avoid the tanning bed as much as possible.  This product works really good...great moisturizer. ..color is just right...not blotchy. ..smells good and you only get the slightest hint of self tanner afterscent unlike many other products I&#x27;ve tried.  Only problem was that the pump doesn&#x27;t work :(  otherwise I would buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> after reading the reviews it sounded like this was a good product for self tanning. Well.....it&#x27;s not. I have streaks and orange spots. Especially between my fingers. I exfoliated first in the shower and then I would apply it. Really not happy with this product. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> Yes, I love this lotion! Use everyday in my legs.</li>
    <li> Nice lotion no real color enhancement.</li>
    <li> I love love LOVE this stuff!!!! I have very pasty skin and can&#x27;t tan easily at all! I spent six months a couple years ago tanning in a tanning bed five nights a week. Literally, 6 months. I was tan, but I was at the point where it was scaring me how much I was going, so I stopped. I came across this stuff and decided to give it a try. It arrived quickly which we all know is always a bonus. And remember when I said it took me six months in a tanning bed to get tan? Well applying this once a night before bed for THREE NIGHTS got me as dark if not DARKER than I was after those six months in a bed!!!! 100% fact!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this work fast and give great tan results, it had a pleasant smell to it. I also ordered the regular argon oil moisturizer to go along with it. So at night I apply the tanner before I go to bed. In the morning I shower and apply the regular moisturizer. Both have a pleasant almost coconut-like smell to them and dry skin?? Yep it takes care of that too! Together they are awesome and I will continue buying for sure!! As I&#x27;m leaving this review I&#x27;m ordering another bottle!!</li>
    <li> Use everyday over my body &amp; face after my  evening  shower....keeps my skin looking golden &amp; sexy soft to touch!</li>
    <li> Gave me such a nice natural glow. People had no idea it was from lotion. One tip - don&#x27;t apply to peeling skin! It will show!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  I don&#x27;t seem to benefit from the &amp;#34;Touch of Tan&amp;#34;, however, the lotion itself is perfect for all over your face and body.  Everyone of my friends who has stopped over and needed a bit of lotion, I always hand them this one first.  Everyone loves it as much as I do.  It is my go to lotion, even on my face when my &amp;#34;face lotion&amp;#34; is not available in that moment.  Like if I&#x27;m at the beach.  I carry this body lotion with me, and apply it to my face, also.  Just lovely and a wonderful scent, as well.  NOT an overwhelming fragrance, just a bit of a scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now. It&#x27;s been great so far. It&#x27;s moisturizing which is great since I live in Colorado and is very dry. The color develops nicely over time. Just make sure that your body is completely dry before washing hands. If you get any water on you after you apply the lotion,it will leave water streak. The scent at first is nice however after it dries it does smell like that typical self tanner. However overall a great product for its price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I put it on when I get out of the shower and it keeps my skin nice and soft all day and gives me a little bit of color without being orangy or overbearing. It still kinda has that saltine cracker smell that gradual tanners leave but it&#x27;s pretty subtle.</li>
    <li> Favorite lotion ever!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It is a very good product and it provides a great tan.</li>
    <li> After a lot of review reading, was a little skeptical trying this unheard of brand.  Very glad I did.  I am pale with pink undertones, my legs are neon white.  I have tried in my earlier years to tan and would burn then go back to white.  I finally gave up in my late teens and am health conscious so I wouldn&#x27;t subject my skin to the sun anyway at this point.  Being so pale also, I could never just go full on bronze and not look ridiculous.  I tried Jergen gradual tanning lotion first and was ok with results but 1) I don&#x27;t feel like it lasted 2) it was thicker and hard to evenly put on and 3) it did get considerably blotchy (everywhere) after 3-4 applications.  I felt like as soon as I got to the color I wanted I would have to scrub it all off.  Oh, and the smell was not great.  I felt kind of hopeless and was just going to go all in on some more expensive brand with good reviews everywhere when I found Amir touch of tan.  All I can say is...I&#x27;m no longer neon!  Color is pretty natural looking, if I were naturally darker I think it would look even better.  Lotion is nicely thin so it smooths on evenly and easily.  Smell is lovely and tropical...DHA smell is next to none.  I use at night mostly.  I also workout (hard) 5 days a week and it seems to hold up better than expected in that regard.  I&#x27;m never sweating it totally off and any blotchiness (if any) is way minimal.  I only ever gently exfoliate after a couple days with an exfoliating cloth and it does the trick--concentrate on top of hands, wrists, underside of forearm, elbows, armpit area, knees and ankles/feet.  This sometimes just needs a quick buff and is back to looking normal.  Also, a trick I like for daytime application is to mix half unscented cream with this to get an extra dose of glow but not have to worry about sweating/rubbing/scratching off spots during the day.  Plus I found it sets a little drier to the touch when it&#x27;s not so concentrated.  WASH YOUR HANDS and blend lightly down your wrists whendrying.  Lightly wipe your elbows knees and ankles after application.  Trust me.  Some aspects take a little trial and error but results are never an atrocity or anything.  Apply thoughtfully and it&#x27;s mostly idiot proof.  I hope this continues to be available as I would be so lost without it now!  Thank you thank you thank you for an amazing product at an amazing price!</li>
    <li> Pretty weak on the tanning, but a decent moisturizer nonetheless.  You won&#x27;t be orange, but you won&#x27;t be as dark as with some of the other competitors.</li>
    <li> My skin is kind of blueish white. Probably a lot of you are familiar with this color. &amp;#34;Lizard belly white&amp;#34; my family has been known to call it. Never tan, always burn, blah, blah, blah. You know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about right? I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanners, even ones for &amp;#34;fair skin&amp;#34;, and they&#x27;ve all been too dark. Either they look weirdly yellow/orange in sunlight, or they just make me look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34;, or (my favorite) both. (I&#x27;m going to be posting a review on Fake Bake Fair with just this very issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amir Argan Oil has &amp;#34;just a pinch&amp;#34; of DHA in it. In fact, it&#x27;s the *eighth* ingredient on the list. This lets the tan build up slowly, so you can control very precisely how much glow you want. (I&#x27;m pretty sure that this will never make you &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34;. This really is designed for just taking the edge off the white.) It&#x27;s also very forgiving about not putting it on exactly right. Missed a spot yesterday? You won&#x27;t be able to tell after just one application, and you&#x27;ll be sure to get it next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is entirely subjective. I think it smells a little fruity/tropical. I like it. I never do smell the DHA. My husband loves the way this smells. The smell does fade after an hour or so. Your nose may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked wonders for my skin! My skin has been dry and itchy and this resolved that with the very first application. I will definitely repurchase this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I see is that it doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;trace&amp;#34;. That telltale bit of color that washes off when you take a shower, but lets you know if you missed a spot. I have two solutions for that.&lt;br /&gt;1. Mix the oil with a little unsweetened cocoa powder. The cocoa powder will easily wash off. (Don&#x27;t let your pets lick it off, though!).&lt;br /&gt;2. Buy the smallest bottle possible of Fake Bake Fair and mix it with this. You&#x27;ll have to find your own perfect ratio, but I&#x27;d recommend starting with 8 pumps of this and 1/2 tsp of the Fake Bake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something like 80% of the world&#x27;s population has a yellow undertone for their skin, so DHA works great for them. However, for those of us that are blue/pink based anything with DHA will look &amp;#34;too yellow/orange&amp;#34;. The only reason this one doesn&#x27;t is because it is so light. It really is just a kiss of color. So, having said that, if you do have a little bit of tan on your arms, this won&#x27;t be a perfect color match. But really, unless you are the local contortionist, you usually don&#x27;t have your arms and legs right next to each other for comparison. Viewed in real world situations, it looks good and doesn&#x27;t look orange at all.d&#x27;s population has a yellow undertone for their skin, so DHA works great for them.

    <li> Goes on like silk and smells so good, this product is awesome!!!  Will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, nice glowing ten as well!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with my whole fair-skinned/rosy-cheeked/dark-hair look, but when you move to South Florida and it&#x27;s hot and you don&#x27;t feel like blinding people with your pasty-blue pallor, this is the product to use! Granted, I have not tried many products over the years, but I did fear an orange, streaky look nonetheless. With Touch of Tan, I have none of that. It took a few applications to really notice a difference but I like what I see--it&#x27;s just enough tan to take the pasty away. Anything else on my white skin would seem unnatural, I think. I use it on my face even with no problem. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer. And I LOVE the smell!!!! One small drawback is that it seems to rub off where my bra straps are... but I kind of like it, looks like *real* tan lines lol! Tip: don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands after applying or your palms will get a little orangy.</li>
    <li> Smells good but when I opened the box, the top was off and all of the lotion was in the box. Had to trash it. Very disappointed at the packaging</li>
    <li> this product arrived super quickly and was packaged nicely. i would have to say though that i am a little disappointed with the results. i dont see any color difference at all after applying. I even tried 3 coats last time and still no sun like touch:(  it smells good and works fine as a lotion, so thats good.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty awesome. I&#x27;d think of it as more of a &amp;#34;lotion +&amp;#34; rather than a self tanning product. I can see why some reviews complain that this isn&#x27;t good at tanning. It&#x27;s a lotion that you could use everyday that will give you a subtle tan over a few applications (and I think it only fully activates after 12 hours or so), but won&#x27;t give you a deep tan after one use. It&#x27;s perfect for very pale girls like me who don&#x27;t want to blind people with their paleness, but also don&#x27;t want to look like they&#x27;ve &amp;#34;been tanning&amp;#34;. So if this is what you want, then gosh-darn it, buy this stuff! Also it smells DIVINE.</li>
    <li> Smells great, takes half a bottle to add the slightest hint of color. If it weren&#x27;t a tanner, I&#x27;d be thrilled. However that is what I purchased it for. :(</li>
    <li> For me, this is the perfect tanning lotion. It gives you JUST enough color; It definitely is not an instant tan but I like that b/c you don&#x27;t have to be super careful applying it. You can put it on like lotion, it smells good, and after a few applications you have a really nice mellow tan. I&#x27;ve used lots of other tanning lotions and this is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer with the added benefit of giving you that slight tan look... I hate self tanners... most I&#x27;ve tried are either too dark, too orange, too streaky, etc.  This product is cream colored like a moisturizer but it&#x27;s not hard to tell where you&#x27;ve put it because you can see the difference in dryness.  Do not expect to get some golden tan from it but it certainly takes that winter white skin and tones it down with a light tan color.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, just once a day, and I&#x27;m happy with the results.  I&#x27;m going to start using twice a day for a darker effect.</li>
    <li> It smells so good and the touch of tan is just right (does not look fake).  I&#x27;ve had many people tell me I smell good when I use it.  I will buy it through Amazon from now on because Boston Beauty Supply no longer carries it.  I hope more people find out about it so they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> I got some white glow stick.legs. this stuff smells great and I like it but no.color after a week.using it. Went to jurgens and that stuff works</li>
    <li> Saw this at a salon I go to.  Didn&#x27;t want to pay full price..so I wrote the name down after I got to try a sample.  It smells like a day at the beach and got it so cheap!  Would definitely buy from again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been meaning the write a review of this and change another a review of what I &#x27;thought&#x27; was the best lotion ever for fair skinned people.  THIS is the best lotion EVER!!! Let me preface this by saying that I&#x27;m a VERY FAIR SKINNED REDHEAD. So fair skinned... that people ask if I feel ok on a regular basis. If you think you are fair but you can tan, this product isn&#x27;t for you.  This is for people who would a like a VERY SUBTLE &#x27;touch of tan&#x27;. I put it on and I can slightly tell that I have a tinge of color.  It&#x27;s wonderful.  The curse of being so fair skinned is that the darker you go, the noticeable it is when you&#x27;ve really screwed up your tanning job. I have even gone to those air tan spray places where they spray it on you and I still looked &#x27;exotic&#x27; on their lightest setting. When it would fade away, it would look like I had a disease from the 1920&#x27;s or something... if anyone knows what I&#x27;m talking about, this product... BUY IT! It smells wonderful, it feels luxurious, lasts a while. Only problem I had was the top wasn&#x27;t very secure when I popped the pump out. But it seems to be fine!</li>
    <li> It was not what I expected.It didn&#x27;t give me a tan</li>
    <li> After deciding during the brutal Boston winter that I needed a little bit of color, I considered my options. Going tanning is out of the question (paying my hard earned money for skin cancer? No thanks), and I was intimidated by the various spray tans, spray mousses, and other products out there that deliver some serious darkness (and you need to apply them with a &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34;...I&#x27;m too low maintenance for that). I didn&#x27;t want to walk into work the day after a self-tanning session with everyone asking me &amp;#34;How did you get so tan?...It&#x27;s February&amp;#34;, but I wanted a healthy glow, so I figured finding something that would offer a gradual tan would be my best bet. I also have a rather restrictive budget so I figured this was the perfect choice, at around 11 dollars for a decently large bottle. To top it off, I read all of the raving reviews on this product and thought it would be exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read enough reviews on tanning products that I knew the basics of how to use it properly: exfoliate thoroughly in the shower (I use Tree Hut Shea Sugar Scrub...love it), make sure you apply evenly and be careful around knees/elbows/ankles so it doesn&#x27;t come out uneven, wash hands thoroughly afterwards so you don&#x27;t spread the brown color everywhere, don&#x27;t put on clothes for a while so it can all absorb, etc. I followed the instructions carefully every time, and used it religiously every other day for about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the three weeks, I was rather disappointed. Although this makes for a great moisturizer and smells great (hence the two stars), my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; was virtually nonexistent. I was just as pale as I had been three weeks earlier trudging through the four feet of snow in my driveway. So if you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re looking for a gradual tan that will give you a nice glow, I suggest you keep looking. If you&#x27;re just looking for a good moisturizer in a lovely pumpbottle, by all means buy this one.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice light tan and does not smell bad at all, actually smells good</li>
    <li> Very nice how it feels when putting on and after.  Doesn&#x27;t leave sticky feeling, just smooth to the touch and lightly tans.  I would purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,</li>
    <li> Feels so nice on my skin and does a nice job no orange just a gentle tan...</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been this happy with a product in a long time. After only 2 uses, my skin is evenly toned, tanned, and gorgeous. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this item enough!</li>
    <li> Thank you for fast, efficient delivery I do not see nor feel anything different about this product. &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; is cited.....it has the same effect on my skin as this product had last year.  The colour is OK. My problem, even after a swim in the Pacific ocean and a fresh water shower, is that a brown colour comes off on my washcloth while cleaning myself with a mild soap in my usual night time cleansing routine.  I was hoping that &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; meant this problem had been eliminated.. . Disappointed.  ED</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably great for females with smooth skin, beware if you put it on wherever you have body hair or facial hair, it will not be even and will look blotchy and orange after a couple uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m blonde hair, blue eyes – very light skin. This is this turns my skin a streaky brown and yellow. Perhaps it&#x27;s better with someone with darker skin.</li>
    <li> When I bought this I originally got on Amazon to find a bronzer that I had seen advertised from the body shop. However after reading many bad reviews for the body shop bronzer I decided against buying it and turned my attention towards this recommendation. Many other people gave this product glowing reviews (pun intended). It seemed cheap enough for me to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can now say I am very very pleased with this product. No wonder so many people liked it. It smells great!!! I know other people might be annoyed by it but my husband that says it smells like a pina colada. So drink it up!  Because I can wear it all day every day. Now it does say a touch of tan and literally it is a minute touch because I applied it multiple times a day just to see some results faster. With that said like all tanning lotions it can become darker around areas like knees and elbows. However it still wasn&#x27;t like the fake orange stuff that comes with other products. I found that if I exfoliated well in the shower that it didn&#x27;t absorb as much they are in those areas and it looks more natural. And as always its recommended to wash your hands after using it. So that you don&#x27;t have that orange stuff on your hands even then it&#x27;s very minor. It provides the perfect light glow and also adds to any natural tan that you might have already received from the sun. I love this product I&#x27;ve almost used half the bottle in two weeks. It goes on just like a creamy lotion would. So it&#x27;s easy to spread over your entire body. I love putting this on after I get out of the shower and it&#x27;s going to be one of those things I will buy over and over again. I&#x27;m really glad I stumbled across this product!</li>
    <li> Cannot use do to something in it and the smell.</li>
    <li> Delivered on-time and a great lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is smells WONDERFUL, a light coconut smell is so much better than any other tanning lotion I have ever tried.  The lotion is light weight and not too greasy.  It gives a nice natural color.</li>
    <li> I had my hopes up on the scent after reading the reviews.  I really dislike the smell of the self tanners and this one was supposed to not have it.  It does smell like coconut initially, when you put it on your hands and spread it over your body.  However, that smell goes away and gives way to the typical self tanner smell which lingers on for a long time.  Even after a shower, I smell it on my skin. I&#x27;m disappointed.  From moisturizing perspective, it&#x27;s a fine moisturizer but that&#x27;s not what I bought it for.</li>
    <li> Obsessed with this!  I have yellow undertones so this gives me the perfect glow without turing me an unnatural color! And the bonus is I typically use argan oil all winter as moisturizer but this gives me best of both worlds good color &amp; skin hydration!</li>
    <li> it takes a few applications for color but it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and it smells awesome!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me (as a self-tan)</li>
    <li> Used this lotion until I ran out. I was turning the bottle upside down to get the very last of it out....LOL!It makes your skin very smooth and adds a lovely tint....smells great!</li>
    <li> Very little turns your skin orange even after exfoliation. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless you&#x27;re going on stage as an Oompa Loompa.</li>
    <li> Like most women, I have tried MANY of self-tanners, bronzers, etc. in all their forms (lotion, spray, wipe, etc.) I have tried Neutrogena, Jergens, L&#x27;Oreal, Banana Boat, Hawaiian Tropic... All of them had MANY cons (sticky, streaking, blotchiness, uneven, not enough product, HORRIBLE SMELL...) which caused me to continuously hop around, and keep searching for a near &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; self-tanner for me. I have sensitive, fair, caucasian skin, with a mainly yellow undertone. I came to Amazon as I normally do, to find a new tanning lotion for the season. After stumbling across this one, with its decent price and positive reviews, I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, that the other reviewers who said that this smells great were right! It has a very light, kind of fruity smell, which is pleasant. Probably because it is an oil based lotion, one pump nearly covered an entire leg from foot to thigh, which is very impressive, and I am the Queen of over-using lotions and moisturizers. It is a white-colored lotion, which turns translucent on your skin once rubbed in. I put it on after I shower at night before I go to bed. The smell stayed pleasant the entire night into the next day, and did not turn into that nasty &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34; DHA smell that most do once they develop. The color developed into a believable, light, golden glowy color after first use, which I will keep on building on, and there was no blotches or streaks! I highly recommend trying this product! :)</li>
    <li> I will purchase this again &amp; again. You&#x27;re darker after just one use. It has a nice, coconut kind of smell. No fake tanner smell. Looks &amp; feels beautiful. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My skin broke out :-( Smells delicious though!! But I was barely able to use it</li>
    <li> does&#x27;t streak, not real dark which is a good thing but it does look a little yellowish at times</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  You can&#x27;t go wrong if you are looking for a moisturizer that softens your skin and gives you just a hint of a tan. With more use the darker the tan is and you never have that orange spray tan look.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer lotion not only smells wonderful, but also feels great on your skin.  The &amp;#34;Touch of Tan&amp;#34; slightly tans the skin without turning it orange as most bronzers do.  Great product!  I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I use Amir after my shower to moisturize and give my skin a  slight bit of color.  It has a pleasant mild fragrance. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth, I am using it daily for a little color on my legs before I go to the beach. I have the SPF 15 as well, they are both great!</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer.  Love the smell.  and hopefully will notice the touch of tan soon.  will keep using and buy more.</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird. I only used it for about a week, didn&#x27;t really change my extremely fair skin much at all. Pretty hydrating tho, works well as lotion.</li>
    <li> It works great for pale people and looks natural. It takes several days to see a a significant difference. It does stain light colored undergarments. I love the smell and will definitely keep using it. It&#x27;s the staining of my bra that cost it a star, but it works too well for me to stop using it.</li>
    <li> moisturizer is great.  does not give you a lot of color all at once</li>
    <li> Use everytme I shower and got some color.  My only issue is the length of time it takes to dry on the skin.  Otherwise, smells good and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Works great after about a week. Doesn&#x27;t smell or feel bad like most sunless products. I will definitely buy agin.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing!  It&#x27;s thick and creamy, yet absorbs quickly.  A superb moisturizer. The smell is wonderfully fresh and light.  Contains just enough self tanner to give your skin a gradual, healthy glow that doesn&#x27;t appear orange or fake.  I am so pleased with this lotion.  I use it every day and have recommended it to all my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pale, exfoliated before I put it on, and it streaked like crazy. I was very careful to put in on evenly, but the color is dark enough that it just didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;d say this isn&#x27;t made for extremely pasty, white girls--likr myself. But probably if you have a bit of a natural tan, it would be alright.</li>
    <li> The first bottle I bought of this was phenomenal-- it left no streaks and I wasn&#x27;t orange at all. The second bottle that I bought was the complete opposite. I am currently so orange and streaked that I cant even wear anything that shows any of my skin.</li>
    <li> AMAZING. It instantly absorbs evenly into your skin without being greasy or heavy. Leaves your skin perfectly moisturized in seconds!!!!! Also gives a natural looking glow to your skin &amp; smells very tropical. Wow. You will NOT regret buying this.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and natural progressive tan. I really like it!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.  Been using it for years.  Leaves skin soft and not at all oily; smells lovely.  No yellow or orange color to skin when using it.  No streaks.  Product tans according to how often you apply it even without sun.  I get occasional sun and it speeds up the tanning process if used.  Recommend it to anyone with fair to medium skin tone who wants a bit more color.  Even works on faces!</li>
    <li> This will gradually add nice color to your skin &amp; moisturize. Leaves skin feeling &amp; looking very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a little color &amp; smooth this is great.</li>
    <li> Still has a slight smell and still leaves the tan between fingers. Suggestion I shower twice a day if you do the same use at night then wash hands do not use in the am shower then you don&#x27;t smell the gradual color is nice and it makes your shin refreshed and look younger</li>
    <li> Unbelievable. I have pale white skin and am unable to tan so I have searched and used sunless tanners since the very first ones came out many years ago. Since the beginning, I have looked for one that gives a beautiful color (a soft natural light brown----not yellow or orange) and does not dry out the skin. This one fits those criteria but goes a step further: it does not darken the age spots that skin tends to get after we turn 30 or so. That in itself would have been enough to sell me but the color is so beautiful and my skin is not dry so this one is definitely my all-time fave.&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope this product is around for a very long time!</li>
    <li> I like it: it smells great, no funky self tanner smell, it&#x27;s light and spreads/soaks in well, and is a great moisturizer. The reason for 4 stars versus 5 is because of the tanning, which is the reason you buy a self tanner lotion. After using it consistently for about two weeks I barely have any color with daily use. In the past I&#x27;ve used Jergen&#x27;s (for Fair/Medium Skin) which gives me a noticeable golden glow on 3 days. Amir Argan Oil &amp;#34;Touch of Tan&amp;#34; is just that: a &amp;#34;touch&amp;#34; of tan. On the plus side it does so little there&#x27;s no worry of streaks, and the slight color it does give is natural looking. If your main reason to purchase this is to get tan then I would suggest something different - because let&#x27;s face it, this is way more expensive than regular moisturizer. That being said I do really like this and will continue to use it as moisturizer over the winter, but come summer months when I want to look tan (without sunburning my skin) I&#x27;ll switch back to Jergen&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a few days ago. When it arrived and I opened the package the bottle was opened and upside down. Lotion was everywhere! I expect better handling and packaging. The product itself so far is great for moisturizing but havent noticed a difference as far as color.</li>
    <li> good value, nice scent, very light tanning agent</li>
    <li> I got this for sister. She loves touch of tan. It is a real natural tan.</li>
    <li> With daily use for weeks I&#x27;ve yet to see any results. I will use up the bottle because it works fine as a moisturizer and smells good, but I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and smell. Gives a little bit of color, not so much so it&#x27;s will noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;Will order it again.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes well, yet the fragrance is way too potent.&lt;br /&gt;Has a tropical, sweet, coconutty fragrance - kinda like a tanning lotion for indoor tanning beds. So, so.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Shows up almost immediately on olive toned skin.  Great moisturizer,- dries quickly and leaves skin very smooth. The fragrance isn&#x27;t as strong as I expected and unlike other moisturizing tanners that linger. Generous bottle. I am definitely buying this again!</li>
    <li> Rich moisturizing lotion that delivers a light golden tint.  I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years, and I love it!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like this quite as much as the regular Amir Argan Oil Moisturizer.  It has a&lt;br /&gt;little of that &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34; smell as opposed to the yummy fragrance of the regular&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I will be ordering it again. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and have tried many many options . Amir is s great lotion and I love argan oil - and the little bit of color never goes a miss. Seriously though it is a good moisturizer and the smell isn&#x27;t over powering it absorbs quickly and cleanly -</li>
    <li> This is a must have for a daily and nighttime moisturizer. Only a small amount goes a long way. It&#x27;s also great for mixing with my self-tanning lotion, for a more evenly applied tan. Sometimes, on the weekends, I rub a bit through my hair and do a deep conditioning. Light weight, to the feel, and a nice calming fragrance. This is now part of my daily regime now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll never buy another type of &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34;. This has been AMAZING in just 2 applications. I&#x27;ve tried Jergens glow and a few others, but this by FAR gives an extremely nature looking tan. It&#x27;s not streaky, orange or horrible smelling. I LOVE the smell! I had sunburn a week ago, and because of my fair skin I knew I would peel and go back to pale white. I applied this and I didn&#x27;t peel, I haven&#x27;t gone by to pale white and I look like I was kissed by the sun. My legs no longer look like I’ve come out of a bomb shelter after 32 years. I have a wonderful subtle tan and now I look forward to wearing shorts! A little goes a long way. Although it takes a few minutes to air dry before I’d want to put any clothing over it - I’ll never buy something else.</li>
    <li> I bought this self-tanner after my hair stylist raved about it. After sparingly using tanning beds, I swore them off completely as a healthier life choice. As a New Englander, self-tanners are my only year-round option, but I hate the smell and feel of most of them (Jergens, Neutrogena...). Amir &amp;#34;Touch of Tan&amp;#34; smells phenomenal, like a tropical drink! It also absorbs into the skin very fast, which is perfect, because who has time to let self-tanner air dry every single day?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Complexion: I&#x27;m very fair (Irish, French, English...), but I also have some Mediterranean roots, so my skin has the slightest tinge of olive. This product gives me a very natural year-round glow, and it&#x27;s the perfect base for summer.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful lotion. The coconut scent is very strong, but not overwhelming. You just feel like your at the beach at all times. It makes you feel so fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Subtle color, not orange, over about three applications.  No streaking or offensive odor.</li>
    <li> This after tan (or anytime) lotion is great. The fragrance is wonderful and the moisturizer make your skin look and feel great.  It adds a little self-tanner to keep the tan look.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer and a hint of color, but not too much - I am a constant reorderer.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, one I reach for daily.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t spend much time in the sun but I don&#x27;t want to look pale and pasty. So I slather this on a few times a week and now I have a nice subtle color that doesn&#x27;t look orange or streaky. I was leery about trying a tanning lotion again because the last one I tried looked orange and fake. This one looks subtle and natural. If I used it more often it would probably get darker, but I wanted subtle which is exactly what I got. Also it feels nice &amp; silky going on. Plus I don&#x27;t dislike the smell, and often I hate the chemical smell of beauty products. It&#x27;s a nice big bottle for the price, and free shipping with amazon prime. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great.</li>
    <li> It is easy to tell where you have put this lotion and it has a pleasant professional tanning scent. It feels heavy at first but then your skin soaks it up and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy after that.. Also, you won&#x27;t be tan right after putting this lotion on.. it takes some time before it shows up on your skin. I am very pleased as I look sunkissed and the tan looks natural. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep, instant spray tan, look elsewhere. This is perfect for me and I plan on purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Love this product smells great too! After spending the past 5 years with in laws and hubby fighting cancer, I&#x27;d given up on tanning. I&#x27;ve stayed out of the sun however, I m so pale I&#x27;ve been experimenting with lotions. I use to use &amp;#34;famous Dave&#x27;s&amp;#34; until his customer service and product change. This is my new must have tan lotion!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 6 months pregnant and really wanted to find a good sunless tanner to help me feel thin again!  I cannot stand the DHA smell of pretty much every sunless tanner on the market.  But this stuff smells delicious and I didn&#x27;t smell it at all (and I have a very heightened sense of smell with the pregnancy!).  It reminds me of the lotion you would put on before getting in the tanning bed (the couple of times I did that in high school).  The only time I smelled a hint of DHA was in the shower the next morning.  That was it.  Anyway, I have fair skin, but there was a noticeable difference in color after one application to my winter skin (I was generous with the amount I applied).  I only applied it to my legs. I didn&#x27;t notice any streakiness or orange tint.... I did put it sparsely on my ankles and feet just in case.  The next day I applied it again, for a darker tone.  I thought 2 applications gave the perfect result.  After using it on my legs and being happy with the result, I tried it on my decolletage, shoulders and belly.  Again, it looked fine.  I will probably try it on my arms next, and just go easy around the wrists just in case.  For this price, you should give it a try.  It feels silky and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> The best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever bought. No streaks, and has a great smell!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several years and love it above all of the other self tanning lotions out there.  It isn&#x27;t quite as strong smelling as the others, doesn&#x27;t streak or leave you looking orange.  I always mix it with my body moisturizing lotion for a smooth and even result.</li>
    <li> Amazing scent, similar to coconut! Never turns into that horrible smell like most tanning lotions. Good moisturizer and subtle glow!</li>
    <li> smells like heaven and gives a  bit of tan</li>
    <li> Be careful if you apply this lotion and live where it&#x27;s warm or intend to work out the same day. I applied this lotion in the AM after a shower and in the evening I went to work out. My white tank top turned brown from sweating the lotion off. Embarrassing!</li>
    <li> I may have a sensitive nose, but I don&#x27;t think the scent in this is light at all like so many other reviews state.  I feel like I just got doused in coconut perfume.  I also find it a little greasy and the \\&quot;touch\\&quot; of sunless tan hasn&#x27;t done a thing for me.  I got a little color after three uses and it was gone the next day.  If you&#x27;re light skinned and don&#x27;t want to have to slather up every single day, I think you&#x27;re better off with a more concentrated product.</li>
    <li> This is the one for me!  Goes on like lotion and dries pretty quick; I can get dressed after 10 minutes.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different tanning lotions and usually can&#x27;t stand to be around myself with the chemical smell coming off my skin.  With this lotion, I do not get really dark, but with every day use, I get just enough of a color change that looks natural.  It&#x27;s more of a moisturizer with the benefit of a little color.  It has a coconut smell that stays with you all day - but it&#x27;s not nasty or chemical-smelly.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and still love it.</li>
    <li> I agree with others, product is great.  Gives great moisture and a nice natural looking &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;.  My skin feels great!  I gave is 4 stars because of the smell.  It&#x27;s too strong for me - very coconuty and a little much.  Makers: would you ever consider a scentless version?</li>
    <li> I have lily-white skin that burns within 10 minutes of direct sun even with SPF 100.  I have never, in my 40+ years, had a natural tan, despite my best tanning-bed efforts in my teens and early-20&#x27;s.  I have, though, spent more than my fair share of days looking like an Oompa-Loompa suffering from an overdose of beta-carotene and smelling faintly of cadaver paint, thanks to the 30 or so self-tanning products and bronzers I&#x27;ve tried over the past 2 decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally.  I have found The Holy Grail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff arrived early Saturday morning, and I wasn&#x27;t going to jump on applying it, but it SMELLED SOOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!  So, I applied it post-shower.  From a lotion standpoint, it&#x27;s fantastic - tropical coconut-pineapple-y smell, not greasy, a little goes a long way (literally, one pump was enough for both my arms), sinks in quickly and skin feels nice afterwards.  At this point, I was thinking if this doesn&#x27;t work as a tanner, I&#x27;m going to check to see if they have straight-up lotion, because I&#x27;m already impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I go about my errands, occasionally noticing that I&#x27;m not turning orange and I don&#x27;t stink.  Good...very good.  But I also don&#x27;t notice that I&#x27;m turning brown.  Too bad.  But skin still feels soft.  Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 6 PM, I am changing to go out for the night.  I still don&#x27;t notice any tanning effects, but since I liked the smell of the lotion, I reapplied on my arms and face. Yes, this is non-greasy enough that you can wear it under makeup, if you give it a few minutes to sink in, just like any other moisturizer.  My skin is pretty sensitive, and this did not irritate at all.  I  got a lot of compliments on how good I smell that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washing up that night, I think I notice I look a little sun-kissed, but I&#x27;m too tired to care that much.  However, Sunday morning.....fabulous!  The most natural-looking bronze I have ever had!  It looked great!  Now, as I said, I am as pale as milk, and even the slightest bit of tannish color is a big deal for me - so I&#x27;m not talking Coppertone Babe or anything like that (and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m shooting for).  But I went ahead and applied again that morning and again before bed, and this morning (Monday) my husband said &amp;#34;I honestly cannot believe you are getting that from lotion - it looks like you just came back from vacation&amp;#34;.  Now - again - I am PALE and this has just given me a nice sun-kissed, even, natural-looking bronze.  I don&#x27;t know if it can achieve a full Jersey Shore-worthy mahogany, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for.  But if you want to keep it real, go for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note - this tanner is way more forgiving than other formulas, because it builds color slowly - no streaks or obvious &#x27;edges&#x27;.  I am fairly addicted to exfoliating, so I don&#x27;t know if you will get stellar results without a rigorous sloughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product, and will definitely buy it again.  Very, very pleased.st bit of tannish color is a big deal for me - so I&#x27;m not talking Coppertone Babe or anything like that (and that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m shooting for).

    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about the lotions I use, but I love this one! I actually started using this on my face as well, which is generally a huge no-no for me, but I&#x27;ve been using it for close to 6 months now with no problems. I do have normal, good skin and I&#x27;m not normally prone to breakouts but some lotions have made me break out. If you have sensitive or over oily skin you might not want to use it on your face, it just happens to work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing it to many other lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past,&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;No greasy feeling or residue, leaves the skin soft and smooth, doesn&#x27;t irritate after shaving, has a nice smell, does seem to lightly tan and promotes a better tan, doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts, goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m really sensitive to fragrances and I&#x27;m allergic to a lot of cosmetics, but I&#x27;m completely fine with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t really any for me personally, although I could see how the smell could be a little much for some people. It does smell a little like tanning lotions, and the scent of the lotion lasts. This could be a good or bad thing depending on how you feel about the scent, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. The touch of sun is exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of argan oil and this looked like a great self tanner option. The lotion itself is nice but the touch if tan is very very light even with repeated applications. I will use this as a moisturizer but will go back to jergens med/tan for color. I am very fair skinned , tend to burn before tan in sun.</li>
    <li> Fragrance unbelievably strong. Had to give it away</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  Smells heavenly and is not greasy.  I use it every day to moisturizer my skin.</li>
    <li> Very nice lotion. Has the plus of giving you a little color. Absorbs well. Makes your skin soft.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this a few times.  Awesome sent and gradual color.  Never have I experienced orange or streaking with this product and I love it so much more than jeans natural glow</li>
    <li> I received this product really quick! It is absolutely wonderful!! It has a beautiful fragrance, goes on smooth, sinks in quickly, and if you rub it in leaves no streaking. It provides a nice hint of color to build on. I will reorder this product again from this seller. A win, win situation all the way around!!!! Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Touch of Tan Amir Argan Oil is a great product.  It enhances your tan.  Your tan lasts much longer.  However, you need to shake the moisturizer before applying to skin, otherwise, your skin will turn orange.  It is a GREAT product.  Skin stays soft.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Amir touch of tan moisturizer but got the moisturizer without the touch of tan.  I like to get what I order not a different product.</li>
    <li> Great lotion and darkens skin lightly without looking fake or orange so on my freshly shaved head, I don&#x27;t look like a cue ball. I use it for 1-2 days after a fresh shave and it looks as if my head has gotten a weeks worth of sun. Perfect!</li>
    <li> I give up. Based on other reviews I decided to try this product. Sadly, it did nothing for me. I have tried other products and was really hoping this would work.  No more trials of self-tanning products for me.  Wasted too much money.</li>
    <li> I do like this moisterizer.  My skin has a nice bronze glow.  Unfortunately it does not have an sun protection.</li>
    <li> If you are looking to get bronzed, this is not the product for you. If there is a way for this company to get a little more color into the bottle, it would be perfection for this fair skinned girl.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is do look good, but it only gives a barely notoceable glow.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, smooths skin, not greasy or oily. Have been using this product for a couple years and love it!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really give you much of a tan, just a little, but nice moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This lotion is amazing. Unlike most self tanners, you can use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t make you stink. It just gives a nice glow to the skin. It smells wonderful. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> It takes alot to impress me so let me start by saying this product is awesome! Use it as a daily moisturizer each night (exfoliate beforehand). Using it this way u will develop the most beautiful natural streak free, even tan (NOT ORANGE, BROWN!). I will continue to use this product year round. I have used about every self tanner on the market from drugstore to HIGH END. The price of this product was so cheap, I was very hesitant to try it.  In no way was a expecting the results I got. I am hooked. It doesn&#x27;t have that self tanner smell, WHICH IS WHY IT&#x27;S SO EASY TO USE IT DAILY..in fact it smells nice.  My skin looks like I have a naturally brown skin tone.  If you are looking for that healthy look this is your product. I just used my first bottle and it lasted for about a month.  I purchased a few spares because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> I never used sunless tanner much before. This stuff actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to and doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or weird discolorations. The only thing is that it gets that sunless tanner smell after an hour or two and it is not pleasant.</li>
    <li> Not super impressed.  It is ok.</li>
    <li> This lotion is really nice. I actually returned today to buy another bottle, but apparently the price has doubled (from $11 in mid April to around $24 in mid May). I would have been a repeat customer, but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m paying that kind of increase. There are other great products out there.</li>
    <li> OMG, this smells sooooo good.  I&#x27;ll buy it over and over again just for the coconutty smell.  It does a great job moisturizing, too!  Tan is nice and subtle.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very dry skin and it works wonderful for moisturizing and also gives my skin a very even natural looking glow. Im 39 yrs old and have always dealed with acne and this product does not make my face break out at all! Love it! Will definitly buy again</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I continue to try these &amp;#34;self tanners&amp;#34;.  All I ever end up is orange... like I&#x27;ve been eating nothing but carrots.  Guess I&#x27;ll just have to stick with being pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this one DOES have a pleasant smell, and the moisturizer is pretty good (not great, just good).</li>
    <li> Really love this lotion smells wonderful</li>
    <li> The best thing about this is that I can&#x27;t smell any sunless tanning odor at all! It is a great moisturizer. I only give it 4 stars though, because it dosen&#x27;t give much color for summer. You do get a slight natural glow, but its barely noticable. It is not at all orange. I think it is great for winter months when you don&#x27;t want to look tan, but just have a healthy glow.</li>
    <li> OTC tanning lotions have always left a lot to be desire with me.  Knowing the benefits of Argan oil and trusting feedback by others I purchased this bottle.  Will always be glad I did.  I am fair and the tan is not overwhelming or orange.  I strongly dislike going out in warm-weather clothing with winter-white skin.  Hooray for this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly the touch of tan I was looking for. The smell however is still a little &amp;#34;self-tanner&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Great product. All you need in one bottle. Moisturing and touch of self tan, can&#x27;t ask for more. Love it!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, lightly moisturizing and the color is subtle. Be careful around your elbows, knees and ankles, mine turned a bit orange</li>
    <li> Really great moisturizer - i have medium/fair skin - not orange, smells great, not expensive. Used to use TanTowel lotion but this is cheaper and i think better. Go for it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff. I live in a very dry climate, so it is great for keeping my skin moisturized. The self tanner is a great added bonus.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it would work - I&#x27;m very pale - but thought I saw a difference after a week or so of daily use.  After two weeks I&#x27;m sure of it, and the kicker was when I waxed my legs and all the color came off in strips with the skin (this happens when you wax; it&#x27;s not the lotion&#x27;s fault.) So I&#x27;m building back up again.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer, too, and smells not nearly so strong as the other self-tanners I have used.</li>
    <li> This does have a little bit of a smell to it but nothing overpowering.  It also doesnt leave any skid marks which is good.</li>
    <li> It smells SO good and doesnt feel greasy. I&#x27;ve notice a slight tan but nothing drastic.  Will definetly be buying more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t color my skin as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell very good</li>
    <li> Nice lotion for the price; had been paying double the price at my salon.</li>
    <li> I like it. It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Haven&#x27;t noticed any tanning, but that isn&#x27;t really important to me. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> For all the pale girls out there!!!!! This stuff is GOLD!!! It does not I repeat does not make you orange at all. But I tested out one day and was so happy, the day after I applied more, even better! So even and like a real bronzed summer glow! Then I tried it a third day and ehhh wasn&#x27;t the best! So I figured applying it two nights in a row is the perfect amout to have amazing looking skin all year round! It smells so good and doesn&#x27;t her on any clothes. I&#x27;ve never used something like this. Trust me I&#x27;ve tried it all!!! If you&#x27;re pale and need some color without the harsh sun or during the winter this is for you!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the smell of this lotion... and it&#x27;s so hydrating on my skin. Haven&#x27;t noticed any tan yet, but it&#x27;s only been a week. I&#x27;ll be patient and update accordingly :)</li>
    <li> Just like the others described! Doesn&#x27;t look orang-y and doesn&#x27;t have the weird fake tan smell. Im so glad I brought this. And the bottle is huge! Great deal for the money. Will definitely be repurchasing this one to keep me glowing! Love love love. Worth a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> One of the better ones I&#x27;ve tried.  Nothing is as good as a natural tan, but this comes close. I&#x27;ve had basal cell cancer, so this product is the one I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
    <li> Good product and effective. I would and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, darkens things up well, and smoothes over your skin beautifully!</li>
    <li> good color, smells great and leaves my skin feeling amazing all day long.</li>
    <li> Nice size for price color developed well.</li>
    <li> Smells and works great!</li>
    <li> Just the right amount of glow with great moisturizing</li>
    <li> Not at all what it says. I seen little to no results. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Having used a few different gradual tanning lotions I can only give this three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Good moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Blends into the skin well&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell, not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Almost no color ( This is a big one, as the primary reason for using the lotion is to gradually gain a tan)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malibu Hemp Bronzer has the same exact pros, and also gives you great color!  This is it on Amazon: http://amzn.to/1DCV3nm</li>
    <li> I just started using this 1 day ago and so far it&#x27;s amazing. It smells like candy and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. It&#x27;s not watery, which I love esp. when it&#x27;s hot outside and watery lotions tend to melt on me in the heat. I like that it has a subtle tanning effect to help keep my summer tan, but I&#x27;m EXTREMELY happy is doesn&#x27;t have that nasty self-tanning lotion scent. A little pump goes a long way and gives you the advantage of massaging the lotion on your skin until it&#x27;s absorbed- which I like.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I use it only at night before bed because I don&#x27;t like the smell after it&#x27;s been on my body a couple hours. Otherwise, love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, and I don&#x27;t normally use moisturizers. I learned about this product when I asked a lady friend where she had gotten her attractive color in the middle of winter. This lotion works very nicely to get rid of the &amp;#34;winter whites&amp;#34; and winter dry skin at the same time. The tanning effect is real and the color is natural-looking. However, the effect does not scream with that overdone, spray-tan look. Also, because the tanning effect is subtle, I don&#x27;t have issues with streaking. The product has a coconut-like fragrance that I could do without. I leaves my skin moisturized and a bit sticky feeling (so 4 stars), but I&#x27;m not accustomed to using body lotions. The tanning effect lasts about a week.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on very smoothly and smells nice.  I wish it had more self-tanner in it. I would buy it again if the price was right.</li>
    <li> Nothing wrong with Amazon but this broke me out:-( but I have sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRODUCT.  My skin is olive tone, and the tan is just slight enough on me to look like I&#x27;ve been kissed by the sun.  No yellowing at all, so it&#x27;s safe for feet, elbows, knees, face.  Fragrance is beautiful----not like other self tanners at all.  This one is YUMMY and dries so very quickly.  One of the most outstanding property of this product is its moisturizing which is so saturated, leaving skin with a beautiful, healthy glow.  If I want a deeper, instant tan, I use Body Drench Spray on (medium to dark) in conjunction with this Argon Oil.  And you get a huge amount of Argon oil.  I was quite surprised at the amount.  Bought some for my daughter who is very fair complected, and it is beautiful on her. She gets so many compliments on the gorgeous fragrance. I only wish this product had an SPF factor in it as it would eliminate yet another step.. But, for now, I&#x27;m so happy with this product. Highly recommend it for all skin types---even for the guys!!</li>
    <li> Love love this lotion!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!! Very hydrating but not greasy and doesn&#x27;t have that smell other tanning lotions have. Beautiful subtle glow and great smell. Last a long time and I love the pump bottle.  Is much more easy to get out and apply.  Doesn&#x27;t  irritate my sensitive skin or break me out.</li>
    <li> Great product, please do not discontinue.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for face and body. It keeps my skin looking fresh and smooth. Will definately buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Bj&lt;br /&gt;Jacksonivlle, Fl</li>
    <li> Just got this I. And been using it for a few days.  I have to say I LOVE it. Makes my skin super soft, and smells awesome! Only thing is you have to read the back. It says wash your hands afterwards.  But im lazy so I didn&#x27;t haha. It will leave your hands yellow.  But still love it, and I will definitely wash my hands afterwards from now on..</li>
    <li> Amazing - I am fair completed and can never find the correct amount of tanning lotion usually to dark to light or looks so fake.  I could not believe how natural it looks on my skin. I had people complement me on the first use. The smell is wonderful there is a hint of the tanning smell later after u put it in.  But NOTHING like all the others I have used. The bottle is huge and will last so long. For the price you can&#x27;t best this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed I promise.</li>
    <li> Great body lotion/tanner. I used too frequently and got a headache. BUT I backed off to every other day and it is great. I love the way my skin feels. Remember to wash your hands as it will stain.</li>
    <li> Have only used once, will use more come summer. Nice scent, skin felt smooth, not orange that I noticed after one application.</li>
