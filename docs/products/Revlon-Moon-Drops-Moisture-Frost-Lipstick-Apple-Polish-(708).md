<li> The cover of it doesn&#x27;t stay on tight.</li>
<li> WHY does Revlon (and others) discontinue lipstick shades and not give the unsuspecting customer a heads up that it&#x27;s going to happen, or at least list a comparable shade in another line?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> just too expensive now, always used that color</li>
<li> So sad they stopped selling it</li>
<li> So sorry Revlon discontinued it.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m sad</li>
<li> So sad to see this shade retired as I have been wearing it for over 20 years.  </li>

    <li> I have used this color lipstick for over 10 years and I like the slight frost, and the moisture the product gives my lips.

    <li> This is the only lipstick I wear.  Revlon, in its \\&quot;wisdom\\&quot; has discontinued it.  The color is flattering, brings complements, and matches anything I wear.  I found 6 tubes in my internet search and bought all of them.  Revlon, what were you thinking???</li>
    <li> I was so glad to get this lipstick. I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. I love the color, the texture etc. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>

    <li> I have used Revlon Moon Drops Apple Polish #708 for many years.  I had been dissapointed when I couldn&#x27;t find the color, Apple Polish.  Had tried several other colors, and they just didn;t work for me.  So when I found it on Amazon and the right color I was soooooooo  happy.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love - Love this lipstick.  Great color for summer but I&#x27;m sad Revlon discontinued this item from their line.  Great to be able to find it on Amazon.com.</li>
