      <li>Looking for a scent like B&amp;B&#x27;s Coconut Vanille.... haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it!</li>
      <li>This fragrance is simply delicious and so much more than a straightforward vanilla scent.</li>
      <li>Love this perfume!</li>
      <li>I love the coconut notes!</li>
      <li>This scent is amazing.</li>
      <li>I liked it.  </li>
      <li>This product is effective and lasts for hours.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of vanilla coconut and the fact that this is a healthy brand name purchasing a no brainer.</li>
      <li>If you love coconut and vanilla, you will love wearing this fragrance!</li>
      <li>Best natural parfume.</li>
      <li>Very light coconut vanilla smell that has staying power.</li>
      <li>Still love the scent though</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>More vanilla than coconut.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s (14) favorite fragrance - she started with the rolllerball version and progressed to this one.</li>
      <li>I find this scent is always appropriate.  </li>
      <li>I love ittttt</li>
      <li>Totally love this fragrance and that they are safe to spray on your skin.</li>
      <li>I find it does smell more vanilla than coconut</li>
      <li>It does not smell like tanning lotion like most coconut fragrances do.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s because it has a beachy smell that appeals to most people.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s actually healthy.</li>
      <li>It smells very sweet.</li>
      <li>I love the light fragrance and always get compliments.</li>
      <li>I love how light and clean the fragrant is.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, smells creamy and dreamy, and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a light scent.  </li>
      <li>Not only does this smell great</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t strong, it doesn&#x27;t last and is just not as pleasant as I remember.</li>
      <li>since I love this so much.  </li>
      <li>I smelled this in a Sephora and loved it, so I finally decided to purchase it.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is sweet and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>I actually get in a better mood every time I get a whiff or even better - spray some in the sheets and wake up smelling like dessert, my cats never complain...    </li>
      <li>But it is a very deep, warm, rich vanilla.  </li>
      <li>I have received so many compliments on this, even from people who usually do not like vanilla or coconut smells.</li>
      <li>I love love love this product, the subtle smell, and the fact that it is an organic antioxidant along with other great attributes.</li>
      <li>I love the natural ingredients, and won&#x27;t ever buy another brand of perfume again.</li>
      <li>It simply smells like a warm island, bathed with tropical fragrance of its fruits and flowers.</li>
      <li>It is all natural with a refreshing scent.</li>
      <li>This time Lavanila blends its famous Madagascar vanilla bean with fresh, young coconut flesh, luscious hypnotic fragrance of Tiare flower, alluring Heliotrope and some musky, earthy sandalwood.</li>
      <li>However I usually switch scents throughout the year because I tend to like this one in the summer and a more warm scent in the winter.</li>
      <li>I also love the Vanilla Bean (the yellow box) from this brand, but that smells like pure cake, delish!    </li>
      <li>I first bought this Lavanila in a sample size to try it out, and as soon as I smelled it I was hooked and bought a whole bottle.</li>
      <li>Some scents -- even ones I have liked -- have irritated my eyes and/or nose when I first applied them, but that does not happen whatsoever with Lavanila, perhaps due to its all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>But still very fragrant.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really smell much coconut.  </li>
      <li>The smell is divine, - light, fresh, clean - I always get loads of compliments and it smells differently on every person who tries it - fresh and not-overpowering, especially for those who often suffer from &amp;#34;perfume headaches&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>, the scent was so sweet and lasting, you&#x27;d think i had sprayed it all over!</li>
      <li>Over the years I have tried many coconut and vanilla scents (recent ones include BBW Exotic Coconut, Sud Pacifique Vanile Extreme, The Body Shop Coconut, and Island Bath and Body Coconut Vanilla), but I&#x27;m always trying out different brands.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a try --</li>
      <li>No synthetic fragrances or oils are used, only 100% natural botanical extracts and added nutrients (30 essential vitamins and minerals and 19 amino acids) making this a healthy cocktail for the skin and the senses.</li>
      <li>At first it smells little strong but it mellows down to a pleasant glow of paradise, even a few hours after spraying some on</li>
      <li>I have several of the LaVanilla fragrances and have always noted that the scent was distinct, strong and long lasting.</li>
      <li>It is my new scent.</li>
      <li>This perfume arrived and the first thing I noticed was the packaging is different from the others I received.</li>
      <li>It is made with all-natural &amp; organic ingredients and completely free of harsh chemicals.</li>
      <li>Bottle could be larger because it goes fast.</li>
      <li>so you can wear to office or in a car with others (that are sensitive to perfumes).  </li>
      <li>I wish I could sample some of the other lavanila scents to see if I&#x27;d be interested in any of them.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This came discolored and didn&#x27;t smell like the one at Sephora....I ended up selling it on a local website for about $15.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s (14) favorite fragrance - she started with the rolllerball version and progressed to this one. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t contain the crazy amount of chemicals as most other fragrances.</li>
    <li> My heading says it all.  I get compliments all the time on this perfume.  And I am a person who loves and wears a lot of perfume.  However, none of the perfumes I wear get the reaction this one gets.  I think it&#x27;s because it has a beachy smell that appeals to most people. Perhaps it gives them warm, happy memories of being carefree on the beach with lots of happy, scantily clad people having fun!  Whatever the case, I can&#x27;t wear it without hearing, &amp;#34;You smell good!&amp;#34; several times from various people I encounter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it, I feel like I am in Hawaii and should be wearing a lei and/or a flower in my hair.  I&#x27;m into that vibe though, so it works for me!  It&#x27;s like automatic vacation!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! I went online to find the best vanilla scents and tried this one from a list of top vanilla perfumes. I love the coconut notes! I also got the Library of Flowers Parfum Crema-True Vanilla and I combine them sometimes as the LoFPC-TV scent is heavier on the vanilla side. I vary between using one or the other or both. And, I will buy both again when I run out!!</li>
    <li> I have several of the LaVanilla fragrances and have always noted that the scent was distinct, strong and long lasting. I smelled this in a Sephora and loved it, so I finally decided to purchase it. This perfume arrived and the first thing I noticed was the packaging is different from the others I received. I shrugged it off. Then I used it and was quite disappointed. The scent is just off from what I remember. It isn&#x27;t strong, it doesn&#x27;t last and is just not as pleasant as I remember. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a knock-off or if I&#x27;m just remembering it wrong, but at the very least I recommend purchasing from a legit seller.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is simply delicious and so much more than a straightforward vanilla scent. This time Lavanila blends its famous Madagascar vanilla bean with fresh, young coconut flesh, luscious hypnotic fragrance of Tiare flower, alluring Heliotrope and some musky, earthy sandalwood. It simply smells like a warm island, bathed with tropical fragrance of its fruits and flowers. At first it smells little strong but it mellows down to a pleasant glow of paradise, even a few hours after spraying some on I can sense the scent exuding up and through my clothes. I actually get in a better mood every time I get a whiff or even better - spray some in the sheets and wake up smelling like dessert, my cats never complain...    Not only does this smell great but it&#x27;s actually healthy. No synthetic fragrances or oils are used, only 100% natural botanical extracts and added nutrients (30 essential vitamins and minerals and 19 amino acids) making this a healthy cocktail for the skin and the senses. I also love the Vanilla Bean (the yellow box) from this brand, but that smells like pure cake, delish!    - Kasia S.</li>
    <li> This product is effective and lasts for hours. No alcohol smell, just vanilla and coconut. Bottle could be larger because it goes fast.</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous fragrance. Over the years I have tried many coconut and vanilla scents (recent ones include BBW Exotic Coconut, Sud Pacifique Vanile Extreme, The Body Shop Coconut, and Island Bath and Body Coconut Vanilla), but I&#x27;m always trying out different brands. I first bought this Lavanila in a sample size to try it out, and as soon as I smelled it I was hooked and bought a whole bottle. This is, hands-down, the best-smelling vanilla coconut scent I have ever tried. Some scents -- even ones I have liked -- have irritated my eyes and/or nose when I first applied them, but that does not happen whatsoever with Lavanila, perhaps due to its all natural ingredients. It goes on smooth, smells creamy and dreamy, and lasts all day. I have received so many compliments on this, even from people who usually do not like vanilla or coconut smells. I&#x27;d highly recommend giving it a try -- I&#x27;m very glad I did!</li>
    <li> As a cancer-survivor, it&#x27;s important to me to use non-toxic products, I LOVE Lavanilla products!!!! The smell is divine, - light, fresh, clean - I always get loads of compliments and it smells differently on every person who tries it - fresh and not-overpowering, especially for those who often suffer from &amp;#34;perfume headaches&amp;#34; - Incredibly disappointed Sephora no longer sells this product.  It&#x27;s a BIG winner</li>
    <li> I hate to share....since I love this so much.  I have been wearing this for a couple years.  Good for you and smells delicious.  Its not over powering so you can wear to office or in a car with others (that are sensitive to perfumes).  But when people do notice or comment that smell...I often get &amp;#34;you always smell so yummy&amp;#34;.  I love love love this product, the subtle smell, and the fact that it is an organic antioxidant along with other great attributes. It is made with all-natural &amp; organic ingredients and completely free of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is sweet and long-lasting. I got it cheaper on Amazon than I would have at Sephora.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to flowers and I was looking for a perfume without a floral scent. Lavanilla fits my needs perfectly. It is all natural with a refreshing scent. It is my new scent.</li>
    <li> Best natural parfume. I love the light fragrance and always get compliments.</li>
    <li> But still very fragrant. I get compliments on it all the time. I love the natural ingredients, and won&#x27;t ever buy another brand of perfume again. Only con is that it wears off quicker than other perfumes with alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> A m a z i n g! Smells divine. I love ittttt</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing. I love it. However I usually switch scents throughout the year because I tend to like this one in the summer and a more warm scent in the winter. Oddly when I switched back to it this last time I got a horrible rash on my chest where it was applied. I stopped using it and the rash went away but I am afraid to try it again... Still love the scent though so maybe I&#x27;ll just have to apply it in a less visible location.</li>
    <li> I AM OBSESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT! walked into JCpenney&#x27;s and got stopped by a Sephora Employee, being the coconut vanilla scent lover that i am, she reccommended Lavanilla Vanilla Cocnut, sprayed some on my wrist and, it lasted all through class that night, the scent was so sweet and lasting, you&#x27;d think i had sprayed it all over! but only on my wrist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! MY #1 PICK!!!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really smell much coconut.  But it is a very deep, warm, rich vanilla.  Very warm.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe it as a light scent.  It is deep.  I liked it.  It smells good after settling.</li>
    <li> Totally love this fragrance and that they are safe to spray on your skin. If you love coconut and vanilla, you will love wearing this fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this scent. It&#x27;s my signature scent. I love how light and clean the fragrant is. Very light coconut vanilla smell that has staying power. I will buy again. I&#x27;ve always loved the smell of vanilla coconut and the fact that this is a healthy brand name purchasing a no brainer. I wish I could sample some of the other lavanila scents to see if I&#x27;d be interested in any of them.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with Lavanila perfumes. The Vanilla Coconut is one of my favorites. It smells very sweet. It does not smell like tanning lotion like most coconut fragrances do. I find it does smell more vanilla than coconut but I do not mind. It also last all day. I apply it in the morning and I can still smell it on my wrist at the end of the day. I am also obsessed with the new Vanilla Lemon scent.</li>
    <li> I find this scent is always appropriate.  People are always wondering what smells so wonderful when I wear this.  I&#x27;ve been told I smell like cookies!</li>
    <li> Not really what I was looking for... More vanilla than coconut. Looking for a scent like B&amp;B&#x27;s Coconut Vanille.... haven&#x27;t been able to find anything like it!</li>
