      <li>but I truly love it.</li>
      <li>and I love using Blackout for my liner</li>
      <li>A better balance of matte, satin and shimmer would be preferred.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it more as winter comes along</li>
      <li>but I do love the highlighting shades.</li>
      <li>the more purple-ish tones were a lot more purple and</li>
      <li>better off buying it in sephora.</li>
      <li>Have seen many comparisons and am now just realizing it after re-looking through the reviews.</li>
      <li>The mirror isn&#x27;t a mirror at all, much more like a shiny piece of plastic.</li>
      <li>I love the Naked2 palette.</li>
      <li>better quality.</li>
      <li>I ordered it on Monday afternoon and it came in the mail 3 days later. :D</li>
      <li>and i was so Excited for it !</li>
      <li>Loved it so much.</li>
      <li>The brush that comes with it is great, very well made and easy to use and easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>the light goldish tones looked silver.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Naked palette for a while now, and this one is just as great.</li>
      <li>Accidentally got sent 2, both arrived separately on the same day, nice!</li>
      <li>I am used to getting most orders pretty quick</li>
      <li>It was 22$ when I bought it here (last week)  from a seller, so I figured prospects were good</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s super pigmented and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I love Urban Decay pallets, they are just great an last longing!</li>
      <li>I can really recommend the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was fine.</li>
      <li>I really liked the colors, but they fell sooo quickly, especially Y2K.</li>
      <li>so it was worth it.  </li>
      <li>This ISN&#x27;T worth it at all.</li>
      <li>then once it was in transit it was pretty quick.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s a nice matte black and easily smoked if that&#x27;s your preference.</li>
      <li>I use it on daily bases, and im in love with it.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for the real deal, this isn&#x27;t it!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really all I&#x27;ve been using since!  </li>
      <li>i used it for the first week and was suspious about the colors.</li>
      <li>If you want the real thing at least buy from someone else who may be more honest.</li>
      <li>it has the amazing &#x27;half baked&#x27;, a golden color that compliments any eye color.</li>
      <li>my roommate had the first Naked palette and I loved it so much I decided to buy the second.</li>
      <li>First off, the packaging seemed really off from what i had remember seeing in retail stores.  </li>
      <li>but really-</li>
      <li>I highly recomment this product and seller!</li>
      <li>all i really wanted was the eyeshadows.</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>then I want the real thing.</li>
      <li>I stopped by Ulta and checked out their UD Naked 2, and the colors were so different, and their shadows were so much creamier and much more pigmented.</li>
      <li>The brush is decent as well.  </li>
      <li>I was also pleasantly surprised at how fast it came.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not often you find a palettes that you like, combine both matte and shimmer, and use all the colors so this is a rare find and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for something like this, I&#x27;m usually pretty stingy!</li>
      <li>(great matte light cream colored base or highlight color) and Chopper (shimmery champagne color) are my favorites</li>
      <li>the color half baked was beautiful and just didnt match the half baked in the second one.</li>
      <li>my first naked palette i bought from sephora and</li>
      <li>sure enough not only was the packaging completely different, but the colors did not match!!  </li>
      <li>I was soooo excited when i got this is the mail and before date due.</li>
      <li>I really love the product and use it almost everyday!</li>
      <li>it came in a cardboard box instead of a clear plastic casing, the palette itself was all dented and the mirror looked like it was plastic.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for use in my professional makeup kit.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just so obvious that it is not the real thing.</li>
      <li>I want my money back to put on the real thing.</li>
      <li>Natural tones with some glam.  </li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;d have to say Bootycall</li>
      <li>If I am going to give this much money for urban decay</li>
      <li>The only complaint I have is that some of the colors are almost exactly the same color blended over the eye and there are too many shimmery (almost metalic) colors.</li>
      <li>Was so excited for this palette turned out to be a fake but the return of money was quick</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s expensive, but you&#x27;re better off going to Sephora and buying the real deal.</li>
      <li>Other than that, very please with what I got.</li>
      <li>First OMG i bought this product without lipgloss just saving a few bucks</li>
      <li>The colors are very pigmented and I have little to no fallout when applying.</li>

    <li> Whoever sent it to me it was in perfect condition. I really love the product and use it almost everyday!</li>
    <li> my roommate had the first Naked palette and I loved it so much I decided to buy the second. Found it for a great price here on amazon and was very impressed by the palette. it has the amazing &#x27;half baked&#x27;, a golden color that compliments any eye color. it&#x27;s super pigmented and stays on all day. i would recommend applying the shadow before you do other face makeup because it does get on your face when applying.</li>
    <li> This palette is simply amazing! I was so suprised I was able to find it at suck a great price even without the lip gloss! The product arrived faster than expected, unlike the last palette (same product) I had a friend order for my birthday which NEVER came. Aparently it was lost at the post office after the seller took it in to be shipped. I highly recomment this product and seller!</li>
    <li> Have had this palette for a couple weeks now and it&#x27;s really all I&#x27;ve been using since!  The brush that comes with it is great, very well made and easy to use and easy to clean.  The colors are very pigmented and I have little to no fallout when applying. I use a lid primer so I can&#x27;t comment otherwise but the colors last all day with no creasing. So far I&#x27;d have to say Bootycall (great matte light cream colored base or highlight color) and Chopper (shimmery champagne color) are my favorites and I love using Blackout for my liner, it&#x27;s a nice matte black and easily smoked if that&#x27;s your preference. It&#x27;s not often you find a palettes that you like, combine both matte and shimmer, and use all the colors so this is a rare find and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m willing to pay a little extra for something like this, I&#x27;m usually pretty stingy!</li>
    <li> I bought the Naked Palette for my daughter &amp; she loves it! I was hesitant to spend this amount on eye shadow but it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> I got this for $20, great deal!! Accidentally got sent 2, both arrived separately on the same day, nice! I really liked the colors, but they fell sooo quickly, especially Y2K. I stopped by Ulta and checked out their UD Naked 2, and the colors were so different, and their shadows were so much creamier and much more pigmented. Fake, fake, fake. Ah well, you get what you pay for. I still use it, but I load a ton of primer before I apply it.</li>
    <li> Loved it so much. The colors are sophisticated and leave a perfect finish. The makeup made ​​with Naked2 are beautiful. Recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love the Naked2 palette. I have used the Naked palette for a while now, and this one is just as great. It includes some brighter colors rather than the neutrals that Naked has.</li>
    <li> For the most part I am happy about the UD palette.  After reading the other comments I was worried about it being a fake- if it is, it&#x27;s pretty good! I appreciated that none were broken and if you peel the cover off the mirror that it is an actual mirror (as another buyer had commented on).  I think the seller should work on shipping times however:  I was given a time frame that I would be getting my purchase and I did get it before the last day as I was told I would however, it was in transit between the seller location and the mail distribution facility for over a week- then once it was in transit it was pretty quick.  I am used to getting most orders pretty quick so that was a little annoying- but really- we are getting Urban Decay for half the regular price- so it was worth it.  I would probably purchase more for the prices, but I hate waiting so long.</li>
    <li> This is a knock off. the eyeshadows are cheap and terrible. If I could give it 0 stars i would</li>
    <li> Was so excited for this palette turned out to be a fake but the return of money was quick so I give 2 stars.</li>
    <li> This is fake do not buy it the colors are off I compared to a friends palette she bought from sephora the colors are off, definitely a knock off.</li>
    <li> I am unsure where it told me that this would be used? A whole compact was missing, maybe that happened with shipping because it was very messy. Other than that, very please with what I got.</li>
    <li> I am using my husbands account. This is fake!!! Do not buy this!!! I ordered naked one from urban decay website and they were out of the Naked2 so I ordered this one!! Oh my it is so obvious that this thing is fake. The shadows were busted (some of them). The mirror is plastic and blurry. The container is bent. It&#x27;s just so obvious that it is not the real thing. If I am going to give this much money for urban decay then I want the real thing. Needless to say I SENT IT BACK!!! If you want this palette go to urban decay&#x27;s website and get it! Don&#x27;t waste your money on this junk!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for exactly what it is.  A nice neutral palette.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use it more as winter comes along but I do love the highlighting shades.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for use in my professional makeup kit.  The only complaint I have is that some of the colors are almost exactly the same color blended over the eye and there are too many shimmery (almost metalic) colors. A better balance of matte, satin and shimmer would be preferred.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m order naked2 palette and i was so Excited for it !&lt;br /&gt; but when i got it ,&lt;br /&gt; it was have a lot of defective!!!</li>
    <li> I was scared that once I got the product, I would be disappointed but I truly love it. I was also pleasantly surprised at how fast it came. I ordered it on Monday afternoon and it came in the mail 3 days later. :D</li>
    <li> This is definitely a fake Naked 2 pallette... The mirror was broken off as soon as I got it, the colors are all falling apart in their trays and mixing together, and it&#x27;s just a real s*** show of a product. I know it&#x27;s expensive, but you&#x27;re better off going to Sephora and buying the real deal.</li>
    <li> Amazing product... Naked 2 is a girl&#x27;s bff. I use it on daily bases, and im in love with it.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeshadow.  Natural tones with some glam.  Recommend primer though!  The brush is decent as well.  Good deals on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have seen many comparisons and am now just realizing it after re-looking through the reviews. Not 100% sure, but after looking at the two different ones, I feel mine might be fake. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> The colours are wonderful. I use it every day. The distribution was excellent. I can really recommend the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Everything was fine.</li>
    <li> I love Urban Decay pallets, they are just great an last longing! Collors are beautfull! I will get the holle colection!</li>
    <li> One of my friends had the Ulta one (from sephora) and recommended it to me. It was 22$ when I bought it here (last week)  from a seller, so I figured prospects were good it wouldn&#x27;t be real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got it in the mail and it is indeed fake as they come. The mirror isn&#x27;t a mirror at all, much more like a shiny piece of plastic. The plastic container it comes in is really hard to open and close and the plastic just feels junky. I haven&#x27;t decided if I am going to return it or keep it. If I keep it, I will update with how it works. If you are looking for the real deal, this isn&#x27;t it! If you are just looking for a similar color palette and trying to save a few bucks, hell why not! Eyeshadow isn&#x27;t a secret recipe!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Important I bought mine from one of the independent sellers!!!! Not from Amazon. If I return it I will likely be swapping it for this 40$ one that ships from amazon!!</li>
    <li> First OMG i bought this product without lipgloss just saving a few bucks all i really wanted was the eyeshadows. I was soooo excited when i got this is the mail and before date due. i used it for the first week and was suspious about the colors. my first naked palette i bought from sephora and the color half baked was beautiful and just didnt match the half baked in the second one. the case was falling apart mirror was horrible. FOUND OUT IT WAS FAKE was so pissed off!!! horrible palette ended buying from sephora. if your a urban decay junkie like me DONT buy this. better off buying it in sephora. NO STARS FOR THIS! horrible horrible!</li>
    <li> i purchase this item from Colony Gold expecting to receive the naked 2 palette with the brown tone array of colors.  once i received the package i noticed a few things....First off, the packaging seemed really off from what i had remember seeing in retail stores.  it came in a cardboard box instead of a clear plastic casing, the palette itself was all dented and the mirror looked like it was plastic.Then, i opened the palette and noticed that some of the colors looked nothing like i had remembered.....the more purple-ish tones were a lot more purple and the light goldish tones looked silver.  i took it over to Ulta the following day and held the products side by side...sure enough not only was the packaging completely different, but the colors did not match!!  this is 100% a fake product!!  do not buy from this seller unless you want fake makeup.</li>
    <li> For such an expensive product I would expect it to be much better..better quality. The mirror fell off when I opened the case!</li>
    <li> This palette from Trippl3lfashions is soooo fake. The whole thing is crap! The packaging (not even a real mirror), the shadows ( none are as pigmented as the real Urban Decay, some have excessive glitter that goes everywhere and some of the colors aren&#x27;t even close). If you want drugstore quality makeup please buy this fakeness. If you want the real thing at least buy from someone else who may be more honest. I want my money back to put on the real thing. This ISN&#x27;T worth it at all. They should have to tell you it&#x27;s a knock off. Jerks!</li>
