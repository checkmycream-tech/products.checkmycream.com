      <li>Good price for these, which are great if you get drowsy from dimenhydrinate (eg.</li>
      <li>They work just as good as prescription Antivert.</li>
      <li>It also works just as good</li>
      <li>good product, would recommend this to my friends.</li>
      <li>The value of this is exceptional.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Very good and at the right price.</li>
      <li>They are a phenomenal pill to take with you when you cruise.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>I think they taste like most chewable pills.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re better priced and work well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found these online.  </li>
      <li>take 2 at about 30 minutes before travel and it lasts most of the day.</li>
      <li>This stuff is chewable, takes ok and works well - without the drowsiness I fell on Dramamine.</li>
      <li>Plus this product and Bonine are much better, than Dramimine.  </li>
      <li>I was able to buy these in store before but, for some reason, they&#x27;ve disappeared from the shelves.  </li>
      <li>Product was as expected and service was excellent.</li>
      <li>I am not a user to this medication, but my mother is and I have to admit this medication have been real good to her among other meclizine medication.  </li>
      <li>Great for inner ear, balance and so many drug stores have to order.</li>
      <li>Chewable form makes it easy to take wherever you are.  </li>
      <li>One pill worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If I take this 2x/day, routinely when I know I may experience motion sickness (car, plane, train, boat, etc.), it works fine.</li>
      <li>but I gave some to a friend that said they worked fine</li>
      <li>This is a great buy as it&#x27;s the generic name for Antivert 25 mg and available without a prescription.</li>
      <li>It is way more economical than buying it in the stores around here.</li>
      <li>I avoided cruising for the longest time, but decided to give it a try to let my wife enjoy an experience at sea.</li>
      <li>While it&#x27;s much more effective to take these prior to motion, I gave one to him after he already vomited, and he started feeling better in about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Great product with limited amount of drowsiness.</li>
      <li>I also like that I only have to take 2 pills and they&#x27;re good for 24 hours instead of Dramamine which requires dosing throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Other than that this product is great and affordable.</li>
      <li>Fast acting, convenient, and a great value.</li>
      <li>and she quickly gave me two Travel Sickness pills and told me to chew them up.</li>
      <li>While dimenhydrinate is effective for motion sickness, it makes you very drowsy, and as a result, it often makes people (including me) even more dizzy and nauseous before it actually starts to work.</li>
      <li>I suffer from Vertigo and this product helps calm my stomach</li>
      <li>100 pills is a lot for someone who uses these only on cruises, but for the price and the convenience of free home delivery, it seemed okay to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now whenever I&#x27;m on a similar trip I pass these tablets out like candy, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of people comment on how effective they were.</li>
      <li>Product works good, however, these are chewable tablets not pills as expected.</li>
      <li>Believe you me, it works and it works very fast.  </li>
      <li>My family of five went on a cruise for the first time and I am so thankful I packed this medication.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This was the first time I used chewable tablets.</li>
      <li>But it does work for me, even on some pretty rocky cruises.</li>
      <li>However, the active ingredient in these Rugby pills is MECLIZINE, which is just as effective yet doesn&#x27;t cause any of those side effects.</li>
      <li>While Dramamine now makes a &amp;#34;Less-Drowsy&amp;#34; formula using Meclizine, I&#x27;ll probably stick with these Rugby pills since the taste of Dramamine still kind of grosses me out even after all these years, not to mention the Rugby tablets are significantly cheaper and come in 100 packs (convenient for long trips, and for sharing with the nauseous-looking traveler sitting next to you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although I can&#x27;t speak to how reputable or consistent each manufacturer is in their contents and quality control, I figure meclizine is meclizine, and it doesn&#x27;t really matter which brand you buy as long as you can get it in a quantity and at a price that suits you.</li>
      <li>if I forget to take it an hour before, I can chew it slightly and hold it under my tongue to dissolve and the medication will get into my blood stream much more quickly.  </li>
      <li>This size certainly saves over the package of 8 in the name brand version.</li>
      <li>I had intense vertigo for awhile</li>
      <li>the taste didn&#x27;t really bother me too much.</li>
      <li>These work very well.</li>
      <li>I have not had any side effects and no drowsiness which is unusual for me.</li>
      <li>Really works</li>
      <li>My doctor says these work very well and are NOT required to be chewed.</li>
      <li>I got very sleepy using this.</li>
      <li>It allowed me to enjoy the Disney and universal parks in my 2 week vacation.  </li>
      <li>Much cheaper than the prescription for Meclizne.</li>
      <li>Very embarrassing since I was attending a patient.</li>
      <li>I can no longer use Scopolamine patches due to side effects and Meclizine has turned out to be an even better option for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For a long time the only thing widely available was the DIMENHYDRINATE (Dramamine Original Formula).</li>
      <li>Seems to stave off my vertigo attacks pretty well, so far.</li>
      <li>Sure Dramamine is a long time trusted name/brand, but if you car travel with your family as much as I do, eight tablets for every one is not enough.</li>
      <li>This is a reorder - highly recommend you try it.</li>
      <li>My husband frequently gets vertigo and after his prescription was up, we ordered these and they work very well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad at first but for me, having to chew them everyday becomes a challenge.</li>
      <li>This is exactly the same ingredient in Bonine.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic buy for 100 tabs at less then $10.00.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like the chemical taste of chewable tablets, but these are so small that you don&#x27;t have to tolerate much of a flavor--and you can swallow it whole if you really want to and then chase it with water when you get the chance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gotten motion sickness my whole life, and not just on the occasional 7-loop roller coaster.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works very well and the taste is not too horrible</li>
    <li> This is exactly the same ingredient in Bonine.  This is generic Bonine.  For anyone who ever deals with seasickness, vertigo, air or car sicnkess, this is the only product to buy.  Get 100 tablets for less than regular package of Bonine.  Plus this product and Bonine are much better, than Dramimine.  I had intense vertigo for awhile and this was the &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; recommendation from the Doctors.  Really works</li>
    <li> . Best thing you can buy for motion sickness or vertigo. I have inner ear problems &amp; could not handle it without these. They work just as good as prescription Antivert.</li>
    <li> After reading other reviews on this item an carefully checked the the ingredients from Bonine is the same.I decided to order it. Follow&lt;br /&gt;instructions and tried it for deep sea fishing,Not once but twice using another friend as to test it out. It just doesn&#x27;t work. I got holy&lt;br /&gt;hell from my wife..she got her friend to try. Walgreens charge $10.00 for Bonine  &amp;#34;number one recommended brand&amp;#34; 16 tablets.I get&lt;br /&gt;100 tablets from Rugby&#x27;s Travel Sickness for $9.00 What a deal!!!! NOT!!! You get what you pay for!! She toss the rest of the pills&lt;br /&gt;(90 plus) over the ocean.</li>
    <li> Wife loves the availability!</li>
    <li> I had a bad case of Vertigo recently and my ear doctor recommended this medication.  Believe you me, it works and it works very fast.  If you have trouble with Meniere&#x27;s Disease you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
    <li> Great bargain. Product as described</li>
    <li> My family of five went on a cruise for the first time and I am so thankful I packed this medication.  Everyone too a pill a day and no one ended up motion sick!  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy as it&#x27;s the generic name for Antivert 25 mg and available without a prescription.</li>
    <li> good product, would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very good and at the right price. Helps with my vertigo</li>
    <li> Did cause a little drowsiness.</li>
    <li> This works great. I was a little skeptical given how cheap it is compared to how expensive name brand alternatives are but I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this product. it&#x27;s chewable, but you can also just swallow it like a normal pill and avoid the icky artificial sweetener sugar flavor. Drowsiness is a potential side effect but personally, I have not experienced this.</li>
    <li> Great product with limited amount of drowsiness. I suffer from Vertigo and this product helps calm my stomach</li>
    <li> I get vertigo and dizziness with my migraines and I also get it due to fluid in my ears from my allergies. This works! It is way more economical than buying it in the stores around here. I like that it is chewable. I don&#x27;t like the taste, but I don&#x27;t hate it. Chalky orange, aftertaste is minimal. You can swallow them if you don&#x27;t want to chew them. Chewing them makes them work quicker and is helpful if you don&#x27;t have any water on hand.</li>
    <li> Just like Bonine! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the only travel medication I can take that works. I hope the never stop making it. This is the best travel medication, I no longer get motion sickness.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly for me on cruises. I avoided cruising for the longest time, but decided to give it a try to let my wife enjoy an experience at sea. I works great. On our last cruise, in January, I started out taking 2 pills each morning. After a few days, and after having had success with these pills on 4 previous cruises, I decided to cut it down to 1 pill each morning. One pill worked fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These pills are simply a generic drug called meclizine. You can get them under all sorts of fancy brand names, including Dramamine Anti-Drowsy Formula, or you can get them under any number of store brands, from CVS to Kirkland, or under non-fancy brand names like this one, Rugby. Although I can&#x27;t speak to how reputable or consistent each manufacturer is in their contents and quality control, I figure meclizine is meclizine, and it doesn&#x27;t really matter which brand you buy as long as you can get it in a quantity and at a price that suits you. 100 pills is a lot for someone who uses these only on cruises, but for the price and the convenience of free home delivery, it seemed okay to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I used chewable tablets. I don&#x27;t really like the chemical taste of chewable tablets, but these are so small that you don&#x27;t have to tolerate much of a flavor--and you can swallow it whole if you really want to and then chase it with water when you get the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing: I do find I get drowsy with meclizine, though not when I&#x27;m on the go. If I take it at, say, 8am, I find I need a nap in late afternoon. When we&#x27;re in port and touring around actively, I don&#x27;t feel drowsy at all, regardless of whether I&#x27;ve taken one pill (25mg) or two pills (50mg). Just something to keep in mind as you plan your day. Plus, everyone&#x27;s different. But it does work for me, even on some pretty rocky cruises.</li>
    <li> Great stuff- I get pretty motion sick and I&#x27;ve been using it like crazy. Doesn&#x27;t make me drowsy like everything else does!!!</li>
    <li> Works well - actually tells a little less artificial than the brand name product so that was a plus!</li>
    <li> This was such a great deal compared to the tiny bottles of 6 or at most 10 you buy at the stores, same active ingredient, and it works just as well as the expensive tiny bottles of pills!</li>
    <li> I cruise a lot, I use these pills once in the morning and one at night time and I never get seasick. They are a phenomenal pill to take with you when you cruise.</li>
    <li> I got 100 tablets for what it would have cost me for 16 at the pharmacy.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> My wife gets motion sick very ez ... these work well for her.  This is a reorder - highly recommend you try it.</li>
    <li> Good price for these, which are great if you get drowsy from dimenhydrinate (eg. Dramamine) like I do. They arrived promptly and are perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten motion sickness my whole life, and not just on the occasional 7-loop roller coaster. Even a relatively short car ride with a lot of stop and go traffic will get me (though I never get sick if I&#x27;m the driver, which I hear is common with a lot of people). Needless to say I&#x27;ve tried a lot of motion sickness aids over the years, and I&#x27;m so annoyed that I didn&#x27;t find this stuff sooner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long time the only thing widely available was the DIMENHYDRINATE (Dramamine Original Formula). While dimenhydrinate is effective for motion sickness, it makes you very drowsy, and as a result, it often makes people (including me) even more dizzy and nauseous before it actually starts to work. However, the active ingredient in these Rugby pills is MECLIZINE, which is just as effective yet doesn&#x27;t cause any of those side effects. While Dramamine now makes a &amp;#34;Less-Drowsy&amp;#34; formula using Meclizine, I&#x27;ll probably stick with these Rugby pills since the taste of Dramamine still kind of grosses me out even after all these years, not to mention the Rugby tablets are significantly cheaper and come in 100 packs (convenient for long trips, and for sharing with the nauseous-looking traveler sitting next to you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took 2 of these on a recent 4-hour bus ride through the mountains of Peru, and while the guy next to me got extremely car sick (for the first time in his life, he said), I was completely fine. While it&#x27;s much more effective to take these prior to motion, I gave one to him after he already vomited, and he started feeling better in about 20 minutes. Now whenever I&#x27;m on a similar trip I pass these tablets out like candy, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of people comment on how effective they were.</li>
    <li> I was able to buy these in store before but, for some reason, they&#x27;ve disappeared from the shelves.  I&#x27;m glad I found these online.  They&#x27;re better priced and work well.  They obviously taste bad, but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
    <li> A lot cheaper than other name brand motion sickness meds, but these specifically made me a bit woozy and didn&#x27;t work as well as name brand Dramamine Less Drowsy.</li>
    <li> They do not have to be chewed.  My doctor says these work very well and are NOT required to be chewed.</li>
    <li> Stuff works great and is inexpensive.  Tried buying almost the same item (different brand) from large Pharmacy chain and they wanted over $50! This stuff is chewable, takes ok and works well - without the drowsiness I fell on Dramamine. And it&#x27;s the same price for 10x the pills - so if you&#x27;re prone to motion sickness, this product is great.  However, try to take 30 minutes BEFORE any activity that may make you nauseated.  Once I&#x27;m sick, it doesn&#x27;t work as well to tamp it down for me and I have to take stronger prescription medications.  If I take this 2x/day, routinely when I know I may experience motion sickness (car, plane, train, boat, etc.), it works fine.</li>
    <li> Wife been using for years.  Hard to find at times.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and this might be specific to myself; I took 1 pill and slept for nearly 26 hours, it made me THAT drowsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also gave me an upset stomach and horrible taste in my mouth for that entire time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this was just s fluke, but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per my vertigo - it didnt seem to affect that at all either.</li>
    <li> Love this product hope you never run out!!!!!!</li>
    <li> best deal going! at walgreens if I got the prescription it would by 200.00 dollars.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful product, price, delivery and service. Great for inner ear, balance and so many drug stores have to order. 2 days with Amazon Prime#</li>
    <li> Worked for me.  Same ingredients as the more expensive name brand motion sickness products.</li>
    <li> Worked well during a long trip from the U.S. through Europe and back. Nice that they are chewable - no complaints about the bad flavor that I get about the usual swallowable kind.</li>
    <li> The first day I started my EMT job I threw up in the back of the ambulance due to motion sickness. Very embarrassing since I was attending a patient. I realized I needed a way to control it if I was too continue my career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a reputable brand, it worked but it was too expensive to use everyday. Then I came across this. It also works just as good and it was a lot less expensive! It was a lifesaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only minor drawback is the taste. It&#x27;s sweetened but with a noticeable &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; flavor. It&#x27;s not bad at first but for me, having to chew them everyday becomes a challenge. Other than that this product is great and affordable. Have been buying them for 3 years and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This product is exceptional! I usually use Bonine but as soon as I get on a roller coaster or simulation ride, I feel it working and I always get a bad headache. This product was great and I didn&#x27;t feel thing. It allowed me to enjoy the Disney and universal parks in my 2 week vacation.  I also didn&#x27;t have the drowsy feeling.</li>
    <li> Take the pill(s) BEFORE you begin feel sick, and it works wonders. If I am flying on a morning flight, I take 2 the night before and 1 the morning. If I am on a trip that involves various methods of transportation on a daily basis (trains, boats, etc) or a theme park vacation, I take 1 each night and another one each morning. That way it&#x27;s always in my system as a precaution.  Meclizine does make me feel just slightly woozy, but never drowsy or impaired. I can no longer use Scopolamine patches due to side effects and Meclizine has turned out to be an even better option for me.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years.  Being chewable they are especially easy and convenient and work well.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST for any motion sickness.  Not only is it non-drowsy, but you don&#x27;t need water to take it.  I like that if I forget to take it an hour before, I can chew it slightly and hold it under my tongue to dissolve and the medication will get into my blood stream much more quickly.  I also like that I only have to take 2 pills and they&#x27;re good for 24 hours instead of Dramamine which requires dosing throughout the day.  I won&#x27;t travel or dive without these little pills.</li>
    <li> Always a help to our sealess legged friends.</li>
    <li> I get dizziness with migraines but can&#x27;t take other medications because they make me sleepy.  Because of this, I can nip the dizziness in the bud, before it gets too bad.  So grateful!</li>
    <li> This product works so well . I will definitely purchase this product again for my next vacation.</li>
    <li> Love this! The chewables are great to take anywhere?</li>
    <li> Worked great for me. Last time I went deep sea fishing.. and it did not go well. This time I did not vomit at all. Great product.</li>
    <li> Got these to go on an Alaska cruise. 14 days, no seasick issues. Some rough seas, a wild ride in a water taxi, and a bumpy through a thunderstorm  plane ride home...all of this would have put me over the edge without this medicine. I took one in AM and one in PM starting the day before I began my trip. This size certainly saves over the package of 8 in the name brand version. And it did not make me drowsy at all. We enjoyed all the wonderful cruise ship food with no problems at all. Very grateful, as I am generally quite subject to car sickness, air sickness and sea sickness. I will never travel again without this.</li>
    <li> Great value!!  Much cheaper than buying a pharmacy package of Bonine and seemed to work just the same.  I did like that they were chewable and the taste didn&#x27;t really bother me too much.</li>
    <li> I had been having dizzy spells and would get so sick to my stomach I would lay in the floor and throw up. they eventually told me I carry water in my inner ears and it could turn into menieres disease. A friend happened to be with me one day when I was having a spell and she quickly gave me two Travel Sickness pills and told me to chew them up. I could not believe how fast I was feeling fine and no longer sick.</li>
    <li> I am not a user to this medication, but my mother is and I have to admit this medication have been real good to her among other meclizine medication.  Considering the cost and performance of this medication I can only say that this is a real bargain for your money.  Great medication!</li>
    <li> I am very susceptible to motion sickness; my husband usually isn&#x27;t. I took these during a recent cruise trip and had no problems. One particularly rough day at sea, my husband tried them and found they work well for him too. It&#x27;s much less expensive to buy a bottle of these than to buy the same medicine at the airport!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as non-drowsy brand-name Dramamine [meclizine].  Chewable form makes it easy to take wherever you are.  A much better value than paying $8 at the drugstore for some measly quantity!</li>
    <li> Seems to stave off my vertigo attacks pretty well, so far. Much cheaper than the prescription for Meclizne.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using these for years and they work great for her. As I understand it there are small &amp;#34;rocks&#x27; at the end of each inner ear hair. In my wife&#x27;s case some of these have came lose and rattle around in there causing here to feel dizzy and nauseas. Her doctor proscribed a medication but then told us that these work just as well for much less. These dissolve in your mouth and are stronger than the pills.</li>
    <li> Product was as expected and service was excellent.</li>
    <li> Great price for 100 pills of Meclizine.  I used to stop at a drug store before traveling and spend something like $5 on a few pills.  These are literally $.07 per pill.  What a deal and they work great!  I think they taste like most chewable pills.  Not great, but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I take 2 at about 30 minutes before travel and it lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> These work really well either before you get sick or will calm your stomach after you get sick.</li>
    <li> Product works good, however, these are chewable tablets not pills as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a Great product and will always keep it close by !</li>
    <li> Meclizine is the only thing that works for me with no side effects. I usually take Bonnie, which is the same active ingredient. I have not had any side effects and no drowsiness which is unusual for me.</li>
    <li> These work very well. My husband frequently gets vertigo and after his prescription was up, we ordered these and they work very well.</li>
    <li> Fast acting, convenient, and a great value.</li>
    <li> Perfect for air sickness. Take 1 24 hours before the flight and another about an hour before.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product is what you pay $7.00 dollars for at the pharmacy for 12 pills.  Fantastic buy for 100 tabs at less then $10.00.  Works well for motion sickness be it car, boat or airplane.</li>
    <li> These work just as good as the Dramamine tablets! And for the price value, it&#x27;s a bargain. Sure Dramamine is a long time trusted name/brand, but if you car travel with your family as much as I do, eight tablets for every one is not enough. An hour before we go on those lengthy car rides, we each take a Rugby and never have to worry about motion sickness, nausea, and/or pulling over to let some one throw up on the side of the road. One thing I recommend is that you eat something before taking -- it&#x27;s easier on the stomach.</li>
    <li> It did the job for a fraction of the price of Bonine!</li>
    <li> Works the best and is non drowsey.</li>
    <li> I have not used them but I gave some to a friend that said they worked fine</li>
    <li> The value of this is exceptional. They taste just like every other small disolvable tablet. Lol I this for about a tenth of the price on a cruise ship. Buy with confidence. However. I got very sleepy using this.</li>
