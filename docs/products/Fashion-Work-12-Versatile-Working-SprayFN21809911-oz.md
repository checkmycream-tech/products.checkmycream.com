      <li>Since the Windy City can mess up my hair immediately, I know that when I get out of the wind, I can just push or comb it back into place, and I&#x27;m happy for the rest of the day.</li>

      <li>don&#x27;t like hairsprays that leave my hair all crusty and hard and this fine mist leaves hair looking clean and manageable.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product since the one I used to use is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;I like a strong hold but without the sticky, hard, crunchy look and feel - she readily told me about this one.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the scent and fact that you can spray then style before finishing with spray.  I am still trying it out as far&lt;br /&gt;as hold goes - you really have to spray a lot to get a good hold on your hair.  I have ordered a stronger hold Redken&lt;br /&gt;product and will see how they compare.</li>
    <li> This product is not as nearly good as it use to be--- and yet, if I buy the same product in the black can, it&#x27;s like the old formula was! This is crazy!!!! Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m agreeing with \\&quot;Great BUT SOFT hold!\\&quot;...I too have fine hair, and although I want a style to hold I&#x27;m not interested in a wet spray that weighs my hair down and gives me \\&quot;helmet hair\\&quot;. This working spray is just what I need: with my hands or a comb I adjust my hair the way I want it, then spray it with #12, let it dry for 3 or 4 seconds then I push it around, then spray it again. Since the Windy City can mess up my hair immediately, I know that when I get out of the wind, I can just push or comb it back into place, and I&#x27;m happy for the rest of the day. NOTE: if you&#x27;ve got thicker, heavier hair, and want a really hard hold, this probably will not work for you.</li>
    <li> The nozzle stopped working. So I have almost a full bottle that I can&#x27;t use. Nozzles on other Redken hairsprays are much better.</li>
    <li> Love this hair spray its very versatile and does not clog hair. I tried Loreal which is highly recommended by other users and it made my hair look like mop next day. With Redken I can brush my hair straight through if I want too and my hair dont look dirty following day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite hairspray hands down!</li>
    <li> Not stiff. Flexible spray that holds the style. Love this spray!</li>
    <li> Use it all the time. Nothing else is the same. It holds without a lot of stickiness, no hardness, just a good working hair spray.</li>
    <li> Good hold without weighing down even spider-web-thin hair.</li>
    <li> good product but poor can/noozel design. some noozels fail to work @ onset voiding product use. I contacted co. re this several times and got no response.use at your own risks</li>
    <li> Works great for my curly girl hair.  I have always struggled with my Irish curls.  They look frizzy, dull, fall out in places, etc., etc.  All that until my hair dresser suggested Redken Fashion Work #12.  Now, my hair has never looked so great, so easily.  Seriously.  Fashion Work #12 has brought control to the curls.  Now they don&#x27;t fall out and yet are touchable and yet still workable.  And, as a bonus, very little to no of that hairspray build-up that can only be shampooed out.  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recipe for great curls.  One swirl of Redken Hardware#16 plus two pumps of Redken Curvaceous.  Mix well.  Adjust depending on amount of hair.  To apply, squish/scrunch into your curls, then dry. Air or blow dry.  Then scrunch out the crunches if you have any.  Spray with Redken Fashion Work#12.  Voila!  Smooth curls that stay curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t that what we&#x27;re looking for?  Curls that are actually smooth not frizzy ringlets?  That&#x27;s what I get with Redken Fashion Work #12.</li>
    <li> I love this when I really don&#x27;t want to mess with a palmade or a paste. Very easy to use, creates a gentle texture. This isn&#x27;t for extreme texture, but for a quick style, this works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Love the product as I have used it once before, but unfortunately something with the nozzle has gone bad partway into this can and I can&#x27;t seem to use the rest..  Was disappointed not sure I would get it again.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairspray of all time! And I am a beauty product enthusiast so I have tried alot of hairsprays and hands down the best! Great hold with out the stickiness or hardness of other sprays.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hairspray ever! Holds my fine hair, but doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or stiff! Allows a little movement, too. Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday spray to hold your style after a blowdry or flatiron. I only gave it 4 stars though because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold up very well to medium levels of humidity - I suppose I should give the Redken 28 spray a try for that! But otherwise, this spray is great. It has such a fantastic scent (so much so that it&#x27;s a struggle to actively NOT inhale when I spray because of course, that is bad for you) and leaves your hair soft, without any residue or stickiness. For those of you with fine hair - this does NOT make your hair greasy after a couple hours, which is a problem for me (I have extremely voluminous hair that is also fine, I don&#x27;t know how that makes sense but it&#x27;s true) so overall - great job Redken! This is going to be a staple in my hair care routine.</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle looked thinner than ones I have seen previously and did not work reliably.  One can failed to work on the first try and wound up in the trash.  Either Redken is peddling inferior goods or Redken and Amazon are failing to police distribution channels.  In any case, I won&#x27;t buy this product through Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Styles and holds without stiffness!</li>
    <li> great smell.  does not stick and hair feels very natural.</li>
    <li> Good product and got here as promised</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this product for several years and will continue to do so.  Very light but does the job.</li>
    <li> This product keeps the hair in place without making it feel glued on.  It doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue on the hair even with repeated use.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> I cannot LIVE without Redken working spray for my clients. Yes, it costs a pretty penny at full retail value when you consider how often I use this. But it takes mediocre updos and curls to FABULOUS. Don&#x27;t be afraid to use too much. There&#x27;s no such thing as too much. Unlike other working sprays, this does not flake, crust, or get yucky. My clients constantly rave about the smell of the product. IT doesn&#x27;t smell like typical &amp;#34;hairspray&amp;#34; in fact, it&#x27;s a little on the masculine side as opposed to a floral smell.&lt;br /&gt;Spray it on before you start working with the hair. If you&#x27;re shaping curls or you know that you&#x27;ll be working on an intricate up-do, don&#x27;t be afraid to use too much of this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other &amp;#34;working sprays&amp;#34; and they cannot compare.</li>
    <li> This product is great for all types of hair.  It helps control the frizzes on rainy days or just smooth.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it came broken already. Even though it was in a big box that seemed well protected, once I took the lid off the plastic part that you press down for the hairspray was broken. I was highly disappointed and their return policy stinks~</li>
    <li> I love love love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like hairsprays that leave my hair all crusty and hard and this fine mist leaves hair looking clean and manageable. style gets even better the more you spray. has a light hold but that&#x27;s what I like.</li>
    <li> I am a &amp;#34;loyal fan&amp;#34; of Redken products and am very happy with this hairspray.  It is light, and brush through!!&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped promptly and wrapped very securely as to avoid any damage.</li>
    <li> Redken 12 Hair Spray is perfect for fine thin hair.  It will hold your hair in place without weighing it down!  Love this Hair Spray!</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair spray for years and love how you want work the hair after spraying. So glad I can buy it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for 3 years.  No helmet head.  Very soft but keeps hair under control.</li>
    <li> I like using the Redken 12 hold spray when I am taming fly-aways or when I want a more natural look. Sometimes I don&#x27;t want to deal with stiff hair. When I need more volume and lift I like using Redken 18 hold.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser has been using this for several years, and I appreciate the fact that I can order it through Amazon.  The spray offers great hold without being too drying.</li>
    <li> The #12 I had was more of a spritz.  This #12 is a light hair spray and does not hold my hair at all.  I thought I was buying what I had, but obviously there are two #12&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This spray is great for my hair.  It&#x27;s a little lighter than the 16non-aerosol spray so I use this when the Houston humidity is really high.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hair as sticky.</li>
    <li> used it about four times, now it&#x27;s plugged up won&#x27;t spray.</li>
