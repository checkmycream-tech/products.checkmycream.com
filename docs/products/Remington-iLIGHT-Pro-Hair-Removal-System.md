<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> There is nothing permanent about this product. I use it daily just to maintain. Cartridges have gone up in price, I buy two approximately every two months. So around $350 a year for cartridges. For me it&#x27;s better than going in for hair removal treatments.</li>
    <li> Took forever to cover small area, used for 3 months and saw very little reduction in hair, still have to shave daily, fair skinned with dark hair</li>
    <li> I used this for four times and I lot of reduction in my hair growth, but cartridge runs out very quickly and this is a bad part.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I love this machine. It does take some getting use to in the beginning, but you get use to the pain. I did the lightest setting the first time but was able to handle it on the third setting the second time. I did it for the third time a couple days ago on the fourth setting. I am already seeing results. I have really thick hair as I am mexican and native american. I have fair brown skin. What ever you do, do not get remotely close to your tatttoo if you have any, it hurts and will damage your tattoo. I didn&#x27;t read that far in the instructions. Caused a blister and discolored the small part that I went over. I was able to get 3 uses out of one cartidge but I was able to do both full legs, bikini, and arms during each session. To replace the cartridge is super easy, I had no issues. It&#x27;s important that you keep your skin moisturized after treatments, it&#x27;s like having a mild sunburn, skin gets dry. I do a salt scrub after a few days exfoliate the skin. I haven&#x27;t had to shave once in over a month. I use to shave my legs every other day. Well worth the time and investment.</li>
    <li> Never really worked and boke right after the month warranty.  Complete waste of money.  Wish I had listened to other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Light asian skin + dark hair &#x3D;&#x3D;&amp;#62; WORKS! I have traditionally always used a epilator to remove unwanted underarm hair, but UGH, my hair grows so fast. If I&#x27;m being diligent, I need to epilate every 2-3 days to have clear underarms. Getting annoyed, I decided to give this IPL system a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin, there is a learning curve to using this thing. My first time using it, I was just kind of a mess and probably went over the same spots several times by accident. The next day, hair was growing back and I was totally disappointed for having spent so much money. But, I didn&#x27;t give up. To ensure that the thing was working, I shaved both pits but continued only IPL&#x27;ing one side for a more proper experiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s been several times (at least 4x) on the one side and 1x (my first messed up try) on my &amp;#34;control side&amp;#34;, and the results are in! The 4x+ IPL side&#x27;s hair has noticeably reduced! There is still hair growing there, b/c as you may know, hair grows at diff cycles, so I&#x27;m still probably zapping hairs that had a delayed growth cycle. Anyway, it&#x27;s definitely noticeably different on the two sides, so I&#x27;m very pleased and glad I kept at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t be discouraged if it&#x27;s unwieldy to use at first. As I said, learning curve. After a few times, you start getting the hang of using it. Key is to be methodical. Hold -&amp;#62; zap -&amp;#62; move down -&amp;#62; repeat. Never fully lift your hand as you&#x27;re holding the IPL b/c you&#x27;ll forget where you were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the highest setting. It is a little bit of pain, but really not that significant. I would recommend testing the highest setting and seeing if you can tolerate it. Better results, I would imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am next going to try this on my bikini area, but I admit I&#x27;m a little scared haha. I have only ever waxed, and well, waxing is pretty easy for me and has pretty good and longish-lasting results (1-2 weeks)... but then again, 3 months does beat out 2 weeks by a lot!</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results. I&#x27;ve been using for 3 weeks on level 4. I have the recommended skin and hair type for this machine. I read the instructions and watched the video. I&#x27;ll keep it up for a few more weeks and if no results then I think I&#x27;m going to stick with the waxing.</li>
    <li> Using this device is VERY SLOW AND TEDIOUS.  Does not appear to be very effective but perhaps it&#x27;s too soon for results to show.&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have used this as directed and have not gotten any results. Okay, maybe a [very] slight reduction in hair thickness. But that doesn&#x27;t make any difference to me- either I have to shave daily or I don&#x27;t. Well I still have to shave daily. For the record, I have very pale skin and the hair that I was treating is dark hair- so according to Remington, I&#x27;m the ideal candidate for this to work on. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have very course hair and yet it&#x27;s working. I feel like a new woman. Tip to give, it&#x27;s best to let the hair grow as much as you can stand it then shave and zap. Works best this way.</li>
    <li> I must admit that I bought this product fully expecting it not to work. I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of hair removal products and many simply do not produce the results they say. This however has actually reduced the hair very well with really not much aggravation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not very good at using it regularly, so it would probably work better if you did. However, even with my sporadic use it has really made a noticeable difference. I hate shaving my bikini area because I get ingrown hairs which is why I purchased this. But part of the process is to shave, so I figured I&#x27;d just have to deal with it. I would say that after about 3 uses (again not consistently spaced apart), I have at least a 60 - 70% reduction in hair growth. The hair that remains doesn&#x27;t cause me to get razor bumps when I shave, so the hair shaft must be weaker. Also, I haven&#x27;t had to buy a replacement head yet, so that will give you some idea of the amount I&#x27;ve used it and the given results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this and give feed back. I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the money. And the pain is tolerable, just adjust the settings. I&#x27;ve used it in very sensitive places and it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the results expected to the third time of using the product but is giving me positive results.</li>
    <li> I have to admit I thought that it would remove it completely fast but it takes a couple of flash sessions.  What I do want to mention is that the bulb does not last as many flashes as indicated. I used the first bulb for two sessions which considering the flashes it promises is 1000 it was not even to 250 each session. The bulb is like forty dollars if you purchase it through the company I purchased it through amazon for eighteen dollars with in all beats going to a nail salon every other week and paying so much more.  I can say that after the third session with the second bulb, I have seen that my hairs are not growing so much I hope after two more sessions that it doesn&#x27;t grow at all.  I will keep you posted.  So with that said I love the product.</li>
    <li> I have used it three times and already have very little growth. I love not having to shave daily. Love it!</li>
    <li> It pops you like a rubber band, and not sure it actually works all that well.  Only used for a couple months so far.  Only time will tell if this is worth the money.</li>
    <li> It works.  Labor intensive, but worth it.    The 4 Star was for the fact that the cord wiring wears out.  I have had mine for two years.  Now, the fan will stop unless I jiggle the cord.    TIP-Don&#x27;t wrap the cord around the holder in the base.  Causes stress on the cord.</li>
    <li> I went ahead and spent the money on the iLight, because I have very dark hair and have spent a fortune on waxing and shaving. I get very bad ingrown hairs that are awful after shaving or waxing. I did my bikini line 2 times on the 2nd setting. I must say I&#x27;m so surprised, there are areas where they hair is not growing back. JUST 2 TREATMENTS. I just did the 3rd treatment last night and I can&#x27;t wait to see how much more hair disappears. I decided to do my underarms since I had such great results with the bikini area. Legs are next for sure. This product works as well if not better than advertised. You will not be sorry and it is well worth the cost. Much cheaper than having it done professionally and saves a ton on waxing. Buy it that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before finally deciding to buy this unit. I read all the reviews on it. I really liked the fact that the reviews are mostly positive and I really liked the price. I ordered it from Amazon and I received it yesterday and watched the video and read the little booklet on it before trying it out on a small test area. It is really easy to use. I am hoping it works. Unfortunately today when I went to use it it wasn&#x27;t working so I called customer service. It pleasantly shocked me when a real live person answered the phone instead of dealing with an automated robotic menu and being put on hold. The customer service woman helped me to check the unit and see what the problem was. She determined I had a faulty unit. She was so very nice and helpful. They are sending a shipping label so I can return it and receive a new one. I understand that sometimes a faulty unit can happen but their customer service is really wonderful about trying to help solve the problem. I can&#x27;t wait to receive a working unit after shipping this one back and I will update to let you know how it works.</li>
    <li> Do I still have hair growing on my legs? YES. Did it remove hair from my legs? Maybe. Yes, there are a few places where it seems that hair will never grow back again. I don&#x27;t know if that is a good thing. This product is very expensive and for the price (I didn&#x27;t pay for it) I would hope for a more impressive system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do know that electrolysis is a lot more expensive so this may work for people with fine light hair more than it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before buying this IPL. I think it&#x27;s the best option considering price and cost of replacement cartridges. Also, it&#x27;s very important to me that it can be used worldwide in terms of voltage, not just US voltage, so I can still use it when I move.&lt;br /&gt;Now, as for ease of use, this couldn&#x27;t be easier and it&#x27;s very fast. I sit in front of the TV and in 15 min or less I&#x27;m done. In terms of pain it does hurt a little in some sensitive areas but much less than laser and for most of the process it&#x27;s pain free for me even in the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is because in terms of effectiveness I didn&#x27;t find it to work exactly as claimed. If the description hadn&#x27;t aimed so far I would have given it a 5 because in terms of hair reduction I&#x27;m very happy with the results. I have used it for 2 months, carefully following instructions, and I have seen a considerable reduction in the frequency of times I have to shave, but still very far from the 3-6 hair free months promised. For example, instead of having to shave my legs every couple of days now I have to shave once every two weeks or once every week if I want them really smooth. I think this is a pretty good result and if they had promised me this I would have still bought this item so I&#x27;m happy and would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, just don&#x27;t expect too much and know also that in some body areas like the arms not even laser can remove hair completely for long.&lt;br /&gt;I big plus also is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin even in the highest setting. I had some bad reactions to laser before but this didn&#x27;t even cause redness.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product and if you buy it, be aware that it will reduce hair growth but is not miraculous.</li>
    <li> Update 4/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife decided to use it about six months ago when I quit. She has had good results with it.  With her good results, I decided to use it again too. I assume her positive results depend on her hair type. Her hair is thinner than mine, thus \\&quot;maybe\\&quot; easier to zap???, thus kill the roots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if this is a permanent solution, but she use to have ingrown problems while epilating. The zapping has eliminated this problem, thus based on that alone, she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product probably deserves two stars, because it does some-what work, but I figure people looking to buy this product will skim past the two star reviews and read the one star reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this in December through a Groupon promotion for $199.00 and not on Amazon. I have read the reviews here for four months before posting. I basically agree with one poster MrD that some of these reviews (Ama***123, which happens to be the very first review) are fake, but most reviews are just from people who have not used this product long enough to give a good review. People need to use this product for a few months, not a few weeks or first or second session before posting,  where their enthusiasm is clouding their judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it works, if it didn&#x27;t Remington would be sued. You will probably see 30% hair reduction after 3 sessions. Overall, maybe 40% to 50% reduction after a dozen or so sessions. The hair will start to grow back in probably a few weeks, not six months. The hair is just stunned, thus you will see the hair follicle on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to ask yourself, what are you saving? If you shave, you will still have to continue to shave. 40% reduction for a few weeks will still leave you shaving daily. Is this worth the $250.00 price tag and $25.00 bulbs that seem to burn out at a few hundred pulses (not 1500 pulses and I am on my second bulb bought through Amazon.)? You decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people who epilate, stay with epilating, the results are much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who want permanent hair removal, go to a professional, it will be financially cheaper in the long run; especially when you are paying $100.00 a year for bulb replacements on a system that only give temporary results. Groupon always has 50% off professional laser treatment coupons.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product religiously for 7 months now. At first, I was VERY excited about the results. But reviewing this laser soon after purchase would be inaccurate at best. Here is why: You DO see great results after the first 2-3 treatments. Namely, not all the hair grows back. However, after 9-12 treatments, these results don&#x27;t change drastically, and you will still have quite a bit of hair that requires shaving.  In other words, you still must shave AS OFTEN as you did before, and it takes just as long as before to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, though I have less hair on my legs, the hair that does still grow on my legs requires shaving just as often as before. The fact that it&#x27;s in patches or there is less of it doesn&#x27;t make it OK to be seen in public with hairy legs! This device requires an inaordinate amount of time and quite a bit of $$. While I&#x27;ll keep using it since I can&#x27;t return it, I would NOT have bought it had I known it would produce such limited results.</li>
    <li> I am surprised that this item is only showing a 3.5 star average. The iLight is a great product. I have had pretty good results. I have gone through two cartridges since I have had my iLight. I did underarms, bikini, and lower legs. It took some of my hair longer to fall out than what is stated, but it does work. I had hairs coming out well after two weeks post treatment after my last treatment. I had some little tiny remnants that just hadn&#x27;t come out, so they looked like black dots. I decided to pull at them with tweezers. They were way smaller than 1 millimeter (about the depth of a dime, very tiny). I have noticeably less hair, and my legs have almost none. Maybe about 20 hairs each? Not bad. My underarms have not been so lucky, but I believe that this is because I epilated about a month before receiving my machine and this hair growth phase hadn&#x27;t yet become active.  I am debating on whether to try and do touch ups in that area or whether to epilate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the iffy.....The cartridges need work. As I mentioned before, I have used two cartridges. The first one came with the machine. I used it just over twice, and it gave out. I am 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and my legs are not very large, so I couldn&#x27;t have used that many pulses. I already had one on backup for just such an occurrence as I had heard that the cartridge that comes with the machine did not last as long as replacements. I got just under two treatments with the replacement cartridge. Please fix this Remington! This is an overall good product, but I can see how some people were put off by the quick failure of the cartridge.</li>
    <li> Laser hair removal is temporary. Lets say it one more time together, &#x27;Laser hair removal is temporary.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said every penny I have ever spent on it I&#x27;ve never regretted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent over $2,500 on salon laser hair removal (about two years of treatments, once every 8 weeks) and by the end of it I was hairless, nearly 100%, and anything that did grow was so fine and pale you couldn&#x27;t even notice it. After about a year without it some darker stuff started to grow back, nothing like I used to have at all, but some stuff so I bought this as a touch-up to what I had already had done and it really feels about as intense as the machines that the pro&#x27;s were using on me. I even tried it on some areas that I had never treated before and I&#x27;m really happy with the results. You have to do it every two weeks but beyond that this guy is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this really is a steal - I can&#x27;t believe some reviewers are complaining about the price (of the device or the bulbs) - do a quick Google search for salon laser hair removal and trust me you&#x27;ll come back to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go on. I&#x27;ll wait here.</li>
    <li> I just received my product and I purchased it mainly for my face until I read that it was not cleared In the US to use on face or neck. I am so annoyed by this because I was really excited to start treatments. So I packed it up and shipped it back. I did however try it on my feet just to get a feel of it and it seemed pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, my question is has anyone used this product on facial hair and is it safe to do so?? If not, can someone recommend good laser suitable for the face please?!?!!</li>
    <li> This review is based on my wife&#x27;s feedback.  She was very excited to review this product as she had just been researching and pricing professional laser treatment at the time this was sent.  She&#x27;s now been using this product every couple weeks for many months on some \\&quot;select areas\\&quot;.  She stated that the hair does seem fall out and it works but after all this time it doesn&#x27;t grow back any thinner or different than before.  The hair takes longer to return than shaving and it&#x27;s not as painful as waxing but it&#x27;s not the definitive answer to hair removal that she had hoped for.  Once the device needs a new cartridge, I suspect it will be sentenced to a life on the closet shelf and it will be back to the razor.  I guess a company like Remington wouldn&#x27;t be in business too long if they actually stopped hair growth.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased the I-Light Pro and I intend to use it on one area, while I will have professional laser hair removal done professionals on another area.I am currently undergoing 6 professional treatments of laser hair removal. I have done 2 so far. The I-Light package states that the I-Light is good for \\&quot;6 months\\&quot; of hair removal, whereas the the salon guarantees their work for 2 years... so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars, because so far the I-Light has the same \\&quot;sensation\\&quot; as the professional laser treatment - however, I am using a higher setting (#4) on the I-Light, while I&#x27;m still at a very \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting when at the professionals. I do have a high pain tolerance, so neither one really hurts. It&#x27;s a quick pinch when the light zaps.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still shaving both areas, but have noticed that the hair density of both areas is going down. However, both areas still get a few ingrown hairs/bumps. It&#x27;s a long process, but I hope to update this review in a few weeks with some results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;5 months later: I&#x27;m changing my reviews to 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been to a professional for laser removal for 5 of my 6 package sessions so far. I&#x27;ve been having one area done by the professionals and one area using the I-Light at home.  Not even half of my hair is gone in the area being professional treated, even though they said when I prepaid for my sessions it should only take 3 sessions to start seeing a reduction in the hair. There are no guarantees, but I understood that going in. The professionally treated area has made the hair grow in finer and less coarse, but it&#x27;s still there and you can still see it. And I still have to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have seen absolutely NO reduction in the area I&#x27;ve been using the I-Light Pro on. I have been using it on the highest setting, which does give a bit of a &#x27;zap/sting&#x27; that makes you think it&#x27;s working, but I have seen no change in my hair quantity or thickness. I&#x27;m light skinned, dark hair, soI should be a perfect candidate... but it seems neither one is working for me!</li>
    <li> OK, but does not do as good of a job as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> Pretty much sucks.... It takes like 2 cartridges to get lighter/thinner hair growth. Even after the hair gets barely thinner/lighter it grown back in 4days... Shaving is cheaper. The only difference I noticed is some hair grows slower than other hairs so it looks/feels smoother it&#x27;s not worth the money. I&#x27;m white with medium Brown hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used it twice but, I can say from those two experiences that I really it.</li>
    <li> Returned this item because there were too many safety restrictions....and limited uses per the instructions.</li>
    <li> Works great, Cut down my shaving time from every day to every 3 days just after two uses, but....light cartridge went out after second time. Time involved to use product isn&#x27;t too bad about 20 minutes a leg.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for more than 2 years and have been very happy with my Remington I-Light Pro. I have white skin and thick, dark brown hair. I originally purchased this to remove hair from my bikini area. Before owning this IPL, I would get bikini waxes at salons from time to time. I have really sensitive skin and shaving that area would result in bumps and inflamed skin. The bikini waxes were expensive, long, painful, uncomfortable sharing this intimate grooming experience with a stranger, and the results only lasted a few weeks. I wanted a hair removal system that would last longer than a few weeks and that is why I invested in the I-Light Pro. For me, the I-Light has been fabulous. The first time I used it, it was quite painful. However, it was no worse than a bikini wax. At first I used it on the lightest setting, but soon increased it to the strongest setting. You get much better results with the strongest setting. In the beginning, I would get some bumps a few days later. After a few uses, this got much better. For me, the I-Light did not completely remove hair for 6 months. Rather, it greatly reduces and thins the hair. Each time I use it, less hair grows back. And the more I use it, the less painful it is. Now that I have been using it for more than two years, it is nearly painless, even on the strongest setting (which I always use). Oh and how long does a cartridge last? Mine just expired after more than two years of zaps. I was zapping between one and two times a month. There was a period where I skipped more than a month of using the I-Light and a lot of my hair grew back. When I went back to using it again, it was a bit painful like it had been in the beginning. I think the reason that my hair starts growing back a few weeks later is because I have very thick, coarse, and stubborn hair. My guess is that if your hair is on the thinner side, your zaps will last longer. Even so, I am thrilled with my I-Light Pro. It takes two minutes every twoweeks and I am good to go. I recently started using it on my underarms and am pleased with the results. Again, it doesn&#x27;t completely remove the hair, but it significantly reduces it. If you are  looking for a better way to reduce and remove body hair, I highly recommend the I-Light Pro!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. I always say that she takes to long in the shower. She say, I got to shave and it takes time. She told me it takes about a month to work and she is really happy with it. From a mans point of view, cut shower time in half and its already paid for itself in water bill. :-) She is 17 and Italian enough said. Any questions will be past to my daughter. Great gift for the lady in your life.</li>
    <li> This really works on any dark hair, but I never read where if you have blonde, grey or light hair it would not work until I received it. Also not for use on face. After only 2 uses I saw results. So in all, a GREAT product!</li>
    <li> Update 5/5/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third replacement cartridge.  I&#x27;ve noticed more hair grows since I&#x27;m not as aggressive as I was with using this early on.  I&#x27;ve been using this maybe twice in three weeks.  There are spots that get streaks of hair that grows normally but I&#x27;ve let it grow long enough to know that it is way less than the volume of hair I would have naturally.  Shaving to use this is the worst part, honestly, but that&#x27;s not really a fault of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside of this is that this product makes hair removal almost worth the bother.  Considering my track record with ingrown hairs there are certain areas I could never shave every day.  My skin would be destroyed by all the ingrown hair bumps and scars if I tried.  The fact that this products stops a lot of hair from growing really makes a difference in bothering to shave at all.  Still happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/23/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten halfway lax with using this.  If I slack off for a week or two I have a light smattering of hair that is thin and barely grows and a few streaks of hair growing at a relatively normal rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second replacement cartridge is now about to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need to shave but I have so much less growing hair now.  The replacement cartridge thing is a bit of a pain, having lasted me like two months, but overall I&#x27;m still pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/4/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this maybe once since the last review but allowed some time to pass.  I really have to update my clearance percentage.  I&#x27;d say 95% of the hair is not growing now.  At least 80% has fallen out.  I&#x27;ve started taking not having hair there for granted.  Isn&#x27;t that what you want, I guess?  I think it&#x27;s time to move on to a new spot.  I&#x27;m really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/21/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this roughly twice a week since starting my review, maybe 9 times now.  My first cartridge gave out at the beginning of my 9th treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m maybe 70-80% clear of growing hair.  There are a couple stubborn spots plus a smattering of a few hairs here and there that weren&#x27;t affected.  Later passes seem to catch the scattered hairs but the stubborn spots are resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt this will ever entirely eliminate the need to shave but it still makes the area look much better after you do shave.  It&#x27;s a lot less dark and speckly in the area.  It also keeps a smoother feel, overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...it&#x27;s working!  I&#x27;ve only used this thing three times and about 40% of the area seems to have hair that&#x27;s fallen out or is at least stunted.  I have almond-shaded skin (like the inside of an almond, for the spots that don&#x27;t get sun, so pretty light) and dark brown to black hair (it&#x27;s pretty much pitch black if it doesn&#x27;t get any sun).  I did all three treatments within two weeks rather than two weeks in between.  The actual flash window is small, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if you&#x27;ve covered everything.  So even though the two week wait is probably to catch some of your hair follicles in a different growth period, I repeated much sooner just to have a better chance of having covered everything.  I didn&#x27;t burn myself or anything.  Everything looks and feels fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Pull you skin as taut as possible if you&#x27;re treating an area that&#x27;s squishy or has folds (armpits, etc.).  You&#x27;ll be surprised how much surface area there actually is to cover but the point is that the root of your hair will be much more visible through your skin if you pull it tight, hence it&#x27;s easier for the flash to get to it.  I noticed that hair that comes out diagonally from my skin has been affected sooner than that which grows almost straight out.  I assume a greater length of root is shallow in the skin, therefore more easily affected by the flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is actually kind of fun.  It hurts something like a cross between getting snapped with a rubber band and touching a light bulb sometimes but it&#x27;s something that lasts a second, so it&#x27;s halfway amusing, even.  This isn&#x27;t like an &amp;#34;I touched a hot waffle iron with my bare hands&amp;#34; kind of burn that&#x27;s going to ache for days.  At worst this has given me a pink spot of two that has been completely gone within hours and that was probably due to me double-flashing by mistake.  However this is diminishing fast, a lot of it probably having to do with me having less hair in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second Tip: If you have to shave a spot that doesn&#x27;t like to be shaved in order to use this thing, maybe apply a skin product with  Propylene Glycol (I assume I can&#x27;t name brand names) and facial moisturizer after you&#x27;ve shaved and flashed the area.  Shave cross-wise, not against the direction of your hair.  Don&#x27;t leave too much stubble, though, that&#x27;s when it really hurts when you use this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand this product is not going to eliminate my hair 100% but even my current reduction of 5 o&#x27;clock shadow already makes the area look so much better.  So far, I&#x27;m pleased.  I may update on how far my hair reduction actually goes.d of burn that&#x27;s going to ache for days.

    <li> I purchased this a little over a year ago.  I had paid the big bucks for laser treatments on my under arms and bikini, but was unable to finish them do to the money.  I decided to try this product. I have been very impressed.  I am done with my under arms and almost with my bikini area and decided to use it on my legs.  It is really working. I haven&#x27;t been very good at doing it every three weeks, I really think if I did I would be done already.  My hair is very dark brown and my skin tone is light to medium.  I used to have to shave my legs everyday, now I can go about 10 days without really needing too.  The hair that is left is very thin and lighter color.  I have a few areas that are totally bare.  Very happy I decided to try this product.  It has been worth it.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> As a female, there are certain places where one does not want hair.  I&#x27;ve debated about using different products.  For the price, this product seems to be doing everything it claims.  After about four weeks the hair isn&#x27;t growing back.  Be sure to follow the instructions.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work on my wife&#x27;s dark skin</li>
    <li> works great!!&lt;br /&gt;Ive been spending too much $$$ and times for my hair remove at the skincare shop.&lt;br /&gt;NOW, no hassle for making an appointment everytime, and super easy to do myself!!&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after reading many favorable reviews. After receiving the I-Light Pro, I read through the directions and decided to try it out. It took about an hour to do my lower legs, underarms and bikini line. Product was fairly simple to use and after the first couple pulses it moved along quickly. I was able to use full-strength on all areas with only minor discomfort. I did forget about a tattoo I have on my ankle while I was zapping away and it did burn. I tried the tattoo again on lowest level and while still painful, it didn&#x27;t blister. I think I will just avoid that area from now on.&lt;br /&gt;  I don&#x27;t have any results yet, but look forward to seeing some in the next few weeks. I will try to update this after my next session.&lt;br /&gt;  I am giving this 5 stars to start since, so far, the product is exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/24/2012&lt;br /&gt;I just completed my second session on my lower legs, bikini line and underarms. I was about 20 flashes from completing my last section when the bulb died. Fortunately, I had ordered a replacement when I bought the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: So far I noticed some hairs falling out in my bikini line during the past week. My legs are on the hairy side and require daily shaving in the summer so I think I would need to lose alot of hairs for results to be noticeable there. I am really hoping to see some improvement in the next couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in January and have used it every two weeks for a total of 5 times now. I am the ideal candidate with somewhat fair skin and dark hair.  I have a lot of hair and it grows very fast, so I&#x27;ve shaved my legs every day for the past 35 years.  That&#x27;s a lot of shaving!  My hair is not completely gone, but I would say at least 3/4 of it is and what little remains is much finer and softer.  I&#x27;ve only replaced the bulb once, using it on both legs, underarms and even the top of my toes, which takes me about 20 minutes.  I use it on the highest setting and only in the most sensitive areas (behind the knees), does it hurt just a bit.  I&#x27;m encouraged that if I keep doing this, eventually I won&#x27;t have to shave at all.  I&#x27;m very happy with this item, it&#x27;s well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve used this a few more times over the summer and fall for a total of 11 months now.  I would say my leg, underarm and bikini hair is 90% gone.  And better yet, the hair follicle shadows are fading too.  The hair that is left is very soft, and I no longer have to shave daily anymore.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this device!  I just completed my second treatment cycle yesterday but I will say that after one treatment I had definitely noticed less growth.  Of course, I have only used it in spot areas that I normally trim.  The i-Light is extremely easy to use and quite painless although I only used it on the lowest setting.  I do think that it&#x27;s important to shave or trim as close as possible because it seems more painful if the area has more hair.  I think this product is perfect for the guys too.  I will still trim areas but it&#x27;s ingenious for the spot treatments!  Buy it for your man!!!</li>
    <li> I am extremely skeptical about products such as these, but I was desperate to find a solution. I can honestly say that afer three full body treatments I have truly experienced a difference. The majority of the hair in the treated areas has not regrown and the hair that has is extremely fine.  I am very optomistic about the end results. To anyone who considering purchasing this product, it is worth it.  The price is extremely reasonable, it actually does what it says it will, and the results last!  My only advice would be to have an extra cartridge on hand at all times because you never know when it will die out, and be patient because you definately don&#x27;t see results overnight.</li>
    <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t try this at all. I watched the DVD, and it terrified me. I was worried that my skin was too dark, and since you can&#x27;t use it on your face I had no use for it. If it hadn&#x27;t been from Vine, I&#x27;d have sent it back. I did give it to a friend, but I don&#x27;t know if they tried it or not.</li>
    <li> I bought this to treat my underarms and bikini area because I&#x27;m tired of the constant battle with razor burn and ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;m a prime candidate with very fair skin and dark hair.  So far, I&#x27;ve completed 4 treatments over a span of 5 weeks (I got a little impatient towards the end and did not wait the full 2 weeks between.)  I did all treatments on the highest setting, 5.  It has now been 3 weeks since the last treatment, and here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness - I&#x27;m seeing about 30% less hair in my underarms, and at most, about 10% less in bikini area.  Not the results I was hoping for!  Looks like this is going to take several more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain - Hardly any at all!  Just a brief flash of heat.  My skin was not red or irritated afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use - VERY easy and surprisingly quick.  Took me about 5 minutes total to treat both underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality - Here is my biggest concern.  The first machine I had stopped working after about 20 pulses.  All indicator lights green, just not flashing.  I called support and had them send me a couple new cartridges, only to end up with the same problem.  Finally figured out it was the machine itself that was defective, and called support to trade it in for a new one. (The process took about a week, since I had to ship the old one to them first.  They provided the shipping label.)  The new machine appears to work fine; however during my last treatment, the sensor that is supposed to beep when in contact with your skin inexplicably stopped working.  I had to restart the machine a couple times before it began working again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up:  This product does work... eventually.  And perhaps not fully.  Depends how long you want to spend treating and re-treating the same areas.  At the current rate, it will take the whole summer before I am \\&quot;hairless\\&quot; in the areas I want.  And based on my experience and several other reviews here, I suspect my machine or cartridge will crap out on me before that point.  Remington has a fantastic concept with the I-Light Pro; they just have some major work to do on improving their quality control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** (a couple months later):  I am changing my review from a 3-star to 1-star.  After half a dozen more treatments on my underarms, bikini area, and lower legs, I&#x27;ve found that it&#x27;s simply not having any effect.  There were a few hairs it zapped in the beginning (mostly in the underarms) but now they have come back in again, and the other hairs continue to resist treatment.  No wonder I hardly feel any pain.  BOTTOM LINE... the I-Light Pro is nowhere near strong enough to compete with professional treatments and is certainly not worth the $250 I wasted on it.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this item. It is supposed to give 1500 laser \\&quot;shots\\&quot;, but our unit packed it in after about 15 minutes of use. Customer service then informed us that the unit is not approved for use in my country and should never have been shipped. Avoid!</li>
    <li> This does the trick.  It just takes time like everything else.  Totally smooth under my arms now, and very smooth legs and bikini area.</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enough experience about laser treatments. I am thinking to buy and IPL home laser. I researched a lot. I have a question if someone can answer I will be glad. I can&#x27;t find speed and wavelength information of Remington i-LIGHT Pro Intense Pulsed Light. For example SenseEpil wavelength is475-1200nm and speed 1pulse every 3.5seconds 1.7cm2/sec. As far as I know based on this, remover machine price are changing. And I will decide based on price and this features.</li>
    <li> I want to start by stating I am no expert on hair removal methods.  However, I have struggled with them for YEARS!  I have spent 1,000&#x27;s of dollars in the process.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive razors, shaving creams, tweezing, professional &amp; at home waxing, epilators, electric shavers, depilatories, inhibitors, etc.  I have also purchased the Personal Laser Diode Hair Remover System for $200 AND been to a professional laser hair removal center.  NONE of which have given me hairless results.  It may seem as though I&#x27;m obsessed with hair removal.  However, I have VERY dark, VERY coarse hair in places a woman does not want hair.  The different methods I&#x27;ve used have been painful, embarrassing, and a complete waste of time &amp; money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to start with that because I know I&#x27;m not alone.  A lot of women out there are experiencing the same thing and its holding them back from doing things they love such as swimming!  What a process it is to prepare for a bathing suit when you have all this unwanted hair, unsightly razor bumps, ingrown hairs, stubble, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words cannot even begin to express how happy I am with this machine!  I was very leery of buying it.  I&#x27;ve already spent so much money on products that have not followed through.  After reading the reviews and becoming even more frustrated with my hair growth, I decided to purchase this.  I tried not to get my hopes up too much for this product...but boy was I wrong!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first time and wasn&#x27;t quite sold...I guess my impatience had me expecting the hair to fall out within the first few days.  After the first week I was in complete awe!  The hair had fallen out almost completely and I had an immediate boost in confidence!  I&#x27;m still in awe feeling that this is too good to be true (but it isn&#x27;t...it really is true!!!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been through professional laser treatments and I can tell you, this machine doesn&#x27;t even produce 1/8 of the pain I experienced there (Don&#x27;t let that fool you though, it does the job!).  After I had left the treatment center, I had redness, puffiness, tenderness, ingrown hairs, etc.  This machine doesn&#x27;t produce any of that...it only leaves you with smooth, hairless skin!  I recommend using the highest setting as soon as you&#x27;re able to tolerate it.  I feel the machine is more effective on the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is an OUTSTANDING product...I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my results!  I&#x27;m going out to buy a new bathing suit now to celebrate a hair-free lifestyle!!! :D  Thank you so much for inventing this product!</li>
    <li> I have trouble shaving it makes me break out.  I purchased the unit and im AMAZED how well it works.  It took a little longer than i thought but this unit works wonders after about 2 months and 3 treatments the hair is gone!!!  VERY HAPPY!!!  doctorjdavis@yahoo.com (so u know this is real !)</li>
    <li> It Hurts even on the back. Total waste of money.  I&#x27;m throwing this in the garbage.  Don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove my underarm and bikini line hair. I&#x27;m 47 and over the years, my under arm hair, which used to look terrific after I shaved, is starting to get a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow effect. Yuck. My bikini line has ALWAYS been a battle as I have hair growth about 2 inched beyond the edge of my underwear and swimsuit. Again, yuck. I want to be confident wearing a sleeveless top. I want to put on a swimsuit anytime and not wonder what the condition of my bikini line is. Laser hair removal is expensive and I just don&#x27;t have $500-$1000 and time for repeated office visits to take care of my issues. Thankfully, I found the I-Light Pro.&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped quickly (LOVE AMAZON!). It comes with an instruction booklet and DVD. It&#x27;s soooo easy to use. Had it ready to go right away and did both my problem areas in less than 5 minutes. If the head isn&#x27;t positioned correctly, it won&#x27;t work. You get used to hearing the beep that says its ready to go or press a little firmer/reposition it to get the contact correct. As far as any discomfort, at worst it was a 4 out of 10 on the highest setting. My underarms and the bikini area that faces front were completely painless. The only place where it was a bit sensitive was in between my legs. There, it was only a couple of times that it got my attention. Never did I want to stop or adjust the power level.( I wanted the highest setting to do the best job possible.) The \\&quot;pain\\&quot; I felt for 2 seconds is NOTHING compared to waxing. I&#x27;m so happy to know I&#x27;ll NEVER feel the pain of waxing again. I work at a spa and can have the most wonderful gals do my waxing and it still HURTS...not anymore. I didn&#x27;t even take a pain reliever before I started.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review in a few months to let you all know how its working. I&#x27;m completely confident in its ease of use and MINIMAL discomfort. So far, COMPLETELY satisfied.</li>
    <li> I just received the Remington iLight Pro, and used it for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;The machine doesn&#x27;t look too fancy. It&#x27;s small and lightweight and the plastic that it&#x27;s made of doesn&#x27;t seam very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are very simple, the machine is very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I was very skeptical that such a small machine would be able to penetrate deep enough and with enough power into my skin to reach and burn the hair to it&#x27;s root.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I actually used the machine it felt like it was burning and it left red marks! I even smelled the burned hair smell which indicated that it&#x27;s working!&lt;br /&gt;I like that I can repeat this every two weeks, so I am planning to use it every two weeks for as long as I have any hair in unwanted places.&lt;br /&gt;I do not expect this to permanently remove all my hair in 3 sessions that is absurd because even the professional treatments don&#x27;t have those kind of results. But if I use this every two weeks , I expect to have very little hair regrowth which is better then shaving or plucking.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to use setting 5 if you don&#x27;t test that area of the skin on the skin sensor you might burn. This machine is very powerful!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It took me about 30 minutes to cover both lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I highly recommend this device because you can buy new cartridges for only 24 dollars, you can spot treat unwanted hair if you have already went to professional laser treatments and have hairs only in some areas, it&#x27;s less expensive then going to a spa, it saves time, you can repeat every two weeks, you can zap single hairs on body, and it has a 2 year warranty in case it stops working. Good luck I hope my review helped.</li>
    <li> I have used the Remington Ilight Pro for two months - done four treatments. I have seen and felt a noticeable difference!  Mostly, I notice that the skin on my legs is really smooth. I still get hair follicles that grow \\&quot;through\\&quot; - however, I don&#x27;t have to shave as often, it&#x27;s quicker when I do shave, and my skin feels super baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend it. Now, I have dark hair on my legs, but only moderate growth. So, it might work well for the dark hair relative to light skin. The lighter hairs above my knees don&#x27;t seem to be disappearing as quickly. Though that hair is much more dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes less than 40 minutes to do legs, underarms, and bikini line. I can watch a TV show while using the system. It doesn&#x27;t hurt me at all on the minor setting and on the strongest setting, it feels like a little pinch. Nothing brutal and I can always turn it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am considering sharing the system with my family. We can all use it - because it only takes monthly updates, it&#x27;s easy enough to pass around. Several of my friends have done other laser hair removal - professionally. At least one has had full regrowth in four years. Others have not yet had regrowth. Buy it. Worth the money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it three times since it warns not to use it over once every two weeks.  At this rate - if it works at all, it will take forever.</li>
    <li> I ordered this a little over a month ago and started soon after.  When I went to do the 3rd treatment, the bulb only lasted a couple minutes.  I do think I see some results from the initial treatments, but I&#x27;m not so sure I&#x27;m going to be continuing.  I fear if I buy one bulb I&#x27;ll have to worry it might not last, so I&#x27;ll always need a spare around just in case.  It&#x27;s kind of frustrating because I see this problem with the bulbs popping up for a lot of people.  Is this really so hard to fix?  So even though I might get some results out of it(I&#x27;m not expecting miracles just reduction), do I really want to deal with this hassle, and worrying about faulty bulbs?</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington I Light pro 6 weeks ago based on a lot of research (and reviews.)  This one consistently seemed to be the biggest bang for the buck so I bought it knowing that if it worked well I&#x27;d be investing in several more cartridges.  I&#x27;ve done my lower legs, bikini area and underarms 3 times and my bulb has not failed me yet and I haven&#x27;t counted exactly how many times I&#x27;ve clicked that little button but according to my calculations it&#x27;s well over 1000 so I&#x27;m pleased. I am fair skinned and dark haired so I am the perfect candidate and I used it on the highest setting every time and the pain was way better than waxing so I was happy.  That being said after 1 treatment I saw amazing results on my bikini area and little to no results on my legs and underarms.  Now after the second treatment I noticed good results on my legs (more by touch then sight- even my hubby noticed :-) and minimal results on my underarms. I am not necessarily convinced that this is killing the root yet but that remains to be seen. I think it&#x27;s important not to expect professional results.  They can put professional in the name all they want but you&#x27;re paying hundreds if not thousands less than professional treatments so take it for what it is.  A reasonably price hair removal system that&#x27;s not messy, not that uncomfortable, not too expensive, not that time consuming and seems to work pretty good over time. I will update this as I see more results.  (And YES- I&#x27;m a real person who bought this thing without any kickbacks from Remington.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I think it may work better if you let it linger after it flashes for a second.  It feels different when I do that which leads me to believe that helps.  Plus it may reduce wear and tear on the bulb.  I made sure to give mine breaks and I never got that overheat warning.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to avoid the ongoing expense and trouble of waxing.  The results have been great.  Thinner hair, and less hair where I am using it, and I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the bulb after two treatments to legs/underarm/bikini line as other reviewers report.  It is not painful, like a rubber band snap for a second when it flashes sometimes (but not always) and I got used to it quickly.  Not much difference for me between the settings so I am using it on the highest level most of the time to get best results.  I have very sensitive skin (think red for 24 hours after a wax) but have seen no irritation or discomfort after the initial flash with this product on the highest setting.  Really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini line: OK results so far.  I switched from waxing to shaving to use this so I think the results will be slower for me here as it will take time for the hair follicles to regrow so I can treat them.  On the plus side, the treatments have been miraculous for ingrown hairs, a relief as I thought this would get worse with moving to shaving.  Hair seems thinner and more sparse.  It will take more treatments in this area because it&#x27;s harder to follow the grid pattern which means missed spots.  I think even if the hair removal results don&#x27;t meet expectations I&#x27;d want to have this around to treat ingrown hairs if I go back to waxing.  It seemed to hit some existing ones that were beneath the skin surface and make them go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarms:  great results.  Noticeable less hair and I only needed to shave once last week.  I exercise daily in sleeveless tops and was shaving every other day before.  I really don&#x27;t see stubble now for days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs:  good results.  It&#x27;s a larger area and I tend to do this last, get tired, widen my grid and miss spots.  But hair is thinner and sparser already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two negatives:  the handle is a bit awkward to hold and push down the button, and the pulses could be more frequent to move more quickly, particularlyover legs/larger areas, and as I got used to using it I could go quicker.  Perhaps an option to adjust the frequency would be nice, like windshield wipers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering a replacement bulb as I think I will hit 1500 pulses at next treatment and this is working well.</li>
    <li> After plugging in the unit and a very brief warm-up, you have to scan the body area to be treated for the unit to determine if the hair is light enough.  This can be awkward, depending on what part of the body you&#x27;re going to treat.  Once this is done, the unit is very simple to operate.  Place the head of the unit on the area to be treated, close one&#x27;s eyes, and push the button.  A very bright flash of light can be seen through closed eyes, along with a popping sound, and a mild burning sensation...which is the hair apparently being killed (feels like burned) to the base of the root.  I did not care for the sensation.  The manual indicates that at least two treatments are required to see much effect, and that the hair would gradually lessen in thickness/density.  I did not get to the second treatment.  Maybe others have a higher pain tolerance than I do.  The process is slow and tedious, and it&#x27;s difficult to tell which areas have been treated.  Sunglasses recommended.</li>
    <li> I received this product in the beginning of March 2012.  I am on my third session.  After two sessions, I noticed the hair is re-growing slowly and becoming more like peach fuzz.  I am giving this product 4 stars because it is difficult to determine where you zapped; this leads to a lot of overlapping.  Also, you can&#x27;t use this product in sensitive areas e.g. private areas of your body.  I will provide another update in May, but so far, I am pleased with the item&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
    <li> ***UPDATE***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having the Remington for quite awhile now, I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.  The TRIA is far superior.  I don&#x27;t even drag the Remington out anymore because it&#x27;s not worth the hassle.  If I could afford a new TRIA, I&#x27;d buy a new one, but I&#x27;m stuck with my Remington.  It does remove hair, but the results aren&#x27;t as long-lasting as with the TRIA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Remington 4 stars. I thought it might be helpful for some if I share my thoughts on Remington vs. Tria for those who are trying to decide between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Tria and I loved it.  I bought it slightly used--big mistake.  It died 9 months after the manufacture date, and since I wasn&#x27;t the original owner, the company wouldn&#x27;t help me, even though I offered to pay to have the battery replaced.  So, it&#x27;s now useless.  I knew I needed a new device, but I was annoyed with how Tria treated me that I decided to switch brands altogether.  The only alternative I found was the Remington I-Light Pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington isn&#x27;t exactly a laser, but uses \\&quot;ProPulse\\&quot; technology.  The Tria is marketed as a true laser hair removal system.  Tria promises permanent removal/reduction, while Remington claims results will last 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington has a retro look, which I don&#x27;t care for.  I liked Tria&#x27;s sleek, modern look, plus the fact that it was cordless.  On the other hand, I won&#x27;t experience the dead battery problems with my Remington, since the Remington is corded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The window (the part where the light flashes) is about twice the size as that of Tria, which means with the Remington I can finish an area in about half the time it took with Tria.  This is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington has a counter that keeps track of how many pulses you&#x27;ve used, so you&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s getting close to time to replace the cartridge.  Tria didn&#x27;t have a counter and there was nothing to replace; when it died, it died.  The counter on my Remington doesn&#x27;t work, but I don&#x27;t care because I&#x27;m not used to having one anyway.  I like feeling like I have some way to keep the Remington operational by way of replacing the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both devices have 5 intensity levels, so nothing new there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One annoyance with the Remington is that the flash is very bright, like a camera flash.  I did my legs this morning and I felt like I should have been wearing protective eye wear.  This was never a problem with the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington has a button you have to hold down to get the light to pulse.  Tria would pulse on contact--no button.  I have small hands and it&#x27;s awkward for me to hold this button down, and my hand hurt by the time I was finished.  Tria definitely wins out on this point, and if I could change one thing about the Remington, this would be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also dislike how difficult it is to reach the on/off switch on the Remington, but if it keeps my 6-year-old from switching it on accidentally, I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tria&#x27;s cool-down system was bothersome, as it would switch on and off during use and cause the laser to be sluggish.  Remington&#x27;s fan stays on constantly and there&#x27;s no drag, so that&#x27;s much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tria had a separate skin-tone checking device, whereas Remington&#x27;s is built in and awkward to use.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, since I just always put my hand on it instead of the body part I actually intend to treat.  (I&#x27;m breaking the rules, I know, but what was Remington thinking by designing the tester this way?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this when I get a better sense of my results, but I was already several months into my treatment with the Tria, and so I&#x27;m not starting with untreated hair.  My sense is that I&#x27;ll get as good or better results with the Remington.</li>
    <li> So I bought this product under the assumption that it would work directly out of the box. Wrong. I hooked it up, followed the manual to a &#x27;T&#x27;, and it never ever flashes. I unlocked the system just as it said and when holding down the flash button, nothing happens at all. No flash. I sent Remington an e-mail asking what I should do to fix the device but got no response from customer support. So, based on what was written in the manual, I decided to purchase a spare cartridge under the assumption that maybe the unit had shipped with a defective one. Another $30 wasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this. Quality control from China is non-existent. I basically have a $300 piece of plastic that I can&#x27;t return. Funny thing is, I would have settled for a replacement unit had they actually responded to my e-mail...</li>
    <li> This product does not work! Do not waste your money. I purchased this and used it as prescribed. I noticed a small thinning of hair in my arm pits but it had absolutely no affect on my arms and legs at all. The instructions say that it will take a month of weekly uses to start to see results. Of course by the time I realized that this was not working, after my month of use, the 30 day return period had conveniently ended. Now I am out almost $200.00. This product is a fraud!</li>
    <li> seeing dome result after 2 treatments already (legs, bikini and arm pit) but should make cartridge that last longer then 1500 pulse</li>
    <li> The instructions say to do 3 sessions, with 2 weeks in between, and then maintenance as needed. It took me 6 sessions, 2 weeks between each. It has been 2 weeks since my 6th session, and there is not a single hair on my bikini line. This is amazing. If you go to a spa, they usually make you wait 6 weeks between the 6 sessions. So rather than go to a spa, wait 30 weeks, and pay so much money, it only took me 10 weeks, and was way cheaper. I did 6 sessions on my bikini line, 6 on my underarms, and have done 3 on my lower legs so far and the original light cartridge is still working. I really didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, but it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since the 6th session, and the hair is starting to grow back, enough to be noticeable. Not so happy now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd update (2 weeks later): Hair is still growing back. Something is also wrong with the machine. I used to be able to use it on the highest setting, now even the lowest is unbearably painful, feels like I&#x27;m getting poked with a hot knife. I tried it in areas I have never done before, and it&#x27;s still unbearable, so I know my skin isn&#x27;t just sensitive from overuse. Can&#x27;t use it anymore, huge waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based off the good reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did! I have used  it on my underarms 3 times 2 weeks apart and I have an 85-90% reduction in hair growth. I have really pale skin and dark hair and I had really bad undergrowth but not anymore. I listened to the other reviewers and bought back up replacement cartidges. It has ran out of charges during my treatment but I just wait 5 min for the machine to cool down and replace the cartidge and I&#x27;m good to go! I have purchased 2 replacements so far. I also use it on my stomach area which is why I have used so many charges. I have noticed a difference on my stomach but have not had the same results as on my underarms, maybe because the hair texture is different? But I still have seen results (slower growth time, finer hair, &amp; maybe a 30% hair reduction) Overall I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> not as effective as a shaver and very time consuming. The cartridges don&#x27;t last as long and need to be bought often.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Love it and so easy to use. Yes you are not supposed to use on the face but I do and it is working perfectly alright. I bought it to use on my face exclusively and it is working great.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with the fact that the lamp that comes with the unit fails shortly after the first use. Based on other reviews i see that this happens to most buyers. I read one of the reviews where it says that i should e-mail customer service and they will replace it. HOWEVER, i e-mailed them twice and they would only reply back to me saying that i needed to contact them by phone and not by e-mail. My question is, why do you offer online support and reply to one of the reviewers that defective lamps will be replaced if you are going to tell me i should contact you over the phone and give me only excuses to not do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend a product that is not backed by a good customer service. Sorry.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I am of Italian descent and have the dark thick and plentiful hair to go with it. I used to shave daily and would start feeling the razor sharp stubble within hours. It definitely took some practice and it definitely took a few sessions ( a session meaning a 30 minute or so treatment every other week over six weeks) before noticing the lasting results. Read the manual and watch the DVD - you&#x27;ll be glad you did. The first treatment stung a bit, but after a few times I can crank that baby up to full power and it barely hurts (remember the first time you tweezed your eyebrows? Same sorta thing.) I&#x27;ve been using it about 18 months now and really happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says this on the box, in the description, etc. but it only works with  dark hair and lighter skin. The first time I tried it my legs were pretty tan and didn&#x27;t get as good results as parts of my body that don&#x27;t see the sun (abs, etc.) Subsequent treatments worked fantastic and I could shave 2x a week instead of daily and the regrowth was fine and soft - not hard stubble. Being able to shave while using this (in fact you have to use it on freshly shaved skin) is great - unlike waxing where I felt like a beast while it was growing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the results from the I-Light lasted 3-4 months until I started noticing not only the need to shave more frequently but also the regrowth starts getting thicker. But then I do another session and I&#x27;m good for another 3/4 months. But over time the hair on my thighs has barely come back and I am noticing the regrowth on my lower leg is 30-40% less than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So IF you follow the directions, and you fit the profile for being a good candidate for it (e.g. dark hair/light skin), and you realize this is not a permanent hair removal system and are ok with that - well worth the $$.</li>
    <li> First off, you cannot expect a device that costs under $200 to be comparable to professional laser treatment with a machine that costs thousands of dollars.  For the price, this is worth it, under certain conditions.    I have fair skin and very dark hair. This only worked (so far) on thick hair. I&#x27;ve been randomly using it for a couple of months.  I was able to \\&quot;permanently\\&quot; remove random thick hairs in places (like my big toes) and reduce the hair in my bikini area.  I have already had professional laser treatment there, but wanted to reduce some of what I had left untreated. I think using this on max is about as powerful as the first couple of low-level professional treatments at best. I used to have to shave my bikini area every day to avoid coarse stubble.  So far, after about four treatments (about a week or two apart), only some fine hair grows back.  This is okay since I need to go back to get a professional touch-up anyway (some fine hair is growing back in areas where I had professional treatment).  That way they can touch up the entire area at a high setting.  If it weren&#x27;t for me using this, they would have to do a low setting for the \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hairs and a higher setting for the previously treated areas. They might not be able to do that.  They would probably just do the whole area starting on the low setting.    I tried it on my legs, but am not sure it is working very well. One good indicator of that is that it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all when it flashes; so I&#x27;m not very optimistic. It does seem like it&#x27;s not growing as quickly and maybe it&#x27;s getting rid of the thicker hairs. I&#x27;m going to keep at it. I bought a couple of spare cartridges anyway. I had to, since the one that came with it was a dud. It lasted about 20 flashes. This is the only reason I knocked off a star. I didn&#x27;t want to bother with customer service; I probably could have gotten a replacement for free, but I just ordered it myself with Prime shipping in order to avoid the chance of having to wait.    So they way I figure it, I at least saved myself the cost of one or two professional treatments on the way to \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; removal as well as permanently (so far) removed coarse hairs in small areas that I would have never paid for professional treatment.  I&#x27;m going to keep at it with the finer hairs and if I get any results I will edit this review.    Also, you don&#x27;t need to buy eye protection for this.  It specifically says so in the directions. I still try not to look directly at it when it flashes.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS HAIR REMOVAL LASER EQUIPMENT AND IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. I ONLY USED IT ABOUT 5 ZAPS AND THEN IT WOULD NOT WORK ANYMORE. THE LIGHT BULB INDICATING TO CHANGE THE CARTRIDGE. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY SO DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. IT IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE IT BUT COME ON I DID NOT EVEN FINISH MY TREATMENT AND IT WON&#x27;T WORK ANYMORE.....</li>
    <li> I was a little nervous about using this at first... the whole \\&quot;working below the skin&#x27;s surface\\&quot; thing kind of freaked me out a bit. Looks like I had nothing to worry about! I&#x27;ve just done my second treatment, and I can definitely see that this system is working as it should. It&#x27;s pretty much painless, although you should make sure to shave well beforehand, as areas with more hair tend to be more uncomfortable. This hair removal system delivers what it promises.</li>
    <li> I love this hair remover. I originally used it for chin hairs which were becoming ingrown. It worked like a charm! I use it everywhere now. It takes more than 3 uses to get rid of hair but is still s great product.</li>
    <li> It works, but... It works best on fine sparse hair like the abdomen. Pubic and perianal not so well. I have light olive skin and fairly soft brown hair so I am a good candidate for the i-Light Pro. I spent a year faithfully doing a partial Brazilian every 2 weeks and I was able to remove about 65% permanently (or long term). I gave up and opted for laser treatments. Much easier and better results. Now i use the i-Light Pro for maintenance. It&#x27;s a perfect solution. Also, the coarser and thicker the hair the worse it hurts. As you destroy the hair follicles the pain gets less and less each time you use the product.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it .. very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 4 times now, over the past 8 weeks, and I have not  seen any difference in the hair growth on my underarm area, neck, or upper leg.  I am very disappointed and am checking into sending it back for a refund.</li>
    <li> I was also disappointed at the short lived bulb life.  Remington promised 1,000-1,500, and it wasn&#x27;t even a couple hundred.  I emailed customer service and they told me to bring the device into their office 1,000 MILES AWAY.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  Before the bulb died, I was able to use it on my underarms 3 times, and have seen NO decrease in hair growth whatsoever, even though I am the perfect candidate.  Severely disappointed, and out 250 bucks.</li>
    <li> I have been watching this item before it was actually released on Amazon, and read pretty much every review coming in before deciding to buy this. I&#x27;ve tried a few other hair removal devices like NO NO! (waste of money!) and epilators, and nothing has been ideal for my bikini line. I can shave everywhere else, but my bikini line is prone to irritation and ingrown hairs, so I just want it gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used this device around the middle of February, and again 2 weeks later at the end of the month. I wanted to use it in preparation for a beach vacation. Well, I still had to shave over the vacation and it seemed to have little effect. Once home from the trip, I&#x27;ve basically left things alone to measure any progress. To my surprise, just in the last week or so, I&#x27;ve noticed many tiny hairs are just falling out! I think it took my follicles longer than most, but 3 to 4 weeks later, I&#x27;m experiencing what the device promised. So, naturally I am going to continue treatments in hopes of more hair killing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The criticism I have of the unit, like others mentioned, is I wish there were a way to mark your progress. I find that if I press hard enough, I get a temporary imprint on my skin of where I pulsed last - so that&#x27;s my current method. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing spots though. Overall, I&#x27;m optimistic and hoping for a (relatively) maintenance free bikini area by summer!</li>

    <li> Update 9/7/12&lt;br /&gt;Well its been past six months and I can say that this is not permeant! It does what it says, gets rid of hair for a few months, but all of it grows back, all of it.&lt;br /&gt;I think with what I know, I would have rather spent the money on profesional permanent hair removal. Just for the record again, all , every single hair has grown back. The product does do what it says and it does not say that it is permeant so I decided not to dock it any stars since it has done what it said. Im just disappointed all the hair grew back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/29/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the spots on my arm did I did are still hair free, so im having to shave my arms all the time so they don&#x27;t look strange. I haven&#x27;t done my chest in a few weeks and let that and my stomach grow out. I would say this is definitely reduction. But it hasn&#x27;t done as much as I originally thought. My stomach is still pretty hairy but the hair has been reduced. The test spot on my neck I did a few months ago is still hair free, and I did my neck a few times, and I now have spots the size of an pencil eraser with no hair, randomly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think for the face/neck, id recommend laser and not to mess with this device there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that tiny hairs are growing back (not as thick) in some areas that were hair free before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: This thing does what it says, hair reduction, but don&#x27;t expect permeant results. It does seem to make allot of hair grow in thinner, and some hair isn&#x27;t returning (so far). It would be nice if it was permeant, but its not.&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so for almost 3 month now. My chest is 80% hair free now. My stomach is 50%. I&#x27;m starting to use it in other places hoping for similar results. I am still on the orignal bulb, and I don&#x27;t know how many zaps im on now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a slow process to remove the hair completely. Its still pretty painful when the thing strobes, I don&#x27;t know why they say it would be pain free, the more concentrated the area with hairs the more painful it will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the hair hasn&#x27;t started growing back yet im pretty happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 5/27/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;I upgraded this to 5 stars because its super effective on my hair so far. I am hoping its permeant, but I won&#x27;t know until 6 months from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried zapping a area on my neck, to see what would happen. That area is hair free now, but it HURT! I&#x27;ve got a full beard worth of stubble and a small patch with no hair, even though the instructions do say not to use on the face. I am semi considering trying it, because I hate shaving my face (Im a male if you haven&#x27;t figured that out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of doing my arms and legs next. I mostly just wanted to do my chest and stomach, as I don&#x27;t like to be a woolly manath when swimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think im on the 5th or 6th week. I have some areas that are completely hairless except areas where the flash thing didn&#x27;t go. My stomach is still has quite a few hairs, but im working it down, I am seeing results after each time I do it. My chest is almost hair free. I&#x27;ve noticed I have this \\&quot;sunburnt\\&quot; burned feeling in my chest, where the hairs were, like a little bit inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im still on the orignal bulb and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the machine. Im kinda trying to figure out how some of you say you used the entire bulb your first 2 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/30/2012&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;First time use:&lt;br /&gt;I tried it level 1 -5 on a test patch of skin and waited 24 hours. No negative reactions or redness. The next day I did my chest and abs area at level 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1:&lt;br /&gt;All the hair grew back, no changes, felt disappointed at first and thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 2:&lt;br /&gt;I have spots where there is no hair growth. So it seems some of the hair has fallen out. I just shaved my chest and abs again, zapped them again. I&#x27;d say the hair thats gone is maybe 1/3 an inch of clear skin every where I zapped the thing. Some of the hair that was in the window when getting zapped grew back like nothing happened. The test patched that I tried levels 1-4, all grew back with no hair loss, the test patch i did level 5 had some hair missing. I did my entire chest and abs with level 5 the two weeks ago, and its missing some hair, which leads me to believe that I need to highest setting for any results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as pain, it does hurt a little bit. It kind of feels like a rubber band and an electrical shock hitting where the hair grows. The machine also has a fan in the hand piece that sounds like a computer fan when its running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know yet if this is permanent or just temporary. I&#x27;ve heard it just \\&quot;stuns\\&quot; the hair to some people saying the hair never grew back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/12/12&lt;br /&gt;Week 3/Week 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, im only using this on the highest setting, I wish it was a bit more powerful as to be sure its killing the hairs. So far, the places I&#x27;ve zapped, the \\&quot;window\\&quot; or \\&quot;area\\&quot; that was zapped, about 1/2 the hair grows back and the other half is gone. On my chest and stomach area, its still quite hairy, Its looking like this is going to take a long time before its completely hair free. About the pain from the hairs getting zapped. It hurts. I&#x27;ve found my self not wanting to use this because of the pain. But so far this device has been really effective in removing the hair in the areas im targeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the company would approve this for the face, I&#x27;ve noticed other IPL systems in europe are approved for using on the face. I don&#x27;t know if its just the flash and their worried about that, or if the light damages facial skins, I don&#x27;t know, but I would really like to try this on my face after seeing the results from my stomach and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am still using the orignal bulb. I don&#x27;t know how much life is left. When I use it I just go over a broad area, maybe like 15 zaps on my stomach and 10 on my chest, I can&#x27;t really see the hair after I shave it, so I kind of have to wait after I zap it and it falls out to see where I have hair left. Also I can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;ve zapped an area because this thing does leave any marks, and I don&#x27;t want to rezap an area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But over all this thing has been super effective on the hairs that have fallen out. I guess I would say when I zap an area, the hairs that fall out cover the area of a pencil eraser or two put together and then the rest of the area the hairs regrow. So, thats why I think it might take a while. Again I am not sure if the hair is stunned and will grow back or if its permeant. In the areas where it really hurts, and it smells like burned hair, I seem to have the largest results. In other areas, it just feels really warm with out the rubber band being snapped on my skin, and I don&#x27;t have any results in those areas. So far I am pretty happy with this device, even with its high cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep checking back here to read the reviews, and noticed quite a bit of people not happy with it, which does kind of worry me. But so far im happy with it, I did buy it expecting it to not really work, and so far it is, so I am happy with that.</li>
    <li> Well, I had a complete hair removal IPL treatments 2 years ago, and it significantly reduced my hairs (compared to how it was before), but for almost $3000! I have a white skin and used to have really thick/dark hairs compared to my skin color, and getting rid of them was an absolute pain and waste of time with all those damn blasters and under-skin hairs after shaving or waxing! I had tried every possible way and hair-removal products but nothing worked better that those IPL treatments. However, everybody knows that nobody guarantees a permanent hair removal even with IPL or laser, so my hairs re-grew to some extent after almost 1.5 years, but I did not want to spend another thousands bucks to redo hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;  I was really surprised when I saw this home-version IPL online. I went over the reviews and found that this little thing works but not probably as quite well as professional hair removal instruments. So I thought however it works it is still worth $250 for a more convenient hair removal \\&quot;self\\&quot;-treatment (honestly, I was not comfortable at all when I needed to expose some personal areas of my body like my bikini lines to a hair removal technician). I took the chance and purchased it, and I can confidentially say that it was one of the best decisions and purchases I ever made. :) Yes it works. What is better than a flexible almost-permanent self-hair removal? I even tried it on some areas of my face and under chin with the lower energies (with special care to my eyes), and it did the job :). I saw obvious results after the second treatment, (it could have been the first but since I was new to it I decided not to go for higher energies at the first time). You just need to have patience and one hour or so (depending on the treatment area) every 2-3 weeks. And then just see how your hairs start to loosen, fall off, and get reduced. Besides, you always know that this little friend is with you as long as you take a goof care of it and can do the job whenever the hairs come back. Just spend $250, follow the instruction, and enjoy your hair-free/reduced body. :) Thanks Remington for such a life/money saver. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: The light cartridge needs to be replaced after 1500 shots. You can get the replacement here on Amazon as well: http://www.amazon.com/Remington-SP6000SB-Professional-Replacement-Cartridge/dp/B005CHHO4Q/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1334537031&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recommend your shaving completely before using IPL;otherwise, since the intense light burns your hair it might hurts, which is not probably a good feeling!! :)e hairs come back. Just spend $250, follow the instruction, and enjoy your hair-free/reduced body. :) Thanks Remington for such a life/money saver. :)    P.S: The light cartridge needs to be replaced after 1500 shots.

    <li> If you are looking for the benefits of hair removal without the hassle and expense of going to a salon this is a great alternative.  The unit itself is not very large, easily fitting underneath the bathroom counter, making it all the more convenient.  I followed the recommended treatment regime and was pleasantly pleased with the results.  The pain is minimal, it&#x27;s like being lightly snapped with a rubber band, and it takes less than 30 minutes tops.  I was very skeptical initially and did a lot of research on all the products available before finally deciding on the I-Light Pro, but I am happy to say that it&#x27;s exceeded my expectations.  I have recommended it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work. I&#x27;ve been through two machines, the first one apparently was faulty and the Return process was flawless by the way, and two cartridges. I am just not noticing a different. A cartridge didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected even though I followed the instructions exactly. Hopefully the cartridge that they sent wasn&#x27;t already used, but it seemed short-lived. I am still suing the second one, so I haven&#x27;t completely given up. I am sorry to say I am not seeing much improvement, and I am hesitant to buy a third cartridge when it comes to it. I should note that I am a biracial woman, but my skin tone is fine for the machine, tested well, but my hair is pretty coarse and dark. If things improve, I&#x27;ll certainly change my review. I&#x27;ll certainly give points to a fairly smooth return process. I didn&#x27;t feel ripped off so much as disappointed.</li>
    <li> May 15, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used laser for two years, in a total of 15 treatments. Some of these treatments were by American Lasers, which, in my case, were the same as I having had no treatment at all. But the remaining treatments were performed by good centers, and all I have now in the areas treated is some baby hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people in the area of hair removal say that laser is better for coarse hair, and ipl is better for baby hair. So I decided to give this a try. This ad may be clearly misleading for so many different reasons. First, it does not even tell us the level of energy used, but still refers that the levels of energy are comparable to clinicians&#x27; levels... Second, all the pictures/ video clips of the results are probably based on results that one can see only in extremely responsive patients.  In my case, my expectations are low: I just want to be able to shave and don&#x27;t see my hair getting coarser. That&#x27;s all, and that&#x27;s the only reason I bought it, granted that most home devices tend not to be as effective as the devices in clinical offices, mostly for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use in fully accessible areas (therefore the 4 out of 5 stars).  You have to place the device properly on the skin, you will hear a beep and only then you can \\&quot;shoot\\&quot;. So if the area is not fully accessible by you, either you don&#x27;t do it well or you ask someone to do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;I used the highest level of energy, since I am used to laser hair removal. It is less painful than the professional YAG laser, it burns the hair. It does not leave any much redness. All this suggests that it is not equally effective to the clinics&#x27; IPL, but let&#x27;s wait and see.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted about the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 10, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had three treatments so far. In each treatment, I even double/ triple pass. But it is just not very effective.&lt;br /&gt;My final advice: I would definitely look for a deal ona good laser (not American Laser), and after I would use this only for maintenance of the other treatment.</li>
    <li> I have been very, surprisingly pleased with this product</li>
    <li> wife really likes this thing. seems to work well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year now. Have never had to replace the bulb.&lt;br /&gt;I mainly wanted a solution for dark hairs growing under my chin/neck. I guess due to aging and hormones my body decided I needed about 100 dark hairs there? I was to tired of plucking and having bumps left after plucking and ingrown hairs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways...I used this on medium setting about twice a week for a month. Then I stopped for a few months. I had less and less hair re-growth. Then I&#x27;d do it again on the remaining hairs twice a week for a month. Then stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a year later I have about 3 stubborn hairs. It would have cost me at least $1,000 for laser treatment at a spa. So I am one happy camper!</li>
    <li> I have had this product for 5 months - I used it 3 times in the first month, and it worked quite well - had around 50% less growth.  Then I went to use it again, and it no longer works.  I bought new cartridges - which were obviously a waste of money, as I can&#x27;t use them.  When I try to use it the sensor won&#x27;t work - it won&#x27;t turn green to allow my to use the machine, even though in the past I have been able to use it.  A product like this should have a 12 month warranty but amazon won&#x27;t allow me to return it now, even though it&#x27;s less than 6 months old and has only been used 3 times.</li>
    <li> So far I like it.. Wish it worked a little faster, but it works none the less.&lt;br /&gt;Its good for the money...</li>
    <li> This item works - and depending on your coloring and hair type, it can work quite well.  Just don&#x27;t expect \\&quot;magic\\&quot; and instant results from a home-use item.  I have found it works best if you put it at the highest level only - you waste less time and use fewer charges this way.  Also, I have very fair skin and very dark body hair - purportedly the best combination for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, I treated some areas (arms and underarms) once a week.  Then lengthened the time between treatments to two weeks, or three - now once every other month - and even then, the hair that returns is far finer and lighter and so far less noticeable.  One of the reasons it has worked so well on my arms and underarms is because I had never epilated those areas - i.e. those hairs had only been shaved (or bleached for the arms).  However, even my lower legs (repeated use of epilator) don&#x27;t grow back as quickly as I would have expected.  It is not as successful on my abdomen - which, from the beginning, had sparser, finer, and lighter hair.  Mixed results on facial hair (and it explicitly says it&#x27;s not for facial use - because the average, ignorant individual will burn themselves or harm their vision and then sue the company).  Essentially, hairs that have been plucked or epilated or removed in that fashion will be more resistant and require more treatment.  Hairs that are darker and thicker will be removed more effectively.  It can take some time to use, depending on how much hair and how many body parts you want to use it on.  However - for those of us who can&#x27;t drop  the $ having their bodies professionally treated, this is an extremely useful home system.  I&#x27;d far rather use this once every other month - even every month if it occasionally proves necessary, rather than constant shaving.  The results are long lasting, and you don&#x27;t get a stubbly regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine worked excellently for 4-5 months (I can&#x27;t recall exactly) and then suddenly stopped.  I called the company,not sure what to expect since I had let the thing sit for at least 5 months after purchasing it before I even tried it, and so was close to 1 year warranty.  There were no questions or hassles - they sent me a pre-paid shipping label within about a week, I returned the broken system, and received a brand-new one shortly thereafter.  I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
    <li> Works really good if you have very light skin and black air.</li>
    <li> Okay, I was all ready to leave a 5 star review, as I have used the Remington IPL for one full body treatment, and have noticed markedly decreased growth in all areas.  I was very excited to start my scheduled second full body treatment tonight, only to get about 2/3 of my left calf done(30 pulses), and the thing quit!!  The little yellow indicator light came on that shows you it no longer has any flashes left, so ...dead in the water with only a small portion of one leg on it&#x27;s way to being hair free. :(. I KNOW I didn&#x27;t come close to using this product for 1500 pulses, so I&#x27;m highly dissatisfied with the fact I now have to order and wait on a new cartridge, not to mention dish out more money way sooner than expected just to continue the treatments.  This product is not that cheap, so to have to chuck out another $25 already after one body treatment is assanine.  I will post an update to this once I complete the remaining treatments.</li>
    <li> First off, im going to say im a guy using this.  Ok let see I just got this about 1 week ago and I can&#x27;t tell if this is working or not so that why my rating is like 3 stars right now. I can share with you what I know so far. I did this to my leg hair and chest hair and so far I can say this thing does hurt A LITTLE kind of like a little sting for every flash and it doesn&#x27;t hurt much in area with fine or less hair but I can tell you this thing really sting somewhat in area where the hair are darker and thicker and I was using this on lowest setting, so my top part of my chest and my leg was really feeling that sting for every flash lol. But so far I think it&#x27;s working....... because.... I tested a little by using a tweezer to plucking a couple strands and they easily come out without any pain but that about it for now. I can see this begin really uncomfortable to use during first time but if hair really does grow out thinner then before or not at all I can see how this is less painful as you use it.    ------------------------------Will Update After 2nd Session-----------------------------------  ALRITE this will be my last review update about this and I like to let you guys know it works great.~ The amount of hair reduction is very visible and I havent had to shave as much as I use to since most of the hair is like gone, dont know if it will grow back but I can see that lot of my body hair is gone and my chest is a lot clearer. I can also tell you the sting isnt as bad as the first time since most of the hair is gone so you barely even feel the sting, I used on 3rd setting for chest/leg, 1st setting for pub area, the pub still hurts must be because the hair thicker down there so it takes longer since im using 1st setting  I tell you why I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars below.    --------------------------------Pros and Cons Section------------------------------------------  Pros:  -Great reduction of hair  -Not very time consuming(Took me about 10-15mins to do both my chest and pub area)  -Don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving everyday now(only do a quick shave in areas I missed)  -No more shaving burns  -No more see those tiny little black spots where the hair is after shaving  Cons:  -Not very accurate...(it&#x27;s really hard to see which area you done and which you havent if you dont pay attention so i end up having to guess where i left off whenever i lose focus and this makes me miss some spots, might be because of the flashes, i suggest you put on a pair of sunglasses or something because that flash might be harmful for you eyes)  -Somewhat painful (I know alot of people say this isnt painful but in truth it all depend on your hair, I find darker thicker hair are much more painful when zapped so this hurts quite a bit in the pub area.... but the pain is like a sting so it goes away after a min, not to bad even though i used lowest setting for pub)  -Hair doesn&#x27;t really naturally fall out....(i dont know why maybe this just me but the hair doesnt really fall out naturally, i needed to use a epilator to pluck the hair out but good thing is that since your hair root should be detached, epilating doesnt hurt at all, only area that should hurt if its the area you missed)</li>
    <li> Was very happy to get this to my wife for Christmas. Unfortunately after one treatment - about 60 or so flashes the light replacement indicator came on and the machine stopped working... interesting, I thought you should get about 1200 flashes or so... I would like the Amazon or Remington send me new cartridge, but the option doesn&#x27;t exist...  When it comes to the machine it self - it worked perfectly and it was very easy to use until it quit... Amazon - Help!!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Remington i-Light Pro from another site (lower price).  This does exactly what it says in 3 to 6 treatments, spaced about 2 weeks apart.  Be advised that the remaining hair in the follicle will gradually work its way out of the pore.  It appears that your hair is growing, but it is not.  There will always be a short hair remaining under the surface of the skin that the body will expel naturally.  Also, remember that each follicle normally has 3 hairs that grow from it - hence the 3 treatments 2 weeks apart.  You can do it sooner than 2 weeks, if you are like me and your hair grows very fast.  Just shave and treat again.  You will have to be vigilant to see the positive results of this product.  But if you are, you will be rewarded with smooth skin in a short period of time.  The effects generally last 6 months (per the website and the brochure), however, mine lasted for about 4.5 months.  As I said, my hair grows crazy fast!  But to not have to shave for 4.5 months instead of EVERY day!?  That is like being in heaven!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The i-Light Pro is the cheapest product of its kind, others go for $299.00 and higher.  I am sure they work as well, but why pay more?  The replacement cartridges are also much cheaper with this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to shave before using the Remington, it will burn the hair and therefore burn you if you do not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement bulbs can be ordered from Remington.com for $24.99 each.</li>
    <li> Out of the box it did not work&lt;br /&gt;Had to send back and waiting on another to try&lt;br /&gt;Should not even leave a star</li>
    <li> Received this as a Christmas gift.  As much as I wanted this product, I have to admit I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work as well as it claimed.  My first treatment was on 1/1/12, my second treatment was on 1/15/12 and my third treatment was on 1/22/12.  I have not shaved since the 1st treatment (instructions are to shave beforehand) and I can&#x27;t believe it...there are less than a dozen hairs on each leg!!!!!!  THIS IS THE BEST HAIR REMOVAL PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!  Its going to save me so much money in razors and shaving cream!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Returned this because it did not do the face area</li>
    <li> I only used it once and could not use it again because it broke my legs out. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Remington IPL6000USA I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this hair removal system on the vine list, I was intrigued. The thought of not having to shave for six months...wow!  However, once I received it, I procrastinated actually using it.  I thought that the instructions were going to be long and cumbersome, I thought it would take a whole evening to do one treatment, I thought it would be painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I pulled the box out and opened it up, read the instructions and watched the video. Fortunately for me, I have naturally light colored skin and brown hair, which is what Remington says, is optimal for this product. And, as it turns out the instructions were not difficult at all: shave and treat, then repeat every two weeks for a total of three treatments. After that I&#x27;ll need to repeat when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to treat my legs while watching television and it didn&#x27;t take nearly as long as I had thought it would.  I felt no pain whatsoever, and used it at its highest energy level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a full week since my first treatment, and the hair in the treated areas is growing back slightly, but not anywhere near a normal &#x60;week&#x27;s worth of growth&#x27;, looks more like I haven&#x27;t shaved in a day or two tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m very impressed, but I will come back and update my results in a few weeks to report on how treatment #2 goes.</li>
    <li> I just began my first treatment today (1-March-2012) and will come back later to update.  As for me Im a guy using this on the chest, stomach and shoulder area.  Not looking to be 100% hairless, just thin out the thick hair I have.  I wanted to write a review right away just to make some initial notes that I thought were not covered in other reviews.  That being said so far the worst thing is something that has nothing to do with the system but still important to note, and that is I am very uncomfortable after shaving.  I feel all prickly and even just putting a shirt on is uncomfortable, it&#x27;s not razor burn its all the prickly hairs sticking out which is a result of shaving for this treatment. And yes I shaved in all directions with shaving cream and hot water so that I would get as close as possible. As for the machine itself I used anywhere between level 1-3 because I thought it was a bit painful when I began.  More like the feeling of a sharp sting and quick burn rather than the rubber band feeling people describe.  This pain subsided fairly quickly but some residual redness remained for about an hour.  So that&#x27;s about it so far, I hate the shaving experience, I hope it grows out quickly so that this stubble/prickly feeling goes away fast and then hopefully the hair starts falling out as well.  If anyone else has a suggestion to remedy that please chime in. Im sticking with 3 stars until I have a more accurate overview.</li>
    <li> Does not keep the hair from coming back as well as I&#x27;d hoped.  Takes a long time to do a back with the small area of laser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of success with this hair removal system.  I had previously had about 8 professional laser hair removal treatments - but needed more - so opted for the home version.  It is definitely A LOT weaker than the professional unit but it&#x27;s still effective. I&#x27;ve noticed considerable hair reduction. I use it on the highest setting and it&#x27;s hardly painful at all - until you get to specific super sensitive areas - then it hurts. When it hurts- it&#x27;s like a combo of very very hot and a rubber band sting at the same time. It&#x27;s very time consuming and takes months and months to see results. Like I said I had 8 professional treatments and still needed more - so don&#x27;t expect quick miracles with a home unit!  I&#x27;ve also gotten very good life out of the light cartridge.  Way more than I expected after reading the reviews. I did my full legs 3 times, armpits &amp; bikini area about a dozen times each --- all with 1 cartridge before it died and needed a replacement. The price on amazon is very good - I did find it at ulta with a coupon for a better deal though. I think at just $25 a pop for the replacement cartridges it&#x27;s a pretty reasonable &amp; effective home hair removal.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a more permanent solution. It does work in the sense that it&#x27;s stunts hair growth and slows it down,but it will grow back! Also the cartridges become very expensive because they do not last long!</li>
    <li> I bought the Ilight through Remington&#x27;s Groupon promo last December.  I have had professional laser hair removal on both my underarms and bikini area, so I can give an honest comparison here.  I bought the Ilight to do my legs because I didn&#x27;t want to shell out big bucks at a professional laser place for a \\&quot;large\\&quot; area.  I have a tattoo on my leg which I have had to avoid through the process because of the dark pigmentation (I accidentally got too close with the laser once and blistered myself.  Ouch.) soI have a \\&quot;test patch\\&quot; for comparison as well.  I&#x27;ve done my legs 4x, plus a couple of treatments to try to maintain the pro hair loss on my underarms and bikini and I&#x27;ve purchased 2 bulbs in addition to the one that came with the unit.  So I&#x27;ve burned through 2 and am working on the 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a pretty big difference after the first 2 treatments, 2 weeks apart.  The results were less drastic and harder to notice the 3rd and 4th time.  I have very fast growing hair; before the iLight if I shaved in the morning I&#x27;d have a visible \\&quot;5 o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; by night.  My 4th treatment was 2 weeks ago, and at this time I can shave every other day.  Today is my 3rd day without shaving.  I can definitely see some patches of hair here and there if I look closely and it feels a bit stubbly but I&#x27;d still wear shorts and no one would know unless they looked very closely.  The untreated tattooed area is much hairier and the hairs are thicker and closer together.  Over all I&#x27;d say the treated areas have about 40% less hair.  My plan is to do sessions once a month from here on out for maintenance.  As far as value goes, I&#x27;m happy with being able to shave 1/2 as often and have the hair be less noticeable when I don&#x27;t.  I definitely feel less like a beast.  Yeah, I was hoping for better results, but a $20 cartridge every few months after the initial $199 isn&#x27;t so bad for being able to skip shaving half of the time.  We do a lot of boating, and before the iLight I carried adisposable razor and dry shaving lotion with me.  No joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how does it compare to professional laser hair removal?  I saw big results, faster.  But the hair still regrew.  After 5 pro treatments on my bikini and underarms, I still have to shave.  There was only a brief period after the 4th treatment or so where I seemed to be nearly hairless.  Then there was a flush of hair, I had one more treatment and and gave up because the price was prohibitive and the hair kept coming back.  There was no way I&#x27;d be done after a sixth treatment, which is what most laser centers advertise.  I spent $500 and that was with a deep discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the iLight going to make you completely hairless? No.  But if you, like me, had to shave every day like I did, you might not have to anymore.  Are you going to have to shell out $20 for a new cartridge every few months once you get to the \\&quot;maintenance\\&quot; phase? Yep.  Is it worth it, IMO to have legs that don&#x27;t start feeling prickly an hour after I shave them?  You bet.  Just have realistic expectations.  I&#x27;d buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and jack the thing up to it&#x27;s max flash when you use it.  You only get so many flashes and you&#x27;ll get more bang for your buck.  Yeah, it hurts.  Especially on sensitive areas.  But so does waxing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this around christmas primarily to use on my face which when i got it I found out that you were not supposed to use it on facial hair.  I decided to try it anyways as shaving has always been a pain and my beard has always been a joke (sparse and patchy).  I have a fair complexion and dark brown hair so that worked in my favor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first session I cranked it up to max and tried it on my neck and it hurt like hell so I reduced it down to 3 and did from my cheekbones down.  I didn&#x27;t notice anything 2 weeks later so I put it on the highest setting and toughed it out.  About 2 weeks later I did notice a difference and changed to doing it 1-2x a week alternating horizontal / diagonal each time.  Sometimes I shave beforehand sometimes I don&#x27;t depending on how long it is.  Seems to work better w. some hair out plus you can see where you need to hit.  I do wash my face before and after but don&#x27;t use anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in a professional environment shaving has sucked my whole life as if i shave more often than every 4 days my face breaks out and burns like crazy.  Granted this hurt a bit but the sting only lasts about 30 minutes or so vs a few days.  I haven&#x27;t had any burns there is redness but like the sting that fades about 30m after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now all i have are a few patches left on my neck so I feel i got my moneys worth.  Once those patches are gone I&#x27;ll probably stop using it till the hairs come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is the bulb life is way too short.  I&#x27;m guessing maybe 500-700 flashes before it dies and definitely not the 1000-1500 they say.  I&#x27;ve went through 3 bulbs so far and that is just using it on my face.</li>
    <li> 3/9/12 Decided to give this a try based on reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far the process is easy and not nearly as painful or messy as waxing.  Yes there is a sting, I used the highest setting under arms, bikini and lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However the pain is minimal compared to waxing. And when I finished it&#x27;s done. Wipe the wand and put it away. No sticky wax under my nails, or on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure the results are not immediate as waxing. But once the hair begins to fall out it should just be a minimal upkeep process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my results after a few weeks. If it works as well as I&#x27;m hoping I will tell everyone I know about this!!  Finally&lt;br /&gt;a reasonable option for long term hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is light/medium and my hair is dark.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with excess hair all of my life.  I&#x27;ve dealt with the ridicule in grade school and in high school and as I got older it has gotten worse on my face.  The hassle of plucking and shaving everyday was just too much.  My sister told me about this I light and I was so eager to try it just on time for my Jamaica vacation.  Ive been using it for a little over a month and I LOVE IT! The hair has diminished dramatically and I have to shave less.  I highly recommend it and I&#x27;m so pleased!!!!</li>
    <li> My best guess is it would take 5-6 cartridges and 4 months to MAYBE see a difference. I did my calfs and noticed a few spots of reduced hair growth- but never got to the point of not shaving. And the best part, if you get through $150 in cartridges and 4 months later, you get to start all over- because the hair is only gone for a few weeks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS NOT LIKE A LASER treatment. The hair WILL GROW back- the process is more like a bad epilator- over the long term laser is cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges do not pulse 1500 ad the product advertises- Remington either needs to make better cartridges or sell them cheaper. and the best part is the return policy is only 30 days-not enough time to even tell if it works since you have to wait 2 weeks between treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> Yes, I had to see it to believe it. This is an essentially painless and effective hair removal system with long lasting results. I have coarse dark hair that would grow back very quickly after shaving.  I always hated to shave and would almost always end up with a shaving rash. Lately, the rash had been getting worse, so I started trying  cream hair removers.  Everything I tried seemed to cause skin irritation, no matter how hypoallergenic or gentle the label promised.  When I found this system, I researched it for weeks before I purchased it.  I thought the testimonials were too good to be true.  But, out of desperation, I purchased it, along with a replacement cartridge.  You can do about one and one half treatment cycles with the first cartridge, so it is a good idea to order a replacement cartridge so that you can complete the total six week treatment cycle. Just shave your legs, pop in a movie, and do the treatments once every two weeks for three treatments.  It really is painless, easy, and effective.  What else can I tell you?  I even have a great bikini line for the first time since I started shaving (even though I am past the age where a bikini is appropriate...at my age, it would be more like a boo-kini...to quote my daughter).  So if you are sick of shaving your legs and underarms, try this.  Don&#x27;t order it if your skin is too dark, or if your hair is blonde or gray.  It only works for golden to pale skin tones with dark hair follicles.  Read all the precautions and warnings before ordering or using.</li>
    <li> So I have had my little machine an entire month, and I wanted to do it this long to ensure my review was accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with saying I have wanted to do laser hair removal for the past ten years, because my skin HATES me shaving and gets in grown hairs and such.  I also am a mom, so its harder for me to just up and go to appointments forty minutes away (w/o traffic) to get a session done. But I was looking at paying $700 to do just my underarms, and there is always that chance you will need follow up appointments (which would be 50% of the original amount). So when I saw this and read all the reviews I thought why not. Then it dropped down to $203 one day, so I automatically bought it and did the next day prime shipping &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been doing the treatments weekly, and so far I can tell a difference in how my hair is growing back so much slower!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I also take the cartage out each time and clean it, so far the cartage hasnt quit on me.  It doesn&#x27;t really hurt on my legs, and my underarms it stings but by no means will I quit using this!! With shaving then using this my skin is behaving better, and not getting ingrown hairs nearly as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I get to do this in my home, while my son is asleep!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get that it isn&#x27;t professional results, because I am doing this weekly. But I do three areas and I am done easily under an hour. I do put seabreeze on my skin once I am done, but that is just to help prevent ingrown hairs after the shaving (dont put anything on your skin before doing the laser, I do it once I am dry out of the shower). But for the price and convenience it is well worth 200 bucks. My sister is going to get one this summer b/c I have loved mine!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch the prices here on amazon and it will drop back down to right above 200 dollars, get one and you will never look back!!!</li>
    <li> I have been waiting to post this review until I have had a chance to use the product for some time. I bought this because I had starting getting ingrown hairs after I would shave my legs and armpits. I have used this probably three times on my legs and maybe ten or so on my underarms. I have noticed significant hair reduction on my legs and a slight on my underarms. I still get ingrown hairs every now and again but not like I was. I use it on the highest setting and my skin is considered fair with yellow undertones. My facial concealer is named fairly golden and I tan very easy if that helps. Also, my hair was not that thick to begin with but I can go a lot longer between shaving my legs that I did before. The cartridges are not the best but I will not complain because had I gone to a clinic, I would have paid a lot more.</li>
    <li> I bought the i-Light to treat my underarms and bikini but I decided to try my underarms first. I was a little bit skeptical when I bought the product but I followed the directions and eagerly awaited results. It took me a few minutes to treat each underarm and I was able to use the product on the highest power level without any discomfort. I finished my third treatment 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m amazed with the results. My underarms are perfectly smooth and except for a few sporadic hairs that have popped up, the area really is smooth and hair-free. Today I&#x27;m going to blast away the last few hold-outs and I look forward to a season without shaving. Now on to the bikini...</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times.  I still get all the green lights and not an bad bulb.  This machine no longer pulses anymore defective and useless. Poor quality broken in less then a month with very little usage.  Never saw an reduction in hair from first treatment either.</li>
    <li> I received my I-Light on Christmas Eve and just exhausted the first cartridge.  I was able to complete 3 full treatments on the legs, arms, and bikini, just as advertised.  The machine is very easy to use and they provide ample cord length.  The only problem that I had was the initial unlocking of the machine with the skin tone sensor.  It is winter in Ohio and I am quite literally the lightest skin color on the guide!  I am not scanning over any moles or dark areas and am using in a well lit bathroom.  With my initial excitement, I overlooked this issue.  As my use has continued, it has become much more frustrating.  It sometimes requires 10 or 20 scans just to unlock the machine for use.  I contacted Remington and they sent a prepaid shipping label to exchange for a new machine.  I&#x27;m anxiously waiting for my replacement to arrive as I am starting to see results!  There is about 30% less hair on my legs, one armpit has 50% less hair (on the other armpit 40% is growing very slowly), no obvious change yet on the bikini area.  Assuming no problems with my exchanged unit and continued results, I&#x27;ll be updating to a 5 star rating.  The price is exceptional, and you have the privacy of treating yourself in the convenience of your own home!  ***UPDATE*** 2/12/12  My exchange with Remington went flawlessly and the new/repaired unit is working perfectly.  It has unlocked every time with my first scan.  I haven&#x27;t had the remarkable results that some report (according to Remington, in clinical trials after 3 treatments there was an average reduction of 47.8% at six months).  My hair reduction is probably closer to clinical trial results vs those reporting not shaving after one treatment.  I am not disappointed with the progress; I just want future users to have realistic expectations.  Also I&#x27;ve been thinking about how to direct future treatments once my hair is more sporadic and here is my idea so far. Allow the hair to grow out a bit so I can clearly see which areas need further treatment, outline with a white eyeliner pencil, and then shave those spots with an electric razor. This will give a clearly defined treatment area, using an electric razor you can be sure to preserve the outlines, and the white eyeliner shouldn&#x27;t attract the light energy. I&#x27;m not far enough along that it is an issue yet, but with the progress I&#x27;m making, I expect to be by the end of my 2nd cartridge!</li>
    <li> I only used it twice so far, it says 3 times for maximum.  Right off the bat with really noticeable and did what is was made for.  The only problem I had was figuring out how to start it.  Once I did, I love it.</li>
    <li> It is cheaper to buy from amazon , coming with the origignal packing and the cd to explain how to use it in english&lt;br /&gt;all what u need is to buy extra Replacement Cartridge to avoide any silly setuation while using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, but I don&#x27;t see any difference in my hair after using it multiple times. I know they say it is temporary, but here&#x27;s the deal - if you shaved your hair THAT close, it takes quite a lot of time for it to grow back. I didn&#x27;t see significant results that prove against a placebo effect. (I&#x27;m a scientist so I treated one arm, and left the other untreated to see if I could tell any difference.)</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting any results, figuring I&#x27;m too hairy for this to really work, but I have been really surprised at my results 1 month in.  My underarms only have a few tiny patches of hair left and my bikini area (which consists of my entire inner thigh down to my knees - yuck!) is about 50% bald (in patches too). Now I can distinctly see where I need to hit with the light and am very optimistic for my final results.  I&#x27;m eager to see how long it lasts!  Waxing has always been my summer method and was shaving within 3 weeks of doing it...I am hopeful I will be hair free much longer with this.</li>
    <li> What can I say, I am thrilled to leave a 5 star review.  Finally a solution for an at home hair removal that works.  My friend recommended it to me a few months ago; I&#x27;ve been using it regularily and have seen results!  To me the process is virtually effortless. Its easy, simple, and painfree.  I&#x27;m so excited to never have to buy another razor again.</li>
    <li> UPDATE  (6/1/12):****  I did my two week laser treatment and as expected, I can not see a difference in my hair loss yet.  This time did hurt more than last time though.  I put it on 5 both times, so it must just be me.  I did notice a couple of spots near my bikini area which look like they have been burned.  it has been almost a week and those red spots have not disappeared yet. My husband gave it a shot this time around.  If he keeps up the treatment, I&#x27;ll update you on his progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INITIAL REVIEW:  I received my I-light pro today.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I spend TONS of money on shaving, waxing, electrolysis, and professional laser treatments (that were obviously not permanent or I would not have a need for this product).  I am giving this 5 stars today because it worked exactly like it said it would right out of the box.  It didn&#x27;t hurt nearly as bad as any of the other ways you get rid of hair (besides shaving and those nasty creams that stink to high heaven).  It was easy to use and I was able to do my underarms, full legs, bikini area and belly on the highest setting, without replacing the light cartridge (yet).  I was able to do all of that in about an hour.  I have all intentions on updating this in two weeks when I do my second treatment and again in two weeks after that.  I bought this product with my own money.  I do not work for Remington, nor are they paying me for this review.  I am a real person who is looking for hair removal results.</li>
    <li> I would like to know if it works well in Middle EAST countries power!if any one could help me here .i&#x27;m on my way to order it.thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple months now at least, and have used it primarily for my arms, shoulders and back (with some use on my upper chest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, dark hair, and my skin varies in certain areas (farmers tan) and I didn&#x27;t notice any real changes in usefulness based on that.  I started by doing as it said by using the system in 2 week intervals,  at the end of 6 weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed less hair in certain areas,  and some areas where it seems to not be successful at reducing hair at all.  I&#x27;ve spent a good time since \\&quot;touching up\\&quot; the same areas, and with persistence I&#x27;ve started to see real results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the pain goes.. some areas where the hair is longer or I had more of a concentration,  it really hurts on the highest setting.  It wouldn&#x27;t burn my skin or anything like that,  but there was a lot of redness afterwards.  If you are sensitive I would suggest getting the gel or maybe icing the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bulb usage has been good,  I bought an extra bulb and haven&#x27;t had to replace it, and I&#x27;ve done my back, arms and shoulders for at least a couple months now, as well as allowed my friends to try it and I think I&#x27;ve gotten way more use out of this bulb then I expected based on the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only other thought... looks like the lens can get pretty dirty so make sure you clean it right after every use.  With the results I&#x27;ve gotten, I&#x27;m not hairless like I expected by this time,  but I see a lot of improvement, so if you&#x27;re the kind of person who can stay vigilant, I would say this is well worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Love this.  It really works.</li>
    <li> **UPDATE**  (4/28/14)&lt;br /&gt;  What can I say? I started Nursing school so I set this aside for a while, and I totally noticed when it got to my 6 month time. Since then I have used it for a second round. I just use it here and there now, but I try to hit myself at least once a month to keep the growth from coming back like it did before. It didn&#x27;t grow DIFFERENTLY, I just got really use to thinned, slowed growth. &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not seeing any damage to my skin or anything. No overly sensitive areas, no lightening of the skin. No burns, no scarring, etc etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still happy with the product. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey there everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be a review for the remington i-light pro premier intense pulsed light hair removal system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am medium skin toned (I got tanner as this went on because it is summer and I tan easily) and my hair is dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR version: This system worked for me. After the 3 first treatments I have seen slowed hair growth and less appearance of hair. The real results won&#x27;t show up (according to the book) for 1-2 months after those first treatments because the hair has to work its way out, so if I remember, I will update later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the rest...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to encourage conversation here... please, ask me questions. When I was debating on purchasing this system, I really would have liked someone to speak with about it. Just leave a comment and I will do my best to keep up with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, up front, I AM NOT a product reviewer. I didn&#x27;t get this system for free to use. I spent my own hard earned money on this. (which is why I was desperate for an honest review... and for the most part I wasn&#x27;t finding any-- when I see the same review, word for word, on the remington site, walmart, amazon, etc... I know it isn&#x27;t a true review. -_- )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is an honest review from me. I went into this very, very non-optimistic. This was my last resort before going to a professional salon and sinking in the big bucks for hair removal. I have used every cream, buffer, razor, etc on the market with no results. (and in some cases, painful results. Some of those creams are no joke.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Where did I use the remington i-light pro premier intense pulsed light hair removal system?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Well... I won&#x27;t lie. I went and bought this system almost 100% for my face. That was my driving force behind it, even though I *KNEW* this system was not designed for my face.&lt;br /&gt;  I figured I may as well go full monty and use it on my legs, bikini area, and underarms while I was at it. I used a 3 on my face, and a 5 on the rest of my body. The 3 was enough for my face since there are a lot of sensitive areas there. My personal recommendation, if you use it on your face, go with a lower zap and wear eye protection. And don&#x27;t go above the cheek bone or use it on your eyebrow area. KEEP IN MIND THAT REMINGTON, AS A COMPANY, DOES NOT ENDORSE THIS. I WILLING USED THE SYSTEM THIS WAY, DESPITE WARNING. I don&#x27;t want anyone thinking that what I did was acceptable, but if you CHOOSE to do it, be as safe as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Was the remington i-light pro premier intense pulsed light hair removal system hard to use?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  About my only complaint is that the system is kind of bulky. But that is all. It turned on just fine for me, and was easy to put back in the package for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Are the Cartridges bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This was the BIGGEST complaint I read about. I am sure it is a cartridge to cartridge issue, but my original one lasted me through 2.75 uses. I had to put a new one in to finish up my leg on my last use, but I am pretty sure I got 1500 flashes or so out of it. I do recommend keeping a spare one though, because (like any technology) you might get a bad one here or there. I had no issues with it though &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Does it hurt?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Heh. Depends. I use to pluck facial hair, and it hurt meplenty good, and even on a 3, this system was still kind of rough. But that is ME. My skin is sensitive, especially on my face and neck, so I expected this. Just keep a realistic outlook when you use it, and if it hurts, lower the level.&lt;br /&gt;  On the rest of my body, the only place it make me jump a bit was the backs of my legs, and that was at a level 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. Does it work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It worked for me, as a medium toned, dark haired woman. (This is an early review too, I finished the 3rd treatment today.)&lt;br /&gt;  Now, my results on my face are not as drastic as elsewhere on my body, because I used a lower zap. I will continue the treatments as needed, but it will take a bit longer to see the same results as my legs, on my face.&lt;br /&gt;  My legs, underarms, and bikini area are all pretty awesome. I get a patch here and there, but they are barely noticeable. I do not have to be as exact with shaving as I use to be, and I can definitely go longer without shaving. (I use to have to shave EVERY 24 hours, or I was looking rough. Now I can go a couple days with no problem.)&lt;br /&gt;  These are not even my full results. It will be another month or two to get through the full hair cycle, plus other hairs coming INTO cycle will start growing as well. So I won&#x27;t see a true result for at least another month. This is a process.... even professional salons will tell you the same thing. It takes time, and patience, but I am already seeing results that I am pleased with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Shave as close as possible. Most of the pain and heat I dealt with was where I got sloppy with my shaving. The closer, the better.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Use cocoa butter, or lotion on the areas you zap. I didn&#x27;t experience irritation or dryness, but I was pretty quick to lotion up. It just makes sense to me to lotion after IPLing.&lt;br /&gt;  3. Set aside time to do this. It would take me around an hour to do all the parts I wanted to hit-- which isn&#x27;t much time, but I needed to sit down and kind of yoga through some parts. It helped to know that I could sit on the floor, take my time, and make sure I got all the areas I wanted without interruption.&lt;br /&gt;  4. Be patient. I know it is frustrating, and I know how badly people want results (especially in the face area) but if you over-do it, you can harm yourself. Just give the system a chance to work the way it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all I have for now. I hope this review helps. Again, leave questions if you&#x27;d like. I will do my best to answer them.plenty good, and even on a 3, this system was still kind of rough. But that is ME. My skin is sensitive, especially on my face and neck, so I expected this.

    <li> I figured I would be the perfect candidate for this product - I have a very pale complexion and my hair follicles are plainly visible after shaving. The unit is designed to pick up on the darker spots as compared to the skin and target them with the light. There is a mild and brief burning/heat and that&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I followed the instructions to the letter and have had absolutely no results. It is a lot of money to spend on nothing.</li>
    <li> This is a review after using the product for 6 month, for more, see Hair Off blogspot,&lt;br /&gt;hair-off.  blogspot. com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work great on underarms and bikini area, no ingrown hairs! Not as permanent as promised, also rather uncomfortable or painful, but much better results than waxing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the iLightPro in November 2011 (~$200), and have had to buy a new light bulb ($~20) since, and just noticed today that it&#x27;s time for a new bulb again (the warning light is on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using the iLight Pro on my legs, but I&#x27;ll eventually get back to it. There&#x27;s no difference in hair growth noticeable on my legs, I think I&#x27;ve used it there 3-4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am regularly doing my underarms and bikini area (every 2 weeks, pretty much since January). There&#x27;s definitely much less hair, but it is not hair free. But I need to shave less, and it looks very smooth after shaving (I used to see these dark spots even right after shaving). I try to shave as careful as possible, but the iLight is rather uncomfortable in those areas, I am only using in on the lowest setting, in comparison, I can wax and epilate without making a big fuzz about the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using the iLight pro, because shaving by itself is not giving me the results I want, and epilating results in too many ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- absolutely no ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;- using the iLight every two weeks does not consume too much time, also, it doesn&#x27;t need to be heated up or charged or anything, it&#x27;s mess-free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - I am not \\&quot;hair-free\\&quot; as promised&lt;br /&gt;- it is not permanent, I had seen improvement on my legs, but once I stopped using the iLight it went straight back to what it used to be</li>
    <li> The item was described as being new but arrived looking used and repackaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Round 2: I decided to try it again. Nothing happened. There&#x27;s still hair. I thought maybe it needed a little time. A couple months later and still nothing. Not even slower growth. Such a waste of money.</li>
    <li> The light is only good for 1500 shots.  That literally translates to one use for the legs and you can&#x27;t even finish your underarms.  The light head that came with the unit went out after five shots, so I put in the replacement and guess what it only lasted for one and a half legs.  This should be an embarrassment for a company like Remington, and it was a total waste of money for me.  I will think twice before I buy anything that is a Remington Product again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair removal kit for almost 6 months now and it has had NO effect at all!</li>
    <li> In short--best beauty product purchase of the year, and perhaps ever!  I am a fair-skinned brunette, so I have exactly the right coloring for this device.  I do not hesitate to highly recommend this product if you have similar coloring.  My bikini area and underarms are dramatically improved.  Pay attention to the color of the hair you want to remove, though.  I&#x27;ve found the hair on my legs to be a little too light for this to have dramatic results.  If you have freckles--no worries!  I have freckles and have noticed no adverse response.  All-in-all, you will be pleased.  It costs less than one laser treatment, is much less painful than waxing and best of all, you can preserve your dignity and privacy by doing it yourself--again, and again, and again--as needed.  I&#x27;m still on my first bulb, so not everyone has issues with that.  Regardless, it is very inexpensive over the long term when compared to spa services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Below are some details of my early experience with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only just completed my first treatment, which went flawlessly.  I was surprised and pleased that there was less discomfort than anticipated. It was quite a bit less painful than epilation.  I turned it up to the highest setting by the third pulse (pulsed once on the first setting, once on the third setting and then proceeded with the 5th level from there on).  It is definitely best to shave as thoroughly as possible. The treatment was most uncomfortable where the most hair was visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as I have the opportunity to observe results.  So far, my impression is entirely favorable.  The unit seems to be high quality and not a torture device, as I feared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 1/20/2012.  Like another reviewer, I decided to use this at closer intervals than directed.  Second treatment was even easier than the first. I&#x27;m not sure whether that was due to increased attention to my shaving efforts prior to treatment or if I can expect each successive treatment to be less uncomfortable due to hair reduction.  Regardless, it was a breeze!  Much, much, much easier than the epilator (ouch!) that I use on peach fuzz.  It is also very quick--no downtime between pulses.  The only challenging part can be around bony areas where it can be difficult to get both sensors pressed simultaneously to enable a pulse.  Even that is no big deal--it&#x27;s usually just a matter of adjusting positioning of the handpiece horizontally or vertically to get the treatment window and sensors flush to the skin. Still no obvious results, but I didn&#x27;t expect any yet.  Will continue to update as I use the device and note results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, 1/26/2012.  Again, I chose to treat at a shorter time interval than instructed (only 6 days this time).  Honestly, it seems like I could use this daily without problem.  There are zero after effects for me--not even redness.  This third treatment was also virtually painless. Just a few hot, prickly sensations where there was more hair.  I have also been zapping one spot on my chin where a single rogue hair tends to pop up.  I&#x27;m careful to shield my eyes and it seems totally fine.  The treatments are really quick.  I was reading about a competing system that isn&#x27;t available in the US as far as I can tell, and the unit needs to recharge between pulses which results in a prolonged treatment session.  Not the case with the iLight!  You can zap as quickly as you want.  It literally takes less than a minute to do my underarms and less than 2 for the bikini zone.  My leg takes longer since it&#x27;s significantly larger.  Still no big deal, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am  really noticing results on my under arms and bikini.  This morning my under arms had no noticeable hair.  Bikini is more sparse and finer.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference on my legs, but I will stick with it.  Even if I end up with less and finer growth, I&#x27;ll consider it a partial win since I&#x27;ll be less prickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought for anyone who is afraid of even the minimal amount of discomfort.  Perhaps a numbing cream might help?  Here is a link to one I chose based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  [[ASIN:B00697I9RE Dr. Numb Topical Anesthetic Lidocaine Numbing Cream for Pain Relief - 30 grams]]y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought for anyone who is afraid of even the minimal amount of discomfort.

    <li> RECEIVED 12/24/2011..........................  Treatment sites:  arms (never had hair removal before)  underarms ( over 20 laser treatments,  have about a dozen hairs left)  bikinni  ( had over 20 laser treatments,  VERY little hair left)  legs (had over 20 laser treatments, but thighs and knees are still an issue)  Jan-  First month had treatments every Monday.  Able to keep it on the highest setting.  Saw nothing different at all.  In fact was disappointed.  I had over 20 laser treatments in the past, so I just have some hair in some areas.  Arms are a new project though.  Feb-  Due to period I skipped a week due to extra sensitivity.  Today is 2/11/12 and I have completed the 6th treatment.  I have noticed hair is more patchy on my arms, but I can not tell if the other hair is gone from the root, or just burnt to the root bulb, I can see faint black dots if I look close?  I am still not sure.  QUESTION:  How is everyone at the 2 month mark?  I am thinking my hair my not be in a phase where it will fall out yet?  TIPS:  I use aloe vera afterwards sometimes to lesson pain if there is any.  I will put updates as I see more hair removal.  I like using it a lot, but wish the treatment window was bigger as I have a hard time remembering where I went over.  So far I am on my second bulb.  I have just purchased some form amazon..  HAIR LOSS?  So far I see like 25% gone from arms, and can not really tell anywhere else.  Could be I am not that hairy anywhere else so harder to tell.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Groupon, but didn&#x27;t know that this thing doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL on light hair. Mine isn&#x27;t even really blonde; it&#x27;s a light brown/amber. I&#x27;m getting some carbon dye to see if that helps, but I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. But on the bright side, I let my black-haired roomie use this and it worked really well for her.  But really, for the price, I&#x27;d go with a laser instead. That way, you won&#x27;t have to worry about replacing light bulbs.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product with a little bit of hesitation as it is expensive but thought I would give it a try. I used it primarily on leg and arm hair. I have a fair complexion and brown hair which is supposedly ideal for the best results for this item. I read the directions so I would get the full benefits of the IPL. The IPL was small, nicely made and easy to use and wasn&#x27;t painful even on the highest setting. I used it twice in 2 weeks as directed and was ready to use it for the third time. Upon turning the unit on the third time it did not chirp to indicate it was ready. I decided to return it since it was not working properly. Of course I did not get to see the benefits from prolonged use over time, but it did not seem to stop any hair from coming back in the spots that I used it on. They stated in the instruction booklet that you should see up to a 45% decrease in hair after just 2 uses. I did not see that result. I may have seen a 5% decrease but it is very difficult to say. Since the IPL wasn&#x27;t working correctly and I was disappointed, I returned the unit for a refund.</li>
    <li> Directions indicate using every two weeks, but this is not enough to eliminate all hairs at once. Information states that results last 6 months... more like 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Update 4/22/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product every week now. I am so happy with the results!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair on my right leg is gone to the point that I cannot see any. I haven&#x27;t shaved in two weeks. I can feel the white hair, but this product says that it cannot get rid of that type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My armpits are being more stubborn and can&#x27;t seem to stop all the hair. So I still have to shave it once a week. But it definitely is about 95% gone so I&#x27;m hoping that it will all be gone within the next two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My woman area is about 95% gone. There is no grown long hair after a week, but I can see the stubbles under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first replacement cartridge that customer support sent me died right as I was finishing my treatment this weekend. It lasted me 5 treatments on my entire body. Very pleased with the duration of this cartridge compared to the one that came with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/1/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received two replacement cartridges instead of just one(yay!) I have done three treatments since my last post and I can definitely see results everywhere that I have used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my armpits, I can tell that the hair on my left armpit is more than 75% gone compared to my right armpit. I use the max setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my legs, my right leg has about 50% less hair than my left. I&#x27;m thinking that the reason it isn&#x27;t as drastic as my armpits is because it&#x27;s harder to hit every spot on my leg plus my leg hair isn&#x27;t as thick as my armpit hair. Max setting is used on legs as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my woman area, were I have zapped, the hair is entirely gone. It is a perfect product for the bikini line. Very painful down there so I only use the first setting and don&#x27;t do anything except the bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the results. Not sure why the original cartridge failed on me but am very satisfied with the customer service when I called in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my next treatment, I probably won&#x27;t shave before hand so that I know exactly what area needs to be zapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not giving it 5 stars due to having trouble knowing which areas need to be zapped and the first cartridge experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/9/12:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just went to use the item on my leg and it flashed twice then stopped. The cartridge indicator is still green. The item beeps like it&#x27;s ready to flash then I hear a click inside the unit but it never flashes. Died during the second use.... sad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original post:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I just purchased this item last week. I did my first treatment on my right leg this morning. The feeling of the item is nice and comfortable to use. I&#x27;m not sure how well I am at moving it slowly enough to ensure that I am covering my entire leg though. I started off using the lowest intensity setting. Next treatment, I will try to go with a higher setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Will update in two weeks with a comparison of my legs....</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I am a very frugal person who needs to make the most for every dollar spent.  I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal (as a gift)in the past that cost twice as much as this product.  This product works just as well as the professional treatments I&#x27;ve had.  I am extremely pleased with the results after only four treatments.  I have seen almost complete reduction in some areas (my underarms).  My legs are a little more stubborn (possibly because my skin is darker from sun exposure) and they haven&#x27;t showed much reduction yet, but the growth has slowed down quite a bit.  I used to have to shave them each day and now it is every third day or so.  I am fairly certain that with more treatments I will get the same results as my underarms. Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> I got my first replacement cartridge on 2/15, did one full body treatment and when I went to do second treatment today, it died in the middle of my first leg!  Just 11 days after I got it!  Is this for real??  Because this is going to be ridiculous if I have to replace the cartridge after each treatment!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with hair removal in various ways for over 15 years.  Began over 15 years ago with electrolysis and eventually did laser hair removal at a doctor&#x27;s office.  Laser hair removal done with professional grade equipment worked for me, this product did not.  I&#x27;ve had this item for several months now using it as directed and do not see any results.  If you use it every 2 weeks it seems to \\&quot;stun\\&quot; the hair a bit, but this is not worth the price tag.  I was hoping for a miracle, but didn&#x27;t get it.  I guess there is just not a way yet to duplicate the power of the machines at a doctor/dermatologist/salon office. Don&#x27;t waste your $$$  :(</li>
    <li> Perhaps one day we will live in a world where male back-hair is slick and trendy. But until then, just purchase this and consider yourself lucky we live in such advanced times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to own a Tria which somewhat worked but was terribly slow. Slow enough that you were hesitant to use it. Remington IPL, on the other hand, works perfectly and is lightning fast. A few minutes covers my entire back and the hair barely grows back. (after two treatments)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, this is the first REAL solution to body hair removal.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m a fair-haired, light-complexioned woman, I don&#x27;t have a profusion of body or facial hair, so this product wasn&#x27;t necessary. But I&#x27;m a technology freak and just had to have it...regardless. It wasn&#x27;t until I read the instructions that inform us it&#x27;s not for fair-skinned people that I realized my mistake. It&#x27;s not for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that in mind, I don&#x27;t know how to rank it. It wouldn&#x27;t be fair to give it low marks when I haven&#x27;t really given it a try, so I&#x27;ll take only one point off because it takes a lot of patience to wait weeks for results... I&#x27;d rather be writing books or reviews. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by Betty Dravis, April 18, 2012&lt;br /&gt;Author of \\&quot;Six-Pack of Blood\\&quot; (with Barbara Watkins)</li>
    <li> New Review:  When I first got first got this product, I was super disappointed. The bulb didn&#x27;t work! I posted the review below, Remington read it, and they sent me a new one ASAP at no cost - which was awesome. I have now had the product for about two years (and still on that same bulb!) and absolutely love it! I am in my mid twenty&#x27;s, female, dark brown hair and super pale skin (think Snow White... or a ghost). My major insecurities came from a nice dark happy trail I believe i inherited from my dad (ugh). I was so self-concious when I was a teenager and in college when I wanted to wear a swimsuit. If I shaved the area, you could still tell there was hair there because my pale skin would show the hair underneath. Plus, I would get major shaving irritation. If I waxed, it would go away for a while but then grow back at different rates and gave me terrible ingrowns. In short I felt awful. I bought this strictly to get rid of the happy trail, and I have never been happier. I can finally walk around in a bathing suit and show my stomach without wanting to cover myself up with my arms or a shirt. I have also started experimenting with my armpits, and boy does that thing HURT (I use it on full setting), but it works! It takes a little longer to see results (maybe 2 weeks using it 2-3/week), but when I did, I was completely hair free!!!! I am hair-free for about a month before it starts coming back (at which point is the time to start taking it back out again so it doesn&#x27;t take as long to get rid of it again). After reading reviews on upper-lip areas, I may start doing that as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing! Definitely worth the money!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;_________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Old review:&lt;br /&gt;I got this product today and was so excited to use it I immediately ripped open the package right when I got home.  After reading all of the reviews about people saying their original cartridge didn&#x27;t last long, I ordered a replacement just in case.  Iread through all the instructions and set it up, turned it on, and was able to get through my bikini line (which, by the way, hurts a LOT even on setting 1) before the cartridge died.  A whole 10 lights or so.  I am NOT happy about spending $250 bucks on something that works for literally 2 minutes and then goes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I turned it off, took out the cartridge, then put it back in.  This gave me one more light, and then stopped working again.  Since I was at least able to do my bikini line (btw I&#x27;m a very pale skinned, dark haired female), I&#x27;ll update in a few weeks after I&#x27;ve undergone the second round of lights.  Hopefully my replacement cartridge works more than 10 times, otherwise amazon is getting this product back.</li>
    <li> I have been following instructions precisely and have yet to notice any signs that the product does what it claims.  This product does not work.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not end up working for me... I tried it for about 1.5 months using it once a week, and did not notice any real results.  I have pale skin and brown hair (for comparison purposes).</li>
    <li> First off let me start by saying that those of you who are using this more often than every 2 weeks are wasting your bulbs.  That being said, I must say that this is working.  I didn&#x27;t notice much after the first treatment.  But that changed dramatically after the 2nd.  I am treating my lower legs, under arms and bikini area.  I have medium skin tone (freckles, but tan easily) and dark hair.  I am now on my 4th treatment and nearly hair free.  Just when I thought I was at a stand still and the treatments were no longer working, more hairs just seem to fall out overnight.  This was very close to the two week mark between treatments.  That&#x27;s why I say you are just wasting the bulb if you use it more often, as it did take 2 weeks to notice less hair.  My bikini area definitely saw the fastest results.  Maybe because of the coarser hair.  I am down to shaving my legs and underarms once a week.  The hair that I have left is very fine.  Hopefully the treatment I did today will yield even more results!  Oh, I have been using it on the highest setting, with only minimal discomfort under my arms.  But I just grit my teeth and know it&#x27;s worth it.  It only lasts a split second.  :)  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is the price of the bulbs and the fact I have needed more treatments than I thought I would.  Overall, I am very happy.</li>
    <li> ANYONE ONE STARING THIS PRODUCT IS LYING AND PROBANBLY WRITTEN BY COMPETITORS. I USED THIS LAZER EVERY WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS AND HAVE SEEN PERMANENT RESULTS AND I CONTINUE TO USE IT. THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT I CAN SAY WORKS. EVEN GOING TO 4 SESSIONS AT A PROFESSIONAL SALON ABOUT 7 YEARS AGO DIDN&#x27;T GIVE ME THESE RESULTS. I&#x27;M VERY SATISFIED!</li>
    <li> Only used it twice and I can totally tell it works. Hair is growing much slower and definitely thinner. Truth: I used it on my face. I think the reason it tells you not to is simply because of the light. I use a dark towel and cover my eyes and I&#x27;m fine. I would give it 5 stars but I wish the cartridges lasted longer or were offered in more flashes, it&#x27;s been used 4 times, twice by me and I just had to reorder cartridges. Lastly, if different cartridges were offered for permanent results... I would be all over that! I know they have the more expensive version that offers permanent results but... you know. lol</li>
    <li> It works but takes a heck of a lot of treatments.  If you have a hairy back and think this thing will make it smooth and bald, you are way off.  Great for small areas.</li>
    <li> Well to start off the review, you can not use this on your face.. This what I had actually ordered it for till I realized too late. It&#x27;s very handy and it does seem to actually work. (tried it on face anyways with success/NOT RECOMMENDED)It&#x27;s very loud when you have it running, this is due to the fact that it gets very hot. Not really a bad thing, just annoying after a while. Before you can even use it you have to put your target area (legs/arm, whatever) on the sensor and if it&#x27;s ok then it&#x27;ll turn green and your good to go. If it deems it unsafe or unable it will beep and stay locked while continuing to beep excessively. Zap a spot and wait 24 hours before you do anything, just in case you have a reaction or burn that shows up. Afterwards go at it, this thing does hurt. It&#x27;s akin to getting flicked with a rubber band while simultaneously seeing light close to the surface of the sun around the device. Keep it flush with your skin to0 minimize this, it also wont zap till its close and has a good seal around area. Don&#x27;t shock any one spot more than recomended otherwise you will pay for it later, trust me. Otherwise I&#x27;m still on my first cartridge, I&#x27;ve used it on my underarms and (face/NOT RECOMMENDED) with good results. I really like the thing just wish it was actually safe to use on/around the face, tons of warnings against this on the manual. Havnt used it on my legs yet, I&#x27;ll try that next. You can&#x27;t use this on or around your groin or by your nipples either. So this device is limited in application, keep this in mind before you buy. Otherwise enjoy.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting to become completely hairless with use of this product. What I did expect was less hair growth. My skin is pale and my hair is very dark and coarse. I have used this for one month (three treatments two weeks apart and two \\&quot;spot treatments\\&quot;). Where I used to need to shave every day, now I can go 4-5 days. Is there still hair and stubble? Yes- but you have to be pretty close to my skin to see it. I am hopeful that future treatments will hit all remaining spots but even if it doesn&#x27;t I am perfectly happy with the profound reduction of hair on my legs, bikini line and underarms</li>
    <li> You cant see the difference for the first few weeks, but you will be able to see that the amount of hair has been reduced!! I believe all my hair will be gone someday if i continue using this product!</li>
    <li> From a guy ... So i bought and received the Remington iLight Pro and a replacment cartridge about 4 months ago. I started on my abdomen, first i shaved the hairs almost down to the surface. I didn&#x27;t want to clean shave the area because then i couldn&#x27;t see what i wanted to zap. I zapped my abdomen once thru. Following directions, i waited 2 weeks and zapped again. Waited another 2 weeks and zapped again. After the first use, i bumped up the \\&quot;power level\\&quot; to five. I then zapped once a week, no stoppage. Well i am going on 4 months now, and the hairs are still growing and i have replaced the cartridge last week. I have between light and dark brown hairs on my abdomen. This thing is simply not working at all for me. There&#x27;s heat, there&#x27;s a slight pinching feeling, but no results! Am i doing something wrong? Are my hairs immune to eradication? Very frustrated at the lack of any results. Buyer beware, it just might not work at all for you. So why the 3 stars? Because Amazon delivered it timely. And the item seems to be operational. UPDATE ... July 16th ... The second cartridge just burned out. I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for months now, and the abdominal hairs have not been affected at all. They are still growing strong. I&#x27;ve used the highest setting for months. Still unsatisfied. Any advice on getting better results are welcome!</li>
    <li> I received my item May 10, 2012 and today June 18th, 2012 I can say Wow what a difference.  The hair on my armpits is atleast 80-90% gone and my bikini area 60%.  I have very dark hair and I have very fair skin.  Yes I have used it on my chin and upper lip (used eye protection and closed my eyes) and can say there is only about 15 stubborn hairs left on my chin and 100% clear on my upper lip.  I had very course and dark hair on my chin and would have to pluck every morning, but not now.  With just the few left I shave and zap them every week and they are dwindling away.  I admit that I use the highest setting and zapped sometimes twice a week. I only shave my armpits about every 5 days now and most of the time you cannot even see any hair without getting really close.  So yes I love this machine and will keep using until all hair is gone.</li>
    <li> I would have given this product, more than 3 stars, if they had included a pair of safety glasses or some kind of eye-wear because the laser light is literally blinding so you kinda lose track of where you started and how much gap to give. So I ended up going over some places more than once. Safety glasses are a must at all the laser hair removal clinics, I have gone to. Otherwise, this product worked quite well. It was virtually painless where I had shaved but stung a bit on the areas that had a bit of stubble.&lt;br /&gt;Now waiting to see the results. :)</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 3 stars because I have seen some improvement but not as good as I was expecting.  I received this as a gift in december 2011 and began using right away for my legs.  I was using it as directed only every 2 weeks for 2 months.  After 2 months, I was only seeing very minimal hair reduction but there was some reduction so I continued using.  Now I revved it up to every week and still seeing little improvement here and there.  I like that it is working but the problem is the replacement cartidges don&#x27;t last very long.  I have already had to buy 3 replacement cartidges so it works out to about one per month.  I really don&#x27;t think that I have used 1500 pulses when they go out but who&#x27;s counting?  Oh well.  Will keep chugging along and will update if anything fantastic occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and the treatment is super time consuming.  Takes me about 45 minutes to do both lower legs and hard to tell when you have done a section already.  I have had professional lazering on my bikini and had dramatic results so will keep my fingers crossed that it just takes more time with this because it is weaker.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a few months ago and have been so busy that I&#x27;ve hardly had a chance to use it. ALSO I&#x27;m a total wuss with these things, the first time I used it, i actually jumped as it flashed. Anyway I&#x27;m not really in a hurry so I wanted to test it on a small area first to see how effective it was before moving to other areas of my body that I wouldn&#x27;t usually shave. So I tried one flash on minimum setting on my arm, just one patch. 18 days later the hair hadn&#x27;t all grown back and the bit that was growing back was thinner. Quite happy with this but I know this tiny area isn&#x27;t a good enough indicator so I&#x27;ve re-shaved and re-done that area and a bit extra. Also quite a large section of my lower leg as this is more painless. I have pretty light skin and dark hair so if it&#x27;s going to work, it should work on me soon. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars for now because it was quite effective on the small area I treated, but I won&#x27;t be giving full marks until I see full results. Will update in 2 weeks!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading all the positive reviews in mid January. I am fair skinned with brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the dvd which had pretty simple instructions and made using the product easy. I have been treating my legs, underarms, and bikini area every two weeks for 3 months now. I have gone through 2 bulbs and just put on the third. I have seen little to no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now let a friend borrow every other week (made them buy their own bulb) to see if they have any success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the process, the device is simple enough to use and I thought the pain was tolerable on the highest setting. Every once in a while it will make you jump like you are popped with a rubber band and even get a slight burning hair smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, this product has been a huge waste of time and money. I will update if I see better results after using up the third bulb or if my friend sees results from using the Remington I-Light pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;FYI - You can only get a refund 90 days from the date of purchase. So if you are going to try this product out then I suggest keeping track of when your 90 days are up.&lt;br /&gt;I requested a refund through their website and that was the response I received. Good luck to all those who waste their money on this product. I have to say I think the other 1 star reviews are correct that a lot of reviews on here are FAKE.</li>
    <li> It works great. I thought it was&#x27;nt working very good after the first two sessions as the hair seemed to be still growing and I was only using setting 3 but actually it was just being pushed out like the booklet says and now 3 days before the third session it is 90% gone. I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
    <li> I purchased this IPL machine in the hopes that it would solve my hair removal problems for good. I have been using it every two weeks for probably 16 or more weeks now and the results don&#x27;t seem to be getting much better. I have patchy spots that have no hair and the rest is growing just as aggressive as ever. I think the concept definitely works since it worked in some areas, but it is not working as well as I had hoped. Would probably work for some people, but hasn&#x27;t been spectacular for me. I will keep trying and see if any improvement occurs.</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews before purchasing the iLight.  So, I was aware of some of the issues with this unit before purchase.  That said, there is one issue that I&#x27;d like to address first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bulb longevity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulb appears to be a type of bright (and hot) halogen bulb.  As a result, it needs to be cooled.  Both the base of the unit and the flash gun have fans that operate continuously while the unit is in operation.  However, the one thing I have noticed is that even while the fans operate, the flash gun gets relatively hot after a large number of successive flashes.  The instructions recommend using a grid motion down the surface of the skin leaving the unit touching the skin while pressing and holding the flash button and then moving to the next grid position.  While holding the button down to activate the flash, the unit will continually flash every few seconds while the contact sensors make contact with the surface of the skin.  After a large number of flashes, this leads the flash gun getting quite hot. I believe this is one of two problems with the unit.  Basically, the fans in the flash gun are inadequate to cool the bulb between each flash.  As the bulb remains too hot, it seems to reduce the lifespan of the bulb.  The alternative is to wait longer between flashes or flash a number of times and let the flash gun cool down before starting the next grid area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem is turning the unit off. Once done with your session for the day, it&#x27;s tempting just to flip the switch to the off position.  Don&#x27;t do this.  Let the unit sit and cool down until the unit begins beeping again.  Then, turn it off.  Letting the unit adequately cool between each session and before power off seems to increase bulb longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether we can actually get the Remington stated 1500 flashes out of the lamp is another matter, but I believe you&#x27;ll get more than a few hundred flashes by letting the unit adequately cool down both between grid treatments and before turning it completely off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I would love to say that this unit is perfect, it isn&#x27;t.  If you have course dark hair and light enough skin to activate the unit, then you may see great results.  If you have blonde, red, grey, white or thin dark or medium hair, your mileage may vary.  That means, you may not see the results you expect.  IPL does work for the proper skin type, hair color and thickness, it&#x27;s just that this is a home unit and you shouldn&#x27;t expect miracles.  It also takes several treatments to see results, so don&#x27;t expect to see anything after one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I will say for this unit is that it seems to slow hair growth in the treated areas for my skin. I don&#x27;t see the hairs falling out as promised, but I am still hopeful that with enough treatments that may still happen.  I also haven&#x27;t seen any negative effects on my skin as a result of using the unit (no burns or discoloration).  Each flash, though, feels hot for just a moment and then subsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that this is a home unit.  The [[ASIN:B005CHHO4Q Remington I-Light Pro Replacement Cartridges]] are around $20-25 each which is likely cheaper than an IPL session from a local business (and definitely cheaper than laser sessions) especially considering you can usually get at least 2.5 sessions out of one lamp cartridge.  The cartridges are also easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strength of flash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iLight allows you to adjust the strength of each flash from 1 star (default) to 5 stars.  If you have course dark hair and light skin, 1 star is probably enough.  If you have lighter hair (or deeper roots), you may need to increase the strength up to 5 stars.  As a result of increasing the strength of the flash, this likely reduces the number of flashes as well.  So, I&#x27;m thinking that the possible 1500 flashes is from a unit that is properly cooled and is using 1 star for its entire lifetime. Increasing the strength and not cooling the unit properly seems to drastically reduce bulb lifetime.  If you want to increase the bulb life, you will need to allow the unit to cool and use the least amount of flash strength needed to get the desired result.  So, you should probably start your treatments with 1 star strength and see how that goes for several sessions before increasing the strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing prior to your session&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you moisturize your skin prior to your sessions, this may help the unit work better.  The unit needs to get the light to the root of each follicle to stop its growth.  Dry skin can prevent the light from penetrating.  Moisturized skin allows the light to penetrate better.  However, don&#x27;t moisturize immediately before the start of a session.  Instead, moisturize and then wait until the lotion has dissipated and the skin is dry to the touch before starting any sessions.  You don&#x27;t want your skin to be wet with a moisturizer when beginning a session for several reasons.  First, it may cause skin reactions. Second, the lotion will smear up the lens in the flash gun (which needs to be cleaned periodically anyway) and the unclean lens will prevent the flash from working effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One additional point, while doing each session, expect the smell of burning hair.  This unit creates a very hot short flash which creates this burning smell with each flash.  So, if you don&#x27;t like this smell or don&#x27;t want to smell up your room, you might want to do your sessions outside or in a well ventilated environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m rating this unit 3 stars for a the following reasons.  First, the touted 1500 flashes from one cartridge isn&#x27;t realistic.  You can only get this number under perfect laboratory conditions.  The best I&#x27;ve been able to achieve is about 300-400 at most letting the unit cool between sessions.  Remington needs to be more realistic with the longevity of the cartridges.  Second, the unit inadequately cools the flash lamp leading to early lamp failure based on Remington&#x27;s suggested usage. Remington has a great idea, but it&#x27;s executed in a mediocre way.  If it had been more thoughtfully designed, I would give this unit more stars.  That said, it is a home unit, so you can&#x27;t expect perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this unit doesn&#x27;t work or isn&#x27;t effective.  It does work.  But, its effectiveness is limited by the type and thickness of the hair. Note that there is another technique which can be used with the iLight (IPL) that may make it twice as effective even on blond, red or white hair follicles.  I am going to try this technique and report back.  If this technique works, I will raise the star rating on this unit and include this technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: 5/3/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have another problem that just surfaced today.  The cord connecting the flash gun to the base now has a broken cable inside it.  When the thick cable is moved into a certain position, the flash gun loses power.  The gun must now be moved into specific positions for the wire to make contact. Once a broken cable happens, it&#x27;s will only get worse. This is clearly a warranty problem at this point, but it also shows that this unit is definitely not that well made.  I have only used the iLight 8-10 times since I&#x27;ve gotten it and I&#x27;m not rough with it at all.  There is no reason that cable should be this fragile. What I would suggest to Remington is to use a cable that is removable on both ends (from the handle and from the base).  If the cable dies, you don&#x27;t have to replace the whole unit.  On this unit, the cable that wires the flash gun is permanently anchored to both the gun and the base.  So, there&#x27;s no way to replace the gun or the cable.trength and not cooling the unit properly seems to drastically reduce bulb lifetime.  If you want to increase the bulb life, you will need to allow the unit to cool and use the least amount of flash strength needed to get the desired result.

    <li> I used the Remington Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System two times and the light cartridge is already dead. I hope that is not the normal life span of the cartridge, if so... it was very poor.</li>
    <li> I like it.but I didn&#x27;t know the price will change.I thought it&#x27;s price is Canadian dollars but after currency exchange, it became more expensive. I&#x27;m just not happy about the price.</li>
    <li> The cartridge only gave me fifty flashes before flashing that it needs a new one. So far I have not seen results and I&#x27;m light skinned with dark hair.</li>
    <li> works just like at the salons but in the privacy of my own home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very pleased with the results and I&#x27;ve used it twice in stubborn areas that&lt;br /&gt;hair grew back after salon laser treatment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews but I think this is necessary. I&#x27;ve struggled with unwanted hair on my face for years. Shaving, plucking all leaves terrible marks on my chin, jawline and neck. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars for laser treatments but non seem to last. I&#x27;m not saying that this product makes the hair goes away forever but at least you will have it available for touch ups. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month and I literally have to search where I may missed a spot on my face. Even my husband noticed a difference within two weeks. At first I started using it every other day or so for the first week. Then every four days now once a week. It hurts like a bitch BUT totally worth it (I usually have a drink to relax). If your suffering from unwanted hair please please invest in this product. Also make sure your complexion is not as dark as the hair. I have yellow base complexion and thick dark hair so this was perfect. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I used it and then I was going to return it because I thought it wasn&#x27;t working. It took a couple of weeks for the hair to finally start falling out but once it did, I was very impressed with the results.  I bought it so I could do my full bikini area. It hurts, but I still kept it on the highest setting. I will continue to use it every two weeks until I&#x27;m hair free!</li>
    <li> Hate this item.  Cannot use on face.  Find this out AFTER we buy it.  Wasted our money.</li>
    <li> I wish I had saved the money and put it towards professional hair removal. The Remington light pro did not deliver the results which I was hoping for. I followed all instructions and areas being treated were light skinned with dark hair. It took at least 8 treatments (I lost count) to see any difference at all in hair regrowth. It did SLOW the regrowth process but by no means did it last even close to 6 months. After the first 6-8 treatments I notice regrowth rate was slower and sparse.  After taking a break from treatments the results lasted only bout 4 weeks and I had to start all over. It does \\&quot;sort of\\&quot; work. There seems to be a bit less hair in the treated areas but not enough to recommend the light pro.</li>
    <li> Maybe I have a high tolerance for pain..but I started at the highest level and it does feel like being snapped with a rubber band, but nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had it for a week and I can already feel the diference. I do exoliate every 48 hrs and it helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please read the instructions carefully. I bougth a replacement cartdrige, Im going into my 5th treatment and Im still using the one that came with the machine. Im olive skin with dark hair and have no problem unlocking it. Im very satisfied with my results and can wait to see the end results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions before using it!!!</li>
    <li> A couple months ago I would have said this was a bust. I ran out of pulses on my last cartridge with half a calf to go and based on what I&#x27;d seen I decided not buy another refill and call it a day. I got busy and sort of forgot about the whole thing, but I didn&#x27;t shave for quite a while. When I finally paid attention there was a very distinct line on the calf that I&#x27;d half finished weeks earlier. My usual growth was back where I hadn&#x27;t treated and the other half of my leg had only sparse hairs here and there. So I ordered two more cartridges today. It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing quite as well on my underarms, but they were pretty sparse to begin with and it only takes a minute to keep trying with those. It&#x27;s actually doing a great job of maintaining my bikini line, which I had zapped professionally about a year ago. It&#x27;s worth it for that alone. It hurts a little bit, but as a 10-year epilator I&#x27;m up for it. I&#x27;m giving it three stars for the cost of the cartridges and because the little window is so small that it takes forever to do both your legs. Grab a movie on Prime, because you&#x27;ll be there a while. I&#x27;m pretty fair, with light brown hair, but my leg hair it quite dark so I know I&#x27;m a good candidate, but I can honestly say it is working for me.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, but takes time</li>
    <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t function right out of the box. I spent an absiolutely unacceptable amount of time on the phone with their customer service to learn that I recieved a defective unit. So obviously they have little or no quality control on this chinese made product. So I get to wait a week for them to send me a return authorization, then wait another week for them to recieve this piece of junk before they will ship a replacement. If I ever do get a functioning unit I will post an updated review. As of now I give the product a big thumbs down.</li>
    <li> I had my legs, underarms and upper-lip professionally lasered 4 years ago, so I know how painful salon lasering is. It took 18 treatments (every 6 weeks) over a 2 year period at a cost of around $4000, which was also painful, but it was worth every penny and all of the excrutiating pain (I am not kidding - every pulse felt like someone had pulled back a large rubber band as far as it could go and then let it snap). I wore yoga pants for two days after each session because my skin was tender and swollen and felt like it was badly sunburnt, but the results were absolutely worth it! About a year ago I started epilating my hairy arms and wishing that I had had them done at the same time as my legs, and now that the Brazilian wax is the thing to do, I wish I had had my whole bikini area done, although I don&#x27;t know if I could tolerate that pain, honestly. I also have to pull anywhere from 20 to 70 hairs a DAY from my chin, and it has gotten so bad that I decided to give the Light Pro a shot. It is less than the cost of one session, so I figured that it was worth the risk of it not working.  Let me say that I am fair-skinned and very dark-haired, so I am the ideal candidate for laser. I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily presume that this works as well for lighter-haired people. My hair grows extraordinarily fast - I was epilating my arms every 5 days and I have already stated that my little black chin-whiskers were popping up daily. This does say not to use on the face, but I figured that if the salon could do it then so could I so I disregarded the warning, and it has been fine except for a few bumps the next day that go away in a few days.   I got the Light Pro about 3 weeks ago and used it immediately. I used the highest setting (which I would recommend, as you get 1000 flashes per bulb regardless of the intensity that you use, so you might as well be as effective as possible)and overlapped even though it says not to. The pain is only a fraction of the salon laser, so I was pretty skeptical as to its effectiveness, but I still kept at it. Rather than wait two weeks as the instructions tell you, I waited two days and did it again, and then I epilated, since my hairs were so long at that point that I had to wear long sleeves. I waited about a week and then treated all areas again, although I did not see any improvement at this point and fully expected that before the month was up I would be packing it up and trying to get Amazon to refund my $250. A week and a day later I started on my 3rd treatment. I finished my chin and arms and was a few pulses into my bikini area when the thing started beeping and stopped delivering pulses. I re-read the manual and realized that my cartridge was used up, which kind of pissed me off because it claimed to have enough flashes to cover the entire body for 3 sessions, and I had only gotten 2 and a half of just my chin, arms, and bikini area, but I did overlap to cover every centimeter of the skin I was treating, so...  I discovered that another cartridge would cost $25, and decided not to waste any more $ on this project when it occurred to me that my bikini area is now very patchy. It is definitely at least 30% less dense. It also occurred to me that I hadn&#x27;t pulled more than 10 or 15 hairs from my chin in a single day in the past week. Hmmm...maybe I should hold off on the refund thing. I epilated my arms that night (Wed), and it is now Sunday night and my hair growth is barely noticible, and what has grown back is very fine and thin. So I ordered another cartridge this morning, because at this rate I believe that I will have hair-free arms and a hair free bikini area by summer, although it may take two more cartridges. Still, the machine plus 2 cartridges is still about $85 less than a single session at the salon, so it is WELL worth the cost!   To sum it up, don&#x27;t be discouraged because you don&#x27;t see immediate results. Give it two treatments and I thing you will notice significant changes in your hair growthand density, but do expect that it will cost you a few $25 cartridges along with the initial cost of the machine, especially if you are doing your legs.</li>
    <li> ***Update #1 (04/23/2012)********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used my i-light pro to treat my legs, bikini area and underarms 3 times. Despite the advice on the box, I have used it to treat my chin 5 to 6 times. I am very happy with the results. I am not seeing 100% results but I did not expect them. I would say that I have approx 50% less hair growth on my legs and 75% less hair under my arms. As for my chin, I believe that the hair in this area is very resistant (I have had it treated professionally several times also). I definitely see hair loss on my chin but I would like it to be more. The hairs that do grow back seem to be more fine and grow at a slower rate. I work in an operating room and the temperature is very cold. I shave my legs every day but once I get to work I get goosebumps from the cold and it immediately feels like I need to shave again. I have not noticed this feeling as much since I have been using the i-light pro. Sounds silly but that is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the machine at the highest pulse level with minimal discomfort. I do notice that I am more sensitive (more uncomfortable) approx 1 week before my menstrual cycle. I learned that this is true from the nurse who performed the professional treatments on me in the office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned I have used the product multiple times. I have NOT had to replace the cartridge yet. I anticipate that I will need to change it very soon. I have not had any problems with using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the storage of the unit. The cords are very long (which I like) but there is no easy way to coil them up and store it in the box it originally came in. Not that big of a deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Original review (01/30/2012)********************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a mailing from my local Ulta store which advertised this product. I went online to research this product and noticed that it was relatively new....so I was hesitant to purchase it without anything to base my opinion on and because of the price. I have had professional laser treatments many times in the past for my underarms, bikini area and chin. I have had amazing results with those treatments but as many of you are aware...the expense of professional treatments is not cheap. I have desperately been wanting to treat my legs for years. I bought the Remington i-Light Pro 2 weeks ago (Ulta had a 20% off coupon...so I was able to purchase this product for $200 instead of $250).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use and has easy to understand instructions. The product was carefully designed to keep safety as the #1 priority. I did not experience any problems with the machine as other users have described. Professional laser treatments can be very uncomfortable depending on the location and sensitivity of the area being treated. After using the i-Light Pro, it would be safe to say that the level of discomfort is nowhere near as significant as professional treatments. I used the highest setting for my treatments. This is probably because professional machines have higher levels of laser penetration...therefore, higher level of results. Products for home use will never deliver professional results or intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 1 1/2 weeks since my first treatment. I treated both of my legs (whole leg) and bikini area. I did not have to replace the cartridge. I have to admit that I have noticed results. I have taken tweezers and noticed that I have hairs that are coming out without the need to \\&quot;tug\\&quot; on the hair as you normally would using tweezers...it basically just falls out without any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to using the i-Light Pro in the future and hope that it will reduce my hair growth significantly. One thing to keep in mind when purchasing products like this or having professional treatments....HAIR WILL ALWAYS GROW BACK no matter what you are promised. My professional treatments had amazing results, it has been approx 6 years since I had my underarms treated. When my treatments were complete, I probably had 5 to 6 hairs that continued to grow (which I just plucked instead of shaving)...since then I now have probably 50 to 60 hairs that grow. The hairs that were treated did not come back, new hairs have appeared. This is due to hormonal changes...amongst many other reasons (ie. medications).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering I have only completed one treatment, I am very happy with my results. The price of the machine itself is less than one professional treatment. It is worth a shot. Even if this machine only provides me with 50% reduction of hair growth, I would say it was worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post updates to my review periodically to keep you posted.</li>
    <li> I have had mine for about two months and due to being very busy, I have only been able to use it twice, since this will take you an hour to use on the legs alone, I have not had time. The first use, I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing. I shaved right before using it, which I think is a mistake. The second time, I shaved the night before I used it and got FABULOUS results within a couple of weeks. It stings a lot more when you let a day pass between shaving and lasering, but since the hair is starting to grow back within 24 hours of shaving, this guarantees you catch your hair in the all-important \\&quot;growing\\&quot; phase. I have only used my device on level 4, which gives you a little sting, but is a tolerable level for most people with very light skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m proud to say that I have patches on my calves with absolutely no hair growing at all and spots where the hair is extremely fine and light in color now. I wonder how long these results will actually last? Could some of it be permanent? I hope so. As a precaution, I purchased some laser protection glasses from Amazon prior to using this. I understand the materials that come with it do not mention laser protection glasses, but if they don&#x27;t want you using this on your face, it&#x27;s likely that is because of the laser around the fan would shine in your eyes and destroy your vision. If you&#x27;ve ever been to a medical spa, they always put laser protection glasses on you no matter where they are lasering, so I suggest you protect your vision and get you some glasses, to be sure. Hair removal would not be worth endangering your vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to many more treatments and the continual reduction in hair. I can already tell my razors are lasting longer since they have a lot less stubble to shave. The only difficulty I will have is trying to figure out where to zap. They tell you NOT to draw a grid pattern on your legs, so it&#x27;s very hard to tell where you need to zap and where you don&#x27;t. I guess I just have to keep zapping around until I get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: May 28, 2012***&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this for a couple of months to see what would happen and guess what? All of the hair came back. I know the box says, \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; results, but I thought at least some of it would not come back. I still highly recommend the product and plan to resume my usage of it, but just know that this is something you will have to maintain and it definitely DOES NOT produce permanent hair removal. The results are exactly what they say, &#x27;temporary&#x27;, but long enough to make it worth doing, if you don&#x27;t mind the expense and don&#x27;t want to go the route of permanent removal.p zapping around until I get it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: May 28, 2012***&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this for a couple of months to see what would happen and guess what?

    <li> I absolutely love this product!!  I have only used it one time, but can already see a reduction in hair growth.  I used the product on five stars and it wasn&#x27;t painful, but rather uncomfortable on certain areas.  My underarms were the worst.  My hair grows very quickly.  If I shave in the morning I will usually have to shave again at night if I plan on going out.  I shaved yesterday morning, used the Remington IPL, and woke up this morning with my legs still relatively smooth.  AMAZING!!!  It will continue to update as time progresses and I use the product more.</li>
    <li> I would give it 5 stars BUT I have only been using it for almost two weeks but havin great results.&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am very fair and have VERY dark hair so I was an ideal candidate if it was to work they way it stated. I don&#x27;t recommend to anyone to use it the way I have but after reading some other reviews, I figured I would chance it at my own risk.&lt;br /&gt;1- I used on my face, this is the primary reason I purchsed&lt;br /&gt;2- Used on HIGH every 3-4 days&lt;br /&gt;Since I can rememeber I have always had a issue with facial hair but recently around my chin has got really bad. I have done bleaching, waxing, shaving, threading, but always went back to waxing/tweezers (and on my own because to embarrased to go to a salon) because of the dark, thick hair I HAVE to pull out daily. I always have the area red, inflamed or something going on because of the tweezing. Very embarrasing and makes me very self concious. So, I prepped myself as instructions said to follow but I used it like I mentioned above. The zapping didn&#x27;t bother me until I got to my chin and since the skin was tender and red, it stung but nothing worse than WAXING.&lt;br /&gt;The hair growth has slown down, I would say by 50% and the hairs slide out or I can squeeze them out. I still pluck everyday but they are not as coarse and difficult to remove so my skin is actually HEALING! Hopefully the red will completely be gone for the first time in forever with no visible hair.&lt;br /&gt;For ppl who haven&#x27;t really felt the pain of being a woman with these issues and hiding this super embarrasing problem and squeamish of pain, I don&#x27;t recommend but for the rest of us who have struggled with this... I totally recommend. I feel so much better about myself and having people look at me directly in the face and even in the SUN.&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a few months and hopefully have even a better experience.&lt;br /&gt;--- Also no isues with my cartridge so far</li>
    <li> Update match 23&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 months since first treatment. So far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Legs: right leg 4 treatments, left untouched until yesterday. Difference is big between both. I would say about 60/70% reduction on treated leg, much smoother, no signs of regrowth at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Underarm: 5 treatments. Hair is almost gone, 90% reduction and feeling super good and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chest: 5 treatments. very smooth, 70/80% gone, some thick hairs seemed not wanting to go so I epilated and treat them when they start growing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belly: 5 sessions. around 60% reduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazilian: 5sessions, amazing. Almost hairless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m amazed with results. At this point still experimenting and learning effects on each body part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started my 4th bulb, ordered another 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have the idea that this machine is perfect to combine with other hair removal methods in cycles: epilate, shave, couple of treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machine is very good, very surprised by results after just first 2/3 weeks. Only minus is light life, I had to change it half way second treatment, I&#x27;m sure didn&#x27;t do even 1,000 flashes, could be life is shorter when using at max power?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m male and hairy. I&#x27;ve done epilating, shaving, waxing in the past, I think this machine is perfect to combine with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m doing underarm, chest, belly, Brazilian, full legs. Best results on chest and Brazilian (more than half less hair), other areas maybe about 40% reduction. Skin suffers a lot less now than precious using other removal methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the buy</li>
    <li> So far so good! Honest review here!&lt;br /&gt;I have medium/light skin tone and dark thick hair. Sadly, facial hair from shaving peach fuzz when I was a teen and I have been struggling with this for awhile. Shaving was not doing it for me anymore, leaving stubble and rash. This Product changed my life! No lie! I was very hesitant to buy and spend money having the mindset that it is too good to be true that it would work but I decided I had to try! As a women with facial hair it is not fun and so far my hair is gone, growing a lot slower and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to do one treatment every two weeks for the first month and I did it every week (my hair grows so fast) and it worked for me. I use highest power and at first I was scared but it really doesn&#x27;t hurt, just a second sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone looking to remove unwanted hair!</li>
    <li> This relies on disposable light inserts which are supposed to provide a set number of flashes to discourage hair growth; the cartridges i got did not last even one session each - i certainly didn&#x27;t count them but they were really inferior products. The device might still &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; but I can&#x27;t deal with such a bad product. I wish that I had sent it back immediately - but procrastinated. Don&#x27;t bother. Whomever now owns the Remington name has no shame.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to let you guys know that most of the reviews for this product (except for a few) are FAKE and done by Remington to promote their products. I&#x27;ve used this product before and I can tell you it works to a certain extent. However, the pain (it stings!) is not worth the results. The results are temporary and don&#x27;t last the promised 6 months. Also, the bulbs die prematurely. I should know... I&#x27;ve gone through 7 bulbs in the for 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the reviews here are 5-star reviews by people who 1) never bought the item 2) have used it once or twice. If you look carefully at the reviews, almost all of the 4 to 5-star reviews are from people who have NEVER written an Amazon review in their life. I fall into that category, but I am so fed up by the # of false reviews for this product that I feel I have to speak up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my 2 cents. Take my review for what it&#x27;s worth, but I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree with me if you do your own research. I&#x27;m sure Remington will try to defend the 4/5 reviews they&#x27;ve paid people to write, by commenting on this review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the i-light for two sessions now (two weeks apart).  One of the common complaints is that the light burns out a lot faster than is advertised.  I counted the number of \\&quot;flashes\\&quot; I got each time I used it.  The total was 973 before the light saying I needed a new bulb came on.  They advertise 1000-1500, so this was pretty close.  But... this still only covered 2 treatments of my underarms, lower legs, and biking line.  I&#x27;m ordering a new bulb right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of effectiveness, I used the product on my underarms, legs, and bikini line for hair removal (as stated above).  I have yet to see results in terms of reduction in hair growth, but will update in two weeks again.  I also recently had an IPL (pulse light) process done on my face to reduce the number of freckles I have.  I was told I would need to come back for spot treatment.  I used the i-light on my face to see if it would \\&quot;spot treat\\&quot; my remaining malasma/freckles.  You&#x27;re not *supposed* to use it on your face, but I decided to give it a go anyway.  I will update if I see results.  Also, I have had laser treatment for spider veins.  I have been triple zapping my remaining spider veins with the i-light and, again, will update if I see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... to sum up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Bulb life seems to be as advertised&lt;br /&gt;No pain with use&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on the face (though you are not supposed to use it there)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to see any reduction in hair growth (after 2 weeks)... (the product says it will take more time to see results.  I will update as I progress.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give three stars so far, because I have yet to see any reduction in hair growth.  Again, it has only been two weeks, so I will update if I do, in fact, see results after I order another bulb.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m refraining from a 5 star review for 2 simple reasons: only when my treatments have been completed and I can assess the long-term results will I be able to definitely give it an extra star or not. And secondly, as other reviews have noted, the IPL cartridge that comes with the I-Light Pro appears to be defective for a significant number of buyers, including me. Mine just died today well well short of the 1500 zaps promised, I intend to contact Remington about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting that aside, on to the review. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I have been compelled to write a review so early, and so enthusiastically! When it comes to hair removal products, feeling enthusiastic about any one of the thousands out there is very rare indeed. As someone who bought the Tria a year ago for the ridiculous price of $495 with very high hopes and expectations, my experience with that product was abhorrent. I gave it a 1 star review due to its terrible flaws and for the simple fact that it did not work for me AT ALL. If I could give it a 0 I would. After the endless hours invested and multiple treatments I had nothing to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had several salon IPL sessions done on my chest and stomach in 2005 which cost me something like $1200. I decided to stop the treatments due to this high cost and because at that point I was satisfied enough with the results I got which were impressive: at least a 60-65% reduction in hair which throughout the years since has remained permanent. So I begin my treatments with the experience of having had IPL treatments done in the past and with less than half the hair I had naturally. I completed my first session the day after I received the I-light Pro, and I used the highest setting from the start (which I recommend, unless your pain tolerance is very low). The pain was quite reminiscent of the salon treatments I had, which I took as a good sign--if you feel nothing when you zap that means you either have no hair in the area or thehair is too fine for the follicle to absorb the light and be killed. Over time, as you lose hair (too soon to make any conclusions about long term permanence) treatments will be far less painful as there is less hair to zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless having the Tria experience in mind I didn&#x27;t let myself get too happy since those treatments were also painful but in the end nothing happened. Immediately and in the days after the treatment nothing looked different, the hair began to grow like after any shave--this is normal. It was on or about the ten-day mark that something remarkable happened: after taking off a t-shirt I noticed on the inside tons of little hairs! This was exactly what happened to the hair after the salon treatments at $250 a pop. The dead hair gets ejected from your skin. It&#x27;s working! At the 2 week mark, I can see new bald spots where those little hairs have fallen out. I can confidently say that after a single treatment close to 20% of the hair on my chest and stomach has disappeared and another large percentage of hairs have thinned out (or perhaps the new spareness giving that illusion.) I am simply in awe of this product. The price, the ergonomics (mostly), the larger zap area, the convenience and ultimately the results make this in my opinion the holy grail of at home laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately 1/4 of the way into my second treatment the IPL cartridge gave in, so I would hope Remington starts to impose some quality control on these cartridges. If you want close to hair free results, it will take more than 3 treatments--it could take up to 6 or 8 or even 10 depending on an individual&#x27;s hair. But that is okay. This product works, and is far faster and efficient in covering all your areas. I never imagined back when I was doing salon treatments that one day I could buy my own machine for less the price of one session and do it myself with actual results. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/24/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completely forgot abouthaving written this review so I didn&#x27;t get the chance to update based on further usage. So after using the product several more times, including a long months-long pause (I went on vacation and got a deep tan) and then once again doing about 2 more sessions after re-starting I&#x27;m going to have to lower my review by one star. I had higher hopes for the product but in the end it&#x27;s quite clear that this is not a permanent solution. What it is though, is a very effective temporary reduction solution. In my experience I would have to say that you could do 10 sessions to the T and you will still not get *permanent* hair loss results--what it will do is put a huge amount of your hair follicles in some kind of dormant mode--and I&#x27;ll gladly say that this is a decent outcome. The results can last for months and months. You will have so much less hair for such a long time that any grooming you may have to do will be significantly reduced. So in the end, this product is a disappointment in one respect (expecting salon laser-like permanent results) but on the other hand I wouldn&#x27;t characterize its temporary results as a waste of time either, since the temporary nature of the results actually do last a long time--which makes shaving whatever is left a breeze until you see that you need a maintenance session to put the hair to sleep once again. It is still a much much much better value for money than the piece of garbage that is the TRIA. One word of advice that bears repeating: use it on the highest setting from the start. Using the lower settings becomes that much more of a waste considering there&#x27;s no permanent loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that over the next few years Remington or other companies will improve these systems by increasing the longevity of the cartridges, reduction of noise and heat, larger zap area, and most important of all increase the energy output of the light/laser in order to cause permanent hair loss.</li>
    <li> I have used this produce twice now and I can see a definite decrease in the amount of hair on the areas I&#x27;ve used it on. It hurts much worse in sensitive areas like the bikini area and the underarms, so I haven&#x27;t used it as much in those areas as I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s virtually painless on the legs. It&#x27;s not a miracle, I still have to shave, but if hair is an actual \\&quot;problem\\&quot; for you - this product is relatively inexpensive for the results you get and and does help.</li>
    <li> So I bought this item to do my bikini line and I used it way more frequently than you even need to use it for about 3 months. At first my hair was only growing back in patches and I thought it was working. Now after 6 months I&#x27;m testing it by not shaving or using the system and it&#x27;s growing back just like it was before. This system is a scam. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> So I performed my first treatment and everything went well until.... I have two tattoos, one on my right ankle and the other on the top of my left foot. It states in the instructions; which I read thoroughly, that it is to be used on light skin, which I have. It does not however, say anything about tattoos. I used this not thinking my tattoos would be an issue and burned the crud out of myself on each tattoo. The burns are so bad that the one on my right ankle actually is the shape of the light window, raised and is very painful and the one on my left foot is just a huge blister. Long story short, please do not let this info stop you from buying the product, I am just writing to make sure the information is out there for people like myself who research an item before purchasing so you know exactly what you are buying and that if you have a ton of tattoos, you save your money on this product. The product so far seems to be doing what it is supposed to, though it has only been one day, and overall I am happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I also used it on my face and just closed my eyes when I zapped so the light was not directly in my eyes. It worked just like the rest of my body so I will be continuing treating my face as well. Overall, this product seems to work and I am happy with it, it is not painful as long as you shave before using like the instructions also state. Good luck, i hope it works for all who buy it.</li>
    <li> cheked out ok to ues followes direction with great results seems to last well so far pain free good dealer</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this working, with the negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one of these refurb from another site, but know I depend on Amazon reviews, so told myself no matter what, I would write a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of background:&lt;br /&gt;I am Asian-American with olive toned skin. Light, but not white. I tan very dark in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is dark-brown almost black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grow very little hair anywhere except on top of my head/ on my face where you would expect, on my underarms, and in the bikini area where you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;Problem, I also grow a very coarse patch on my chin, thinner on my neck, and a few coarse bits on my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;That hair irritates my skin, and I break out near/ in it.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving also irritates it/ makes ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Experiment:&lt;br /&gt;I decided, if it works, I was willing to let it take the extra time, and since my chin grows the same amount on each side, neck too, that I would only use it on one side and shave/ pluck like I normally do on the other side. Areas: Chin, neck, upper lip, underarms.&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions to clean, shave, etc the areas to be zapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1:&lt;br /&gt;Could only zap my chin on 1-2, was a bit freaked at the snapping and flashing.&lt;br /&gt;Underarm: not even a tickle, even on the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;Smelled a mild scent of burning hair, which happened each time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1-2:&lt;br /&gt;I did not wait the time limit, and zapped my chin every 3-4 days for 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Zapped underarms 1/week.&lt;br /&gt;Was not sure I saw anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 3-4:&lt;br /&gt;By now zapping full strength on chin and neck and underarm.&lt;br /&gt;Zapping of chin was 1-2/ week, underarms 1/ week.&lt;br /&gt;Definite change in the chin, not as much in the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 6:&lt;br /&gt;Continue the pattern of zapping frequency&lt;br /&gt;Chin on the zapped side is 95% no hair. I went without shaving/ doing anything for 4 days to either side.&lt;br /&gt;The few hairs on the zapped side are from where there are contours, and probably missed due to the small zapping window.&lt;br /&gt;Underarm: Maybe 50% less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 7-10:&lt;br /&gt;Stepped up the underarm to every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;Chin is pretty well clear except for stragglers here and there.&lt;br /&gt;Underarm showing definite difference from other side, now.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts are pretty much gone from my face near the zapped areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;None of the Cons below are deal breakers in the least. I gave it 4 stars only because per instructions, it was not working quite as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works.&lt;br /&gt;Can do it at home&lt;br /&gt;Is convenient&lt;br /&gt;is quick.&lt;br /&gt;Long, heavy cord.&lt;br /&gt;AC cord is generously long&lt;br /&gt;Hand held unit is nice sized for a small hand.&lt;br /&gt;No more shaving, stubble, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;skin sensor&amp;#34; to unlock it is supposed to be used each time, apparently on the place you want to zap.

The whole head is not the zapper, but a small window on the head. Not that bit of an issue: just go over those the next time. Eventually they will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I have not tested:&lt;br /&gt;I used it only on a small area, less than 25 zaps per session. I have no way to advise on the longevity of the bulb.&lt;br /&gt;Long term, I do not know if the hair will regrow. It&#x27;s now been 4 months and seems ok, though.

    <li> Overall hair re-growth is markedly sparser after 3 treatments.  Areas of treatment: legs, underarms, bikini, chin, and upper lip.  Looking forward to seeing continued eradication of unwanted hair.  I highly recommend the Remington I-Light Pro to anyone who struggles with unwanted hair.  Do keep in mind that results are not immediately noticeable so lots of patience is required.  Be sure to wait at least 1 week between treatments and brace yourself for a bit of pain.  A couple of Advils 20 minutes before treatment is helpful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy GUY and started shaving and epilating my body hair as soon as I started getting it.  Since I let it all grow back, I&#x27;ve had years and years of persistent in-grown hair issues - and I&#x27;m tired of all the scarring.  So, I started shaving and started using this product to end all this nonsense, but on a budget (yes, it&#x27;s an expensive investment, but better than professional treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I write this (5/12/12), it&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;ve treated my upper legs and upper arms for the first time, and I must say that I see results.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any hairs falling out on my legs yet, but the hair is definitely growing a lot more slowly.  I&#x27;d have a \\&quot;five o&#x27;clock shadow\\&quot; on my legs the day I shaved, but they were still pretty smooth the day after.  Even now, the hair is much shorter than it should be if I hadn&#x27;t zapped it with the IPL.  The hair IS still there, though, and you can definitely see the little black spots under the skin.  Hopefully those will go away completely when the hair falls out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My upper arms are showing a lot more improvement.  The growth is also a lot slower, but some hairs have actually fallen out.  Kind of patchy, even though I&#x27;m sure I got good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update if I see any significant improvement.</li>
    <li> I returned the product before using as the information sheet&lt;br /&gt;contained too many references to pain.  Didn&#x27;t think I would&lt;br /&gt;use it more than once and couldn&#x27;t risk the investment.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my arms and legs but i really didnt like this product.</li>
    <li> I received the system brand new in a sealed box and bag and only got to use it for a few minutes because it has a light on the unit that came on after a minute and then the nit stopped working and said that it needed a new light cartridge,  I could have waited for customer service to send me a new one but I didn&#x27;t want to end up stuck with a defective machine.  I can&#x27;t  tell you if it works effectively or not but I can tell you for the few zaps that I received it is a feeling similar to real laser hair removal but less intense.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have used this for a couple years now, and remember that it really took several months for the effects to be clear in the beginning. I had to use some strong exfoliating products to deal with my skin at first. However, I continued to use this regularly, and now have had such great results that I continue with only touch up treatments. I&#x27;ve had greatly reduced hair growth in the treated areas and I would highly recommend this to anyone with some patience.</li>
    <li> Holy cow... thank you Remington for putting out yet another stellar product!  I am Irish with (very) white skin and dark auburn hair, and the Light Pro does wonders for me.  I&#x27;m using it on my legs, bikini, under arm... you name it. This product is clearly well-made: various different strength settings (does anyone use anything but the highest? maybe good for the faint of heart), a long power cord, a long wand cord, and a skin tester to &amp;#34;unlock&amp;#34; the tool to verify you are using it on the correct skin tones. Remember when using, you need to be vigilant!  The tool covers about a 1cmm area of skin at a time (similar to professional tools), so you have to move it very little when in use from one section to the next. But even still, I find I can use it very quickly. Love it, hope to be hair free by summer!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my I-Light Pro laser! I originally bought it for facial hair, after I received it I read the directions said not to use on the face. I was disappointed but decided to try it on my face anyways. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I protect my eyes with UV glasses and my facial hair is now gone. I do touch up every few weeks, but it is so nice not to have to pluck every day! I also use it on the brown areas on my forehead and they are fading and much less noticeable! I absolutely love this little laser!</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product but the bulb goes very fast</li>
    <li> I have had 10-12 professional laser treatments on my legs(full leg and bikini) which cost a good deal and have had pretty decent results considering what I started out with. It used to take me 15 minutes to shave my full legs and the tub would be covered with hair. Now i can shave 2-3xweek and the hair is finer. I am by no means hairless after all those professional treatments. hair growth is dependent on genetics and follicle sensitivity to testosterone/DHT in both men and women. Hormone levels will fluctuate throughout your lifetime and theses changes can reactivate hair follicles and start producing dark hair again. The only way to prevent hair regrowth after treatments is to take MEDICATIONS which block DHT like propecia or spironolactone or bith control pills. I took spiro for 6 months and did laser and had amazing results but drugs have side effects so off the drugs, hair comes back. The ONLY form of permanent hair removal to date is electrolysis and even that can take a year/years and is not good for large areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with the Remington is similar to professional laser treatments:the results from the highest setting on the device yield the same results as the lower settings on professional laser. About 1 in 5 hairs falls out about 2 weeks later. It takes that long for the hair to fall out. Some dark freckles on my arm burned and came off(this is also how they remove dark skin discoloration and tattoos so beware if you want to keep those cute little dark spots). I did use it on my chin and the skin blistered a bit in one area but is healed now. I expect that with more frequent use I will have decent results. The cartridge burns out quickly, especially since I go over the same area multiple times but at 20 bucks a pop, even if if I use 2/month is STILL cheaper than professional laser. The settings that worked for professional laser were incredibly painful. The same pain was felt with the remington only in my underarms where the hair is dark,thick and the skin is lighter and thinner. Good luck all.</li>
    <li> Sigh - the product does seem to work although if you have visions of smooth as silk skin and never shaving again, that&#x27;s probably unrealistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially pleased that there seemed to be significantly less underarm hair (although some pesky hairs kept coming back)...  but now I am not happy because I sweat significantly more.  I wasn&#x27;t sure it was from the laser treatments (it is summer, after all), but there does seem to be some data that link these together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axillary hair removal with 1064-nm Nd:YAG laser increases sweat production.&lt;br /&gt;Aydin F, Pancar GS, Senturk N, Bek Y, Yuksel EP, Canturk T, Turanli AY.&lt;br /&gt;Clin Exp Dermatol. 2010 Aug;35(6):588-92. Epub 2009 Oct 23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Novel adverse effects of laser-assisted axillary hair removal].&lt;br /&gt;Hélou J, Soutou B, Jamous R, Tomb R.&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;Hyperhidrosis, bromhidrosis and leukotrichia are likely new adverse effects of laser-assisted axillary hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to let people know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/2013:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I upped the stars.  I still think its possible that I sweat more, but it&#x27;s not really that big a deal- maybe the effect was temporary, or it&#x27;s small enough that I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of hair loss, I have significantly less hair than before.  The underarm hair is very fine, does not grow that long, and only seems to grow in a few fine patches.  I have a theory that the remaining hairs are related to skin pigment.  In terms of legs, also significantly less hair.  I can get away with not shaving at all....  The skin does not feel totally smooth, but you can&#x27;t see any hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I think it was worth it.</li>
    <li> With as much as it cost, I definitely had high expectations for this thing. I bought the actual system along with a refill cartridge, but unlike some other people have stated, the cartridge the system came with lasted for quite a long time. I followed the directions and about a week later I started noticing a difference. I&#x27;ve used it several times since I got it, and the amount of hair growing back on my legs is noticeably less. I will say, though, that I have a lot of difficulty using it under my arms because, even on the lowest setting, it hurts soo much.</li>
    <li> Fabulaous. Works great. I no longer have underarm hair after only one month of using the product. I have touched up  other areas. I would have spent so much more at a salon. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item with high hopes in May but returned it when I did not see noticeable results after three treatments.  I have the ideal skin tone/hair color.  I was terribly disappointed but after reading more reviews decided to try it again with the hope that I will see results, just maybe not in 3 treatments.  I HATE hair removal and if this can extend the frequency between shaves, I will be happy.  I normally see stubble the day after I shave.  I intend to use this on my legs; if it goes well I will use on my underarm area.  I am giving the product three stars based on the quality (it seems very well made), the ease of use (I found it to be extremely easy if you follow the instructions) and the fact that even on the highest setting, it hurts so much less than epilators.  I will update in a few months with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  After three uses spaced two weeks apart as directed, I am noticing a difference.  There is approximately 25-30% reduction in growth and regrowth is noticeably slower.  Usually I have some stubble the day after shaving; now stubble isn&#x27;t really noticeable for two or three days.  I think these results will improve in time.  So at this time I say this is working, albeit more slowly than advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be updating this, and possibly changing the star rating.  We&#x27;ll see.  First, I do have to say that I have PCOS (Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome).  For those of you, lucky enough to NOT have this syndrome, I&#x27;ll explain.  I have massive amounts of black hair, EVERYWHERE.  I admit, I have been cheating so far, and have been using it every other day on my lower legs, abdomen, chest, and face.  Even though I know the directions say not to use it on the face, and to use it every 2 weeks.  I did buy red laser goggles, so, I am protecting my eyes.  I have really high hopes for this machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had laser treatments at a salon, I never had the money.  I&#x27;ve been dealing with unwanted hair by shaving, and have been shaving since the ripe old age of 14.  I&#x27;m now 33, so, as you can imagine, the 5&#x27;oclock shadow is prominent.  And it&#x27;s getting to the point where I have to buy special theatrical make-up from Ben Nye to cover the mustache (even immediately after shaving).  I have really fair skin, so, This is product is supposed to be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed, is that since I&#x27;m a pro with a razor by now, I have to wait until evening to use this machine (otherwise I feel nothing, and smell no burned hair).  So, I advise having stubble to use it on.  When there&#x27;s stubble, it does feel like a rubber band snapping you, but, it&#x27;s not horrible.  I have it on the highest setting for my legs, stomach, and chest.  But, I do have to turn it down to #2 for my face right now.  But, I started on 1, so, it gets more tolerable.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference as of yet, but, I have noticed that I&#x27;m starting to itch.  I&#x27;m told that means the hair is starting to detach!  Yay!! (I hope).  More to come!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/2/13: So, I decided to get out the tweezers last night.  The hair is starting to just slide right out of the follicle.  So, it appears to be working!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/10/13: This is definitely working!!  Now, if you&#x27;re one of those people who have a few hairs here and there, I have no sympathy, and you&#x27;re likely not going to like this machine.  But, I can tell you that my chest has went from dark black hairs and having to shave it off every day, to not having to shave it at all in over 5 days.  I&#x27;m talking 90% reduction in hair in that area.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my face or my legs, but, I can honestly say that I&#x27;m at about a 50% reduction on my stomach as well. I haven&#x27;t used it on my legs in about a week though.  The light died on me, but, I honestly don&#x27;t blame it haha.  I used it at least 4 times on my lower legs, my stomach, my chest, and my face.  So, I&#x27;m sure it was at least 1500 pulses before it went out. I can say that, so far, it&#x27;s cut my daily shaving ritual down considerably, and I&#x27;m sooo not done.  I&#x27;m ordering another replacement battery, just because I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  So far, I absolutely do not regret my purchase.  I moved the star rating up to a 4, because it is most definitely working.  It&#x27;ll get a 5 when it proves to me that it works everywhere, and gives me a good amount of hair reduction everywhere. Oh, and I have been able to up the strength to a 5 (the highest level) everywhere I use it.</li>
    <li> Best thing ever! It works so well! I used to be self conscious about my chin hair. After the first use it was barley there. I use it every few weeks now. It has made a huge difference. If you are thinking about it get it, it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product as I was hoping that it would be more effective in a shorter time.  I have now used it 12 times and I still have to shave as the hairs on my legs keep coming through.  They appear finer, but there are still a lot of them.  The process takes a little while to complete, it is not just a matter of a few minutes, and I am having to use it every week.  I have also got through a few bulbs, which at £25 each, is costly.  I read the information provided thoroughly before paying over £250 for the equipment, thinking that it would be an ideal solution to years of having to shave my coarse brown hairs, but I am still having to shave and use this as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times with no obvious results. Saddened. And disappointed. Hoping that maybe if I keep trying eventually do something.</li>
    <li> There is significantly less hair in the areas I am treating, and growth is much slower for the hair that is still growing, which is very minimal. This is perfect! I will use this until I can&#x27;t anymore, and I would probably buy another after that, but I may not need to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Indian with thick curly hair that has historically been awful about getting ingrown after waxing. So I&#x27;ve been shaving for a good 30 years or so and was really only looking for something that would slow down the process. The iLight is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not perfect: hair does eventually start growing back in near-noticeable thickness after about 6-8 months in my case. So, hey, I invested another $25 in another lightbulb and another 90 minutes of minor wincing, and I&#x27;m back to shaving once a week at MOST. My eyebrow waxing lady oohed and aahed over the results, and surely she would be a good judge :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The important thing to remember is that you must do the treatment 3 times in one 2-week time period. If you don&#x27;t, some hairs in the treated areas will escape being zapped during their growth cycle. I was more rigorous about doing each patch 3 separate times a few days apart on my second round of treatment (and possibly the follicles are meeker after their last experience), and I am seeing more consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip that may be useful to remember is that a lot of the people who \\&quot;qualify\\&quot; to use the iLight may have variable skin color over their body surface. Since darker skin absorbs more energy, I am cautious over tanned areas--in fact, I&#x27;m waiting to do my forearms till winter when they&#x27;ve faded a bit, because the darker the area, the more it stings.</li>
    <li> ...but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I have light skin/dark hair, and I followed the directions exactly (including waiting the full 2 weeks between treatments). I saw zero difference in my hair after whatever number of treatments the instructions recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found the machine a bit tedious to use- because of the small size of the head covering your legs can take quite a long time. I will say I used it on the top setting and only found is mildly &amp; occasionally painful, but then again I&#x27;m used to waxing. The only bright side is apparently I didn&#x27;t get a defective cartridge like a bunch of people seemed to- mine didn&#x27;t give out until near the end of my last treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very hopeful after reading the reviews here, but apparently this machine is not for me. I&#x27;m going to pass it on to a friend and see if it works better for her.</li>
    <li> I brought it 6 mouth ago, it do works, but slow. I think it may take 2 years to reach the goal. The main problem is it&#x27;s hurt. And if you use the carbon dye, the result is much better, and hurts more. If use carbon dye, Do not need to wax. Just use it and wash. The result is dramaticly different.</li>
    <li> It does work, just be patient and use as directed! Armpit hair practically gone in a month, bikini area - huge difference after just one use. To me, very good buy.</li>
    <li> This equipment is worth its cost. I like that is available and less expensive than going to sessions in a beauty place. The cartridges last quite a bit taking in cosideration that i use it to the maximum strength. I do see improvement in the hair loss</li>
    <li> So far so good ... it has removed hair and I am still working on my first 6 wee ks but looks promising</li>
    <li> I bought this mainly for my bikini area. I live by the ocean and love to surf. I am allergic to wax and shaving caused red bumps and ingrown hairs like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I bought this mainly to solve that issue and because I liked the idea of going long periods of time without having to shave or do anything. It works sort of. I have treatment areas that really took care of the hair and then some where hair seemed to not be affected at all. I have light olive skin (no tan at the moment) and extremely dark hair, which should be perfect. So far, I am still having to shave but with no red bumps or ingrown hairs. I treat every two weeks as well. Hopefully it will start working better. I may have to set it higher. I currently run it on three, which is the middle. I guess the real take away is what you initially purchased the machine for. I did buy this with the hopes of getting rid of the red bump and ingrown hair problem. But I also wanted to shave less and not have to worry about whether or not I needed to shave before getting in my suit. Overall, I do like it though.</li>
    <li> I use my twice? and the Skin sensor went off , now I can not use-it will not stop beeping</li>
    <li> I have owned this for about a month and wanted to wait to write a review until after I have used it several times.  I am the ideal candidate with dark hair and light skin, and after reading other reviews I decided that I would try using it on my face (despite the product telling you not to).  For me it really did work.  It does not remove hair all together but in a few treatments there is a noticeable difference. At first, hair seems to come in much thicker and I was nervous, but then in a few days it falls out and substantially less grows back.  Make sure you buy an extra cartridge because the indicator light only comes on when the cartridge needs replaced, not when it is getting close.  Its a good product, but hopefully in the future they will come up with something that is a little closer to what a doctors office has that would offer more permanent results.</li>
    <li> When the product works it seems to work well. The first one I had, the light went out after 3 or 4 uses. I sent it back, they sent me a new one and that machine&#x27;s light went out after one and a half uses. I like the product and want to keep using it because I have noticed slight results after the few times I&#x27;ve actually been able to use it. However, I&#x27;m not paying this kind of money for a product only to have to replace the light after each use. My friend has the same one and she has not had any issues and she has noticed results as well.</li>
    <li> I was scared first to try it but those areas were the primary reason I got this. It is not painful, does not burn and most importantly I did manage to reduce those nasty chin hairs! I paid over a 1000 few years ago for a laser treatment that didn&#x27;t bring any results. I did however used this on my face on a lowest setting. Hope this will help someone else with same problem.</li>
    <li> was not what I expected.  Can not be used on face plus my coloring is to light.  Returned item.</li>
    <li> Can not use it on face.</li>
    <li> Do the research. These home machines don&#x27;t work. Even the professional lasers aren&#x27;t permanent-you still have to go for expensive touch ups.  But we can keep hoping!</li>
    <li> I am a white guy with dark hair and an average complexion. This product never worked for me. I used it over and over on the highest setting and the hair always grew back. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It slows the growth but was rather painful. I use it for my bikini line and my under arm. I cannot take the pain of using it all over my body. Maybe I have a low tolerance for pain. It slows the growth but not all areas. I&#x27;m still looking for the right product. Not convinced this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> You have to be consistent about using it. It does make hair grow back thinner and slower. It doesn&#x27;t hurt. I wouldn&#x27;t use it for large amounts of hair, like your legs. Be careful using it on your face. If you have fillings in your teeth it will hurt!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my (now) wife. Initially, it worked well. She was pleased with the results. However, I can&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s not exactly cheap to buy. You&#x27;d think with a higher entry price that most of your cost is up front. Not so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s EXPENSIVE to maintain and use. You can figure on paying roughly $25 for ONE treatment of your two legs. Good luck hitting the underarms or bikini area before the light &amp;#34;burns out.&amp;#34; So by the time she used this on all the places she wanted, we&#x27;re in it for almost $50/month to use this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Quality control. Apparently this is put together by monkeys. I am very careful in caring for anything electronic (I still have and use 20+ year old electronic equipment). After each use, it was stored back in it&#x27;s original box exactly as it was shipped. But one month after the warranty expires, the wand malfunctions. New light does nothing to fix it. No diagnostics of any sort, can&#x27;t unplug the wand and buy a new one. Now I have a $230 useless paperweight that has cost me closer to $400 (lights, you know!) with no lasting results to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the headache of dealing with this, suck it up, and pay a professional. Or, you know, just take $300-400 and flush it down the toilet. I&#x27;d flush the i-Light, if it would fit.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know yet.. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month (I did 5 treatments so far) and the hair seem to be diminished but I am not sure about the results.. I am waiting for see more satisfactory results and I will be updating this..</li>
    <li> I am 67 years old and always suffered with facial hair.  In my 30&#x27;s I had electrolysis treatment all over my face, which was very successful.  But as I grew older, thick black hair started regrowing, especially on my chin area.  I had to shave twice a day.  Last summer (2013) I decided to try the pro light from Remington, and what a transformation has occurred!  after about 2 months my chin hair was almost gone, within 5 months, I had almost no hair left. I now no longer have to shave, nor be embarrassed by black chin stuble.  It has been 8 months now, I still have the original cartridge, and my facial  hair has virtually disappeared.  I love this product and the results I have observe&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    <li> it works exactly as expected without complicated instructions or numerous parts to piece together. this works better than anything else out there.</li>
    <li> This is a complete waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;Hair doesn&#x27;t react to even the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;The worst product I ever purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I completed professional laser hair removal on 4 areas and that worked great, hair free 3 years after the initial treatment.&lt;br /&gt;You have to shave before professional treatment as hair burns and curls.&lt;br /&gt;For the last 2 treatments I did not shave as there were only a few hairs left and they curled and later fell off.&lt;br /&gt;Since I did laser hair removal without numbing creams it hurts a bit, especially in sensitive areas like underarms.&lt;br /&gt;As lower legs responded great, I tried iLight on thighs and arms, but got no effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;Thus I know that it is not my skin and hair combination that doesn&#x27;t react, but that iLight is just not effective at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With iLight nothing happens, no hair curling (even when hair is not shaved), no pain, no sensation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I trusted the negative reviews and did not order in the first place as the return policy is short.</li>
    <li> My wife can&#x27;t use the device anymore, because there not a back up light inside the box. So, now she need to be waiting until purchase another light with no real experience about the light time of live. She&#x27;s disappointed.</li>
    <li> Actually works!  After a few uses noticed hair growing back much slower.</li>
    <li> Takes quite a bit of time, but it seems to be making a difference. Over all I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I used this as directed for about 3 months and although I saw the hair thin out and take longer to grow back, it certainly isn&#x27;t permanent. It smarts just a bit, but if you are familiar with waxing, the snap you feel with this is nothing compared to that. It takes a few months to see any results so you have to stick with it. The downside to this is that you are still shaving and also doing this on top of freshly shaved legs, so it can get monotonous.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. be aware that the bulbs do go out fast at 30.00 ea. But treated areas does have results! It helps if you wax an area then treat that area with the Remington! better results because the hair follicle bulb is hit directly with the light, No hair growing back at all!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. She told me that it worked very well and I was the hero, and that&#x27;s always fun!.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and already I am not shaving as often. I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> After using this product, exactly as the directions have stated, I am now done with my 3 treatments.  This is the amount of time it says that you should use and expect results.  Although I do have less hair, it&#x27;s not gone by any means!  Still need to shave daily, but it is not as coarse.  I will continue to use for a few more sessions and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it thought I could use it on my face but u can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Only 10 flashes and then the device does not flash any more! We used it for the first time and only after 10 flashes, it died. I wonder how can it flash 1500 times?! I called the costumer service but they are not going to change the unit at this time instead are going to send me a replacement cartridge! Why should it defect this soon? The bulb indicator is green but it does not work. I am so sorry for this low quality product.</li>
    <li> I sent the unit to Brazil, and it already ruined.I&#x27;m very upset. What should I do? Can I return? Livia</li>
    <li> I stalked this product on sale for about 1 year before I finally decided to buy it. I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to work, and it&#x27;s not exactly cheap. I guess I was deterred by negative reviews. However, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with me. I&#x27;m half asian, so I have the really dark hair. I tan easily, but mostly my skin is light. As soon as I got this, I read the manual and watched the instruction videos. I started with my armpit. Yes, the application is a bit uncomfortable (think sewing and pricking yourself with a needle without breaking skin uncomfortable), but not really bad. At first it didn&#x27;t look like anything happened. However, by the end of the 2 week waiting period, I could see I had less dense hair. It&#x27;s been 4 applications, and I&#x27;m almost to no hairs growing under my arms, which is pretty awesome. I think it is taking that long because I have thicker hair, but overall this product is doing an amazing job. It is not quicker than shaving, but considering the fact that the hair doesn&#x27;t grow in the next day, it is totally worth it. Much less painful than waxing, much less smelly than hair removal products, and overall just lasts longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were not sure about this product before, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> my 15 year old daughter thought it hurt a lot.  I tried it and didn&#x27;t think it was too painful, but only does a centimeter at a  time and takes forever.  Can&#x27;t use it on facial hair which the &amp;#34;NoNo&amp;#34;  can be used for.  Should have bought the NoNo.</li>
    <li> This machine works great for me. It has really reduced the hair growth and saves me a lot of time.</li>
    <li> I used this product religously for 6 months and it made absolutely no difference in hair growth. I would be the ideal candidate for this, very fair skin &amp; very dark corse hair. I even used it more than recomended hoping for some change but nope nothing. I have a very hard time believing the positive reviews here. Unless my system was a dud but I really dont think thats the case. I bough many replacement cartriges, they couldnt have all been bad. And of course, after I finally gave up on this after sooo many hours wasted ( not to mention hundreds of dollars ) it was way too late to return it. If you are absolutely dead set on trying something like this, I would recomend buying it from somewhere like Sephora or Ulta that has a good return policy. And keep ur receipt bc I doubt it&#x27;ll work. In my area and prob most major cities there are always Groupons for laser hair removal, you are better off spending your money there.</li>
    <li> I used as directed.  I waited several months to review in order to allow the time it says it takes to see results.  I barely noticed a difference.  I&#x27;m back to shaving because it&#x27;s faster and you have to shave when using this anyway. It&#x27;s very time consuming if using on large areas, like legs.  I have dark hair but a fair to medium skin color so I am a perfect candidate for the system.  Disappointed and felt like it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> i am of chinese descent..very fair skinned&lt;br /&gt;but after&lt;br /&gt;-two cartridge down...&lt;br /&gt;-been doing it almost every wk most of the time and sometimes every 3 days..&lt;br /&gt;still the hair in the armpit and pubic area still grows back..though not as fast.. after the 2nd day of treatment the hair starts to grow back...and though its not as thick..&lt;br /&gt;but why is it that the hairs still keep on growing back..i thought this machine is meant to kill the hair follicles..what am i doing wrong????????????</li>
    <li> Does not work and is very time consuming.</li>
    <li> Waiting for results, but so far so good.  This device needs at least two weeks to see if the hair actually comes in or not.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I used this last year and then again this spring to get ready for summer.  If I stuck to the 2 week intervals, I&#x27;d probably had been hairless a long time ago, but I&#x27;m not good at keeping up the routine.  I have used it for two sessions in the last month or so.  I am virtually hairless.  There are a couple of more stubborn patches on my legs and armpits that I probably need to hit one or two more times, and then presto!  I&#x27;m good.  Not sure if the hair will grow back like it did last year.  I think I might be able to get by with a touch up here and there from now on.  We shall see.  Either way, I don&#x27;t have to worry about shaving for the time being.  Even if some hair grows, it&#x27;s barely anything and it seems to be a lot finer.  And I had some pretty dark thick hair before.</li>
    <li> this item was good but the result is only for a week and it grows back again, i ended up going to derma clinic to do the laser hair removal, the real thing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, it beeps at you when you got it right, it buzzes at you if you got the positioning wrong.  The actual light pulse IS hot and WILL singe hair if you don&#x27;t shave beforehand....  My hair is actually very white blonde, but the parts where I want it gone, it is darker so I&#x27;m hoping there is enough pigment in those areas so the IPL will work on it.  DON&#x27;T look at the friggin light when it pulses.  I wanted to see how it worked so I did that and no, it&#x27;s not pleasant.  Laugh at my expense, it&#x27;s ok because I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will re-review in 1 months time to tell you how things are &amp;#34;growing&amp;#34; along as it says in the instructions, &amp;#34;Do your first 3 treatments in the first month.  Then use to &#x27;touch-up&#x27; after that.  Have fun ladies and gents.  Good product so far.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a guy.  i like certain areas to be smooth.  hey it&#x27;s 2012!  that&#x27;s okay these days!  ;-)  anyway this is actually targeted to guys AND gals though of course it&#x27;s mostly women that are into hair removal.  but there&#x27;s even a guy on the package / box for this, and if you check the remington online site and watch their promo video, they also show a guy using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway after having this for about 5 months now, i have definitely noticed a difference in frequency and volume of hair, in areas that i want to keep smooth.  there is *not* 100% reduction in hair -- but there is definitely less.  i wouldn&#x27;t say this has left me hairless, it has just left me with less hair, in areas i target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i started off using power level 1 like the instructions suggest.  and waiting \\&quot;2 weeks\\&quot; for the hair to fall out per instructions, but i didn&#x27;t really notice anything.  i started turning up the volume, and now i use it on power level 5, the highest.  and although it says use it every 2 weeks, i do it every week.  this still has *not* zapped the hair completely (white skin, black hair... should be a perfect candidate for this to work), BUT... there is definitely less hair.  and whatever else remains i just shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is definitely definitely more smooth.  but where ever i zap is not 100% hair free.  but oh well your body is trying to naturally grow hair and you&#x27;re trying to kill it!  i guess nature wins!  still... for removing 70-80% of the hair, i think this actually does a good job.  i&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it did ALL the hair, especially because of skin and hair type, where it says i&#x27;m the perfect candidate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a note... i&#x27;ve tried shaving before... and epilating before.  both these methods would ALWAYS lead to unsightly, bumpy and uncomfy ingrown hairs, even if if tried every trick in the book to avoid them (tend skin, aloe vera, baby powder, shea butter).  using the ipl (and still shaving any strays) is the only method that has not resulted in pimply and unsightly ingrown hairs.  i still use tendskin afterwards and then moisturize as much as possible.  (i don&#x27;t know if its the tendskin, or the moisturizer that now keeps things smooth!).  but i am not vexed by ingrown hairs anymore, and the general result is again... pretty slick and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for now, this remington system (which is quite a nicely built machine), with a bit of shaving, and a bit of tendskin then moisturizer (olay 7 effects... who said it&#x27;s meant only for your face!)... is definitly keeping things nice and smooth...  i&#x27;ve tried lots.  for now, this is definitely what&#x27;s working for me best!  it is also CONVENIENT.  can do it at home when i need and want, and not have to make a salon appointment.  some people have said depending on the # of cartridges you use and their life, it&#x27;s actually as expensive as a salon.  but if you think about how you have to schedule life, errands, and time around a salon appointment, i think even if this worked out to the same cost-wise, i&#x27;d much rather save the time and avoid the hassle of going to a salon and simply do this at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, not perfect, but pretty pretty good.</li>
    <li> I bought this months ago, followed the instructions and it is working.&lt;br /&gt;I went to a professional a couple times and spent triple the amount -decided to just give this a try and I am glad I did.</li>
    <li> Very expensive and did not work at all.</li>
    <li> I have owned this for almost 2 months.  Used as indicated, as often as indicated and at the highest setting with NO RESULTS.  You will not be able to return it after 30 days.  Which it is perfect timing for the seller, since it takes over 30 days to see any results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy who&#x27;s had professional laser hair removal in the salon to take care of body hair on my chest and arms. So going into at-home IPL hair removal, I at least had an inkling of what to expect. Anyone who&#x27;s had &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; laser hair removal before will see right away that this unit is a worthless piece of garbage. I felt absolutely no difference in &amp;#34;intensity&amp;#34; between the lowest setting and the highest setting, and no pain at all. Now, I&#x27;m no masochist, but in order for a product like this to work, you should be feeling the light zapping your hair follicles. I even tested it on my leg hair, which is very dense, and still no pain. This alone would prove that this product has absolutely nowhere near enough power to actually zap hair follicles. No pain, no redness, no nothing. (I mention the redness because my skin, in addition to being fair, is also very sensitive and would usually redden for a few moments after zapping in the salon -- not so with the Remington.) Also, after repeated use on the same areas-- I&#x27;m the ideal candidate by the way (super pale skin, very dark hair), not a SINGLE hair has fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advice anyone reading these reviews and considering purchasing this product to look very carefully at the glowing 5-star reviews, and check to see if those customers even have other reviewers, or if they mysteriously only decided to rate this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I made. Just wax, or epilate, or if you have money to blow, go to a salon and get it done professionally. Sure it&#x27;s overpriced there and the technicians are usually careless, but at least the areas they zap will actually &amp;#34;get&amp;#34; the hair follicles, unlike the Remington I-Light Pro.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and set up. I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I even use it on my face .</li>
    <li> product did not work as promised .  no changes then when you are almost done with treatment lamp goes .... not worth the money at all</li>
    <li> may perhaps i have the strongest hair in the universe and this machine can not tame my wild hair perhaps..it is a mild fix</li>
    <li> When I started to use it, I thought my legs would be free of all hair after three or four treatments. That did not happen. After five sessions, I still have around 25 / 30 % of hair in my legs. That is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;However, it did worked wonderfully in my bikini area. I am very satisfied with this product, because my biggest issue with hair removal was always the bikini area; I have white and sensitive skin, with dark and thick hair in this area, and always had bumps and alergic reaction after shaving or waxing it. Now, after only two treatments in this area, ( using maximum intensity level ), I am almost free of the unwanted hair, and did not have any king of alergic reaction .&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it in in my legs too. Now, I think this is the best solution for hair removal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m writing this review on behalf of my wife who is disinclined to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The provider of this product provides you w/ just over a month to receive, utilize &amp; evaluate this product before you&#x27;re &amp;#34;unable to return it.&amp;#34; . . . now this is ridiculous, because the instructions even state that &#x27;results are not instantaneous &amp; results may vary w/ time &amp; usage&#x27; . . . so, as such, you&#x27;d expect that it may take several treatments extended over the 37 days they permit you (before you&#x27;re unable to return it) . . . additionally, according to the product literature the initial cartridge (that ships w/ the product) should:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;. . . provide 1,500 flashes for 2-3 full body treatments&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say, that this cartridge (much like the initial printer ink cartridge you get w/ a new printer) did NOT live up to &#x27;as advertised.&#x27; So, you&#x27;d better not require a second cartridge during that 37-day trial period -or- order you&#x27;d better order it at the same time as the main unit; because you only have 37 days to notice results before you&#x27;re &#x27;out of luck.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were possible to give this product a negative star (as snake oil); then I&#x27;d (or my wife) would likely do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I (she) would not recommend this product for use on a Hairless Chinese Crested Dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s., my 2-cents: It&#x27;s ridiculous to permit a 30 day return policy (or just over) for a costly product that clearly tells you that results will vary among people &amp; take longer depending upon individual circumstances (thus leading the consumer to believe &amp;#34;oh, perhaps I just need a couple more treatments&amp;#34; . . . . this is no doubt their intended design in marketing this product; but poor form in my opinion; if not out-right manipulative)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shek</li>
    <li> This item does not work, very disappointed! A waste of money, wish I could get my money back. A bad purchase decision</li>
    <li> Very loud, like a hairdryer on low, also kinda painful, but you get used to it. Some results after 3 uses, I&#x27;d recommend more treatments, but it does work good.</li>
    <li> It takes some time, patience and commitment, but it works!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift.  He was not interested in continuing to purchase the cartridge refills, so he just did his legs twice &amp; quit.  I waited for several months before deciding that is just too much money spent to sit there... so I began the treatments myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES take quite a while to cover your entire body, so allow yourself at LEAST an hour each time you sit down to remove your hair.  I have worked it into my weekly workout routine &amp; actually do it in the locker room (they have a spare room for nursing mothers with an outlet in there!) I treat myself every other weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give this product a **5 Stars** but I just CAN&#x27;T because it absolutely does NOT do what it says in the TIME FRAME that they claim.  I chose **4 Stars** because I do in fact have less hair.... 3 months later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have religiously adhered to my hair removal schedule... even tracked my treatments on a calendar for 3 months now &amp; indicated what body part was treated.  I can honestly tell you that it WILL *REDUCE* YOUR HAIR.  I will continue to keep after it &amp; post -in the future- if ALL my hair does in fact go away.  I can honestly say that I do have less hair, but I would NOT say 50%.  Probably closer to 25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I do not have better news - - I really wanted to hold off on posting this, but I figured that 3 months of tracking was a long time!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff around.  worth the extra money. Lasts a very long time.  I recommend this particular product</li>
    <li> this product does not work an I am so upset that I even spent that much money on it an I would like to returne it if I could it does not work at all</li>
    <li> dont buy this it only temporarily removes hair then it grows back within a month or so. Whats the point of buying this? After about 4 hard core sessions the bulb died so now it needs a new one. No thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done two rounds and got a new thermal tip. I see thinner hair on my legs, bikini area, and underarms, it is not as effective on my face. I&#x27;m hoping a couple more rounds will do it.  My face and body hair are blonde, and my skin is somewhat olive and tanned, so I&#x27;m not an ideal candidate.</li>
    <li> For those who have suffered the embarrassing problem of unwanted hair. I received my Remington after researching several different hair removal products in april its now june and about half the unwanted hair is gone. Ive had no problems with the machine or using it. I will happily continue to use this product till all the hair is gone. Thank you for helping with a problem that for me was no less crippling than having a deformity. Life changing. BN</li>
    <li> First of all, i bought this almost 2 years ago, and now i can say how it worked. Im a brunet skin, and i had very Very hairy legs. I had a lot of questions about this product but reading some reviews i finally got it. My first time using it was amazing, since i knew that it wasn&#x27;t going to work instantly, i waited pacient for 2 weeks to have my second time. After the sencond time using it i saw results.. so i got even more excited.. so i did it very responsably for 3 months, using it every 2 weeks. The initial cartridge lasted for about 2 months.. then i realiced that the cartridges leasts for 3 and a half sessions (half leg, bikini and underarms) very good... then I stopped using it, and results leasted for about 6 months.. i mean, is not 100% perfect, but before I got it, I was shaving my legs daily (sometimes 2 times per day to keep it smooth).. with the IPL treatment, im shaving once every 10 days, and just because i have some rebel hairs that refuses to go, but the thikness of the little hairs remaining are about 20% of the real hair. I stopped using it for 6 to 8 months, and hairs never came the same as the used to be, it was like 70% of what the used to, so i ordered more cartidges, and started again... for my suprise, it took me just 3 sessions (month and a half) to be with no hairs. there are some spaces that never came back :) then I stopped again for 6 months, and i just did it again 2 months ago and im still supriced... this time i can say it took off about 95% of my hairs. so, if you keep it constant, trust me, this is the best depilation device i ever had. I tried before with EVERYTHING I found for hair removal.. dont waste your money and your time with wax or the worse depilator machines, this is the best inverse ever... and i still have 3 cartridges left from the ones i bought about a year ago, for me, they just worked as described, and better. Thumbs up for Remington.</li>
    <li> Sent it back without using it. It was a gift.</li>
    <li> Bought the product 5 weeks ago. Use it once a week. Only use it on bikini area because the window head is so small that I could not imagine so much effort and replacement heads it would take to do my legs! So far, patchy results. It takes about 15 minutes to cover this area. Will update when area actually is completely done without strange patches bare spots and regrowth. After 7 weeks about the same.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product. It was not suitable for my skin and although the return period was elapsed they were really caring and gave me a refund. I think in this kind of product having a good provider is as important as the product itself and P.S IMPORT is a good service provider. Totally recommended for good service and safety of your investment.</li>
    <li> I spent 1 year doing treatments on one specific area, and the hair is still there.  Hasn&#x27;t changed a bit.  The light eventually burned out, and since it doesn&#x27;t work anyway, I never replaced it.  &amp;#34;Works&amp;#34; only on dark hair--mines as dark as it gets folks.. I&#x27;m here to tell you, this does not last.  Oh believe me it will burn you like it&#x27;s working, and burn the hair, but it grows right back.  Use a lighter instead if you want to fry your hair off, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use, and it actually works as described. After several uses, I noticed a big reduction in hair growth. I saw some reviews on here saying it&#x27;s okay to use on the face, but it&#x27;s not advisable. It&#x27;s not recommended for use on the face because the light can cause eye damage. I tried it on the lower chin area at the lowest setting, and that seemed to be fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t go any higher on the face than that. Whatever you do, DO NOT use it anywhere near your eyes! It works real well on basically any body area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been anxiously awaiting this order so I could begin using it right away on my unwanted facial hair (chin and upper lip) and finally made the plunge to purchase this.  The description on Amazon includes &amp;#34;Each 1,500-flash cartridge can deliver two to three full body treatments (underarms, lower legs, bikini area).&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;unwanted body hair&amp;#34;.  The box says, &amp;#34;Contraindications: DO NOT USE ON THE FACE...&amp;#34;   While this is accurate, it took the actual words in the instruction manual on p. 12, &amp;#34;DO NOT use on the face&amp;#34; for me to realize this was STRICTLY for body which means &amp;#34;below the neck&amp;#34;!!  UGH!!!  If the Amazon description had had these words, I would not have purchased it.  Now, I am considering trying it anyway on my face, but I probably won&#x27;t because I have sensitive skin and would be afraid of blisters or skin darkening.  So, the rating is not actually reflective of the product at all, but of the lack of the specific words for NOT using on the FACE.  It&#x27;s my fault, for assuming &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; included face.  Oh well. I wanted to let others know about this in case you were considering purchase.  The full text says &amp;#34;DO NOT USE ON face, head, ears, or neck, DO NOT USE on or around the eyes, eyebrows, or eyelashes, DO NOT USE on tattoos, dark brown/black spots such as freckles, birthmarks, moles, or warts, DO NOT USE on nipples genitalia, or around the anus.&amp;#34;  So, back to the drawing board to look for a product I CAN use on my face.  UPDATE one week later: I decided to keep it after I came back and read other people&#x27;s reviews who used it on their faces. I wonder the same as one of the reviewers that said someone would probably use it improperly on their face and blind themselves which is why they couldn&#x27;t approve it for the face. So, I started treatment on my chin to see how it goes before moving to my upper lip.  I have sensitive skin and past sun burns and waxing in which some skin was ripped off have left dark splotches on my skin on the upper lip. So, I want to try the chin hairs first to see how my skin responds.  Will post updates after the first three treatments which are supposed to be two weeks apart.....  UPDATE many months later: Well, I used it exactly according to directions. I do see a lessening of facial hair, but I am still tweezing and shaving, so it doesn&#x27;t eliminate--just like everything else I&#x27;ve tried (professional laser treatments included).  Facial hair is relentless!  I do want to tell people that I tightly close my eyes AND cover tightly with my free hand when I treat my upper lip and chin. I can still see the red flash even through all that.  I don&#x27;t know anything about this type of light to tell you if that&#x27;s really bad, but do exercise some caution.  It hasn&#x27;t left any other marks on my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects from it such as reddening of the skin, no burning, nothing.  So, I&#x27;m very happy about that.  It&#x27;s very quick.  I found that I can set it higher (3 or 4) to do my big toes and I don&#x27;t feel a &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34;.  I keep the setting at a 2 for my face.  Best wishes.  I changed my rating from a 2 star to a 3 star.  If I didn&#x27;t have to tweeze still, I&#x27;d have given it a 5 star.  I highly doubt there is anything that completely eliminates facial hair.  If there is, tell me please.</li>
    <li> i notice a very very significant reduction of hair growth on different areas of my body. I highly recommend this!!!&lt;br /&gt;totally worth your money!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. Everything was on time. I love to use it. Cause It will make me clean without hair.</li>
    <li> it stopped working but i dont know why, it says it has 1500 flashes, i only used obut 50 and it stopped working, the indicator light is on so its ready for discharge i push it against my skin i head the beep and push the buttom as i did it before but nothing happenes, iturned it off and on a couple of times but nothing better, in the first session i used it on my under arms, about a week after on my bikini line, another week after on my underarn again, but after the second discharge it stopped working, and there is no way to get in touch with the seller to ask questions or to let them know i have this problem with my new remington i light, i dont know where can i get help, i liked the product so far, but now i dont know what to do with it  :(  HELP</li>
    <li> i ordered this item , didnt work at all and now i have for pay for returing it from middle east to usa and pay again for replacing it with a new one??????!!!! really bad</li>
    <li> I could write a book on this.  All I can say it works.  I am impressed</li>
    <li> It could not be used on the face and my thin, fine blonde hair would also have been a challenge.</li>
    <li> i have finished my 3º session in legs, bikini area and underarm, so far no differences. I used the lowest setting on the first 2º sessions and 3 intense level in my 3º session, but no results. the hair keeps growing and in the same color (no brighter or lighter color hair) and it really hurts in my underarms even in the lowest setting, and where i have little moles. am i doing something wrong? every session was after 2 weeks from each other. now that i finished my 3º session how often can i use it because i still see no results?</li>
    <li> The item is defective. It doesn&#x27;t work. I sent an email to the manufacturer and still hoping they would respond. I don&#x27;t live in not party America so the toll free number doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> works as described but not as effective as hoped hair came out easy for a bit but then new hair came in within a week and grew atleast 1/4-1/2&amp;#34; in length and shipped fast thanks</li>
    <li> Ordered this several weeks ago and wanted to really use it before I submitted a review.  First let me state that I am the optimal user for this devise I have dark hair and fair skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks on my underarms and it&#x27;s working slowly.  I spaced out the first 3 uses 2 weeks apart like the instructions say and by the 3rd use I saw one small patch of missing hair.  After that I&#x27;ve used it weekly for the past 2 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing much better results.  On my 5th treatment and I only have a few hairs growing.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t consider treatment painful, ocassionally there is a burning sensation but it only last a few seconds.  Overall I&#x27;d say it was worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Initial light cartridge lasted five minutes!</li>
    <li> What a relief, after years of shaving, plucking and hair removal creams.  I can say this is a great investment decision.  Been using for 5 weeks as stated but with 2nd and 4th week,  I treated the area the next week,  instead of skipping a week.  Results are noticeable no more bumps and minimal hair growth and shaving before treatment is smooth,  probably from the hair dying from the last session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Male Review,  San Diego CA</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Quick delivery .  I really like being able to use at my convenience instead of having to schedule appointments.  So far I&#x27;m havering great results.</li>
    <li> The unit seems to be very well built, however, the process of hair removal is far more involved than the Remington company claims.  It will take a person close to one year to get rid of heavily haired areas, many replacement cartridges and persistence.  It can be done, but not in a low number of sessions as the company will advertise.  There is some tingle every time the light flashes, but nothing very painful....soon you will use the maximum setting as the area accustoms itself to the treatment.  Some rash may be experienced on the first couple sessions only. Once accomplished, the revealed skin of the particular area is left very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> Since about sixth grade I&#x27;ve had dark hair on my belly and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING to get rid of it: shaving, waxing, sugaring, plucking, using depilatory creams, and nothing ever helped. I ended up getting a lot of scars from ingrown hairs and I felt awful about how my stomach looked. I ordered this about 3 months ago as a last resort and I&#x27;m so happy. For the first few times, I used it every 2 weeks like it says but I now use it every week. I went from having pretty dark, thick belly hairs to having very few lighter, thinner hairs in 3 months! I&#x27;ve also started using it on my chin (even though it says not to use on the face) but I haven&#x27;t been using it there as much so I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of progress. I can use the level five setting on my tummy and thighs without pain, but it does hurt more on places where there is less fat, like armpits.</li>
    <li> As I progressed in to menopause I started growing a full out manstache! Thick black hair like a man!! Even though I shaved it off I had a literal 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by the end of the day. It was horrifying!! I decided to give this a try before signing up for professional treatments.  I DID NOT follow the manufacturers directions and instead used the device every other day. I DID NOT shave beforehand so that the laser could find the dark hair and get after it. The pain for me was minimal and I worked my way up to the highest setting after about a week. A little pain is a small price to pay for being hair free.  After 2 months I am 70% hair free on my upper lip and will continue to use the light pro for maintenance.  It is so nice to just do this at home whenever necessary. My advice is to give it a try. The cost is less than one professional treatment and hopefully it will work for you too.</li>
    <li> 6 months in and not sure if is see a difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about once every 3 weeks for 8 months now. I use the highest setting. It can sometimes feel like being slapped by a ruler, but I wanted to have the greatest effect I could get. My arm hairs are about 50% less and the ones that grow back are visibly thinner and lighter. This is the same for my chin region, armpits, and lower abdomen.&lt;br /&gt;  I had professional electrolysis about 10 years ago (I am 33), weekly sessions for 4 months and did not get the results I see with this product. I have also had professional laser...which in my area of the country is about $250 per session. This product is just as good, reasonably priced, and I can do it myself at home. I get about 4 session out of a light-cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;  Caution: I didn&#x27;t really see any improvement until after I&#x27;d gone through their recommended initial treatment schedule and another session or two (about 4 months).</li>
    <li> Tip:  If you&#x27;re having problems getting the unit to unlock, don&#x27;t press your skin against the sensor.  It should just touch it or \\&quot;hover\\&quot; above it.  I had problems unlocking my unit, which leads me to my biggest complaint so far....Remington&#x27;s customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t even had a chance to do a treatment to be able to speak to the unit effectiveness at hair removal.  I have spent 2 weeks getting in touch with Remington.  First, they only open 8AM-4PM central time, M-F and closed on holidays.  I usually arrive home from work around 4:30 eastern time, by that time Remington&#x27;s \\&quot;wait\\&quot; time is 45 minutes!  I don&#x27;t know why, because when you call any other time they answer the phone right away.  Then of course they want the unit with you while you&#x27;re on the phone.  They actually told me to take it into work with me.  I was going to give up and just send it back for my refund because they just had no solution for the common working person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A snow day kept me home so I was to call, with my unit, during their unreasonable hours.  They didn&#x27;t tell me not to press my skin against the unit, they just told me my skin wasn&#x27;t compatible and to send it back!  No where in the instructions, their website, or the video that comes with it does it state you could be \\&quot;too white\\&quot;.  That was the reasoning they gave me.  I&#x27;m not pasty white, but I&#x27;m definitely not tanned.  If I knew there was a possibility that fair skin could cause an issue, I never would have purchased the unit in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some more trial and error and the thought of having to pay to ship the unit back, I finally realized if you just lay your skin over the sensor, not press it - it will actually work.  Needless to say I&#x27;m keeping the unit.  Remington&#x27;s customer service is a joke, don&#x27;t waste your time trying to troubleshoot with them.  My other frustration was the timeline I am on.  I received this as a Christmas present, so it was purchased BEFORE Christmas, and I didn&#x27;t receive it until 30 days into the trial period.  Remington was not willing to take that into consideration....the 90 day guarantee is 90 days from purchase, period.</li>
    <li> fast shipping!  good product. it is all that I expected it to be! works well and light has lasted long so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of evaluating this product. I purchased this as a NEW PRODUCT but the original light only lasted a short time. I have already replaced the I-light. I purchased 2 replacements and have had problems with the plug connections. I have to use a pencil eraser on the prongs to clean them from naturally occurring insulators. I still have to shave but the hair is thinner, lighter, and I&#x27;m not as concerned about reoccurring skin infections around old scars.</li>
    <li> Okay,&lt;br /&gt;I was debating between a 4 and 5 star but I&#x27;m giving it a 5 because I really think this beats out other hair removal options on the market today.  I do think there could be improvements but that would probably cause the cost to go way up so from a product design standpoint I think they made the best decisions they could for the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this well over a year ago- used on everything for several months with good results.  I am fair skinned and have dark thick hair.  On areas with thicker hair - like bikini area it was splotchy but still effective over time and with patience.  The biggest advantage and why I love this is that unlike almost all other options (shaving, waxing, epilating ...Yeow), this is the only option I have found that not only doesn&#x27;t cause ingrown hairs but actually helps them heal if you already have them.  I stopped using it because I felt it took too much time and started using a very high quality epilator with initial good results but I was plagued with in-grown hairs since. Talk about unsightly- it looked like I had bug bites all the time.  I have since gone back to the Remington I-light and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  The ingrown hairs are gone with no sign of new ones.  My legs and underarms are so much softer and even though I still shave, I don&#x27;t have razor burn or unsightly bumps everywhere.  I honestly believe it improves your skin quality...not sure how that&#x27;s possible with just a flash of a bright light but it&#x27;s true for me.  I have not had any issues with the cartridges being bad and I&#x27;ve gone through about 5 or 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biggest opportunity for improvement?&lt;br /&gt;- Have different sized cartridges and make the area that receives the light larger on one option so it doesn&#x27;t take so darn long to do large body parts.  I would love to tackle hubbies back but I feel like I&#x27;d need to take a vacation day to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Allow the flash to occur even if it&#x27;s not completely flat.  I get a lot of disappointing beepswhen I&#x27;m trying to do my ankles and knees, which then takes longer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Create an entire body suit with IPL so I could just jump in, flash my whole body from the neck down and jump out.  I know it would hurt like heck for about 30 seconds but it would so totally be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Remington for your awesome product!!!</li>
    <li> It is expensive, but it works. I have used it 3 or 4 times over 8 weeks on my problem areas and the hair has not come back for several days now. The downside of the product is that it is easy to miss spots, so you have to go slow and really pay attention to where you have been. I have used it on my face, chin and chest, even though it isn&#x27;t recommended for these areas and it has worked fine. It is a little painful, but it is over soon, it is best to set it on the highest you can stand. It did make my skin red for a little while, maybe an hour, but that went away with a cool washcloth and some aloe lotion.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Used as directed since April 2014 and absolutely no change in hair growth, pattern or texture.</li>
    <li> THIS IS IN TEST TIME FOR ME YET ,&lt;br /&gt;MY FIRST USE IS OK , NO PRBLEM&lt;br /&gt;WAIT FOR A SECOND TIME...</li>
    <li> It works, you just have to be a little patient. You should shave first to have a more successful outcome.</li>
    <li> Today, I am completing my third treatment (1 every two weeks as directed) and I am now ready to write my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PURCHASE: I was very hesitant to spend this amount of money, without any guaranteed. But, considering the price of laser treatments at salons, I just gave it a shot. I do not regret my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TREATMENT: The treatment takes some time, considering you have to shave and then treat the areas you wish to be &amp;#34;Hair-free&amp;#34;. However, considering you would normally shave anyway....The process is as long as it should be. The bright light is expected, but does not hurt the eyes. As long as you are not looking at it too closely--just look away once you click the flash button. I would rate the pain a 3 out of 10. It is a light sensation of burning, or a rubber-band snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS: After my second treatment, I have noticed some changes. I used to shave every other day, and the treatment reduced that frequency. BUT I could still feel the hairs, they were not completely gone. Considering my hair is thick, and dark, I did not expect it to be all gone so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase and I feel optimistic about the next few weeks. I will update if needed</li>
    <li> I have had laser treatments 6 years ago an it worked great but didn&#x27;t Last long. So annoying and cost me $800 and i couldn&#x27;t get everything i wanted done. I bought this and used it only 3 times. I see a big difference and i don&#x27;t care about how long the results lasts because I&#x27;ll just keep using it. Even if i have to buy a new system, I&#x27;ll still save money because now i can laser wherever i want at no extra cost. Just a new cartridge.  I have white skin and dark brown/black hair so I&#x27;m the perfect candidate.</li>
    <li> I ordered this unit for my wife after reading many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is now using it for more than 2 months and she says that unit does the job comparing to when going to hair saloon.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results from this device so far. And I did not receive a refill for it either and I was under the influence I did get one</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man and I ordered this to eliminate neck hairs that give me chronic in-grown hair problems. I followed all directions, I&#x27;m VERY white, and used it four times.  I&#x27;ve had zero detectable results. Now it just sits under my sink collecting dust. Maybe I&#x27;ll give it to my next girlfriend or something.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I have had laser hair removal done professionally so I am familiar with the process.  Imagine my delight, then, when I first used this product and it felt and smelled (gross, but true) the same as having IPL done at the salon.  I had never had laser hair removal done on my legs prior to buying the I-Light pro so, in the interest of science, I did one leg and left the other as-is, shaving both legs at the same time but only IPL&#x27;ing the left leg.  Two weeks after the first treatment I was blown away by the difference.  I&#x27;m now done 2 treatments and am so impressed!  I will leave the right leg for the next 3 months or so to monitor the true effect but, in the meantime, I&#x27;ve moved on to pretty much every other area, since it&#x27;s working so well.  The armpits hurt like a son of a gun but, having had salon treatments, I knew this would be the case.  So, so happy with this purchase.  And I love that the light can be replace, verses a product like the Tria which is useless after the bulb runs out.  Highly recommend!  Will try and remember to come back and give a 3, 6 and 9 month update on leg comparisons.</li>
    <li> First off, this hurts like hell on any sensitive area (like the private area lol)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my arms, the first time on level 2, then 3 more times on level 5.  Hair is still growing back like usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have spent more money on this machine than shaving in my entire 29 years of life.  Stick with real laser hair removal..</li>
    <li> Thusfar I have had pretty good success with this product. At first I was quite disappointed but after a month of using it every other day the hair is actually starting to just randomly fall out.  My skin is quite pale and my hair is a dark brown so I&#x27;m fairly ideal for IPL. I&#x27;m also male, and have really thick coarse hair on my chest and shoulders which is where I mainly used this. Basically I&#x27;m a prime candidate for frying hair haha    A little bit about this product however....  Remington seems to compare it a lot to professional systems, which it should not. Remington did not design this product actually. The original product patent is under Shaser Inc, Shaser Inc was formerly known as Shaser BioScience.  Shaser BioScience originally designed this as a 3rd party consultation separate from Remington and Spectrum Brands. Spectrum currently owns Shaser BioScience, known just as Shaser Inc now.  To add another twist to the tale Shaser Inc. currently has a lawsuit opened against it by Dr. Harvey Jay, a doctor whom has specialized in laser therapy for a number of things, in this particular case, hair removal.    The patents owned by Dr. Jay discussing the technology behind low-energy IPL are: US Patent  #6,824,542, # 6,916,316, #7,175,617, #7,553,308, and #8,393,330  The patents owned by Shaser Inc. discussing the actual product itself are: US D670397 S1 and US 8,480,721, among about 22 other language translations and variations    The reason I mention patents is because they reveal a huge quantity of information about this system and some really shifty advertising scams by Remington.  The hair reduction of 48% after 6 months that Remington quotes is from Smith et al. in the journal &#x27;Lasers in Medical Surgery&#x27;, titled \\&quot;Long-term results of hair photo-epilation\\&quot; published 1998.  I could not find any study done by Remington at all and the numbers coincidentally match up to the decimal so I assume that&#x27;s the study they quote. That was done using professional systems of course, and it was done over 15 years ago.    A little bit more about the patents.... In Dr. Jay&#x27;s patents he further explains that follicular damage is an UNINTENDED side effect of low-energy IPL. Any permanent removal is actually an accident and the system is designed not to do it. I&#x27;ll give a direct quote from Dr. Jay&#x27;s patents:  \\&quot;Thus, in contrast to prior methods, which are aimed at completely destroying the hair follicle, the present method contemplates only a partial destruction of the follicles or, alternatively, a destruction of the hair inside the follicles. In either case, the hair will grow and again appear on the treated surface in the absence of additional controlled light application\\&quot;    Now even more about the patents.... The nice thing about Remington not having actually designed this system but instead only facilitating the sale of it is that it&#x27;s quite easy to \\&quot;hack\\&quot; the machine. The little EEPROM chip inside every replacement xenon flash tube contains current # of flashes, total flashes, manufacturing date, and initial energy of the lamp.  The machine dynamically adapts the energy to the lamp, theoretically you could solder any xenon flash tube and the machine dynamically adapts to determine the required voltage and capacitance to output light. Very neat system actually. I was more impressed by that then what the product was actually intended to do since that&#x27;s actually some really complicated circuitry haha  You can hack the little EEPROM chip and as long as you leave a minimum of one property about the lamp then the system will run. You can wipe the flash count, energy, etc. and just leave the manufacturing date and you can get unlimited flashes (or at least until the bulb explodes). I just used Bus Pirate v3 to modify the eeprom chip, it&#x27;s a DS2431, one of the simplest EEPROM chips out there, very easy to read and modify. It can be modified by either bus pirate v3+, a raspberry pi, or an arduino fairly easily.  But if you do that be warned thateventually the bulb will literally explode. It&#x27;s housed fairly safe inside the machine so no glass really gets anywhere but if you&#x27;re scared of light bulbs exploding then don&#x27;t mess with the flash count.    The system is set to do 4 pulses of 7ms length at 3.5 Joules each, 3ms delay between pulses giving a total of 7 J/cm^2  The J/cm^2 is a value you will never see outside the pseudoscientific realm that is hair removal. In reality it&#x27;s 7 Watts of power not 7 Joules, a joule is a watt-second but you drop the second due to multiplying by the frequency hence giving watts... But anyway,The actual output is 14-16W of power. Due to the machines ability to dynamically adapt and the EEPROM containing modifications to energy output for each individual replacement bulb, Remington rated the system as between 7-8J/cm^2, meaning you&#x27;ll get between 14-16J (err... watts) in the 1x2cm filter window applied to your skin.    The pulse duration tends to burn the cathode and cause blackening of the tube because they use a very low quality xenon flash tube. Theoretically a good quality xenon flash tube at 7ms pulse duration should be able to survive 50,000+ pulses, sometimes even up to 1,000,000 if it&#x27;s a very good quality bulb. By good quality I mean a $4 bulb haha.  Xenon flash tubes that small aren&#x27;t exactly expensive. Remington really went out of their way to make sure you got a terrible product, I have no idea how they even managed to find such a horrible quality bulb. These bulbs do appear to be able to survive up to about 5000-6000 flashes from my experience thusfar before they simply explode or crack.    Also, in Dr. Jay&#x27;s patents he recommended between 5J/cm^2 to 40J/cm^2 of energy output to achieve satisfactory results, meaning for this system it is on the low end of that scale. He recommended 20J/cm^2 for people of coloured skin and the 40J/cm^2 for light skinned people. Those values would still only give temporary removal as well, it would not result in permanent follicle damage.    Now.... after all that rambling, did it work? Yes it seems to have removed my hair. Some of it still grows but a good portion has been removed.  Is it permanent? Well according to everything written about the technology it would appear to not be. IPL and laser themselves are not always permanent and given the low energy of this system it would suggest even more that it is not permanent.  I&#x27;d recommend this if you have a small area that  you want effectively kept hair free, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it for legs or total body hair removal however, you would spend a fortune on bulb replacements.  I gave it 3/5 because the price to quality just isn&#x27;t there. You&#x27;re paying a lot of money for what is essentially a glorified strobe light with a very poor quality and weak bulb that they slap a $5 700nm cutoff filter onto the front of and put it in a nice box. Then since they&#x27;re so nice to you after you&#x27;ve handed them over $200 for the unit, they&#x27;ve developed a way to really grab your money with the low flash count on the bulbs which they charge a huge markup on.  It&#x27;s up to you whether you think this system is worth the price to replace waxing or shaving, you&#x27;ll still need to shave much of the hair off since it can&#x27;t get all of it of course. If you did your complete body and didn&#x27;t mess around with the unit to unlock more flashes than I could easily see you using 5-6 bulbs/year, depending on how hairy you are I suppose. I had to flash every 2-4 days for the first month to see any real noticeable decrease in hair and I&#x27;m still flashing it about once a week and still need to shave many portions that this thing just can&#x27;t seem to deal with despite the dark hair.</li>
    <li> Women .. this is it! Facial hair - GONE! The magic takes place with just 4 sessions! I  bought it last year and it worked like magic on chin-hair. I had a few only but they were coarse and increasing &amp; causing me untold UNEASE. Such freedom for $200 is priceless. I read the reviews here where women experimented with using it on face and were successful. Glad I took the risk and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier. 3 months ago I took some hormones that brought the chin hair back! But with 3 more sessions, they are history. I had one hair come back and I removed it today, the 1st of Jan 2015. Whatsmore, I was daring enough to try it on cheek fuzz, which is not only fine but lighter hair that the machine does not claim to treat. But guess what, my cheeks are fuzz free as well for the last 2 months &amp; I only tried it twice on my cheeks and I did my cheeks a 3rd time today just to make sure that any leftover fuzz is gone. Whatsmore, I started out with #2 pain setting as it hurt if you switched it to 3 or 4. With a few sessions I was able to tolerate it up to the 3rd level and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all! So you grow tolerance for next levels so I&#x27;d advise to keep trying the next level every time you do it. But even with #2-3 .. I got GREAT results. Can&#x27;t praise this machine enough. I am also treating my underarm, arms and legs and seeing improvement. But the area I was most concerned about is already hairless, which is my face! Also, make sure you buy the Red Safety Glasses that are advertized along with it. Keep your eyes closed when you click it on your face. I keep a table-mirror handy so I know where I&#x27;m placing the &#x27;gun.&#x27; Once I point the gun in the right spot, I close my eyes even though I&#x27;m wearing safety glasses. I&#x27;ll come back to report how I&#x27;m doing on my face now. Hope the hair never comes back, will surely report further. I did make sure to buy a replacement bulb a few months back &amp; am using the 2nd cartridge and don&#x27;t mind spending on it at all. If you benefit from the machine &amp; these reviews, keep adding to the reviews. We gotta keep such products afloat. Finally, a magical device that&#x27;s not a gimmick or too good to be true. Good luck with a hair-free life of confidence. Your prayers have been answered!!!</li>
    <li> Their were to many, do not use this because off Dark spots are Dark skin, so We sent it back. I</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian and this one works very well on my skin. I use it for my underarms and want to try it on other areas. My tips are using a gel cold pack before starting the process so it won&#x27;t get hurt and using a moisturizer after that.</li>
    <li> I got the I-light Pro for Christmas and thought I would try it out on my bikini line.  I chose to only do one side so I could see the difference.  I used it two times (maybe 10 pulses each time) and a week or so after the second treatment I could really tell a difference.  It did hurt somewhat during the process, but they describe it correctly as a feeling of a rubberband popping against your skin.  Just depends on the sensitivity of your skin, but it was bearable.  This morning I went to use it for my 3rd treatment and one flash went off and it wouldn&#x27;t flash again.  I looked up the troubleshooting and it said it might have a defective bulb.  That is ridiculous.  Now I have to pay $25 for a new cartridge when it is brand new and maybe used for 20 pulses (supposed to be 1000 - 1500).  I have emailed the Remington customer service to see if they will send me a new bulb for free.  I&#x27;ll keep this updated if they do.  I must say however, I was very pleased with the product \\&quot;when it was working\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and saw the thing about the bulb, I thought of a cleaver way to reset the system so you get full use of your new bulb. Unplug the bulb before you ever turn it on then turn it on and an alarm will sound. Turn it back off put the bulb back in and turn it back on.. I did that and have used my bulb like crazy and have not had one failure.. woo hoo!! the hair looks like its going away but I have only used it twice so ill have to wait and report later..xoxo</li>
    <li> My wife says this is starting to work as described.....she enjoys the product.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this for my wife and I gave it a try too for my chest hair and my armpits. My wife went to a salon 3 years ago for her legs and bikini area and after spending thousands of dollars she was very happy with the results. After 3 years she had very little hair growing in the areas that she treated (like less than 1%). When she saw this on amazon she thought she&#x27;d give it a try as it actually costs less than one session in a salon.  After 3 sessions, the results are comparable to what she got 3 years ago in the salon. Compared to the professional systems this removes about 20% less hair in the same number of sessions. However, for the cost of this machine and the replacement cartridges, this is way more than expected and it&#x27;s definitely worth a few extra sessions for all your hair to fall out.  For my chest hair - after 2 sessions I got it down to like 40% of what it used to be. I&#x27;m confident that it will all go away afer a few more tries. So thumbs up there too!</li>
    <li> It does seem to work at reducing the need to shave but it does not completely remove the hair permanently.  I had use it for over two years bought four refill cartridges as long as I used it weekly the hair did not come back.  I stopped for three months and the hair did come back though there was less. I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Like others have said, it is a great product and I have noticed visible results in the growth of my hair. It does not grow as fast and is slightly thinner! That said, holding it is hard and awkward... but so worth it!</li>
    <li> Some of the hair looks a little thinned out, but still grows back the same, just not as dark. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be working. Thinking of trying the Nono Pro...</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it .It has changed her life it was very hard for her having hair on her face this system has helped her so much even thou it wasn&#x27;t made to use on the face&#x27;</li>
    <li> This actually works. I used it a couple a times a week and it reduces hair growth dramatically.</li>
    <li> it does not works for me,  and my skin feel uncomfortable when I use it. ...do not purchase it. l</li>
    <li> I was excited to use the Remington IPL device because I am, well, rather hairy and have sensitive skin.  I was hoping to reduce my hair and have to shave less frequently, with smoother results.  I got the device on Tuesday and used it to treat my armpits.  It was easy to use and I was able to use it on level 5, the highest level, with no discomfort.  After a flash all I felt was a slight warmness and tingling for a few seconds.  I had no blistering or irritation to my very sensitive skin later on.  What was great is that I usually itch a lot after shaving, but with the treatment from the Remington IPL I have&#x27;t itched at all.    Today (Thursday) I went to use the device on my bikini line and after a few flashes, it quit working.  The device was unlocked, the green light was on for the bulb and I pressed the flash button, but no flash happened.  I called customer service and they recommended that I take the tip off and clean the window inside and out, but it was to no avail.    I called customer service again and they are sending me a shipping label to send the device in for testing.    OK so I edited this review to add that I tried cleaning the tip again, and plugging it into a different outlet, and it works again!  No need to send it in for testing.  I&#x27;m already seeing some slight results from the first treatment.  I will update this review again when I have been using it for longer and can speak to the long term results.    2-MONTH UPDATE  I have been using the device on level 5 on my bikini area every other week faithfully for the past two months.  The hair is finer and softer, and there is slightly less of it.  I would say it is about a 30% reduction in hair.  It&#x27;s nothing miraculous, but I find it easier to shave now.  I will continue to treat every two weeks.  I wish I had more drastic results, but I know I need to be patient.</li>
    <li> I love this device. It burns through all hair follicles. Removing even stubborn ear hairs. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, love it.</li>
    <li> For the last ten years, I have been an adult woman struggling with unwanted facial hair. I am mixed race with light skin, but the hairs on my chin and throat are thick, wiry, and black. A decade ago, it was just a few hairs, but as of five years ago, it was enough that I had to switch to shaving, partly to save time, and partly to reduce the number of ingrown hairs that would result. These ingrown hairs have to be dug out in order to be removed, and have caused many blemishes. Furthermore, it&#x27;s painful and embarrassing. I try to avoid well-lit places, I keep my head down even when I laugh, and I won&#x27;t let myself be seen without makeup. I even tried to avoid having anyone touch my face for fear they would feel my bristly five o&#x27;clock shadow. I have despaired over this, felt helpless, powerless, and miserable over it. I have felt constantly ashamed at having to shave my face like a man. Honestly, it made me feel like less of woman and my self-esteem (never amazing to begin with) has suffered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could never afford laser treatments at the salon, and I had heard that some mixed race skin tones were too dark, anyway. When I first heard about it, I considered NoNo, but only until I read the terrible reviews. Finally, a commercial for the Tria home laser changed my life (bear with me here, I know this is a review for the Remington). I never dreamed that something at home could work for me or my skin/hair type, but I did my research anyway. The reviews for the Tria were good, mostly, but more than a few people mentioned the Remington Pro IPL, and that it worked as well if not better, was less expensive, and had been on the market for a few years. I pored over the reviews (thank you TheRealWoman!!!), and despite the fact that the product is not recommended for the face, many, many customers confessed to using it there with amazing results. Just like that, I went from feeling like I had a guilty secret to hide from the world, to feeling like I was part of a community; on top of that, while I didn&#x27;t want to build up my hopes too much, I dreamed of being close to a solution to what I had dubbed The Nightmare of My Life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Remington on my freshly shaven face, on the Level 3 setting, every other day for a month now. In order to really gauge light bulb life, I have used it exclusively on my primary problem areas, my chin and neck and (slight) mustache. I have also taken advice from other reviewers: I clean the laser window frequently, and give it 3-4 seconds in-between pulses to keep the bulb from overheating. I don&#x27;t know if it helps, but it makes sense. Each session is approximately 40-50 pulses and takes me approximately 15 minutes, and so far I am still using the original bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I didn&#x27;t detect any changes, but now, in my fourth week, I can see major progress. I don&#x27;t need to do my mustache area anymore. To be fair, it was never plentiful or thick, but now you can no longer see the hair follicles or any growth. I am going to stop treating it and see if/when it grows back. Now my neck and chin...other reviewers reported noticeable results at two weeks. After four weeks, I can feel and see the difference. In the morning, before I shave, I feel fewer hairs. I still shave every day because I still have growth, but I believe this has a lot to do with growth cycles. I have had many ingrown hairs that I had to tweeze even while the majority were shaved off, so my growth cycle is currently all over the map. While I still do the whole area, it&#x27;s starting to become apparent that hair is only growing noticeably in patches, mostly in the same places where I had frequent ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot describe how incredible these results feel. If you&#x27;ve struggled with facial hair as a woman, you know how much it undermines your confidence, your enjoyment of life, your spontaneity. I feel like I can go camping again! Better yet, I feel like I can wake up next to someone and not run for the bathroom and the razor. I&#x27;m getting my life back and it feels absolutely amazing. (One more word about the price tag: If you&#x27;re considering buying this, do it. I know I didn&#x27;t mention it, but the price really scared me off, even though it was considerably cheaper than the Tria. But when I thought about what I would pay to be free of this nightmare, what I would pay for this to work, I realized the amount is a pittance. So far, I&#x27;m over the moon. If it continues like this/gets better, then that&#x27;s the bee&#x27;s knees. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t buy this sooner! And if you&#x27;re still reading this novel, do yourself a favor and be free, too. What&#x27;s two hundy, really, in the grand scheme of your happiness?)my life back and it feels absolutely amazing.

    <li> wouild work on face returned it</li>
    <li> Ok.  I have waited for 3 months to post a review.  I can say that I have used it as others have on here for my face almost every other day since October and the hair is about 75% reduced.  While this may not seem like a total win, the stubble is so much less, that I feel I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;take care of it&amp;#34; upon waking.  I can wait till mid day after working out and don&#x27;t feel like the bearded lady.  My hair was primarily on the chin area.  I will continue to use this and while I know it will probably not get rid of all, it got rid of enough to make it worth the price.  It may seem steep, but this is the price of one laser treatment(which I did 10 of with no results).  Well worth it.  Initial bulb is still working great!  Would have given it 5 if I was hair free, but still a good product!</li>
    <li> I have had professional laser hair removal sessions before. And it takes 5 -7 sessions before you get close to no hair. I have had about 4 professional sessions on my lower legs and get sporadic hair here and there. I probably needed to pay for 2 additional sessions. Well this little machine took care of it for me. With my first session with this machine, I got the same results  that I had with the professional sessions. The hair \\&quot;grew/fell\\&quot; out and then I didn&#x27;t have any hair. Instead of paying for 2 more sessions on my legs, I now have a machine that I can use whenever and where ever I need. I love this thing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman with dark, coarse chin hair. I have 3 choices--pluck (which causes a lot of acne), go to a laser hair removal clinic$$$, or a product like this$. I&#x27;ve done the first two already. $300 later, initially I was disappointed because I didn&#x27;t think this product was working. After about 3-4 weeks, I was super pleased to see noticed much less hair, and now most all of the dark, coarse chin hairs are gone. It&#x27;s extremely fast to use and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all (but I have a pretty high pain threshold). I also have moderately dark lip hair, and it&#x27;s doing a so-so job on that. Yay!</li>
    <li> I got this two months ago and the results are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I have very light pale skin.  My leg hairs have always been really thick and dark and even when I shaved you could see my thick hairs :(. Waxing was too painful and expensive. I got this and used it once every two weeks on high setting and after 2 treatments I could see a huge improvement. After 2 months of treatments there is almost no hair and my legs look smooth and nice. The light that removes the hair on the highest setting feel like split second of a small rubber band snapping on the skin. I also don&#x27;t have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> 10/16/16 EDIT: This worked GREAT when I first starting using it roughly 5 years ago before I became pregnant with my 1st born.  I was only able to use it for a few months then I became pregnant so I stopped using it.  Because I was too busy after my child was born I stopped using it.  I recently (within the past 6 months) have used it a few times because I wanted to start back up and it died.  It just won&#x27;t work.  I am very bummed because overall (even though there was a 4 year gap in between), I barely got 6 months to 1 year&#x27;s worth of use but the warranty is over because it is a 2 year warranty.  I changed my star to 1.  Very disappointed because the product works well on hair removal but the product itself died with minimal usage.  BUMMED OUT.  Original Review: Ok first I am a little annoyed that I purchased this only 2 weeks ago for $50 more than it is now offered.  But oh well.  I am a former Tria owner (overall not impressed!) and the frustration with the Tria and its tiny laser head and short battery life led me to purchase this unit which doesn&#x27;t need to be charged and has a bigger laser head.  The downside of this unit is that you have to purchase refills for $25/each.  I used 1 1/2 cartridges for 1 treatment session for my full legs.  So I&#x27;m thinking after spending $250 on the product, and about 5 cartridges I will have spent for the full 3 treatments $375 to just do my legs...but that&#x27;s still cheaper than professional laser services for your legs.  I do think it also comes with a 90 day guarantee although I have to check the fine print again.  I will try to return it within that time frame if I don&#x27;t see results.  You also need to read the fine print when it advertises that the cartridge is enough for 3 sessions of body (it is counting your body as lower legs, forearms, and bikini areas I think).  So yeah that would make sense, but seeing that there is a lot of surface area for your FULL legs expect to use a little more than 1 cartridge each time.  And Idon&#x27;t have that much surface area on my legs compared to others as my legs are thin, although I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; so perhaps if I was shorter it wouldn&#x27;t take as many cartridges.  I&#x27;ve done my legs twice and I&#x27;m not sure yet if I&#x27;m seeing a difference.  I think I might be, but I really can&#x27;t tell yet.  I am the perfect candidate for laser (light skin, dark/thick hair) and have done professional laser hair removal in the past.  Also, please remember that even professional laser hair removal isn&#x27;t permanent :( unfortunately.  I can tell you that all of the areas I&#x27;ve done professionally have grown back in to some degree.  Anyways, seeing as it takes 2 weeks sometimes for hair to fall out, it is way too soon to tell if this works seeing as it has only been 1 week after my 2nd leg session.  I do love the convenience of this product in that you don&#x27;t have to wait around for it to recharge.  The laser head is so much bigger than the Tria too.  It is painful, why would anyone think it wouldn&#x27;t be.  But it is tolerable.  Although I have done waxing, professional laser hair removal, electrolysis, you name it, so my pain tolerance has increased quite a bit.  I will give an update when enough time has passed for me to know if this has worked.  PS the light is VERY bright - I close my eyes or look away when it pulses as it honestly does feel like it is going to hurt my eyes even if it says it is not.  It scared the crap out of one of my cats!</li>
    <li> I purchased this through Groupon back in December.  I have only done a few treatments on my lower legs and underarms, at the highest setting.  I have gone through 2 cartridges.  After the last cartridge burned out in February, I put the machine away.  The cartridges did not last as long as indicated.  I only got 2 treatments from each cartridge.  I could easily go through 1-2 a month at this rate.  At $25 each, that&#x27;s a lot a money!  Plus, I have to shave with this machine.  I feel waxing &amp; epilating give better, longer lasting results.  Save your money &amp; purchase a good quality epilator.</li>
    <li> I bought the Remington IPL6000 I Light Pro after seven sessions with an IPL method, in a private, certified salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flashes feel more comfortable than the one I tried in the saloon and it&#x27;s way cheaper. These are, from my point of view, the two differences between the proffesional method and this DIY method.&lt;br /&gt;The instructional video is quite good and it&#x27;s better to watch it before getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I already had fewer hair when I started but my goal is accomplished: I wanted something to do the maintenance, and this one works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this 9 weeks ago, and have used it roughly every 10-12 days (admittedly, a little more frequently than the once every two weeks the package recommends), with the goal of getting rid of all of the hair on my chest and abdomen, just for fun. I wanted to be able to feel my wife skin-on-skin without all of my hair in the way. I have pale skin, and black hair; basically the ideal skin/hair combo for this product, so beware that if your skin is darker or your hair is lighter, you may either have more pain, or less results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each treatment takes about 45 min to 1 hour, if you include the time to shower/shave first, zap zap zap everywhere, and then rinse off in the shower to be rid of the slight smell of burnt hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zapping itself is not bad. I use level five (the highest) all the time. This is about one-tenth of the pain of epilation (I&#x27;ve tried an epilator a few times, and I always quit after a few square inches, because the pain is much too intense). The description of a rubber band flicking the skin somewhat fits, but there is definitely some brief feeling of heat as well. If you&#x27;ve ever had wax dripped onto you, each time you press the button feels like that sensation, but only for a very brief split second, and then the pain is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The treatment window is narrow, and it is a bit hard to tell what you&#x27;ve already zapped sometimes. Fortunately, it does seem to cause a mild redness around the follicle (which has lasted up to two days) so that helps to see where you&#x27;ve zapped. But I definitely do miss spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am on my second (first replacement) bulb. Interestingly, the directions say the bulb maintains at least 90% of its intensity for the full 1500 flashes, but in fact, I found that when I changed bulbs, there was a dark appearance to half of the bulb I took out, as if it had been partially burned out, and the new replacement bulb was much stronger than the bulb I had just replaced. If you are spending this sort of money, I recommend always keeping a back-up bulb handy, in case your bulb has some unexpected problems. It seems from the other reviews like that is pretty common.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I didn&#x27;t really notice much results until about 7-10 days after my second session. Then, it was obvious that this thing was working. Nine weeks in, I&#x27;d say 70-80% of my hair is either completely gone or so fine as to be irrelevant, and I started out with coarse hair and a lot of it. I usually shave twice a week now, just to clean up the leftover hairs a bit, but even if I go a week without shaving, the hair is fine enough that it is not unpleasant. Shaving used to be unpleasant when so much coarse hair would start to grow back, but now, it is not a bother at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how long the results are going to last, but I do know that this is less painful than epilation or waxing, and probably at least as durable. And cheaper than laser by a good bit. So no, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but for light skin and dark hair, it is definitely the best option out there, and it has been well worth the purchase price in terms of the fun it has been to have a hairless front. If this product wasn&#x27;t out there, I&#x27;d just choose to be hairy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten professional laser hair removal about 5 years ago. I started noticing the hair coming back. Although it was sparse, I thought I&#x27;d give this a try and save lot&#x27;s of money. After reading the reviews, I bought it. I am SO happy I did. I have black hair and olive skin, and since I haven&#x27;t been in the sun, my skin&#x27;s light enough to use this product. Love the skin tone indicator, so you won&#x27;t burn yourself :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after the first treatment, the hairs on my legs are falling out. Compared to the pain of professional treatments being a 10, the pain scale of this laser on the highest setting is about a 6. I can see the area&#x27;s I missed, and it&#x27;ll be easy to go over them and be silky smooth in another two weeks. Awesome on the bikini line! Awesome on underarms! Awesome on my belly (yeah, pretty hairy lol) but if you&#x27;re like me, PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY! It sounds silly, but it really makes a HUGE difference in day to day life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been two months now and I have 1 little spot left on my knee that I just zapped before I wrote this review...so give me two weeks and I&#x27;ll be hair free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY it and ENJOY!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this through amazon in march 2012, and i&#x27;ve been using this for under arm and bikini line area. I have tan color skin, with darker color around bikini area, and very dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I treated my under arms once every 2 weeks in the first 2 months, i do however treat my bikini line area once in a week, since the hairs in that area seems growing faster than those in my under arms. It maybe due to the darker color on the skin. And i had never shaved that area before, and the hairs on this area was so coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Also i notice, it didnt hurt to bad, when you treat on lighter skin. It stings a little bit more when you treat darker skin. I use moisturizer gel everytime after i did my treatment. First 2 times, i used setting no. 3. Now, i can go all the way to 5 on under arms, and 4 on bikini.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result, as per mid june 2012;  my under arms : hairs grow a lot slower, and if it does, the hair is a lot finer. Now i just treat this area as needed.&lt;br /&gt;For bikini line, i still treat this area once a week. But with coarser hairs, and darker skin in this area, I think this is acceptable, plus, this is only my third months. But the hairs is definitely grow slower. So i am optimist about the result. Also i ordered 2 more cartridges just in case, but right now i&#x27;m still using the original cartridge that come with the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, i am very please with this product, and it definetely works for me..</li>
    <li> I used it once and the cartridge wasted on a small area on my face... it doesn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;d order something else and save my money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different types of at home hair removal products over the years and have always been disappointed - until now.  I&#x27;ve been using the Remington IPL for a month now.  And to be honest I use it twice a week.  Usually Wednesday and Sunday.  (Picked arbitrarily).  And wow what a difference it has made.  I have very fair skin and medium brown hair.  And treated my whole body.  The hair that was the darkest were the first to go.  Which only makes sense but there has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair everywhere.  The hair on my legs for example is more sparse and seems to take much longer to grow out.  And the hair on my arms are completely gone.  Not sure why the difference unless I missing spots on my legs because there is more are to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that suprised me is that I got 6 full body treatments instead of the 2 or 3 advertised out of one IPL cartridge before I had to replace it.  All in all I think it is a fabulous product and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have a very high pain tolerance (I can even pierce my own ears), but, I tested this IPL unit on my underarms at the lowest setting and it felt like being stabbed with a hundred sewing needles (I had even used numbing cream and I took Tylenol before I started). I am the perfect candidate for IPL: light skin with dark hair, so I kept going thinking I would \\&quot;get used to it.\\&quot;  WRONG! Although waxing hurts, this is way worse.  It was even worse than getting a tattoo removed.  If I was someone who cried a lot, there would have been tears.  Instead, my kids learned some \\&quot;colorful\\&quot; new words from their mother.  Save your money and look for deals at local laser hair removal clinics.  A ND:YAG, or Diode laser doesn&#x27;t hurt half as bad and the light is more focused/direct, so the treatment works better.  I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal on my face and it worked great.  Then I thought I could save money by doing the rest of my body with this device.  Bad IDEA!</li>
    <li> I am pretty fair-skinned, so I was fairly confident this would work for me. I have been using it about once a week on the highest setting for a little over a month now, and I can definitely see patchy bald spots and less hair growth in all of my treatment areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of my least favorite aspects:&lt;br /&gt;1) It is a little painful to use; it reminds me of a very strong static shock.&lt;br /&gt;2) The skin tone sensor design is flawed. Once I get close enough for it to detect the color of my skin I block out all of the light and it rejects my skin tone as too dark. I finally got so frustrated with it that I started using a piece of white paper to override the sensor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not experience any issues with my cartridge burning out prematurely that other reviewers mentioned. Original cartridge is still going strong!</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered early.</li>
    <li> Description of product does not clearly state device should not be used on face</li>
    <li> After almost two years I had problem with the cone of my device.  I called Remington, they verified the warranty, I returned the device with free ahipment and I received a new device in a week.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Remington!</li>
    <li> Daughter-in-law really liked this gift.  Says it works.</li>
    <li> The product is great and worked its magic well... for a while. The treated areas remain hairless now, but, after only 2 sessions ( about 50-60 pulses) It&#x27;s out! I thought it was supposed to have some thousand charges.</li>
    <li> The cartridge doesnt last! And it hurts too much. This is not a good product!!</li>
    <li> Okay, I watched the video and used as directed. Nothing happened...my hair grew back normally. I even bought new lights thinking the one that came with it might&#x27;ve been weak. I tried for six weeks like it said. The hair on my arms has come back darker and thicker. The hair on my legs and bikini lines are continuing to grow. I saw no reduction in hair growth. I was planning on taking it back last week but thought I&#x27;d give it one more try. I did treat one leg during this trial time and not the other throughout the six weeks to see if there was any difference. I did not see one. In fact, the leg I treated my husband said seemed hairier.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the light is so small, it takes a while to treat an entire leg and then there is no way to tell if you covered every square inch of it. After four weeks I was disappointed and came back here reading the reviews where people said to be patient that it took a good six weeks to see a major difference. After eight weeks, I thought surely there would be less hair growth. What a big disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I did accidentally hit my husband&#x27;s tattoo with it, which blistered badly. Once it healed the color was gone. I guess one could use it as a tattoo remover but I wouldn&#x27;t do it unless under doctors watchful eye because his spot took a long time to heal and looked very painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man with pretty dark thick hair and if it works for me I&#x27;m pretty sure it will work for anyone, but it will probably take longer than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, don&#x27;t buy the protective goggles as they are not necessary. The light is safe and it says so on the manual. I don&#x27;t think the anesthetic creams are necessary either. I have pretty sensitive skin and the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; is perfectly tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for almost everything: chest, neck, back of my head, back, beard and arms. It is important to say that they don&#x27;t suggest to use it on the neck and above.&lt;br /&gt;The most important thing you should know is that the thicker the hair the longer it will take to work and the hair won&#x27;t die at first. It will get thinner and thinner until it disappears. But this can take more than 10 applications depending on the thickness of the hair and the hair density of the area. For example: I have used twice in my arm pit and there is less hair and they are thinner than before. I have used 5 times on my beard and the change is minimum. You have to be very patient.&lt;br /&gt;Another important thing: the lamp bulb seems to last less than promised. They say it lasts 1500 flashes but I guess it lasts only 500.</li>
    <li> It is exactly one month since I bougth this product. I have done two treatments so far and I am happy with the results! I have done laser treatment on my underarm several years ago and I know exactly what kind of results you should expect after each session. Comparing to the treatments you get at a center, this product has a weaker laser power but if you are patient enough, you will undoubtedly see the roots falling off! Besides the price is not comparable to the sessions at a center!  Highly recommend it! I will try to update this review in few weeks or months.</li>
    <li> before i bought this item i tried everything.&lt;br /&gt;i spent more than $3000 just on hair removal products including in office, professional ones.&lt;br /&gt;nothing worked and the different companies always had their excuses and ways to suck more money out of my pocket.&lt;br /&gt;when i bought the Remington IPL i could see results and hair reduction within the first month.i love this and even when something went wrong the customer service sent me a new one right away.</li>
    <li> Great Product..... bought it, along with a backup cartridge for 269.99 here on Amazon back in April.  Has worked great for first few months, and my honest surprise came at how long the first (included) cartridge lasted!  I got lots of use out of the first cartridge and it lasted me for quite awhile.  However after I put in a replacement cartridge is when I shortly afterward experienced an unfortunate malfunction of the product itself.  Oddly, I tried using it one day and the product mysteriously and randomly began quitting on me during treatment, giving out at will it seemed.  I do not come to any other conclusion as to why the product would give out, especially because it is plugged into an outlet.  For this reason, and also because there is nothing I believe that resulted from my misuse of the product, but rather on the quality of the product itself, I am hoping Remington will see eye to eye with me and refund my purchase as it is within the two-year time period, and it is their product that began to give out on its own.  I am not sure if there is a disconnect inside the product that may have to do with it giving out?  It seems to me that there is a disconnection of the wire cable or something.... I intend to send it back, along with my Amazon product order summary.  Great product.... hopefully I can say the same for their customer service.</li>
    <li> Returned it. CANNOT be used on face.</li>
    <li> I do not know about long term use. Even on the low setting it was painful. But this is just my experience.</li>
    <li> Its been 45 days and I see absolutely no difference. I&#x27;m a pale woman with almost black hair and it hasn&#x27;t worked. I am not expecting total hairless results after 45 days, but I expected something. If anything my hair got thicker. Save your money. I really wanted this to work but it doesn&#x27;t. If I see actual results after this review I will update but so far I believe I got scammed.</li>
    <li> I just bought the Remington i-Light 6000.&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and my hair is light brown.&lt;br /&gt;I put my arm in the testing spot and it buzzes and the light turns yellow. My mom who has darker skin than I does the exact same thing and it beeps and the light turns green.&lt;br /&gt;I know that if you have dark skin you can&#x27;t use this product, but I have the lightest skin ever. (In fact all of the makeup I try on is too dark even in the lightest shade; so I have to buy white makeup to mix with the lightest shade.)&lt;br /&gt;SO BOTTOM LINE IS BEWARE BECAUSE IF YOUR SKIN IS LIGHTER THAN NORMAL IT WON&#x27;T WORK!</li>
    <li> I had read the reviews on several products and decided to go with this one and am very glad that I did.  I had also seen a reply from Remington and that gave me confidence that Remington stands by its product and cares what customers think and that meant a lot.  It has been a little over a month of use and I can tell a big difference.  My hair is growing back patchy and so now I am targeting the areas that are growing back.  I am seeing better results than I thought that I would.  I bought an extra cartridge since some reviews mentioned that the first cartridge did not last long.  I am still on the first cartridge and I have used it three times on my bikini area and my lower legs.  I have also used it on my chin and upper lip and had positive results even though it was not recommended for this area.  Since this is not as strong as the lasers in the salon I was prepared to be patient to see results.  I was very surprised to see how patchy my hair is growing back and how good the results are after just this short period.  I would absolutely recommend this product for the convenience of doing it at home, the price compared to get it done at the salon, the short time it takes to use the product, and the great results that I am seeing.</li>
    <li> OK, first, I am a freak about having smooth legs.  I used to shave every day, including the days I gave birth.  It&#x27;s possible I was a bit compulsive about it.  So I picked up the iLight home hair-removal system with high hopes for kicking the shaving habit.  Six months after first use, my legs are hairless and have been for more than a month.  Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE:  In short, you shave your legs and then dry them.  Right after shaving, you hold the hand-held zapper against your leg, a chime sounds if you have good contact, you push a button, and a light flashes.  Repeat everywhere you want to remove hair.  It takes longer than shaving, but it&#x27;s not bad (maybe 20 minutes for both legs), and you can do it on the couch, in bed, wherever.  It does not hurt, at all, but it does feel warm where the contacts touch your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EXPERIENCE:  I did my right leg first, so as to compare.  Following the directions, I did treatment one, then treatment two 2 weeks later, and treatment three 2 weeks after that (completing 3 treatments in a month).  After that first month I noticed a lot less regrowth, and started the cycle on my left leg.  After the first 3 treatments on each leg I started using it on an as-needed basis, which I needed with decreasing frequency.  And now, I haven&#x27;t shaved or used the iLight for about a month.  Hurray!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Follow the directions, have patience, and you will soon be tossing your razors. (NOTE:  Suitable only for light to medium skin tones.)</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my wife in January 2012, and she was able to get some results on her underarms; however, she didn&#x27;t find the required patience to go any further. Fortunately, the folks at Remington&#x27;s guaranty are super understanding, the kind that guaranties used to be like. We understand that personal care products are extremely sophisticated, and they may not work for everyone just the same. We are happy that we at least gave it a shot.</li>
    <li> I think this is a very, very difficult item to review. Everyone&#x27;s experience with it will vary; it will NOT produce the same results for everyone. Would be great if it did, but that&#x27;s just not the case. I find that reading ALL instructions are important and knowing the devices limitations are key, too. Nothing on the planet promises PERMANENT HAIR REMOVAL except for traditional needle-in-each-pore electrolysis. Laser, or IPL can at best promise PERMANENT HAIR REDUCTION and that&#x27;s only if 1) you have the right skin type, 2) you have dark enough hair and 3) you manage to hit the hair during the right growth cycle in order to \\&quot;damage\\&quot; it. Tip: read about the three phases of hair growth to understand why you have to \\&quot;zap\\&quot; it in the ANAGEN growth phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a facial hair problem since my teens and I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market from bleach (imagine being told from a boy in middle school that your bleached-blonde moustache makes you look like Hulk Hogan), to hair removal cream, to electrolysis, to laser, to plucking and finally, in my 30s, I just starting shaving it because it was easy and cheap. I long ago lost any hint of shame in being a woman who shaves her face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve tried it all. Electrolysis worked, but was extremely painful and left me with pitting and scars. IPL/laser worked, to some degree, but is very cost prohibitive and most places want to sign you up for some complex package that is priced depending on what day of the week it is. Plucking works, but it&#x27;s a weekly thing and I had SO many hairs that it took forever. The creams burned and smelled. Bleach? Yeah, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to see this device on the market for a fraction of what I was about to pay (again) for five treatments at a local clinic ($800 - $1100 for treating my face and upper neck). I figured for $250, I&#x27;d take that gamble. Yes, I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be as powerful, but I would have complete control and I liked that. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note here that I&#x27;m 36, female, medium-skinned, brown hair and have dark stubble. Though this device is NOT cleared for face or neck, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using it for. I didn&#x27;t know this until I was reading the brochure. So, there&#x27;s that. I am treating my upper lip, chin, cheeks and upper neck. I just close my eyes when the device flashes and keep it away from my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the device for about three and a half months now, about every 10 days (which is more than recommended). I have it cranked up to max settings. The pain level, for me, is very tolerable. I think that&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had so much done to my face over the years. Even at max settings, I don&#x27;t even flinch using this device. The first time I used it, I was completely red and blotchy. I applied some lidocream and was good to go in about an hour. After treatment two, I have no real redness or blotchyness. It&#x27;s quite possible my skin is actually made of bologna.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is extremely easy to use. I wish the sensor area was bigger though. Of course, that would make zapping some areas on my face hard, so...maybe not. And the \\&quot;skin color detector\\&quot; is oddly-placed; holding the device up to your inner thigh is going to be extremely awkward if that&#x27;s the area you&#x27;re treating. ;) I just place the back of my hand on it and \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the device that way. Treating my face/chin/neck takes about 5 mins. I have had no issues with the device or the cartridge. I&#x27;d estimate I&#x27;ve put about 300 flashes on it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, here&#x27;s the tl;dr (\\&quot;too long, didn&#x27;t read): it works, to a point. I have less dark, thick hairs. I&#x27;m still shaving, but if I miss a few days, no biggie. I would even argue that some hairs have appears to stay on permanent vacation. At this point, I would say my overall hair situation on the treated areas is 65% better. And for $250, I&#x27;m happy with that.here that I&#x27;m 36, female, medium-skinned, brown hair and have dark stubble.

    <li> I have been using this since March 2012.  I live in a beach town and am on the beach a few times a week during the summer months.  This was the first summer I was able to wear a bathing suit without board shorts.  I had no ingrown hairs, red razor bumps or razor rash, even after shaving  without a new blade.  Ingrown hairs just don&#x27;t happen anymore and the hair that does grow back is much lighter and finer. I bought this product mainly for the bikini area and if it worked on my legs and underarms then great.  For me, it did a great job on my underarms and bikini area and just an ok job on my legs.  I now use this every 14 days and have to shave once a week and legs maybe twice.  This product is great and enabled me to enjoy the beach with my daughter and not be self conscious or preoccupied with something as ridiculous as ones bikini area.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal in the past (about 10 years ago) on my lower legs and wanted to do some touch up work on a few spots that still get some hair, as well as my upper legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this is a fraction of what it would cost for a professional to do it, but that&#x27;s about the only great thing about this.  After using it as directed, I feel that there was a very slight reduction in hair growth time, but for the amount of time that it took, I didn&#x27;t see any overwhelming results.  I was still getting hair growth in the spots that I had treated, even though I was using it at the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cartridge didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the manual leads you to believe, and there was nothing more frustrating than getting one leg done and having the cartridge die on you and no replacement cartridge to slip in.  (My fault for not ordering one with it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait for a Groupon for laser hair removal and just leave it to the pros.</li>
    <li> Used for 9 mths. Perfect candidate. Still no results</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon. I got it cheaper via another website ($215). I brought this to use on my facial hair even though it says not to. I&#x27;m a male with dark hair/fair skin color. The first time i used it I seemed to work. Some hairs came right out when tested with tweezer. But after using it more it just didn&#x27;t seem to be working well. I gave up when I saw a Groupon for a 6 professional laser hair treatments for $130. After my first treatment getting laser i noticed a heck of a difference. Half my face is already hairless. I ended up selling my remington on ebay. CHECK GROUPON &amp; SAVE WITH BETTER RESULTS...</li>
    <li> I am writing this review to prevent people from the same mistake I made.  I have had laser hair removal on my armpits and bikini area and bought this hoping to get similar results on my legs.  I bought this product for myself as a holiday present in Dec 2011.  I followed the intructions exactly.  I though it maybe was helping, and I was willing to repeat the process forever until the hair was gone.  But since I have a scientific background, I decided to do  casual experiment instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I treated my left leg only, and left my right leg alone, for six treatments.  THen I counted the number of hairs within a 2x2 area on each leg.  Now this was after the initial 6 week treatment on both legs, but I really could not tell if it was doing anything.  Yes some hairs fell out, but did they come back?  And will more fall out with more treatments?  Well the short answer is after six more treatments, there was only a very slight difference between my left leg and my right leg.  This product can not deliver the smooth skin shown on the models on the box.  THe hair IS slightly less dense.  But so what? I still have to shave just as often, had to buy THREE cartriges (they do not last nearly as long as stated), and now have this dumb machine taking up space in my home after wasting $250 on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also- disposal of the cartriges in an environmentaly responsible manner takes an extra effort. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shaving less and less and have only used the product 3 times.</li>
    <li> I bought to use on chin hairs.  Details on the item does not say not for use on the face.</li>
    <li> This product works, but it works very slowly and you&#x27;re better off going for professional laser hair removal. My biggest complaint with this product is Remington&#x27;s misrepresentation on the cartridge lifespan (which incurs high follow-up costs) and the terrible customer service. The cartridge is supposed to last 1,500 flashes per bulb, but my cartridge burned out after approx 400 flashes. When I contacted Amazon (whose service I have no complaints about), Amazon informed me that this is such a common problem that Remington has a phone service line dedicated for calls on such defects and gave me their number.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I called that number and described the issue to the lady on the line, not only was she extremely rude, but she said the only solution was for me to pay to mail the cartridge to Remington, and after a few weeks of \\&quot;investigating\\&quot;, they may mail me a replacement if they find that it was a mechanical issue on their part.  OK, first of all 1) Remington knows this is a widespread problem, so this is how they address a defective design on their part? 2) They want the consumer to pay and go through the hassle of shipping a defective cartridge back to them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering this because you think it&#x27;ll be a convenient and cheaper alternative to professional laser hair removal, then don&#x27;t purchase this system. Not only are the results temporary and spotty at best, but you&#x27;ll be spending much more than the initial $200.  The cartridges don&#x27;t last as long as promised, and you&#x27;ll need to buy $20 cartridges many times over. In the end, you&#x27;ll mostly be losing your $ to Remington and not losing much hair.</li>
    <li> Seems to work really well. I started doing only my right leg, never did the left one at all, and I can see quite a bit more hair on the leg that was never treated. I have in the past tried the Tria, and that did NOT work at all for me. I&#x27;m using the Remington from time to time, not religiously, and very pleased with the results. By the way, I am using it at the highest setting, and my skin is somewhat tan, not the milky white type of skin. This setting doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin and the level of discomfort during the flashes is minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first light bulb lasted about 2 long sessions when I did most of my right leg, as well as my left armpit. While it costs $24 for a new bulb, I feel like it&#x27;s a good deal because I would spend WAY more than that if I were to get my legs waxed at a salon, or get laser treatments. I have been shaving my legs, but will let the hair grow and take pictures so I can post them here and show the difference in growth between my two legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome piece of equipment!!! Since it arrived i&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;ve accomplished to have no hair in my legs, arms and intimate areas... This is the best thing that could ever happened to me!! YouGotta be careful with the intensity of the light though, I totally recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> It worked well for me. Yes, it&#x27;s very time consuming but it WORKS if you commit to it. It&#x27;s been close to a year and my legs are still 90% hair free. It worked much better on my bikini line since the hair is darker and coarser. I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t have much faith it this but am extremely happy with the results. Will continue to use until I&#x27;m 99.9% hair free.  **Update** Almost 2 years later, I&#x27;m still hair free.</li>
    <li> did my underarms bikinni area an was working on legs got one done an almost over half the other an the bulb went poof damn thought it said 3 body treatments but all i get is that wow as of how it works donno yet to soon to know i guess now i cant even do the second one till i get more replacement bulbs damn didnt even get finished with the first one</li>
    <li> Update 3/3/2012: I&#x27;m pleased to report I&#x27;ve had *totally* different results on my bikini line than on my legs. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;ve seen at least a 60% reduction in growth after 3 treatments, maybe more (I&#x27;m only 1 week post-treatment so there is still time for more hairs to fall out) - I&#x27;m amazed and completely pleased! Still working on my legs, making progress slowly but surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - I think the color and texture of the hairs do make a HUGE difference in the results - not just between different people, but between different parts of your own body. Accordingly, I&#x27;m sure the reviews here and people&#x27;s experiences will vary a lot. But it does work!!&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/8/2012: So, after a bunch of treatments (6?) I&#x27;m back to update. You are probably wondering how I fit so many treatments in in the ~7 weeks or so since my last update - I&#x27;ll get to that.&lt;br /&gt;The results: I *do* still have hair on my legs (the only place I&#x27;ve treated so far). HOWEVER: it is much more sparse and thin than it was before. I&#x27;m disappointed I wasn&#x27;t TOTALLY! HAIRLESS! after 3 sessions as the advertisement promised, but I do think it&#x27;s *working* and will continue to treat. The reason I&#x27;m not downgrading my rating to fewer stars (yet) is because:&lt;br /&gt;1) For my first 3 treatments I was so excited about the device, I only waited 1 week between treatments. I read in the comment section here that professional IPL actually recommends you wait up to 4 weeks between treatments (!) because it takes 10-15 days just for the hairs to fall out. If they haven&#x27;t fallen out, they haven&#x27;t re-grown, so you&#x27;re treating the same hairs over and over if it you do it too frequently. As soon as I read that, I switched to every 2 weeks like they recommend. My bad for not following directions initially and I do think this has affected my results.&lt;br /&gt;2) My leg from knee to ankle is a *lot* of surface area; at least more so than places like tummyor underarms. I am pretty sure I have not yet mastered the art of not missing spots when I&#x27;m treating (most of my thicker remaining hair is centered on my shinbone for some reason - maybe I keep missing there?) so perhaps every hair has not been treated every time. My sister-in-law has this device as well and said it&#x27;s working miracles for her everywhere but not as much on her legs. So that&#x27;s a theory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now working on bikini area and am going to keep treating my legs. I expect to see a significant reduction very very soon. If not, I&#x27;ll be back to report. (This review will get impossibly long!)&lt;br /&gt;____________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/12/2011: My second treatment was this weekend and I can definitively say I have fewer hairs growing back today than I would normally. I last shaved on Thursday (today is Monday) and usually my legs would already be covered in noticeable stubble, so I think it&#x27;s actually working. I&#x27;d post pictures here if I could! I have small patches of leg that have no hair, and the hairy patches (ick) are less.. thick.. dense?.. than they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to know that is difficult about the device is the window is smaller than the treatment head, so it&#x27;s hard to see what patches are overlapping and which aren&#x27;t. I imagine this will make for initially patchy results, but it&#x27;s easy to go back and spot treat. More updates to come.&lt;br /&gt;__________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I certainly hope the hair removal industry is ready, because they are going DOWN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super excited to be an early-adopter of one of these devices because now I get to be totally hairless before all of my friends. Well, at least that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping. Full disclosure is that I just bought my i-light last week so have only done one treatment so far (second one scheduled for a few days from now), so I plan to review it today and then update again once I&#x27;ve done the full 3 treatments they recommend before seeing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the machine. It&#x27;s easy to use (after reading the instruction booklet, of course) and I&#x27;m pretty confident it will work (when I zapped areas of my leg that I missed while shaving, I actually saw the little hairs shriveling up). It IS important, as they say, to shave beforehand because a) it hurts less and b) no burnt hair smell. I was able to use power level 5 so hopefully after treatment #2 I&#x27;ll start seeing fewer hairs.</li>
    <li> I received the package today and just had my first treatment. I basically paid the same price as what I used to pay for my laser treatments in the laser center. I can say it was much better than what I was expecting. the highest energy level is not as high as the level the physician in the laser treatment center used to set for me, and I feel its only half of the energy level of the laser machine in the center. Nevertheless, I believe having everyday access to my IPL6000 at home, and using it every two weeks, it ends up giving much better results as compared to what I used to get from my treatments in the laser center. I will update within two weeks</li>
    <li> The item is easy to use.  I am not really hairy (but light skin, dark hair) and I tried once a salon IL treatment. It was stronger there and hair left in a week or so, almost all that was treated (but it grew back fast as well).  After this one, it takes about two weeks, in my case, for hair to leave but it does leave.  After two weeks I have -- underarms about half hair gone, bikini area maybe just 20%. I think after third lower legs and underarm may be hairless (but probably totally hairless after 4-5 times), bikini will take definitely more than 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you posted after completing the full three treatment procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am back now after few months.... So, after having used one lamp, I don&#x27;t think it is such a great device. It may temporarily reduce hair growth if you apply it regularly but lamps end fast in my opinion and to be honest waxing and epilating is much easier and cheaper.  At least for those who are not totally hairy.  It removes about 30, max 50% of hair until you stop using it, so you have to use it permanently and you cannot use it in summers....  I am not hairy person -- I never shave my hands or upper legs and hair is not noticible there.</li>
    <li> This review is from the husband.  The very best thing about this device is when she lets me run it.  You know, on her.  It is rather a science fiction type of device and you almost cannot believe it will work at zapping hair, yet it is so much fun to use that, at first, it just doesn&#x27;t matter if it does or not.  Then after a few weeks go by and she begins to become an alabaster sculpture.  Now I chose that analogy (metaphor?) correctly since you do not want to buy one of these if you are dark complected as it will cook you.  Also, the smooth alabaster surface is just how she feels to the touch.  It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not keep track at how long we took before the initial lamp bulb expired, but I was not shocked when it died.  The replacements are available on ebay and worth it for the effect this thing achieves.  It has not eliminated all hair, but it has greatly reduced the texture of stiffness, or columnar strength of the hair, makes it grow much more slowly and sparsely and what does appear is lighter in shade.  In fact we have used it less and less, and I think with more disciplined use, it would make her almost hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a cooling fan and is a bit noisy, about that of a nice quality electric shaver.  The zapping itself is akin to a stretched rubber band snap and depending on how much you dial up the zapper and how sensitive you are varies in its intensity from mild to ZAP.  Take it slow and keep after it and you will be pleased at the result.  With the cost of good razor blades, this item may come closer to paying for itself than one might think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One draw back is that the sessions take a while as you have to cover ground slowly as the zapper only covers so much skin per zap.  I think this Remington zaps as much surface area if not more than the Tria, et al, but it still takes a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice that it does have a cord.  It produces not a laser pulse of light, but a very high intensity flash.  You will need to look to the side if you are running it on someone, or perhaps consider some light sunglasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, again, make the zapping session a team effort and it turns into one of those little games for the couple of intrigue.</li>
    <li> This is the best item I bought. I used to wax my legs and get lots of ingrown hair, since I started to use ILp, my hair growth decreased 85% and no ingrown hair. I just ordered my second cartridge, it is way worth than going to a laser treatment. ...love it</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Saturday March 16th, 2013 TWELFTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 121 + 1304 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 1425&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*ORIGINAL* FLASH CARTRIDGE FINALLY DIED BUT!.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could have gone longer. There is definitely a counter in the unit that does not go beyond 1500 flashes and seeing as how I&#x27;m within 75 flashes, that seems par for the course considering there were times I lost count (from the pain at times lol) and tried to pick up where I *thought* I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked the bulb after the last session and aside from looking a little worn it seemed quite intact in every way. There were no cracks or signs of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you think about it Remington probably tested the cartridge to its breaking point and let&#x27;s say that after a few tests in a controlled environment, they realized that the bulb cracked or even exploded at say, 1800 pulses. As a result of the bulb cracking or exploding the unit itself was damaged. Maybe it melted a fan blade or messed up the electronics permanently. This may be what led to the unit using a counter to make sure that at a safe number like 1500, the unit would render the cartridge useless. So as much as Remington is making money off replacement cartridges, they are also providing an effective fail-safe to ensure that the unit isn&#x27;t damaged and the user is satisfied to a degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the fact that the cartridge could have lasted longer but I&#x27;ve seen how light bulbs can burn out, pop and explode and when I think of that happening next to some sensitive parts of my body???? I&#x27;d rather just pay for another cartridge. I&#x27;ll keep reviewing the replacement cartridges on their product page but as for this product, yes, you guessed it. FIVE STARS!!!!  *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Tuesday March 12th, 2013 ELEVENTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 75 + 1229 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 1304&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A FEW TOUCH UPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did some additional light touch ups around my bikini line and waist above my navel and I just noticed that the bulb life indicator is now YELLOW (It has been GREEN up until now).... This is telling me that I&#x27;m extremely close to the bulbs death, FINALLY. Still though, the unit is still flashing on the original bulb and I&#x27;ll let you all know at what number it finally dies. Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in intensity between the original bulb and a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Thursday March 7th, 2013 TENTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 310 + 919 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 1229&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOING FOR BROKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so now I&#x27;m starting to wonder if this flash bulb will ever die. I showered and shaved the entire area but this time I went a little further past the bikini line hence the lengthy session. No lotions or moisturizers were applied to the area prior to treatment. I flashed every part of my crotchal region from front to back, paused a minute or two every now and then to let the bulb cool and wiped the lens in between flashes. After treatment, I left the unit on so the fan would cool the bulb until it reset and then activated it again and left the fan to run a second time until reset. This way I know everything has cooled down before I put it back in the box. I have to say I&#x27;m starting to love the feel of it all and my wife loves it too  :). So now, after all these treatments I can now go a day or two without feeling the need to shave and at this point I can probably go a few more days but the OCD in me keeps making me shave lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are now at 1169 flashes on the original bulb so I don&#x27;t see any reason to dock any stars on my review....  I am MUCH MUCH smoother than before and I can now shaveagainst the grain of hair without a single ugly red ingrown hair showing up. THE ONLY THING THAT I FIND ANNOYING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IS; the button is very elusive when you are bending and twisting your wrist to get at those hard to reach spots. The fix for this is simple. Put a little nub on the center of the button so when your flashing and you can&#x27;t see the button, you can feel for the center and press it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Thursday Feb 28th, 2013 NINTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 184 + 735 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 919&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same prep for session as last time and same routine. I shaved, dried the area thoroughly, DID NOT APPLY ANY CREAMS OR LOTIONS TO THE AREA, flashed every part of my crotchal region from front to back, paused a minute or two every now and then to let the bulb cool and wiped the lens in between flashes. This unit is still running strong on the original flash cartridge at 919 flashes and that&#x27;s after over 2 months of weekly use! Now you should all know that I am breaking some of the rulese here. I&#x27;m using this device every 7 to 10 days as opposed to the recommended 2 week wait. I&#x27;m also doing FULL sessions every session instead of \\&quot;touch ups\\&quot; like the instructions recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m about 80 percent hairless in the crotch front to back with the regrowth being a little thinner. Whatever is growing back I&#x27;m assuming has lost a bit of the brown pigment that it used to have as I&#x27;m no longer in my 20&#x27;s (41).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this thing work???? YOU BET YOUR A$$ it does. You just have to be careful with it that&#x27;s all  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Saturday Feb 16th, 2013 EIGHTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 100 + 635 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 735&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same prep for session as last time and same routine. I shaved, dried the area thoroughly, flashed every part of my crotchal region from front to back, paused a minute or two every now and then to let the bulb cool and wiped the lens in between flashes. One thing I am definitely noticing is that, as the sessions progress they are slowly getting shorter... I&#x27;m still doing every inch of my pubic area but I&#x27;m flashing a larger area as in, that after a flash I&#x27;m placing the gun a little farther away from the last area flashed. It&#x27;s not because I&#x27;m trying to be frugal with the bulb or anything, it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m seeing less and less hair and it&#x27;s getting harder to tell where there is and isn&#x27;t hair which is a great sign that the product is working. Another thing I&#x27;m noticing which I LOVE is NO MORE INGROWN HAIRS!!!!!! I&#x27;m now shaving against the grain in areas where shaving against would mean painful ingrown hairs and red spots. Amazing! No other product EVER, has been able to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after all the reviews on amazon saying that the cartridge does not last I honestly think its because of either factor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) The unit is not being used with care.&lt;br /&gt;B) It&#x27;s defective.&lt;br /&gt;C) The unit is not being maintained properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You HAVE TO:&lt;br /&gt;- Clean the lens after a few flashes&lt;br /&gt;- Take your time and resist flashing it like a paparazzi&lt;br /&gt;- Let the gun cool for 2 resets when your done.&lt;br /&gt;- Put it back in the original box when it has cooled properly to keep dust and dirt out of the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I&#x27;m doing and I made it past the 700 flash mark. Hopefully we&#x27;ll be able to go further.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars remain....... For now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Thursday Feb 7th, 2013 SEVENTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 124 + 511 from previous sessions. Total&#x3D; 635&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK. So nothing different from last time. I shaved, dried the area thoroughly, flashed every part of my crotchal region from front to back, paused a minute or two every now and then to let the bulb cool and wiped the lens in between flashes. The cartridge is still going strong and I&#x27;m confident that it will make it past the halfway mark. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results...Well I looked under my ball sack earlier today and I noticed that there was absolutely no trace of hair to be seen, not even black spots. The same goes for the bikini line. The area above my penis is hit and miss but I&#x27;m starting to see the bald patches growing in size so I&#x27;m sure that in time it will look like my bikini line. As for my ass crack, well, I really can&#x27;t see back there and I&#x27;m not gonna start using a mirror or anything but it does feel smoother even after I haven&#x27;t shaved for a full 24 hours. Usually it starts getting itchy after that much time has gone by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I believe this product does EXACTLY what Remington has stated it will do and nothing more. To me it&#x27;s obvious that they did test it extensively so that they could manage our expectations accurately. The only area where I can see improvement is in the false claim that it will last 1500 pulses as these results were no doubt, obtained under very strict controlled conditions so there should be some mention of this in the manual as well as a notice that not everyone will get the same life span out of the cartridge. Either way, to Remington I say bravo for making a great product. To me this is well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars remain....... For now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Monday Jan 28th, 2013 SIXTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 142 + 369 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 511&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well the bulb is still going strong andI&#x27;d like to hear form people who&#x27;s bulb did not make it past 500 flashes. To those people I&#x27;m pretty sure you are working the bulb too hard i.e. too many flashes per minute, not pausing enough in between flashes, not cleaning the lens and not letting the gun cool and \\&quot;automatically shut off\\&quot; or \\&quot;reset\\&quot; after your session. This is all I&#x27;m doing and so far it is keeping the bulb intact and functioning as it should. Another thing I&#x27;ve discovered is that the instructions tell you to shave the area and wipe the skin clean and completely dry the area... This is EXTREMELY important!!! If you shave then apply some sort of moisturizer to the skin, yes your skin is clean but the oils from the moisturizer will leave a residue on the leans during the sessions thereby making the gun retain more heat than it can bleed off, and if you&#x27;re not constantly cleaning the lens then don&#x27;t be surprised when the cartridge prematurely dies on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still doing the pubic area from front to back and still using my yoga skills to their limits lol..... As for results, I could not be happier. There seems to be more bald patches and in the areas where the hair is still growing back it is coming in thinner and finer. Great results after just 6 weeks of treatments.  the 5 stars REMAIN!.. For now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Thursday Jan 18th, 2013 FIFTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 127 + 242 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 369&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so I have officially been at this for an entire month and here is my verdict.... This product works AS PROMISED and I really do mean that. If you have a look in the manufacturers description it says that that it will \\&quot;deliver results that last 6 months\\&quot; and you&#x27;ll notice that right next to it is an asterisk.... Here is what this little asterisk means \\&quot;*Individual results will vary. In clinical testing, on average, participants had 47.8 percent fewer hairs six months after just three treatments, similar to results observed from professional hair removal systems.\\&quot; AND THEY ARE RIGHT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past month and after 5 full treatments I am noticing around 45 percent hair loss. will it last 6 months? I don&#x27;t really think so but that varies from one person to another. Furthermore, I did not use it as directed. Near the end I was using it once a week instead of the recommended 2 weeks. Also, they have been full treatments and not the recommended touch ups after the first three treatments. All in all, I am still NOT disappointed with the I-light Pro. It promises reduced hair growth and I got that. It promises slower regrowth and I got that too. It promised 1500 flashes on the light cartridge and mine is still going strong so I can&#x27;t really comment on it yet but we will see. Would I buy this item again? YES. Should you? Yes IF you have the right skin/hair combination but again, DON&#x27;T EXPECT MIRACLES. Expect it to help you in your hair removal process and keep you from spending stupid insane amounts of money going to laser clinics and spas to have something done for you that you can do for yourself for MUCH LESS MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would I have liked the I-light Pro to give better results? Of course but hey, I read all the reviews and I know what I bought into. Furthermore, I don;t have the Ideal Skin, hair combination. Yes I am fair skinned and yes I have dark brown/black hair but I do have some grey hair starting to pop up here and there so I can;t really expect it to work as promised... And since long term results literally take YEARS to achieve, I&#x27;ll keep at it. To be honest it&#x27;s kind of fun to use  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep updating this review until I have to switch the light cartridge but so far, so good......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Thursday Jan 10th, 2013 FOURTH SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 74 + 168 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 242&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEED TO TAKE CONTORTION LESSONS TO GET BACK THERE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must be addicted to this product because I just did a full treatment AGAIN! The only reason I did it is because I&#x27;m really noticing a difference in the rate of hair growth and the regrowth. Also, there was another review here where the reviewer was using it every few days and she was getting amazing results so why not try it right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around I did front AND back and by back I mean I really had to reach down between my legs and spread areas that I never EVER though I&#x27;d be spreading. Since I am used to shaving my but crack and around my butt hole by feel in the shower, I did the same with the I-Light Pro. It was much harder than I thought. The thick \\&quot;cable\\&quot; made it hard to get the head into the right position to zap so if there is one thing I&#x27;d recommend to Remington, it&#x27;s to make it all just a wee bit more versatile in this sense WITHOUT making it cordless. Either way, the job got done regardless of all the bending, twisting and spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual, I checked the lens every second or third flash to make sure that it stayed clean. If there was any dust or dirt, I quickly cleaned the lens to make sure everything was running smooth. So far this little sucker is going strong with 242 flashes under it&#x27;s belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still impressed, still 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUICK UPDATE: Wednesday Jan 9, 2013  OBSERVATIONS (no session performed)&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 0 + 168 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 168&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 3 days since my last session and here is what I am noticing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Reduced hair growth and *delayed* hair growth int he area I have been treating (bikini line, ball sack, perineum, area around anus pubic hair all around penis.&lt;br /&gt;- Bald patches in some areas as in NO TRACE OF HAIR  :)&lt;br /&gt;- Hair growing in thinner and sparser.&lt;br /&gt;- No redness or irritated skin like you&#x27;d get epilating.&lt;br /&gt;- No indication of Bulb \\&quot;konking out\\&quot; and on that note, read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will ding Remington for making such a false claim that the bulb will last 1500 flashes BUT, you all have to know that when they tested the bulb life, they wanted to get the most flashes so how did they achieve this? Here&#x27;s how:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- They used it on the lowest setting&lt;br /&gt;- They allowed the flash cartridge to properly cool between flashes (as in, not flash constantly for minutes on end like some people who are in a rush may do)&lt;br /&gt;- They tested it in a properly ventilated room to prevent premature overheating.&lt;br /&gt;- They tested it under PERFECTLY CLEAN AND DUST FREE CONDITIONS.&lt;br /&gt;- The flash bulb test was NOT done while being used on someone&#x27;s skin hence the lens was never dirty during the test and which did not lead to added heat building up in the unit (The lens DOES get dirty very quickly even after 5 or 6 flashes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So doing it like this, I can see how Remington&#x27;s test facility got 1500 flashes out of the cartridge. Now then; Here is why I think the cartridges aren&#x27;t lasting 1500 flashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- People are using it on the highest setting all the time (obviously it&#x27;s gonna impact the life of the flash bulb no matter what people here will tell you)&lt;br /&gt;- People are using it in a poorly kept environment i.e. dusty room from pet dander, pet hair, smoking (dust accumulates on the lens and bulb itself and negatively impact its lifespan)&lt;br /&gt;- People are using it in a hot/humid room&lt;br /&gt;- People are NOT keeping the lens clean during treatment sessions and in between flashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So folks, when you use it, make time for the session so that you&#x27;re not in a rush. Do the treatment in a clean, cool and dust free environment. Give the device time to cool properly in between flashes (thisties back to the whole *take your time* thing), keep the lens clean during your sessions and in between flashes and don&#x27;t use it immediately after a shower/bath in your bathroom (heat).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Sunday Jan 6, 2013  THIRD SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 60 + 108 from previous sessions. Total &#x3D; 168&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOING FOR THE BURN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK so it&#x27;s only been 4 days since the last session and not 2 weeks like the instructions recommend. WHY? Well, I was talking to my wife about the treatments and mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t really smelling any burnt hair to which she replied, \\&quot;Then it may not be working... Are you using it on it&#x27;s highest setting?\\&quot; to which I replied, \\&quot;No, I&#x27;m using it on level 4 which is one notch down from the highest, level 5\\&quot;. So she said, \\&quot;Do it again on the highest setting. You should be smelling burnt hair.\\&quot; therefore, I&#x27;m considering this treatment more of a touch up than a session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I have to say that I&#x27;m seeing results even before the third treatment. I&#x27;m starting to see actual BALD SPOTS which is encouraging considering that I have only done 2 sessions. The third went just as well as the second. In terms of pain, there isn&#x27;t much of a difference between level 4 and 5 but I did smell a bit more burnt hair which was the overall goal. I later treated the area with some Aloe Vera but so far, my skin is reacting quite well. There&#x27;s no blistering or crazy redness. Had I tried epilating in the same spot, it would have hurt like hell and created tons of red spots and irritated the skin. I am really starting to like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now.... In between treatments, I&#x27;ve been researching other IPL products and found that they are all doing the same thing but instead of using the more common term \\&quot;IPL\\&quot; (Intense Pulse Light) some are using a new term called \\&quot;HPL\\&quot; or \\&quot;Home PulseLight\\&quot;... Don&#x27;t let this new term fool you, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE. Also, in my research I was looking at the Silk&#x27;n SN-008 Flash&amp;Go which sells here on Amazon for 299.00.... Overall the device does EXACTLY the same thing that the I-Light Pro does but with a few unnecessary extras. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an inferior product but I do think that it&#x27;s no better than the I-Light Pro. I also came across a YouTube video about the Silk&#x27;n SN-008 Flash&amp;Go and the video specifically states that \\&quot;due to the nature of the hair growth cycle, achieving long term results may require multiple treatment sessions over a period of 18-24 months\\&quot;. They mention it at 07:27 in this video [...]  Taking this into consideration, you can expect the same thing with the I-light Pro....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after 14 days and only 2 sessions I&#x27;m seeing good results therefore the review will remain at 5 stars. More to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Jan 2nd, 2013  SECOND SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Flashes used this session &#x3D; 68 + 40 from last session. Total &#x3D; 108&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I decided to wait the full 2 weeks like the instructions recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the prep. I shaved my groin area and dried it thoroughly. Then flashed the area from the perineum (gap between your butthole and your vagina/ball sack) to my navel and it wasn&#x27;t that bad this time around. The one thing I did that made a difference is; anytime the flashes started to hurt even a bit, I&#x27;d flash, wait until the pain from the last flash would subside (about 20 seconds) then flash the next section. It really did make it more comfortable for me. I&#x27;m not noticing any REAL hair loss yet as it is only my second session and there are many IPL pros here who say it takes many months before seeing NOTICEABLE results, so for now the review remains at 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***QUICK TIP TO ENSURE PROPER BULB LIFE: Try to remember to wipethe lens thoroughly BETWEEN flashes. This keeps the lens clean and thereby makes the treatment more effective not to mention allows more of the light to pass THROUGH the lens so that the heat from the flash doesn&#x27;t get bounced back into the cartridge adding to the heat build up. Also, once you are done DO NOT TURN OFF THE UNIT!!!! Let the fan run until the unit shuts itself off and you hear a beep, then feel the exhausted air coming out of the base and make sure it is COOL before turning the unit off. There, you&#x27;ve just eliminated another variable that MAY kill the flash bulb sooner. More to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY ZAPPING  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, to bide my time I&#x27;ve been reading reviews from other similar products but one product that REALLY caught my attention was the NO-NO... As in \\&quot;NO-NO the freikin thing broke down again!!!\\&quot; Lol. This ridiculous POS sells for as high as 350.00 and is nowhere near as reliable or as effective as the I-light pro. While the I-light Pro sells for as little as 180 (with coupon if you&#x27;re lucky enough to find one). I pity those who regretfully gave the NO-NO a chance. Now their money is NO-NOwhere to be found. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday December 23rd, 2012  FIRST SESSION&lt;br /&gt;Setting : 1-3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, let me just say that I&#x27;m in my early forties and starting to get gray hair on my head and I&#x27;m not expecting miracles like some other reviewers. I read all the reviews and all I expect this product to do is prevent hair from growing back so quickly that I need to shave every day. I am a guy and I HATE hair. It&#x27;s ugly and having been a cyclist for so long, I learned to shave EVERYTHING, from front to back and legs as well. I love the feeling and so does my wife. what I don&#x27;t like is all the prep work and process to be hairless. Also, when biking, the grinding of the legs really makes it hard on my thighs and crotch so Ineed to be hairless down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, on with my review. I bought the Remington I-light PRO from Amazon and picked it up a few days ago. As soon as I got it home I opened it and began reading the instructions. Much to my delight Remington seems to manage customer expectations VERY WELL. The instructions DO mention that the unit will not work as expected when used on dark skin and white/gray or blonde hair. Also it mentions that it is dangerous to use if you have dark skin so I really don&#x27;t understand why people are giving it one star ratings when they didn&#x27;t either follow the instructions or have the right combination of skin/hair. The instructions also recommend cleaning the lens and unit before putting it away after every session. Now, to be completely fair, the instructions DON&#x27;T tell you to leave the unit on after use so that the fan can cool the bulb which I&#x27;m guessing is leading to so many light cartridges not getting anywhere near 1500 flashes Which I can live with... Hell the bulbs are 20 dollars EACH and when compared to a professional laser hair removal session which I&#x27;m hearing can cost upwards of 200 EACH SESSION, the I light PRO really isn&#x27;t that costly,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used it on my crotch area and it does seem to work. Shaving prior to treatment is key as this product is designed to work below the skin BUT BE ADVISED, shave IN THE DIRECTION OF HAIRS AND NOT AGAINST!!! shaving against will get you a closer shave yes, but you&#x27;ll have to deal with ingrown hairs no matter how much exfoliating and moistirizing you do. Shave your legs anyway you want but for the bikini line and crotch area and for the purpose of preparing the skin for THIS type of treatment and future treatments, the last thing you want is red bumps and ingrowns. The flashes not only kill the hair but also burn the extra hair right off and like many reviewers said, it does feel like a rubber band being snapped on your skin. I tried it on level 4 and found that the pain was quite manageable but I have yet to try it on level 5. Once it was over I had treated my groin area making sure not to overlap flashes and it left my skin feeling rough because the burnt hair is still there but we&#x27;ll see what happens in the next few days. I&#x27;m gonna try using it once a week depending on whether or not there will be red bumps, itchiness or irritated skin. If there is any of this, I&#x27;ll use it every 2 weeks as per the instructions. Let&#x27;s see how it goes. More to come in my update  :)&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Total flashes used so far &#x3D; 40</li>
    <li> I have had my Remington ipl for almost a year now so I figure this is a good time to give an experienced review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start by saying that if you are going to buy this product you need to be realistic about the results you are going to get. Don&#x27;t forget that this is an AT HOME laser so you will not get the same results you would in the salon.  With that being said, this laser works well.  I have tan skin and very dark hair on my body, I&#x27;ve used the product on my lower legs, underarms and bikini so far.  In the beginning I used the laser faithfully every three weeks.  Within 4 treatments I noticed significantly less hair on the treated areas.  Within 3 months I&#x27;d say 50% less on my legs, 50% less under my arms and about 80% less on the bikini line.  I was pleasantly surprised with the bikini line results because that was the area I wanted to treat the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately I&#x27;ve been using my laser a lot less, maybe once a month.  Mainly because I just got lazy with it, and it can be painful (it feels like a hot rubber band snap).  The darker and thicker the hair, the more you will feel it.  As summer draws closer I plan on using my laser more frequently. I would like to do my thighs next.  The bottom line is, this laser has already payed for itself.  Like I said you will not get professional results but if you have the right hair, you WILL see a decrease in hair.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my chest for about 4 months now. It is quite easy to use, and after the first or second time, the small \\&quot;tinge\\&quot; you get with each flash becomes tolerable at the highest setting (5). It does not take long to do my entire chest, maybe 5-10 minutes at most. I have been using this every two weeks for the first 3 months as was suggested by the directions. this pas tmonth I have used it every week, to see if it would increase the results. So far, this has removed about 50-60% of the hair on my chest, and the remainder hair grows in slower. It used to have to shave it at least once every 6-7 days. Now, it takes about 2 weeks for the hair to grow the same length it would previously in 6-7 days. I am white, and have fair skin in the winter, and tan easily in the summer. I have not had any issues with this product due to skin color or tan. Although, I must mention, that in order to \\&quot;unlock\\&quot; the product (each time u turn it on), you must put the sensor close to your skin so it can detect and make sure your skin is the correct color. Sometimes, it seems this sensor device does a poor job of detecting my skin. As it will take 5-6 times or more sometimes, for it to give me the green light to continue. Other times i have no issues on the first detection. I have tried this with all areas of by body, thinking maybe it was a tan that was throwing it off, however, even when letting it detect skin in areas that never get sunlight, it still has an issue sometimes with detecting my skin color and unlocking. I know other reviewers have complained about having to buy new bulbs. For just my chest, it may take 20 or so flashes to complete. And the bulbs have a life of 1000+ flashes (if i remember correctly), and doing this once a week, well you can do the math, it should last a long time for my use.</li>
    <li> Worth the price. Works like a charm</li>
    <li> Used it for about three months and never saw a strand of hair fall out. My hair is just as full as it was when I started. It felt like it was working, similarly to when I would get professional treatments, but I never saw the results.  Within the 3 months of using it, the bulb burnt out. The bulb burnt out about a week in. I was reimbursed with a second bulb, and I also purchased one on my own. After three months of no results I stopped using it. I picked it up today (7months later) to use it and everything worked but the bulb flash. So, I figure \\&quot;it&#x27;s been a while I&#x27;ll just put in my spare bulb.\\&quot; The spare bulb did not work either, which in turn leads me to believe this machine has already begun to malfunction. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Just *sigh :-( I bought this one for my gf. bc she have had so much stress&#x27;full of her unwanted body hair so I bought this product for her birthday surprise she loved this product in very first time but very soon later me and she got huge disappointed with skin burn and skin damages by this product so had return it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so much expect that wanna make my gf full of happiness but I was wrong :-( she went to dermatologist bc recovering of her skin damages and skin burn</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really liking this product! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s challenging to hold the handset and move it for appropriate spacing of treatments in a way that allows you to push the button. I&#x27;m seeing good results! I was actually surprised it&#x27;s working as well as it is because I have a hard time following the schedule exactly and I also struggle with the patience to get the treatment sections perfectly spaced with no overlap and no gaps. Because I&#x27;ve been a little haphazard in my approach (though generally following the instructions), I found that I have to go back and treat small patched that I obviously missed along the way, but I have no complaints about that. At this point, the bikini areas I&#x27;ve treated are perfectly hairless, and my underarms are probably 80% hairless because I have trouble with the placement and am going back over them. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on large areas like legs... the treatment window is just too small! Overall, a great product for the price. Way cheaper and more convenient than paying for professional treatments, plus I get to keep the device for touch-ups. I&#x27;ve even lent it to a good friend who is also having great results.</li>
    <li> It hurts. It works.&lt;br /&gt;Will take time &amp; patience to get them all. but the first few more painful sessions definitely get more results.</li>
    <li> This product did not perform as intended for me.  I have dark, coarse hair.  I used this on my bikini area and underarms.  I used this product for about 6 months following the instructions in the booklet.  At no point did the hair seem to stop growing or thin out.  In fact, it made the skin, particularly my underarms sensitive.  I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal that worked and the cost of this equipment could have paid for most of the cost for treatment in the areas mentioned above.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you are contemplating this machine, my suggestion would be just buy it as soon as possible. I have struggled with chin hair my entire life. I know we are not suppose to use it on our chins, I use goggles. I have seen dramatic results in 3 weeks. I have also been using it on my underarms as well. I don&#x27;t intend to use it on my legs yet. Don&#x27;t go on plucking and shaving... this is an amazing product. I am 50 years old. I wish I had bought it so much sooner. I bought the machine, goggles and an extra refill. Amazon had a sale one day while I was on. You will not regret your purchase.</li>
    <li> Used this for a few treatments. The wife used it on her legs, underarm and the usual places, I used it on my shoulders. The original light gave out about the time it should have. We ordered a second bulb and that bulb did not last as long. The problem may have been with the wand. It has a cooling fan that cools the bulb and the wand on our unit began to malfunction. There seems to be a broken wire or a loose solider connection. This is troubling because there was NEVER any stress put on the cord by pulling or kinking. It was always stored with the cord wrapped (as it is pictured), never dropped. I have not heard of anyone else having this issue, so maybe we just got the bad unit. Still, for the price we paid I would expect it to last longer than it has. We purchased this about a year ago, it malfunctioned about 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The IPL does work to remove hair, ours is just no longer functioning.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve already had some laser hair removal done and was excited to get this machine for my arms and other spots that needed cleaning up. This machine hurts far less than laser hair removal typically, but if your hair is dark and dense (underarms/bikini) it will hurt and it will take longer to do. But it really hurts no more than a regular laser hair removal treatment from a professional. However, the area I was surprised it worked the best on is my arms. And it was virtually painless (mostly just hot). I think it works best on finer, darker hair like the arms and parts of the leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed some people complain that the light cartridge goes out sooner than advertised. I noticed that the cartridge goes out quicker on the higher heat setting, so if you are at 1 the whole time it will probably last as long as advertised. If you are at 5 about half the time. Also, the strength of the zaps decrease toward the end... so if you are doing a tougher area I would change the cartridge as soon as that light changes and not wait for it to go out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wanted people to know that I have some freckles on my arms. Enough that there is no real avoiding them when I did them. It was fine. I noticed nothing bad from it.</li>
    <li> Jeg bestilte reminton 6000 efter grundigt at have undersøgt nettet om denne type hårfjerner. Og samme dag jeg modtog min reminton satte jeg den optimistisk til at fjerne hår under armene. Men men, den blinkede/virkede 2 gange og derefter lyste den gult som var indikator for at nu skulle der isættes nyt pulshoved. Jeg betalte ca 2000 kr. for den ved at købe den på amazon.de, på den danske side hvor man kan købe produktet er prisen 3200 kr. Jeg kontaktede Remington i Danmark som intet havde at tilføje - de sagde blot at så måtte jeg kontakte sælgeren. Elendigt og skuffende. Det er iøvrigt sket før for andre at ipl 6000 ikke virker når den startes op for første gang. Vil bare sige køb den ikke. det er virkelig skuffende og besværligt at skulle sende tilbage - prisen for returneringen er omkring 200 kr.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this it do not work more than 2 flashes. I hate it. waist of money and work</li>
    <li> I had thick dark coarse hair!  And now I have nofacial hair, no arm hair and very thin light colord hair on my legs.  Use it every 2 weeks for about 3 months to see results.  I have had it for 2 years for my legs.  I only purchased 2 cartridges in 2 years.  I only wish I had this when I was young .</li>
    <li> I am a Hispanic woman, dark hair and light skin. I have used this product for a month and a half on my legs and arm pits and I am happy to share my results. IT WORKS. I used it on the high settings and once a week instead of every two weeks, as recommended, by now I only have very scarce hair grown particularly on small spots where I have missed zapping. I can go now about 5 days or more without shaving and what I shave is really just the small patches I have missed like I said before. otherwise skin is smooth all the time! I have recommended this products and the people that used it are achieving same results :D</li>
    <li> Since, I bought and sent it to my daughter abroad, she complained that it is not working. I believe it is not efficient at all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the way I was expecting. The problem is that can get a little more expensive than expected, because after 1500 Pleated you need to buy another cartridge.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to remove male facial hair permanently.  The high intensity setting was a bit painful so I used ice to numb the area before flashing.  This allowed me to use maximum intensity.  The best thing about the I-Light was the larger area covered by each charge.  I had a Tria, but the coverage area was so small that it took much longer, meaning I had to use more flashes to get the same coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are still lighter hairs, which neither laser nor the IPL would remove, but there is almost no regrowth of darker hairs and what does come in (small amounts every 6-8 weeks) are easily removed with just a few flashes.</li>
    <li> OK this is the second time I am writing this. First one got erased. To the point. I started out with hopes and my hopes are higher.I am a 34 yo Male with light skin and very dark very thick hair ALL OVER. I read and watched tons of reviews. most of your low ratings were from people with light thin hair. high reviews from people with dark coarse hair. so seemed perfect for me. I still can&#x27;t believe people are rating it low cause they can&#x27;t use it on their face...... almost every review you read tells you it&#x27;s not for your face... how can this shock you. ok so if you read this keep in mind they say not to use it on your face. don&#x27;t go get this thing for your face then give it a low rating cause you can&#x27;t...... I think I still might. I used the machine on high setting first time. I bought 2 additional cartridges at the same time as the machine. I did my whole chest feet underarms and well one hand and cartridge is still good. I used it for 5-10 mins at a time then let it cool. First thing I noticed was the cord to the handheld. I read a review about how the cord came straight out and would kink over and how it was such a design flaw..... remington fixed it so it comes out with the flow of how you wrap it around the machine. This tells me that remington reads the reviews and is trying to better their product. thank you remington.&lt;br /&gt;-step one shaved neck down.&lt;br /&gt;-step two used I-Light PRO from lower abdomen up and decided to stop just at the top of my pecs so I could watch and see if there was a difference.&lt;br /&gt;-step 3 noticed that the razor bumps where I used the I-Light PRO were minimal and where I didn&#x27;t use it were nasty.&lt;br /&gt;-observation. the I-Light pro did something. maybe not kill all the hair but it sure did something.&lt;br /&gt;-step 4 shaved my fingers. treated one hand but not the other. Still waiting to see if there is a difference.&lt;br /&gt;-step 5 zapped my neck at the bottom of my facial hair just because I wanted to see what it would do. it hurt a lot even with the power at 3 but I managed.&lt;br /&gt;-step 6 shaved both armpits and zapped one.&lt;br /&gt;- observation. nothing yet it&#x27;s only been maybe 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;-step 7 shaved my back which wasn&#x27;t terrible but I hate body hair like I have.&lt;br /&gt;-step 8 zapped back hair with assistance.&lt;br /&gt;-step 9 shaved and zapped my feet and toes.&lt;br /&gt;-step 10 got bored and took tweezers and lightly pulled on the hair on my stomach and chest. I&#x27;m impatient yes. ok so the hair is already 1/16 to 1/8 inch long. my hair grows fast and thick. there are very small patches where nothing has grown back yet not many and not big patches but there are some. so I started lightly tugging at the hair growing out. At first I was a little discouraged however as I was pulling the light hit the tweezers just right and I saw a hair stuck to them that I didn&#x27;t even know I pulled out. So I kept going and checking the tweezers more frequently. maybe one in every 20 hairs pulled out with no resistance at all they were growing but nothing was holding them in skin didn&#x27;t move at all the hair pulled out very easy. should I do this I don&#x27;t know. Maybe not. but I did it and it makes me at least think that this machine is working at least a little. I can for sure notice some change and look forward to seeing in a couple weeks what the change is. While in Korea I dated a girl who used a intense pulse light hair remover that worked the same way. I didn&#x27;t know she used it and one day I saw a hair under her arm and was going to pull it. she told me no that she would go home shave it off and use her laser on it. I didn&#x27;t know what these systems were but she explained it to me the best she could and told me she hasn&#x27;t shaved in over a year and has only had maybe 6 hairs pop up in that time. She said every time they do she cuts off the hair and zaps it and after a short time the hair is gone. I truly believe that this system after a while will give me the same results. I noticed a change after the first use and I hope tokeep seeing changes. my hair is the same as everyone who has given this device a high rating. I do not belong to any company I was not given this device. I am not receiving anything for this review . I&#x27;m just a hairy guy that can&#x27;t stand hair. I want to save those people money who have similar hair as those who gave low reviews and encourage those of you who have dark coarse hair. Would I recommend this to a friend? old on wait a min because that is a loaded question. I would recommend it 1000% to someone who has the right skin and hair. I would not recommend it to anyone who does not however that is only based on the reviews I have read. and the observations I have made. I would even be willing to put my e-mail on here so if anyone wants pics or has questions they could ask but I don&#x27;t think I am allowed to so I won&#x27;t yes I know this is lengthy but I want everyone to be able to know what I know. I don&#x27;t want to give a half truth review. I hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Not sure where to start this review. I have been using this item since receiving it as a christmas gift (going on 3 months). I typically wax my legs and underarms. I was looking for something a little less painful, but something just as long lasting if not longer. So far this item makes me just want to go back to waxing. You have to shave before using the light, and shave in between treatments. The light is so small that it takes many shots of the light to cover an area. The light only has so many uses before you have to replace it. The directions state it will give you a warning when you are low. Mine did not. I had to rush to order a replacement bulb and shave while waiting for it to come in. I managed to treat part of one leg before it ran out. I will admit there was a small difference between where I just treated and where it hadn&#x27;t. I still don&#x27;t think I like this unit. Even in the areas treated there was a good amount of hair, and because you&#x27;re instructed to shave, those hairs are course and pokey. I plan on trying the new bulb out before giving it a complete thumbs down. For the price we paid I would have expected a slightly better outcome. I know salon treatments are a great deal more, but home waxing doesn&#x27;t cost that much. I may just revert back to my old methods</li>
    <li> I bought this item last year, after having professional hair removal on my face. I figured for the price of one professional session I could treat my whole body. Being a women that has PCOS, I&#x27;m pretty hairy. I noticed a difference in how fast my hair growth was after the first treatment. The treatment takes about 45 - 60 minutes to do legs, bikini, stomach, and underarm areas. Instead of needing to shave every other day, I went a week without having to shave after the first treatment.I do the treatment every other week(just like the instructions say to) I am now just finished with my fourth treatment(I&#x27;ve only worked up to level 3), and the hair growth that I do have is very patchy.I still shave once a week because of the patchy areas, but it takes much less time to shave now! I figure with a few more treatments, I&#x27;ll be hair free for the summer, and can just do touch ups occasionally. I am quite satisfied with this product,I am not embarrassed like I used to be with all the hair I had.I would have given it 5 stars, but the cartridges that you have to replace don&#x27;t last for 1500 flashes for me, I&#x27;ve used 3 cartridges for 4 treatments, but it&#x27;s still cheaper than going to the professionals to do it.</li>
    <li> So, lemme start out by saying that I&#x27;m a black, native american, and german mixed woman so my skin tone is very unique. It&#x27;s red toned on the tops of my arms, tan/olive-ish under the arms, and my legs can be kinda white during the winter (I&#x27;m a MESS sometimes I know lol) Anyway, I was worried about being able to use this product for fear that it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on since it has a tone tester to make sure that darker skinned people aren&#x27;t able to harm themselves by using the device.. but it did! Now, the only reason why I wanted this was to use it on my face (sides of the chin, upper lip, neck, jawline, never over the eyes) but it says clearly NOT to use it on your face.. but I did it anyway lol.. The first treatment it seemed like it had no effect at all and I was let down to be shaving or plucking hairs out the next day, 2 more treatments and my skin tone is evening out and doesnt have those dark spots from underlying hair roots (my hair is black so it was very obvious). I&#x27;m nearing 2 1/2 months of treatments and I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with it. If things continue going this way then I&#x27;m really positive that the whole 6 month apart treatments may be possible for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to compare this against going to a pro and having to pay those hefty fee&#x27;s I would still choose this primarily because it&#x27;s cost effective if you have black hair. I love my results so much that I wish I had taken before and after photographs to show women that are or are near ethnically like me that this device really does work.</li>
    <li> it really works!! the results are visible after the 2nd use, i love this product and it has a really good price compared to the prices you have to pay in the clinics</li>
    <li> It really works, it has made a huge difference.  I use it on my underarms once a week or so and it only takes a minute or two.  But if you want to use it on your legs prepare to set aside an extra hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be time consuming to do large areas and it can be difficult to do more detailed, delicate areas.  If you want to move faster or use a higher power, prepare to replace the bulbs more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s very worth it to be able to go away for a few days and not have to concern yourself with shaving or waxing.</li>
    <li> I am a guy. I use it for my chest hair. It hurts like hell even if I use level 1. I smell burn someitme.</li>
    <li> First I wold like to say my hair is a little lighter then recommended.  I have completed 5 sessions and I also needed to replace my lamp cartridge.  I am going on vacation next week and my hope is that I need not take a razor. I have seen a remarkable change in my legs with regards to hair growth.  My under arms are questionable however on the second test run I chose not to do the left side and there was quite a difference in how fast the hair grew and how much grew back.  The best part is that to wear my swimsuit I won&#x27;t have any bumps. Even if you find yourself needing to shave for some strays its now an easy quick and pain free job!  I would recommend this product, I am allowing my daughter to use it for the cost of bulbs.  It is worth the cost if you have others in your family that can use it as well.  After I purchased on amazon I saw this on ultra for 190 and on living social for 200.  I wish I had waited and looked around.  This item needs several reviews to get a realistic review. As for now its 4 stars..  Could turn to 5 or 3 after I see what happens next.  Waiting on the next 6 months...</li>
    <li> I have the perfect complexion, light skin dark hair for laser hair removal to work. I have been using this machine on and off for 10 months or so with no obvious results. I also saw it at Costco for less than Amazon, go figure. I wish it actually got rid of my hair but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong enough. Save your money and buy a groupon for laser hair removal at a dr&#x27;s office or med spa!</li>
    <li> Prior to using this product, I had owned a Tria.  The Tria worked - it reduced my hair growth by about 50%, but it was a real hassle to use (the treatment head is tiny and the darn thing kept burning out, although the company did replace it for me twice).  When it finally kicked the bucket after a year, I had pretty much given up on home hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was shopping at Costco and saw this device.  At my husband&#x27;s urging, I decided to give it a try.  I am VERY glad I listened to my husband (hope he isn&#x27;t reading this ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, just as other reviewers have mentioned, the cartridge does burn out way too soon.  I called customer service and they sent me 2 new cartridges right away (save your old cartridge, though, because they send you a pre-paid label to ship it back to them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done 2 full treatments on my legs and my underarm area.  I am almost in shock - the hair growth is down to almost nothing (in fact, I haven&#x27;t shaved in 2 weeks :-)  Now, keep in mind that the Tria had already done half the job - I imagine it would take more than 2 treatments for someone who is just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges are a little pricey (because they burn out too soon), but compared to professional laser hair removal, using this device is ALOT cheaper.  I think this product is fantastic and would buy it again in a heartbeat :-)</li>
    <li> Spend the little bit extra, and get the one that doesn&#x27;t need replacement heads. It gets way expensive. I haven&#x27;t really seen much difference in hair growth</li>
    <li> Well.....I shouldn&#x27;t have bought all the extra light cartridges because the machine broke almost immediately (3 weeks with infrequent use).  I put it away and forgot all about it. Shame. I should have returned it. Note: the hair grew back with a slight delay once I couldn&#x27;t use the machine anymore so results are not permanent.</li>
    <li> The flash light burned after 6 usages. My friend had the same problem.</li>
    <li> Broke the first time I tried placing a new cartridge in it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care if people like my review or not or if I get \\&quot;points for positive reviews.\\&quot; The truth is that I wish I could post ZERO stars! It&#x27;s the most useless piece of junk I&#x27;ve EVER purchased! It&#x27;s horrid. It does absolutely nothing at all. At over $200.00 you would expect SOME results, but no. Nothing. Zero. Zilch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the instructions are that you have to COMPLETELY cleanse and shave the area to be treated. Then ... it&#x27;s a slow process ... lifting and moving and waiting for beeps and confirmations. Finally ... if you haven&#x27;t completely shaven the area, you get this horrid, burnt hair smell! But if you have shaven the area, it burns the skin ... no matter what level you choose. When you wake up in the morning, your treated area (in my case the chin) is red. Have to use cover up to hide it, which irritated the skin further and caused inflammation. And I am NOT a sensitive skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s horrid. I don&#x27;t need to go on. It simply doesn&#x27;t work. Period. It&#x27;s useless. It&#x27;ll sit on your counter. Yuck. Gross. Stupid. Worthless. Expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and have seen no difference and I had settings as high as would go.  Awfully expensive tool to see no difference at all</li>
    <li> This one works very well. That being said, you have to do this for many weeks before it does work very well. Be patient. If you know anything about laser hair removal you already know this tidbit.&lt;br /&gt;The pain. So, there are some spots that do not hurt at all. Then there are more tender spots that make it feel like Satan&#x27;s mistress herself came up just to punish you. I have yet to make it past the 3rd setting. I am genuinely terrified. I used my husband as a guinea pig in the beginning. He literally ran from the bathroom screaming obscenities at me while my daughter and I laughed. So for those of you that say you have a high pain tolerance and 5 doesn&#x27;t hurt you are blatant liars. It hurts....plain and simple. Be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to decide between this and the Tria-get this one. You can just plug it and and get started. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper. And don&#x27;t even bother with the NoNo. It&#x27;s garbage.&lt;br /&gt;In the end I only wish I had a lifetime supply of the refill light cartridges because they do run out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> It does work but you gotta be patient.  I have been using it every two weeks for two and half months.  I still don&#x27;t have all the hair removed and I am light/thin hair.  Could really be frustrating for someone with a lot of hair to remove.</li>
    <li> We purchased this item at a high price.  Right out of the Box it did not work!  The lights all came on and blinked and made a sound every 1/2 second.  Looking at the manual, that issues stated the unit was defective?  Really, brand new?  We Americans are getting things made in China where there is no Quality Control, products made by slave or child labor under terrible working conditions and yes, a communist run Country...and one must ask why?  Corporate American is based on Greed.  Make this unit in China, sell it and just replace it if it doesn&#x27;t work.  The item probably costs them $15 to make and they sell if for over $200 and it doesn&#x27;t work?  No Quality at all, just a nice looking piece of Chinese junk and sold at a very high profit margin.  Please do not purchase this item, it has no quality and you are only supporting a Communist Country that we may one day be at war with.  Spend more money and get a quality item made in the USA by American Workers.</li>
    <li> I have one more treatment for the initial phase. From the first treatment, hair not only thinned, but also seemed to grow far slower than normal. I have used only the highest setting,with minimal discomfort. I did not shave with a razor, but only an electric shaver. If hair is too long, an unpleasant burnt hair smell emits. That is the only negative that I have experienced.  I am still using the original light pulse cartridge:  longer than average legs, bikini area, and forearms.</li>
    <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This does not permanently remove hair. But it doesn&#x27;t claim to. I have olive skin with very dark, coarse, curly hair. I only used it 4 times and saw such a dramatic reduction in hair growth that I stopped using it. That was a mistake. 3 months later the hair is back to normal. This is not an issue with the product but with the user. I started using it again and will have to make sure to actually keep up with the treatments. Once the hair growth is reduced I think the treatments will only be needed once a month to maintain results. The bulbs do not last quite as long as advertised, but they are relatively inexpensive so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> This does seem like a good unit however the cartridge that came with the unit only worked maybe 30-40 times and then quit...thankfully I purchased a replacement cartridge and we will see how long that one lasts!</li>
    <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I used the item last Monday, got about 50 pulses. Tuesday I wanted to work on another area, but machine wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;pulse&#x27; anymore! After the chirp sound, I press the button and nothing happens. Whereas yesterday, a red pulse would emit.   I&#x27;ve already emailed Remington on this matter yesterday. But for whatever explanation, the product is still disappointing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only just started using, and it&#x27;s like a blessing from above! already there are fewer hairs and those that are coming back seem so much thinner! love love love!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only on my 2nd application , but I will update this review again.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to get a good close shave prior to use.  The less hair the less heat from the light.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how well this works. The beeping sound is a bit annoying, especially when you have dogs and they get curious at the sound every time it indicates that it&#x27;s ready for the &#x27;zap&#x27;. So far I&#x27;ve refilled the cartilage once. I used it on my arms, legs, bikini, and underarms. It works best on bikini, underarms and a some areas on my legs. The key is that the hair needs to be dark. My arms, and certain parts on my legs are very light, so it didn&#x27;t work there. However, I currently don&#x27;t have any hair on my underarms which is amazing! I use it ~2 times a week and the results really are great. I only used it on the lowest setting. The hair on my bikini is very faint and less and less is coming back. It&#x27;s wonderful. The hardest part is keeping track of where you&#x27;ve used the laser on before. You have to shave the area and then use the laser. The best thing is to work in grid pattern. I laser the area, then wait an hour or so, run errands, whatever, and then I do it again. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but it&#x27;s cheaper than going for 1 session at any laser place. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this item on january 3rd. I have completed three sessions according instructions (one session every two weeks). THe areas I have treated are my underpits and my chest. My idea is remove some hair of my underpits and all on my chest (I have no much hair really). The first session I tried the lowest intensity of light, the second level 3 and the last level 5. The sensation is not so painful i thought. I feel that level 5 is good for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results:  I can see a reduction of hair growing in some areas of my underpits and my chest. For only three sessions I&#x27;m really impressed with the results. In my case I feel that is a bit complicated to make an uniform treatment because you can not put any mark (as reference)on your skin, because of that is hard to see exactly what area you recently treated and avoid skip or overexpose some places of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you updated about the results but, until now ,I&#x27;m really happy with the progress onf mu treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.D.: My hair is black and I have white Skin. Those characteristics are good for the results according the instruction manual.</li>
    <li> Ok, first I&#x27;ll state that my hair type is dark, course, and rather fast-growing.  When I shave in the morning, I can certainly feel stubble by the night-time.  On the other hand, I have very white skin, so I&#x27;m a good candidate in that respect in contrast to my dark hair.  But I do think that results may vary based on how \\&quot;hairy\\&quot; you are to begin with.  I followed the directions TO THE LETTER for the first three treatments.  I shaved before each treatment.  I waited exactly 2 weeks between each treatment.  Incidentally, the bulb is supposed to last up to 2-3 full body treatments.  Because I  distrusted the reality of this, I only treated from my knee down each time, wanting to be able to get 3 full treatments to know if the product was working.  My thighs are always less hairy anyway, so I figured the maximum good would be done  below the knee.  I was disappointed that on my third treatment, the bulb died after I zapped only the top of one of my legs.  But I figured that I should be able to tell from just that amount whether it was going to work.  Unfortunately, while the hair seems a bit slower in growing and perhaps more sparse, it BY NO MEANS relieves me of the need to shave after three treatments.  I plan to order another bulb and continue zapping to see if my hair type simply requires more treatments.  I&#x27;m not ready to say the product doesn&#x27;t work, but I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because I gave it full and fair chance for what the product recommended and it didn&#x27;t deliver.  Also, the bulb pooped out before it should have, per the directions.  I will update after obtaining another bulb.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t even 2 minutes in and the light sensor lit up .... I was so looking forward to it but it is a bit pricey if you have to replace a bulb every 2 minutes...</li>
    <li> So I just finished my first treatment, and it feels the asme way as when I had it professionally done... Wanted to also get it done on my legs, but it is way too expensive. Thought this might be a good alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m encouraged that I didn&#x27;t waste my money based on the reviews, so I will also update my review every month on my progress to encourage or deter others to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason this particular one appealed to me are the $25 refill bulbs. I don&#x27;t feel that I have to tolerate a higher setting because the refills are pretty inexpensive - and if they last 3 treatments, the three that I have will last 6 months with treating myself every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it took about 20 min to do my arms and legs.. It&#x27;s not a big time commitment.</li>
    <li> The Remington Laser works wonders for me.  FYI I have very coarse, dark hair.  Evertyime I would shave the minute I stepped out of the shower I couldn&#x27;t even tell I had shaved.  I have done three treatments with it now and notice a drastic reduction in the hair on my legs and bikini line.  The hair is either gone or there are only thin, light colored ones left behind.  It does take a couple of weeks for the hair to fall out so don&#x27;t expect to see results right away.  I had the same experience with professional treatments anyways (at least for me).  The laser does get less painful the more treatments you do and I imagine that is because there is less hair follicles for it to reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is easy to miss spots because I avoid stacking (using the laser on the same patch of skin &gt;1 in a session) which could result in harming your skin.  Also, it is difficult to get the shins and ankle areas because of the safety on it which ensures that you have it completely pressed against the skin.  I have found that if I turn it sideways it is easier to get these difficult areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a great purchase and I am very satisified.  Thank you Remington!</li>
    <li> I have been using the I-Light once a week (on max power) for about 8 weeks.  Yes, this is much more often than the directions indicate, but I have difficult to remove hair.  I am very fair skinned with very dark hair.  Hair removal creams don&#x27;t work at all for me and I must shave every single day.  I began using this system excusively in the bikini area to prepare for a trip this Spring.  For the first 3-4 treatments, I saw ZERO results.  After the fourth treatment, I began to notice a reduction.  My bikini area is almost where I want it to be after 8 weeks so I am starting on the rest of my legs.  I believe I will always have to treat weekly to maintain any kind of result as my hair growth is much faster than most womens (when I use a razor, i get a 5o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs!!).  I am willing to continue to treat every week to avoid the daily use of a razor.  So, based on other reviews, I would say you have to play around with the treatment levels to see what works for you...and you really have to stick it out to see results</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about ordering this product.  I wanted to go office hair removal but it seemed too expensive and time consuming so based on other reviews, I gave this product a try.  I have medium to light skin and dark hair that grows on my chin, neck and upper lip.  I used to tweeze all the time and wonder if a new hair popped up that I missed that someone else could see.  My hair issues started pretty early, but got worse when I went off birth control and even worse after 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never wanted to shave my face or neck because I thought more hair would grow, well I don&#x27;t think it makes more hair grow but if you have been tweezing, it makes all the hair surface at one time and that was difficult for me to deal with at first.  I couldn&#x27;t bear to shave for 6 weeks while I undid the effects of tweezing so I started shaving and the light treatments at the same time.  I have been doing treatments for a few months now, every 2 weeks.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference but over time, a lot of the hair is gone and more and more is gone every time.  I still need to shave, but it is so much better and I am very happy with the result.  I think it&#x27;s something that needs maintenance but it&#x27;s so worth it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt?  I think I have  a low pain tolerance and it does hurt a bit, but I use the highest setting because I want the biggest effect and it is still tolerable.  It kind of feels like you are touching a hot curling iron for a second, but not enough to burn. I think the more hair you have, the more you feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long does the cartridge last?  It says 1,500 flashes.  My warning light just came on after maybe 7 treatments.  I do my under arms too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yes, I think this product is worth it.  Just be patient and persistent.</li>
    <li> Well heck guys, if the lasers at the doc&#x27;s offfices aren&#x27;t permanent why would you expect this thing to be.  Bought it, used it 24 times, and now it&#x27;s all growing back.  I had professional laser treatments at a derm&#x27;s office over the course of a year,&lt;br /&gt;and 5 years later it&#x27;s all back.  Finally decided to do some more research, and went with electrolysis.  It worked!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on things and gadgets that are not permanent.  If those things actually worked somebody would be really rich by now.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product! After the first use I noticed an immediate hair growth reduction! I have dark/thick hair and light skin so it works perfectly for me! It&#x27;s a process but the end result is definitely worth it. Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair isn&#x27;t as thick anymore..which is great! I was always insecure when people would touch my spiky legs, now I don&#x27;t care! I&#x27;m still working on my legs, I have a feeling it&#x27;s going to take awhile to get all the hair off but I&#x27;ll have to be consistent with the laser hair removal. So far so good! I&#x27;m happy and semi-hairless! haha &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I have had this system for about a year.  I used it on my underarms, bikini area and my upper and lower legs.  It seems people are getting mixed results, but I am extremely happy with this device.  I started off using it every 2 weeks for the first 2 months on my legs.  The hair on my legs grows back so slowly now, I use it about every 3 weeks but only doing spot treatment areas where I see a little hair growth.  So although it started off time consuming, it really goes rather quickly now just doing some light maintenance.  I used to have to shave my legs every day and now I do it every 4 weeks.  The bikini area was not done as frequently especially during the cold months when not swimming.  There is a significant reduction in the hair growth but still needs to be maintained every 2 weeks if I was wearing a bathing suit regularly.  My armpit hair has always been fine since I only plucked.  So I can now go 3 months without retreating that area.  The cartridge replacements are only about $25 now.  I replaced mine 3 times in this last year.  But I would think that rate would decrease since I don&#x27;t need to use it as often and not covering large areas each time.  I would recommend this device since it worked for me.</li>
    <li> I have a high pain tolerance, but this snapped quite a bit, even on the lowest setting.  It was liking snapping a rubber band against my skin.  It was really hard to do this to myself because I knew it was going to hurt. Unfortunately, the lowest setting was not enough to take care of the problem. I&#x27;m disappointed for the price that it was essentially a waste for me.</li>
    <li> Love this! Have had it for a while now. No regrets! Easy to use and works well!</li>
    <li> Get ready to buy a cartridge every other treatment , I did see minimal results after about 4 treatments  .</li>
    <li> This item is well made, sold at a great price, easy transaction and timely arrival. I recommend this seller and product. AAA++++</li>
    <li> Good product. Recommended</li>
    <li> So I just bought this and I used it yesterday. I normally have to shave everyday and I used it for the first time yesterday. I had it on the highest energy level for my legs, but I&#x27;m worried that the machine isn&#x27;t strong enough. I have had LHR by a professional done before, and I know the strength of the laser doesn&#x27;t compare. I realize that it obviously can&#x27;t because the general public wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it. However, I am worried that the laser isn&#x27;t strong enough for me. Does anyone know if it&#x27;s possible to maybe use it two days in a row? I know the process takes time, but I had to shave the next day and I really didn&#x27;t see any effect from the laser. If anyone has an answer or any advice about it please let me know. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update on my progress.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first treatment on my upper legs and bikini line. After doing the patch test a couple of weeks ago I used it at full strength. I should add that I have fair skin and thick, black hair.  For anyone worried about pain I have to say this was almost pain free.  I felt heat with each pulse of light and occasionally a light flick.  I had my bikini line done professionally and didn&#x27;t find that painful either, that felt like a rubber band snap to me.  They system is very easy to use and treatment went pretty quick, maybe 30 minutes to go do both legs, just the upper area.  After reading other reviews I didn&#x27;t worry about getting full coverage, if this works as well as some have said I will happily do spot treatments to clean up areas I&#x27;ve missed. I will report back after next treatment.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews here about how the cartridges that come with the product don&#x27;t last and it seems to be true.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product on Tuesday and used it a couple of times on tiny areas just testing the results before using it on bigger spots. I used it only once and when I got it and i decided to try it on another area today (sunday). By the 3rd flash today it stopped working. The cartridge had died and I haven&#x27;t even reached 30 flashes. The good thing is that I already had bought another cartridge and it worked immediately.&lt;br /&gt;For now I&#x27;m giving the product a 2 because of the publicity deception used by remington which claims a 1500 flash per cartridge which is completely untrue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try to update this review with results in the upcoming months but if the 2nd cartridge fails after 30 flashes again then I&#x27;m returning it because paying 25$ every week isn&#x27;t really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st update(After 2 weeks): First of all I would like to say that the refill cartridge I had bought with the machine is still working properly. As for the results, after only two sessions (2 weeks apart) you can start noticing that the hair is growing a lot slower than it used to. I will keep updating the result as the treatment goes along.&lt;br /&gt;On a side note I would like to thank Remington&#x27;s customer service for doing a great job to insure their clients&#x27; satisfaction using their product.</li>
    <li> The writeup does not include - does not work on white/blonde hair.  It&#x27;s a lot of money to spend to find out that it will not work!  It also does not work on dark skin - FYI.  That is explained in the DVD - a little bit late.  Unit was returned in a hurry</li>
    <li> I had professional laser hair removal done about 5 years ago.  I spent thousands of dollars foolishly thinking it was permanent.  LASER HAIR REMOVAL IN ANY FORM IS NOT PERMANENT. However, regrowth 5 years later is only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the original amount of hair, but still enough to require shaving/epilation/waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought this unit last night and did a full body treatment on level 5 (including chin, level 4... I know) and I can already tell it&#x27;s going to work.  It doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as painful as professional treatments but I&#x27;m okay with that haha!  And yes, I will update on how this thing is working in a few months, but probably only if it&#x27;s not working. So consider no news to be good news. Oh yeah this thing comes with a two year manufacturer warranty which is nice to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I could smell the burnt hair during treatment, just like I did during the professional treatments.&lt;br /&gt;2) Before treatment (last night), I would normally feel stubble regrowth within 24 hours after shaving.  After one full body treatment (after shaving of course) I&#x27;m not getting a normal rate of \\&quot;growth\\&quot;. Meaning the hair does not seem to be growing. I&#x27;m pretty sure the hair follicles are dead, just as this product claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely spent $25 on cartridges. My prediction is I will go through 4 cartridges over the next 2 months, and then probably one every couple of months or so for touch ups. Hopefully fewer, but I am absolutely more than willing to pay the price. It is literally less than 1/10th of the cost of professional treatments, and probably will never add up the long run.  To do underarms only, most places will charge $100 each treatment, and you need like 4-5! I can do a full body, twice, for $25!!! I&#x27;m just saying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin, dark hair - prime candidate (I apologize to you dark skinned gals, maybe they&#x27;ll find a way!!) - and freckles - so far no burning or blistering!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-not messyat all like epilating and waxing, clean up is easy because there is no cleanup! Wipe the glass (cloth provided), unplug, and wrap the cord. No sticky wax and oil residue or little hairs all over the bathroom floor to sweep up.&lt;br /&gt;-less time required for treatment. It took about 1.5 hours for full body, vs 2.5 hours epilating/waxing&lt;br /&gt;-you don&#x27;t have to let the hair grow out before treating it!! So you don&#x27;t ever have to wear pants in July, or postpone that hot date again!!&lt;br /&gt;-privacy! You can do your nether regions without having to bare all to a total stranger&lt;br /&gt;-no razor burn, ingrown hairs, hairs growing long under the skin that you have to scrape out and pluck using tweezers&lt;br /&gt;-laser hair removal lasts waaaaaaay longer than epilating and waxing does, you&#x27;ll probably only have to shave maybe once a week, or once every other week and probably mainly only for the little blond hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Nada!</li>
    <li> I actually got this for myself as a birthday/Christmas gift this year after having tried a friend&#x27;s last spring - I love it! I&#x27;m way too budget-conscious to spend $$$$ for a laser center hair removal treatment. My argument was always, \\&quot;You know how many fancy razors and shave gel I can buy for that?!\\&quot; This guy is perfect and right at the affordable price point where I can justify all the saved money, time and hassle with razors, especially with traveling and summertime just around the corner. Shipping was great, and overall no complaints!</li>
    <li> 2013.03.14 So far 95 % of my arm and leg hair is gone. In areas where the hair is courser like the bikini area it&#x27;s down by 60% and facial hair is down by 35%. I have to send my unit in for warranty repair because flexing the cable makes it not work at times or cause the panel lights to flash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013.02.05: 3rd session. Looking at my hair prior to treating it I noticed that about 50% of my arm and 30% of my leg hair isn&#x27;t growing back now. Pubic hair maybe 20% reduced. It seems that the courser the hair is the more resistant it is. I&#x27;m keeping tabs on lamp life using my tips listed below which so far are working by preventing the lamp from overheating. Read \\&quot;Extending Lamp Life\\&quot; below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2013.01.18: I&#x27;m on my 2nd session which didn&#x27;t make it halfway before the lamp wore out. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than a few hundred flashes (not that I counted them). Could it be shipping damage? Dunno. I&#x27;ll do some sample counting next time to estimate the number of flashes when the new lamps come. I think it might be my rapid fire use of it the first session that wore the lamp out faster. It did get quite warm but not to kick into overheat mode. In a couple places I have to turn it back to 3 so it didn&#x27;t sting so much. The only thing I notice at this early stage is a bit of itching or irritation in spots. I&#x27;ll see what happens in the next month...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original: I tried my first small session today and my impression is that it&#x27;s plenty powerful enough and the unit build quality looks great. I wound up using level 4 and 5 with my pale skin and brown hair. Mostly it felt like a pinch with heat flash but a couple spots felt more like a shock and probably because of more hair follicles. They say that the higher the level you can stand the better it takes the hair out. Of course I&#x27;m judging the correct level by how each flash should typically feel as well as noticing if the skin is not being adversely harmed. After the session I don&#x27;t feel any discomfort or notice any redness or injury at all on the treated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read some of the low star reviews before buying as I will do but many seem verging on hysteria, conspiracy, or don&#x27;t know how to use the thing. If you&#x27;re going to write a review good or bad keep it factual and sober otherwise it appears that you&#x27;re making it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT!: As the manual said, pull the nose off and check the lamp cart in case it came loose in shipping. Mine was loose and one pin was misaligned so I bent it straight and the cart seated in snugly. If I hadn&#x27;t read that in the manual the unit wouldn&#x27;t have worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review and star rating as I go with how it performs over the months...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extending Lamp Life&lt;br /&gt;Some people complaint about short lamp life, which I too have experienced. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good design as far as keeping the lamp cool and the heat eventually makes it fail prematurely. My advise is to slow down how fast you flash the unit so that the flash tube stays cooler and doesn&#x27;t fracture from overheating and don&#x27;t block the air vents of the hand piece. I&#x27;m keeping the flash intervals at greater than 4 seconds with rest periods of a minute if I feel any little amount of warmth of the air venting out of the hand unit. Using a longer flash interval of probably 6 - 8 seconds would probably be okay for continuous use. Never get impatient and start flashing it fast for little stint, that could be all you need to overheat the tube. Leave the unit on and fan running if you take breaks in your session. Every bit of cooling will help. From my experience I think you&#x27;ll be able to extend the lamp&#x27;s life but it will still fail prematurely due to lots of tiny heat cracks forming in the tube to a point where they leak. My current lamp I estimate is getting close to it&#x27;s maximum flash count using a 4 to 6 second flash interval but it still has developed a fine tangle of tiny fractures all around the cathode but none big enough to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell the problem lies in the way the reflectors in front and behind the tube shroud it from the cooling air so it doesn&#x27;t cool very fast because no real airflow is happening within the confines of the reflectors to cool the center section of the tube. It&#x27;s a shame such a great product has this flaw, but at least it can be partially worked around. This unit really should have been designed with a much higher airflow to cool the lamp and maybe have incorporated some heatsinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Tips to Extend the Lamp Life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1, I keep cotton swabs and isopropyl alcohol on hand while using the unit, to clean the vaporized debris off of the lens whenever anything is seen on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2, Between uses pull the hand unit nose off and see if the back of the lens and reflective surfaces are clean and shiny. Also look at the lamp&#x27;s reflector. It may develop a haze on it. To clean that off I remove the lamp. hold it over a sink and have a small spray bottle with isopropyl alcohol in it that I spray the reflector and tube with. Then I carefully shake the alcohol off and use a hair dryer to dry the lamp off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the Lamp Fails (The technical version)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Xenon flash tube inside of the lamp if overheated develops small fractures that allow the gas inside to seep out. The cracks occur right around the tip of the cathode electrode which is the larger of the two inside the tube and the one that will heat up greatly since that&#x27;s where the arcing starts. The intense blast of the arc and heat build up eventual causes the nearby quartz tube glass to fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So other than the tube failing how does the unit know when the lamp has \\&quot;expired\\&quot; at 1,500 flashes? Well when I had the lamp apart I noticed a little \\&quot;transistor\\&quot; inside. I looked up the part number an it turns out to be a serially programmed EEPROM. Basically a tiny bit of memory that can store a number. The unit reads the number when turned on adds how many flashes you use and then loads the new number count back into that EEPROM. Apparently Remington deems the lamp&#x27;s power level to be deteriorated enough at 1,500 flashes that it&#x27;s out of spec as far as maintaining performance.o fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a nutshell the problem lies in the way the reflectors in front and behind the tube shroud it from the cooling air so it doesn&#x27;t cool very fast because no real airflow is happening within the confines of the reflectors to cool the center section of the tube.

    <li> So I have PCOS which means I&#x27;m way harrier than I would like.  I bought this item in hopes that I could keep from having to avail myself of expensive laser treatment, and I am impressed. Now understand that I have very fair skin with dark terminal hair in places that I don&#x27;t want it.  I&#x27;ve now completed 3 treatments and the amount of hair in the treated areas is markedly reduced. What is more the remaining hair is growing at a much slower rate.  Now I am not completely hairless in the treated areas, and I don&#x27;t expect that I will obtain that type of result. However I have gone from having to pluck, shave, or use hair removal creams on a daily basis to only having to pluck every 3-4 days. It&#x27;s the first time since I was 18 years old where I can go 3-4 days without plucking and still be able to leave the house without embarrassment. This is an outstanding result, and better than I was anticipating. And these are results that I have obtained while not following all the directions exactly (i.e. I continued to pluck hair even on the day of treatments, so I could have probably gotten better results if I had let my hair grow for the suggested 5-7 days worth of time before treatments, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said there are some drawbacks- 1. I have already had to replace the flash-bulb that came with it, and I certainly hadn&#x27;t used it the advertised 1500 times.  2. The design of the handheld device is awkward, it&#x27;s a little bit too small to make treating large areas like legs easy.  It is difficult to get it into a good position over curved areas as you have to make good contact with the skin before it will flash, and it is a little bit too large to treat smaller areas easily.  I really wish that it came with several different size options, but what can you do. 3. This item will reduce hair, but it is not going to make you hairless, so if that is your goal you may want to try something different.</li>
    <li> I bought this last Feb (2012) and I love it. The first place I used it was on my face and it is such a relief not to have bleach, tweeze or wax any more and it only requires occasional touch-ups.&lt;br /&gt;When I think of all the time, money and angst that I have spent over the years a measly $250 and 2 spare light bulbs is a very small price to pay for the results I have gotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read some other reviews and I wonder about the dissatisfaction. It doesn&#x27;t promise to immediately make all your hair disappear and it doesn&#x27;t do that. It takes weeks and you have to have patience. If if was all that easy why would the \\&quot;professionals\\&quot; charge so much. Even when you have a professional do it you have to go back for touch-ups, it is a never ending process, just less frequent over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite purchases and only wish I had had it 20 years ago when I was in my 20s.</li>
    <li> My wife has the fortune, as regards this product, to be the precise demographic for which this product is best suited --- namely, light skin dark hair.  She has now done two treatments with two weeks between and she is a few days out from the interval for her next treatment.  We both can see good reduction in regrowth, both in quantity and coarseness.  She is 100% pleased.  Therefore, we confirm, if you are the right demographic, this works.</li>
    <li> I read carefully the instruction, and applied to my skin, the first 5 flashes are normal, then the device stopped emitting the flash. I turned off and turned on and repeated the procedure, there is no flash. As the instruction said, either the cartilage or bulb has problem (possibly  they send me a returned device!)&lt;br /&gt;Since I always trust the result of the aesthetics medical device, and have operated some devices in the salon for years, I decided to give this device a second chance, return it and replace a new one, I will post my experience when I receive the new one.</li>
    <li> Not for African Americans with Carmel to Dark Brown completion! Burned me!!!</li>
    <li> very good but I had a bad luck with battery and had to chage.  Recommended</li>
    <li> Sent this item back to manufacturer.  Hand piece fan was Intermittently turning on and off and the system would not work.  Ordered new light cartridge to eliminate this as a reason, but still did not work.  Called Remington Customer Service for troubleshooting.  Asked to send product back.  After spending $300 (unit plus extra light cartridges) I do not have this item and am told I need to wait 2 more weeks for a replacement.  Does not seem that I should be without after spending money on a product that should work.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use and does everything it promised.  I would buy one again if it were available to purchase.</li>
    <li> You need to have the right expectations for this device. It does seem to work and will eliminate some hair. What it did not do for me is to eliminate all hair that I wanted gone. That includes dark hair that it might be expected to work on. On the other hand, professional IPL treatments are going to set you back the cost of this device every visit or two,</li>
    <li> Have just begun using and it says it takes weeks for results so check back with me in a few weeks</li>
    <li> It does the job but is not forever. Don&#x27;t start crying after 6 months not using it and your hair is back, just start again. It just makes it easier and painless (in my opinion).I wish the cartridges lasted longer though</li>
    <li> First, you should buy some protective eye wear that filters white light.  The flash is VERY bright and hurt my eyes so much that I had to close them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit to get used to but once you get the hang of it it goes fast for this type of product.  I did both legs in less than 30 minutes.  The first week I didn&#x27;t have to shave again for five days.  I&#x27;ve only done two treatments and I&#x27;m already down to shaving only once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started on the lowest setting but soon moved up to the mid-level setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the product came with the protective eye wear or at least had mention that you might want to purchase it but thankfully Amazon suggested the purchase when I added it to my cart.</li>
    <li> I am Irish American and blonde with pale white skin and lots of freckles. If I never shaved when I was little I would never have to however since I have I have to shave all the time. I have used this for the first 3 sessions and it has been one week since I have shaved last. Previous to using this I would feel like a bushman after a day or two of not shaving and now it feels like its only been a day or two after a week. So yes this does work and it sure beats paying a ton of money at a spa getting all your parts exposed to other people... As if regular check ups weren&#x27;t bad enough. My arm pits are completely bare and my legs and bikini are dramatically reduced! I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s not all gone but the reduction of hair which has reduced the razor burn and ingrown hairs has been a god send! I will probably never  be able to have it all gone anyway because I&#x27;m blonde, but getting the majority of it has been really great! So for me it&#x27;s just what is it worth to you. The thing does what it needs to and the price and privacy of your own home beats a million times over getting it done professionally!!! I was stuck for a long time trying to figure out what to do and reading all the reviews and doing research and I finally gave up and got it. I&#x27;m very glad i did. Hope this helps! By the way I got headaches when I used it the 1st 2x even though I didn&#x27;t look at the flash so I bought $3 laser glasses or whatever they are and was fine the 3rdx... Happy grooming ;)</li>
    <li> I was spending 80 a session for laser.  Item isn&#x27;t as effective so i use it more often.  Worth it to save money.  Hurts less! !!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Been using on the face even though the directions frown on it.  Results are quicker than expected.</li>
    <li> I purchases this product to help me reduce my facial hair. I procrastinated to buy the product due to reviews and did not want to spend money if the product was not going to work. I did not follow direction recommended by the product, insted, I used it daily. My facial hair was getting thicker, as I have a condition called hirsutism. I have been plucking but it did not seem to help. I was very tired of doing this and it stained my chin, I have sensitive skin. As soon as I got this product, I shaved and used it daily. At first my hair got thicker and I was worried I had made a mistake, nonethelss, I continue my session daily. After, a month of use, I have seen result. My facial hair is no longer thick, my chin skin is not as stained (I am applying a cream to reduce dark spots), in some areas of my face there is no hair. I am letting grow to see how it looks and it is growing thinner and fine hair. I no longer get those little black spots, and I am happy. I feel free to expose my face to the sun, Knowing that my facial skin is not at dark due to the plucking and my facial hair is fine to none at all. I feel very feminine and can&#x27;t wait to see my partner and let him touch my face. I did not let him do so, I was to embarrass, although, he knows of my condition. I still felt very uncomfortable but not anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased the iLight Pro through Costco and haven&#x27;t regretted it a bit, although I was a little disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t recommend use on the face.  So I used it on my legs and underarms instead.  After only two treatments, I haven significantly less hair.  Usually, I must shave my legs and underarms daily to avoid unpleasant stubble.  Today is Friday and the last time I shaved was Sunday morning.  There are a few hairs on my legs...one more treatment needed, I think to eliminate those pesty hairs.  But the rest of my legs are smooth and hair-free and most of the hairs under my arms are also gone.  I love this product!  My only reason for giving it four stars instead of five is that the bulb needed to be replaced before I finished my second complete application on my legs.  I&#x27;ve since signed up for replacement bulbs every six months from Remington, which results in a significant reduction of price.</li>
    <li> I have used this product probably six times under the arms, little bit on the belly, and about x4 on the bikini area. I definitely can say that their is less hair and it grows in way slower. The difference is very noticeable under the arms. I am still waiting for better results in the bikini area. I would say this is worth the money and it works.</li>
    <li> This thing has saved me from shaving quite a few times! The hair does grow back and it hurts like a rubber band on some parts of the body but its worth it. When i let my leg hairs grow out you can see a lot of spots of hair that are probably never going to grow back now because of using this product alone. The thicker the hair the more its going to hurt. The lighter your skin the more it works. If your darker skin in complextion it might hurt more then usually if you use it. I have a tattoo on my right leg and i got it 2 times with the laser. It blistered up and made my tattoo go away... So there are some benefits but be careful.</li>
    <li> I actually think this one is starting to work!  I bought a tria and was disappointed with the lack of results.  Although Id like to be hair free I do think its thinning more.</li>
    <li> I had returned this product, because I thought it would be great for facial hair removal. It stressed it was not for the face so I returned it.</li>
    <li> Not as expected but I think its a personal choice. Husband hated it to....he said he would rather wax. LOL likely returning if its not a huge ordeal.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair removal system for about 2 months now and I&#x27;m pleased as punch with the results. My story:  I&#x27;m an attractive 38 year old professional, natural light blonde hair--not exactly who you&#x27;d picture as a prime candidate for this thing.  But I&#x27;ve been battling facial hair since I was about 14 years old.  I&#x27;ve plucked, shaved, waxed, and spent thousands of dollars that I didn&#x27;t have in my 20&#x27;s paying for laser hair removal at a clinic/salon that specialized in this.  And NOTHING worked.  About 10 years ago I just resigned myself to being sasquatch face and staying out of direct sunlight while keeping my chin pointed down.  The only people that really knew were my sister (suffers from the same problem), my hair dresser and my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways my sister told me about this product and how well it worked so I had to give it a try.  All the black hair is gone, and I am now in maintenance mode just using once a week or so. This isn&#x27;t however a magic bullet!  A lot of my hair is blonde which is does nothing for.  I&#x27;ll have to make an effort to get electrolysis for the rest of it.  Totally worth the what?  $200. Don&#x27;t go to the clinics - HUGE waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I am turning into the hairy guy on the beach.  My stomach and back started to become one patch of hair.  I could continue, but I&#x27;m sure you get the picture.  I did not want to consider the cost of professional hair removal because it would cost too much.  If this device would slow hair growth and eliminate some hair, I would be happy.  By the way, I have fair skin and dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment turns out to be far quicker than I expected. I do not want to be completely hairless, so I am not worried if I hit every hair.  I do not notice a difference in discomfort from 1-5.  It feels the same, so I leave it on the highest setting.  Arm pits can be a little uncomfortable and parts of the neckline can be uncomfortable.  If you have a tattoo DO NOT hit it with this machine.  It will hurt and cause blisters and loss of tattoo color, but that should be expected since the direction says not to hit tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first treatment I noticed absolutely no results.  I decided to apply treatments every 4 days, instead of once a week. I noticed slower growth from weeks 3-6.  Spots I was shaving twice a week would not need to be shaved.  After 6 weeks, the hair is completely gone with minor touch up areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, it&#x27;s almost impossible to ensure the window covers everything, so you are going to have patches that you&#x27;ve missed.  Its much quicker to treat the hair patches than to spend hours trying to make sure you&#x27;ve covered everything the first time and it will be less uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m a real person. I won this off of ebay really cheap,  the previous owner said it hurt too badly. I thought no pain no gain. First off,  I did alllll the research, blah blah &amp; even though this was old, it had the most positive reviews..so I thought why not? I brought this with no expectation of fast results,  I thought it would take a year for it to be permanent. I&#x27;m African American, caramel complexion and I thought it would be tough for me especially since I have some ingrown hairs. And  wait it says not to use on your face/kneck and I said whatever and did, not above the chin though.  Anyway I searched for home remedies to ease the pain and I found that ice does it! I started on my stomach &amp; waited the two weeks and I noticed my hair growing back sloooowly in some areas and some areas clear..patchy. I used the first setting btw. I then did my breasts..yes I am a man woman...lol and I was icing,  but it got time consuming so I just said eff it and started \\&quot;ouching\\&quot; away on the 2nd setting. 2 weeks later,  same thing some hairs there, some not. I then did my kneck and it&#x27;s iffy, but I just did it again and I think I got it good this time. Prior too I shave and clean..no waxing or plucking. But needless to say I&#x27;m seeing results. Whether it&#x27;s growing slowly or not at all I&#x27;m fine with that. I get to do it more often now since you have to wait 2 weeks after you first use it. This time I&#x27;ll use setting 3. I stopped icing and I take it like a pro. ;)  I get to hold on to my sexy for a little bit longer. Eventually I&#x27;ll do my under arms and bikini line..but I love it! :) Just in time for Summer. And I still have plenty of flashes left on my first cartridge.</li>
    <li> not what I thought it would be. I would not spend the money on it again. Better off going to a laser hair removal place. You get better results.</li>
    <li> I have done the hair removing creams and the NO NO device...the creams don&#x27;t work well and burn your skin and the NO NO simply doesn&#x27;t work AT ALL!! This product does! Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Why spend a fortune in laser or IPL sessions to remove your hair when you have this!&lt;br /&gt;I have a fare skin and have been using the I-Light-Pro for  a while now. Efficiency on hair removal is remarkable. Burned a couple of time at the beginning, cause of the darker skin, but now that I understand the power of this Hair removal system I&#x27;m just using this a nothing else. Duration of light cartridge is pretty good.</li>
    <li> I fit the profile of what would be a good fit for this system, I followed all of the directions, I used it regularly and it did nothing. It did not work on any part of my body and it is painful.</li>
    <li> Could not use on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend for my hair, grey&lt;br /&gt;Can be used by arms, legs and darker hair.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommend for seniors with hair on their chins.</li>
    <li> Very painful to use.  Could smell burning.</li>
    <li> It works but very slowly, especially when you have coarse hair. I&#x27;ve been using it every week since I got it and I see patches of hair that are gone. The bulbs lasted me 4 treatments for my leg. I do it before shaving so I can see the hairs that need to be zapped. If you can tolerate pain use it on setting 5!&lt;br /&gt;For the people that say it does&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s not a one time treatment you have to be very dilligent and use it, like I said I use it every week. Even the professional lazer treat ment won&#x27;t get the hairs in one treatment!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  I&#x27;m only giving it a 4-star for two reasons:  1) I don&#x27;t think the cartridges last as long as advertised.  Some seem to last longer than others but I don&#x27;t count the flashes. I just make sure I always have a replacement. But at $25 a pop, it&#x27;s still a huge money saver over going to the aesthetician. In CA this has to be a registered nurse working under a doctor&#x27;s supervision, so it is costly getting it done professionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It simply doesn&#x27;t work as fast as going to a professional. However, with the savings in mind, I don&#x27;t mind that it might take twice as long, or 3 times or 4 times or more even!  Let me put it this way, I spent over $1500 in professional treatments for only my chin and bikini line (both areas very narrowly defined), which worked great, but they were very small areas.  The idea of doing my underarms, legs, or arms was out of the question financially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So both disadvantages are really irrelevant when you factor in the cost savings.  Additionally the convenience of doing it at home, without having to make an appointment 2 weeks in advance is a huge advantage. Also, I can focus on stray or single hairs as I find them, which isn&#x27;t really possible when you go into the salon. My entire *extended* bikini area is very clear now, with rarely a need to ever shave. I&#x27;ve worked on my underarms 3 or 4 times and it has reduced my shaving from once a day to once a week.  I&#x27;ve worked on my legs 3 or 4 times, which is really hard to do thoroughly because of the irregular and large area, but this has reduced my shaving from daily to once or twice a week.  And both underarms and legs are smoother after shaving and longer between shavings. Even my boyfriend noticed how smooth my underarms looked (after shaving, you could still see the black follicles).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are not supposed to use this on your face, but I do.  Even professionally, the nurse could not completely eliminate all the chin hairs.  She mentioned to me that chin hairs seemed really tough... But with this unit, I&#x27;m able to keep up on it and I&#x27;ve gone from plucking maybe 10-20 hairs a day to maybe seeing one or two a week, Which I clip short with a trimmer until I&#x27;m ready to use the unit. I also used it on stray eyebrow hairs and they have disappeared after only a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the best way to use it is concerned, I think you are reducing the effectiveness if you use it while the hairs are too long or too short.  So I use it the day after I shave, so there is a little melanin/stubble just above the surface to draw the energy for the laser.  But if the hair is too long, the energy is wasted burning the hair itself and less energy reaches the root of the hair.  Also, you need to keep the reflective surface clean, and don&#x27;t use cotton swabs (unless wrapped by the cloth that comes with the unit) or paper towels. The cleaner the surface, the better the energy is transmitted to the hair follicle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing to keep in mind is that dark hair will respond best, and you may not realize that the hair on your legs or arms really isn&#x27;t as dark as you think it may be.  Which I think is what is going on with my legs. My legs are definitely smoother, and the area is hard to work on without missing spots, so it is taking awhile to do.  But again, one treatment at the salon is $550. It would need a minimum of 3-4 treatments.  That&#x27;s over 2 grand! So if one cartridge at $25 does both my legs, and my legs end up requiring 10 treatments, that&#x27;s only 10% the cost! But the reality is that I could do my legs (usually) 3 or 4 times with one cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I see Remington is coming out with an even more powerful version.  I think it&#x27;s about $300 right now.  I&#x27;m debating on getting that one now, because it&#x27;s still a huge savings compared to going to the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re a good candidate for laser hair removal, this is a great way to save a lot of money and practically clear away all your unwanted body hair. You just need to be patient and to use it properly.</li>
    <li> I bought it online. When it got here, it wouldn&#x27;t work. All the lights blink at once, and it won&#x27;t start.&lt;br /&gt;Customers service in Brazil contacted me and said it is most likely a problem with the cartridge. They promised to send me a new cartridge in the mail this week. Looking forward to being able to finally use the product!</li>
    <li> this is kinda hard to work with and tempermental.</li>
    <li> The product works but you have to have patience. I have not followed the directions so I give this review with a disclaimer: following my treatment process may cause harm to your skin with possible burns and scars. You follow my treatment process at your own risk. My treatment process may not work for everyone. This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with the package but it bears repeating since I admit to not following the directions but I am receiving good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what the product DOES NOT do: It does not work quickly, definitely NOT on blonde or white hair (don&#x27;t even try), and if your skin is dark enough, at the time of use, you know, when you tan enough in the summer to get those nice white noticeable tan lines, then your skin may be too dark and the machine may not even turn on to use. Basically, it&#x27;s for caucasians. That&#x27;s not racist, it&#x27;s just the way the technology works. The light is attracted to the dark hair follicle and basically burns it enough over time that it pretty much dies and the hair doesn&#x27;t grow anymore or takes a super long time to grow back. (Hence, the reason that darker skin tones should not use the machine. Dark hair gets burned and so can dark skin; get it? ) And, yes, it can grow back but as I&#x27;ve said it can take a super long time. That&#x27;s why you need maintenance treatments about every 6 months once the initial treatments are done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say DO NOT use it on your face. I do, only because I know my skin and hair growth cycle and a plethora of other things about my dermatology that regular folks don&#x27;t normally know. No, I&#x27;m not a doctor, just a 30 year veteran of suffering from ugly chin and mustache hair; since puberty. Thank you hormones. I was always at the high end of the normal range hormonally so no doctor would touch me hormonally for fear of turning me into a Yeti or maybe a man. I didn&#x27;t want that either. So, depilatories (which I also don&#x27;t recommend for the face; I learned the hard way), shaving, waxing, plucking, and electrolysis were my alternatives for the last 30 years. Yeah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say use every 2 weeks for 6 weeks in a row and then when hair appears or every 6 months after for maintenance. I have been using it on my face every week (see disclaimer above) for about 8 weeks now and I am seeing results. I also use under my arms, which is allowed, and am seeing results there too. You must shave the area really close. Yeesh, back to that again. Do not use the product for at least an hour after shaving. Must be clean and dry, no deodorants or skin creams or even moisture. It works better if you&#x27;re not sweating. Use a grid like pattern in the area you want to remove hair. It takes me about 15 minutes and about 50 pulses to do my chin, lip, and under arms. Yes, it stings, but less than electrolysis and the hair follicles don&#x27;t get infected and cause pimples. I use setting 5. It might not sting on lower settings. I have high pain tolerance. To get the unit to even turn on you&#x27;re supposed to put the body part to be pulsed on the sensor which is kind of weird because you would have to pick up the unit and put it under your arm or wherever. I just use my forearm. Exfoliate, exfoliate! Helps remove dead hair and keeps ingrowns at bay due to the shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results: I had a couple of long hairs in sideburn area that are gone, my upper lip fine hairs are gone, and along my jawline are thinning out, as well as, my neck. White hairs I plucked and won&#x27;t be back, they were dead anyway, no follicle attached. My under arms are also thinning. I have a couple of thick hairs at corners of my lip but I knew they&#x27;ll take more time. Same as the other areas. Time, patience, and routine is a must. I cannot stress this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s expensive but it&#x27;s worth the investment considering my treatment at a dermatologist would cost me around $2,000 + considering my hair growth cycle and coarseness of hair. I did my researchand this is also an FDA approved product for home use. Do your own research and be an educated consumer. I just wanted everyone to know the product worked for me. I guess I could have said that in a shorter review but details sometimes mean the difference. Good luck!</li>
    <li> The BIGGEST reason this doesn&#x27;t work for other folks is that they aren&#x27;t using it right. I used one lamp so far, and it is WONDERFUL! I did my treatments ever 2 weeks after I used my epilator. IMO using the epilator makes it work faster. I had problem facial and body hair all my life, now it barely grows after just one lamp. I go about 3 weeks between epilator treatments now. It used to be 10 days. Use an epilator first then the i Light. Be patient, this really does work it just takes time. I expect top be hair free by April</li>
    <li> Love it, so far it has been not only effective, it really doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad as the salons and it&#x27;s nice to be able to do it in the privacy of my home.</li>
    <li> I had professional laser hair removal on my lower legs and underarms and I wanted to purchase this to take care of some smaller areas as well as areas that were missed from my professional sessions. I decided that a really good indicator would be to test this on my underarms as it was a small area with about 20-30 hairs left over that the laser sessions had missed. I had one treatment of professional laser left to do, but I never made time to go back as the clinic was really far from my house. Since I wanted to try this product anyway I thought I would try this area first as it would allow me to really be able to keep track of how much hair was being removed. I am the typical \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; candidate for laser as I have very white skin and dark thick hair thanks to my Greek and Italian decent. My first impression of the system was that it was completely painless....too painless. I felt nothing even on the highest level which made me really question whether or not it would be effective. Professional laser hair removal hurt- BADLY- which was not fun, but as most ladies know, beauty is not painless and it did produce great results. Anyway I followed the instructions provided in terms of timing the treatments. After the first 2 treatments I noticed zero difference in growth but I continued to a third, fourth, and fifth treatment. After the fifth treatment there were no hairs growing under my arm AT ALL! I was thrilled. I no longer had to shave those strays every day and I felt confident that I had made the right decision to purchase this. I had planned to move on to larger areas such as the upper leg and bikini area. Unfortunately after about 10 weeks of no shaving all of the hair grew back and continues to grow at the same rate that it did before. I think that this product is still a good investment as even going 10 weeks of being hair free makes life more convenient, but don&#x27;t expect the same results as professional laser hair removal...in fact don&#x27;t even expect 6 months of being hair free as the literature provided with this unit suggests. The amount of time to \\&quot;zap\\&quot; a few small areas after a shower is minimal and the refills are priced reasonably. It&#x27;s worth a try, but if you really want lasting results I think you will still have to shell out the bucks for a professional.f being hair free as the literature provided with this unit suggests.

    <li> My wife used this exactly as indicated for 6 months with absolutely NO reduction in hair growth.  She is fair skinned with dark hair - should be perfect, right?  Nope.  Now she&#x27;s paid for this junk and is going in for real laser hair removal.  Save your money for the pros, folks.  This is a total waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product works in time about after 1-2 months I saw see some results. By the 3-4 month I experienced visible results. Treatment regimen was varied depending on the area treated, I overlapped over the harder /thicker hair areas. Started out using the highest setting since this product delivers less power compared to more expensive higher end products. As far as the bulb life I documented the number of flashes though have not added it up and will add that information later. Small treatment window so it will take some patience treating the larger areas. Would recommend this product as far as value so far, though the price came 1-2 months after purchase, also a spare bulb should of been included with unit and would make this a a ideal purchase. In case the 1 shipped bulb were defective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using according with the instructions. I hope it be very good! I already like it.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. Quit working all together after about six months. Very disappointing. Even when it was &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;, it didn&#x27;t work at removing, or even reducing hair growth.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with result</li>
    <li> This may take a while to have an effect so I am continuing to try it- Remington customer service is great, top-notch!</li>
    <li> ok so i bought the ilight. before i opend it i read the manual and it said it hasnt been cleared for back hair, which completely confuses me and pisses me off. and i just went on the website and it says NOTHING about treating back hair. i really dont get this product so i guess im going to buy the tria. if anyone has used this on their back please let me know.</li>
    <li> i got this product 6 months ago and have been doing treatments every week (had to buy more cartriges)i have dark hair and white white skin so it should have worked realy well. i have not seen any noticible results. i did have to miss 4 treatments tho because amazon did not ship my replacment cartrige on time (4 weeks late and then i had to re order and wait another week)there was one patch in my bikini area that was totally bare (the size n shape of the light) but within 2 weeks hair was growing back there too. i am going to keep trying for another couple months and then maybe i will break down and get it done professionally because its been such a tease expecting my hair to go away!</li>
    <li> I purchased this IPL 6 weeks ago, and withheld my review until I used it for the minimum 1 month/3 sessions recommended in the instructions. I even waited until after the 4th use. I give it 3 stars because it is doing something, just not the &amp;#34;promised&amp;#34; (expected) hairless body parts they claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have olive skin, and dark hair. When using this device you need to make sure you shave well. You will still feel the device &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; the hair at the roots - it does give off a pungent smell like burning hair. I have used it on 5 for my chest and stomach, and started at 3 for my underarms and neck (up to my jawline, which is NOT recommended by Remington). I have since gone up to the full 5 everywhere, and the &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; I get is trivial other than on my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 sessions, I find that the hair on my chest has thinned some but it still grows. My stomach hairs have gotten less course, but have not slowed growing at all. The underarms and neckline have had no change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will, however, note that professional laser treatments take several visits over a 6 month period. I will update my review after 6 months. In the mean time, it only earns 3 stars.</li>
    <li> I RETURNED ITEM BECAUSE IT WAS NOT MEANT FOR BLONDE PEOPLE</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much so I was pleased with the results I did get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve completed about 3-4 treatments all most of the areas I wanted to treat.  Full disclosure, I&#x27;m an ideal candidate for laser or IPL treatment - super pale of northern European decent and very dark hair.  I done professional laser treatments twice.  Once 10+ years ago on my face.  It was fairly sucessful but some hair eventually came back.  I did face again, plus toes, and tops of feet abut 5 years ago.  Much more sucessful the second time around.  Both times I did three plus treatments and spent well over $1,000 total.  I wanted to do more at second place but was scared of the pain.  The tops of my feet hurt like the dickens.  I couldn&#x27;t imagine doing bikini line without screaming at them to stop every other zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Having control is part of what really, really attracted me to IPL even tho I expected it to not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did.  After just one treatment on lower legs, I noticed hair was growing slower and less thick.  Three treatments in, it&#x27;s pretty amazing.  Results ARE uneven.  It strangely works better along the side of my shin bone but the top of my shin bone?  Hair is still growing nearly as thick as always - even though I spend extra time and care zapping that area.  Underarms have been most effective.  The hair hardly grows any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m pleased because I didn&#x27;t expect perfect results.  There is NO WAY the FDA would allow a company to sell a laser for home use because it is WAY TOO DANGEROUS.  I expected this machine to be so under-powered it wouldn&#x27;t do anything.  It&#x27;s not even a laser, just a strong light bulb flash.  But, it&#x27;s stronger than I expected.  Using the IPL, the hairs almost never explode like they do with real laser treatment.  I love the exploding hairs - hurts like crazy but you really feel that you&#x27;ve killed that hair forever.  I think all this device does is stunt the hairs. I&#x27;ll take the stunting.  It&#x27;s worth it to have to shave less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have said, it&#x27;s a pain the cartridges run out so fast.  If I had to do it again, I may have bought the $400 version that has 30,000 flashes per cartrigdes but that&#x27;s not very clear in the description. But, I do think the cartridge claiming 1,500 is more or less accurate.  It&#x27;s still way, way cheaper than professional hair removal of any mode - laser, waxing, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to Add May 3, 2015&lt;br /&gt;So...  I bought a Tria. The Remington is fine but it only goes so far.  The Tria has been much more effective on &amp;#34;mid range&amp;#34; hairs and hair that this thing just had no effect on.  Save yourself some money and just do the Triia first  Tria is more tedious because you only move it a quarter of an inch each time but it it&#x27;s more effective.  So in the long run, worth it.it&#x27;s a pain the cartridges run out so fast.

    <li> I tried on my legs and i feel it works</li>
    <li> I actually bought this on a gamble, leaning more towards it not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 23 year old male Hispanic with tan skin and have always been insecure about my thick leg hairs (Really f***ing thick)so  $200 compared to paying a professional was more than appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I tested it on was my hand and then my stomach, chest and a few days later, my legs. Instead of treating the areas every two weeks, I let it grow out for over a month to see if there was any differences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The booklet did say that the hairs will look as if they are still growing when in fact, they were dead and being pushed out. A lot of them fell out even with slight tugs, but some just kept growing. Turns out that about %50 of the hairs on my legs and stomach were completely unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after a full month, I&#x27;m pretty sure now that the hairs that did fall out are going to stay like that permanently, leaving the treated&lt;br /&gt;areas looking all patchy. I can see and obvious pattern treatments so now I have to retreat it all again to completely get rid of the rest of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting to see hairs actually GROW back and thinner but, that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. It&#x27;s either going to kill the hair permanently or not affected at all. It&#x27;s just hit or miss with some hair strands but, nothing future treatments won&#x27; be able to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to completely get rid of hair, this will work for no doubt. As long as you&#x27;re light skinned and have black hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I found out why it doesn&#x27;t work on darker skin when I treated my calfs, they&#x27;re slightly darker and ended up with light burn marks.&lt;br /&gt;for me, I don&#x27;t mind that it was permanent but now I have to do it again as I can&#x27;t leave the patches  and lines of hairs growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE PICTURES of before and after a month of the first treatment so if you want to see the patchworks,&lt;br /&gt;E-mail me and I&#x27;ll share. That&#x27;s the one thing I didn&#x27;t like when researching is I couldn&#x27;t find any reliable before and afters so I took pics out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand how this thing got so many negative reviews. Thing will leave you bald if you do it like it&#x27;s supposed to be done.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product.. it did not live up to the expectations. i tried returning it but too late.. ahhhh amazon!! -.-</li>
    <li> It can be used as laser gun, pointer, hair burner, etc. but if you are buying this item for hair removal purposes, you are about to waste 200$ plus tax for nothing. Believe me, I used as directed in their handbook for ONE YEAR, there is no change on my hair problem. My hair also grew a lot because you have to shave target area before using this machine.&lt;br /&gt;WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF MONEY, WASTE OF MONEY</li>
    <li> It is just waste of money and time. It stopped flashing and I didn&#x27;t lose any of my hair. I believe all of those positive reviews are just fake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal before (obviously I didn&#x27;t complete the treatments) but wanted a less expensive way to obtaining similar results.  I bought this instead of the Tria system [[ASIN:B0029OSN4U Tria Laser Hair Removal]] for two reasons: 1. the Tria is battery operated and I didn&#x27;t want to deal with replacing (what are probably expensive) batteries, and 2. the Remington was significantly less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this several months ago and then sort of forgot to keep using it.  The directions say to use every two weeks (which is the same frequency of treatment from actual laser hair removal businesses) and it&#x27;s easy to forget.  I recommend setting a calendar reminder to help you remember.  Anyway, I *guess* I saw some hair loss?  I did three full treatments but wasn&#x27;t blow away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(BTW, the original cartridge lasted 3.5 treatments, include legs, bikini, underarm.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe six weeks later I decided to give this another try.  This time I concentrated only on the underarms and bikini because they&#x27;re smaller (and quicker) areas to treat and I thought I would be able to test the effectiveness more efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the results: I&#x27;ve done five or six treatments and am definitely seeing results in the bikini line.  The underarms are okay but not as dramatic as the bikini area.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if I can get near complete hair removal, and I guess we&#x27;ll see how long that lasts.  Just keep with it - it&#x27;s a slower process than professional laser hair removal, and the results are not as stunning, but then again the Remington is a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I get the results I want, I&#x27;ll move on and try this on my legs.  The legs take A LONG TIME because the laser head is pretty small, so we&#x27;ll see if I have the patience.</li>
    <li> Well, I am loving it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having my daughter, I had hormonal imbalances. The hair on my arms got darker and denser.  I developed a highly visible dark patch of hair under my chin.  I have very fair skin but the patch of hair was dark. I was seriously considering the laser treatment but could not trust the providers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, my husband surprised me with this system. I tried it, and noticed a difference after the first treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment the patch is no more and I only have a few hair left standing which will be gone after this treatment...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under chin and Upper lips - utilized the second highest setting&lt;br /&gt;First treatment- improvements&lt;br /&gt;Second treatment -6 days after&lt;br /&gt;Third treatment - 4 days after&lt;br /&gt;Fourth treatment - 4 days after. 95% of the hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under arms - utilized the third highest setting:&lt;br /&gt;Major difference after the first treatment - %60 percent less hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forearms - utilized the third highest setting:&lt;br /&gt;First treatment- improvements&lt;br /&gt;Second treatment -6 days after&lt;br /&gt;Third treatment - 4 days after&lt;br /&gt;70% of the hair is gone. I think I am going to need two more treatment to completely eliminate the hair off my forearms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I successfully eliminate the upper body, I intent to work on my legs and the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. It feels like someone pinches you but totally tolerable. I am so happy that I have found the system. I will be hair free at last; no more painful hot waxing every month!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an olive-skinned, dark haired seasoned bikini waxer who&#x27;s never tried professional laser hair removal due to the fact that it&#x27;s expensive and I&#x27;m a little hairy so I was anxious to try the I-Light Pro.  I read the I-Light Pro directions carefully and viewed the CD before using the unit.  I haven&#x27;t yet completed a full cycle but did see results with the first use.  The instructions are thorough and easy to understand, the unit also has good safety features and is easy to use.  On the downside, the I-Light cartridge that came with the unit died after the second use so I got no where near 1500 pulses or even 500 pulses (luckily I had a replacement cartridge).  The other problem is the I-Light Pro overheats often so you have to wait for it to cool down before starting again.  I didn&#x27;t feel any real pain and can handle the I-Light Pro at its highest level.  Different from waxing, the area covered is only about 1-inch so it takes much longer to complete an area verses waxing.  Plus the I-Light Pro is not designed for semi-genitalia areas or face so I still have to wax those areas separately.  Overall I am happy with my purchase.  Remington is a good company and from what I&#x27;ve seen and read, they fully support their I-Light Pro, and the price was far more reasonable than their competitors.  I&#x27;ll report again after I&#x27;ve concluded a full cycle and how long before I see regrowth.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over six months, started at every two weeks as directed on the underarm and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;While there is definately less hair, there is still shaving required (once a week at least).  I never got to the&lt;br /&gt;point where the hair stopped growing all together and I think I gave it more than a fair chance to work.  (The directions say&lt;br /&gt;you have to use is for a while to catch all the hair folicles in the right growth stage.)&lt;br /&gt;Since I have it I will continue to use it (usually once a week) on those areas since that takes less than 5 minutes and&lt;br /&gt;it does reduce shaving and the bikini line bumps.  If I had the choice though I would not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Since so many people complained about the bulbs burning out I keep track of my zaps with a sticky note inside the&lt;br /&gt;box and I am up to about 800 zaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - Light bulb died today.  I got 1558 flashes out of it. So it did what it promised, can&#x27;t complain about that.  But the cynic in me is wondering if there is some internal counter to make it die after 1500 to generate additional revenue.  Debating whether to order another bulb of just give up on it.</li>
    <li> Not that great.  Gave it away.</li>
    <li> Try several times, the feeling is very good, for the axillary and Bikini effect is very obvious, with some fine hair effect is not obvious, will continue to use, very love</li>
    <li> THESE  AT HOME HAIR  REMOVAL  DEVICES DONT  WORK  WHEN I  BOUGHT THIS ONE. IREMINGTOM  SAID IN 6 WEEKS  THERE WILL BE LESS HAIR THERE ISSENT  NOW  5  CARTRIDGES LATER IT HASENT  CHANGED AT ALL  !!!&lt;br /&gt;I CALL  REMINGTON AND  NOW THEY SAY IT COULD TAKE UP TO 18 MONTHS.. I WANT MY MONEY BACK  FOR THE DEVICE AND THE 5 CARTRIDGES THAT I  BOUGHT ... THINK ABOUT THIS  HOW COULD  SOME THING THAT COST  $200  DO  ANY THING  WHEN IT WOULD COST$ 2000 TO  GET IT DONE  AT  A  LASER HAIR REMOVAL  BUSSINESS..</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I have already saved 10 times over than what I spent on this product in laser treatments. I had very thick black hair on my chin and neck and being a woman it was very embarrasing for me. Though it says dont use it for the face, I had no choice and I am very happy with the results. I have zero hair on my neck and chin now. No more spending time removing the unwanted hair before rushing out and I have even gotten rid of the habit I had of rubbing my hand on my chin to gage the hair regrowth. Anyone who has any thick unwanted dark hair should get this product.....Thanks Remington!</li>
    <li> I have used the hair removal system quite a few times and it does lessen the hair on the under arms and legs. I still must shave at least twice a week though. I am hoping for a more permanent solution with continued use..</li>
    <li> I tried two treatments using the I-Light Pro. The first was on my calves, I waited two weeks and repeated the treatment on my calves again and also did my underarms and thighs as well. Not once did I lose any hair follicles on any of the treated areas. I used the highest setting, which is supposed to be the most painful and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, maybe I got a dud. I really had high hopes for this product and was terrible disappointed with the results.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife for a Christmas present and had to send it back. There was damage to the unit that you could hear, loose parts floating around inside. The system would not start up as advertised, got stuck in a error loop every time. Amazon&#x27;s return policy is five star though. Sent it back and had a credit to my card in two days !!!</li>
    <li> I got this machine last week, so I cannot give you a review on long term results.  I can however tell you that when I first took this machine out of the box, I was VERY impressed with the quality of this unit.  It was not a flimsy, cheap looking machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched this item quite a bit before ordering, so I knew there was an issue about the bulbs not being the greatest(but the reviews of the machine were great and that is why I purchased).  I found that out quickly, when my bulbs didn&#x27;t even last 50 pulses.  I did have a spare however, and found it was very easy to change out, and I did call Remington telling them about their faulty bulb and they offered to replace it quickly without any hassle.  I just have to send the old bulb back in a prepaid envelope they are providing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my uses, I placed my unit on the 4 setting and yes it does hurt, but the benefits are worth it.  As I said earlier, I cannot give you a review on long term results, but I can say it has definitely slowed down the hair growing process for me.  I am one of those bad people that did use it on my face(upper lip) and that is an area that I had to maintain daily(by plucking) and I can say that I can go days at a time and not see anything and if I do see something, and have to pluck, it comes out extremely easily, as if there isn&#x27;t much holding onto it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this unit 5 stars, because I am VERY happy with the result and so far this machine does extactly as it said it would do.  If I would have had the option to give it 4 1/2 stars..I would have to deduct for the bulb issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this machine.  I can use this machine in the convenience of my home and not have to worry about appt.&#x27;s and cost of in office laser hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I originally wrote a good review on this product. However, that was premature and I regret possibly having steered others in the wrong direction. I am a male with fair/light skin and dark brown/black hair. I previously had wonderfully-permanent success with professional laser hair removal on my unibrow. I wanted to give this a try as a more cost-effective solution for other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the unit didn&#x27;t fail to work completely. Yes, it partially worked. I did six treatments each on several parts of my body including chest, arms, hands, feet, groin. I used the highest setting, and doing so is quite painful--albeit worth it had it actually worked. Treatment failed completely on all areas except for my chest/abdomen, where it partially worked. What do I mean by partially? Well, even though each treatment was done identically, apparently one of the treatments decided to actually work (probably had something to do with the growth cycle). Because I didn&#x27;t line up each zap perfectly--impossible to do without serious overlap and, consequently, burn--I was left with a cheetah chest. There are about 24 rectangular patches where little-to-no hair grows now. Everywhere else around it, hair grows fine. If I let my hair grow out, it looks crazy. So now I must shave my chest religiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product and have returned it for a partial refund. The experience I had with this device is 100% negative. I&#x27;m worse off than when I started. Would not wish this on my worst [hairy] enemy.</li>
    <li> The unit has become inoperable after one month usage. The sensor that touches the skin is broken. It always beeps as in not ready to flash mode. I think I will have to purchase a replacement sensor and I have no idea where or how much. I am reviewing the warranty hopefully I can return the product completely.</li>
    <li> I have used this product 6 times since the purchase. Twice on each of the first 3 settings and about every other week and have already had to replace the cartridge once. All I see in results so far is some small smooth patches. I will give it a few more weeks before I can say whether or not I regret spending that much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several weeks now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It doesn&#x27;t pack the punch of a professional system, but I&#x27;ve found that allows me to use it more often.  I use it on my face (with proper eye protection) weekly and have noticed a significant improvement.  I have less hair and what remains is much finer.&lt;br /&gt;another benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t leave me with inflamed pores the way the dermatologist&#x27;s system does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item a few months ago and have used it on average every two weeks like the instructions say. I have probably used it for 8 applications and did go about 3 or 4 weeks between one of them. I am a male and use it on my chest, and shoulders. I have found a little reduction on shoulders, but not much difference on chest. I am on my third cartridge (original and bought two others) so I would have to say that they DO NOT last to 1500 flashes. I will continue using to see if I get better results. I have fair skin and dark hair. My suggestion to Remington, either make the cartridges last longer or reduce the price by 50%  I was hopping for better results, based on the reviews on here. I am a little skeptical on the validity of these reviews, considering how many perfect scores there are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of October 25, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still getting mediocre results from this product. Another thing I just found out about it is that the light bulbs (that are not cheap by any means) don&#x27;t always last the same amount of time. The last one I purchased burned out very quickly, I got about 30% use out of it. So if this continues, I will be lowering my rating to 1 or 2 stars. RIGHT NOW I WOULD SAY 2 1/2 STARS.&lt;br /&gt; Hair re growth seems to be slower and thinner only in some areas and only if you continue to use the product. So if this means this will be never ending then, it will be rather pricey and not convenient at all.</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t claim it is permanent hair removal, and it isn&#x27;t... but it does seem to last longer than shaving.  It takes a long time to do a large area, so I only do small areas now.  The cartridge last about as long as they say, but if you are doing legs it will go pretty quick.  I had ordered another to have on hand.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, and just spend the money on permanent cosmetic lasering.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s gonna happen:  You&#x27;re gonna buy it, you&#x27;re gonna use it a couple times, not enough to really see a difference.  Then you&#x27;re going to misplace it and forgot you ever had it.  So, is it worth this much money?  It might have reduced the total number of follicles on my legs by a bit, but the hair is still coarse and dark...  It takes forever to use because it has such a small treatment area per flash.  Also, I&#x27;d have to stop and clean the window frequently because a hair would melt to it or something and create the smell of burning hair and it would get hotter and hotter...  And this thing really stings, especially in sensitive areas.  So...eh.</li>
    <li> I was not even concerned about having to shave my legs or underarms . . . or even the bikini line. I have - had - dark hair on my arms. It wasn&#x27;t quite man-like, but it was enough to make me self-conscious. I had been using waxing strips for over 15 years. They worked, but I had to do the process about every 2 weeks to keep up with the new growth. It was messy and painful and time-consuming. I don&#x27;t have any kind of hormonal problem, this was just a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; from my parents. I have an olive complexion, tan easily, and my hair was not thick but very dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Remington - I have used this product 3 times in the past 6 months, the most recently about 2 months ago, and there is still almost no hair on my arms. There is some peach fuzz, just enough to look like \\&quot;normal\\&quot; female arms, but I have had no regrowth of the thick dark hair since my first usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With some trepidation I have also used the Remington on my face. I had some dark peach fuzz on my upper lip, nothing too troublesome, and that kind of \\&quot;extended hairline\\&quot; along my jawline and cheeks. I have used the Remington 2 times in the past six months, most recently about 3 months ago - and again I am still pretty much hair free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there is some pain, but nothing compared to feeling so self-conscious and embarrassed! Waxing is also painful, and I had to do that every 2 weeks or so. Using the Remington feels like a snapping rubber band. But once done, I have not had to repeat for over a month - and each time I repeat the results are better and last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t speak to being worried about shaving my legs or underarms or bikini area. That has always seemed like nothing compared to my self-consciousness about my hairy arms and face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 56 years old, so you can imagine my delight at finding something that works so well after so many years of embarrassment and self-consciousness! I have had no problems with the unit working properly, but I did have to change out the laser thingy after my last use. That doesn&#x27;t seem uncalled for, given the fact that I had done both arms 3 times and my face 2 times. It was easy to order, arrived quickly, and was a snap to change out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product for ease of usage and the results. If you don&#x27;t have any kind of hormonal problem, have dark hair, and are looking for a solution for the type of problem I had - then this is what you have been looking for.change out the laser thingy after my last use.

    <li> I have used this item four times following the instructions, no hair anymore. U should shave as clean as possible to achieve a better result, and feel less pain</li>
    <li> I am a pretty hairy guy and I bought this to try to cut back some of my body hair. Honestly I haven&#x27;t used it much. I have had professional laser hair treatment and while not the same, this kind of felt like it. I just haven&#x27;t used it enough to see if it is really working. It seems of high quality though. I will update if I get more into using this.</li>
    <li> 03-16-2014 Just bought this and I have read TONS of reviews. I am smack in the middle of the skin color charts, olive and kind of pale but never white - white in the winter and extremely brown in the summer with very dark hair. I have had professional laser treatments all over and I was getting decent results but I want to save the money and this costs less than one treatment. I hope that people reading these really do thorough research and understand what they are getting into. I saw a post with several dates showing a user&#x27;s experience over time and it was very helpful and more true to the performance of the product (hence my dated entry - there will be more to follow). I had great results when I first got my treatments professionally (more than a year&#x27;s worth of time and money), underarms - immediately 80% gone I have some random fine hairs coming back in now, bikini - probably 10% each time gone but alot has come back with no change in coarseness, legs - 25% immediately and has remained noticeably thinner and very sparse. It&#x27;s been about 8 months since my last professional treatment so lets see how this goes.</li>
    <li> it works i can already see the results yeah..i have started using this product a few weeks ago and i  am pleased with the results,especially considering all of the hair i started with on my chin.i have spent lots of money on lazor treatments and electrolosis over the years.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my spouse 12/25/2012 - part of the deal is that I also administer the treatment - we&#x27;re 60+ minutes from a skin center, so this seemed like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works as advertised - my spouse is fair-skinned and has dark folicles, so she&#x27;s perfect for this unit.  However, there are some considerations with this product that make it a pain in the tookus... I&#x27;ll assume you&#x27;ve read the other 387 reviews and try to skip repeats ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most Important / Best Tip:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put in a new cartridge refill and zap until it gives out - otherwise you won&#x27;t get your $$$ worth from this thing.  If you turn it off, or go for 1/2 sessions, the refill cartridge often won&#x27;t &amp;#34;accept your skin type,&amp;#34; and you have to put in a new $18.00 refill to get going...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Every time you fire it up, you have to &#x27;verify&#x27; that you are the proper skin type by holding it to your skin &amp; hoping / praying that it decides to accept your skin, even though it worked just fine right before you took a break to get another ice bag ... if it decides you aren&#x27;t the person you were just 10 minutes ago, the only resolution is to insert another $18.00 laser refill.  I think it&#x27;s .... odd at best that the refill just happens to punk-out after a session, and rarely during a session (we&#x27;ve only had one refill quit mid-session)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*By our accounting, you get a certain number of pulses - give or take - depending on whether you screwed up and turned the thing off for a while - before you have to replace the bulb.  It does not seem to matter what level of intensity the thing is on, so your best bet is to suffer &amp; fry yourself.  Ice packs are your friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Every time you turn the thing on, it starts at the lowest possible / least effective setting.  I&#x27;ve gotten halfway through a treatment and realized &amp;#34;@#$%^&amp; - it&#x27;s on LOW!&amp;#34; and had to go back and do it again (NOT popular with the spouse, BTW..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*A waist - down treatment takes quite some time - as in 2-3 hours, as the window is the size of 1/2 of a postage stamp.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone does this to themselves without going blind - I have to move the unit, squeeze my eyes shut, &amp; hit &#x27;fire,&#x27; and I still see spots for an hour afterwards...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I&#x27;m not sure how to phrase this appropriately, so read carefully .... my lady does not like getting shot with a laser a few hundred times, but after the treatment, she&#x27;s .... sparkier than usual?  Out of curiosity, I had her do my shoulders, and I can say that getting shot with a laser over and over for some reason has a ... heightening effect on the &#x27;ol libido.  Sounds great, right?  Well, unfortunately, after shooting my lady with a laser a few hundred times, and physically inspecting every square half-centimeter of her body for hair-folicles, and bombing my retinas with second-hand laser light again and again (sunglasses don&#x27;t work, as you can&#x27;t see with &#x27;em on to operate the darn thing, so you have to just squeeze your eyes shut) ... well, after all that I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m particularly &amp;#34;in the mood,&amp;#34; and the same seemed to be the case when she was zapping me... go figure.  So be prepared to either suppress your urges or take one for the team, depending on whether you&#x27;re Han Solo or Princess Leia ....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all.  Have now done the process 3X and am waiting to see if there are any results.</li>
    <li> My back has thick, black hair. I bought this and have been using it from past 2 + months. I have noticed 70 % + reduction in hair. I use it every other week . I am East Indian and i have light brown skin. So results will vary based on your skin color.</li>
    <li> Started this with complete faith in the product and optimistic about the results.  Read and watched all the instructions, followed them to the letter and after three full treatments on full power, and having had to replace a cartridge already, I haven&#x27;t seen any indications that it has worked at all.  Bummer.</li>
    <li> I have only had it a little while and already it has made my hair lighter, not as thick, and grow slower.</li>
    <li> I never tried this hair removal device. i read the instructions, watched the included DVD, and felt the effort was too much. It is a long process that one needs to commit to. The individual applying this device has to be thorough or they can miss areas. The system seemed like too much trouble for my needs.</li>
    <li> I was a little sad to see I have to wait 6 weeks to begin using it! I was an epilator until this point. I did have one session on my underarms where epilation was too painful. Definitely less painful then epilation!! Will have to update after I get a few more sessions in!</li>
    <li> It works really, really well. Treatments are quick and don&#x27;t hurt (shave the area you&#x27;re using it on first for best results). If you&#x27;re sick of the time and money spent on shaving with a razor, you&#x27;ll be *very* happy you found this.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work very well at all.  Even after following the directions exactly, this thing doesn&#x27;t prevent hair from reoccurring within 2 days.  It was a complete waste of money.  Stick to Nair, electrolysis, shaving, or waxing people!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 5 weeks, used about 500 (following the weekly usage recommendation) flashes and the bulb needs to be replaced.  I have had professional laser hair removal with good results, so far this unit isn&#x27;t as effective and replacing the bulb so soon is a bummer.  I&#x27;ll try ordering the new bulb but not ready to recommend this product yet.</li>
    <li> I received this a few weeks ago, so far I have done a few treatments with it, I have opted to go with the lower intensity during treatments in order to keep discomfort and rashes/irritations to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;As I am sure that most of you have read, results will not be immediately apparent, however, there does seem to be a change in two out of three areas that I am treating, the third area has thick stubborn hair so I expect it to take longer than the other two.  On the areas with the somewhat thinner hair it seems that already there is a reduction of hair so that&#x27;s very encouraging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On preparing the area, it is best to shave the area and make sure it is nice and dry, why?&lt;br /&gt;1) even on the lowest setting the pulse puts out quite a bit of energy, wet skin would result in burns because of the heating up of the remaining water.&lt;br /&gt;2) any hairs left will a-absorb energy that you really want to go in the follicle, and b-result in a burned hair smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the unit itself is concerned I had no issues with it what so ever, everything worked and still does.</li>
    <li> I purchased the i-Light Pro in March 2014.  I used it on my underarms and bikini area first, as these were the areas I was most interested in NOT SHAVING anymore.  I read (and mostly followed) the instructions.  I determined I was a good candidate for the laser to work well -- dark hair with medium/olive complexion.  The product is easy to use.  It did smart a little more than I expected at first, but you do get used to it.  Just like the instructions said, I saw the first signs of results about 2 weeks after my first use.  I&#x27;ve used it about 4 times over 6 weeks on my underarms and they are 95% hair-free!  yeah!  I&#x27;m just touching up areas that I missed now.  My bikini line is about 85% hair free and has required a few more touch-ups, but this could be because that area is more sensitive and I had to use a lower setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big question is how long these results will last.  I had really hoped the results would be permanent, but the product does not make that promise.  (It says &amp;#34;up to 6 monthhs&amp;#34;.)  Another reviewer confirmed the 6 month figure before re-treatment was required.  If that turns out to be accurate, I&#x27;ll be happy to have had a hair-free summer and will re-treat in the fall.  The treatments are quick on smaller areas like I&#x27;ve been doing -- 10 to 15 minutes max.  Larger areas take longer, obviously, and are trickier to make sure you&#x27;ve covered adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any of the technical problems some reviewers reported.  I&#x27;m still using the original bulb and it&#x27;s firing just fine.  I have not been good about keeping track of the number of flashes, however, so will rely on the machine to tell me when it&#x27;s nearing the end of it&#x27;s life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and the results because a) the price is very reasonable compared to laser hair removal in a salon; b) I control the machine and my comfort level, avoiding the risk of severe burns/scars which can happen with salon treatments; and c) the results have been what I hoped for.  If you are a good candidate and have enough patience to wait two weeks to see results, you will be happy with this product.sults have been what I hoped for.  If you are a good candidate and have enough patience to wait two weeks to see results, you will be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> ITS just that,, ok.. nothing else.. it prommisse results that are fake, it helps to reduce the growing hair but it doesnt dissapear its at all.!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a gift. She has used it a few times and is noticing a difference. She said the hair is coming back thinner after every use. I would recommend this to buy.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I&#x27;ve had professional laser hair removal and purchased this product much more as a spot reducer than to really do hair removal on my entire body.  The product is study,  well-made, and easy to use.  Why I would NOT recommend this product to anyone is that it does not emit the advertised 1,500 pulses per cartridge.  I use it merely for single or few hairs on a few body parts and have gone through numerous cartridges when if the advertised number of pulses were true I would hypothetically still be on my first cartridge.  At 25 dollars a pop for the cartridge it&#x27;s no longer an economically beneficial product and I&#x27;d suggest that anyone debating getting laser hair removal would be better off looking for a professional.  Nothing irks me more than blatant false advertising and there is no way Remington does not know that the cartridge doesn&#x27;t last 1,500 pulses.  It&#x27;s essentially part of their marketing plan,  to get you to buy the system and then rely on the revenue generated from the cartridges over the course of time....Sleazy</li>
    <li> Takes too long. Tip is tiny.</li>
    <li> Makes hair grown back less and less and finer. Have to keep buying cartridge refills but it is way less expensive than laser hair removal at an office.</li>
    <li> The hair keeps growing back. Even though I used maximum laser strength and I did it more than 3 times. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I received the I-Light on May 1, 2012, to high expectations. I&#x27;m sorry to say that I have been sorely disappointed. I had been waxing for about a year before I tried this system. I wanted to stop waxing due to the horrible ingrown hairs I would get in my bikini area. I hoped that since my hair follicles were already weakened that I would have good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that I am a very fair skinned woman with dark hair. I used the I-Light every 2 weeks per the directions. I also only used the device on the highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 treatments I started noticing patchy spots on my legs and bikini area, and was encouraged that the device actually worked, so I kept at it instead of returning. However, after 7 total treatments, the patchiness in my bikini area grew back and the small patches on my legs are mostly still there - but they are SMALL, I still have to shave. The other issue - I still get ingrown hairs! They aren&#x27;t as bad as when I waxed, but they&#x27;re still there and still in abundance. I use Bikini Zone which helps, but nothing makes them go away. In addition, there is little to no difference in the reduction of hair on my bikini line. I seriously might as well go back to shaving - I get the same results, ingrown hairs and it all grows back! As for the review(s) which said to use an epilator to remove the hair because they are all dead - HA! Not mine; let me reassure you that 99% of the hair in the treated areas (bikini, legs, underarms) is 100% fully intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other frustration deals with the bulbs. I&#x27;ve had to exchange several now because they didn&#x27;t last past one treatment, or even 1 treatment. I&#x27;ve gotten probably 2 good bulbs out of maybe 5 total. That makes me question the quality of the product as a whole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the skin sensor (the one that allows the unit to be used if you have the correct skin tone) is a joke. When I first got the product it scanned my skin and started right up. Now it takes 3-4 times of letting it scan my forearm before the device will turn on. Nothing has changed with my skin tone.times of letting it scan my forearm before the device will turn on. Nothing has changed with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> But it says not to use on your face and that&#x27;s the only place it works. Been using it for months now and still shaving.</li>
    <li> OK, so I know that there is no permanent hair removal system out there but I went ahead and bought this to see if it would be more convenient than salon waxing. I had to buy an electric shaver as well, so add that to the initial cost outlay. As it turns out, the head of the IPL device is very small and it takes me a LONG time to do any reasonable portion of my legs....which means that the cartridge runs out pretty quickly and needs to be replaced so I&#x27;m not even sure about cost savings. This thing is just as painful as a wax btw. One good thing is that I no longer get in-grown hairs like I did from waxing. Other than that, I really need to FIND the TIME to give this device a proper try....and that is NOT very convenient to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this item about 6 months ago; however, it has stopped working properly. I have only used it about six times. I cannot find who to contact about this problem, but I am very dissatisfied with the lifespan of this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now and have not really noticed any significant difference. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I have noticed that I dont sweat as much as I used to since using this product. Random, I have no idea why that is. So it doesnt really work for the hair removal for me but it does have one good thing about it. Again, this is just something i noticed and could have better results for someone else.</li>
    <li> A good product that works, not as well as a laser, but has a good size head that makes use easier. Cost of replacement heads is rather high.</li>
    <li> Seems easy enough to use although it took a few minutes to setup and actually use it. We&#x27;ll see about the hair removal. There is no need to shave the hair although you may want to as when I first used it, you could smell burning hair. :-) Update: I don&#x27;t really see any improvement on the hair removal over just plain tweezers. It&#x27;s a lot of money for a gadget that only works so-so.</li>
    <li> I bought this on 8/12 and already need a new cartridge on 9/4. I only use it on my face.  So I give 3 stars. This is unexpected  and inconvenient. I know that it is not advertised as safe for your face, but it is the only thing that I have found helpful in 20 years for facial hair.  - so it&#x27;s  a success as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I cant imagine using on your legs or tenders.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really work on keeping hair removed.</li>
    <li> This product definitely works.  When u first use it it definitely stings but after a couple of uses doesn&#x27;t sting at all as hair is less.  Do not flash the light on the same place twice thinking that it will kill hairs faster, I did this and burned myself ..ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says use every 3 months ...well I used it every other day for the first week.  If hair grew back I used it again and I have been using it 3 months and virtually hair free and honestly I had a lot of hair.  I used to shave my legs every day and now once very two weeks although u really can&#x27;t see any hair coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons, it will not work on grey hair or blonde hair at all, although it tells u that it won&#x27;t work on blonde or grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says you can use on bikini ...well I gave myself full Brazilian with this and love the smoothness.  I had laser before and the hair grew back thick as it was, with this machine , it definitely kills the hair follicle. It is not recommended to do full Brazilian but take no notice ...turn it to setting one first two times ..ouch but doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as wax...and third time turn it up ..it works and ur privates will be smooth as silk, and it won&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also says you can&#x27;t use on face...let me tell you it works on brown spots, melisma ...mine have virtually gone and works on wrinkles erasing fine wrinkles.  Even my hubby is using it under his eyes.  Not recommended by the manufacturer but I have pushed this machine to its limits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I have bought at least two bulbs a week which are pretty expensive.  I now write down how many flashes I use and call Remington if a bulb is faulty.  They send me prepaid postage and replace bulb immediately.  I will say I have had to return 1 in 3 bulbs, but for the results that I have experienced and their fantastic customer service it is absolutely worthwhile the inconvenience.  The results are much better than any med spa salon and way cheaper.  I recieved it as a gift that I asked for ..but if this machine cost $1000k it would still be worth it.  Another reason to write down flashes it that 1500 flashes goes really fast once you get used to using the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long review, but answering all the questions I had about the product and. Couldn&#x27;t find.  If you use it like I do, you will be virtually hair free in a month.d for ..but if this machine cost $1000k it would still be worth it.

    <li> I think you can get a more effective laser hair treatment with a professional. This unit (as all are consumer units for laser hair removal) is designed to be fool proof, and safe for consumers who can....be less than adept with using a laser powered product. As such, to get anywhere with this product you have to ignore the guidelines a bit. I don&#x27;t know why there are 5 power levels - I think Marketing made that requirement. Always max it out - especially since you only get 1500 light pulses per cartridge. I think the cartridges are much more powerful when you initially start using them, so over time you will probably use more pulses for an area and still have a sub par experience. The good news is the cartridges are relatively inexpensive compared to similar products from competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I knocked some stars off. Despite continued use, the hair keeps coming back. The hair is much, much finer, but it&#x27;s all still there. I recently went to a professional for my neck line, and if the pain levels are any indication of what an effective treatment is like, it&#x27;s the equivalent of 5-6 pulses from this device on the same area. After 1 professional treatment, over 80% of my hair did not grow back in 6 weeks time. So when all is said and done, get yourself a laser hair removal deal from Yelp. It might cost a little more, but your time and effort will be worth something in the end if a professional does it.</li>
    <li> does not clear all the hair but the total amount is much less than before, and the new growned ones are softer than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;updated: this thing has a major flaw, after a few month use, you can not use it for over continue 10 flash a time, it need rest at least 6 hours before next 10 flash. If you have big area to deal with, it&#x27;s not good at all.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful system.&lt;br /&gt; It does just what it says it will do. I have had to remove my hair every day for years. Now that I have used this system 3 times in a Month my hair  is starting to come in slower, I haven&#x27;t had to shave my legs this week at all.  I got the goggles also ,but don&#x27;t waste your money on them.You really don&#x27;t need them.</li>
    <li> I got it mainly for my face (I know, le gasp, I&#x27;m just bad to the bone, such a rule breaker!) even though it says not to use the ILight on your face. I&#x27;m a woman with super light skin and dark hair and I got sick of plucking in the morning, not to mention the peach fuzz which seemed to be getting thicker and darker by the day, and so I decided to laugh in the face of danger, bought it anyway, and it is probably the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a while. I do use the red (incredibly nerdy) laser-glasses things, but then I have sensitive eyes and I use them any time I use this machine, no matter where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The break-down of how I use/used it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually took me a bit before I worked up the courage to actually use the ILight, because I was convinced it would HURT! But, to be honest, it really doesn&#x27;t (even on my face!). The one rule I do follow is I shave right before using it and I have little to no pain after. Sure, I always manage to miss a spot or five when shaving and those areas are painful – for about three seconds – but on the whole it is pain free, and I&#x27;m on #5! Obviously, that will be different for every person, but I think that if you&#x27;ve ever gotten a wax or even nicked yourself shaving you’ll probably find this less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the first week I used it every day on my face (beard/mustache area) because I was super frustrated, breaking out from the fuzz, had bumps from plucking, etc., and wanted to be very aggressive. I was just done with the awkward facial hair and willing to take the risk. The next week I used it basically every other day, and now I just use it two/three times a week – or whenever I have time or remember. I&#x27;m not regimented about it. This is the first thing that&#x27;s worked for my facial hair and it&#x27;s BRILLIANT. There is so much less hair it’s unreal – and in some areas, areas I’ve been plucking for years (like, there was a lot of hair there), the hair is totally gone! That alone is worth the price of the ILight and the cartridges for me, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a woman like me dealing with this, know that it works and that others are going through/have gone through what you are. (I was at my wits end when I stumbled on this and wanted to know the above info when I was reading reviews, so that&#x27;s why I included so much info. I hope it helps you, if you&#x27;re looking for something, anything that works, like I was.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, caveat emptor: Remington flat out says don&#x27;t use it on your face. That’s a choice you’ll have to make for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, moving on to the rest, because you can bet that for the money I spent I&#x27;m using it everywhere... it&#x27;s great. I haven&#x27;t been as aggressive with my body hair as with my facial hair (because, God, who has the patience!) but it&#x27;s really working, just slower. I use it about once a week (maybe once every two weeks if I&#x27;m busy) and the hair is really going away. Less hair grows back and a lot of the hair just falls out when I lightly tug on it, which is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, in case it wasn’t glaringly obvious yet, I’m a big fan. I’m super grateful I stumbled on this and actually got it. For me, it’s a life saver. Good luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Remington’s customer service is STELLAR! If you have any issue they are there for you. Their customer service reps are incredibly nice and lovely to deal with – which is basically just gilding the lily!</li>
    <li> I rarely have to shave now with this unit. I only use lower level since it&#x27;s uncomfortable at the higher level.</li>
    <li> My wife loved this as a gift</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start out by saying I&#x27;m the ideal candidate for laser hair removal. I&#x27;m pale with thick dark hair. Plus I have sensitive skin. So every time I would shave, I&#x27;d get razor burn and ingrown hairs. Fun times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE HAD PROFESSIONAL LASER HAIR REMOVAL BEFORE AND YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT TO REALISTICALLY EXPECT. You WILL have to shave! This doesn&#x27;t remove your hair permanently. Nothing will! I have noticed results. I&#x27;m happy just because I don&#x27;t have razor burn anymore, so maybe my expectations were pretty low to begin with. The hair seems thinner, which in turn, prevents horrible irritation when shaving and it looks lighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always put the setting on 5, because I feel like anything lower would be a huge waste of time and money. Although I&#x27;m not sure it does much on any setting. I had much better results with professional laser hair removal- they have a better, more effective machine. When you go for a professional treatment- you can feel, see, and smell it working, so I was disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;tell\\&quot; the Remington I-light Pro home unit was working at the time of use. But I kept using it, as directed, because I figured it HAD to be doing SOMETHING, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I&#x27;ve noticed:&lt;br /&gt;No more razor burn&lt;br /&gt;No more ingrown hairs/ hairs that grow just below the surface&lt;br /&gt;Finer, thinner hair&lt;br /&gt;Slightly less sparse hair growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that may burst your bubble:&lt;br /&gt;You will still have to shave&lt;br /&gt;You will not be hairless, hair grows at the same pace, so you&#x27;ll still be stubbly the next day&lt;br /&gt;It feels hot against your skin and occasionally hurts (but hopefully that means it&#x27;s doing something right? No pain, no gain)&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges add up and ultimately you have to determine if the results are worth the price&lt;br /&gt;Professional laser hair removal is more effective&lt;br /&gt;Time consuming, the window is incredibly small&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s up to you to determine whether or not it will work for you and the results will be worth the time, effort, pain, and money.lts will be worth the time, effort, pain, and money.</li>
    <li> I am generally happy with this product. The area I treated is small and I have repeated the treatment about 4 times now. 40% of the hair is gone. I&#x27;m still hoping the remaining hair will fall out with further treatments.</li>
    <li> Ok, device it self works great, I was loving it. I&#x27;m not hairy but wanted to clean up bikini area. It&#x27;s almost gone besides few missed hair here and there and when trying to finish up, bulb died. Like I said in the beginning, I didn&#x27;t treat full body. It&#x27;s clear it does NOT last 1500 flashes...(more like...500 or so). It&#x27;s not expensive but how many bulb will I need? That might add up.</li>
    <li> I know someone who hasn&#x27;t had problems with hair will not understand this but here I go.  This product has changed my life by changing one of my biggest insecurities, my facial hair! I have had a BEARD that I have hidden for almost a decade! I spent HOURS of my life pulling hairs, almost endlessly at night with tweazers, shaving, and waxing the dark hairs.  I never let people touch my face. I felt uncomfortable leaning my head back, or being in natural light with out my makeup on my face.  Oh! And I had six rounds of laser hair removal, with no results.  So I felt that even though I take very good care of my outward appearance I may just have to deal with the hairs, ingrown hairs, and embarassment for the rest of my life.  Then I stumbled upon at home ipl.  I scoured reviews to decide which to purchase, and even though this \\&quot;isn&#x27;t for facial hair\\&quot; my research determined this would be no different than the others as far as safety was concerned.  Ok, so first use, yuck. My hairs felt thicker! Worse than ever! But I had researched enough to know this was a good thing! So I kept shaving and I did it every other day.  Look, I know this was against the directions but I am hair free.  I did that for two weeks. Then once a week. Then once a month.  And my face has never been smoother! I am still on the first cartridge. I don&#x27;t have and dark shaddow on my face anymore. I feel ultra feminine. I can tilt my head back and laugh! So bottom line if you&#x27;re still reading this and you are dealing with my old problem, go for it.</li>
    <li> My fiance loves it! Three treatments and she hasn&#x27;t had to shave in 2 weeks and counting</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift as I was saving for it which was quite nice.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not worth the cost.  I got it off the Target website because with the purchase I got a $50 gift card which paid for two extra light cartridges.  I read the manual fully and followed it to the letter.  I have VERY fair skin and dark hair.  But this still showed hardly any results at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased (I think) 8 cartridges total, including the two I got with the giftcard.  That&#x27;s an extra two hundred dollars spent on this in addition to the price of the machine itself.  And as a result all I have is some hair growing back slightly slower and with the hairs themselves somewhat thinner.  There was absolutely no change at all to my underarms or bikini line, hardly any change to my calves.  To make matters worse, the cartridges don&#x27;t last anywhere near as long as they&#x27;re supposed to.  They&#x27;re supposed to last around 1,500 flashes.  I counted for four sessions and averaged and mine were lucky to last six hundred flashes.  This is a complete and total rip off and false advertisement in my opinion.  It can&#x27;t even be just a fluke with one bulb considering all of mine have lasted such a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So out of the 8 cartridges I got maybe 12 treatments(And they weren&#x27;t ones where I was careful to cover every inch of skin) and now this item is basically a very expensive decoration sitting in the corner because I got tired of pumping $25 into it every session just to get no results.  After writing this review I do plan to write to Remington directly and complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, instead of buying this I&#x27;d suggest simply going to a professional for laser treatments.  I know I wish I had.  Even if they are more expensive at least I would have had SOMETHING to show for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Oh, and this was running the machine on the highest setting too.  So sadly it&#x27;s not even a case of I couldn&#x27;t stand having it turned all the way up.  Max power, I&#x27;m the ideal candidate for this to work on, and still I got no benefits from it.)ate for this to work on, and still I got no benefits from it.)</li>
    <li> Lots of rules and warnings on this product. As well as restrictions on the use by skin color, as well as the color of the hair to be removed.  This product is just not for me.</li>
    <li> First I have to say there is probably a reason why professional  laser hair removal cost thousands of dollars and this device is only 250$. You can not expect too much. Maybe you have shaved for many years you might see results in a month. But I have epilated and waxed all my life ( with very few exceptions) my hair is still pretty dark but not so thick. Still the bikini area is very dark and thick and my skin there is super fair so after speaking to a few friends who have done laser treatments and one who works with professional laser  I was assured by them that if that laser works I should have seen at east 20% of dying hair in the bikini area and I have not seen a single dying hair so far. I have shaved 3 times done 3 treatments a week apart-first one on the second setting, second and third on the highest setting. The bulb indicator went on at the end of third treatment-I have done no more than 300 flashes. As I said I see absolutely no dying hair follicles, the hair keep growing darker and thicker( due to the 3 shavings) and at this point I am not willing to jeopardize the many years of waxing with continuous shaving and zero result from this device. If it worked it would have saved a lot money and time but my guess is the strength of this laser  is way below what professional devices can offer. Best of luck if you decide to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/ 2014&lt;br /&gt;I finally got a groupon for professional laser treatment for my bikini area. After only one treatment so far almost half of the hair got pushed out and fell just like it is described in the Remington manual although i never actually saw it happen with my 3 treatments. I am absolutely amazed. Not to mention how many times more pleasant the professional laser is-the Remington had this zapping feeling that was certainly very unpleasant in sensitive areas. Once again save your money and get a professional treatment instead of this piece of crap if you want to see actual results.</li>
    <li> I bought this system last year and used it do my stomach (around 100 pulses maybe...maybe) and then put it back in the box. Well I finally got around to buying some Lidocain skin number so I could turn up the strength only to find out that after maybe 100 pulses, the bulb is now bad. You got to joking. It&#x27;s supposed to last around 1500, I could understand if it failed at 1400 or even 1300 but after just 100??? That&#x27;s a joke. I&#x27;m highly, highly dissatisfied with this system.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Had my doubts and waited the full month.  By time for the third treatment 95% of the hair was gone and I just needed to do touchups.  Fantastic product at a great price.</li>
    <li> worked fine for 8 months , I was happy with the results, however, after 8 months of light use - the device sopped working all together...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After contacting customer service Remington had sent me a new one with no questions asked.</li>
    <li> Handy and functional, unexpensive hair removal at your home!</li>
    <li> Do not use it for face, as it is said on the manual, useful for legs and hips, but take a lot of time to cover an area</li>
    <li> It is working well so far. I am on my 2nd time using it and I can see my hair growing slow and missing on some parts.&lt;br /&gt;But I am waiting for more resuts.&lt;br /&gt;I am trying to control how many flashes I am using, after that I saw some people saying that it doesn&#x27;t have 1.500 as it says. Everything is working well so far.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really works ! just try it more than  once a week</li>
    <li> I would say it kind of works. People need to remember that the system pushes out the hair after it dies... it doesn&#x27;t just fall out, and because hair grows in stages, not every hair [under your arm or on your leg] is actively growing at once. It may seem so, but it&#x27;s not. So the 6 week treatment plan is there to make sure it gets all the hair no matter the cycle. And honestly, I&#x27;d give it more like 8+ weeks. People that constantly shave seem to forget just how LONG this hair is. Remember, it&#x27;s being pushed out, and the hair is what - probably 2 inches long or so under your arms if you let it grow, right? That would take a while. I, myself do not have perfectly taut skin, and due to the nature of the product, it&#x27;s difficult to get the light where it needs to be (plus, it&#x27;s pretty easy to miss spots!). Where my skin is taut it works great. Where it&#x27;s not, my hair is still growing or being pushed out, I&#x27;m not sure which. But, it is lighter and softer than before. Shaving under my arms takes like 10 seconds. Is it worth 200+? Eh. I guess it depends on how much your abhor shaving. And yeah, it can also be kind of painful, but I think that part is worth it.</li>
    <li> I used it as it said in the booklet... and I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair going away.. I have dark hair and light skin so I should be a perfect candidate for this.</li>
    <li> I was very suspicious that this machine would not work.  I was afraid that reviews were planted.  I was concerned that FDA &amp;#34;cleared&amp;#34; instead of FDA &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34; was a trick.&lt;br /&gt;Well I am thrilled with the results.  You have to look at it as hair reduction, not elimination.  It significantly stuns and halts the growth of hair.  No system is permanent.  I used to have to shave my legs everyday.  I found it very frustrating to have stubble the day after I shaved my legs.  Now I don&#x27;t see any hair for at least 5-7 days and that is after only 3 treatments.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is in various growth cycles, so you have to expect some areas to be uneven.  But with each treatment, I found more uniformity.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my sister one.  You just can&#x27;t beat being able to do this in the privacy of your own home.  And the replacement lights are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I paid $7,500 for a package at a laser center about 5 years ago and I have not even went 10 times since I got it because I hated everything about going from a stranger seeing me nude to the unbearable pain and extreme cold in the rooms. They have so many rules now if you miss so many appointments they won&#x27;t make appointments for you anymore even though I paid in full for the package which is bull and a huge rip off. I got this and I saw results I kid you not, from the first use on my face and neck, WOW. I used to shave my face and neck every day and half but now it&#x27;s every 4 to 5 days and it&#x27;s only the cycling hairs which means there&#x27;s definitely results. Pain levels are okay and of course you can adjust it how you like. I didn&#x27;t buy the goggles and I don&#x27;t see a need for them but everybody has their own preference. I let my sister and 2 friends use it but they have to buy their own heads because they&#x27;re not using the zaps on my head lol. Best investment and I did a lot of research before I bought it and this beats the other machines out there for hair removal, you do the comparisons yourself and you&#x27;ll agree only if you want to use it on your face but if you&#x27;re not doing your face then you can consider the other two competitors, sorry I forgot what they are called lol.  Of course, do not get this if your skin is darker because it won&#x27;t even turn on to zap, it tests your skin color first to make sure it works for you so it make sure it&#x27;s for your skin type or else it won&#x27;t work or you&#x27;ll burn your skin badly. I love it and very proud of myself for making this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I love love love this machine!!! I have suffered from hirtutism for multiple years, I have started and stopped going to the professionals for hair laser treatment (as it was to expensive for me). I finally, and after much research, bought the Remington IPL light machine. I have used it for two months now, and I am proud to say you can hardly see any reminants of once was  dark patches with black thick hairs. I am soo happy with this product that i am telling everyone!! I even told my doctor so that he could let other patients of this product know. I feel soo good about how i look now, i can even go with out the concealer if needed!!.</li>
    <li> Still awaiting the results, but I do suggest buying extra cartridges. The one it came with lasted me one session plus a calf. I ordered the replacements on amazon and they came within 3days but it would&#x27;ve been nice to complete the second session when I had planned. Will update when I see results, but for now I am noticing fewer hairs. :)</li>
    <li> Dont buy this. Its a rip off. Just buy facial razors for womens hair</li>
    <li> Works  great! Wish I would  have bought it sooner.</li>
    <li> I bought this product last summer and Lieu of going to a professional. I did not use it every two weeks as suggested, but basically whenever I remembered to use it. I was not that impressed with the results. Maybe about 30% less hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With spring break approaching I decided a few weeks ago to try again to get my money&#x27;s worth out of it.  This time I have used it every 2 weeks exactly on my underarms and have noticed much better results.  I think it has to do with your hair cycle.  I won&#x27;t be hair free in 3 treatments as promised buy possibly in 6 or 7.  I think it was worth the money and its very convenient to use it in my own home.</li>
    <li> Just did my second treatment and already I notice a HUGE difference in hair growth! Some areas of the body are a little more tender than others....it feels like a \\&quot;zap!\\&quot; so don&#x27;t turn the system up until you have tested it. Awesome product &lt;3</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions exactly as described.. Six month after first treatment (that is 1st week, 3rd week and 5th week), hair reduction is more than 60%. I am starting my second treatment. Used 2 cartridges for 1st treatment (3 times full leg, bikini line and underarms). I recommend to follow instructions exactly as described in the user manual and have at least 1 spare cartridge so you do not have to wait for it during your treatment.</li>
    <li> This is really a great product. Does just what it says it will. Need more time to do my whole leg, eventually.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the I-Light Pro every week like it recommends. However, the few times I have used it have reduced the amount of hair regrowth in my bikini line and underarms! The hair is more sparse, and takes longer to grow back. I will continue using it and update my review in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for now, to discuss how it works, it turns on and is ready for the &amp;#34;Skin tone check&amp;#34; quickly. You just place it on the part of the skin you plan to &#x27;zap&#x27; and cover the little opening on the base to check that the skin tone in that area is acceptable. Then you can start zapping away. There is a small delay in between flashes while it recharges for the next zap. Also, I highly recommend trimming the hair as short as possible or shaving as close as possible before working on an area. Otherwise, to me, it feels like you feel the zap more if you don&#x27;t and you get that awful smell of burnt hair, on top of the fact that it gets the little glass face dirtier if you don&#x27;t shave or trim first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly strong tolerance for pain, and the flashes around my bikini area make me jump and cringe at the next one. So you do feel it. And this was only on the second strongest setting. I&#x27;m not sure how others crank this puppy up to high and use it on sensitive areas! But it would get the job done faster. &#x3D;o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though this isn&#x27;t approved for the face, I have used it on my upper lip. It is a tight fit, and not easy to make sure you get really close to the lip area. However, it worked great there! The still hasn&#x27;t grown back in over a month. I have a medium skin tone, and I didn&#x27;t have any issues at all on any of the places I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, as it has reduced the hair growth, even though it hasn&#x27;t fully eliminated my need for shaving. I will continue using it and look forward to getting more long term results. It is definitely cheaper than going to 6-8 sessions at a professional laser hair removal place! And you can do it in the comfort of your home and whenever you have 10-15 minutes of free time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. Being a fairly hairy man I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this product. The areas where I use it are too sensitive for waxing. Waxing and sugaring just tear up my skin for a couple weeks after. Nair burns the sensitive areas, and the hair grows back soon anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not been using as often as I could, but the results are still impressive. Armpit hair is practically gone. What little pubic hair  remains is VERY slow growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good quality product that works as described!!</li>
    <li> doesnt work.. end of story... bye-bye</li>
    <li> worked, then didn&#x27;t work--hair and mechanically.  customer service was good but in the end--just isn&#x27;t powerful enough to remove hair the way the professional lasers do, kind of obvious.  I gave it a shot.  I was pretty pleased at first but if you&#x27;re anything like me and don&#x27;t have the patience to forever &amp;#34;laser&amp;#34; yourself for a maintenance that winds up being very spotty---go to the professionals.  you wind up spending the same amount of money honestly.</li>
    <li> I been using this for a month now. It has been working for me. I only use this on my face on setting five like every other day for 3 weeks n i have no hair on my face anymore. im only using this once or twice a week now. Its amazing, if u want to use it on ur dark facial hair. Only bad thing is it makes ur skin super dry for the first two weeks so use a good moisturizer after using this. I think only setting five works for ur face. Hope this review  helps.</li>
    <li> I like having a smooth leg, but shaving is such a chore. However, it is the best method of hair removal I&#x27;ve found so far. Waxing just doesn&#x27;t seem practical to me - you have to grow the hair out to have it pulled out and then it only lasts 2 weeks? Um, no. If I am going through all that, the hair removal better last at least twice as long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some other hair removal methods - electric shavers and the like, but nothing gets my legs quite as smooth as shaving. I bought a [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] once, but it was way too painful to me, so I gave it to my Mother, who loved hers. She had wanted an extra one to keep on the RV anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always said if I won the lottery I&#x27;d have laser hair removal on my legs, under my arms, and on the bikini area. Then I found out that Remington makes a home version of what the doctors use and their kit is much more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited when my Remington IPL6000USA I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System arrived. I had planned to use it that very week - just as soon as I&#x27;d read the manual and watched the handy little instructional DVD it came with. Then I read the part of the manual that warns against using it on \\&quot;damaged skin, including open wounds, cold sores, sunburns...\\&quot; I had just moved not long before I got the Remington I-Light Pro and between that and my normal clumsiness, I had a few scrapes and cuts on my legs. Not only that, but mosquitoes love me, so I had a couple of bites. Apparently finding a time when I have no such wounds on my legs is difficult - at least when I am busy with so many household projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a time came when everything had healed and I was ready to go. I planned an evening to use the I-Light Pro, showering and shaving again that evening even though I had shaved that morning. The instructions say it works best with clean, dry, freshly shaved areas so I wanted to be sure to prep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions again and found that I wasn&#x27;t so sure I was understanding exactly how to move the wand around the areas to be zapped. I had anticipated that I would just slide it down my legs, and it would continuously zap the areas as I moved the wand. The manual made it sound like I was mistaken. So I watched the instructional DVD before I started using it. Sure enough, the model on the DVD was holding the wand still on the skin, zapping, then picking it up and moving it just a bit further before holding it still and zapping again. I have to say the DVD was extremely helpful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armed with as much information as possible, I was ready to turn it on. The device goes into a test mode and beeps at you until you hold the area of skin you are wanting to zap over the testing scanner. If the area tests well, then the I-Light Pro activates and a green light indicates you are ready to begin. If the area does not test successfully, the I-Light Pro will not activate and you won&#x27;t be able to use it. I am a natural brunette with fair, untanned skin, so I tested well. Naturally dark or tanned skin is not recommended, as is people whose natural hair color is light or grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual warns not to overlap, so I recommend paying attention to where you begin your work and make sure you keep paying attention as you progress with the I-Light Pro. I used a freckle on each leg as my starting point so I knew where to stop when I reached the freckle again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you turn on the device, it automatically sets itself to the lowest energy setting. I started with the highest energy settings, since that is supposed to be most effective. This was fine on most of my legs, but I had to reduce to the middle energy setting for the area behind my knees. I also used the middle setting for my underarms and bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the device is really easy. You place the end of the wand completely on your skin. If it doesn&#x27;t make a proper contact, it won&#x27;t let you zap that area. The device emits a chirp when a good contact is made and allows you to zap. A working device will not allow you to zap while the wand is in mid-air, for safety reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did feel a little warmth and occasional tingles as I worked, but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable and was over with very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that you should use it once every two weeks for three treatments and then use it as needed. After the first treatment, the hair on my knees didn&#x27;t start growing again for almost two weeks. I&#x27;m not sure the hair on my thighs started regrowing at all, but then the hair there has also grown far slower and finer than anywhere else on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I performed the second treatment, I forgot to change the energy setting and used it everywhere on the lowest setting. I realized it later and thought it would be a great feature to make you select an energy level each time you start to prevent using an undesired setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now performed four treatments and can say that I do see a definite decrease in the speed at which my hair grows back although I don&#x27;t see the effect that I&#x27;d hoped for. I don&#x27;t have to shave my thighs at all anymore and shave my knees about every two weeks. My lower legs need to be shaved about once a week. The I-Light Pro seems least effective under my arms, and I have to shave there about twice a week still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be doing a fifth treatment soon and hope that it will be the one that eliminates shaving for a while. I&#x27;ll check back in once I&#x27;ve had time to know for sure. If I see more result after the next two treatments, I&#x27;ll probably raise my star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that the cartridge ran out of energy about halfway through my fourth treatment. I have been treating my underarms, full legs, and bikini area each time. I ordered the replacement cartridge ([[ASIN:B005CHHO4Q Remington SP6000SB I-Light Pro, Professional IPL Hair Removal System, Replacement Cartridge]]) from Amazon and picked up where I left off a few days later when it arrived. I&#x27;ll keep a replacement on hand now so I can finish each treatment rather than wait for an order to arrive. Changing the cartridge was an easy and quick task.t you zap that area. The device emits a chirp when a good contact is made and allows you to zap.

    <li> My recent Review and apologies to Remington:&lt;br /&gt;I did posted the first review because my item stopped working after 6 months.  I was contacted by Remington customer service Rep immediately.  They tried several troubleshooting and it did not work.  They did suggest that they will send a shipping label for me to send the item.  Before shipping the item, I decided to try one last time and to my surprise, it started working like nothing was wrong.  SO I did not send the item back and would like to apologies for my first review.  still do not have any explanation about what did really happened....  I am giving 4 stars because it has not completely removed the hair ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is my first review:&lt;br /&gt;I was among the first who did has bought this product.  Since than, I have got 3 new light replacement and still have the same amount of under arms hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 months, the who unit stopped working.  I used it maybe 2 times a month for maybe 15-20 minutes.  Did I pay so much money for such a short time?  You do advertise that instead of paying so much money for laser hair removal, we can pay 1/4th of the money and buy this unit, but did not say that it will stop working after short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a I-Light and when I changed the light I got to know that the unit is bad....  Now I have lost the price of the unit as well as the cost of replacement which I cannot use...  This is not right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the unhappiest customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please advise on how can I either fix the problem or suggest any other solution.</li>
    <li> I only wish it worked faster! I have had this item for a couple months, so I&#x27;ve gone through three cycles. I notice my leg hair was really affected until this last treatment, but the hair regrowth everywhere else has greatly diminished or stopped altogether. This product specificially states not to use on your face .... but I have used it on my sideburns, chin, and under my nose with fantastic results. I also use it on my bikini area, legs, underarms, and boyfriend&#x27;s back! Great little device. Be sure to shave thoroughly prior to use. It does sting a little while in use, but not much more than a rubberband snap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to use &amp; effective&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Takes a while to see results &amp; its expensive</li>
    <li> I see many of people expect that it can remove hairs permanently (Like me when I bought it), but results are not permanent. In the first two months that you use it, you will see great result (based on how you cover all the spots of your skin)... but right now after 6 months of the first use (for two months), I have almost 90% of my hairs back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be aware: \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t remove hairs permanently... You need to use it for a life time to call it a permanent hair removal system!...\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and even increased the power of the light, but I still haven&#x27;t seen any improved results. I gave it 2 stars for the ease of use. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 4 months and only on my legs, but they are the same as before. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair so I thought it would work faster. I think I&#x27;ll go back to using my epilator since I know my legs will have smoother results.</li>
    <li> We love the machine, and I notice a big difference.  However...I am very disappointed in the&lt;br /&gt;amount of flashes we get per cartridge.  I&#x27;m guessing 500 flashes or less.  We purchased the machine&lt;br /&gt;plus 3 additional cartridges because we wanted to stock up.  We are down to 1 cartridge left already&lt;br /&gt;and we&#x27;ve only had the machine for 2 months max.  I came on here today to order more cartridges, but&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little peeved about having to order them so soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they come out with better cartridges.</li>
    <li> Got the item about 6 weeks ago and so far I am very satisfied. I decided to do certain areas first and then work on other ones instead of doing full body treatments all in one sessions. I like doing it this way. In the long run it&#x27;s taking alot longer but I&#x27;m able to keep track of progress and not have to spend 45 minutes or more per session. The pain is very minimal. I use the highest setting and I hardly feel it except on my underarms where the hair is a bit thicker. Just did my 3rd treatment today and I think it&#x27;s working great. The hair is growing much slower and has become thinner for sure...even a couple patches where the hair is gone altogether. I&#x27;m thinking within the next two weeks most areas will be hair free if the progress continues. Overall good product and I would suggest it to others.</li>
    <li> Giving this a true test.  My disabled sister has heavy hair growth so we are trying to give her one less thing to worry about.  I haven&#x27;t seen the results that they claim but we are still in the process of learning.  Need more time to see whether it will work well for her.  it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> First off just want to let everyone know that i am a guy and i am using this product from my neck to my waste line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shaved with a regular razor as directed and did my first session. I did it on the highest voltage and Im not going to lie it hurts. I have a very high pain tolerance and for some reason it feels like someone is snapping a rubber-band on my stomach and chest as hard as they can. I had a horrible reaction on my chest and it was from just shaving. I had ingrown hairs all over and they were very annoying. I recommend that you shave your body with clippers because that never gives me ingrown hairs. After the first couple of days went by and i was ready for my second treatment i didn&#x27;t notice any change and my hair was growing back as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my chest broke out so bad i decided to just do my stomach area and upper abdomen. I used clippers and didn&#x27;t get any ingrown hairs this time. It still hurt like a son of a bi*ch. I noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t growing back as thick and as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third Treatment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did my third treatment on my stomach and second treatment on my chest today. I still have bumps on my chest from shaving with a razor the first time and used clippers this time and don&#x27;t feel like i will have a bad reaction again.  I  am still using the intensity on high and it wasn&#x27;t as painful as the first two times. I feel like some areas are having results but overall nothing is really happening.  It says that you are suppose to do it 3 times in the first 2 weeks and then it should be hair free for 6 months and only touch up will be necessary. I highly doubt this will occur and i am going to try and call costumer support as the video directs to try and find a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ill try and keep you guys updated and it was hard finding a review on males using this product so i felt i had to share my experience. Overall i would not recommend this product just yet. Ill let you guys know if i change my mind within the next couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews before I bought it, and I was still surprised how well it worked.  I have some grey hair and it took those out too.  I did use it more than the once every two weeks, but it doesn&#x27;t take very long to use.</li>
    <li> if you really want to achieve fast and long-lasting results,better buy a hair removal deal from livingsocial or groupon for a local salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this machine did not work for me,the good reviews that were posted seem to be fake...makes me think that people got paid to post these reviews....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it hurts,even on the highest setting it does not work as well as professional machines in the salon...hair removal at salons is fairly cheap at this point of time if to get a deal from groupon,livingsocial or negotiate directly with local salon</li>
    <li> Worth every penny!  Excellent results!</li>
    <li> It certainly zaps the hairs.  Have not used it long enough to know if it kills them or not.  It is faster than plucking.</li>
    <li> It does not work as advertised and I will ask for a refund.</li>
    <li> three words. I smell burning. If pressing a white hot flash bulb against your skin removes hair....sign me up I guess. works ok. but it would take a year to do a big body part in 1cm increments. But if you have the time, I say go for it</li>
    <li> I purchased this machine in March. I had a small issue that the box had been opened. I contacted the seller and he assured me the unit was new, unused. As a courtesy he refunded $40.00 because the box had been opened. I did my first treatment the end of March and each additional treatment 2-3 weeks apart. I have preformed 4 treatments and the results have been very encouraging. I have 60-70% less hair. I have treated my legs, both top and bottom, my underarms and my bikini line. The light that came with the machine gave me 3 full treatments. I think more than the 1500 pulses that is usually the life span of the light. But than I had less luck with my replacement lights. I did not buy the replacement light from this seller so he is not responsible for this. You can read my reviews for them by going to that link. I am discouraged by the replacement lights but very encouraged by the machine. And I would completely recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this system after reading all the negative reviews.  I have only used it on small areas, and it is working.  I have had professional laser hair removal on my legs, and this is not as good as that, but it is doing a slow but steady job of removing my unwanted hair.  I have had no problems with the flash cartridge.</li>
    <li> This is me and my girls new best friend.  I had laser treatments for years and this works just as well.  Very sensitive to darker skin color.  It will not work if you are tan or dark.  Works terrific and on my terms! I love it!</li>
