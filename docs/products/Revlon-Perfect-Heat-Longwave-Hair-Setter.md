      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>Good value!</li>
      <li>Great curlers.</li>
      <li>These are great.</li>
      <li>These are fantastic and are a great price too!</li>
      <li>I actually really loved these....</li>
      <li>Super impressed.  </li>
      <li>Heats up quickly - makes great, long-lasting curls!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love the product!</li>
      <li>The curls didn&#x27;t turn out the nice spiral shape that I expected.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice carrying case.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m extremely happy with these hot rollers!.</li>
      <li>I have very fine hair that never holds a curl.  </li>
      <li>II have below shoulder length baby fine hair, and these rollers work a treat!</li>
      <li>However, this setter is Phenomenal.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this hair setter.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;2)I tried a couple times until I recognized that this was way more time consuming than the curling ion I have, so I&#x27;ll have to return this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>These curlers arrived last week, and I am very happy with them.</li>
      <li>I love how they are compact and I love that you get 12 rollers, which is what every woman needs.</li>
      <li>Love the length of rollers - perfect for my long hair.  </li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s what I loved about them at first.</li>
      <li>I left them in until they were completely cool and my curls were wonderful and lasted for 2 days!</li>
      <li>I have long hair and it was great that they are longer than most rollers, got hot quickly and are compact for great travel.</li>
      <li>Easily held my shoulder-length hair</li>
      <li>A compact, easy to use set.  </li>
      <li>The curls come out best when you spiral your hair onto the roller and don&#x27;t just roll your hair like you would traditional hot rollers.</li>
      <li>Easy Peasy to fit in the corners of the suitcase.</li>
      <li>Great for long hair, heats up in 10 min, curls in 15.</li>
      <li>I think they work fine, but i mostly use some old conair clasps that I&#x27;ve used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
      <li>Some of the reviews I read indicated that the curlers were very hot to the touch.  </li>
      <li>My wife said the curlers are too hot!</li>
      <li>Maybe if I was more patient or willing to spend more time learning to use this specific type it would work.</li>
      <li>These get super hot so becareful handling.  </li>
      <li>just right it tends to lean or fall off.</li>
      <li>Curls my long hair spectacularly.  </li>
      <li>Super easy to keep the rollers and clips in, I will only use these!</li>
      <li>I have been using hot rollers to curl my hair for 15 years.</li>
      <li>Yea they do get really hot</li>
      <li>at first.</li>
      <li>The hair just spreads out along the roller as I rolll and the heat is just right to heat the whole leangth of the roller.&lt;br</li>
      <li>curlers and better because you can spiral curl medium to long hair.  </li>
      <li>so I bought some extra clips from Conair and double clipped the rollers which kept them more secure.</li>
      <li>The packaging and storing is very convenient and does not take up a lot of space if you&#x27;re packing for travel.  </li>
      <li>heats up fast.</li>
      <li>I just take the whole thing apart for packing when I go on travel.</li>
      <li>Plus it saves her time in the morning when she is getting ready for work.</li>
      <li>I usually don&#x27;t comb or brush the curls, but just run my fingers through and have a really nice affect.</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that it does get very hot.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>I have really long thick hair down to my waist and these hot rollers work great!</li>
      <li>but all rollers should be this long , much better for long hair.</li>
      <li>They are too hot to handle and the curl didn&#x27;t last.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer commented they get really hot, and they do, they ARE hot rollers, but I don&#x27;t believe they were any hotter than the ones I used previously (Conair).</li>
      <li>an hour later it&#x27;s straight again.  </li>
      <li>I have medium/shoulder length hair and these are to heavy to be comfortable or to stay up.</li>
      <li>/&gt;For anyone who&#x27;s willing to give it a shot, I will give you some pros: It heats up fast (though it&#x27;s a little hot to the touch), and it is one of the few longer  hair setters within a reasonable price range in the market.</li>
      <li>I Didn&#x27;t know how much  I would like long rollers</li>
      <li>but I was super bummed out that these literally started falling apart after a few months.</li>
      <li>They give me long waves of just the right curve and if I use gel on my hair (then dry it)</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these if you have really long hair!</li>

<li> I just use my fingers yo comb out my hair after taking out the rollers, and I get an entirely different look than when I used the other rollers.</li>
<li> These do not sit on long metal posts, they sit on tiny little metal plugs and manage to distribute the heat evenly throughout the roller.  </li>
<li> These are way less $$ than the ones sold on QVC by a different brand.</li>
<li> my hair catches a little on the teeth, but overall I like them.</li>
<li> Returning for two reasons: 1)Love the concept of longer rollers, but the clip was just not strong enough to properly hold my hair in tightly.  </li>
<li> Takes half the time of a curling iron.  </li>
<li> They gradually began chipping and cracking flaking off little peices of black plastic into my hair.</li>
<li> Clips hold curlers in place tightly.  </li>
<li> Rollers are very heavy and the clip is weak...curlers fall out as soon as you let go of it</li>
<li> Too heavy, hard to use and slow to heat.</li>
<li> Way too slow for me.</li>
<li> is a little awkward.  </li>
<li> Sits on my bathroom vanity and if you done get the curler back on the base</li>
<li> I like the travel carrying case, but these curlers are difficult to use.</li>
<li> Thus the two star rating. :(</li>
<li> Would have given 5 stars but base</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like the travel carrying case, but these curlers are difficult to use.They are too hot to handle and the curl didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> Great hairsetter!  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that it does get very hot.  I have a glove I got with a flat iron which I use sometimes when my fingers can&#x27;t handle the heat.  Heats up quickly - makes great, long-lasting curls!  Good value!</li>
    <li> A compact, easy to use set.  Nice carrying case.  Easily held my shoulder-length hair</li>
    <li> You cannot hold the rollers to roll your hair without getting burned.</li>
    <li> II have below shoulder length baby fine hair, and these rollers work a treat! They give me long waves of just the right curve and if I use gel on my hair (then dry it) the rollers will set the waves all day.  I roll from the middle rather than the end, so that&#x27;s how I get the waves. The hair just spreads out along the roller as I rolll and the heat is just right to heat the whole leangth of the roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see some people don&#x27;t like the clasps. I think they work fine, but i mostly use some old conair clasps that I&#x27;ve used for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a note. Don&#x27;t heat the rollers in the bag. The bag is just for carrying. I just take the whole thing apart for packing when I go on travel. Easy Peasy to fit in the corners of the suitcase.</li>
    <li> Curls my long hair spectacularly.  Heats up quickly.  Clips hold curlers in place tightly.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> my hair catches a little on the teeth, but overall I like them. Wish they had wider rollers in this set</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this hair setter.  I have very fine hair that never holds a curl.  I curl and an hour later it&#x27;s straight again.  However, this setter is Phenomenal.  I use it in the mornings and I still have curl at the end of the day.  I use a regular mousse and a frizz control on wet hair; dry it and curl.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great for long hair, heats up in 10 min, curls in 15. Super easy to keep the rollers and clips in, I will only use these!</li>
    <li> Great product! It heats up in about 5 minutes.  If you apply all the heated rollers to your hair and keep in for about 5-10 minutes or until you feel the curl has cooled, you&#x27;ll be amazed as to how curled your hair is. I usually don&#x27;t comb or brush the curls, but just run my fingers through and have a really nice affect. The curls will hold all day! The packaging and storing is very convenient and does not take up a lot of space if you&#x27;re packing for travel.  This product is excellent to use for setting wigs or weaved hair as well!</li>
    <li> Some of the reviews I read indicated that the curlers were very hot to the touch.  They are no hotter than &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; curlers and better because you can spiral curl medium to long hair.  Takes half the time of a curling iron.  Would have given 5 stars but base is a little awkward.  Sits on my bathroom vanity and if you done get the curler back on the base just right it tends to lean or fall off.</li>
    <li> I Didn&#x27;t know how much  I would like long rollers but all rollers should be this long , much better for long hair. heats up fast. I don&#x27;t care for the set up though</li>
    <li> Super impressed.  These get super hot so becareful handling.  Love the length of rollers - perfect for my long hair.  Holds curl if set with hairspray.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with these hot rollers!. These do not sit on long metal posts, they sit on tiny little metal plugs and manage to distribute the heat evenly throughout the roller.  Love the product!</li>
    <li> My sister in law loves it. I gave it to her for the holidays. Her hair is longer than mine. Plus it saves her time in the morning when she is getting ready for work.</li>
    <li> I actually really loved these....at first. Yea they do get really hot but that&#x27;s what I loved about them at first. I have long hair and it was great that they are longer than most rollers, got hot quickly and are compact for great travel. This was of coarse until they started falling apart! They gradually began chipping and cracking flaking off little peices of black plastic into my hair. Perhaps I just had a defective unit but I was super bummed out that these literally started falling apart after a few months. Thus the two star rating. :(</li>
    <li> My wife said the curlers are too hot!</li>
    <li> Returned them. Rollers are very heavy and the clip is weak...curlers fall out as soon as you let go of it</li>
    <li> These curlers arrived last week, and I am very happy with them. I have been using hot rollers to curl my hair for 15 years. These are great. I have shoulder length hair, and I place the rollers to create spirals. Another reviewer commented they get really hot, and they do, they ARE hot rollers, but I don&#x27;t believe they were any hotter than the ones I used previously (Conair). I just use my fingers yo comb out my hair after taking out the rollers, and I get an entirely different look than when I used the other rollers. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> Returning for two reasons: 1)Love the concept of longer rollers, but the clip was just not strong enough to properly hold my hair in tightly.  The curls didn&#x27;t turn out the nice spiral shape that I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)I tried a couple times until I recognized that this was way more time consuming than the curling ion I have, so I&#x27;ll have to return this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone who&#x27;s willing to give it a shot, I will give you some pros: It heats up fast (though it&#x27;s a little hot to the touch), and it is one of the few longer  hair setters within a reasonable price range in the market.</li>
    <li> Great curlers. The curls come out best when you spiral your hair onto the roller and don&#x27;t just roll your hair like you would traditional hot rollers. The curls last all day. These are way less $$ than the ones sold on QVC by a different brand. I love how they are compact and I love that you get 12 rollers, which is what every woman needs. Not just 8 rollers!</li>
    <li> I have really long thick hair down to my waist and these hot rollers work great! I read all the reviews and comments about the long rollers so I bought some extra clips from Conair and double clipped the rollers which kept them more secure. I left them in until they were completely cool and my curls were wonderful and lasted for 2 days! These are fantastic and are a great price too! I highly recommend these if you have really long hair!</li>
    <li> Too heavy, hard to use and slow to heat. Recommended to take 15min heat up time, 15 min in hair. Way too slow for me. I have medium/shoulder length hair and these are to heavy to be comfortable or to stay up. Maybe if I was more patient or willing to spend more time learning to use this specific type it would work. I could curl all my hair with an iron faster than this.</li>
