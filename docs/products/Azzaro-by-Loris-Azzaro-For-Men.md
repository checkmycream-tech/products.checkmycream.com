    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this Azzaro product (2 items 3.4 oz and I&#x27;m planing to reship the other-Because I&#x27;ve opened the one)  and  I am disappointed. Actually before I&#x27;ve bought the same product but from the different seller (it was good and when I compare them they have different fragrance )and I really wonder this Azzaro is REAL !</li>
