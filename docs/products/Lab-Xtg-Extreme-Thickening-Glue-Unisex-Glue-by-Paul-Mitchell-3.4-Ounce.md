      <li>What&#x27;s inside doesn&#x27;t even smell like the original.</li>
      <li>The item shipped from this seller is a counterfeit of the original product.</li>
      <li>the original</li>
      <li>/&gt;The downside is, as it is super sticky, it pulls some of my hairs while applying it, and, if it touches your scalp, it gives me some rash, if  heavy.&lt;br</li>

      <li>Love this hair glue and was glad to find it at a reasonable price online since I cannot find it my area available to the public anywhere.  </li>

      <li>I have used this hair glue for several years and think it is amazing.</li>
      <li>It is not readily available (unless you hang out in hair salons), so Amaazon is a great way to get it.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this is really like a glue that will give you more flexibility with creating volume of your hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other hair gels, over the hours cannot keep up with the moisture, especially during the summer, but this one will allow me to fix the hair</li>
      <li>I have tried other &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34; but none work as good as this product.</li>
      <li>went into Sally Beauty supplies and right away</li>
      <li>/&gt;Although this worked pretty well, I found myself switching over to LUSH Cosmetics&#x27; &amp;#34;zest hair gel&amp;#34; which has been much better and lasted longer.</li>
      <li>My hair is fine (even though I have a lot of it) and straight LabXg  really holds my hair.  </li>

    <li> I have used this hair glue for several years and think it is amazing. Hope they don&#x27;t take it off the market.</li>
    <li> This is the only hair product I use.  It doesn&#x27;t look wet and goopy (I use it on dry hair)[[ASIN:B0013YV29U Paul Mitchell Firm Style XTG - Extreme Thickening Glue (3.4 oz)]].....the hold is firm and natural looking, just like your hair has some supernatural body to it.   Its one of those things that when you run out of it, your life just isn&#x27;t the same. (ie toilet paper, food, car keys)</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s hair gel I&#x27;ve found. Holds hair solid without looking wet or greasy. I&#x27;ve used this now for over 5 years and love it.</li>

    <li> Great product, went straight to Germany :)</li>
    <li> Great for short to medium short hair.</li>
    <li> This is amazing.  When you put this on your hair to style it, the hair stays where you put it.  I spike my hair and this glue works to keep the style all day.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found to spike my hair and believe me I have tried many products before I discovered this glue. I love that it does not look wet and shiny when applied. It leaves your hair looking natural. The hold is SUPERB.  You determine the strength of the hold by the amount you apply. Thank you Paul Mitchell for offering this product, I LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My local salon stopped carrying this product. :(  It is GREAT for short hair - provides lots of control that doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in your hair after you wash it. For less control, just put a drop of water with it before you apply.</li>
    <li> I also use this on hair. People are always stopping me and asking me how I get my hair to do so good!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and recommending it to all my friends.  My hair is fine (even though I have a lot of it) and straight LabXg  really holds my hair.  The store where I purchased has stopped carrying it.  I ordered three bottles, and hope I can still order from you.  It is the best product that I have ever had for holding my hair all day!</li>
    <li> Its amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Its very sticky and you can make any style.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, its also washed away very easily with water.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I wear my hair somewhat &amp;#34;wind blown look&amp;#34; and I tell you it stays put.  I use to spike my hair and it was great for that.</li>
    <li> Have not used this bottle but have used this product before.</li>
    <li> I was glad to have found the hair glue on Amazon after being unable to find it in stores any longer!  It&#x27;s a perfect product for fine hair. Thanks Amazon!  Julie B.</li>
    <li> Love pm dry wax.  Use it all year. Gave the glue a try. Yuck. First thing u will notice is the smell. Like bacon. And it doesnt hold near as good as their wax or got2b gel brand much better. If u want less hold and to smell luke bacon. U want hold and no smell buy paul mitchell dry waxpm</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this thickening glue, although it&#x27;s not for everyone.  It does live up to its name and indeed has the consistency of glue.  That said, I have a pixie cut and have been using this product for years.  I think it works best on short or layered hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor was great to deal with, and the product arrived promptly.  All in all, I give Lab Xtg Extreme Thickening Glue 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This product is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for my short and sassy hairstyle! I apply it after blow drying my hair, and then can very easily style it.  Have used it for years and was quite upset when I couldn&#x27;t find it at any salons or stores. I tried several other products. All of them failed to measure up to Lab Xtg Extreme! Glad I finally found Lab on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This gives me the super hold I want with very little product.  A little bit goes a long way.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> This product is one of the best products on the market!  It is hard to find in stores.  Even though it is a little costly it goes a long ways and last me a good while.  I hope they never discontinue this one!</li>

    <li> Thickening glue is the greatest thing for short hair. I have used a lot of products but this is the best one yet. I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> The BEST for making hair do what you want!</li>
    <li> I have been using this glue in my short, funky cut hair for a long time.  Its the perfect product to hold the shape I want!</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found. I want more!</li>
    <li> This is the only hair glue that really works for my hair...our local stores were out of stock so I had to order on line...which I paid $3.00 more for it;-(  It was about an inch from the top and dryer than the usual.  With that being said I will not order on line again.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I have very short hair which I spike. I have tried other &amp;#34;glues&amp;#34; but none work as good as this product.</li>
    <li> This styling glue offers a strong hold - I wear my hat in a visor at work sometime 9 hours a day, and it often leaves me having &amp;#34;hat hair&amp;#34; at the end of my work day. I can easily piece my hair back to it&#x27;s place and continue on with the rest of my day.</li>
    <li> I like to wear my thin hair spiked and even though I have treid other products Lab is still my favorite. I find it hard to find Lab in the salons but found it on Amazon and ordered it and received it within 1 week.  Did not even have shipping charges.</li>
    <li> Very good, very washable, easy to use (no need of excessive amount)</li>
    <li> Love this hair glue and was glad to find it at a reasonable price online since I cannot find it my area available to the public anywhere.  It has great hold and is at a good price for having it shipped to you.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a replacement for L&#x27;Anza Tight styling product that is apparently being discontinued. Xtg Extreme Thickening Glue holds my short, fine hair nearly as well. The problem is the smell. It is so bad that I can&#x27;t stand having it in my hair. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s going in the garbage.</li>
    <li> My hubby&#x27;s favorite hair product. He tries new ones and this is the one he always turns back to and it&#x27;s been hard to find in stores anymore! Thank you amazon!!!</li>
    <li> The item shipped from this seller is a counterfeit of the original product. The bottle is so bad they didn&#x27;t even attempt to&lt;br /&gt;copy the original that well. What&#x27;s inside doesn&#x27;t even smell like the original. Buyer beware not what you think you&#x27;re getting!</li>
    <li> I love this product, I have thick but fine hair (if that makes sense) And this is the only product that holds my spikey hair in place. I have an inverted bob and spike it in the back and I have used all types of holding products from Kenra to Big Sexy hair products and this is by far the best and the hold lasts. The only complaint that I have is the smell of the product needs The paul Mitchell smell not the Elmer Glue smell, hence the 4 star rating!</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever for stiffening hair.&lt;br /&gt;I went into Sally Beauty supplies and right away&lt;br /&gt;they said there&#x27;s nothing that compares. Only problem&lt;br /&gt;is, it&#x27;s very hard to find.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!  I have thin, fine hair--every wax or thickener always weighed my hair down!  I am getting the fullness I want, without the weight!  I use this everyday.</li>
    <li> too sticky.  pulled my hair out</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Can&#x27;t find it in my town anymore.</li>
    <li> Great for short hair styling!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product especially if your hair is thick, naturally curly and course.  I keep this on hand always.</li>
    <li> I have thick black hair and got this product off of someone&#x27;s recommendation.  At first I was a little skepticle because the gel is white, but I never actually have had any issues with it flaking or being visible in my (black) hair so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is thick, this is one of the few hair gels that can actually hold my hair in a certain shape. I&#x27;d say it lasts about 5-6 hours with its hold for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this worked pretty well, I found myself switching over to LUSH Cosmetics&#x27; &amp;#34;zest hair gel&amp;#34; which has been much better and lasted longer.</li>
    <li> This product is getting hard to find.  It works great in my hair and I&#x27;m stocking up before it is gone.</li>
    <li> The best hold product for me! Have been using it for years! Paul Mitchell has it figured out here. Don&#x27;t want to see this disappear from retail!</li>
