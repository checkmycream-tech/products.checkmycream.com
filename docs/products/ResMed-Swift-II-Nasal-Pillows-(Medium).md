    <li> Perfect replacement as the &amp;#34;Small&amp;#34; size before was not quite big enough.  This one is very durable, comfortable and has no problem handling the occasional alcohol swab along with daily O-3 sterilization in the CPAP mask cleaner.</li>
    <li> They are as comfortable as a nasal pillow can be. Just ensure the angle is and remains at 90 degrees.</li>
    <li> Very speedy delivery, great product, great packaging, great experience!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Perfect nasal pillows for replacement to my CPAP machine.  These fit perfectly and were exactly what I originally had with my mask. Shipping was speedy too!</li>
    <li> I cannot rate a product that I never received. I kept getting a message that the order was shipped on 07/19/2013.  When I didn&#x27;t receive it after a couple of weeks, I sent an inquiry and was told the item was on back order.  I waited another 7-10 days and inquired again.  I was asked if I had checked with my local post office!  At that time I was so frustrated, I asked for a refund and plan to order the pillow from another source.</li>
    <li> Hard to say I love anything about the CPAP machine. I really like using the nose pillows over the masks. The price is jacked up because of the proprietary design but it was at least reasonable with this company.</li>
    <li> As mentioned in my review for the Mirage Swift, I was not happy with the design or cost of these pillows.  They are uncomfortable, do not stay where they are adjusted in the frame.  Back to the mask.</li>
    <li> This is where &amp;#34;The rubber meets the nose&amp;#34; - and somehow, this seems made of firmer rubber than the original.</li>
    <li> Just like fresh pillows cases.</li>
    <li> we replace these every year -- fit is great</li>
    <li> Perfect fit, works great.  Fit right onto my new Swift head gear that I bought.  Not much else to say.</li>
    <li> This product works, I wish it weren&#x27;t $18, but it works. The six ft hose is only $4, seems like the prices are reversed.</li>
    <li> I have used the mask I bought these for for several years.  Never have I had pillows chafe like these did.  They are a stiffer sort of rubber from the ones I got from the manufacturer, I suspect.</li>
    <li> continue to repurchase. good price, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Exactly the same thing as the CPAP company was socking me a lot of money for. This is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> it did not fit my machine. it has a ridge line that the old one does not have so would not fit.</li>
    <li> Received it in only a couple of days which that on its self was great.  The product is made of quality materials and I am very pleased with it</li>
    <li> A decent replacement for the original. No adjustments needed. It lines up well works as well as the original did.</li>
