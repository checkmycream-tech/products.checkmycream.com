    <li> I have always enjoyed Moon Drops lipstick, but over the years, it has been hard to find the colors I love.  So nice to know that you can still get these hard-to-find items on Amazon.  This was a brand-new lipstick that met my expectations.  The color, Silverspun Rose ,was just as I remembered it from \\&quot;yesteryear\\&quot; (I&#x27;m talking the late 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s).  Same smooth texture and shimmer that I enjoy.  Glides on and stays on for a long time.  Even after the shimmer fades, you still have a nice stain of color that lasts and lasts.  Very creamy and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love the old moondrops lipsticks.  Wish you could still buy them in the stores.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that the color is different from the picture. It&#x27;s still a good color but not the one I want.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this color at the stores anymore.  Been using it forever.  Always get compliments.  Didn&#x27;t want to stop using it.  Purchased 2 tubes and still love it as always.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Taylor</li>

    <li> I love this color, especially for the Spring, its bright, thought with lipstick you can put it on light, or heavier, its up to you.  Its softly moisturizing, and goes on smoothly, has no bad smell, and is just wonderful. Im happy, I do recommend this brand and color.</li>
    <li> Finally found my color lipstick again. Love it! It stays on all day:)&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for this for a while and just ran out of my old one so I bought 5 when I could find it.</li>
    <li> I brought this from Rite aid for 25cent  One of my favorite lipstick💜 its goes on so smooth it reminds me of n.y. moisturized lipsticks so its my favorite the color is like a rose gold with a frosty sheen</li>
