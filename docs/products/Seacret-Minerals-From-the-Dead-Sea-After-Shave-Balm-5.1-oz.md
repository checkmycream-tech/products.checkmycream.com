<li> And the tube lasts a very long time, a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> A subtle, masculine scent.</li>
<li> It uses aloe vera juice instead of gel (gel is superior), it has all these fake vitamins in it, now, it isn&#x27;t as smooth and the consistency is wrong (slightly thicker in a bad way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very little will go a long way.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s job just as the original and moisturizes the face, but was disappointed in the fragrance.</li>
<li> /&gt;Given the fact that I thought I was getting what I&#x27;d bought previously, I may have to hit amazon up on a refund since they&#x27;ve got the wrong picture up.</li>
<li> I got 3 secret</li>
<li> , I&#x27;m just very disappointed with the changes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Use it every time I shave</li>
    <li> Amazing, all that needs to be said, especially if you&#x27;re prone to razor irritation</li>
    <li> My barber told me I had dry skin.  I had some of this from several years ago and I used it.  I liked it so much I bought more.  I really do like it.</li>
    <li> My husband and son like this product. It soften the facial hair, therefore reducing ingrown hair causing less skin outbreak.</li>
    <li> Has a nice aroma, with-out the greasy feel like some Balm&#x27;s I have tried. A lttle bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very excellent product for my face. It doesn&#x27;t burn at all. Leavesmy skin smooth and brightens by face a little. I do recommend buying this product. A++++</li>
    <li> **edit** March 28th, 2014 - That pic is of the old product. Seacret has reformulated it, the tube is different and labelled differently, too, and now has a brown cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as good as it used to be. It smells different, but not bad. It has a lot more alcohol in it than it used to (burns a bit, too), even the wording on the back describing it is different in order to mask the changes (imo). It uses aloe vera juice instead of gel (gel is superior), it has all these fake vitamins in it, now, it isn&#x27;t as smooth and the consistency is wrong (slightly thicker in a bad way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the fact that I thought I was getting what I&#x27;d bought previously, I may have to hit amazon up on a refund since they&#x27;ve got the wrong picture up. That said, it&#x27;s still better than most stuff out there, I&#x27;m just very disappointed with the changes. This used to be a 5 star product absolutely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**original review when I gave it five stars**&lt;br /&gt;It goes on cool and smooth and soothes, it leaves my skin feeling great, and women love how it smells. A subtle, masculine scent. And the tube lasts a very long time, a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> My husband loved this gift.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything prior to this and nothing ever worked with my sensative skin but this is definitely THE SECRET to beautiful skin for men!!</li>
    <li> Use after every shave. Skins feels really smooth and soft. Have used it for almost a year now, great product.</li>
    <li> The fragrance was not the same as in the smaller original bottle which was a wonderful smell which is what I was hoping for. The balm part does it&#x27;s job just as the original and moisturizes the face, but was disappointed in the fragrance. I just need to keep looking and it&#x27;s possible they changed the formula and I&#x27;ll never find it. Nice size bottle.</li>
    <li> As described and on time delivery.</li>
    <li> I have used several of the Seacret products and they are all great.  This one is no exception.  Subtle fragrance and good moisturizing. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and arrived very promptly</li>
    <li> Great product but pricey.  My wife says it has a nice smell without being too strong.</li>
    <li> My beloved just loves this cream.  He says: &amp;#34;it&#x27;s a gentle, pleasant scent. Very little will go a long way. No greasy feeling, very refreshing.  It smells like the ocean actually.  I&#x27;ve experienced very expensive European brand creams and this one is by far the best.&amp;#34;  I love it when he puts it on, he smells so good!</li>
    <li> exellent price, delivery before due time, packed beautiful. I would recomend this product to everybody.  I got 3 secret minerals- after shave balm for the price of one, even including postage</li>
    <li> LOVE THE SMELL, HUSBAND LOVES THE FEEL ON HIS FACE AND NECK!</li>
