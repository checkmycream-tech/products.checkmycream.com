      <li>Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have any pimples instead of</li>
      <li>These have really helped me and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has these available!</li>
      <li>Affordable and very useful.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try Dream Dots Treatment Patches for Breakouts.  </li>
      <li>I followed these instructions, and applied to clean skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this is for people with a face full of acne</li>
      <li>This is ok at night, but not as much during the day.</li>
      <li>Guaranteed to wake up spot free &amp; ready for any occasion!</li>
      <li>I really like how easy the product is to use.</li>
      <li>find these really useful for those summertime heat spots that don&#x27;t seem to resolve.  </li>

      <li>They suggest you use this 4-5 days (depending on how long it takes to be effective) during the night time.</li>
      <li>No one wants a waitress with a leaky gross zit touching their food!</li>
      <li>instead, expect it to look better and be much farther along the healing process than it would have otherwise been... that is, expect a reduction in pain, redness, and inflammation but don&#x27;t expect the blemish to completely vanish</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t eat sweet things, because it will disrupt your hormone, this is one of the main reasons why teenagers have pimples.</li>
      <li>Also, for the price, they really weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about health product claims, so it is with great pleasure that I announce - THIS PRODUCT WORKS!</li>
      <li>When I tried it, my blemish was much better in the morning although there was still a red spot</li>
      <li>I will say some of the similar products out there work just as well but are more visible.</li>
      <li>Only recommendation is to make sure you have it on for a long time or else it hurts when you take it off :)</li>
      <li>I am in no way obligated to rate or review this item in any way other than with my honest feedback.</li>
      <li>I am in no way obligated to rate or review this item in any way other than with my honest feedback.ting and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinions with these dream dots.</li>
      <li>And I really appreciate how much they help with keeping my damn hands off my face!</li>
      <li>but I have super sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I had very high hopes for these dots.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>These work very well for my son.</li>
      <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting too much</li>
      <li>This really works in absorbing acne and pimple bulges overnight.</li>
      <li>There was a very noticeable reduction in the size of inflammation.</li>
      <li>I was ready to try and peel off the layer</li>
      <li>Really a touch of genius.&lt;br /&gt;Test</li>
      <li>really ,really works for me</li>
      <li>product has been very helpful.</li>
      <li>We will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
      <li>I used one of these dots that night and when I woke up the next morning I was in awe and really excited about these.</li>
      <li>Dots keep the area clean and literally draw out the inflammation, and next morning my skin is well on its way to repair the problem.  </li>
      <li>They are actually very discreet looking and look better than a flaming red white head!</li>
      <li>The dots are great - they stay on really well and are hard to see, and the blemishes are flat by morning!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these and will definitely be purchasing these regularly.</li>
      <li>Especially if they need to use it on more than one pimple that require multiple applications.</li>
      <li>So, I gave a 5 star for their performance, but I do think the cost is too high.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend Dream Dots .</li>
      <li>OMG, I can&#x27;t live without dream dots.</li>
      <li>A new treatment for the face by applying a path over the blemish overnight and then waking up to the result of an acne-free face.</li>
      <li>I really love these little dots!</li>
      <li>These clever little patches would have changed my life if they had been available years ago when my face was plagued by intermittent stress-related breakouts.  </li>
      <li>That is going to last us quite a while considering how fast these work!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> These work very well for my son. He has the usual T-Zone teenage acne, but it does bother him quite a bit. This is an easy and non-irritating way to extract the whitehead when it appears. We will be ordering more in the near future. It&#x27;s not a cure for acne, but it helps to lessen the discomfort.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have an acne problem but I do get one or two during my monthly menstrual cycle. Initially I was a little skeptical about this product about whether or not it was effective and how it worked. I really like how easy the product is to use. Just wash your face or cleanse the area your going to treat. Peel the cover off the sticker and place it over the blemish, press for 30 seconds, and its as simple as that. They adhere to the skin well and stay on all night. I&#x27;ve yet to have one that has fallen off. They are sticky enough to stay on as you toss and turn  yet they peel easily off your skin leaving no glue/sticky residue behind. They&#x27;re comfortable to wear to the point that I forgot I had them on. They are visible up-close, but not so noticeable that people would look twice in passing. The product seems to work best on pimples that are mature with a whitehead. Overnight, the initially translucent sticker had swelled and turned in the center, apparently working like a sponge drawing out the oil / pus from the pimple.There was a very noticeable reduction in the size of inflammation. Another application the very next evening and the pimple was almost completely gone by the following morning. Overall this product worked effectively for me but I think it can become costly for those that suffer from acne. Especially if they need to use it on more than one pimple that require multiple applications.</li>
    <li> I had very high hopes for these dots. I am a teenage girl who suffers badly from acne. These dots didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought they would. They only worked if the pimple was open and bleeding/pus coming out. Otherwise they just didn&#x27;t work at all. Also, for the price, they really weren&#x27;t worth it. I may reorder, simply because when they do work, they work great, however I definitely will look around at other brands first.</li>
    <li> I really love these little dots! They are the only ones that virtually disappear on my skin. These have definitely cut down on healing time and the compulsion to pick at spot and make so much worse. I will say some of the similar products out there work just as well but are more visible. This is ok at night, but not as much during the day. So, I gave a 5 star for their performance, but I do think the cost is too high. They are more than double the cost of other similar products. It&#x27;s difficult to pay over $17 for only 24 dots when you can get others that work as well for $7. I guess I will be buying the less expensive on a regular basis and just order these when absolutely needed for daytime. If the price were to be reduced, these would be my everyday go to without a doubt.</li>
    <li> these seem to work well and were almost invisible on the skin. would buy again except is pricey.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all. I thought maybe it was just me, but it didn&#x27;t work for my boyfriend either. I was really disappointed.</li>
    <li> OMG, I can&#x27;t live without dream dots. Guaranteed to wake up spot free &amp; ready for any occasion! 😃</li>
    <li> I am absolutely delighted with my purchase. I have been looking for something like this for a long time, only wishing they were around when I was a teenager! I get  breakouts now as an adult and nothing has worked as well as Dreamdots.</li>
    <li> These really work and within putting them on the first 8 hours!! I had a huge cystic pimple that I irritated and burnt by putting a ACV, lemon and green tea paste on it that it had a dark brownish red layer of blistered skin on top.  I was ready to try and peel off the layer but my order was going to arrive at any time so I held off.  I got the dots and put them on at 11am and kept it on until 8pm and the cystic pimple went down flat and the dark blistered skin was light pink and soft and it was healed!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it! I was so skeptical and suffered from my cystic pimples for a week getting one after the other and bought so many things to put on them but not only didn&#x27;t work but made my breakout worse!  Nothing worked accept these miracle dream dots!! I originally bought one pack and had them delivered overnight but had to buy 2 more packs because I do not want to be without them in case I have another cystic breakout. Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did and make sure to buy more than one packet! Believe me you will be amazed at what these dream dots do.  I was!</li>
    <li> They work! And I really appreciate how much they help with keeping my damn hands off my face! Over all very pleased with my purchase. Affordable and very useful.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try Dream Dots Treatment Patches for Breakouts.  I don&#x27;t have acne all over but about once a month I get 1 pimple that shows up.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting too much but I was impressed with these tiny treatment patches. They actually stay on and don&#x27;t come off while you are sleeping.  They are actually very discreet looking and look better than a flaming red white head! I think for this to work overnight with one use, the pimple has to be all the way to the surface.  If not I find that the first night, it brings it further to the surface and then finally as it is surfaced, the white head will be actually on the treatment patch. What I love best about these patches is that once they are on, you cannot pick or poke at your pimple.  It keeps me from making it worse and it heals much quicker.  I don&#x27;t think this is for people with a face full of acne but I do think it is for those occasional breakouts and it works great for that! I received this product in exchange for a review. I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.</li>
    <li> I really wanted this product to work, so I hate to write this review. But I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review and I will give you just that - an honest review based on my experience with this product. They suggest you use this 4-5 days (depending on how long it takes to be effective) during the night time. I followed these instructions, and applied to clean skin. Perhaps it&#x27;s just my skin type (everyone is different) but these did not work for me. Not only did they not work....I actually developed a painful pimple as a result of using these (on a spot I had only put a dot on for one night). On the spot I did 3 nights in a row, there is actually a very light ring discoloration from the dot! I did not leave the product on for an abnormally long amount of time and the ring is hardly noticeable. Even so, it&#x27;s weird and annoying. This must be uncommon, because I can see plenty of good reviews, but this product just isn&#x27;t right for me personally.</li>
    <li> This worked good but you need a lot of dots to correct the marks</li>
    <li> This really works in absorbing acne and pimple bulges overnight. I tried this as directed, after an evening&#x27;s shower. You simply peel an adhesive dot and place over the affected area overnight and remove the following morning. It works to drastically reduce the visible red bulges. I am rating this a solid four stars (could even be 5 if priced lower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> I love it. I apply my acne spot treatment on my pimple and cover it with a dream dot. I swear it helps reduce the size of my pimple than just using m spot treatment alone. Will order again!</li>
    <li> these worked great and I will be purchasing more. Does the job overnight and clears em up!</li>
    <li> Amazing Product! I&#x27;ve always been skeptical about health product claims, so it is with great pleasure that I announce - THIS PRODUCT WORKS! It truly lives up to all of its claims as listed. The dots are transparent and when applied, cling beautifully. The best thing is that they work. It starts to work immediately on even the deepest acne (those nasty undergrounders) that lie buried beneath your skin. By morning, it will have virtually shrunk. If you have problems with pimples or acne, and want to get rid of them quick, this product is amazing. Small, transparent, waterproof, you can wear it all day and it is virtually unnoticeable. This company also backs up their claims with a 100% guarantee, so there&#x27;s nothing to loose. I love the reasonable price, the fast shipping, and the brilliance of this product that does all that it&#x27;s supposed to do. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These little dots are the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used! They make a HUGE difference with pimples and blemishes like nothing I&#x27;ve used before. There is no chemicals or medicine on the pad from what I can tell from the packaging, description, or that I can see on the dots themselves. You put one on the zit before bed and the next day it is smaller and the redness is reduced and you can see how it&#x27;s healing. In my picture you can see this huge monster zit that I had that would do nothing. It wouldn&#x27;t pop and I tried hot steam to draw the grossness out, I was using vitamin c serum to try to dry it out and get it to heal, nothing was helping. You can&#x27;t see how huge of a bump it was in the picture but this thing was ginormous and it hurt so bad that while it was forming I had been putting cold compresses on it for the pain. I used one of these dots that night and when I woke up the next morning I was in awe and really excited about these. I never expected them to work as well as they do! They seal to your skin creating like a second skin and the ooze and pus seep into the dot to be thrown away after removal. I don&#x27;t know who thought this up but they really are amazing. I also like the transparency of the dots and how it is almost completely invisible on my skin tone until a few hours when it&#x27;s absorbing the stuff. Either way it&#x27;s better than a huge nasty pimple on your face if you work with the public like I do. No one wants a waitress with a leaky gross zit touching their food! I popped one of these on right before our rush hit so at least it wasn&#x27;t unappetizing, just like a silly bandaid. I absolutely love these and will definitely be purchasing these regularly. There are 24 in a package. That is going to last us quite a while considering how fast these work! I couldn&#x27;t be more serious about my recommendation, there&#x27;s nothing else like this out there. Even my son is using them to clear up before school goes back in session.

    <li> The dots are great - they stay on really well and are hard to see, and the blemishes are flat by morning!</li>
    <li> I discovered Dream Dots a few months ago.They are fantastic! I suffer from breakouts on my chin and I tend to pick at them which always made them infected. If I feel a breakout starting I put the little patch on the spot before I go to bed and it stops me from picking it plus it heals the spot. The next morning the spot has calmed down and all the gooey stuff is absorbed into the patch .It really ,really works for me I would highly recommend Dream Dots .</li>
    <li> OMG these work so good they are now a must have item in my night time routine.</li>
    <li> Amazing curing my acne really gently, &amp;#34;will purchase again&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It worked ok. Not miraculous but it works.</li>
    <li> I just took off the dream dot and bam it&#x27;s gone !!</li>
    <li> LOVE! Keeps me from picking my acne. Only recommendation is to make sure you have it on for a long time or else it hurts when you take it off :)</li>
    <li> I tried these on a whim.  I am pleasantly surprised at how affective they are.  Place a dot on a blemish before bedtime.  It works magic as you dream away.  The next morning, you can barely see evidence of a blemish at all.  These are easy to carry, easy to pack, and they work!  Lots of stress shows up on our girlish faces...these little dots are a comfortable, painless way to treat while you sleep.  Don&#x27;t be stingy...share with the fellas!</li>
    <li> I love these! They relieved the pain and swelling and helped to dry up the pimple fast! My breakouts would usually end with me popping them causing more problems with healing and scaring. These have really helped me and I&#x27;m glad Amazon has these available!</li>
    <li> These are one of the best overnight treatments I&#x27;ve used so far! They literally work overnight. Just place one dot over the blemish and the next day it is noticeably smaller. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> yeah it works great but to much money.</li>
    <li> This product may work for some people but I have super sensitive skin. I used two patches on two different pimples. Although the patches did dry the acne, but later I developed these little painful bumps almost rash-like, which I reckon are from the glue in the patches. Now I am dealing with the painful bumps and redness. Don&#x27;t purchase these overpriced patches if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> **I received this free product to review. I was not required to write a positive review nor was I compensated in any other way. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the FTC Regulations.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dream Dots. A new treatment for the face by applying a path over the blemish overnight and then waking up to the result of an acne-free face. Is this possible? Well, after trying it for a week now, I have not had this outcome happen for me yet. The patch is 100% breathable, waterproof, and molds into your face to the point where you almost forget it is there. Once applied to the acne, the patch penetrates into the skin to repair and heal the damage. The patch swells overnight and turns white so that in the morning redness and inflammation are now gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perk to this product is if applied to the acne you will not be touching it with dirty hands and oily skin and you will have a chance to leave it alone without popping or picking at it. As far as any other benefits, sadly I did not think for the price that this item was as effective as I truly hoped it would be.</li>
    <li> It does take some things out, but not all. This problem makes my pimples get worse really. Fortunately, I don&#x27;t have any pimples instead of scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My advice for people who have pimples:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Using Clinique with green case, which is moisturizing lotion+ with dump.&lt;br /&gt;  2. drink at least 8 glasses lemon water per day.&lt;br /&gt;  3. Sleep before 11 PM.&lt;br /&gt;  4. Drink green tea or OOLONG tea, this not only helps your pimples but also helps you lose your weight.( It&#x27;s better not to drink green tea when you are hungry, or when you have period, because green tea cleans your stomach, if you are hungry and drink green tea, it&#x27;s really torture your stomach, and the reason why you can&#x27;t drink green tea in the period, because green tea is cold properties, so don&#x27;t drink it while you have period.)&lt;br /&gt;  5. Don&#x27;t eat sweet things, because it will disrupt your hormone, this is one of the main reasons why teenagers have pimples. The examples are chocolate, candies and so on.&lt;br /&gt;  6. Don&#x27;t eat fried food, especially fried chicken, french fries and so on.&lt;br /&gt;  7. Do more exercise, this is really a good way to help your body.&lt;br /&gt;  8. Persa-gel with maximum strength. The brand is Clean&amp;Clear. It does help my pimples more or less.&lt;br /&gt;  That&#x27;s all my advice, the real reason people who have pimples are disrupting hormone, irregular eating habits which cause your stomach get tired, and anomalous dietary habits, like sleeping time, the time you eat, etc. So, if we solve these problems, then we definitely have skin without pimples once again.</li>
    <li> These clever little patches would have changed my life if they had been available years ago when my face was plagued by intermittent stress-related breakouts.  Nowadays my skin rarely breaks out but, when it does, I now have the answer.  These small, round patches are nearly invisible once on my face and work like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using them is simple: wash the affected area, pat dry with a clean towel and apply the Dream Dot, pressing well for a few seconds.  Ideally, the patch should stay in place for eight hours (overnight works well) and I found that they are not affected by water if you decide to leave them on longer.  What I really like is that they do not contain any harsh ingredients, unlike the usual acne gels that dry up and irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find these really useful for those summertime heat spots that don&#x27;t seem to resolve.  The Dream Dots keep the area clean and literally draw out the inflammation, and next morning my skin is well on its way to repair the problem.  Sometimes it takes a second application to complete the repair, but it&#x27;s a brilliant alternative to having an ugly spot that doesn&#x27;t go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 24 patches in each packet, plenty for occasional use.  There is a trick to peeling them off the backing and, after a few tries, it becomes quite easy.  Really a touch of genius.&lt;br /&gt;Test sample gratefully received to enable me to write this review.</li>
    <li> Darn Dream Dots have been a total waste. I was so looking forward to those pesky little blemishes clearing up quickly. It did not happen.</li>
    <li> Awesome product.  It absorbs all the pus and oil in the tape, so the next day it is easy to extract the pimple and almost eliminates the inflammation, and when the pimple is not that serious, it erases it overnight.</li>
    <li> These are nice patches to put over pimples, spots, and similar blemishes overnight. When I tried it, my blemish was much better in the morning although there was still a red spot there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you will like these if you don&#x27;t expect magic. That is, don&#x27;t expect your blemish to vanish overnight... instead, expect it to look better and be much farther along the healing process than it would have otherwise been... that is, expect a reduction in pain, redness, and inflammation but don&#x27;t expect the blemish to completely vanish overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, I was impressed at how unnoticeable these are. They&#x27;re not invisible but you could probably consider them less noticeable than the blemish they are covering up would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to quibble about anything, it would probably be that these seem to be rather expensive at the current price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review should I experience anything different than the above when I use it on future blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly but expensive considering the small quantity.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from acne. However I suffer from compulsive skin picking (dermatillomania), a condition which makes you pick on any little bump or imperfection on your skin (sometimes without even noticing yourself). While this condition has been much improved over the years, I still get the occasional &amp;#34;picking session&amp;#34; if I am tired, stressed or absorbed in work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been very helpful. I am a journalist and writer, and thus spend long hours writing which can be conducive of picking. If I have a little bump or imperfection I have been picking on, I put one of the &amp;#34;Dream Dots&amp;#34; on and it works like a charm; it completely stops me from picking while allowing my skin to heal. These also work very well as an overnight healing treatment for little scabs or small infected areas. The patches stay on very well and creates a moist condition which is good for healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product, especially to other &amp;#34;skin pickers.&amp;#34;</li>
