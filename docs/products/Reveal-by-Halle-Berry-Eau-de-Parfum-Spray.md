    <li> I normally do not purchase perfumes made by entertainers; so I tired it. It has a strong scent and not necessarily my cup of tea, but I gifted it to a friend and she loves the smell.

    <li> the fragancy is nice. but for me is too much little. the next time i don&#x27;t buyed</li>
    <li> I have tried many of her fragrances and this one it okay. It don&#x27;t last. I wish they would make it so they last more than a couple of hours. The price is too high for a small bottle that you spray on and a hour later you have to spray more. The bottle are pretty maybe that&#x27;s what we are paying for.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the original. Think it was fake.</li>
    <li> I love this one very much.  Both are pleasing and not overbearing.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I feel like it is a good fit for me as I like light perfumes that aren&#x27;t too fruity or flowery. I get compliments on it often and only put it on in the morning with three spritzes. I do notice that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last all day and if I&#x27;m going out after work, I will put it on again. So that would be my one complaint.</li>
