### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>We are very happy to use a shampoo with no fragrence or parabens.</li>
      <li>It cleans well, and best of all, for those with allergies, it does not contain lavender and fragrance (parfum) like</li>

      <li>Thrilled to find that I could order through Amazon.</li>
      <li>Perfect and genuinely fragrance free.</li>
      <li>But I believe it does clean the hair good</li>
      <li>I bought this out of desperation for a fragrance free cruelty free shampoo and the matching conditioner and my hair looks and feels great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great that I&#x27;m not allergic to this, but it really dries out my hair.</li>
      <li>It does also work well as a body wash, and it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce than most MCS-friendly body soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve used this shampoo for awhile now and love it.  </li>
      <li>It gives me volume and shine while keeping me safe.  </li>
      <li>I notice it more in the conditioner than the shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Whats not to love?  </li>
      <li>I found this shampoo on the internet after becoming allergic to a shampoo that I had used for many years.  </li>
      <li>My hair gets pretty greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day, and this does a good job keeping it clean.</li>
      <li>No fragrance or strong chemical smells whatsoever.</li>
      <li>My grandson has severe autoimmume psoriasis and this hair product works great by cleaning and soothing skin without major irration.</li>
      <li>product works fine for me, and it may work for you as well</li>
      <li>This shampoo works on all hair types, and my hair feels smooth, light, and looks shiny.</li>
      <li>The JASON - Fragrance Free Shampoo does not contains any parabens, phthalates, or sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate (SLS).</li>
      <li>My hair dresser said that I have a lot of build up in my hair, so maybe this doesn&#x27;t clean it &amp;#34;professionally&amp;#34; but she also thought that there weren&#x27;t any chemicals in salon-brand shampoo, either....</li>
      <li>clean, unscented hair is what you&#x27;ll get when  u buy this.</li>
      <li>The cleaning process strips out oil with the dirt (otherwise, it couldn&#x27;t get your hair clean), then the conditioner replaces the stripped oils without adding dirt.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many fragrances and have been very pleased with the cleaning this product provides for my long hair and the fact that it has been reliable in not triggering my allergies.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit cheaper to buy it from Amazon rather than making a special trip to a organic food type of store.</li>
      <li>We were so glad to find these at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>We found this in a natural food store and she really liked it and how well it worked.  </li>
      <li>So, all in all, this shampoo is not bad.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free, Gluten Free, and a decent price!  </li>
      <li>I do recommend giving your hair a break once a week from it though, it really strips out your natural oils, does almost too good of a job sometimes.</li>
      <li>I can attest that this shampoo is really fragrance free.  </li>
      <li>My family members loved it so much that they happily ditched the shampoos they were using, including one expensive salon brand.</li>
      <li>highly recommended; Jason Fragrance Free Conditioner.</li>
      <li>It was a necessity to wear this fragrance free shampoo because a lot of the individuals tested in that facility were sensitive to any fragrances (shampoo on hair, soap/lotions on body, perfumes, laundry detergent on clothing).</li>
      <li>This shampoo cleans really well!</li>
      <li>, as others have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t go very far if your hair is super oily.  </li>
      <li>and I really like this shampoo.</li>
      <li>If you use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip out oil, it is probably not getting your hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is totally fragrance free</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair fairly light, but there&#x27;s still some&lt;br /&gt;kind of film left over.</li>
      <li>This shampoo really gets the job done without the pesky, unnatural fragrances.</li>
      <li>and I love that the bottle balances upside down</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I am highly allergic to any fragrance in products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll take a little unnoticeable build-up in the name of using something that&#x27;s better for me.</li>
      <li>but it does require a decent squeeze--and the opener for the top requires a really firm push.  </li>
      <li>While everyone with a form of MCS has different reactions to products, I would say that this is definitely worth a try.</li>
      <li>And I personally think that a fragrance free shampoo is a necessity when you visit medical or health facilities so that the patients in those facilities and their health don&#x27;t get compromised.</li>
      <li>The first time in ten years Ive enjoyed a Jason shampoo, in the past I found them to be too viscous and sticky.</li>
      <li>It get&#x27;s 2 stars for being all natural, I imagine it works just fine on short hair, but if you have long hair</li>
      <li>I was first introduced to Jason fragrance free daily shampoo early last year (2010) when I was tested for allergies at the Environmental Health Center in Dallas, Texas.</li>
      <li>Billed as \\&quot;PURE NATURAL\\&quot; and not containing \\&quot;sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates,\\&quot; the third listed ingredient is, nevertheless, \\&quot;sodium myreth sulfate,\\&quot; a chemically-derived surfactant.</li>
      <li>Neither natural nor not a sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Jason shampoo is free of Parabens, harsh chemicals, dyes, and fragrance.</li>
      <li>I am a natural blond, almost platinum and</li>
      <li>And the fragrance washes completely out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This shampoo just doesn&#x27;t seem to go far.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my kids because it&#x27;s less expensive than most of the more natural kid shampoos.</li>
      <li>(By the way, if you need to go to one of the world&#x27;s top facilities to get tested to see if you are sensitive to pollens, molds, metals, dust, food, chemicals, air, water, electromagnetic sensitivity, fabrics, or are the victim of disasters such as oil spills, etc., go get tested and see Dr. William J. Rea at the Environmental Health Center in Dallas.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shampoo itself that causes it, or the fact that I&#x27;m having trouble getting all of my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is gentle enough that I can use it daily without damaging my hair.  </li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo to use for the whole family, something natural, without harsh ingredients or fragrance, and gentle enough for my two girls.  </li>
      <li>I buy it because it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of regular shampoo.</li>
      <li>One has ultra fine straight hair, the other has thick curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I have multiple chemical sensitivities - looking for products that i;m not &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; to.&lt;br /&gt; jason fragrance free left my hair soft and healthy but I was sick for days after using it.</li>
      <li>My daughter can not use certain shampoos due to the coloring and fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Anyways, after that experience, as a habit I&#x27;ve used this shampoo each time I go to any medical visit (doctor&#x27;s office or hospital) because a lot of people in medical facilities are sensitive to fragrances.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that this is a problem with all the MCS-safe shampoos I&#x27;ve found, so I definitely don&#x27;t consider it a major problem.  </li>
      <li>I really want to like this shampoo, but it is very difficult to clean my hair with it, which is the whole point of a shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I vividly remember watching, with other individuals waiting to be tested, a young male patient fainting in the hall of the facility because he smelled traces of detergent, shampoo, etc.</li>

<li> Note that the John Masters Organics line of products is approximately 3.5× more expensive than the JASON brand, though you might be able to get a small discount if you buy directly from their site.&lt;br</li>
<li> My only issue has been reliably finding this product (found it originally in a store, then they went to only carrying &amp;#34;all natural products&amp;#34; that were scented with natural floral fragrances, which is useless for someone with pollen allergies!).  </li>
<li> I also had a hard time with the first bottle I opened.</li>
<li> I had to get back into the shower and wash it again with a different shampoo after realizing during the blow dry phase that my hair was still oily.  </li>
<li> Many fragrance free products I have tried left my hair dry and smelled horrible.</li>
<li> I have hair that goes just past my shoulder and live with a guy with short hair, and we go through about a bottle per month.</li>
<li> I have rather long hair</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll use it every other day with a different type of shampoo but can&#x27;t use this everyday because of how it strips my hair&#x27;s natural oils.</li>
<li> Although the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather the same as other brands.</li>
<li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my dry skin use it almost every day</li>
<li> After using this shampoo about 3x a week for two months, my hair has been dry and brittle, and both of my daughters have had dreadlock type of tangles!  </li>
<li> I have shampooed the day before, but only lather up once...still not clean.  </li>
<li> I have very thick, naturally curly hair that can become very dry and frizzy if not cared for properly.  </li>
<li> The consistency is very loose like water so its tricky to get it on your hair.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t carefully look at the ingredients before purchasing.</li>
<li> I cannot tolerate any shampoos from off the shelf in the stores due to their inherent chemicals which are fragrance or petroleum-based (extreme chemical sensitivity here).</li>
<li> I cannot use any other shampoo due to my fragrance sensitivities.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried other fragrance-free shampoos but each of them either make me break out</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past several years, since discovering that I have chemical/fragrance sensitivities and am thankful this product is on the market.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I saw this shampoo at grocery outlet, thought I&#x27;d give it a go.  I have rather long hair and I was disappointed at hour much I had to use just to get it all.  This shampoo just doesn&#x27;t seem to go far.  My hair is also suddenly horribly tangled.  I got tangles before, but nothing like this! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shampoo itself that causes it, or the fact that I&#x27;m having trouble getting all of my hair clean.  I will not be purchasing this again. It get&#x27;s 2 stars for being all natural, I imagine it works just fine on short hair, but if you have long hair I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
    <li> I think this is a good shampoo. I buy it because it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals of regular shampoo. I think it does a good job cleaning my hair. My hair gets pretty greasy if I don&#x27;t wash it every day, and this does a good job keeping it clean. I don&#x27;t notice it drying my hair out or anything. My hair dresser said that I have a lot of build up in my hair, so maybe this doesn&#x27;t clean it &amp;#34;professionally&amp;#34; but she also thought that there weren&#x27;t any chemicals in salon-brand shampoo, either....I&#x27;ll take a little unnoticeable build-up in the name of using something that&#x27;s better for me.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleans really well! No fragrance or strong chemical smells whatsoever.

My family members loved it so much that they happily ditched the shampoos they were using, including one expensive salon brand. While everyone with a form of MCS has different reactions to products, I would say that this is definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist for my dry skin use it almost every day</li>
    <li> This shampoo really gets the job done without the pesky, unnatural fragrances. Although the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather the same as other brands.</li>
    <li> I have perfume allergies and I really like this shampoo. I&#x27;ve used it for years. It&#x27;s a bit cheaper to buy it from Amazon rather than making a special trip to a organic food type of store.</li>
    <li> why do they have to put sodium laurel sulfate in every bottle&lt;br /&gt;of shampoo? It leaves the hair fairly light, but there&#x27;s still some&lt;br /&gt;kind of film left over.</li>
    <li> Billed as \\&quot;PURE NATURAL\\&quot; and not containing \\&quot;sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates,\\&quot; the third listed ingredient is, nevertheless, \\&quot;sodium myreth sulfate,\\&quot; a chemically-derived surfactant. Neither natural nor not a sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works fine for me, and it may work for you as well - I haven&#x27;t had any skin reactions, and sodium myreth sulfate is gentler than SLS/SLES. However, I have been trying to take sulfates out of my life, and now feel cheated with the labeling of this product. I didn&#x27;t carefully look at the ingredients before purchasing. Caveat emptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to avoid surfactants, you best bet is getting a true sulfate-free product like John Masters Organics. Note that the John Masters Organics line of products is approximately 3.5× more expensive than the JASON brand, though you might be able to get a small discount if you buy directly from their site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a primer on the difference between Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES), Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS), and Sodium Myreth Sulfate, see the following (I am not associated with the site below):&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Perfect and genuinely fragrance free. The first time in ten years Ive enjoyed a Jason shampoo, in the past I found them to be too viscous and sticky. I bought this out of desperation for a fragrance free cruelty free shampoo and the matching conditioner and my hair looks and feels great. Im vey pleased!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great that I&#x27;m not allergic to this, but it really dries out my hair. I&#x27;ll use it every other day with a different type of shampoo but can&#x27;t use this everyday because of how it strips my hair&#x27;s natural oils. I also had a hard time with the first bottle I opened. There was a defect in the cap and so I have to unscrew it to get to the shampoo. Wish I had just tried one bottle rather than spring for 3.</li>
    <li> If you have MCS, please keep in mind that everyone&#x27;s MCS is different, so you should just start with one bottle.  It does also work well as a body wash, and it&#x27;s cheaper per ounce than most MCS-friendly body soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight scent to it, but it seems to be a result of the ingredients and not an additional fragrance.  I notice it more in the conditioner than the shampoo.  I was really worried about it, but it hasn&#x27;t made me sick in the three years I&#x27;ve been using this.  I prefer a slight scent from the ingredients over a masking fragrance (those always make me ill).  And the fragrance washes completely out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does a good job of controlling dandruff.  Just give it time (a couple of weeks of daily washings FOLLOWED BY the conditioner) and you should notice a dramatic reduction in dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does strip the oils out of your hair, but that&#x27;s why you are supposed to use the conditioner.  Shampoo alone will not do the job.  The cleaning process strips out oil with the dirt (otherwise, it couldn&#x27;t get your hair clean), then the conditioner replaces the stripped oils without adding dirt.  If you use a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t strip out oil, it is probably not getting your hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as others have pointed out, it doesn&#x27;t go very far if your hair is super oily.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that this is a problem with all the MCS-safe shampoos I&#x27;ve found, so I definitely don&#x27;t consider it a major problem.  I have hair that goes just past my shoulder and live with a guy with short hair, and we go through about a bottle per month.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo to use for the whole family, something natural, without harsh ingredients or fragrance, and gentle enough for my two girls.  After using this shampoo about 3x a week for two months, my hair has been dry and brittle, and both of my daughters have had dreadlock type of tangles!  One has ultra fine straight hair, the other has thick curly hair.  I&#x27;ve literally had to cut the tangles out, even after applying loads of conditioner.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is so unscented I had to look at it to check that it wasn&#x27;t water!&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s unscented, and my wife is extremely happy! She is allergic to&lt;br /&gt;all sorts of perfume. Now she doesn&#x27;t feel dizzy in the shower and her hair looks great!&lt;br /&gt;Also highly recommended; Jason Fragrance Free Conditioner.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve used this shampoo for awhile now and love it.  clean, unscented hair is what you&#x27;ll get when  u buy this.</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to Jason fragrance free daily shampoo early last year (2010) when I was tested for allergies at the Environmental Health Center in Dallas, Texas. It was a necessity to wear this fragrance free shampoo because a lot of the individuals tested in that facility were sensitive to any fragrances (shampoo on hair, soap/lotions on body, perfumes, laundry detergent on clothing). I vividly remember watching, with other individuals waiting to be tested, a young male patient fainting in the hall of the facility because he smelled traces of detergent, shampoo, etc. (By the way, if you need to go to one of the world&#x27;s top facilities to get tested to see if you are sensitive to pollens, molds, metals, dust, food, chemicals, air, water, electromagnetic sensitivity, fabrics, or are the victim of disasters such as oil spills, etc., go get tested and see Dr. William J. Rea at the Environmental Health Center in Dallas. Dr. Rea and his staff are great, and they will try their best to help you and they will create antigens for your particular environmental sensitivities). Anyways, after that experience, as a habit I&#x27;ve used this shampoo each time I go to any medical visit (doctor&#x27;s office or hospital) because a lot of people in medical facilities are sensitive to fragrances. Personally, I now like this shampoo. This Jason shampoo is free of Parabens, harsh chemicals, dyes, and fragrance. This shampoo works on all hair types, and my hair feels smooth, light, and looks shiny. So, all in all, this shampoo is not bad. And I personally think that a fragrance free shampoo is a necessity when you visit medical or health facilities so that the patients in those facilities and their health don&#x27;t get compromised.</li>
    <li> My daughter can not use certain shampoos due to the coloring and fragrance.  We found this in a natural food store and she really liked it and how well it worked.  Unfortunately it was really expensive.  We were so glad to find these at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I can attest that this shampoo is really fragrance free.  I am highly allergic to any fragrance in products.  I found this shampoo on the internet after becoming allergic to a shampoo that I had used for many years.  I have very thick, naturally curly hair that can become very dry and frizzy if not cared for properly.  This shampoo is gentle enough that I can use it daily without damaging my hair.  I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> My son uses this because other shampoos and hair care products dries his skin out on his face.  This has worked great for him.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free, Gluten Free, and a decent price!  Whats not to love?  I am a natural blond, almost platinum and I am allergic to fragrance and I have Celiacs disease.  Finding a shampoo that fit my budget and made my hair shine was nearly impossible.  This shampoo and conditioner is amazing!  It gives me volume and shine while keeping me safe.  I do recommend giving your hair a break once a week from it though, it really strips out your natural oils, does almost too good of a job sometimes.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo and its companion conditioner for my cashmere sweaters, and I like the results.  For my hair, I use color-safe shampoo!</li>
    <li> Got this for my kids because it&#x27;s less expensive than most of the more natural kid shampoos. It is totally fragrance free and I love that the bottle balances upside down - so you can get every drop out at the end of teh bottle! We use it with a scented conditioner so they have a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Many fragrance free products I have tried left my hair dry and smelled horrible. This has a pleasing scent and works great for my hair!</li>
    <li> The consistency is very loose like water so its tricky to get it on your hair. It does not lather good at all. But I believe it does clean the hair good and it does not have any fragrance whatsoever.</li>
    <li> My grandson has severe autoimmume psoriasis and this hair product works great by cleaning and soothing skin without major irration.</li>
    <li> I have multiple chemical sensitivities - looking for products that i;m not &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; to.&lt;br /&gt; jason fragrance free left my hair soft and healthy but I was sick for days after using it.</li>
    <li> I cannot use any other shampoo due to my fragrance sensitivities. This is the only shampoo that does not cause me to break out and/or become rashy. I&#x27;ve tried other fragrance-free shampoos but each of them either make me break out and/or cause my face to become inflamed. I&#x27;ve been using this for the past several years, since discovering that I have chemical/fragrance sensitivities and am thankful this product is on the market.</li>
    <li> However, the container is rigid as other reviewers have warned.  I have little routine getting it to come out but it does require a decent squeeze--and the opener for the top requires a really firm push.  The product works well and I expect to order it again.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to many fragrances and have been very pleased with the cleaning this product provides for my long hair and the fact that it has been reliable in not triggering my allergies.  My only issue has been reliably finding this product (found it originally in a store, then they went to only carrying &amp;#34;all natural products&amp;#34; that were scented with natural floral fragrances, which is useless for someone with pollen allergies!).  Thrilled to find that I could order through Amazon.</li>
    <li> The JASON - Fragrance Free Shampoo does not contains any parabens, phthalates, or sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate (SLS). It cleans well, and best of all, for those with allergies, it does not contain lavender and fragrance (parfum) like the JASON - Restorative Biotin Shampoo does.</li>
    <li> I really want to like this shampoo, but it is very difficult to clean my hair with it, which is the whole point of a shampoo.  It only works if I have washed my hair the day before and I lather with a ton of it, rinse AND repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I skip a wash day, then even shampooing three times the next day does not get the oil out.  I had to get back into the shower and wash it again with a different shampoo after realizing during the blow dry phase that my hair was still oily.  That made me mad. And late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have shampooed the day before, but only lather up once...still not clean.  Bummed.</li>
    <li> My husband and I itched a lot after a shower.  After using this shampoo we no longer itch.  We are very happy to use a shampoo with no fragrence or parabens.</li>
