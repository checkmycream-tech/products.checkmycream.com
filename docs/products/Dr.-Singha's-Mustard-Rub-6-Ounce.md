### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best massage oil you will ever use.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!!!  </li>
      <li>The smell is great and the oil is great to use.</li>
      <li>Great for aches and pains.</li>
      <li>This is a great muscle rub.&lt;br</li>
      <li>great rub for your feet when a himalayan salt stone.</li>
      <li>The smell I did not find it that pleasant...</li>
      <li>It smells good, but I can&#x27;t say it has helped reduce the swelling in my finger as I had hoped.</li>
      <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve experienced, other than analgesic patches, is Sombra gel.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
      <li>If you want something for muscle pain, there are many better preparations.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice all-around for keeping the skin nice and moisturized.</li>
      <li>This mustard rub is wonderful after a nice, hot shower - especially after a work out.  </li>
      <li>The only one who seemed to mind the smell was our cat who ran from the room after I opened the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
      <li>This makes an important difference in usability.</li>
      <li>It really is an overall nice massage oil because it&#x27;s not too hot but stays warm, and the smell is strong enough, but not as strong as other athletic ointments.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s called a mustard rub because dry mustard, the powdered stuff, is an ingredient, and is the agent that makes it warm on the skin.</li>
      <li>I like the Mustard Bath better, but this \\&quot;rub\\&quot; did well in a pinch, and it was best used after the Mustard Bath, to keep me asleep longer when I was so sick up there in that frozen wasteland.    </li>
      <li>Always been a big fan of the mustard bath, this massage oil just puts it over the top.</li>
      <li>It goes on warm, not hot, and then you have to wrap up, but the warmth will linger.</li>
      <li>really helps</li>
      <li>I highly recomend it!</li>
      <li>So I really like Dr Singha&#x27;s Mustard Rub.</li>
      <li>It really helps with my muscle/nerve pain from fibromyalgia.</li>
      <li>But it really, really works.&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  it is an oil, so rub in well.  </li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t smell like a hot dog or soft pretzel.    </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have any medical conditions or health issues , so can&#x27;t comment on that, but I find it pleasant, soothing and after hard physical activity, on those rare occasions that I need a hot soak, I like to add it to the bath.</li>
      <li>Now with a cap that can easily be opened and closed.  </li>
      <li>A high quality product.  </li>
      <li>but my wife is highly allergic to scents and this one she could not get use to.</li>
      <li>Been using this stuff on and off for a few years, mostly for sore muscles and general relief.</li>
      <li>it has something that is not so appealing at least to me...</li>
      <li>As for the mustard rub it has not done very much for me, not just a little bit</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Dr. Singha&#x27;s Mustard Rub was highly recommended by a friend with a chronic pain issue, and it seemed to help me, until I broke out with a serious rash and realized it contains lavender oil. Those with lavender allergies beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include essential oils of lavender, rosemary, marjoram, thyme, sandalwood, and mustard seed in carrier oils of sunflower, almond and mustard seed oils.</li>
    <li> I did no see Esther and the King so I can&#x27;t review it.  As for the mustard rub it has not done very much for me, not just a little bit so I will not recommend it to anyone. Sorry</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff on and off for a few years, mostly for sore muscles and general relief. I don&#x27;t really have any medical conditions or health issues , so can&#x27;t comment on that, but I find it pleasant, soothing and after hard physical activity, on those rare occasions that I need a hot soak, I like to add it to the bath. No real sweet or perfumed smell which is a big plus for me.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; muscle rub.  Put it on at night before going to bed and you will not have an ache in the morning.  I did not believe my wife (she had previously used it).  But it really, really works.&lt;br /&gt;Caution:  it is an oil, so rub in well.  It has an odor but it is very faint.  There is no strong menthol odor.  The only one who seemed to mind the smell was our cat who ran from the room after I opened the bottle!&lt;br /&gt;A great product.</li>
    <li> This is a great muscle rub.&lt;br /&gt;a great rub for your feet when a himalayan salt stone. Great for aches and pains.</li>
    <li> I avidly used this product, while sick, and working in Minneapolis, MN.  I used it when I had chills from cold and flu, and it was very comforting!  Rub lots of it into every inch of your skin (uh, the G rated parts), wrap up in flannel jammies and wool blankets, and sleep.  It&#x27;s called a mustard rub because dry mustard, the powdered stuff, is an ingredient, and is the agent that makes it warm on the skin. But the smell of Dr Singha&#x27;s Mustard Rub is closer to wintergreen. You won&#x27;t smell like a hot dog or soft pretzel.    I cannot bear Ben-gay, and as I have aged, Tiger Balm irritates my skin. So I really like Dr Singha&#x27;s Mustard Rub. It never feels cold like Icy Hot. It goes on warm, not hot, and then you have to wrap up, but the warmth will linger. I like the Mustard Bath better, but this \\&quot;rub\\&quot; did well in a pinch, and it was best used after the Mustard Bath, to keep me asleep longer when I was so sick up there in that frozen wasteland.    I think athletes would like this oil for after workout.  It really is an overall nice massage oil because it&#x27;s not too hot but stays warm, and the smell is strong enough, but not as strong as other athletic ointments.</li>
    <li> This Mustard Rub has helped my arthritic knees and hands immensely. I use it every night before bed and every morning before I get dressed.  It does wonders. I highly recomend it!</li>
    <li> It smells good, but I can&#x27;t say it has helped reduce the swelling in my finger as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I try to keep my bathroom stocked with Dr. Singha&#x27;s.  This mustard rub is wonderful after a nice, hot shower - especially after a work out.  It&#x27;s also nice all-around for keeping the skin nice and moisturized.</li>
    <li> The smell I did not find it that pleasant... it has something that is not so appealing at least to me...</li>
    <li> always helpful/soothing/pain relief felt in particular with stiff hands/fingers, nerve pain/carpul tunnel, and at other areas of the body when applied.  never want to be without inventory.!</li>
    <li> This is the best massage oil you will ever use. The smell is great and the oil is great to use.</li>
    <li> A high quality product.  Now with a cap that can easily be opened and closed.  This makes an important difference in usability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff. Always been a big fan of the mustard bath, this massage oil just puts it over the top.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much too expensive and not very effective.  If you want something for muscle pain, there are many better preparations.  The best thing I&#x27;ve experienced, other than analgesic patches, is Sombra gel.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  It really helps with my muscle/nerve pain from fibromyalgia. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> .I mix this with a clay for the bug bites on my arms... really helps</li>
    <li> I love it.  Worked wonders on my feet but my wife is highly allergic to scents and this one she could not get use to.</li>
