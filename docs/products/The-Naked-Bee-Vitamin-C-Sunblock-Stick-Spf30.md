      <li>It stays on, smells good, no weird chemicals.</li>
      <li>I used it on the top of my shoulders and chest as well as my face, and they were all fine.</li>
      <li>Strongly recommend.  </li>
      <li>We pack one for his daycare and the teachers love how easy and quick it is to put on him.</li>
      <li>A fine product..</li>
      <li>and it was very hot!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been out in the sun and have tanned a bit already, so this review is not as accurate as say,</li>
      <li>My husband had me purchase one for him too because he liked it so much.</li>
      <li>Not as big as I was expecting, but the product smells great and seems to work well.</li>
      <li>I have fair &amp; sensitive skin as do my kids.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
      <li>It applies very easily and quick enough I can cover most of her face before she runs away to play.  </li>
      <li>This product goes on smooth, easy, and clear and it WORKS!  </li>
      <li>Sweet smelling, light and natural.  </li>
      <li>This sunblock works great, fast to put on so we don&#x27;t have to hold him down.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will work fine for sun protection - just as any of the other chemical sticks they sell at Wal-Mart.  </li>
      <li>I use this face sunscreen on my toddler often in the hot, summer days.  </li>
      <li>Sold simply as a sunblock stick, it does the job and so much more.</li>
      <li>It has a mild smell that isn&#x27;t overbearing, I actually quite enjoy it and find it somewhat soothing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen as it goes on clear, but does a nice job protecting the kiddos&#x27; sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Due to so many reviews saying it didn&#x27;t contain any chemicals, I ordered it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to apply, not greasy, long lasting.</li>
      <li>Portable for travel (no liquid restriction here!), not messy or greasy, and natural ingredients make it 4 stars.</li>
      <li>I use it every day around my eyes to keep the skin soft -- at this point the sunblock proerties are a bonus.</li>
      <li>This is lightweight and natural.  </li>
      <li>The only problem is applying it too much can get greasy, and it clogged my pores up a bit if I used it without making use of cleansing wipes between applications.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although expensive for the size, I love the convenience and that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, it was solid, I didn&#x27;t get burned or tanned this summer, which is really all I can ask for in a product like this.</li>
      <li>We live in high altitude, so sunscreen is essential every single day.  </li>
      <li>Unlike some natural sunscreen, this product and all of Naked Bees sunscreens do not turn your skin white.  </li>
      <li>Also, I like that it does not dry out if the kiddos accidentally leave the lid off.  </li>
      <li>The only con we have is that my little one thinks it&#x27;s funny to do his eyebrows, which ends up looking quite funky because it looks like he smears wax on them.  </li>

<li> She has only endured one small sunburn on her cheeks this summer using this sunscreen.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> About the size of a kids glue stick. Not as big as I was expecting, but the product smells great and seems to work well. It&#x27;s a bit waxy/greasy. Wish it was a bit bigger and a little cheaper. Will likely buy again.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product highly enough.    Sold simply as a sunblock stick, it does the job and so much more. I use it every day around my eyes to keep the skin soft -- at this point the sunblock proerties are a bonus. It feels wonderful and smells terrific. I&#x27;ve recommended it to all my friends and give it as stocking stuffers at Christmas. Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> My toddler (2 yr) hates having his face touched - doesn&#x27;t like lotion put on, face washed or nose wiped. This sunblock works great, fast to put on so we don&#x27;t have to hold him down. He can even put it on himself! The smell is wonderful, I even use it. We pack one for his daycare and the teachers love how easy and quick it is to put on him. Although expensive for the size, I love the convenience and that it doesn&#x27;t take up much room. Plus no worries about spilling it or having sand stuck to it.</li>
    <li> We use this for our son&#x27;s face.  It&#x27;s a great product.  It doesn&#x27;t drip and has great coverage.  Strongly recommend.  I will continue to buy this product.  We use it for ourselves as well.  Doesn&#x27;t give you that grey look that liquid sunblock can give.</li>
    <li> We used this on a trip so we wouldn&#x27;t have to pack another liquid and it was very effective in southeast Asia so I am sure it will work anywhere. I always carry one in my gym bag now as well. Easy to apply, not greasy, long lasting. A fine product..</li>
    <li> Sweet smelling, light and natural.  I use to use Neutrogena, but learned they have stuff in it that is not good for your health.  This is lightweight and natural.  Love the citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, works great!! Didn&#x27;t clog my pores!!</li>
    <li> I wish they had listed the ingredients here.  I even tried to find all the ingredients online but couldn&#x27;t.  Due to so many reviews saying it didn&#x27;t contain any chemicals, I ordered it.  Unfortunately this is not a mineral (chemical-free) sunblock.  It contains the following:&lt;br /&gt;Avobenzone 3%&lt;br /&gt;Homosalate 15%&lt;br /&gt;Octisalate  5%&lt;br /&gt;Octocrylene 10%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it will work fine for sun protection - just as any of the other chemical sticks they sell at Wal-Mart.  I&#x27;ll try to find another mineral sunstick here on Amazon that lists all ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have fair &amp; sensitive skin as do my kids.  We swear by this stuff.  It stays on, smells good, no weird chemicals.</li>
    <li> Have not used yet but if like the sunscreen should again be great!</li>
    <li> Applies easily, smells good and protects well.</li>
    <li> I use this face sunscreen on my toddler often in the hot, summer days.  It applies very easily and quick enough I can cover most of her face before she runs away to play.  She has only endured one small sunburn on her cheeks this summer using this sunscreen.  To the sunscreens defense, we were outside all day on the beach and it was very hot!  I&#x27;m pretty sure no one in my group (8 of us) made it home un-burned.  This absorbs well into the skin (because it is a chemical sunscreen, not a sunblock) and does not leave a greasy texture.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a sunscreen that didn&#x27;t go on ghostly white, so mineral sunscreens were o-u-t, OUT. This one&#x27;s nice and goes on smooth. It has a mild smell that isn&#x27;t overbearing, I actually quite enjoy it and find it somewhat soothing. The only problem is applying it too much can get greasy, and it clogged my pores up a bit if I used it without making use of cleansing wipes between applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, it was solid, I didn&#x27;t get burned or tanned this summer, which is really all I can ask for in a product like this. I&#x27;d totally buy it again.</li>
    <li> I use this to keep a foot tattoo from being exposed in the tanning bed. Perfect! I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Portable for travel (no liquid restriction here!), not messy or greasy, and natural ingredients make it 4 stars. I&#x27;ve been out in the sun and have tanned a bit already, so this review is not as accurate as say, my fair-skinned friend using it and reviewing it. I used it on the top of my shoulders and chest as well as my face, and they were all fine. It&#x27;s not as convenient for larger areas but the compactness is wonderful. It works on lips, and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Unlike some natural sunscreen, this product and all of Naked Bees sunscreens do not turn your skin white.  This product goes on smooth, easy, and clear and it WORKS!  Love all of their products!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen as it goes on clear, but does a nice job protecting the kiddos&#x27; sensitive skin.  We live in high altitude, so sunscreen is essential every single day.  I spent a couple days teaching my 5 and 8 year old how to use it and now they put it on their faces, ears, and back of their necks every morning (if wearing long sleeves) as part of the morning routine.  Also, I like that it does not dry out if the kiddos accidentally leave the lid off.  The only con we have is that my little one thinks it&#x27;s funny to do his eyebrows, which ends up looking quite funky because it looks like he smears wax on them.  My husband had me purchase one for him too because he liked it so much.</li>
    <li> it fits in my purse and yet is a chubby size so lasting a long time.  Love it!  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;re going to Hawaii on vacation and this sunblock stick will allow me to carry extra&lt;br /&gt;sun protection everywhere because of its small size. It&#x27;s also my intention to pack necessary&lt;br /&gt;items with as little weight as possible to avoid extra luggage charges yet provide us&lt;br /&gt;the protection we might need - this seemed perfect.</li>
