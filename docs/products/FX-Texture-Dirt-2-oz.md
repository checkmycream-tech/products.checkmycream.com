      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
      <li>And just like it says, it does make your hair look like you haven&#x27;t washed it in a day- for the better.     </li>
      <li>stuff is like magic.</li>
      <li>I found it once years ago and have been searching for more ever since.     </li>
      <li>Glad I could find it on-line through Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>

      <li>Good first impression, since it let me effortlessly keep them to the side without any greasy look or feel.</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the fine print.</li>
      <li>This stuff creates volume, texture, gives your hair nice definition, its super light, not greasy, has a satin finish.</li>
      <li>Looked all around locally and could not find it, thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t being made any more then found on Amazon so happy to find.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not super impressed with this paste.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>Its totally different and unique, and its the one and only best.    </li>
      <li>It is 18 dollars in China to buy on Tao Bao, so it&#x27;s worth buying it every year</li>
      <li>The smell also faded pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice it after I applied it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very cautious when trying new products since I&#x27;ve found that most hair products used for taming hair either don&#x27;t work at all or make my hair look and feel greasy (</li>
      <li>But it goes on so easily, and sort of disappears into the hair, but leaving great texture and fullness behind.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, frizzy, naturally blonde hair.</li>
      <li>Debated on this, but glad I went with it, great product for piecing hair and taming it down some after you blow dry and it doesn&#x27;t add a lot of weight!</li>
      <li>And so many are all the same.</li>
      <li>My hair is about 1.5&amp;#34; long on top and shorter on the sizes.</li>
      <li>If you are using some sort of texture product, I very highly recommend trying Texture Dirt.  </li>
      <li>Too bad I cannot get this through Wallgreens any more - it&#x27;s a great hair product.  </li>
      <li>It just made my hair sticky and didn&#x27;t give me much control.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t really give me the hold I wanted.</li>
      <li>Most are just a gooey glob that makes your hair feel wet and doesn&#x27;t give you the volume you need.</li>
      <li>By the time I was ready to use them</li>
      <li>I am absolutely stunned how well this product works.</li>
      <li>I came across this without even really looking for it and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much product</li>
      <li>my mistake, but you can absolutely get it cheaper.</li>
      <li>Its fairly thick and has a good hold.  </li>
      <li>If you do go a day or two without washing, you hair looks great, but there&#x27;s parts in the back that you can&#x27;t control, it falls flat later in the day, and your scalp gets itchy.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I have tried pretty much every brand off the shelves of walgreens/ cvs and even ordered &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; products online such as hanz de fuko and none compare to this.</li>
      <li>I live in the Pacific NW, and the rain here makes the frizz out of control.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s in new packaging, so perhaps its once again being manufactured.  </li>
      <li>Lightweight, decent hold, re-formable, and when you put it in your hair your hair maintains its natural texture and appearance (no shine or helmet look like with gel).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hard to find, and I was thrilled when I found it.  </li>
      <li>Regardless of what length I currently am wearing my hair, I find using some texturizing paste is really helpful.  </li>
      <li>on my blonde hair, oily products make my hair look much darker).</li>
      <li>and there was an unexpected rain storm...</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s half the price of any other worthwhile product I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;Please never discontinue this product...</li>
      <li>Amazon is fantastic for finding hard to find products.  </li>
      <li>It is definitely a good messy, dirty head paste, ESPECIALLY for the price (which, at most drugstores is half of what it is on here -</li>
      <li>Little more expensive but worth the money</li>
      <li>I thought it would be too heavy when I first rubbed it on my hands to use on my hair.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this stuff. I found it once years ago and have been searching for more ever since.     This is the perfect gel/pomade to give you volume and styling control without any of the gooeyness or glueiness of all the others. And just like it says, it does make your hair look like you haven&#x27;t washed it in a day- for the better.     If you do go a day or two without washing, you hair looks great, but there&#x27;s parts in the back that you can&#x27;t control, it falls flat later in the day, and your scalp gets itchy. This is the way to get around that. All the style and hold with none of the grossness of having not washed.     I highly recommend this. I&#x27;ve been buying and trying hair gels for the last 12 years. Most are just a gooey glob that makes your hair feel wet and doesn&#x27;t give you the volume you need. And so many are all the same. Even if a hair gel says \\&quot;max hold\\&quot; or \\&quot;ultra volume\\&quot; I find them all to be the same weak glue that makes my hair look like a wet cat. Even the pomades of thicker consistency end up with the same effect. But this stuff is what you are looking for. Its totally different and unique, and its the one and only best.    Buy more than one to save on shipping, and you&#x27;ll want more. One little tub lasts me about a month, and you don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair product ever. I&#x27;ve used gel, wax and other pastes, including American Crew. My hair is about 1.5&amp;#34; long on top and shorter on the sizes. This stuff lets me style however I want without being visible or too firm or weak. It&#x27;s a perfect blend in the middle and hope they never discontinue this product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This stuff is IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND but better than EVERYTHING ELSE OUT THERE. NOTHING COMPARES. NOTHING. No shine, no goey crap, doesn&#x27;t make your hair stick together.</li>
    <li> I have used FX Texture Dirt for several years and its WAS the best product of its kind. I have been buying it at Walgreen for several years, however they have discontinued it. I just bought a case of 6 on line. Apparently FX has changed the formula for Texture Dirt, now it leaves a greasy mess on the hair. I will not reorder this product. I have switched to a another product and I have 5 bottles of Texture Dirt that I guess I will throw away.</li>
    <li> When my hair needs a lift, this gives it, particularly at that awkward stage when it&#x27;s grown out but isn&#x27;t quite long enough to get a haircut.  Also, it really helps me put my hair where I want it when I get up in the morning after sleeping on it wrong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not super impressed with this paste. It didn&#x27;t really give me the hold I wanted. I Emma woman with short hair and wanted to give it a slightly tousled look. It just made my hair sticky and didn&#x27;t give me much control. Also, it&#x27;s got a slightly rubbery type of feel. Not sure what the hype is about. I tried L&#x27;Oreal studio line overworked hair putty and prefer it over this stuff.</li>
    <li> Great, best hair styling product I have tried so far. Lightweight, decent hold, re-formable, and when you put it in your hair your hair maintains its natural texture and appearance (no shine or helmet look like with gel). This paste is essentially invisible in hair.</li>
    <li> Love this item.  Looked all around locally and could not find it, thought maybe it wasn&#x27;t being made any more then found on Amazon so happy to find.  It works great on fine hair to add volume and texture.</li>
    <li> bought it because of the reviews---  smells terrible and didn&#x27;t work at all-</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  This was my every day paste for a while until I changed my style to the &amp;#34;Ivy League&amp;#34; cut recently.  Its fairly thick and has a good hold.  I noticed almost no scent, which isn&#x27;t bad, but I like a strongly scented product.  It is definitely a good messy, dirty head paste, ESPECIALLY for the price (which, at most drugstores is half of what it is on here - but lately I haven&#x27;t seen it).  You can mix it with a little water based pomade for extra shine or use it as a stand alone product.  If and when I decide to do the messy look again, I will keep this on hand.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely stunned how well this product works. I have tried pretty much every brand off the shelves of walgreens/ cvs and even ordered &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; products online such as hanz de fuko and none compare to this. Guys seriously this stuff will work wonders for your hair. I&#x27;m a guy and I have the type of hair that is really thick and picky when it comes to putting product in it. This stuff creates volume, texture, gives your hair nice definition, its super light, not greasy, has a satin finish. Excellent for longer hair or grown out hair. Don&#x27;t let the brand name fool you. I know a lot of people out there that go by brand name and reputation only. Will buy more when time comes.</li>
    <li> I have very fine, frizzy, naturally blonde hair. I live in the Pacific NW, and the rain here makes the frizz out of control. On days when I wash my hair, I HAVE to put product in my hair to manage it after straightening. It doesn&#x27;t take much product and I&#x27;ve been using the same sculpting putty for a couple of years now. Now that I&#x27;ve run low, I can&#x27;t find the same stuff ANYWHERE. I&#x27;m very cautious when trying new products since I&#x27;ve found that most hair products used for taming hair either don&#x27;t work at all or make my hair look and feel greasy (on my blonde hair, oily products make my hair look much darker). So, after receiving Amazon gift cards for Christmas, I started looking all over the site for what to buy. I came across this without even really looking for it and decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I received it today and put just a small amount in my bangs to keep them out of my face and straight. Good first impression, since it let me effortlessly keep them to the side without any greasy look or feel. It smells more masculine to me, which was a little off putting, but smell is pretty much at the bottom of my checklist for hair products (so long as it doesn&#x27;t smell terrible!) The smell also faded pretty quickly and I didn&#x27;t notice it after I applied it. After being out all day, I went out tonight and there was an unexpected rain storm... I&#x27;m talking BUCKETS of rain out here. Even through standing outside (covered, but the wind was blowing rain onto me) and walking to and from my car, MY BANGS HELD UP!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like magic. I was shocked that I came back with my hair looking very much like it did when I left (or my bangs anyway... My ponytail was another story entirely). AND it&#x27;s half the price of any other worthwhile product I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;Please never discontinue this product... It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> why pay 3x the price.&lt;br /&gt;this works just like J Anton Dirt and a quarter of the price.&lt;br /&gt;i have tried them both</li>
    <li> bought this from Good Buy NY, paid $22.99 for 1.  Thought I was getting 2, my mistake, but you can absolutely get it cheaper. Make sure you read the fine print.</li>
    <li> Works awesome on my short spiky hair.  Even better than the FX pliable wax.  Little more expensive but worth the money</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds of hair paste. This kind works best with my hair (fine). I also use their hair wax product (green container).</li>
    <li> I have fine hair.  Regardless of what length I currently am wearing my hair, I find using some texturizing paste is really helpful.  I&#x27;ve used many types, and picked this one up off a clearance table at Walgreens when they were out of the L&#x27;Oreal product I was using.  Texture Dirt is fabulous!  I thought it would be too heavy when I first rubbed it on my hands to use on my hair.  But it goes on so easily, and sort of disappears into the hair, but leaving great texture and fullness behind.  It&#x27;s very hard to find, and I was thrilled when I found it.  Amazon is fantastic for finding hard to find products.  If you are using some sort of texture product, I very highly recommend trying Texture Dirt.  The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> If you want spike-y, shaky looking hair - this is the product.  Too bad I cannot get this through Wallgreens any more - it&#x27;s a great hair product.  Glad I could find it on-line through Amazon.com.  The vendor shipped the product extremely fast - great service!</li>
    <li> Three of the 6 jars were dried out. By the time I was ready to use them I no longer had the receipt to return them.</li>
    <li> I used to be able to find this on Walgreen&#x27;s shelves...now I have to order it on line BUT the hope is...it&#x27;s in new packaging, so perhaps its once again being manufactured.  DIrt gives fullness to hair.  People with thinning hair will love this.</li>
    <li> I use this product almost every single day and I have yet to find anything that is remotely as good. It is 18 dollars in China to buy on Tao Bao, so it&#x27;s worth buying it every year I come home and getting 2......One will last at least a year. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Debated on this, but glad I went with it, great product for piecing hair and taming it down some after you blow dry and it doesn&#x27;t add a lot of weight! just a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
