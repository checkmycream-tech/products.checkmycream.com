<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have an afro that is diminishing fast and i have to do a sad comb over. This is the only stuff that has the GLUE power to deal with whats left of my hair. It holds it like a rock and doesn&#x27;t let me down, turn to mush when I sweat or just loose its grip after an hour!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff. I do worry about my scalp not being able to breath but this stuff works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say that stuff like this rakes in more money than a cancer appeal or famine aid . Well, sad but this is why. Its just toooo good for us vain bas#$@!^&amp;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and don&#x27;t spike my hair straight up, but my hair is about 3-4 inches long and I use ICE spiker to achieve a slightly spiked style.  I get lots of comments from women &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t get my hair to do that...what product do you use?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the best hair spiking product I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve ran the proverbial gauntlet. It&#x27;s the only thing that spikes my 11\\&quot; mohawk and holds it there for a good period. I used very little glue and managed to keep my fin perfect for up to 4 days. Expensive, ubt well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product</li>
    <li> My 16 year old son says this is the best product on the market for hair spikes and we have tried them all. He was happy to find a big tub and so was I because he is always running out and only salons have carried it.</li>
    <li> The tub will last you forever!  I had one before and it lasted for months.  Biggest draw back to the pump is that it can get pretty sloppy if you try putting it into a book bag and it isn&#x27;t properly locked down.  I&#x27;d say the coolest thing about it is that once you can&#x27;t get stuff out of the pump, you can just take the top off and grab some from inside.  I just got done with a few tubes of this stuff which lasted a long time as well, but I&#x27;m sure there was some still left over in the tubes.  Anyway, just watch the tub in transit.</li>
    <li> 5.1oz For 18$ at the Hair Salon or 16oz for 27$ on here you do the math...  I love this hairgel.  And now its affordable.</li>
    <li> Great product and was shipped on time</li>
    <li> Not for me.  The hair style that I got was not what I expected.  Superglue would have done the same job.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for 14 years now and it&#x27;s still the best.</li>
    <li> Great deal and fast shipping.  Product just as described.  Better price then in the store and delivered to your door.  What more could you ask.  This stuff rocks.  Sticky as glue or use some water to dilute.</li>
    <li> I was porchasing the 5 oz tube and it would last me no more than 2 weeks. I purchased the 16 tub in Feb. and ran out of it on wed.  Dont waste your money on the 5 oz. Buy the 16 oz tub.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my tub of glue. I bought it in June 2010, so it&#x27;ll last you about a year if you&#x27;ve got short hair. My hair tends to fluctuate between .5\\&quot; - 2.0\\&quot; depending on how long I let it go between cuts. I normally dab a bit in my hands and water it down a bit. Then I &#x27;wash&#x27; it off the hands by adding a bit more water and wiping it down all over my head.  Good stuff! It is a bit on the spiky/hard side so if you are looking for a pomade/wax, this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> My husband has stick straight hair. And there&#x27;s a lot of it. This stuff really works for keeping it in place. Nothing else he has ever tried has worked this well. Love the size of this product. It will last longer than the 150 ml bottles he has been buying.</li>
    <li> Wow!!!! I&#x27;m super impressed with this product. I use it on my 7yr old son. I&#x27;ve always kind of buzzed his head leaving it longer on the top to spike up. I&#x27;ve tried several products but mostly used hairspray to hold it. Recently, I decided I wanted to try to give him a bit more style. His hair would look nice when I dropped him off at school in the morning.... but man alive he looked like a rag-a-muffin when I picked him up 6hrs later. Not to mention the amount of hairspray I sprayed on that poor child &amp; he still came home lookin&#x27; like that. So in the back of my head I&#x27;m thinking &amp;#34;I absolutely have to find a better product.&amp;#34; &amp;#34;I know there must be better products out there.&amp;#34; I mean, I don&#x27;t know many men that spray a half a can of hairspray on themselves in the morning. So fast forward &amp; I&#x27;m sitting at the salon, I look over &amp; low &amp; behold I find this product sitting there. GLUE!!!!!! Oh yeah, now THAT&#x27;S what I need. I grab my phone &amp; go to my #1 one-stop shopping app. AMAZON!!! Not only am I able to find it here, but the price is better AND there&#x27;s a bigger size. SCORE!!!! After reading reviews I decided it was what I&#x27;d been looking for. Now with that short background story outta the way ;) let&#x27;s move on to the product. My beautiful son comes home with hair just as good-looking as it was when I last saw him. The product is definitely more easily managed with a touch of water like other reviewers have noted. I&#x27;m able to get more height to his hair if leave it dry. I rub about a 1/4 pump at a time (with a few drops water) between my hands &amp; work it that way. It does get a little flaky if you work it too much. But a few more drops of water erases them. Washes out in the shower even using baby shampoo. The 5oz tube was $10.70 +tax, locally. The 16.9oz tub with pump, on Amazon, was a bargain considering the local price &amp; how amazing it works. Thank you Amazon for another great product with competitive pricing &amp; delivery to my door uber fast. Thank you Amazon shoppers for all the great, honest &amp; insightful reviews.on shoppers for all the great, honest &amp; insightful reviews.</li>
    <li> Been using SPIKER forever it seems it is the only thing that works. Anything you can buy at a regular store is not going to compare. Try it and get hooked.</li>
    <li> I have used many products of this nature but this is by far the best to suit my needs.</li>
    <li> Best molding gel. This stuff is hard as a rock and gives your hair a nice shine too. I&#x27;m used this product for years. Pointer- make sure hair is slightly wet to help mold your hair better especially if you are using a comb</li>
    <li> Love this product. A little goes a long way so it lasts quite some time.  Does wash out easily. Great hold.</li>
    <li> Just got my package yesterday and have had a pretty good day or two with the hair gel.  First, I thought it would be bigger but it&#x27;s pretty convenient for its size.  Other than that, the hair gel does look like glue and sticks to your hair amazingly. One of the tougher things is getting the gel out of your fingers/hair when you are finished styling or taking a shower to get rid of it. This gel is pretty good, I would also recommend Got 2B Blast Freeze Spray (may not be exact name, but similar) which helps hold your hair even more. Even without the Freeze Spray, the hair gel works in doing what it says it would do on the surface: provide a fierce, strong hold. In addition, it even rained today after I was done putting gel in my hair and its water-resistance really pulled through. Not a single hair was down. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice from this seller and it always comes quickly, and is well packaged.  Neither leaked in shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spiker&#x27;s hair glue is just amazing!  I&#x27;ve been using it as my main product for 12 years.  I work a tiny bit through wet hair to work as a texturizer, as I have fine hair, and let air dry before fixing.  (This also helps as a pre-treatment for hair that won&#x27;t hold curl, or for hard-to-maintain up dos) For extra hold and a matte (not shiny) look, I wet my hair in the morning, work some through and blow dry.  For a shinier look,  a bit on the fingers with a couple drops of water.  And for water resistant insane hold, you can use it straight on your hair.  Seriously, I&#x27;ve been dunked in a pool and come up surprisingly still styled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit will work for most hair and this pump lasts you forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in a dry climate however, keep a small square of plastic wrap or something to put over the end.  I never seems to clog, but it will accumulate dry bits of hair glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Style and enjoy guys!</li>
    <li> Great value for the spiker styling glue.  The pump action is a nice touch.  Occasionally the pump gets clogged at the tip by hardened gel but overall this product hold your hair well without causing it to be crunchy.</li>
    <li> Spiker is the best styling product I have used. It remains intact until you wash it out. Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> I have unmanagable hair and Joico Ice Spiker is the only thing that keeps my hair in place. I been using it for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried the blue colored product too, and it good to use a little after using the clear as a base. The 16 oz tub makes it easy and so much more economical, sometimes its tough not to use to much. Great Porduct!</li>
    <li> This product can range drastically in price depending on vendor. I used this for the first time years ago to hold my hair and it really is a heavy duty hold, From playing sports to everyday use, does the job and is the cheapest I&#x27;ve found on Amazon. This is the product Paulie D uses from the Jersey Shore, if it can hold his crazy wild hair that way you could put a mohawk on a cat and I&#x27;m sure it would hold.. not that you would want to do that though. My go to product for hair styling.</li>
    <li> Great product but this last packaging was bad. The hair gel was opened In protective plastic and still leaked into the box. The seal was broken on it so it leaked out. I buy this product every 3 months and this is the first time I have experienced this. I am not a happy customer. A Lot of the gel leaked out into box and is no good. I feel like I wasted money.</li>
    <li> Best hair glue ever last all day long.  Would reccomend it to anyone who has stubborn hair like me :)</li>
    <li> This does exactly what I want - it let&#x27;s me shape/spike my hair and then &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; it in place. I do dilute the paste with a little bit of water so it&#x27;s easier to work with. Most of the reviews are by men but I&#x27;m a woman and use this on my semi-short, shaggy haircut.</li>
    <li> My husband will only use this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many products over the years, from \\&quot;mega-hold\\&quot; hair spray to #10 hold hair gell. They either don&#x27;t work, flake off or cause me to not want to even touch my hair during the day. Nothing really worked for my shorter hair cut (#4 on the trimmer) until I was given a bottle of this stuff.     While it looks like Elmers Glue, and just about feels like it, you use just a little, dilute it just enough and place in dry hair and your hair will not move, crust, flake or sag all day long. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth the price. A 5.1 oz tube lasted 4 months, and that included some learning days where I severely over-glued my hair. Those days, it took longer to wash my hands off than gell my hair.</li>
    <li> ive been using spiker for years and my hair hasn&#x27;t fallen out.  its best described as glue or wax.  it keeps things pointed in the right direction.  it doesnt make your hair look greasy</li>
    <li> My son and husband use this daily, took us 6 months to use this amount. Awesome price!!!! A tube cost so much more.</li>
    <li> Have bought this in the past, but decided to buy it online since I now live in a new city and don&#x27;t know where to buy it here.  A little expensive, but worth the price!</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my son and it works really well for him. keeps his hair stiff like he likes it and no flakes.</li>
    <li> Just arrived, while in shrink wrap, it had leaked and was very messy when i opened it!  Good product, but dissappointed it arrived the way it did.</li>
    <li> This was a great bargain, and it does its job very well.  Some of the best styling glue I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I use to use dep sport sculpting glue and have been looking for a replacement for years and this is the closest thing I could find now I hope they never stop making this one they have a customer for life.</li>
    <li> Perfect for thinking hair</li>
    <li> container was a lil broken which caused alot of the product to cover the container within the plastic wrapped around it but still was pretty much full and works great</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t a product I would wear everyday but it is a product I will wear on a regular basis. Much better than any gel you will find in some big retail store. This has great holding power, even on my thick Asian hair. The hold lasts all day long and my hair stays exactly how I wanted it to look in the morning even in the evening. The glue is a little hard to wash out of your hands compared to other hair products but it comes out of my hair easily in the shower. I find myself wearing this product when my hair gets on the long side and nothing else will hold it up. This isn&#x27;t a product that is going to live in my bathroom cabinet. I plan on using this tub up and purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited this long to review this product.  It can spike any style any type of hair, no matter how strong or thick or straight your hair is.  And it washes out easily in the shower.  It has a nice, subtle smell.  Great product!  Use it on wet hair for a gel look.  Use it *very* sparingly on dry hair for a messy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  a little goes a long way with this stuff.  This 16 ounce container will last forever...</li>
    <li> i like it but two things are annoying about it - first, it constantly dries up at the end of the tube making you have to clean the hard chunks everytime so that more can come out, this is also very wasteful as all that adds up overtime, second, once it does come out it dries out very very quick so you gotta be ninja-fast with it.</li>
    <li> My husband and my son love this hair gel. It&#x27;s the only brand they will use, it stays put all day. We were excited to see it in this pump, much cleaner and better way to store it without it getting all gummed up in the cap.</li>
    <li> Great product, my husband uses this styling glue and loves it. That&#x27;s why we buy it by the tub!</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband.  It&#x27;s the only product he uses and he is very particular about his hair products. It is pretty easy to use, not too thick, and does not leave any white of flaky residue.  It also keeps the style pretty much until he shampoos it out, so long lasting.  It also travels well as the pump can retract so it won&#x27;t spill during travel.  It would be awesome if they made a travel size because this doesn&#x27;t pass the airline carryon requirements so we do have to pack it in checked luggage when we travel.</li>
    <li> There isn&#x27;t anything that will spike your hair like Ice Spiker. I have tried a lot of different products and it is absolutely the BEST!</li>
    <li> My son absolutely loves the gel. It holds and it does not dry his hair and it holds. Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This product gives the best hold for my short, spiked, silver hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried others, but this works the best and the longest.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of this gel. The first one is not quite used up yet and its been 3 years already. I just bought this one so I would have an extra bottle once i ran out. Love this stuff &amp; my hair does too. Mahalo</li>
    <li> My son loves this gel and refuses to use anything else. It arrived quickly, but the pump had broken open during shipping and some of the gel had leaked out all over.</li>
    <li> A great product if you don&#x27;t want your hair to get crunchy when styling and holds for a long time.  However, this stuff doesn&#x27;t come out as easily as you might think when washing your hair and can get flakey/white if someone really rubs your head.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It works well to give my hair the volume it lacks. I highly recommend it.  GREAT!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. It&#x27;s the only hair product he will use now. It holds the hair in place extremely well. The best thing about it is that it does NOT give the hair a wet look.</li>
    <li> Keeps my cowlick-stricken hair tamed, and has a nice smell.  Easy to clean off your hands with a bit of water.  Works fine on both dry or damp hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect shipping, perfect price, perfect product.  They di a perfect jon at all.  I will recommend to all my friens... !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s the only gel/glue that allows me to do ANYTHING with my hair. Once it sets you&#x27;re good for the the day, it wont move. It&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to find locally. But now I know I can find it on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> It was such a great price and just what I needed.  The seller was a true joy to do business with--very considerate of my needs being met and being satisfied.  I really appreciate that!</li>
    <li> I love Joice Ice Spiker Glue for my coarse hair.  The tub is the best and only way to buy this stuff.  It lasts forever.  One tip is to use Kleenex to remove the excess glue every few days. This will avoid any kind of build up (not that it gets too bad anyway).</li>
    <li> very reasonable price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of this product for about 15 years. It is great if you really want your hair to stay in place. I have thick straight hair that doesn&#x27;t like to stay put without some coaxing. I&#x27;ve tried those supermarket tubs of hair gel but that stuff is weak and in a couple of hours, my hair will want to just go back to how it sits naturally. This Joico Ice Spiker glue will allow me to maintain the style I want and still wash out clean without too much effort unlike those hair waxes that I&#x27;ve tried that just stay and stay even after washing your hair a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so strong that if you dunk your head in a pool and get your hair all wet, it will for the most part still be able to keep your hair looking how you styled it as long as you don&#x27;t start running your hands through your hair or towel dry your hair. Just let your hair air dry and you&#x27;ll still be good to go. When they call it a styling glue, they aren&#x27;t over exaggerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smell but to me it&#x27;s definitely not unpleasant and it&#x27;s subtle to the point where only you and maybe someone only inches from your head will notice it. To be honest, I kind of like the smell and nobody&#x27;s ever said anything negative to me about it.</li>
    <li> Your search ends here; buy this stuff and never look back, a family member gave me a jar last year and I am now a life time fan of ICE Spiker glue. With 1-4&amp;#34; hair, &amp;#34;A dab will do ya.&amp;#34; Just spread it between your hands with a drop of water and style away. Perfection in seconds-for days (if you don&#x27;t shower, it is awesome stuff and highly water resistant). t takes longer to wash it off your hands than to apply it! I&#x27;m buying another tub right now! Hope they never change this awesome product.</li>
    <li> Ordered two of these things. One was okay the other was destroyed.  Hair gel was everywhere.  What a mess.  Will probably try and order from somebody else next time.</li>
    <li> Short hair will spike out in every direction with a small dab! I think this is the best hair glue on the market.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my friend. He can do hair-stands now. Very impressed.</li>
    <li> We always order our Ice Spiker on Amazon because it is such a great value and convenient to have it shipped right to our home. The Ice Spiker is great quality and does wonder for my husbands hair (which stands straight up without it).</li>
    <li> Although I got a spilled jar, the seller kindly sent me another one. Great gel and recommend it for anyone who loves stylingredients their hair.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! I have short hair, and I whip it out, so this product is perfect for me. Put it in your hair, put your hair where you want it, and it will stay. I ALWAYS put it in dry hair. Best product I use on my hair, along with Redkin Rewind 06. I use the rewind 06 for the back of my hair because if I use the Joico Ice Spiker, I can&#x27;t get my hair whipped back out, from being flat from sleeping on it, so this is where the Redkin Rewind 06 comes in. I use the Rewind 06 in the back of my hair, and I use Ice Spiker on the rest of my hair. I noticed people have made comments about this big size jar, the 16.9oz jar, that the spout gets clogged with the product. I put syran wrap over the spout only, and put a rubber band  on around the syran wrap, around the spout. IT WORKS!! I use my Ice Spiker everyday, and I have had this large jar for over a year, and it has NEVER clogged on me. Try it, it works!! Again, AWESOME styling glue!!</li>
    <li> This styling glue works great.  It&#x27;s not your typical &#x27;gel&#x27;.  It&#x27;s water resistant and will hold all day until you wash it out.</li>
    <li> My husband and son use it.  They like it.</li>
    <li> Son loves this stuff. :-)</li>
    <li> Best hair gel out there</li>
    <li> I believe it is the best out their.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and would&#x27;nt be without it. It&#x27;s great for spiking or making thin hair feel and appear to be thicker. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Asian so my hair only knows how to grow one way....straight.  I&#x27;ve sported a faux hawkish haircut for many years and this is the only stuff that I use.  It&#x27;s somewhat industrial, very sticky and is probably the strongest stuff I&#x27;ve ever used.  Also, it holds all day.  At the end of the day, it washes out fairly well.  When using rub in your hands or fingers a bit and apply strategically.  This isn&#x27;t hair gel our mousse, it&#x27;s a potent hair wrangler.  It doesn&#x27;t get hard and crusty like gel, so your hair feels somewhat soft but with some stiffness. This is a great product if you&#x27;ve been looking for something with real hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying the larger container for home use.  Product dispenses well, but occasionally leaves some residue at the tip that hardens.</li>
    <li> Good product and better price than any storefront</li>
    <li> My husband is a guy with thick curly hair and keeps it trim on the side with flop overlap This product works very well for him. No bad hair days. He puts a small amount on once in the am and shake. It&#x27;s good all day and into the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my review was helpful please let me know by clicking &amp;#34;YES&amp;#34; below. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend swears by this gel. It works incredibly well at holding hair, whether it&#x27;s curly and down or straight and spiked. Only down side is it tends to create some white gel flakes in the hair, but a nice combing right after applying usually solves the problem.</li>
    <li> I found out about Spiker by admiring another guy&#x27;s hair on the El downtown a few weeks ago.  His was a more sophisticated, office-friendly style; but I like to use mine to manage hair that only wants to stick straight up.  Now it does that like it means it.  You can add more or less depending on how extreme you want it.  I&#x27;d like to try out the colored &#x27;glues&#x27; as well, which would be more convenient than gloppy dye.</li>
    <li> I hope the company never stops making this product, my husband loves it.  It handles easily, styles naturally and holds exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> Great product! Awesome if u like to spike your hair.</li>
    <li> this is the 2nd time i ordered this and i&#x27;m happy to report that it was packed well. The first time, the top fell off and a bit got out (as others have mentioned). The 2nd time, i believe it was taped together or something so it stayed in one piece and no mess at all. 5 stars this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;forgot to review the actual product....i love the glue. works great, and the pump is awesome. love that i only need a little and once it gets too dry to apply, i just get a drop of water on my hands and it re-energizes it for application. Because of this, the tub lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great product, and it&#x27;s the only hair product that works on my hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 4 years....even my adult sons use it!&lt;br /&gt;Never a bad hair day when using this product!</li>
    <li> I love this gel, simple. Been using it for years now and works best with my hair. shipped fast too!</li>
    <li> This gel is the only gel that works for my boyfriends hair. He has very thick hair. VERY good price considering the amount. He uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my boyfriend&#x27;s mohawk and he just loves it!  He used to use a got2b product but he prefers this one because it holds better and it doesn&#x27;t start melting down his face and neck.  I always buy off of amazon because the price just can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> This product holds well and is water resistant. Going outdoors when it is raining or snowing, the product will still hold as long as you are not drenched. It is also does not create dry flakes or  too &amp;#34;pasty&amp;#34; in your hair. I would recommend this product and I will be continuing to use it.</li>
    <li> Love this gel. Super stiff and will stay together in bad conditions. Strongest gel in the market in my opinion</li>
    <li> Great Product, as described</li>
    <li> I bought this Icing to use on my signature cupcakes. Little did I know that this stuff needs to be microwaved prior to topping the cupcakes.</li>
    <li> Best hair glue ever made!</li>
    <li> This item is awesome! My husband will use nothing else for his spikey hair.&lt;br /&gt;But the shipping took a very long time. And when it came at long last it was oozing and covered in goo.&lt;br /&gt;I will say I&#x27;m very very glad it had been wrapped in a sealed bag so the oozing didn&#x27;t get far.</li>
    <li> i gave the Spiker 2 stars because i really like the product but when i received the product half the bottle was leaked out.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2, and when I opened up the box, there was gel that leaked out of both of the containers. They should really consider checking/tightening the top before shipping out. Not worth returning but it did make me feel a little sad inside. Otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this exact product about a two years ago .. I only need to hit the scalp once in the morning .. and not with much goo. I swear this keeps your hair exactly where it needs to be .. even after being in the ocean (for about one dip under water). It is worth every dime ..</li>
    <li> If you read my other review for the travel size you will see that I am not your typical gel user. I have frizzy hair and have tried various other products but none come close to keeping your hair intact. As the description states, this is basically a glue for your hair so that it will not move. If you want to ease it up a bit, I recommend a de-frizzing serum of some sort.</li>
    <li> I like this product because of the all day hold that no other product can offer. Though I still have the spiked hair style of the early 2000&#x27;s I like to drive with windows down on my car. This is the only hair gel that can maintain my hairstyle. The gel also easily washes out and leaves no residue on my clothes or pillows.</li>
    <li> Love this product never fails to give great hold would recommend to everyone who uses hair gel</li>
    <li> For those looking at this gel and thinking is too expensive. Let me tell you is worth every penny you pay.  I been using this gel for a long time and been told that I&#x27;m crazy for paying that much for this product.  My friends even recommended that gel call....\\&quot;Moco De Gorilla\\&quot; but it&#x27;s not the same. If you have a style that you want to do and other gel don&#x27;t hold it. Then this gel is for you. It also come off easily no special shampoo or anything like that.</li>
    <li> Very convenient pump, not a sticky mess like the squeeze tubes. Fantastic product for spiking hair.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MANAGING YOUR HAIR AND KEEPING IT IN PLACE. I HAVE SHORT HAIR, VERY MUCH LIKE A MILITARY STLYE CREW CUT. INSTEAD OF LEAVING MY HAIR WITH A FRIZZY PORCUPINE LOOK, THIS STYLING GLUE KEEPS IT LOOKING SHARP AND NEAT. IT COSTS MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE GEL, BUT WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT MOST IS THAT I FEEL SAFE AND SECURE THAT IT WONT DRY UP AND LEAVE ANY KIND OF FLAKY RESIDUE ON MY HAIR. AS IF THATS NOT ENOUGH, I DO HAVE A BUNCH OF GREY HAIR, AND THIS PRODUCT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF BLENDING THE HAIR TOGETHER, WHILE HIDING MOST OF THE GREY (WITH THE NAKED EYE). OVERALL, A SOLID PRODUCT OF ITS KIND, AND I NEVER SETTLE FOR ANYTHING BUT THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this large container of the styling gel my grandson has been asking for.  The pump is a very nice feature.  He loves this and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m the type of guy who has very thick, coarse dark brown hair, and it takes a LOT of hold to keep my hair styled. During a short stint of modeling (and well beyond), I needed a hair gel that would have a great hold while not looking \\&quot;flakey\\&quot; and crisp like the cheap stuff provides. Joico Ice Spiker is without a doubt one of the best types of hair gel for guys with thick hair who need serious hold, and all-day strength. I&#x27;ve been using Ice for over 10 years and I plan to continue as long as I have hair on my head! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large jar is very convienent, however the pump does occasionally clog and I have to use a paper clip to clear it out. Overall, a very small price to pay and especially for the value of the large jar!</li>
    <li> I call it my hair glue. It holds up as long as you don&#x27;t get it too wet. Your hair will stay up longer than you will under most circumstances.</li>
    <li> I use to buy the Joico Ice Spiker hair \\&quot;glue\\&quot; from most retail stores as this product works best on my hair although I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores anymore, so Amazon came to my rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great - it will hold your hair in place during a Hurricane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that it is hard to wash off of your hands after you rub it in thru your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some soap and hot water will \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the leftover \\&quot;glue\\&quot; off of your hands, but other than that, this stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 because it&#x27;s hard to wash it off of your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself, a 5/5</li>
    <li> two years and still using this daily. I hate running out and not always easy to find.</li>
    <li> This is the same product you get at a Salon for an awesome price. The product works awesome and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Loved it!! More easy to handle than other presentation!</li>
    <li> Great hold. Stays in place all day. Doesn&#x27;t flake. Pump is a great convenience for daily use.</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; service</li>
    <li> Product is good but it leaked a little during shipping. This is the second time this happened. But it&#x27;s a good product for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Ice Spiker is my must have hair styling product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found any styling product that works nearly as well as Spiker.&lt;br /&gt;The price is good,free delivery seals the deal. I am a repeat customer.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Joico</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It is super fast drying styling glue. So you have to have an idea on what you want to do with your hair before you apply it. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> A consistency of Elmer&#x27;s glue, you only need a little bit. This is what holds my straight thick short hair and allows me to spike it. It holds all day and night. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff. This 16.9 oz. tub should last you over a year. Nothing else would ever hold my hair in place, this will. Usually I can find it around locally, but it can sometimes be touch and go. Amazon is always a good place to get it when in doubt.</li>
    <li> The gel itself is good but the container it came in was broken. The pump wasn&#x27;t working so when I use the gel, I have unscrew the lid, every single time. Annoying.</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the best styling gel I&#x27;ve ever used compared to other popular products like LA Bella, AXE, or Got2B Glued. It works like a charm. It is very strong and will hold your hair in place. You don&#x27;t even have to use that much and it will hold your hair in place ALL DAY and without flakes. This gel gives you that natural subtle look instead of making your hair look all wet. It is also inexpensive, I bought a 5.1 oz for 8 bucks, it lasted me about 5 months and I use it almost everyday. I decided to get the 16.9 oz because I&#x27;ll probably be using this product for a while.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in one day. My only issue was that the bottle had hard crusted spiker all over it, either it leaked during shipping, or it was covered before it left.  Either way, I cleaned it up and it&#x27;s good to go.  Happy customer.</li>
    <li> Great price and received quickly.  Very happy and will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> I love this hair glue...can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and this gel is just what I need to keep it tucked for an entire day.</li>
    <li> I have really fine hair and it goes wherever it feels like. This is the only product that makes my hair do what I want (spike up).</li>
    <li> Cheapest deal we found anywhere and my husband loves it because it doesn&#x27;t flake nor is it difficult to wash out.</li>
    <li> The guy who cuts my hair recommended this stuff.  When I first got it I hated it, because I used a half dollar sized glob like I was used to using.  My hair set up like concrete; a true hair helmet.  It sat on the shelf for a while and I thought I&#x27;d give it another chance. This time I used about a dime sized portion and worked it in.  It doesn&#x27;t look heavy or over gelled and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s a men&#x27;s product and has a light scent like something you&#x27;d find in a barber shop. I use so little of the product, that a container this size lasts me about two years. Remember to go easy with it. This is the best gel &amp;#34;styling glue,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, purchase was exactly as described.  Very good product that holds all day, only a small amount is needed.  Matte finish when applied.</li>
    <li> A lot of Gel these days claim to have a maximum hold but really nothing compares to this (Closest is Got2B Glue). This Gel has a pleasant smell and will hold your hair through the wind/rain/etc and gives you the security of knowing your hair will stay in place.  It also comes with a great amount and this is definitely the package to buy as opposed to getting the smaller bottle.  Overall this is some of the best Gel I&#x27;ve used and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and the price was resonable with the free shipping.  If you want great hold that is water resistant this is the product for you...great molding and staying power.</li>
    <li> My favorite as a secondary hair styler. It is stiff and lasts even after swimming. Hard to remove when showering but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> Same hair gel that Jersey Shore&#x27;s Pauly D uses.  This will hold your hair in place, even in a tornado.</li>
    <li> Great product however it leaked all inside the box during shipping.</li>
    <li> I have tried countless glues, waxes, mousses, foams, etc. Nothing compares to the hold I get from Spiker!  Unlike some products, my hair doesn&#x27;t fall flat immediately after it dries. Also, I can run my hands through it and keep that tousled look that I like so much. It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky and it does not flake. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used plenty of gels throughout the years and Spiker seems to be the front runner as the best I&#x27;ve used. It seems a little expensive, but it has great quality and hold, and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot so a little goes a long way. A little Spiker with freezing spray and my hair literally doesn&#x27;t move. They have a new, satisfied, and future repeat customer.</li>
    <li> I first saw this glue at salons when the stylist put it on me. When I tried to buy it from her she demanded a hefty price and said it was exclusive to salons only. I figured I would just memorize the brand and purchase it from Amazon when I got home. This has been my 3rd tub and I hope they never stop making this stuff. Great product, holds your hair in place with the natural look and it washes out relatively easy leaving no flakes at all.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to.  It definitely is glue/paste like.  I like my hair short, but if it is too short I cannot get it to stand up and this is the ONLY stuff I have ever found that will hold it.  It also handles water very well.  You can go swimming and if you don&#x27;t towel it off very much you are still good to go.  I can even wear a motorcycle helmet for awhile and my hair still stands up when i take the helmet off!  You just may not want to go to bed with it in.  When I use it I prefer to shower and wash it out before going to bed.  Also depending on how much you use, you may want or need to shampoo twice.&lt;br /&gt;I have full bottles of other products that claimed to do what this does and did NOT. Seems expensive to me, but have not found anything else that works as well.  (except for a product NO longer available)</li>
    <li> The ONLY product that holds my son&#x27;s hair up in a faux hawk all day long! Trust me - I&#x27;ve tried them ALL! But none of them work like Spiker! It&#x27;s true to its name!</li>
    <li> This ice gel is amazing , you can do any hair style that you want you can use it with dry or wet hair , this is one of the best hair gels in the world , and this gel don&#x27;t make you lose your hair .</li>
    <li> Best Gel on the market</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t actually spike my hair, but rather gather it by &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; twisting that way and this way, and I do delcare, Joico does justice allowing me to control my hairs direction where I want it to go, not where it wants to go. Clearly, I am the boss of my heair, finally!&lt;br /&gt;JOICO ICE GEL IS NOT NASTY AND STICY, BUT A NICE CONSISTANCY, NOR GRASY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt; TRY IT!  b ET YOU , THIS BLUE HAND PUMP JAR WILL LAST YOU MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE SHORT TO MEDIUM HAIR, AND THE JAR WILL LAST ABOUT 7 MONTHS, DARN GOOD DEAL, DON&#x27;T YOU THINK?</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever. If you need a strong hair gel, this is the best one to buy. A little expensive but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and was satisfied until my last purchase. This time I left the package sealed in the wrap for a few months. After opening it and using it for a week, a clear liquid began to dispense as if it had separated from the white glue like substance. This is frustrating because the return policy is only 30 days so I&#x27;m now stuck with this.</li>
    <li> When I opened the box the gel was wrapped in a plastic, inside the plastic the container was leaking. So I had to wipe of what spilled and tighten the top. The gel in ordered is a spiker gel so hardens and is hard to get off.</li>
