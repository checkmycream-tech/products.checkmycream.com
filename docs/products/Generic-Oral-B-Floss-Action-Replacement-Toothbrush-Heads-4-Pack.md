      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the price and plan to purchase more.</li>

      <li>They worked, not the best and by far not like the originals, but can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
      <li>Good clean and did not have any problems like others but time will tell.</li>
      <li>off.&lt;br /&gt;Too good to be true, was just that.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>These work just as good as the full price ones.  </li>
      <li>I am glad with these generic brush heads which is quite good for a very good price!&lt;br /&gt;I received everything very quickly.</li>
      <li>I will say that I have had this problem once or twice but overall the brushes are great!</li>
      <li>Ok lot cheaper than manufacture</li>
      <li>I purchased the 4 pack more than a month ago.</li>
      <li>He seems pleased.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE them.  </li>
      <li>He doesn&#x27;t love with me</li>
      <li>so glad i found</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend you to get a better product and your teeth and gums will thank you.</li>
      <li>They cleaned ok, but not as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are perfect and I use them daily.  </li>
      <li>I love my Oral B Electric Toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>They seem to work okay.</li>
      <li>Okay, I think, maybe I got a defective head, there are 3 more.</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t have to feel that you are wasting more money.  </li>
      <li>but I will not be buying any more.</li>
      <li>changed my dental life for the better.</li>
      <li>By the time these wear out you just buy more and you&#x27;re still up.</li>
      <li>sure how the stiffer bristles might impact your gums over time, so I&#x27;m docking 1 star.</li>
      <li>If you are OK with a cheap product that works well - this is for you!  </li>
      <li>I recommended to my family and friends to used this products. :)</li>
      <li>I will be buying again but flossing more often.</li>
      <li>Fantastic for the price though!  </li>

      <li>Excellent brushes and fantastic low price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>They are fine, but do not seem to work any better than a lower priced head does.</li>
      <li>Fits, works fine, nothing more to add.</li>
      <li>So far I have been happy with how well these have worked.</li>
      <li>They fit on my toothbrush just fine and were very cheap compared to the name brand.  </li>
      <li>I will go back to paying $20 for a darn 3-pack and be happy they work for most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I worked for dentists for years, and a soft brush is the best way to go unless you have unusual dental problems or mouth issues.</li>
      <li>Why pay much more from Oral-B name,when the generic work great too.</li>
      <li>The Oral B dual clean compatible brush heads are much better.</li>
      <li>Overall not the best product but at the same time its a good price.</li>
      <li>So far, I liked it!</li>
      <li>The brushes work fine.  </li>

      <li>DO NOT BUY THEM, buy genuine Oral B.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Again, this is just a refill.  Love the lower price on these, not sure they are as tough or last as long as the official Oral B replacements, but the price is right for me.</li>
    <li> 3 out of 4 broke on 1 use</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitate at first, largely because of the price difference. The generic brand is really affordable. The product itself is great. It fits our electric toothbrushes perfectly. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very disappointed with this product.  I figured I&#x27;d save some money instead of buying these from CVS, but really not worth the $8.00.  The package was opened when i received it, but I really needed new heads (I wish i returned them right away), so I ignored that.  I used one for 2 days before it broke!!! Also, the head seemed hard, not soft like the oral b brand ones.</li>
    <li> Wife and I have both stabbed ourselves in the face while brushing. These heads fall off while in use causing the toothbrush &amp;#34;spinner&amp;#34; thingy to stab you in the cheek.</li>
    <li> Not the same feel as the brand name. The bristles are harder and it feels like they are wearing my gums down rather than cleaning them. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> The replacement brush heads arrived quickly and fit well, but the brush fibers were too stiff.</li>
    <li> The first brush lasted about 1 week.  Within the week one of the yellow brushes broke off and then the drive system failed (No movement in the brush). The second brush I tried lasted about 2 weeks. Within that time I lost two of the yellow brushes and then the drive system failed. I&#x27;ve used Oral-B brand for a couple of years without a single problem. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m being to ruff, since I&#x27;ve never had any problems.  My wife&#x27;s brush has lasted over a month without a single problem. They look like the original and seem to be very good quality; however, they will not work for me--2 in 3 weeks is way too expensive.  If my wife continues to have good luck with them I may continue to buy them for her.</li>
    <li> i ordered this with a lot of trepidation based on all the negative comments but after having received the item i am pleasantly surprised! the brushes appear top quality, they operate the same as original oral-b products, and several weeks into using them daily, they are holding up very well, at least as well as the originals! they must have stepped up their game since the earlier reviews. i recommend the seller of these brushes upgrade the photo they use as it makes the brushes appear dingy and cheap, definitely not reflective of their actual appearance and quality!</li>
    <li> These are junk.  The weird little plastic things between the bristles are uncomfortable, don&#x27;t really clean any better, and fall out.</li>
    <li> They are really bad knock offs. they do not spin properly and the bristles are not cut evenly and as a result it is harsh on my gum. Had to stop using it after 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> FIT doe not really match my brush, had to force it. the last one I used I had to break into pieced to take it off. !!!</li>
    <li> Received this item super fast. I&#x27;m really happy about it. Spins like e oral b, I have no issues with bristles falling off.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works perfectly with my oral b, can&#x27;t beat the price compared to the original brush heads. will buy again</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this alternative to the Oral B Floss Action. The price difference is significant but the quality is inferior. These brushes are much stiffer than the Oral B. I was reminded of a medium firm brush head. The Oral B is more like the soft brush head. The generic will clean your teeth, however your gums are going to notice the difference. I&#x27;ve given them a week thinking they might soften up, but no difference so far. At least I now know the Oral B is worth the extra money. I&#x27;ve always gotten 3 to 4 months use from each head, brushing 2 to 3 times a day for 2 to 3 minutes each time. Another product I&#x27;d like to recommend if you&#x27;d like to whiten your teeth is the Crest 3D White mouth rinse. In less than a week of daily use my teeth have never been whiter. And so much less hassle than the whitening strips.</li>
    <li> I havent had to use any of these replacements yet but they are the same as the one that came with my Oral B electric toothbrush which I love.  Im sure they are as great as the one that came on the toothbrush.  Great product. changed my dental life for the better.</li>
    <li> These work good on my oral b toothbrush.  They are a little tight, but works as good as the oral b brand.  and a lot less money.</li>
    <li> These are not even close to real Oral-B toothbrush heads, they pinch lips, and bite the inside of my mouth.</li>
    <li> not perfect like the originals. one messed up quickly and stopped spinning. Others worked for a a while.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the generic toothbrush heads were going to be a waste of money or not, but for the low price, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I LOVE them.  I think they work just as good as the name brand brush heads and they were a fraction of the price!  I will definitely order these for now on.</li>
    <li> Why pay $22 per head?</li>
    <li> These brushes are defective and the flossing pieces come off in your mouth about 2 weeks after you start using them.  Not at all worth the money.</li>
    <li> I knew I was taking a risk buying the off-brand toothbrush heads for my oral B electric toothbrush. These did not withstand the test. I like the \\&quot;floss action heads,\\&quot; but the yellow plastic strips with blue bands on them started coming off right away. First it was the bands, then the yellow plastic parts all came off. I am back on my search to find lower priced toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> The S&amp;H was 1 1/2 times the cost of the product. I was not aware of it at the time of purchase.  When I bought this item, and the electric tooth brush, it was offered FREE S&amp;H, it was NOT clear that it was only for the toothbrush.  Needles to say I was very unhappy to see the cost. To me it was an example in manipulation in advertising. \\&quot;WARNING, WARNING\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Just like the real thing. Bought them a few times now. Great product and Shipping.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit.  I use one hand to hold the electric toothbrush and the other to hold these on.  They just don&#x27;t fit.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> Definitely not as good as Oral B. Bought two packs in Nov. 1st brush lasted for almost a month, 2nd about week, 3rd about 3 days. I will be replacing both packs before you know it. Stick to the original.</li>
    <li> I did not have high expectations for this one, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try, as it&#x27;s a quarter the price of the brand-name ones.  I can barely tell the difference.  Something feels a bit different...maybe it&#x27;s a bit stiffer or something, but maybe it&#x27;s just knowing that it&#x27;s different.  But it&#x27;s definitely not bad.  The packaging was coming apart, and the wording on the box is all German....so I was really skeptical going in, but the Germans came through in the end.</li>
    <li> They catch your mouth and pinch... They do not clean as well.. Overall, I&#x27;m disappointed in the quality and lack or rotation.</li>
    <li> We have three toothbrushes and this is a much cheaper way to go.  Have not used for three months yet so I don&#x27;t know how they match up or how long they will last before the bristles turn white.</li>
    <li> I only used them a few times, but they are low cost alternative compatible with the  Oral B brush, I would purchase again,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of these generic brush heads, and these are the worst, way too soft and the floss action is a joke.</li>
    <li> These look very similar to the original Oral B Floss Action brush heads but are not the same at all.  If I can return these I will but not sure it is even worth the time.  They are very firm &amp; stiff &amp; the yellow floss part of the head sticks out when the head rotates and gets bent then cuts into your gums. After using one just three days, I replaced it with an original Oral B head because it created sores in my gums.</li>
    <li> We purchased these Generic Oral-B Floss Action Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 Pk) and found out they are terrible. We do not recommend them. They are no where near compatible, they feel terrible and they do not clean. DO NOT BUY THEM, buy genuine Oral B. Unfortunately we did not use them within the return window but that is only a minor inconvenience.</li>
    <li> I got this item quickly. The price I think was very good and it just as the original.  After these are used up I will purchase this item again</li>
    <li> I can barely tell the difference but these work and they do the job. They dont leave me feeling as clean as the name brand without haveing to floss after. I will be buying again but flossing more often.</li>
    <li> Not worth the savings for generic, the yellow flosser pieces came off after just a few flossings.  Not a comparable product to the brand name.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking &amp;#34;How bad could they be?&amp;#34; Well, this has to be my worst Amazon purchase yet. Within a few days of using the first brush head, bristles were falling out and two of the flossing Micropulse bristles had broken off. I may be a bit of an aggressive brusher, but for at least 6 months previous to this I used several OralB brand heads and this NEVER happened. Okay, I think, maybe I got a defective head, there are 3 more. So I try the next one. Within a week, the same thing. Now I&#x27;m ticked. I will never order from Pearl Enterprises again and I am looking into asking Amazon for my money back. Steer clear, it&#x27;s no bargain!</li>
    <li> Horrible. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> First, the bristles are supposed to be soft.  They&#x27;re not; they&#x27;re hard.&lt;br /&gt;Second, after just a few weeks, 2 of the rubber tips have broken off.&lt;br /&gt;Too good to be true, was just that.&lt;br /&gt;Now the whole brush head has come apart in my mouth.  This product is a choke hazard.</li>
    <li> These are a cheaply made version of the originals. the  motor goes out in them at about a  month and the bristles are weak. spend the extra money and get the original brands</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This 4-pack, running at half the price of the brand name version, is definitely a bargain. It&#x27;s just not a good one. I&#x27;m not the type who spends money on brand names if I don&#x27;t have to, but in this case I think I&#x27;ll be making an exception. Of the 4 brush heads that come in the pack, only 2 actually worked. One of the brush heads started loosing the floss bristles after 1 week, while on another the spring that is responsible for pulsing the brush broke after 2 weeks. A minor inconvenience is the fact that the blue bristles on this generic brand don&#x27;t change color over time to let you know when it&#x27;s time to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, assuming the brand name brush heads actually last a minimum of 3 months like they&#x27;re supposed to, it turns out to be the same cost for the brand name brush heads (seeing as how I threw out half of this pack). Of course, I still don&#x27;t like the idea of spending $21 for 3 brush heads. In fact, since I inherited the Oral-B electric toothbrush from my dentist as a complementary gift, I&#x27;m considering just going back to the good old days of brushing my teeth with a normal toothbrush. They&#x27;re affordable, reliable, and don&#x27;t make your nose itch.</li>
    <li> The bristles are really tough and hurt my gums! Don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on the generic brand. Just buy the real Oral B brand replacement heads.</li>
    <li> These are extraordinarily less expensive than the official oral B brush heads, but when you get them, you&#x27;ll know why. The plastic floss &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are very flimsy, and I find that it regularly pinches the inside of my cheeks while I&#x27;m brushing if I&#x27;m not careful. It&#x27;s not a terribly painful pinch, but not really something I enjoy while trying to brush my teeth. Some reviews complain of the brush shedding bristles - I haven&#x27;t experienced that, aside from one of the blue bands around the floss &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; to break off while I was brushing in my mouth. Not the whole thing, just the tiny blue band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But once again, they&#x27;re inexpensive. Are they as good as Oral B? Not by a long shot. But it&#x27;s a suitable toothbrush, and I don&#x27;t regret my purchase for the price. Just don&#x27;t go in thinking you&#x27;re going to be comparing apples to apples, it&#x27;s a similar product, but it&#x27;s not really the same at all.</li>
    <li> We have used 3 of the 4 that came in the package, and within a week of starting to use them, the yellow flosh action pieces broke off.  The bristles are very hard and stiff.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great seller!</li>
    <li> Two out of the four did not work. So for five bucks still not a bad deal. Would probably purchase again</li>
    <li> These compatible replacement heads are just bad! They fail after a few unacceptable uses.</li>
    <li> Much more cost effective than local stores.</li>
    <li> Ive compared these generic heads side by side with Oral B Floss Action heads.  The generic heads are definitely more stiffer.  If the floss action stiffness was a 6 out of 10 then the generics are a 8 out of 10.  I was able to manage but it may be too much for people with sensitive gums.  Also they do soften over time(~2 weeks) and then feel just as soft as Oral B.  But my biggest complaint is the movement of these generic heads.  The generics head spin is not as effective as the Oral B ones.  Its almost like very small oscillation movements while the Oral B brushes rotate back and forth about a quarter of a circle.  I wouldnt say these are worthless but I think I&#x27;ll just stock up when Oral B has a sell than get these again.  UPDATE:  I feel my 3 star rating was a little too generous especially after getting a deal on a 3 pack of the Oral B heads for just under $13.  The motion of these generic heads simply do not compare to the real deal.  Its basically a vibrating toothbrush.</li>
    <li> The heads loose their floss bristles after a couple uses. I will never buy these again. I guess it pays to buy the real deal when it comes to brush heads.</li>
    <li> These work just like buying them from a store.  The best thing was they came in a value pack so I spent a lot less than if I tould have bought them in a store.</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of generic Oral-B tooth brushes.  I chose the Floss Action because they have seemed to be more durable than the standard brush head, from my previous experience. Again, this has turned out to be accurate.  The brush head of the Generics last as long as the Brand Name Oral-Bs, but the internal mechanism controlling brush head rotation is not as durable.  An overall brush expectancy of 4-6 wks is easily achieved. One should change the brush this frequently,  anyway. The generics are a great bargain for the price, which is only a fraction of the much, much more expensive counterpart. They come from China, as do the original Branded ones, so expect longer delivery times. However, Amazon has never failed me with a missed delivery.</li>
    <li> this item shipped on the day that was displayed on the order which was 3 weeks after the order was placed.</li>
    <li> They fit and they work, so that deserves a few stars.  The plastic floss sticks broke off within the first few days.  That&#x27;s annoying because they break off in your mouth and you have to fish little pieces of plastic out.  I won&#x27;t buy again, but if you only care about price, go for it.  I also had to give the postoffice $0.65 because it was short postage since it was a rigid envelope.</li>
    <li> This is a cheap replacement for Oral-B brush. The bristles are very hard and scrape the gum. After one week of using, some bristles started to fell off. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These brushes would be very good for paint removal. They sure a worthless for brushing teeth. Just proves you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.  Lasts about a week, then the yellow rubber things start to snap off during use.  Would never buy these generics again, the brand name ones are far better and worth the price</li>
    <li> In the product description it was advertised as soft bristles, but they are quite hard in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made them actually soft.</li>
    <li> Never buy this item !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money. Product doesn&#x27;t work , stopped working within 2 days. Not even worth the money they are asking. Save some $$$$.</li>
    <li> Great for now. Had zero problems thus far. Hard bristles so if your teeth are sensitive would not recommend.  Good clean and did not have any problems like others but time will tell. Got mine for four and change, if they even one lasts a month at that price worth it. Be back later. One month later zero problems the bristles show no signs of wear. Not one problem other reviews state.</li>
    <li> This is a very poor make... and it so bad that I can&#x27;t even use. I have to through always all of than because it hurt while I bush ...</li>
    <li> These do not last as long as OEM replacment heads,  but they are better than I expected for the price.</li>
    <li> These are so much cheaper than the official replacement heads it&#x27;s almost ridiculous.  I have bought over a dozen packages of these heads and only found one that just refused to work.  Even if that rate of failure gets worse these are still a good deal.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother!  They all broke within a week.</li>
    <li> Good price on these, but some of them stopped working after a few brushes.</li>
    <li> My whole family is using this, so it is not as original but you change it more frequently and it is OK:)</li>
    <li> Cheaply made, won&#x27;t order again, not worth it!</li>
    <li> The yellow pieces fell off pretty quickly from the head.  I know they say generic but I would just spring for the real deal.  Not worth the savings.</li>
    <li> awesome price and its just the the brand name except no rip off prices i will buy again as soon as i need</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re quite as good as the original replacement but I don&#x27;t care. By the time these wear out you just buy more and you&#x27;re still up.</li>
    <li> For the price, $5.84, it&#x27;s not bad.  The brush head pretty much fell apart after 3 weeks.  Being that each brush head cost $1.46, that may not be a deal breaker for some.  The yellow floss things broke off within a week but the blue bristles stayed attached the entire time.  The actual oscillating had is what stopped working, the mechanism broke from the inside.</li>
    <li> These brushes may look like the Oral B brand but they don&#x27;t rotate as well and the bristles are harder. This makes for an uncomfortable experience. the money saved by purchasing these is not worth it. This is one of those instances where buying the brand name pays off.</li>
    <li> I bought these because they were inexpensive. They go on the toothbrush and they clean my teeth reasonably well, but the fit is somewhat lose, and sometimes they come off again while I am brushing. This is highly disconcerting, to say the least. Henceforth I will pay the price for Oral-B brush heads.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY!!!!  The yellow tabs break off after 2-3 uses, bristles are extra stiff, and the rotation breaks!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.  Out of the pack of 4, one did not work at all, one broke the first time I used it, one won&#x27;t stay on the toothbrush, and the one I tried using is so stiff it felt like razor blades on my gums.  Go ahead and by the brand name brush heads, these are useless.</li>
    <li> These brush heads were a little hard but now they are perfect.</li>
    <li> I do not recommend these - I think they may have been factory rejects - the yellow bristles all fell out while in use.  Do not let your kids use these.</li>
    <li> Work great! I have purchased these brushes several times and haven&#x27;t been disappointed yet. I have read other reviews that complain about the brushes not holding together very well. I will say that I have had this problem once or twice but overall the brushes are great! For the difference in price even if  two in a pack fell apart (never happened to me) these would still be a fantastic deal.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend - they fell apart after only a few brushings - stopped moving and floss action pieces fell out.</li>
    <li> They all break shortly after I started to use it. All 2 packs were the same! Total waste of money.I had to rate it with one star because otherwise I couldn&#x27;t rate it.</li>
    <li> I like these toothbrush heads. They actually work almost as well as the original floss action toothbrush heads. Decent product!!</li>
    <li> They break down after first use. Please avoid</li>
    <li> Product was delivered in a timely manner and was as described!</li>
    <li> Product information is accurate. It works just like the real McCoy. Will buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> So far, 3 of the 4 replacement heads have broken and stopped spinning within a week of changing them.  I had purchased a different set of generic replacement heads before that lasted for months and never stopped working before the bristles needed replacing.</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected, and look just like the original Oral B brush heads.  So far they seem to work the same.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the price and plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> They just don&#x27;t work.  They don&#x27;t make connection to the metal shaft on the toothbrush handle.  So what you get is a little bit of vibration feeling in the toothbrush head, but no twisting action.  It wasn&#x27;t that one of the brush heads was bad, all of them are. Totally ineffective and probably the worst product I&#x27;ve ever gotten thru Amazon.</li>
    <li> They fall apart in your mouth when you brush your teeth....I am on number 4 and it happens within days and weeks of using them.</li>
    <li> The head is not loose enough to rotate freely like the oral b ones are. They don&#x27;t click into place either. I only used it for a few seconds before I realized it wasn&#x27;t going to do the job. I hate when name brands are so expensive, but I am too afraid of breaking my base with these stiff heads.</li>
    <li> good quality for a great price ;-)</li>
    <li> I now have used the brush over a week and all floss brushes have fallen out. The unfortunate part is, when they fall out you have them float in your mouth. Juck! I cannot recommend these at all! These don&#x27;t even come close to the originals. Very hard brushes as other reviewers have already mentioned. Even though they are low cost but since I could only use it 6 times and it was broken, it is a complete waist of money.</li>
    <li> Great price, but not worth the risk of swallowing the pieces when this cheaply made product comes apart while brushing your teeth!  SCARY!  Pay the extra $ for the real thing in this case!  Each of the 4 I bought dismantled and luckily I didn&#x27;t swallow the metal springs/pieces/parts!!!</li>
    <li> When I ordered these I was just hoping for a less expensive option for the brush heads while expecting a lower quality. These really surprised me. They feel just like the more expensive Oral B (4-pack $24.99 these $7.99). By the way, this toothbrush and brush head combination have shortened my professional cleaning time substantially and made it much less painful. I don&#x27;t floss (I think you have to be an oral hygienist to floss), but my hygienist thought that I was.</li>
    <li> When I found this listed for so much less than OEM I was concerned they would not be as good. So when I purchased them I also purchased an OEM so I could compare. When both arrived I pulled one of each and in every way, minus the logo, they looked the same. Next I starteded to use them alternating between them each day. Its been about a month and I can still tell no difference. These work as well as OEM. I will be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> If you just want to get stuff off your teeth, these generic heads are probably okay, but I threw mine in the trash because they completely lack the gum-massaging property that makes this toothbrush enjoyable to use.  I can&#x27;t quite tell by visual inspection what makes them different, but to my gums it&#x27;s night and day.  Also, the packaging (cardboard, weak adhesive) didn&#x27;t strike me as particularly sanitary.</li>
    <li> the yellow &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; bristles were so hard they cut my gums,  Thankfully they soon broke off.  The brush by itself isn&#x27;t too bad, but I wanted the flossing action.</li>
    <li> These seemed really good at first but the yellow bristles fall out after only about a week. I thought it was just a bad brush head but it&#x27;s happened with the second brush head as well.</li>
    <li> the very first time I used them they didn&#x27;t spin, what a disappointment, threw them away . Stick with the oral b replacements, get what you want,something that at least works and last, not these</li>
    <li> Terrible these fall apart and are dangerous</li>
    <li> They dont stay attached to my toothbrush, like they should. I guess I got what I paid for considering they were $30 cheaper than the real thing</li>
    <li> The answer is, brushing your teeth with something that does not clean, and is clearly not any good. I actually realized that for the first time in my cavity-free life that I wasn&#x27;t brushing regularly. And its because these little terrible awful &#x27;generic&#x27; heads don&#x27;t clean! Literally, you brush and there is still plaque. I took the same logic tact you are probably taking right now: \\&quot;it&#x27;s like 2 oz of plastic, how can it be $6-8 each OEM?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t care, I have been using a manual brush and liberal placker use to make up for these. They are cheap. You get exactly what you pay for in this case, and since regular brushing with a fancy electric toothbrush is an insurance policy against more expensive, painful procedures, this is a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I went through all 4 of these brush heads very quickly, as the brushhead itself would break, separating from the body and rendering itself useless.  Each brush lasted about 3-4 weeks.  YMMV, but buyer beware.</li>
    <li> work just like the originals</li>
    <li> So I bought this item and only 3 heads arrived out of four! Most importantly, TWO of them are broken! What else can I say? Also, these heads were not pack in a little box like the image describes, but came individually! I feel so angry and this is an AWFUL shopping experience! I will never buy this product again!</li>
    <li> i will never buy this again because none of the heads fits. Yeh, you get what you pay for! don&#x27;t get a generic one.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A VERY VERY LOW QUALITY PRODUCT MOST DANGEROUS FOR USE. THIS NOT ONLY WILL DESTROY THE COSTLY BRUSH BUT FORCE THE USER TO BLEED. GUMS WILL BE SCRATCHED AND DESTROYED. ONE SHOULD BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT. ORIGINAL UNIT IS ARROUND 15 DOLLARS ON SALE NOW. LOW COST OF THIS ITEM IS HARMFUL FOR DENTAL HEALTH.THESE PRODUCTS SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DR. DASH</li>
    <li> RECEIVED THESE NEW BRUSH HEADS -- USED TWICE AND THE HEAD BROKE IN 2 PLACES - TOTALLY UNUSABLE. SO FAR SECOND HEAD STILL INTACT BUT ONLY HAVE BEEN USING FOR 2 WEEKS. BRISTLES ARE FIRMER THAN \\&quot;ORAL B\\&quot;</li>
    <li> seriously im so glad i found u  at the stores these refills ridiculous  priced  and they only come in odd pkg if 3????  yours is even number of 4 and  me and my husband share the set over time  it is great!  only negative is shipping  wish it was a flat rate  oh well still a deal!!!</li>
    <li> These work great with my Oral B electric toothbrush. One of them was a little difficult to get off and on, but not enough to make a huge difference, I just chose not to use it right away. The bristles were pretty tough at first (ouch, my gums!) but softened up after a couple brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fantastic savings, and hardly a difference from brand-name. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> The floss part came off but they work as a regular toothbrush attachment.  Fantastic for the price though!  I will order them again.</li>
    <li> For the price of these brush heads you can&#x27;t beat it. They do not last as long as the OEM ones but they are def worth it.</li>
    <li> First off, I hate spending $20 on replacement heads for my Oral-B toothbrush so these are not such a bad alternative. When you start using them, the yellow floss sticks on the brush make it a much more aggressive brushing so if you need a soft brush you may not like that. BUT the yellow things FALL OFF while you are brushing so eventually you have a soft brush anyway! The blue part of the bristles doesn&#x27;t seem to fade as well as the Oral-B brand so you may need to pay attention to when you started using it if you are adament about changing your brush regularly on schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are not the greatest quality since they literally fall apart but they still do the job and I am continuing to use them til my package is empty.</li>
    <li> They came pretty quick but the package wasn&#x27;t closed so i had to steam them before i used them. Worth the price though</li>
    <li> This was the first time using a generic but I see them just a good as originals.&lt;br /&gt;The floss bristles really do work just let the bristles do the work don&#x27;t press down&lt;br /&gt;other wise these may be to rough for your gums.</li>
    <li> Fits, works fine, nothing more to add.</li>
    <li> ehh....It feels and looks harsh...I am scared it will ruin my gums somehow...I would recommend to just get the Oral B brand as it might not be worth sacrificing your gums</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try to buy it. For the fraction of the cost from the original brand this is a keeper.</li>
    <li> Buy it excellent product. I am using it very pleased with this purchase. I recommends to buy it, you will be happy.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for.  These brush heads last 1 month if your lucky.  Would buy else where next time.</li>
    <li> The brushes work fine.  Some of the little blue tags on the yellow blades fall off, but I don&#x27;t think that matters much.  The brushes should be replaced every 2 -3 months (same, really, for the brand name brushes), but at this price it is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any issues what-so-ever with these. The flossing bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out like other reviewers claim, and over all the build quality is spot on to the more expensive Oral-B branded heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints here.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the OEM  brush heads and 1/4 the cost. xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx  xxx xxx  xx?</li>
    <li> Thanks so much, I will sure order this way again, its the only way to shop, purrrrfecto purrfrecto, why all the words</li>
    <li> We got these for our vitality oral-b electric toothbrushes.  They do not seem like quite as good of quality as the name brand but they are much much less expensive. We would buy these again, the floss heads work well and give your teeth a better cleaning than the regular brush heads</li>
    <li> They worked, not the best and by far not like the originals, but can&#x27;t beat the price. Sometimes the whole thing will come off of the power unit while your using it, not a big deal you just pop it back on. The sweeper heads break off within 4-5 uses, but you get what you pay for. You still have a tooth brush just not the sweeper part.</li>
    <li> They are not a bargin.  They don&amp;#34;t last. Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my son.  He seems pleased.  He doesn&#x27;t love with me so I don&#x27;t know how they are doing daily.&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
    <li> Please stay away from this very poorly made product. It is not safe. It cut the mouth of my wife and daughter. Amazon should not allow these cheap knock-offs. When is someone going to take Amazon to court and make them responsible for selling products that hurt people?</li>
    <li> I took a chance at these, thinking hmmm, how hard is it to make a knock-off brush head!? Well, I got burned and will never buy them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, they came in a package that just fell apart as soon as I picked it up, so all 4 heads just fell out on the floor, like they were repackaged or something shoddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, 3 of the 4 heads do not spin at all. They just barely vibrate as it is clear they aren&#x27;t syncing up with the main toothbrush at all. I&#x27;m on my 4th head and it is currently working ok, but the other 3 never actually spin and certainly do not accomplish what this toothbrush should be doing while using it. My fancy toothbrush is basically rendered a useless vibrating manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be some kind of plastic tube in the head that the metal stem on the main body should slip into thus creating the spinning/vibrating function. This plastic tube in the 3 heads that don&#x27;t work is off-center and unable to be recentered, causing the metal stem to not sync properly with it. So, 3 heads are wasted. Not a good deal ultimately when you think about it. I will go back to paying $20 for a darn 3-pack and be happy they work for most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really like how they felt either. They are definitely made of cheaper material and the brush head itself feels coarser and overall just vibrates pretty awkwardly, creating a feeling of plastic on teeth a lot more than I would like to feel. Definitely not a fan. WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> The generic Oral-B Floss Action Compatible Replacement Brush Heads work just as well as the name brand.Why pay much more from Oral-B name,when the generic work great too.</li>
    <li> Worth the money&lt;br /&gt;Superior teeth cleaning.Just a shame to waste money on the original&lt;br /&gt;It is my duty to note that one of them broke me very quickly</li>
    <li> I bought 2 packs of these brushes (8 heads total) and so far about half of them have broken before they were due to be changed. The heads stop spinning which makes them useless.  The flossing action parts are also way to hard, especially when compared to the oral b flossing heads. I&#x27;ve used other generic flossing action heads and they all worked fine, but these ones are not good. I actually resorted to breaking the flossing plastic parts off of the heads as it was like brushing with a plastic fork. The only saving grace of these was that they were cheap. They work for a little while but I will not be buying any more.</li>
    <li> They fit &amp; work for my toothbrush, just as I hoped &amp; expected. Good deal, good price, great value. Thanks.</li>
    <li> These are not a good replacement head.  Yes, they fit my brush, but after about a weeks use the rubbery &#x27;flosser&#x27; pieces just come out while brushing.  This is unfortunately a case of you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I use these brush heads for my Oral B Triumph tooth brush. I like these because they are severely less expensive than the Oral B brand and they work just as good.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first, but they proved to be great.  I just replace my old head, with this one.  It snaps on just like the real oral-B brand head.  I think it is just a little harder than the oral-B brand head, but overall, great product for the price.</li>
    <li> these came loose and not packaged properly. The brushes are not the same quality as ones you would buy at the store. I won&#x27;t buy these again from this company.</li>
    <li> The brush heads on this item fall off consistently. It is a very poor design. The Oral B dual clean compatible brush heads are much better.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t even compare to the mfgr made replacement heads</li>
    <li> Works great and as described. Orders the 4 pack and have used one of the heads everyday twice a day for the last week. Works great. Haven&#x27;t noticed any bristles separating or coming out as indicated by other reviews. Mine work great! Cant beat the price.</li>
    <li> The yellow  plastic things hurt my gums and mouth.  Foreign manufacturer.  Not what I expected.  They do fit the Oral B electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Awful ... the pieces come off in your mouth the first time you use them. They&#x27;re useless!</li>
    <li> These work just as good as the full price ones.  They are perfect and I use them daily.  I just can&#x27;t understand paying full price for these.  Even if one turns out bad and falls apart, you are still saving so much money.  Highly suggest these to anyone thinking about wasting money on the name brand toothbrush heads.</li>
    <li> It may not be the brand name version but these things work great and they last a long time.  I will definitely buy more of these instead of the Oral B brush heads flossing action.</li>
    <li> I got the wrong staff, but I did not send them back because I thought it will cost more that what I pay for them so I just kept them, have no idea for what</li>
    <li> I am glad with these generic brush heads which is quite good for a very good price!&lt;br /&gt;I received everything very quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago.  It&#x27;s a generic brand but it works just as good as the oral b products and it&#x27;s a lot cheeper.</li>
    <li> I was looking for affordable replacement heads and these work great.  They don&#x27;t fit as tight as the original heads but do fine.&lt;br /&gt;I like that they have large heads to cover the teeth.  I will definately order these again.</li>
    <li> The first brush I used had fallen apart within 3 week. I wouldn&#x27;t buy. Spend the extra on the name brand.</li>
    <li> Two of the flossing components came off in my mouth while I was brushing.  The others were loose and I removed them, leaving only the regular bristle pieces.</li>
    <li> great deal for the money</li>
    <li> I purchased the 4 pack more than a month ago. The first head i used lasted very long. The only reason i stopped using it was because the bristles on the brushes started the bend easily. The second head I used only lasted a few uses. The brush part that spins became very loose and separated, causing it to pinch and cut your mouth. I&#x27;m on my third head now and have noticed it seems a bit loose but still usable. Overall not the best product but at the same time its a good price. I figure if at least 1 or two of the head last a while its better than pay 4 times the price for the name brands. I would only recommend this if you&#x27;re willing to take a chance that you might get a faulty product.</li>
    <li> Did not like made in China. They did fit my brush perfectly. They performed as well as expected. The cost was comparable to USA stores. Sam&#x27;s Club was very close in price. The shipping was added to each set which was slightly deceptive.</li>
    <li> if you like to bleed these are the brushes for you.  the bristles tend to come out and the yellow things are super hard.</li>
    <li> They do clean as well as Oral B when working, but some don&#x27;t work out of the pack, and of those that do, bristles break off.</li>
    <li> Go for the brand name. These fall apart easily, so you really don&#x27;t save money.</li>
    <li> I thought i was getting a great deal with these generic toothbrush heads but they were way to hard and I couldn&#x27;t even use them without experiencing pain. Don&#x27;t let the price fool you into buying them... just get the real thing!</li>
    <li> Generic Oral-B floss action works good as original Oral-B floss action. So far, I liked it! I recommended to my family and friends to used this products. :)</li>
    <li> They fit on my toothbrush just fine and were very cheap compared to the name brand.  I have no problems with the bristle stiffness, though I can&#x27;t directly compare this to the name brand because I haven&#x27;t used that style of the namebrand head in a kind of long time (too pricey! My most recent purchase was the drug store brand of the plainest head, and that didn&#x27;t fit well on the toothbrush and didn&#x27;t do as good of a job on the plaque removal.)</li>
    <li> Fell apart after a week.</li>
    <li> The heads stop working well after about a weeks worth of brushing.  I have purchased off brands at brick and morter stores without this issue. These are just worthless.</li>
    <li> The bristles are stiffer than the brand name bristles, they seem to soften after a week, but still not as good as the brand name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure how the stiffer bristles might impact your gums over time, so I&#x27;m docking 1 star. For the price they&#x27;re hard to beat, but I&#x27;m not certain the savings are worth it yet. Asking your dentist about the stiffer bristles might be wise if you plan to use these all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also rattle after a short while, louder than the brand name heads.</li>
    <li> Work but the joint losses up quickly so that you loose the scrubbing action. Less then half the life of the OEM.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work at all on oral-b</li>
    <li> very quickly, bristles started falling out, and the plastic yellow flossy things break off quickly.  I&#x27;m using mine to scrub grout, ugh.&lt;br /&gt;i think my next toothbrush is just going to be a sonicare, kinda over the larger toothbrush as a whole</li>
    <li> Purchased these after reading reviews and wished I would have paid closer attention to the complaints!  After just several uses, the floss part of the head started coming off.  Thought it was a fluke so tried another head and the same thing happened.  NOT worth the money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never do reviews but don&#x27;t want anyone else to waste their money like I did.</li>
    <li> I guess it depends on the type of generic brush head you get, but the ones I got are useless. As soon as you put any pressure on it, like when you brush your teeth, the brush head stops turning and just sits on your tooth motionless. I guess if you get one that works it is worth the money, but it is a gamble.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this generic brand of the Oral-B brush head, but was very pleasantly surprised at the quality, ease of fit and performance.  The price was a huge factor in my purchase.</li>
    <li> I love my Oral B Electric Toothbrush.  I bought one for my grandson and saw the &#x27;generic&#x27; brushes so I ordered some for myself.  They are very inferior.  The base that attaches to the oral B toothbrush cracked after just a few uses.  We threw those out and put on new ones and the same thing happened!  Not worth the money for these.  Stick with the real thing.</li>
    <li> These funny-looking heads take a little getting used to.  They are slightly oval; the yellow bristles are sort of plastic and a little firmer than the white/aqua ones.  Bottom line: my mouth feels like these give a somewhat cleaner/more thorough brushing/cleaning than the ordinary replacement brushes.</li>
    <li> I cant believe people are bad mouthing these brushes. I think they last longer and are just as good a quality as the $24.99 brushes.</li>
    <li> The brush only worked for about two weeks. The bristles are really flimsy. The yellow floss scrubs on the bristle falls off after a week of use. There is a small metal pin that falls out of the brush, while using the brush, and the brush head stops moving (really dangerous with kids using it). All you get is a vibrator in your mouth. I thought I would save some money and try it out. I would never buy this product again. I went back to the original manufacturer product and will gladly spend the extra money to get a 100% better product that will actually work.</li>
    <li> yes its cheap but you&#x27;ll regret it. I&#x27;d recommend you to get a better product and your teeth and gums will thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent brushes and fantastic low price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend them as a great product.and value for your Oral B.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Ok lot cheaper than manufacture</li>
    <li> Terrible set of four and three have stopped turning..</li>
    <li> Lasts less than a week before the paddles are all gone - they start breaking up/off even earlier - and the bristles soften that quickly.</li>
    <li> not good compared to real oral b brand heads.The brand name spin at least twice as fast and are much better. also these brake  after a few days use anyway.</li>
    <li> Too cheap very disapointed in this item I thought it would be better than this it even came in opened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product because every since I received the item I had to use 2 replacement brushes because after a few usage the bristles have broken off...I guess that&#x27;s what I get for buying the generic..:(</li>
    <li> I purchased the Generic Oral-B Floss Action Compatible Replacement Brush Heads (4 Pk), after buying a power toothbrush by Oral B.  Like the toothbrush, but the reason for two stars for the Generic Replacement Brush heads, is due to them not holding up like the regular Oral B brushes that come with the tooth brush when new.  The brush components that are shaped like flat surface spatulas break off after several uses and over time all four will break off.  The brush itself will remain useable after this happens, but these spatulas should not break off.</li>
    <li> Not truly a replacement, replacement to me means that it works the same as the original.  Not even close.  Much softer, poor durability, poor quality, not a good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So these are cheap, both in price and quality.  We have the head of one fall off after 2 weeks, another become very wobbly.  They cleaned ok, but not as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> If you can get them to work for more than 4 times, the bristles are way too hard compared to the original brand. These things hurt after using them for a few days.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re getting what you pay for. The bristles and plastic &amp;#34;things&amp;#34; will fall out after little use.</li>
    <li> Within 20 days of receiving these, two are no longer working. They vibrate, but no longer move as they should. I should have spent the money to get the offical Oral B ones. Waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 1 day later and the third one broke. I am not even going to bother trying the fourth one.</li>
    <li> Finally replaced my brush head yesterday and these are nothing like the name brand heads, they don&#x27;t spin or clean your teeth, they just vibrate, don&#x27;t waste your money on them!!!</li>
    <li> I was impressed at first, but by week 2 realized there were marked differences, and next time I won&#x27;t think about saving the change, but my comfort while brushing my teeth. They don&#x27;t fit the handle as well as the Oral B replacements, and they are much harder! I worked for dentists for years, and a soft brush is the best way to go unless you have unusual dental problems or mouth issues. These replacements are very uncomfortable to use, and I ended up throwing the last 2 out in the trash. Not worth the discomfort! Would not recommend this product unless you are cleaning the bathroom corners and need a stiff brush.</li>
    <li> The brush heads Were so stiff they made my gums hurt.  The floss action prongs fell off one by one within 3 weeks of use.  I won&#x27;t buy these again... I probably won&#x27;t even use them for my teeth... Maybe I can use them to clean my motorcycle</li>
    <li> I thought by the original pictures, they were the same type as I purchased in the past, but were not quite the same.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was great, and I haven&#x27;t used any as to how well they perform, so I can&#x27;t say how they will do.</li>
    <li> If you are OK with a cheap product that works well - this is for you!  Oral-B replacement heads can be VERY expensive, and I find that these work just as well for much less cost.  Plus if you want to change out your toothbrush head more frequently (which you should do anyways) you don&#x27;t have to feel that you are wasting more money.  The only drawback to these were the packaging - it fell apart and now I have to store them in a ziplock bag.</li>
    <li> Great value! perfect!</li>
    <li> They are fine, but do not seem to work any better than a lower priced head does.</li>
    <li> Good Quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried a generic toothbrush head.  I think it was the cost that made me try them.  They work very well.  The brush is not as soft as the orginal but it is not so hard that it hurts to use it.  I am very happy with them.</li>
    <li> These toothbrush heads fit my Oral B toothbrush perfectly.  However, there&#x27;s something about the way the bristles are shaped that is rougher on my teeth and gums.  It also vibrates and spins more violently than the original toothbrush heads.  I&#x27;ll deal with it b/c they are so much cheaper but they are definitely a downgrade in comfort of the tooth brushing experience.</li>
    <li> Two of the four broke within just a few weeks of use - with one, some bristles fell of first, and then the brush fell off the rest of the head. With another, part of the connection with the head broke, so it doesn&#x27;t rotate correctly anymore. It&#x27;s hard to beat the price for these, but I&#x27;d rather get something that&#x27;s better quality.</li>
    <li> The floss bristles on my brush came off as if they had been glued on shortly after i started using it. eventually all of them came off and what was left of the brush didn&#x27;t clean my teeth properly.</li>
    <li> One of the packages arrived opened already and the brush heads fit snugger and sound a bit different that the more expensive ones when being used.  They seem to work okay.</li>
    <li> The brush broke off a few days after I put it on. I went through a 4 pack within 2 months. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper than the in store brands and gets the job done. Zero issues and is compatable with my Oral B brush.</li>
    <li> the plastics on the brush head started to fall apart within a week of use. And i am a light user, using the brush only once a day. After 2 weeks of use, all I had left on the brush head was the soft bristle portion. Would not recommend buying the product, complete rip-off.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a generic brand so expect not a 100% compatible. It just vibrate, it does not really move. That&#x27;s why the price is cheap.</li>
    <li> So far I have been happy with how well these have worked. We have not always been as lucky with the generic replacement brushes, so I am happy that this set is working like they should.</li>
