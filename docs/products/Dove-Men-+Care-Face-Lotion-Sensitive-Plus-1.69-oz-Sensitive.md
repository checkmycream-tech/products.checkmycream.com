      <li>It&#x27;s soothing and I always feel like my face is a bit more relaxed after I use it.</li>
      <li>I literally cannot emphasize how much I love this face lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the quality of the men&#x27;s care items from Dove and this lotion is no exception.</li>

      <li>Wish I had more of it.</li>

      <li>you are going to give it a try I highly recommend dove mens+care face wash 2 great products that any guy should be with out.</li>
      <li>product is pretty good.</li>
      <li>ive used this for a couple of years and loved it, however the new stuff has SPF and a very strong fragrance..</li>
      <li>Other lotions don&#x27;t feel as good on my face as they do on my hands, but this lotion feels great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great way to keep your face feeling smooth and looking healthy if you have sensitive skin, which a lot of us do.</li>
      <li>It is ideal for a guy who&#x27;s daily routine includes lathering on a bit of face cream almost as an afterthought before heading out for the day.  </li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  </li>
      <li>With me having really sensitive skin, this does the job greatly.</li>
      <li>The lotion is non-greasy with a very mild smell.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle yet effective.</li>
      <li>This lotion leaves his face feeling good, and not greasy or slimy at all and most importantly for his sensitive skin</li>
      <li>Best men&#x27;s lotion on the market, hands down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as fine a product for men&#x27;s use as I&#x27;ve owned.  </li>
      <li>The Dove Men &amp; Care Sensitive Face Lotion was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He loved the way it felt on his skin, and didn&#x27;t mind the scent, but it reminded me of very old lotion the way it smells.</li>
      <li>and for practical purposes, I haven&#x27;t notice a difference in the effects or the light fragrance of either.</li>
      <li>The lightness also carries into the smell, which is light and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>- No annoying smell at all&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light weight and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>So I cannot say that it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny, but heck, I feel so happy about my facial skin these days....</li>
      <li>This did hydrate my skin as advertised, I found the scent to be light and inoffensive, and the addition of SPF 15 sunblock in the Hydrate formula is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is light and not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a light formula, so you do not feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>wouldn&#x27;t really use their lotion as that didn&#x27;t help me, but this body wash is amazing.</li>
      <li>My need was for a light hydrating aftershave lotion with no odor.  </li>
      <li>It is just lightly scented.</li>
      <li>but once it soaks in it has a nice feel and seems to do a reasonable job of moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>therefore the 3 stars but the price is great for daily use.</li>
      <li>Good product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Extremely sensitive to the skin, plus they smell good</li>
      <li>has a light and clean</li>
      <li>It gives the skin a smooth, matte feel and complexion, doesn&#x27;t shine or take ages to rub in, and makes my face feel almost as clean as if I&#x27;ve just washed it.  </li>
      <li>Not much more to say, but very happy</li>
      <li>Moisturizing and clean feeling</li>
      <li>This is great because my face gets dry after showering and shaving.  </li>
      <li>I have had occasional skin irritation, and my face was usually fairly oily at the end of the day</li>
      <li>He loved it instantly.</li>
      <li>I rated Dove Men care sensitive face lotion 4 stars because it is a nice lotion.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s only fair that we return</li>
      <li>This sensitive face lotion is pretty good.</li>
      <li>This goes on very smooth and leaves a soft, smooth feeling.  </li>
      <li>The fact that it is fragrence neutral and drys quickly is an added benefit.</li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and dries without leaving a greasy feeling.</li>
      <li>This face cream barely has a smell at all which is nice.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product for men looking for a great daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>As I also shave my head and really want to avoid the shiny dome state, I&#x27;m happy to report thus far all of the preceding claims have proven to be accurate for both products although you have to wonder just how much moisturizing your face really needs since the Dove shave gels seem to proclaim they moisturize the face</li>
      <li>It goes on easily and spreads readily upon my face.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which was appreciated.</li>
      <li>The lotion is a very light and soft cream that absorbs in to the skin right as you apply it, also its not greasy at all.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small and stores easily, and when you take the cap off has a nice pump that allows you to easily get the right amount of lotion.&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This beats other lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past for about a 1/4 of the price I&#x27;d spend on them. A little bit is enough to cover half the face, and it leaves your skin breathing without any oil or residue left afterwards. The smell is actually quite pleasant and disappears in a few minutes, definitely not something to go insane about. Use this after a face wash for a perfect combo!</li>
    <li> Not greasy and I only need a little dab to use on my face.  This is great because my face gets dry after showering and shaving.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Best men&#x27;s lotion on the market, hands down. I absolutely hate most lotions, but this stuff is amazing. It is moisturizing while being not at all greasy... not even a little bit. It is just lightly scented. Leaves your face feeling brand new, like you&#x27;ve just gotten out of the shower. I literally cannot emphasize how much I love this face lotion.</li>
    <li> I am 22 years of age with youthful skin, and yet I am plagued by general irritation from all forms of shaving, and hair that tends to grow /sideways/ from the follicle, conveniently (that is, for those demon-hairs who like to come in pairs) producing large, red, raised, and unsightly bumps. -_- sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, when I ran out of face lotion for both post-shave and general-purpose use, I stepped out immediately to replenish my stock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, we begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently picked up this lotion at a certain local store, and after using the product, was compelled to come here to express my thoughts on the matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The core reason for my doing so, is that this product has an odor which, in my (troubled by generally-less-than-distinctive olfactory faculties) opinion, really is /quite/ bizarre...&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can conceive to describe the scent with language follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is that lingering, powdery residue left behind by generic fruit snacks; intertwined with some \\&quot;essence\\&quot; of sour; then further swirled and blended together with the faint, baleful smell of mold, as is manifested on neglected (once used) bath towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can imagine my shock and relative horror as the smell wafted forth from my face, unto my nares. In fact, I would further describe the scent as an \\&quot;offensive\\&quot; one.&lt;br /&gt;Now, being highly allergic to mold in quantities of some substance, I have the unfortunate super-ability to smell mold wherever it breeds... I had a bad experience once.&lt;br /&gt;Point being, it is possible that my notable aversion, perhaps bordering upon actual phobia, has caused me to perceive the odor of this lotion in a way that deviates from \\&quot;the norm.\\&quot; I am curious to see how others describe the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stranger still, I chose THIS lotion because it smelled \\&quot;unique\\&quot; and somehow \\&quot;distinguished\\&quot; while I was at the store, attempting to make a selection. I don&#x27;t know. It is all just so weird.&lt;br /&gt;Even if dozens of females were drawn to the scent of the lotion, I am still not sure that I would get used to the lotion myself.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is an attempt by Dove to edge into that [fashion] scene of \\&quot;French perfumes\\&quot; and the strange ingredients therein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the lotion refreshes the skin immediately upon application, and seems to do what it is supposed to without being excessively greasy, so overall Three Stars.</li>
    <li> Slightly oily but it&#x27;s really good for smoothing and soothing after a safety razor shave.</li>
    <li> Great for travel, ran out too quickly but was great for my face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really into the whole face-cream scene, but I&#x27;ve found this product quite to my liking. It&#x27;s soothing and I always feel like my face is a bit more relaxed after I use it.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face moisturized without that oily/greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance though is rather unpleasant. It says that it has a neutral fragrance, but it really bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not strong enough for others to smell, but for me it was still too much.</li>
    <li> Perfect lotion for after a shave or even just to hydrate your skin. Its very smooth and does not require a lot to cover your face.</li>
    <li> Works good on my husbands face</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this lotion since I think the Dove Men care line is great.  My need was for a light hydrating aftershave lotion with no odor.  This stuff feels thick and greasy going on but once it soaks in it has a nice feel and seems to do a reasonable job of moisturizing.  The problem is a faint nasty odor which hangs in there for several hours.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me but give it a try.  The package is also pretty small for the bucks.</li>
    <li> product received is NOT the product being offered.. ive used this for a couple of years and loved it, however the new stuff has SPF and a very strong fragrance.. im allergic to both. ive re-ordered twice hoping it was a one time mistake but received the same smelly stuff that turns into a white cake substance and clogs my pores. i hope Amazon can figure this out, or perhaps Dove/Unilever has stopped making the good stuff altogether?</li>
    <li> For this being &amp;#34;fragrance neutral&amp;#34; it actually smells pretty bad. It&#x27;s hard to describe, almost like old crayons? I put this on my face and didn&#x27;t really notice at first, then throughout the day I kept getting a whiff of something smelling bad, then I realized it was my face...</li>
    <li> I have occasional bouts of dry skin, particularly in winter of course.  I hoped that this lotion would be a panacea that would fix that, at least for the daylong application.  Well, there are no miracles in over the counter lotions, and this otherwise fine product did nothing to address chronic dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is properly scented, properly greaseless, and easy to apply and store.  It&#x27;s as fine a product for men&#x27;s use as I&#x27;ve owned.  I just wished that it could be applied to the dry/rough skin that some get in cold climates and fix that, at least for the whole day.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of all Dove products. Extremely sensitive to the skin, plus they smell good &#x3D;) I also love how this lotion doesn&#x27;t leave a grease behind. Also, very compact to take with you everywhere you go.</li>
    <li> This is best you can find on amazon in the SPF 15 category. Not just on price, but ingredients as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you want higher SPF, shiseido&#x27;s spf 35 is the best. But is also 10x expensive.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend. He loved the way it felt on his skin, and didn&#x27;t mind the scent, but it reminded me of very old lotion the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Scent was a little weird, and it felt very oily.  Not a huge fan of the pump either.</li>
    <li> i like everything but the smell. Not sure if it reminds me more of dirty socks or parmesean cheese. Would not recommend unless you cant smell.</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. I shave head and face and this soothes the skin perfectly.</li>
    <li> too much fragrance.. i bought it thinking it would be on the lines on the sensitive moisturizer ( w/o spf) with no fragrance..</li>
    <li> A tad bit expensive, but this lotion works fantastically. Not too greasy, but moisturizes well. Will not disappoint, although you don&#x27;t get very much for the price.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this product based on poor moisturizing characteristics and chalky texture.</li>
    <li> My wife used to buy me clinique &amp;#34;M Lotion&amp;#34; since during the dry winter months my face would get dry.  This works better and costs far less.  Been using for 2 months now and it has not caused any break outs or additional pimples.  Not much more to say, but very happy and will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> My dad has very sensitive skin on his face and it&#x27;s prone to being too dry. He won&#x27;t use aftershaves for that reason, preferring a balm or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face lotion has a light, liquid texture and no heavy scent or cologne smells. It absorbs very quickly and it&#x27;s something he will use regularly. The formula is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like a build up or coating on your face. Your face just feels more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with it, it&#x27;s something that he will use and it&#x27;s inexpensive enough that he has no reason not to use it. Having tried it, and letting him try it, this will be a product that he will buy in the future which might help prevent some of the chapping of his nose and cheeks in Alaskan winters.</li>
    <li> My husband is 30, and he has thick, quick-growing hair.  His facial hair is no exception.  He also has sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s been using the Dove Men+Care line of hair/body wash for several months now, and really likes it.  I&#x27;ve also noticed changes too, like his hair is smoother and he no longer gets dry patches of skin on his hands and elbows or any other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Vine offered this same line in facial care products for men, I jumped on all four products for sensitive skin for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them have been no exception to the excellence of the Dove for Men product line.  He&#x27;s been getting less razor burn, he has had less breakouts, and he hasn&#x27;t had any sort of negative reaction to any of the facial care products from Dove.  He also says that shaving has become more comfortable as well.  I&#x27;m not sure how well he notices his skin, but I notice.  I&#x27;ve noticed his skin looking clearer and brighter, and I think they&#x27;ve done great things for his skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a little difficult getting him to use facial care products at all, as he&#x27;s definitely not the \\&quot;metrosexual\\&quot; type, but I think the decrease in razor burn and the other benefits he&#x27;s seeing has convinced him that maybe a decent skincare regimen wouldn&#x27;t be the worst thing in the world.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this face lotion goes in general, it has a nice fragrance, he said it doesn&#x27;t burn or tingle, and I can certainly tell it moisturizes well.  It&#x27;s a great product for sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing it for my husband in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband - his comments are : &amp;#34;Other lotions that I&#x27;ve used either leave my skin feeling hot or oily.  This goes on very smooth and leaves a soft, smooth feeling.  There is a light, pleasant smell - but it&#x27;s not perfumey - which is good.  It seems to last all day - at night my skin still feels moisturized and smooth.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using a bunch of Dove Men Care products lately and what I like about them is they all smell relatively the same.  This face cream barely has a smell at all which is nice. I have sensitive skin that can get really irritated after shaving especially in the winter.  This does a good job at soothing my face without any irritation. My one complaint is with the pump which does not dispense enough cream with each pump, but that is just a minor nuisance.  This is much better than the other Dove  Men Care face creams that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have been a longtime user of Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different lotion. It&#x27;s expensive but everyone always told me it was the best. I have had occasional skin irritation, and my face was usually fairly oily at the end of the day but I just assumed that was normal. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a trial of this product last week and started using it right away as I was almost out of my old stuff. At first I was a little turned off. My skin felt a little greasy after applying the Dove product. Within 5 minutes though the greasy feeling was gone. Moreover, even 24 hours later my skin felt smooth, not at all greasy and &#x27;tight&#x27; in a good way. I have been using this daily since then and note the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - like I said, when I put the product on it feels a little greasy but that is gone in 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;2 - somehow or another my skin does not feel greasy even 24 hours later&lt;br /&gt;3 - My skin is moisturized without feeling moisturized - it is hard to describe the feeling but I like it - a LOT&lt;br /&gt;4 - My skin irritation is gone. No redness around the nose, no blemishes. It&#x27;s 100% better.&lt;br /&gt;5 - No annoying smell at all&lt;br /&gt;6 - With my old product I would get an occasional pimple. None so far with Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I have only been using this for a week. I will update my review after I have used this for a few more weeks. In the meantime, I am downright giddy.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so most of the time, my skin is very dry then becomes very oily. This one really moisturizes my skin. Will stick with it.</li>
    <li> For everyday use this lotion works great. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it leaves any residue.&lt;br /&gt;It has a light and clean feel.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy and keeps my face moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion doesn&#x27;t have a smell which is great in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I have used more expensive lotions that do a much better job therefore the 3 stars but the price is great for daily use.</li>
    <li> This works really really nicely. With me having really sensitive skin, this does the job greatly. The scent is nice and doesn&#x27;t affect my breathing since I have a sensitivity to fragrances. I would recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also did a video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;EVeD-JTo69I</li>
    <li> Feels too heavy and I think it&#x27;s making me break out. I&#x27;d skip this.</li>
    <li> I was willing to purchase this because of the price and reviews.  I purchased Hydrate.  Works great as a facial sunscreen but certainly does nothing for dry skin.  Nothing.  I like the smell out of the bottle but the smell changes through out the day on my skin to an unfaltering smell.</li>
    <li> Works great on my face, doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy, just nice and hydrated. It does have a slight odd odor, not unpleasant and hardly noticeable. I will be buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I went with the sensitive version of this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since it came out and it works great. For be a young guy a suffer from break out sometimes and I also have sensitive skin so I have to watch what I use. This lotion has gotten rid of those pesky dry spots around my chin and leaves my face completely moisturized. The lotion is a very light and soft cream that absorbs in to the skin right as you apply it, also its not greasy at all. Compared to other lotions that leave your face greasy and also don&#x27;t absorb into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I you are going to give it a try I highly recommend dove mens+care face wash 2 great products that any guy should be with out. Since using the dove mens face wash and lotion my face a cleared up and looks great. Give Them A Try</li>
    <li> moisturizer for sensitive skin without sun protection is the biggest oxymoron I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> I exfoliate my face a lot because I have an extremely oily complexion.  Recently, I noticed dry, flaky patches of skin around the corners of my nose, near my nostrils.  This is an example of face dandruff.  I suffered with it years ago and my dermatologist gave me samples of a prescription cream that helped the face dandruff to vanish.  However, I didn&#x27;t have a dermatologist appointment for a long time and needed immediate aid.  One morning, after taking my shower, I dabbed a little bit of the white creamy lotion from my canister of Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Face Lotion, which I had received from the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Within a few days, the face dandruff vanished.  I have been using this precious lotion for nearly two weeks and it hasn&#x27;t reappeared.  This lotion saved me a lot of money.  Now, I don&#x27;t have to go to my dermatologist.  (Even though I have Blue Cross Blue Shield medical insurance, office visits with a specialist are expensive.)  I&#x27;m going to keep the Dove Men+Care Sensitive + Face Lotion in my medicine cabinet in case my face dandruff flairs up again.  Therefore, I would highly recommend this lotion for men who have dry facial skin or raunchy, unpredictable complexions like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph B. Hoyos</li>
    <li> I tend not to use lotion on my face because I&#x27;m afraid of clogging the pores and causing breakouts.  Still, every now and then, my face does get dry enough where I do need a little help keeping it moisturized.  In that instance, I reluctantly use a small amount of Neutrogena face lotion.  I don&#x27;t like using it very much because it&#x27;s greasy.  The Dove Men+Care, however, is not greasy and it helps my face and neck moisturized.  I kind of wish it came in a tube, though.  The mini-can container is kind of bulky and not that great for travel.</li>
    <li> For the last few weeks, I have alternated this product with [[ASIN:B00A0J0A8I Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Post Shave Balm, 3.4 Ounce]] and for practical purposes, I haven&#x27;t notice a difference in the effects or the light fragrance of either. Curiously, while after shave lotions typically contain alcohol the product noted above does not although this &#x60;sensitive face&#x27; lotion does and the product specifically marketed as after shave balm does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each product seems pretty comparable to the [[ASIN:B001FB5IGE Nivea for Men Sensitive Post Shave Balm, Active Comfort System, 3.3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] I&#x27;ve used for years. Each claims to relieve irritation and leave the skin hydrated with fast absorption in a non-greasy formula. As I also shave my head and really want to avoid the shiny dome state, I&#x27;m happy to report thus far all of the preceding claims have proven to be accurate for both products although you have to wonder just how much moisturizing your face really needs since the Dove shave gels seem to proclaim they moisturize the face just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, the two products are pretty close in price (as is the Nivea) and I use only about a quarter size application of either for full coverage of my face AND scalp. Since the other variety lists a weight over double the stated weight of this one, guess which one I&#x27;ll be buying when the time comes, assuming any moisturizing lotion is required after using the supposedly moisturizing Dove shave gels...</li>
    <li> Hubby has sensitive skin and will only use face lotion that is sensitive to his skin. Dove Men+Care once applied to your face has a soft, smooth feel to it. Not much to smell here and what you do smell is fresh. It&#x27;s a great way to keep your face feeling smooth and looking healthy if you have sensitive skin, which a lot of us do.</li>
    <li> The product works well for me with no irritation when compared to the other face lotions. It does not leave an oily residue and it feels refreshing. It is an essential product for all guys out there.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day after my shower.  SO far it has had a wonderful effect on my skin.  Moisturizing and clean feeling, I really love Dove Men+Care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a light formula, so you do not feel greasy.  The lightness also carries into the smell, which is light and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like my skin has gotten better with regular use.  My skin is not dry or greasy.  It is actually getting less sensitive, or so it feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for men looking for a great daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> With the way the wind blows around here. my face is always feeling dry and sensitive. Other lotions don&#x27;t feel as good on my face as they do on my hands, but this lotion feels great. The fact that it is fragrence neutral and drys quickly is an added benefit. You don&#x27;t want to rub your eyes and get lotion in them.</li>
    <li> I passed this along to my 12-year old son. He has sensitive skin and is going through puberty. The lotion is non-greasy with a very mild smell. He loved it instantly. It only took a small amount on his face, he used it after showering in the evening. The next day he used it after washing his face in the morning. Now it has became a daily product and he&#x27;s asked that I keep purchasing it for him. My only issue is that is doesn&#x27;t have any type of UV protection. It is unlikely that he would put sunblock on top of his lotion, so I wish this had some UV protection for him. Otherwise, I will purchase it again simply because he loves the product, the smell is mild and it is gentle on his skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything really different between this and any other conventional lotion, except this one does not threaten your insecure masculinity! All it lacks are some explosions on the label, and maybe a car engine or a hunting rifle. I also eagerly await my NFL-branded version of this.</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband who has problems with redness on cheeks. Seems to keep the outbreaks under control and since he&#x27;s a &amp;#34;manly man&amp;#34; and not use to using face lotion, likes the fact that there is added sunscreen so no need to apply two products. Only con wishes there was a larger size available.</li>
    <li> Nice product but the scent in my opinion doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; but rather a bit medicinal. And since it&#x27;s used on my face, it&#x27;s tough to ignore the scent.</li>
    <li> Good product, doesn&#x27;t irritate my incredibly sensitive skin.**** Although worth noting, the first order of the sensitive lotion  was exactly what I expected in a sensitive lotion( one feature being unscented). But the second order was definately scented. Not strong but noticeable. I was disappointed but luckily it does not have any negative effects on me so for that I was thrilled because otherwise I love this lotion.</li>
    <li> I rated Dove Men care sensitive face lotion 4 stars because it is a nice lotion. It has a nice scent and is non-greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the ingredients are questionable? CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, CAPRYLIC/CAPRIC TRIGLYCERIDE, CETEARYL ALCOHOL, AMMONIUM ACRYLOYLDIMETHYLTAURATE/VP COPOLYMER, PEG-100 STEARATE, SOHEXADECANE, FRAGRANCE, DIMETHICONE, DISODIUM EDTA, IODOPROPYNYL BUTYLCARBAMATE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good lotion, I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily use it on my face because it is not all natural but I have used it on my legs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used so many things, spent $1500-2000 or more on stuff that I quit using before using 1/10th of it because they broke me out or they didn&#x27;t do anything but made my skin worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry flaky skin and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;I had to scrub my face of dead skin every 1-2 days while in the shower. If I didn&#x27;t, my face would look bad because you&#x27;ll notice it flaking. Especially if I ate food. So I had to do this and it wouldn&#x27;t really do it unless I ate a hamburger or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t break me out or give me pimples, which is extremely nice. I used to hate the pimples I have, but over the years, I felt that the dry skin was much worse. It was bad because, I had oily and extremely dry skin in the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product, the very first day, I haven&#x27;t had flaky skin at all. I haven&#x27;t scrubbed my face once of dead skin and I&#x27;ve used this for almost a month now or a complete month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought the facewash and the shampoo too along with the shaving gel of this line. It was like, I had dandruff all over my head and nothing worked at all and whatever I used made my face very shiny, was embarrassing to me. This does make my face shiny too, but the least of all the ones I have used. So I cannot say that it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny, but heck, I feel so happy about my facial skin these days....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one I didn&#x27;t buy of the line was the body wash, if there is one.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought the Aveeno Active naturals skin relief body wash, fragrance free and that helped my body skin too.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t really use their lotion as that didn&#x27;t help me, but this body wash is amazing. I was having pretty dry body skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, it changed my life big time.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. I purchased it just over a month ago, and have been using it 5-7 times a week (2 pumps each use). And it is starting to feel light. I will definitely be buying another bottle, it goes on easy, and moisturizes all day. 15 SPF is also excellent and exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Dove Men+Care Revitalize + Face Lotion is a great lotion with a pleasant smell. It is light weight and non-greasy. After using, my face feels smooth and refreshed, not tight. While aimed at guys, this product works amazing for me as well.</li>
    <li> I recently gave my husband the Dove Men Care face lotion, along with 3 other Dove Men Care products.  Of the four products, he particularly liked the \\&quot;Sensitive Face Lotion\\&quot; and the \\&quot;Sensitive Post Shave Balm\\&quot;.  He says they work great, and leave his skin feeling better and healthier.  He likes the scent, and I do too.  It&#x27;s masculine, but not strong.</li>
    <li> This sensitive face lotion is pretty good. It does hydrate without causing any irritation, but if you have dry skin, it may need to be applied a few times a day. The moisturization seems to be fairly short lived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, you can probably use it just once a day, but if you have dry skin, you may want to look into a different product. This is just a small tube, which is typical for a facial moisturizer, but if you&#x27;re applying more than once a day, it is not going to last very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice that it absorbs quickly, there is no greasy feeling and the skin doesn&#x27;t look shiny, but the moisturization just doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long.</li>
    <li> I am a 50-year-old man who struggles with facial rosacea. I am constantly on the hunt for a lotion that will soothe my face without irritating my skin. Many of the lotions that I have tried make my face burn and itch. Dove&#x27;s new Men Care Sensitive Face Lotion is a godsend. It goes on easily and spreads readily upon my face. It is a thicker lotion, but if you get your face wet before applying lotion it thins it out and you don&#x27;t need to use very much. It absorbs into the skin quickly and dries without leaving a greasy feeling. It keeps my face feeling soft and supple all day long without causing any of the redness that has plagued me for year. I highly recommend this product for anyone who struggles with skin issues. It&#x27;s very gentle yet effective.</li>
    <li> I chose to try Dove Men + Care Face Lotion for sensitive skin because I am always looking for face lotions that are for sensitive skin, and because I use Dove soap for sensitive skin.  The brand name, Dove, remains a trustworthy brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does live up to its claims of reducing irritation and moisturizing the face after a shave.  It is also packaged so that it is convenient to take as part of one&#x27;s shaving gear on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have added it to my various options for an aftershave lotion.</li>
    <li> I have generally oily skin that doesn&#x27;t need a whole lot of antagonism before its turning angry red in parts and horrified white in others. I also live in Seoul, a city with some of the grease-havingest air around. The frequent washings required to keep my skin from feeling coated in exhaust and grime also do a number on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is pretty good. It gives the skin a smooth, matte feel and complexion, doesn&#x27;t shine or take ages to rub in, and makes my face feel almost as clean as if I&#x27;ve just washed it.  My only complaint would be the size -- I hate having to re-purchase lotions; if I like it, I&#x27;d like a CostCo-style vat of it. It also seems to fade pretty quickly on my face. It doesn&#x27;t take two or three hours before I feel like reapplying. Again, given the size, this cuts it down to four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. Wish I had more of it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband and he really likes it. Great for moisturizing dry and rough skin. We live in a humid area, so it&#x27;s important for him not to have to put a heavy lotion or cream on his skin. This lotion leaves his face feeling good, and not greasy or slimy at all and most importantly for his sensitive skin ~ no irritation! Try it!</li>
    <li> Sometimes men get overlooked in the body care department. Of course, lately, it seems companies have recognized the missed market. Maybe men have dry skin on their faces, too? You think? I&#x27;ve been satisfied with the quality of the men&#x27;s care items from Dove and this lotion is no exception. It is light and not at all greasy. It didn&#x27;t upset my husband&#x27;s sensitive skin at all. (And his skin is really sensitive.) It didn&#x27;t look weird or greasy when rubbed into facial hair, either. (Which is a big plus since my husband has a full beard.) It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, which was appreciated. (If every man care item you buy smells a lot, before long you&#x27;re smelling like a junior high boy at a dance.) The container is a bit weird and seemed like a little bit of overkill, but overall this is decent face lotion.</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin has become very skeptical of any name-brand company offering \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; face-care products. It seems like they&#x27;re all loaded with fragrances and harsh chemicals that burn my face red rather than moisturize. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this new product from Dove is actually agreeing with my fair pretty well. And it&#x27;s not even that greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Compatible with my sensitive skin. Haven&#x27;t noticed any redness or chemical burns&lt;br /&gt;- SPF 15 - Not great, but better than nothing&lt;br /&gt;- You can feel the hydration&lt;br /&gt;- Non greasy&lt;br /&gt;- Hasn&#x27;t caused break-outs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Slightly strange scent&lt;br /&gt;- Feels a little weird. Almost kingly, kinda oily.. you just have to remember that it doesn&#x27;t look the way it feels&lt;br /&gt;- Small mount (1.69 oz won&#x27;t last long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL: Although I still prefer my jojoba oil for an overnight moisturizer, I&#x27;m starting to seriously become a fan of this new Dove product. It&#x27;s very hard for me to find a moisturizer that is both non-greasy, won&#x27;t make me break out, and contains an SPF. I give it a solid 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I know that this product is marketed for men, but sometimes I like skin care lines created for the guys; they seem \\&quot;simpler\\&quot; somehow and generally less saturated with fragrance.  Besides, the \\&quot;boys\\&quot; have been borrowing our beauty products for years - it&#x27;s only fair that we return the favor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; formula is strictly a moisturizer.  It contains no sunscreen.  The product is extremely creamy; no watery, drippy mess to deal with.  It absorbs into the skin fairly quickly, though I find that it leaves a slightly \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; feeling on my face.  I have mostly \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type skin with a tendency to get oily in the t-zone.  I find that this product exacerbates the oiliness.  There is only the slightest hint of fragrance; barely detectible.  Slightly more than a dime-sized amount should be enough for the face and neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Not bad for normal or dry skin types, but may be too rich for oilier skins.  If acne is an issue for you I&#x27;d be cautious with this one.</li>
    <li> The package itself is quite well designed.  It&#x27;s small and stores easily, and when you take the cap off has a nice pump that allows you to easily get the right amount of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that it is for sensitive skin, and I understand that&#x27;s probably why there isn&#x27;t any/much scent in it, so for those of you who have issues with that, this will be great.  However at times I wanted it to have a better scent.  It does seem to stay on for awhile, and seems to help soften my skin.</li>
    <li> This pump-container skin cream would seem to appeal to a majority of men. Its faint herbal scent is unobtrusive and the lotion itself is quickly absorbed. It is ideal for a guy who&#x27;s daily routine includes lathering on a bit of face cream almost as an afterthought before heading out for the day.  It&#x27;s a nice lotion, but it doesn&#x27;t hold up for the entire day. Male cosmetic &#x27;aficionados&#x27; would likely want something a bit higher-end than this Dove product. It works for me though. Dove Men+Care feels good going on and is a calming balm to my skin for the 10 hours or so that I&#x27;m out of the house. I wouldn&#x27;t using in the place of an after-shave lotion, but it is soothing as one would expect from a &#x27;sensitive&#x27; formulation. I like the pump-style dispenser, but have found that after it sits overnight, I need to give it a full pump before the next one dispenses any lotion. I have Axe shave lotions in similar dispensers that don&#x27;t suffer from this defect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dove Men+Care is better than many lotions on the market, and at this price point I&#x27;d say it is hard to top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
    <li> This did hydrate my skin as advertised, I found the scent to be light and inoffensive, and the addition of SPF 15 sunblock in the Hydrate formula is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However it left my face feeling oily and unpleasant which I did not care for, and as such I would not use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does tend to the oily side of things, so this may be better for those of you with dry to normal skin types.</li>
    <li> My son has to shave daily as he works in the food industry. Daily shaving can lead to rough, dry skin. With the Dove face lotion he now shaves comfortably since his skin is no longer rough and dry thanks to Dove. Very good product!</li>
    <li> The Dove Men &amp; Care Sensitive Face Lotion was a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: The dispenser is angled up with a thumb-sized depression to allow for easy application in small quantities. The lotion itself is almost completely odorless and is clear once rubbed into the skin.  The lotion leaves the skin definitely softer after use and I&#x27;ve only been using it a few times a week, not daily. The bottle is small enough to be travel size at under 3 ounces but lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
</ol>
