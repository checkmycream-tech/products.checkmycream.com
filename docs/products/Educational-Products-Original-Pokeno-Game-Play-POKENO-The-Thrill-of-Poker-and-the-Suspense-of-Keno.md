    <li> Love this new game, I started a PO KE NO  card club and we have a ball every time we play</li>
    <li> My mom lost her pokeno game in Hurricane Katrina.  She has been looking for another one in stores and could not find it.  I was so excited to find it online.  It made her day.  The game was new and in perfect condition!</li>
    <li> This is a great game. It was shipped in a timely manner as stated. I did not have any problems.</li>
    <li> Great game for the entire family!  Hours of fun.....thanks!  My family and I enjoy game night every Friday night (while the kids are still young enough to enjoy their parents)  Many happy moments!  Thank you Pokeno!</li>
    <li> My family and I use to play this game all the time when I was growing up. I bought this for the game nights that I now have with my family and friends. We love playing this game! This is a very nice set, just like the original one I had growing up. It is great way to get the kids and adults involved in something besides TV and electronic games. I highly recommend this. Shipping was very fast!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with the how quick my item arrived and how smoothly the transaction went.</li>
    <li> We played &#x27;Pokeno&#x27; at my house growing up when the extended family was around.  I loved it then, and my kids love it today.  This is the same exact replica of what we played (40?) years ago, so if you&#x27;re looking for the original, this is it!  As an adult, we have friends over for pot luck and pull this game out.  Men and women alike enjoy this game.  Easy to learn, and everyone will have the rules down after the first game.   Simple, fun, and highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I played this game every week with friends and family. We stopped playing and lost the game. I was very pleased when I purchased it and surprised my family when I brought it to them. We had a great time playing it again. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I received Pokeno a couple of days after i ordered it (it was quick) we played all night long Christmas Eve....... everyone who was over my house ended up ordering it themselves.</li>
    <li> Our son received this as a gift a few years ago and we have really enjoyed it. It is deck-of-cards bingo, in a sense.</li>
    <li> Was glad when the game arrive but was mad when i open it. I had 12 cards but, something was wrong with 2 of them. I had 2 cards with the 8 of spades as the center, and 1 card had 2 five of diamonds on the same card. I will be returing the game and try to order another one hope all the cards will be right!</li>
    <li> Great classic, I bought three! One for me one for my mother and mother in law each. This game is hard to find at this price point!</li>
    <li> My family always play this game every year when we get together for the holidays. We stay up for hours way into the night because we can&#x27;t stop playing it. The cards are large with large printed cards on them, making it easy for ones to see even if they have seeing issues. I would recommend this game to anyone seeking to have tons of endless fun. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> For years we had a Pokeno Christmas Saving  Pokeno Club, the money we saved from Jan. to Oct. each year was used to purchase&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;most of our children&#x27;s toys. Our Pokeno Night twice a month also gave us a rest from the children and our husbands  a real job twice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; a month. DT</li>
    <li> I have had a new group start up and this is great for a fun filled night with the girls</li>
    <li> A big fan of Pokeno, hours of fun!</li>
    <li> love this game.. reminds me of bingo but better.. we play w/dimes per cup but you can play w/more if you want..</li>
    <li> Fun game, glad I brought it.</li>
    <li> aA fun gane to play with family and friend.</li>
    <li> you don&#x27;t see many of the old games around and my friend loves it..she ha been looking for it and was so happy I found it for her.</li>
    <li> I gave a pokeno party and it went well, so I decided to buy my own and have one on July 4th with family &amp; friends. This shall be nothing but laughs. It was a nice price, so I didn&#x27;t see a reason to pass it up.</li>
    <li> OK however I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. I only purchased it for a Christmas Gift for a relative.</li>
    <li> Great game to bring friends together.  If you have a large group, make sure you buy Pokeno 2 (the blue box has different cards) this way you wont have multiple people winning at the same time.</li>
