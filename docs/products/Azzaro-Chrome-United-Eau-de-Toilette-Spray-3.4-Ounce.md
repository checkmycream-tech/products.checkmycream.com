      <li>I preferred the original Chrome.</li>
      <li>fragrance is a flanker of the original Chrome Summer but on a lighter note.</li>
      <li>Quick and accurate...</li>
      <li>this smells amazing on My husband personal Favorite</li>

      <li>Masculine, but not too perfume-y; not musty.</li>
      <li>It was developed by perfumer Richard Ibanez.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

    <li> Great cologne!  I purchased this after a recommendation and everyone on the hospital staff comments on it.  For those who are looking to purchase, it has a very &amp;#34;fresh scent.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved Chrome since my older brother got me a bottle in middle school. But this isn&#x27;t the same. Masculine, but not too perfume-y; not musty. Love it.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve had this Azzaro for some time, people around me like it a lot... and I&#x27;ve bought this one for a friend as he loved it. it is a classic, light aroma, nothing heavy, and the smell will not shock you or those around you. it has a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> A friend reccomended this scent for me.  I probably should have tested it beforehand.  It is not bad, but not really my style either.  I haven&#x27;t received a lot of compliments about it, and even though my girlfriend says it smells nice, I don&#x27;t think she particularly likes it.  Some guys might be able to pull it off better though!  The scent lasts about 12-14 hours on me depending on how much I put on in oone location.  I still have a lot of it left.  I preferred the original Chrome.</li>
    <li> Super Fast shipping! Love this product... Will definitely buy again!!</li>
    <li> great price and smells great!</li>
    <li> Azzaro Chrome United was launched in 2013 as an EDT, available in 50ml and 100ml. It was developed by perfumer Richard Ibanez.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a flanker of the original Chrome Summer but on a lighter note. It belongs to the “woodsy-spicy” scents. Top notes are bergamot, szechuan pepper and coriander. The middle is Ceylon black tea and violet leaf while the base is cedar and white musk. The result is a synthetic ozonic, green, musky, aromatic and aquatic fragrance, of varying intensity, depending on the individual’s skin. Tends to dry down to a soapy, powdery sweet scent; reminiscent of Nautica Blue or Voyage, Bvlgari BLV, Versace pour Homme or Blue de Chanel to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;Chrome United is a spring and summer EDT intended for all demographics but best for mid-teens (especially as a first cologne) to late 20s. Longevity is moderate (6 to 8 hours) and sillage (projection) is average.&lt;br /&gt;When used in the proper season and age appropriate, it is a very good choice. Remember always to TRY BEFORE YOU BUY.</li>
    <li> After smelling a sample I received, I had to get this. My girlfriend can&#x27;t get enough of it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy i got this. Got a lot of compliments first day i wore it. My new fav!</li>
    <li> Great product. Shipping was right on time</li>
    <li> Great scent. Clean and refreshing. My girlfriend loves it. Not a knockoff!</li>
    <li> great scent and great price.</li>
    <li> husband tried this at the store,  I smelled it when he came home,  and really liked it.  Bought it for Christmas for him and we still like it a lot.</li>
