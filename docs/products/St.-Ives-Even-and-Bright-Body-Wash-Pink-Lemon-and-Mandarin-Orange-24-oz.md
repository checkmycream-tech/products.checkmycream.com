      <li>It does have a nice smell.</li>
      <li>I would give it five enthusiastic stars if they qualified for the rabbit logo</li>
      <li>, I guess that&#x27;s a good healthy thing.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a good thing since I don&#x27;t like overly sweet fruity smell!</li>
      <li>Love the refreshing scent, too!</li>
      <li>smells great and works very well tyvm</li>
      <li>but I use with my bath scrubbers and works great highly recommend !</li>
      <li>I like to try different soaps, and this one smells great!  </li>
      <li>The kids have to switch to a more hydrating formula in the winter.</li>
      <li>I got this for almost nothing using S&amp;S and a coupon, but now that I&#x27;ve smelled it, I want to buy more.</li>
      <li>Smells awesome and a big bottle for the price!</li>
      <li>its comes with alot i love it</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing more because I cannot find it in stores around me.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this shower gel.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-drying and the smell is fantastic!</li>
      <li>I bought this from Walmart and loved it from the first moment I used it.</li>
      <li>This body wash has a mild exfoliate as well as a mild, pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>But its actually some good body wash t be so cheap and also smells good.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s kind of drying to my skin and doesn&#x27;t really leave a scent on your skin after you shower.</li>
      <li>Gets me clean, as soap should.</li>
      <li>I recommend it for a clean feeling.</li>
      <li>Definitely a worthy product to use..</li>
      <li>RELAXING AND FRESH</li>
      <li>It smelled really nice in the bottle, but when I actually used it, it felt like I was bathing with dish soap.</li>
      <li>This product is very effective in exfoliating while soothing my sensitive skin, and the price point can&#x27;t be beat, especially discounted on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>The price was right, so I tried it</li>
      <li>Smells a little like chemicals, but good on the skin, and super sudsy.</li>
      <li>I like the aroma first of all.</li>
      <li>and I love the tiny micro beads.</li>
      <li>I saw results in the first week of use.</li>
      <li>This is my third bottle of this scent, love the smell.</li>
      <li>smells good and has a bit of scrubs for removing dead skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of St Ives body wash and can say they have all been pretty great so far</li>
      <li>Kinda more sour and tangy than sweet</li>
      <li>I got it because i loved the smell of the face wash which i dont use because the beads are to small and always get in my eyes and will stay for a whole day or two.</li>
      <li>Then it really helps in skin perfection.</li>
      <li>Really does pamper me</li>
      <li>Really does even and brighten the skin.</li>
      <li>But this is priced rather reasonably</li>
      <li>The citrus smell is very chemical-like and a bit over-powering.</li>
      <li>Whole family uses this and.everyone likes it.</li>
      <li>I bought this mainly because of the price, with these prices it allows me to stock up on hygiene items without having to spend retail store inflated prices.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have not broken out using it</li>
      <li>It is a mild scrub, with small grainy bits to smooth your skin.</li>
      <li>Love st Ives products been using several of them for years this product smells great slightly disappointed in the amount of exfoliating beads</li>
      <li>Seriously, it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and a lot of body washes</li>
      <li>I gave it a 4 star because the smell is a little too strong for me.  </li>
      <li>I have semi sensitive skin</li>
      <li>so you can use it for sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Its not going to give you that ultra soft skin</li>
      <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive,  acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>This scent is appropriate for any age or sex because it is not sweet, heavy, or lingering.</li>
      <li>I personally did not like the exfoliating aspect of this body wash - I use body wash to shave in the shower and the small granules made it more difficult to get a smooth shave.  </li>

    <li> A great value! Love the refreshing scent, too!</li>
    <li> It has tiny little beads which polish the body.  It is not drying and I quite like the feel of it on my body. I gave it a 4 star because the smell is a little too strong for me.  Comparing this body wash with The Body Shop&#x27;s range of fruity shower gel, I still prefer the latter. But this is priced rather reasonably so I will still continue to use this as an alternate body wash to my floral ones.</li>
    <li> Love st Ives products been using several of them for years this product smells great slightly disappointed in the amount of exfoliating beads but I use with my bath scrubbers and works great highly recommend !</li>

    <li> I received this about a week ago and cannot say enough about it.  It is the best.  Helps soften skin and smells great.  I have very sensitive skin and have not broken out using it so you can use it for sensitive skin.  I will be purchasing more because I cannot find it in stores around me.</li>

    <li> I got this for almost nothing using S&amp;S and a coupon, but now that I&#x27;ve smelled it, I want to buy more. Seriously, it smells amazing.</li>
