      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>We LOVE these toothbrushes!</li>
      <li>Cleans better than my electric!</li>
      <li>Yet... the brushes are amazing...</li>
      <li>I bought this toothbrush, and really liked the flossing bristles and silver treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I liked them a lot.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have antimicrobial silver on the bristles, but I wish it was on the handle as well -</li>
      <li>I paid a company $40 for a toothbrush with silver, and while I loved it, the price on these is so much better.  </li>
      <li>these are still great and make my mouth feel clean.  </li>
      <li>I am a true believer in great oral hygiene.</li>
      <li>Till I received those brushes whole family used Phillips Pro 9000 rechargeable brushes, this manual brush gets better  results and teeth feel awesome.</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this tooth brush!  </li>
      <li>Those that have love them too.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the antimicrobial thingys; but when only the best will do, get this brush.</li>
      <li>They leave my teeth cleaned and healthy.</li>
      <li>I have told my family and friends about them and they love it too.  </li>
      <li>even better than my electric, 2-minute timed Sonicare toothbrush, which was maybe $70 when I bought it.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great and don&#x27;t ware out fast.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both love these tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I will always use them.</li>
      <li>Feel free to draw your own conclusions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pretty good.</li>
      <li>Pages 4, 6, and 7 contain information most relevant to humans.</li>
      <li>a 4 pack that lasts a year will surely make you smile!</li>
      <li>I drink coffee, and my teeth stain easily.  </li>
      <li>Now I have been using these for a while... getting different colors ;-) and still very happy with the product .....................................</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now a huge fan.</li>
      <li>Keep them available.</li>
      <li>so I could get free shipping.</li>
      <li>Fantastic toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Love these, they are pefect, soft but every effective cleaning and comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>They have a nice grip and your mouth really feels clean when you&#x27;re done brushing,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually excited about a toothbrush.</li>
      <li>And again, and yep still having that &amp;#34;I just went to the dentist who sandblasted my teeth to get them this clean and smooth.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>since they really get between your teeth and the bristles are very comfortable</li>
      <li>Or better yet, if the industry would come up with non-petroleum/plastic based bristles that worked reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I would recommend them to anyone who wants better than a drugstore toothbrush at a comparable price.</li>
      <li>I used the toothbrush the first time and realized once I&#x27;d rinsed that my teeth felt smooth, squeaky clean even, with no traces of film or food particles still stuck to the surface.</li>
      <li>I liked that they were all different colors  too.</li>
      <li>I got one of these tooth brushes at Whole foods a while back, and loved it.</li>
      <li>These literally make teeth feel squeaky clean, and I love not worrying about contamination on the bristles when traveling or simply when the toothbrush is not being used in the bathroom.</li>
      <li>Felt broken-in right out of the package.  </li>
      <li>Definitely, absolutely, 100% getting more to replace these once they&#x27;re old.</li>
      <li>You see what I did there? ; )~</li>
      <li>Teeth felt polished after first couple of brushings.  </li>
      <li>It appears many companies are switching from nylon bristles, which seem to have been safer, to phtalate based bristles - probably because they last longer.</li>
      <li>As a scientist aware of what they are, I just can&#x27;t keep using anything made with these bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first your gums may hurt a bit, just go a bit lighter until you get used to the brush.</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s all that really matters!</li>
      <li>then I used mine for the first time</li>
      <li>;-)</li>
      <li>My teeth look cleaner and whiter now than they have in a long time and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s a darn fine toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t become flaccid after several uses.</li>
      <li>I really appreciated the antibacterial protection when I was having gum surgery and during flu season.</li>
      <li>It really works.  </li>
      <li>They do feel SUPER clean once you&#x27;re done, and you can feel the bristles deep cleaning under your gums AND between your teeth -- even the molars in the back.</li>
      <li>Upon closer inspection the \\&quot;mottling\\&quot; was actually the stain starting to be removed from my teeth with the job done in 3 or 4 more days.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend them</li>
      <li>its worth the extra price.</li>
      <li>The bristles are fine and soft enough to get into small spaces comfortably.</li>
      <li>I will be going to the dentist soon for the first time since starting with these &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see if they notice a difference.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless, this is the first time I have brushed where my gums haven&#x27;t bled!</li>
      <li>The first time I ordered, I recieved four different colors</li>
      <li>Cured my sensitive gums.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love, love, love this tooth brush!  I&#x27;ve bought 8 for Christmas stocking gifts this year</li>
    <li> I  had looked all over for toothbrushes with the bristles shaped like these.  They work well for orthodontic patients for getting around and under permanent retainers.  It is an added plus that these have the additional value of being antimicrobial as well.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.  Felt broken-in right out of the package.  Teeth felt polished after first couple of brushings.  Am telling everybody I know to try one.  Those that have love them too.  Even got one for my dog, no more fussing.</li>
    <li> These are great brushes! I was worried initially that they would be too soft, but they aren&#x27;t overly soft at all. My teeth feel great after using these. They are worth the extra money knowing they are less germ-infested than the regular toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes we have ever used.  Soft on the gums but not on the plaque.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. Till I received those brushes whole family used Phillips Pro 9000 rechargeable brushes, this manual brush gets better  results and teeth feel awesome. Also, since I have been using it I noticed that my morning breath gone, and brush lasts longer than average.</li>
    <li> I am a true believer in great oral hygiene. These toothbrushes are number one in my opinion.  They leave my teeth cleaned and healthy. That is  not the case with other manual toothbrushes. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is without a doubt the best toothbrush you will ever use. I love it!</li>
    <li> These are a lifesaver, or a tooth saver, or maybe created by a soothsayer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, this is the first time I have brushed where my gums haven&#x27;t bled! They last a very long time (90 days) and are not more expensive than any other toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a no brainer, buy these, a 4 pack that lasts a year will surely make you smile! You see what I did there? ; )~</li>
    <li> I bought these toothbrushes on a whim, probably to fill out an order so I could get free shipping. When I finally got around to trying one, I was surprised by how well it worked. I have alway had problems with tartar build up between my lower front teeth. Since I started using this toothbrush, the tartar problem has disappeared. The bristles were so fine, I did not expect them to last very long, but after a month of regular use, the toothbrush still works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea whether there is anything to the silver particle/antibacterial claims. I just know it&#x27;s the best toothbrush I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush I;ve ever used, get&#x27;s the job done without removing your enamel !!</li>
    <li> No, this didn&#x27;t make my mouth feel like I had just returned from the dental hygienist. However, it&#x27;s a darn fine toothbrush that doesn&#x27;t become flaccid after several uses. In fact, this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. Maybe it&#x27;s the antimicrobial thingys; but when only the best will do, get this brush.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes I have ever used.</li>
    <li> The only place I typically can find these is Wholefoods. These are the same thing and far cheaper per item. As far as the quality goes.... The reach all those crannies and hold up forever. It&#x27;s a win!</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush, and really liked the flossing bristles and silver treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I soon found out the bristles are made with PBT plastic (Polybutylene Terephtalates). It appears many companies are switching from nylon bristles, which seem to have been safer, to phtalate based bristles - probably because they last longer. As a scientist aware of what they are, I just can&#x27;t keep using anything made with these bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you know the research on phtalates&#x27; effect as endocrine disruptors, you know how terrible they are, being associated with reproductive defects, endocrine problems, and cancer. This is well controlled scientific research, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being in the process of cutting BPA, phtalates, and other harmful (most) plastics out of my life, I can&#x27;t really keep using this toothbruth. Plus, if you are trying to conceive or undergo IVF, phtalates can really lower your chances of success, due to causing chromosomal abnormalities (read Improving Egg Quality, and It Starts with the Egg books, all citing solid scientific papers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Mouth Watchers would make these with nylon bristles, I would rebuy instantly. Or better yet, if the industry would come up with non-petroleum/plastic based bristles that worked reasonably well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Based on requests on the comments, here is a link to a 2012 report by the EPA on the effects of phtalates. Pages 4, 6, and 7 contain information most relevant to humans. Feel free to draw your own conclusions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Now I have been using these for a while... getting different colors ;-) and still very happy with the product ..................................... Love the product but unhappy with the colors they send to me the second time. The first time I ordered, I recieved four different colors and I got the same color brushes the second time I ordered. Well... not a great thing for the family of four ;-) Yet... the brushes are amazing... I will have to order again.</li>
    <li> Having killed 2 plug-in, re-chargable (read expensive) followed by 1 battery operated brushes, I decided to try these. I really didn&#x27;t expect much, I mean a brush is a brush right? Wrong! At first your gums may hurt a bit, just go a bit lighter until you get used to the brush. Within a week you should really notice a difference (I think it was less than a week). I will be going to the dentist soon for the first time since starting with these &amp; can&#x27;t wait to see if they notice a difference. Even if they don&#x27;t  I think my teeth feel shinier so that&#x27;s all that really matters!</li>
    <li> Fantastic toothbrush.  Feels good on your gums and you can hear your teeth squeak when brushing.  I don&#x27;t think I can go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Thanks to my Mouth Watchers toothbrush, I spent less time at my dental appointment and received positive feedback on taking care of my teeth.</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I ever used.</li>
    <li> Love these toothbrush&#x27;s!! Will never go back to regular tooth brush!</li>
    <li> So after watching a documentary on bacteria, I learned just how much bacteria gets on a toothbrush over the courae of an average day, and its a lot!!  Hard to believe most people put one of these bacteria-filled things in their mouth and think they are actually cleaning their teeth.  This product eliminates 99%+ of that bacteria and promotes a much healthier mouth and overall health experience.</li>
    <li> Our family won&#x27;t use anything else. This is the only toothbrush that whitened my son&#x27;s (fluoride) stained teeth. Cured my sensitive gums. Cleans better than my electric!</li>
    <li> Loved these!&lt;br /&gt;My dentist was even impressed at how clean my teeth were.&lt;br /&gt;The name brand is the one to buy, I learned the hard way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful toothbrushes. I thought it was an exaggeration by other reviewers to say they left them &amp;#34;squeaky, dentist clean,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s no exaggeration. These literally make teeth feel squeaky clean, and I love not worrying about contamination on the bristles when traveling or simply when the toothbrush is not being used in the bathroom. I&#x27;m actually excited about a toothbrush. didn&#x27;t think that would happen!</li>
    <li> This was a great idea. The bristles are fine and soft enough to get into small spaces comfortably. I really appreciated the antibacterial protection when I was having gum surgery and during flu season.</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrushes money can buy!  They have a nice grip and your mouth really feels clean when you&#x27;re done brushing, since they really get between your teeth and the bristles are very comfortable</li>
    <li> Love these, they are pefect, soft but every effective cleaning and comfortable to hold</li>
    <li> Pretty good. I bought these for the entire family. They were good quality and I liked them a lot. I liked that they were all different colors  too.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, my teeth AND my son&#x27;s have become whiter... I think my boyfriend&#x27;s too (though I look in his mouth much less...). They do feel SUPER clean once you&#x27;re done, and you can feel the bristles deep cleaning under your gums AND between your teeth -- even the molars in the back. Helps resolve gingivitis conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this manual brush (and it&#x27;s price!) even better than my electric, 2-minute timed Sonicare toothbrush, which was maybe $70 when I bought it. Definitely, absolutely, 100% getting more to replace these once they&#x27;re old. Awesome!</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love these tooth brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I will always use them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice to have antimicrobial silver on the bristles, but I wish it was on the handle as well - which is not immune from germs.</li>
    <li> I got one of these tooth brushes at Whole foods a while back, and loved it. It is the perfect softness for great brushing. Great for your teeth as well as your gums. Hard to find at all Whole foods, so since then I have been getting them from Amazon. Keep them available.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I bought some for the antimicrobial benefit of silver.  I drink coffee, and my teeth stain easily.  I was not satisfied when the stain removal after my last dental cleaning.  But, to my surprise, after 10 days or so of using the toothbrush the stains started to look mottled.  Upon closer inspection the \\&quot;mottling\\&quot; was actually the stain starting to be removed from my teeth with the job done in 3 or 4 more days. My teeth look cleaner and whiter now than they have in a long time and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
    <li> Our dentist introduced us to the toothbrush. The bacteria killing feature is great. It also is the best manual toothbrush our family has I  ever used. It really works.  Jim Martin</li>
    <li> My husband loves these toothbrushes.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants better than a drugstore toothbrush at a comparable price.</li>
    <li> The build quality is really good. They compete with GUM toothbrushes and I believe are really good. Highly recommend them</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever! I will never use another brand or type.  Oh man, this gets between the teeth like you won&#x27;t even believe. I have told my family and friends about them and they love it too.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever.</li>
    <li> We LOVE these toothbrushes! And I was thrilled to find them here on Amazon!</li>
    <li> These make my gums feel so good!</li>
    <li> These are the best toothbrushes ive had.  They last at least 3x longer than a regular toothbrush so its worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> I have never bought toothbrushes online, but made an exception for these.  They&#x27;re great and don&#x27;t ware out fast. Have had them for a few months now.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrushes ever!!</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes make your mouth cleaner.  I paid a company $40 for a toothbrush with silver, and while I loved it, the price on these is so much better.  Even though they are soft bristled and I prefer medium or hard these are still great and make my mouth feel clean.  Try it!</li>
    <li> What is it about these toothbrushes? I mean, when I opened them I was sort of disappointed. They look like ordinary run-of-the-mill toothbrushes. They don&#x27;t even vibrate, spin or use sonic powers to get your teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I used mine for the first time and I understood the difference. Normally, even when I use my Sonicare brush I have to go over my teeth several times, floss and then go over them again. Sorry to be graphic, but I have teeth with a lot of space for things to catch and as a result no, they just never feel all that great even when they are clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now. I used the toothbrush the first time and realized once I&#x27;d rinsed that my teeth felt smooth, squeaky clean even, with no traces of film or food particles still stuck to the surface. I couldn&#x27;t stop running my tongue over the teeth, just trying to figure out if I was simply imagining things. So I tried it again, same result. And again, and yep still having that &amp;#34;I just went to the dentist who sandblasted my teeth to get them this clean and smooth.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final consensus: These things work like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen or experienced before. I&#x27;m now a huge fan. And yes, it does look like my teeth are writer now.</li>
