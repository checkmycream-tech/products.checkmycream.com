      <li>A lovely, fragrant, clean smelling perfume that really agrees with me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent</li>
      <li>If you like a light, fragrant, pretty smelling perfume you would want to try AV By Adrienne Vittadini for Women.</li>
      <li>Then people wrote about loving it and the company bought it back.</li>
      <li>It is light but very classy and can be worn for any event.  </li>

      <li>a classic!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very hard to find them in the stores now-a-days; therefore I have been able to find at Amazon and if I&#x27;m able buy two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Delivered fast and to my door.</li>
      <li>first off the color was off....too clear.</li>
      <li>Guess it&#x27;s time to seek out a new fragrance that wasn&#x27;t discontinued years ago!</li>
      <li>Decent scent for the price...</li>
      <li>Because of the nature of the item (liquid?) it can only be shipped via ground service and therefore took much longer than 2 days to arrive</li>
      <li>Of course, if you live closer to the point of shipment origin, you may get it faster than I did (about a week later).</li>
      <li>Love the scent, but poor spray pump.</li>

<li> I was delighted to see it again on Amazon, bought it and was sorely disappointed.  </li>
<li> This was bought a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Still have.</li>
<li> but doesnt stay too long.</li>
<li> Will continue to use this and other products from Amazon.</li>
<li> but something&#x27;s just not right.  </li>
<li> Hard to find.</li>
<li> Like no authentic , is false</li>
<li> Amazon&#x27;s price is definitely less expensive than retail.</li>
<li> Saying it is eligible for Prime is false advertising, in my opinion.  </li>
<li> For a while I was giving it as gifts, but it has gotten too expensive.  </li>
<li> THIS IS FAKE!</li>
<li> Sort of like opening a bottle of wine that has gone bad.  </li>
<li> this should have been in the description.....very disappointed.....</li>
<li> Call me crazy, but I have been wearing this fragrance for close to 15 years (yes, well before it was discontinued!)</li>

    <li> smells great on the wife...</li>
    <li> I have worn Adrienne Vittadini for five years and always get compliments on the scent.  It is light but very classy and can be worn for any event.  Amazon&#x27;s price is definitely less expensive than retail.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this Perfume by some friend as a present one Christmas in 1995.  Ever since, when I walk by everone must make a comment on how clean, fresh and wonderful I smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very hard to find them in the stores now-a-days; therefore I have been able to find at Amazon and if I&#x27;m able buy two at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great, did take that long and when I got home my package was there, very happy. Very successful purchage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank yu.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes... great price for the size of the bottle. I am very satisfied and will re-purchase again.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but I have been wearing this fragrance for close to 15 years (yes, well before it was discontinued!) and this recently opened atomizer just doesn&#x27;t smell the same.  I have always loved this fragrance because of its subtlety, but this &amp;#34;batch&amp;#34; is an overly powerful floral.  Don&#x27;t have a clue why, but something&#x27;s just not right.  Sort of like opening a bottle of wine that has gone bad.  Guess it&#x27;s time to seek out a new fragrance that wasn&#x27;t discontinued years ago!</li>
    <li> A lovely, fragrant, clean smelling perfume that really agrees with me. I just love this perfume. However, we all know that perfume has to agree with your body sense and what smells good on one person may not smell good on another. I often get asked what perfume I&#x27;m wearing when using AV.For a while this perfume was discontinued and I searched and searched for it and couldn&#x27;t find it. Then people wrote about loving it and the company bought it back. If you like a light, fragrant, pretty smelling perfume you would want to try AV By Adrienne Vittadini for Women. Just the best!</li>
    <li> Love the scent, but poor spray pump.</li>
    <li> A great product at a good price. Delivered fast and to my door. I would deal with this person again. Thank-you for helping make my wifes Christmas better.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. I am glad to get it here!</li>
    <li> The spray nozzle became clogged quickly but, I love AV so, I made it work!</li>
    <li> Awesome as expected thanks again, this is my mothers favorite, I will order again...</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance and price.</li>
    <li> I wore this scent for years until it disappeared from brick-and-mortar stores, then bought it online several times until it disappeared entirely.  I loved it, everyone told me I smelled wonderful, and then it was gone.  I was delighted to see it again on Amazon, bought it and was sorely disappointed.  The product I received has almost no fragrance, and what fragrance it has is not AV.  I was duped, won&#x27;t ever buy fragrance online again.  Shame on you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I just love this crisp fragrance and can&#x27;t believe what a good deal it is here.  After testing it out for a week, I went and bought another before the price goes up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRIME MEMBERS NOTE:  This item says it is eligible for Prime but don&#x27;t be fooled. Because of the nature of the item (liquid?) it can only be shipped via ground service and therefore took much longer than 2 days to arrive (I am in CA).  I actually had to contact Amazon to find out what was going on.  Saying it is eligible for Prime is false advertising, in my opinion.  Of course, if you live closer to the point of shipment origin, you may get it faster than I did (about a week later).</li>
    <li> Good product have used in the past. Will continue to use this and other products from Amazon. Enjoy the Adrienne Vittadini products.</li>
    <li> Like no authentic , is false</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne of all time.  Hard to find.</li>
    <li> Not the fragrance I thought it would be.  This is the reason I don&#x27;t like buying online.  I prefer to shop in person.</li>
    <li> AV is the best.  I love the fragrance and get compliments all the time.  For a while I was giving it as gifts, but it has gotten too expensive.  I hope they continue to make it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  So soft and beautiful fragance</li>
    <li> very good quality, fast shipping</li>
    <li> Use this perfume for years and always do the biggest economy to not end! Now that I know seeing here on Amazon, it was much easier!</li>
    <li> It is the BEST perfume ever! The smell is wonderful and everyone asks me what kind of perfume I wear. I will highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I order this for my beautiful wife, she love it so much</li>
    <li> I have worn AV every day since 1994....I know the scent and it last on me.  Many daily compliments.  I knew immediately that this was not AV....first off the color was off....too clear. not to mention the scent was EWWW!!!  I cannot return if it seems for a refund.  Watch out Amazon shoppers....this should have been in the description.....very disappointed.....</li>
    <li> Excellent service and price.</li>
    <li> THIS IS FAKE! I&#x27;ve been wearing AV for over 10 years almost daily. It&#x27;s not a bad scent but it&#x27;s not my AV!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorites...a classic!  I always have this as a part of my selections.</li>
    <li> Decent scent for the price...but doesnt stay too long.</li>
    <li> This was bought a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;Still have. My favorite scent.</li>
    <li> I love AV.  One of my favorite scents.  Happy to see it offered through Amazon and still great quality</li>
    <li> I would consider giving this as a gift.</li>
    <li> Got this lovely fragance for my mom. I am so glad I did is not too strong just perfect for her.</li>
