      <li>So much more gentle on my face and definitely better at picking up trace makeup and any impurities that I want to get off before applying nighttime serums and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the most high maintenance thing about them :)</li>
      <li>So worth the money!  </li>
      <li>I made that mistake by accident and the cloths shrunk to about 1/2 the original size.</li>
      <li>I use one cloth in the AM and get a clean one in the PM.</li>
      <li>i just don&#x27;t,) that have effectively exfoliated my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have read a lot about cleaning your face with Muslin, and it was very inexpensive for 10 of them, so I tried them and LOVE them.</li>
      <li>Turned out not to be what I was looking for but not a bad product.  </li>
      <li>My first set of cloths were nice a bit rougher than my 2 order where I order about 3 packages, they were much softer and the pink stitching was almost quilted like, very nice.</li>
      <li>These rinse out easily and provide gentle exfoliation and stimulation.</li>
      <li>I use a new cloth every night and my acne-prone skin has improved significantly!</li>
      <li>They gently exfoliate and leave my skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
      <li>They are gentle for washing your face, but lightly exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>These are fantastic for gentle exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I ordered for hot-cloth cleansing and must use two to retain enough heat to ge effective.</li>
      <li>No shrinking so far :)</li>
      <li>i would recommend trying the product for the sole reason out of how courteous the seller is--</li>
      <li>These cloths are a more realistic size to cover your whole face.  </li>
      <li>The texture is just right.</li>
      <li>Honestly I use the same one for weeks, it dries out so fast</li>
      <li>Run hot water over a muslin cloth, squeeze out excess water, and hold it on the face for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
      <li>I will be recommending to friends and will likely purchase more in the future.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>After washing my face, I wet one of these with warm water and use it to wipe off the cleanser, then toss it in the hamper for that week&#x27;s laundry.</li>
      <li>I knocked a star off because I wish they were a touch bigger, but the size was prominently displayed so I knew what I was getting.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first steps cleans skin and pores.  </li>
      <li>These are the perfect weight for using w your expensive cleansers.</li>
      <li>I got these cloths to dry off and exfoliate my face after I wash, and I&#x27;m really happy to say that they&#x27;ve essentially replaced my Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>These are simple, clean, soft enough, and are good washcloths for cleaning my face.  </li>
      <li>I feel like these are better suited maybe for use on a baby or young child, not for a grown adult to wash their face.  </li>
      <li>These little cloths have just the right amount of texture to give a nice exfoliation, no pulling, tugging or hurting the skin.</li>
      <li>I have noticed a big improvement in my skin as well, and they are easy to wash and re-use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my decision to try these out and highly recommend for anyone trying to reduce waste and save money.</li>
      <li>I really like using these cloths.</li>
      <li>Provide gentle exfoliation and remove eye make up well.</li>
      <li>Very durable.</li>
      <li>Thin, affordable, and perfect for gentle facial cleansing.</li>
      <li>They are much thinner than a wash cloth, more like the texture of a bandana, but are still absorbent and soft enough to feel gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>however, i don&#x27;t actually need to do so, as it came precisely as anticipated.</li>
      <li>These just felt way to gentle on my face and didn&#x27;t remove makeup very well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other muslin cleansing cloths before and they are more exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>I will probably buy a second pack just to make sure I have enough between laundry days.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>neatly folded muslin cloths (that i&#x27;ve found oddly hard to find in the states, despite my searching--and i do not want to cut and sew my own from a craft shop...</li>
      <li>Love these thin, quick drying, cloths for washing my face.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that using these cloths with my regular cream cleanser provides just the right amount.</li>
      <li>They dry quickly, provide very gentle physical exfoliation, and they&#x27;re affordable enough to have several weeks worth of clean facial cloths when using a new on every day.</li>
      <li>(I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>After washing once though they became very soft.</li>
      <li>so they get double washed in hot with cloth diapers.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty thin and not the most durable thing out there.</li>
      <li>No shrinkage as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>negative is that they wrinkle up in the wash, but I bought them for function more than form.</li>
      <li>Not as soft as eve lom cloths, but at this price, I can deal.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I got these cloths to dry off and exfoliate my face after I wash, and I&#x27;m really happy to say that they&#x27;ve essentially replaced my Clarisonic. The price is really affordable, and these are good quality. I&#x27;ve been really happy with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve followed the reviews and have been handwashing them with Woolite in my bathroom sink. That&#x27;s the most high maintenance thing about them :)</li>
    <li> great product for face</li>
    <li> Great exfoliating wash cloths.  Wash and clean easily.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Thinner than others I paid more for, but still get the job done. Better than staining other linens for sure &amp; size is ideal for make up removal.</li>
    <li> quick delivery but a little thin</li>
    <li> Love these. I&#x27;ve tried muslin cloths from all price points and these are solid. Like, as good as the one&#x27;s that cost $20 for three cloths (you know the ones). Gentle, effective, sturdy. Just don&#x27;t throw them in the dryer!</li>
    <li> These are simple, clean, soft enough, and are good washcloths for cleaning my face.  I can use each one once and throw it in the laundry which is better for clearing up acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that they wrinkle up in the wash, but I bought them for function more than form.</li>
    <li> Nice product with nice hem. I like the idea of using a Muslim cloth. Face seems cleaner. Just a little luxury I treat myself to.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> These were slightly rough to the touch when they arrived. After washing once though they became very soft.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from these. I have read a lot about cleaning your face with Muslin, and it was very inexpensive for 10 of them, so I tried them and LOVE them. They are good for exfoliating, good for scrubbing and removing your make-up, and wash up easily when you&#x27;re done. Don&#x27;t throw them in the washer/dryer (I understand they shrink to tiny), but no need to if you wash and hang after each use. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> one of the most amazing sellers i have encountered on amazon. i would recommend trying the product for the sole reason out of how courteous the seller is--however, i don&#x27;t actually need to do so, as it came precisely as anticipated. neatly folded muslin cloths (that i&#x27;ve found oddly hard to find in the states, despite my searching--and i do not want to cut and sew my own from a craft shop...i just don&#x27;t,) that have effectively exfoliated my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would not--absolutely not--wash these cloths with fabric softener (actually, i wouldn&#x27;t wash anything but t-shirts and jeans with fabric softener, but that&#x27;s a story for a different day,) and i would recommend you use a delicate cycle with a mesh bag (honestly, i keep about a gamillion of those around for anything that looks even remotely fragile, from thong underwear to sheesh...you name it.)</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Exactly what I needed, arrived promptly as described. These cloths do distort slightly after washing (really if you put them in the dryer.) Gentle to use and have become softer over time which makes them great for removing eye makeup. I use a new cloth every night and my acne-prone skin has improved significantly! I will be recommending to friends and will likely purchase more in the future.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These are quite nice! I washed and dried mine before using And they held up well.  They are gentle for washing your face, but lightly exfoliating.  They feel good on my sensitive skin.  I use them with warm water to remove a cold cream type cleanser and my face feels amazing afterward.</li>
    <li> These work nicely, I use it as part of my face washing routine. Good size and gentle on skin (I have very sensitive skin and these don&#x27;t bother me at all). One warning, don&#x27;t wash and dry like I did! Hand wash and air dry ONLY! I made that mistake by accident and the cloths shrunk to about 1/2 the original size. OOPS!</li>
    <li> Excellent little face cloths. I have delicate soft skin even some body and facial loofahs are too rough for me, so I&#x27;m careful. These little cloths have just the right amount of texture to give a nice exfoliation, no pulling, tugging or hurting the skin. I now I have purchased 5 maybe 6 packs of them. I may get more I adore them. They are easy to launder I put them in the lingerie bag and throw them in with my whites. Tumble dry low. No shrinkage as far as I can tell. I use one cloth in the AM and get a clean one in the PM. My skin, neck, decollete area all looks smoother and brighter. This is in a few weeks of daily use. These are perfect very pleased with the quality. Shipping from oversea not too bad 4 and half weeks is the longest I&#x27;ve waited that was at holiday time, normally about 3 weeks wait. I will recommend if you want multiple packages order at the same time from the same seller. These cloths appear to have different manufacturers. My first set of cloths were nice a bit rougher than my 2 order where I order about 3 packages, they were much softer and the pink stitching was almost quilted like, very nice. Keep that in mind. Think you&#x27;ll be pleased with these cloths.</li>
    <li> I really like using these cloths. I have combination/sensitive skin, so dealing with clogged pores AND dry skin without setting off a reaction is a bit of a trick. I do need some exfoliation, but it&#x27;s hard to find the right level. I&#x27;ve found that using these cloths with my regular cream cleanser provides just the right amount. I use them just once each to avoid bacterial build-up and they are fine to chuck in the washer/dryer with the rest of my laundry. I will probably buy a second pack just to make sure I have enough between laundry days. I knocked a star off because I wish they were a touch bigger, but the size was prominently displayed so I knew what I was getting.</li>
    <li> There are good for me! I like！</li>
    <li> The texture is just right. Not too rough not entirely silky either. I have to say, it&#x27;s pretty thin and not the most durable thing out there. But I&#x27;m not sure what the typical strength or durability of muslin cloth is.</li>
    <li> Love these. Thin, affordable, and perfect for gentle facial cleansing. They dry quickly, provide very gentle physical exfoliation, and they&#x27;re affordable enough to have several weeks worth of clean facial cloths when using a new on every day. Easy to launder, and any residual makeup or cleanser doesn&#x27;t leave any stains behind.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect weight for using w your expensive cleansers. The cleanser gets on your skin, not absorbed into the fabric. These rinse out easily and provide gentle exfoliation and stimulation.</li>
    <li> These are a little thin but hold up well in the wash so far. I&#x27;m using them as cloth baby wipes so they get double washed in hot with cloth diapers.</li>
    <li> Love these thin, quick drying, cloths for washing my face. Feels like old time diaper material.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  The edges are finished, which is a nice touch.  Perfect for cleansing the face.  I got the idea for these after trying out Eve Lom facial cleanser with a tiny muslin cloth.  These cloths are a more realistic size to cover your whole face.  Steps I use are based on Eve Lom&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Apply cleanser to dry or moist face as desired (I use almond + olive + coconut oils blended, but you can use foaming cleansers if needed)&lt;br /&gt;2. Run hot water over a muslin cloth, squeeze out excess water, and hold it on the face for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3. Repeat step 2.&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinse the muslin cloth again and start wiping off the remaining oil/cleanser on the face.&lt;br /&gt;5. Run cold water on the muslin, squeeze out excess water, and hold it on the face for 5 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;6. Repeat step 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first steps cleans skin and pores.  The last steps help close the pores on your face.</li>
    <li> I got these as a substitute for disposable facial wipes, and they work perfectly. After washing my face, I wet one of these with warm water and use it to wipe off the cleanser, then toss it in the hamper for that week&#x27;s laundry. They come out a bit wrinkly after washing but are durable and hold up otherwise, and since I&#x27;m just going to wet and crumple them up again I leave them as they are. They are much thinner than a wash cloth, more like the texture of a bandana, but are still absorbent and soft enough to feel gentle on my face. I&#x27;m very satisfied with my decision to try these out and highly recommend for anyone trying to reduce waste and save money.</li>
    <li> These facial cloths are as nice as others I have from expensive brands.  They wash nicely although they shrink a bit.  Provide gentle exfoliation and remove eye make up well.</li>
    <li> These muslins clothes are amazing for the price. They&#x27;re very thin as most muslin clothes are but so gentle on the skin. I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
    <li> these things are awesome! I love them. Honestly I use the same one for weeks, it dries out so fast and I use it in the bath and then rinse it thoroughly with soap when I&#x27;m done with it, then I throw it in the laundry machine. Great.</li>
    <li> Turned out not to be what I was looking for but not a bad product.  I feel like these are better suited maybe for use on a baby or young child, not for a grown adult to wash their face.  I&#x27;ve purchased other muslin cleansing cloths before and they are more exfoliating.  These just felt way to gentle on my face and didn&#x27;t remove makeup very well.  Maybe good for someone with really sensitive skin?</li>
    <li> Excellent for gentle exfoliation. Very durable. Would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Not as soft as eve lom cloths, but at this price, I can deal. I wash mine in the laundry washer along with delicate clothing in cold water, air dry takes less than half hour. No shrinking so far :)</li>
    <li> These are a bit thinner than expected, and the shrank in the wash to doll sized. I ordered for hot-cloth cleansing and must use two to retain enough heat to ge effective. Next time I will order inexpensive white napkins instead.</li>
    <li> Nice quality not flimsy at all</li>
    <li> I LOVE THESE! I used to use a konjac sponge, but those would dry out so quickly and felt harsh on my skin. These are perfect! They gently exfoliate and leave my skin feeling silky smooth. I use a makeup remover wipe to take off my makeup, and then I use these cloths and I am amazed by how much makeup is still left. I have noticed a big improvement in my skin as well, and they are easy to wash and re-use. I got all my friends to start using them and have converted every one of them!</li>
    <li> These Muslim cloths were just what they said they were.</li>
    <li> Very soft and wide. I used these for cleaning my face and they are perfect.</li>
    <li> Love these cloths. So much more gentle on my face and definitely better at picking up trace makeup and any impurities that I want to get off before applying nighttime serums and moisturizer. Highly recommend buying several due to the affordable price point.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic for gentle exfoliation. So worth the money!  Great value, but shipping was FOREVER!</li>
