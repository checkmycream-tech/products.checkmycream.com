    <li> Exactly what it says it is.</li>
    <li> As advertised just what I expected.</li>
    <li> Great product at a good price</li>
    <li> Great price... great product!</li>
    <li> I used to like Oral B Essential Floss a lot and used it for years every night, but I still had gum issues. My dentist recommended this one to me. After using it for a few weeks, my gum issues were gone. Compared to Oral B essential, this is thicker and the material feels like cotton. It requires a bit more effort to get in/out between the teeth than the thin/plastic Oral B essential, but it is worth the effort, and I got used to it quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have used it for a few years, and would not switch to any other floss.</li>
    <li> Great product, as expected</li>
    <li> Just exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a nice product conveniently designed that does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price on my first order. When I went back to purchase some for my sister 2 weeks later, they doubled the price!! Im shocked that a large company like Johnson and Johnson are being so greedy like everyone else on the net.</li>
    <li> Excellent - as I expected.  I am unable to find this in stores any longer.</li>
    <li> This floss is great. It&#x27;s getting hard to find. They must be planning to change the product or maybe just change the packaging.</li>
    <li> This floss, Reach Gentle Gum Care, is exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s two soft strands of floss together with a mint flavoring. It is really gentle on sensitive gums.</li>
    <li> I received my order earlier than stated and was very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the woven!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this floss, and I have tried them all.  I am addicted and it makes my teeth cleaning much quicker!  I was given a sample pack at the dentist office for a specific area I have trouble with but use it throughout my mouth and it is very effective.  I searched Amazon because not all stores carry this product and I was tired of looking locally.  God Bless Amazon!</li>

    <li> This floss is the best! It does a great job cleaning in between your teeth. The woven floss cleans better than any other kind of floss. And it really is gentle on the gums- no more bleeding! I cannot find it anywhere. I wonder if it&#x27;s not being manufactured anymore? Why does this always happen to a product that I absolutely love?! I was thrilled to find it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> An old standard.  Great product!</li>
