    <li> little goes a long way, not too foamy, my gums are so much healthier, i would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> repeat buying ... same good quality of product and shipping service.</li>
    <li> The mint flavor is mild.  It foams a little, but not too much.  Mouth feels refreshed when finished. The price is right!</li>
    <li> great i will never use anything esle</li>
    <li> My hygienist is always pushing flouride-ridden toothpastes and giving me samples to use that claim major tartar control results.  I&#x27;ve been using need-based toothpastes and Manina in particular for the past 18 months and have not told my hygeinist simply because I don&#x27;t want the fluoride lecture.  Since swapping, she has told me at each 6 month cleaning appointment  what a good job I&#x27;m doing at home and how little work she is having to do to clean my teeth.  Using the major advertised brands before and flossing as I always have never got this kind of consistent praise about the at-home care I&#x27;m giving my teeth until now.  I particularly like the taste and texture of this toothpaste more than some other neem formulas. I am a believer in the effectiveness of neem and will not switch back to the fluoride pastes as long as I continue to get these results.</li>
    <li> I love this tooth paste taste great leave your breath refreshed.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste tastes great and works well for sensitive gums.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years and haven&#x27;t had any cavities.. so it really works!</li>
    <li> This toothpaste contains sodium lauryl sulphate but many experts say that it is not harmful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main ingredient in this toothpaste is neem and neem products are recommended by Dr&lt;br /&gt;Oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 12-14/13: I have been using it a few days and it seems OK.</li>
    <li> Bye bye regular toothpaste…this neem toothpaste is great! Went for a regular checkup and came away with fantastic results. Get some</li>
    <li> received shipment in  a timely manner. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing. Just from switching to a Neem based toothpaste, my gums are super healthy. No more puffiness...and it tastes just like any other mild mint toothpaste. No weird flavor or anything. I may try other Neem based products. If they work as well as the toothpaste, that will be another great discovery.</li>
    <li> Excellent tooth paste, very nice quality.  Keeps your teeth very clean.  I like the savings benefit from buying the multiple packs.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does a good job. Taste good.</li>
    <li> I have used this toothpaste for several years. It has resulted unhealthy gums &amp; good dental check- ups. Worth a try for anyone whose gums tend to bleed,</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste without fluoride. Cleans teeth well.</li>
    <li> i will get to this quickly and simply because this is a must buy !!! i have gum issues and teeth problems and i saw on dr.oz a woman that had mouth hygiene issues and dident floss like me , so i decided to look it up and now that i have been useing it my gums are getting so much better and my teeth feel dentist clean, the taste leaves some to be desired for some people i gave a tube to my mom and she doesnt like it but it is fine to me, so i feel EVERYONE should only use this its all natural and the best toothpaste i have ever used period i will not go back to commercial brands next i plan on buying more neem based products like mouth wash and other hygiene products thank you so much to the makers i am now a loyal buyer of NEEM !!!!</li>
    <li> Got more relatives to start using Neem, they love it.</li>
    <li> I will continue to purchase Neem as my toothpaste of choice, and would recommend it without hesitation or reservation to anyone wishing a natural product.</li>
    <li> It has a great mint flavor and it makes my teeth feel smooth after brushing. The cost is great when you buy the six pack.</li>
    <li> Best toothpaste ever. I was told by my dentist that I would need to have my  front two teeth pulled. Started using this product over six months ago. Last checkup no problems.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  It is the best&lt;br /&gt;toothpaste on the market.&lt;br /&gt;The 6 pack was almost out of date!&lt;br /&gt;I guess that is why the price was great.</li>
    <li> Great toothpaste. Good for your gums.</li>
    <li> I would never have purchased this if the ingredients were listed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use sodium lauryl sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sodium lauryl sulfate is made from coconuts so legally there is no misinformation but morally there is.</li>
    <li> This product has saved my mouth, after much dental surgery I suffered from gum bleeds almost daily until I started using this product.. My mouth is the healthiest it has ever been..</li>
    <li> This toothpaste works pretty well and leaves teeth feeling very clean. It does not freshen breath immensely, but leaves breath ok.</li>
