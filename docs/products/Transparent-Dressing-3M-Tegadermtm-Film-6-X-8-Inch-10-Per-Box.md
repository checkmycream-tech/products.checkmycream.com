### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very Happy</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>I love Aamazon!!!!</li>
      <li>I purchased it to cover my mother in law&#x27;s drain to her kidney, perfect size and makes showers a breeze.  </li>
      <li>Best price I could find.</li>
      <li>and it kept wound from contact with sand salt and water perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Word to the wise though, DON&#x27;T use gloves when applying the Tegaderm!  </li>
      <li>Thank you for great service</li>
      <li>This stuff is really great.  </li>
      <li>Great for converting my husband&#x27;s wound so he&lt;br</li>
      <li>Put this over it with a bit of Neosporin, and within days the wound looked better, and was healing perfectly.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I wanted to comment that I received an authentic Tegaderm package with Made in the U.S.A. Tegaderm Film enclosed.  </li>
      <li>top it off,</li>
      <li>They work great, easy to put on and keeps my bandage dry and comes off easy.</li>
      <li>Great size for back surgery.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed at a Great price and a super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>i rarely read instructions, however.</li>
      <li>Seemed only fair to update the reviews and say I got the real thing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product to use when looking to tape down gauze pads for any large wounds.  </li>
      <li>it is easy to open and apply and i never read the instructions.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The wound healed to new skin with no scabing in 11 days.  </li>
      <li>Whereas a Tegaderm dressing, when properly applied, can last well over a week without any peeling, the no-name substitute might last a day or two before one or more of the 4 sides begins peeling.</li>
      <li>We take a paper towel and fold it to the size of the port dressing and then cover the port dressing with the paper towel and then cover the whole lot with the larger Tegaderm.  </li>
      <li>Following the reviews I was skeptical of ordering, but decided to do so anyway, because I was willing to try any product since I have adhesive allergies and didn&#x27;t even know if this will work for me, authentic or not.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> Dressing worked like a charm and delivery was as promised..</li>
    <li> I got the Tegaderm Dressing for my girlfriend who recently had a back surgery.  The product works like a second skin.  It&#x27;s a great product to use when looking to tape down gauze pads for any large wounds.  Word to the wise though, DON&#x27;T use gloves when applying the Tegaderm!  It sticks to the gloves and warps the Tegaderm to the point that you can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My husband had a hip replacement, and the nurses used this film in the hospital to keep his bandage dry when he showered. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Thank you for great service I love Aamazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Just what the doc ordered !</li>
    <li> Item arrived promptly as described.  I purchased it to cover my mother in law&#x27;s drain to her kidney, perfect size and makes showers a breeze.  With Tegaderm there is no worry that water will seep into drain area.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed at a Great price and a super fast delivery. Very Happy</li>
    <li> I used this to heal very bad &#x27;road rash&#x27; from a bike crash where I ended up sliding along the road at 25 mph.  Part of my hip had no skin left.  I got some silvadene 1% cream to put on the wound and then covered it with tegaderm.  You can shower with it on.  Initially I had to change the dressing twice a day until the wound stopped weeping.  Then no dressing changes needed during the last few days.  The wound healed to new skin with no scabing in 11 days.  Initially I thought I was going to have to have a skin graft because the wound looked so bad.  This stuff is really great.  It is the only product I would use for bad skin wounds.</li>

    <li> I purchased this after a nasty bit of road rash following a fall off my bike.  Local pharmacies didn&#x27;t sell any sizes over 4 x 4 which was not large enough for my needs.  I haven&#x27;t used the product yet, but I wanted to comment that I received an authentic Tegaderm package with Made in the U.S.A. Tegaderm Film enclosed.  The packaging isn&#x27;t identical to the picture (it&#x27;s a slim paperboard envelope, not a box), but it is not an imitation product.  Following the reviews I was skeptical of ordering, but decided to do so anyway, because I was willing to try any product since I have adhesive allergies and didn&#x27;t even know if this will work for me, authentic or not.  Seemed only fair to update the reviews and say I got the real thing.</li>
    <li> I had a motorcycle accident, got some wicked road rash. Put this over it with a bit of Neosporin, and within days the wound looked better, and was healing perfectly.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Great for converting my husband&#x27;s wound so he&lt;br /&gt;Can shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this product again for my wife to help cover transdermal patch. This batch seems not to keep out moisture as well as previous lots. Having to use 2 films to protect patch.</li>
    <li> I got these for my wife who has cancer and has a port in her chest.  We use these to cover the port dressing so she can shower.  We take a paper towel and fold it to the size of the port dressing and then cover the port dressing with the paper towel and then cover the whole lot with the larger Tegaderm.  Works like a charm!</li>
    <li> Used as a waterproof bandage cover for a burn wound while swimming in the Atlantic for a week.  We changed dressing once a day and it kept wound from contact with sand salt and water perfectly.  (absolutely no leakage when put on BEFORE suntan lotion applied!)</li>
    <li> This is not a 3M product as pictured but a knockoff brand instead. Not something you want for medical care.</li>
    <li> The supplier, Buffalo Hospital Supply, did not deliver Tegaderm 4x8 dressings, but instead substituted a Tegaderm-wannabe from China -- without contacting us an asking whether that would be acceptable. Whereas a Tegaderm dressing, when properly applied, can last well over a week without any peeling, the no-name substitute might last a day or two before one or more of the 4 sides begins peeling. We always have to add some adhesive tape to the entire side to maintain the dressing. At the price we pay for these dressings, we need to get some longevity from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, when the product was delivered we were told that there would be a partial refund for the change. HOWEVER, we never received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are not happy with this company and don&#x27;t plan to use them again.</li>
    <li> Great size for back surgery.</li>
    <li> Best price I could find. I use them to cover a chest cath while I shower. They work great, easy to put on and keeps my bandage dry and comes off easy.</li>
    <li> Occlusive, vapor permeable, film dressing. ... What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> These were delivered as expected.</li>
