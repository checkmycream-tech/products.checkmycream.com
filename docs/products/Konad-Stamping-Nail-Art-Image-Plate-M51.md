<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The designs on this are great and we&#x27;ve used them multiple times.  Thank you for this great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have had great results with this plate. The image quality is great and the creative possibilities are endless withthis plate.</li>
    <li> Fun and easy to do. Looking forward to trying more plates and special polish colors. Simple. Quick. And pretty too.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED THIS IMAGE PLATE FOR IT HAD SOME REALLY NEAT DESIGNS ON IT AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THIS MAKES SUCH NEAT IMAGES ON YOUR NAILS.  YOU REALLY NEED TO GRAB ONE OF THESE FOR YOUR COLLECTION.  I GIVE THIS IMAGE PLATE # M51 5 STARS.  ENJOY!</li>
    <li> The designs are too small for y bail bed but they work well</li>
    <li> Took too long to get. The prints are cute!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but it works great. Pretty easy to use with a bit of patience. I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Had problems with every image on this plate.  I tried using several different types of stampers and polish including, Mundo de unas and still could not pick it up. Maybe just a defective plate.  Would have returned it but several of the images (or something close enough to them) have shown up on other plates I&#x27;ve bought since this purchase so I got rid of it.  If you&#x27;re just starting out, I would avoid THIS particular plate</li>
    <li> Stamping is fun and a great way to make my nails pop.  It does take some practice, so don&#x27;t give up</li>
    <li> Their plates and designs are really awesome. Make sure when you are using the plates that you also purchase the Special Konad polish to use with the plates. You will get some really great results when you use their special polish. I have tried regular polish with the plates and I personally prefer the Konad special polish. Its all well worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, even though I am using the Konad nail polish and the polish is brand new...some of the stamps woth the thinner lines as details don&#x27;t stamp properly.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and transfers are great. I love this plate and its design, the images are unique and pretty.</li>
    <li> have gotten a fair amoutn of use out of this, Konad is definately good quality - tip, their polishes are good but you can use other polishes too</li>
    <li> I love the Konad plates and stamper.  This particular plate doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m using Konad polish and everything, but the swirl pattern doesn&#x27;t transfer properly.  I&#x27;ve never had problems with other plates though.</li>
    <li> This item does exactly what it is supposed to do. If you need something like this, you will not be disappointed in this item.</li>
    <li> When I received this item I was very impress with the quality and the Images are so nice on my nails!  One of my very favorite ones, I have other but this one I love the images.</li>
    <li> Really love Konad plates.  This is really a very nice plate with great designs.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but can&#x27;t wait to do so.</li>
    <li> The plat arrived bent so I was worried but the patterns I wanted it for works just fine. Considering it works, it&#x27;s too much of a hassle to send it back for a new one. The plate images work well with my Konad Double-sided Stamper plus Scraper so no complaints other than the imperfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love konad nail art. It&#x27;s so fun and easy. This stamp works great. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far and I&#x27;m SO excited to use more of the designs.</li>
    <li> Works well, scratches easily though. I will use an old store card instead of the Konad scraper.</li>
    <li> Its a bit difficult to use, the designs do not always come out clean on the nail. I  tried to use it only a few times and gave up.</li>
    <li> I purchased 2 of this brand.  One with small designs and one with larger designs.  They both are very nice and transfer beautifully.  These are nice plates.  I will continue to purchase from this brand.  They are sturdy and have many to designs.  They arrived without damage and the edges are not as sharp as some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard great things about konad .... When I got this in the mail it was in good condition and it works really well ...... Stamps on well on your nails</li>
    <li> Love it, nice and big images.  A must buy!!!</li>
    <li> my daughter and i love these. just dont forget to wash the polish off the plate between use with polish remover (get the pure acetone at walgreen or cvs).</li>
    <li> item as described! mom loved it!</li>
    <li> Great product with clear images. Would definitly buy and use product again.Amazon offers low prices and stands behind my purchase. Thanks for having a service we can trust.</li>
    <li> The wave pattern is my favorite, and looks good with light green and blue polish.  The wider stripes are a bit harder to get because sometimes the scraper gets into them and takes out the nail polish.  Be very careful to keep the scraper about 60 degrees from the surface of the plate and sweep it across quickly.  With a bit of care, these will look really cool.</li>
    <li> I love this one for my toes because it has larger images and matching smaller images! Perfect for each toe!!! Of course it works for finger nails as well! :)</li>
    <li> I really like all the Konad plates and products!!!  They work great and every time.  We can do nail art on a customer in less than 10 minutes on all 10 nails!</li>
    <li> this is my first one and love it the designs are variable in size enough for large and small nails</li>
    <li> This particular plate I have been wanting for a while. It has great detailed designs. I look forward to using this plate closer to spring.</li>
    <li> After buying a pack of off-brand plates, I finally shelled out the cash for the Konad version and now I&#x27;ll never go back. Superior quality, clean images without imperfections, larger than all the others (though -1 star because they&#x27;re still a little small for my thumb/big toe--I assume it&#x27;s for Asian hands).</li>
    <li> I really like the plate, stamps nicely onto nail and the designs are very cute!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect addition to my collection!</li>
    <li> i loved this plate, had some problems ith oth plates, but never had any problems ith konad plates.&lt;br /&gt;just ordered 2 new plates from them and i cant wat to start stamping...</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Does not always give a good print when using their polish :(</li>
    <li> As usual, another quality plate from Konad.  I have tried other brands, but Konad has been the only brand that gives me consistently sharp, complete stamps.  I bought a set from Red Angel and felt totally ripped off because of the poor stamping quality.  Konad might cost more, but you get what you pay for.  I LOVE the swirl pattern - it looked great on my nails, and I got a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> I love all of the intricate detail on this plate. I&#x27;m always able to get the full image to transfer onto the stamper. My one complaint is that the full nail image does not cover my entire thumb.</li>
    <li> Just got the konad stamping set and some plates Im not a professional but it isn&#x27;t hard konad plates are really nice</li>
    <li> i got this because of the swirl patterns, not much into the flowers :P&lt;br /&gt;They work great and the colors stand out very well. Its also nice to have a big and small one each for thumbs and pinkies.</li>
    <li> Was a little surprised on how small the plate was but after trying it out am very happy with it.  It works great, and creates nice crisp images.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite stamping plates, it works wonderful and is made really well. I use it with Konad brand tools and polishes.</li>
    <li> Very pretty designs and fun to use.  Easy!  Love all 3 plates! Good quality and great value. They don&#x27;t get scratched like others I have.  Durable material and so well made, designs come out clear on my nails.</li>
    <li> Love this stamp plate! Design comes out very detailed on nails (used konad black). I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great quality and beautiful sharp images.  I especially love the design that looks like waves or water.  The thin lines come out really crisp.</li>
    <li> Konad stamping plate M51 is one of my favorite plates. It has the full nail with a lot of swirls, and large flowers and the small flowers that you can use in many different designs. I would recommend this plate to anyone who like nail art and nail stamping.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the swirl pattern and it did come out really great. I think the flowers will be useful too. The stamping is not too hard either. If you don&#x27;t already have a stamper make sure to get one too. And I just use a old gift card to scrape the plate.</li>
    <li> Great designs. Stamp so beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love the konard plates. I have tried seaveral others they don&#x27;t work. These are the only ones that seem to do what they&#x27;re made for. The seller shipped it fast and it&#x27;s not a bad price.</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected ;)</li>
    <li> Love the designs on this plate! Practice makes perfect with any Konad plate! I like that some of the floral patrerns are bigger on this plate.</li>
    <li> Great plates, as I&#x27;ve come to expect from Konad.</li>
