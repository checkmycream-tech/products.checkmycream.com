    <li> Love it.  Works great.</li>

    <li> Good replacement.  They do the job and are less expensive that what I found in the store.</li>
    <li> Love this one its small but powerful and does the job well. The really great things are its rechargeable and affordable. Good real for its price.</li>
    <li> They put two of these in my callis remover and they do not even fit that make/model</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use yet as the rollers that came with the Micro Pedi...</li>
    <li> So far  it works fine.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but had an Amazon gift card I needed to spend so I decided to try this. I am a nurse and I am on my feet all day plus I LOVE walking around my house bare footed. Does not matter the time of the year. I tend to get rough dry skin and a few minor callouses. I have the manual scrubbing wands to remove the skin but it can be a pain because it takes a while. I also often forget to use them. I don&#x27;t go regularly to get pedicures so this was a reasonable option to me. I can use on both feet without the battery running low. You can&#x27;t use too much pressure or it will boggle the machine down. The rotating disc is easy to remove and replace.I bought an extra set of replacement disc&#x27;s.  Fast shipping and item was  as described.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had to replace the one that came with the unit yet!</li>
    <li> excellent product...easy to use...and it works!!!!</li>
    <li> I bough these with the Ckeyin foot smoother device. I actually use the one it came with remove it for washing and replace with one of these. I didn&#x27;t want to have to search for them after mine wore out so I just bought the extras when I bought the device. They placed them right in with it packaged bubble wrap which was slightly confusing at first. I thought i didn&#x27;t &#x27;re sieve them but i guess coming from China they do things a bit different . Well worth the price although you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be like a dollar a piece or something but nothing is these days so you really caveat 4.99.&lt;br /&gt;Comes in handy like I said I wash one pop another in and back and forth I go.&lt;br /&gt;Well worth it instead of having to wait for one to dry. Work great.</li>
    <li> Works great and would recommend.  Use them everyday and wow what a difference they make.  Not ashame to wear sandals now.</li>
    <li> Very happy with its performance.</li>
    <li> Wear very quickly. Seems I only get one use before having to change. That can become very expensive.</li>
    <li> juat as it was listed, works great.</li>
    <li> I was extremely pleased with the product.. I made a good decision to purchase it.</li>

    <li> Fast delivery- sure they are fine, haven&#x27;t had to use these as I am still on the original stone for the unit- See my review for the Ckeyin  ® Powerful Rechargeable Electric Foot Spa Smoother /Pedicure Kit /Foot Care Kit /Callus Skin Dead Skin Remover / grinding foot control- Original Retail Package - if you are having to replace your stones often- there is a simple solution to not have to replace the stone continually.</li>
    <li> I love the way it removes the dry skin. will reorder.</li>
    <li> They work alright for maintaining smooth feet but not for getting rough callused feet ready for summer.</li>
