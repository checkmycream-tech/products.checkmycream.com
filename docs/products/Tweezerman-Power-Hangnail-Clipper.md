      <li>The build is quite strong and is able to hold up to thick nails.</li>

      <li>I really like and trust their product line.</li>
      <li>/&gt;it really works&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
      <li>Thank You so much &#x3D; gloria.</li>
      <li>and I made sure that I packed them with our other items.  </li>
      <li>They are extremely sharp and I can now safely clip hangnails.  </li>
      <li>terrific and able to be very specific about what I want to clip...easy to hold</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would still recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

      <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>When you are handicapped you have more trouble returning them</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not sharp enough to cleanly cut my hangnails.</li>
      <li>The blade is quite sharp and leaves a smooth cut for both nails and cuticles.</li>
      <li>all had the same problem--they were hard to manipulate and apply sufficient grip to cut easily and accurately.  </li>
      <li>Very sharp and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is very sharp and can cut the smallest hangnail easily.</li>
      <li>It exactly the same with the photo they post up.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to my friends, thanks!</li>
      <li>I just love this product, nail clippers in general are so small and sometimes slip away from your hands, with this extended handle its so much easier to use.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to get all those little hangnails and cuticle skins.</li>
      <li>you are not familiar, this makes trimming the edges of your nails easy.</li>
      <li>Works very well, only gave 4 stars since the long handle does not come off and sometimes it would be better without the long handle.</li>
      <li>they are large enough for her to&lt;br /&gt;get</li>
      <li>Super sharp.  </li>
      <li>I love these angled clippers to trim hang nails and other dry skin around my nail beds.  </li>
      <li>do not leave where young children can get ahold of them.</li>
      <li>This on has an extended handle that completely solves that problem.  </li>
      <li>Great for cutting hang nails &amp; trimming other very tricky corners, in grown toenails etc.</li>
      <li>; guarantee, you dull them, they sharpen it for free.</li>
      <li>Save your money they barely even cut.</li>
      <li>Hard to get excited</li>
      <li>I really like it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay as sharp as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
      <li>I opened 1 pair &amp; discovered they were not sharp enough to cut my hangnails that I get from picking at my cuticles.  </li>
      <li>I end up tugging on my hangnails because the clipper is not sharp enough.</li>
      <li>I was looking forward to extra handle for leverage, no such thing, not sharp or pointy enough to do the job.</li>
      <li>if clipping dead skin, be careful not to cut too deep, those sharp blades are angled in more than one direction.</li>
      <li>I would prefer the black plastic extension that is on the bottom half to also extend on the top half for easier use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is by far above what I expected from a cuticle clipper. I really like the extended handle added for a better grip. I have bought several other cuticle clippers, just to have them come apart from being to loose. I have much confidence in this product being a better quality.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations at all. Who ever was inspecting this did not check it very well. It does not cut right. It is also ruff on the edge that is next to your skin. Not happy with this prodcut al all.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to fund an angled clipper in the U.S. This is a very nice, very sharp, clipper. With the sturdy black extension, it&#x27;s easy to hold, and approximately twice the size of a typical nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not familiar, this makes trimming the edges of your nails easy.</li>
    <li> Works very well, only gave 4 stars since the long handle does not come off and sometimes it would be better without the long handle.</li>
    <li> i have had to use it several times&lt;br /&gt;it really works&lt;br /&gt;all the other clippers did not work&lt;br /&gt;I need a freind to help me</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work so I returned them. You have to push really hard to get them to clip.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. This is just a typical pair of tweezers with a long handle on one end. The other handle is still slippery and difficult to use.</li>
    <li> Great clippers if you are in to detail.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this product locally for a long time, Was thrilled with the delivery time and very impressed with the cost of the item itself. Will be ordering more often.</li>
    <li> These are the best cuticle clipper anyone could ask for.</li>
    <li> I have been using these clippers for years. There&#x27;s a reason they are called \\&quot;power\\&quot; clippers.  They are very sharp and with the angled head it&#x27;s easy to get all those little hangnails and cuticle skins. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These tweezerman power hangnail clippers are wonderful and I&#x27;m so glad that I choose these to order.  I have showed them to alot of people at work and they want to order some for themselves.  They are so easy to hold and control with this handle attached to the clippers themselves.  I want to order a few extra pairs for my family members now.  We are on vacation now and I made sure that I packed them with our other items.  I hope that everyone who reads this and orders these is as happy with them as we are.  Thank You so much &#x3D; gloria.</li>
    <li> Why is it so difficult to find a nail clipper that is sharp enough? This is a terrible product. It&#x27;s not sharp enough to cleanly cut my hangnails. I&#x27;m better off just leaving the hangnail there...</li>
    <li> This clipper is VERY sharp, and definitely cuts hangnails well. I found the length of the long handle a bit odd to maneuver but I can&#x27;t beat the close, clean cut.</li>
    <li> Awsome for ingrown toe nails.  It has a very sharp edge which akes it easy to get to those hard edges of the nails. Life saver</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the long handle, but it actually make the clippers easier to control... especially with my left hand.</li>
    <li> I used to have a nice pair of angled clippers for many years. One day they broke and I was so upset. I looked in all the stores but nobody had any, so I turned to Amazon. I wish I would have kept looking because these are cheap junk. Save your money they barely even cut. I wish I could give it less than one star.</li>
    <li> Work well but be careful they are sharp</li>
    <li> This little tool keeps hangnails at bay. High quality as you can expect from Tweezerman products. I really like and trust their product line.</li>
    <li> I just love this product, nail clippers in general are so small and sometimes slip away from your hands, with this extended handle its so much easier to use. I have arthritis, this works for me, I find it to be of good quality, I plan to purchase more.</li>
    <li> cheap junk, does not grab or really work. I was looking forward to extra handle for leverage, no such thing, not sharp or pointy enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only needed to use this once, but it worked perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends, thanks!</li>
    <li> Great little hangnail clippers, I keep one in my purse at all times to I don&#x27;t pick or bite at my cuticles.  Very sharp and precise​!</li>
    <li> Love the power clipper...I lost the one I had and could not find it in a store so I bought it on line...terrific and able to be very specific about what I want to clip...easy to hold</li>
    <li> The best clippers I have ever bought , so worth the price , this is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the best hangnail clipper I have ever used.  It is very sharp and cuts closely to the skin.</li>
    <li> This hangnail clipper is very sharp. It gets into every location around the nail. It has a large handle. It does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I end up tugging on my hangnails because the clipper is not sharp enough. Just use bathroom scissors if you can keep yours sharp.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed thought they would be like  Tweezerman Hang Nail Clipper with Case &amp; they were nothing like them  I guess Ill keep these too.  When you are handicapped you have more trouble returning them</li>
    <li> Very sharp!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Purchased these clippers for my wife and she is very pleased with them, quick delivery. they are large enough for her to&lt;br /&gt;get a grip on even with swollen hands,</li>
    <li> Great for cutting hang nails &amp; trimming other very tricky corners, in grown toenails etc.</li>
    <li> This clipper is well-constructed -- very comfortable to the hand and easy to control -- but the blade could be sharper. Using it to trim some skin tags, it took an extra snip or two to do the job, which of course multiplies the times you have to feel the pain of the snip.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several similar items over the years . . . all had the same problem--they were hard to manipulate and apply sufficient grip to cut easily and accurately.  This on has an extended handle that completely solves that problem.  Super instrument!!!</li>
    <li> Works OK on finger nails, but not so good on thick toe nails.</li>
    <li> it is good and arrived faster than expected.</li>
    <li> Hard to get excited but it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I love these angled clippers to trim hang nails and other dry skin around my nail beds.  I cannot maneuver the cuticle trimmers that nail technicians use very well, so these do the trick.</li>
    <li> I carry this around in my purse. It is very sharp and can cut the smallest hangnail easily. At first it seemed awkward because of the long handle. However, after using it several times I got used to the extra length and now like it.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but it doesn&#x27;t stay as sharp as I&#x27;d like.  Maybe it&#x27;s my hangnails because i have this problem with all of them.  It is way better than the non-tweezerman brands!!  I would still recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> not very sharp but ok. The angle is perfect.</li>
    <li> these things reality work great.I should have bought some of these years ago.</li>
    <li> Best hang nail tool!!!!</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and it&#x27;s the best I ever had!  Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have only used this item a few times now but its overall quality appears to be above average. One thing to note is that the points of the cuttings edges are quite sharp, so you need to take care not to pierce the flesh under your nail, like I did. But, once you figure out how to not poke yourself, these clippers allow you to get into the tiniest of cracks to get at stubborn nails. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had plenty of others like this that I&#x27;ve lost over the years, but this one was the sharpest and easiest to use. The long black plastic extension actually did make it easier to use.</li>
    <li> Super sharp.  Love the extended handle.  Love this style of cuticle trimmer but couldn&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.  Thank you Amazon! and at a great price for a quality Tweezerman product.</li>
    <li> Product was as described, prompt shipping. My hands look fantastic now that those unruly hangnails and cuticles are bring managed!</li>
    <li> while it can be a little awkward to hold at certain angles, the sharp angled blades work very well at clipping anything in the way. the extended handle helps keep my hand from cramping and gives more leverage. if clipping dead skin, be careful not to cut too deep, those sharp blades are angled in more than one direction. do not leave where young children can get ahold of them. i would buy them again.</li>
    <li> Not the best blade on this one.  Snagged a few times and made the situation worse.</li>
    <li> Great clippers at a reasonable cost. Very sharp. This was my third purchase (lost the others).</li>
    <li> This is a great improvement over the classic nail clipper for two reasons.  I am able to hold it with ease and the pointed design allows for exact trimming.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this one. It exactly the same with the photo they post up. And cheaper than nail supply place</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 pairs of the Tweezerman Power Hangnail Clippers.  I opened 1 pair &amp; discovered they were not sharp enough to cut my hangnails that I get from picking at my cuticles.  When I went to return them I was told there was a return fee but they would waive it for me this one time.  The return was over a week ago, have not heard anything regarding the refund.</li>
    <li> These are great for cuticles and hang nails. Very sharp and easy to use. Easier to get in those hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> I bought it for myself ,and it is wonderful and easier to hold then the other type .....</li>
    <li> They were originally sold as cuticle trimmers. They make the job so easy. When it was time to replace them, they are now marketed as hangnail clippers. They still work great.</li>
    <li> I did not want to get these because I had toe nail clippers. These were well worth the purpose. they are sharp and accurate no tearing and my cuticles are the best they have been in years.</li>
    <li> I have really enjoyed these clippers.  They are extremely sharp and I can now safely clip hangnails.  Thank you Tweezerman!</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Love this product, have many, at work, purse, home...Best for clipping hangnails.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!  I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m not in any way affiliated with the seller / maker of this product *</li>
    <li> Perfect clipper option for hangnails and cuticles. The short angled clipper blade is perfect to get into very tight situations with hangails. The build is quite strong and is able to hold up to thick nails. The blade is quite sharp and leaves a smooth cut for both nails and cuticles. I would prefer the black plastic extension that is on the bottom half to also extend on the top half for easier use.</li>
    <li> Did the job it is intended for.</li>
    <li> The sharpest cuticle cutter I have ever used/seen/heard of.  Backed by Tweezerman&#x27;s &amp;#34;sharpen for life&#x27;&amp;#34; guarantee, you dull them, they sharpen it for free.</li>
    <li> This product is had to use, especially if you have arthritis and it is dull! It was disappointing - I would not buy again.</li>
