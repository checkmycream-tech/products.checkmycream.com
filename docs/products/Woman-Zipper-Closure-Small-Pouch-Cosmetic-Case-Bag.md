      <li>cheap, but actually not bad considering what i paid for it.</li>
      <li>Great little bag for ladies incidentals :)</li>
      <li>This is really nice and perfect for makeup and other things and it came earlier than it said it would.</li>
      <li>The bag is very spacious and cute</li>
      <li>This pouch keeps all of my cosmetics right at hand and readily available.  </li>
      <li>Its a cute pink colored bag that functions as you would expect a bag of this kind to.  </li>
      <li>filling for stockings stuffers love all the colors, blue my favorite.</li>
      <li>Great big enough for my makeup love it</li>
      <li>I only gave it two stars because the fabric is nice.</li>
      <li>Good quality, doesn&#x27;t smell even with wet item use.</li>
      <li>right here.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>ITS JUST RIGHT</li>
      <li>Love love amazing product for an unbelievable price!!!</li>
      <li>The mirror isn&#x27;t good quality, and the material that its made of is just average.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great it has lot small compartments along with a large compartment.</li>
      <li>Is nice and exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>I was surprised that the outside of it was so nice,</li>
      <li>I bought this pink cosmetic bag a few months ago, and it&#x27;s perfect for me.</li>
      <li>Nice little bag for travel..good for lipstick, moisturizer, etc.. when traveling or at home</li>
      <li>however, the pockets in the inside are very flimsy and look like they could break soon.</li>
      <li>It literally went straight in the trash</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>Shipping- fast, during a reasonable amount of time</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much better quality than expected!</li>
      <li>What I received was a VERY nicely constructed cosmetic bag worthy of an asking price of at least $20, I spent $3.</li>
      <li>and that is why i love it so much it took a little time to come</li>
      <li>I was very surprised!</li>
      <li>TOO HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS LITTLE POUCH</li>
      <li>Lovely little bag.</li>
      <li>Mirror broke but love my little bag as I keep all of my files and nail clippers.</li>
      <li>and I love the little mirror.</li>
      <li>i thought it would break in a day, but it&#x27;s actually held up pretty well.</li>
      <li>Works great for me, with the little make up I do wear and even have extra room for other things.</li>
      <li>Great price, nice size makeup bag, but when it arrived today, the little mirror attached was broken, Amazon did offer to refund me if I will send back the item, but that means waiting and be home for ups to pick up or packaging and taking to the post office myself, not worth the hassle for a $6 item</li>
      <li>It looks very durable and should last a while.</li>
      <li>but by far not a bargain by the time you paid S/H it came to about $9, could have gotten it from any Drug Store.</li>
      <li>The part near the zipper.</li>
      <li>Big enough to fit my makeup and small enough to fit in my bag.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a medium size make-up bag, pretty pink</li>
      <li>The zipper broke the first day, and it is not as roomy as I expected.</li>
      <li>I got hot pink!</li>
      <li>The outside is slightly plastic but feels more like fabric than I expected.</li>
      <li>Very small, and easy to travel with.</li>
      <li>in fact i might actually purchase it again as a small diaper pouch to fit inside my purse.</li>

    <li> Great price, nice size makeup bag, but when it arrived today, the little mirror attached was broken, Amazon did offer to refund me if I will send back the item, but that means waiting and be home for ups to pick up or packaging and taking to the post office myself, not worth the hassle for a $6 item, I&#x27;ll just keep it and not have the mirror. bummer :(</li>
    <li> I ordered this to personalize and give to my bridesmaids... it&#x27;s much better quality than expected! The outside is slightly plastic but feels more like fabric than I expected. I&#x27;m happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great little bag for ladies incidentals :)</li>
    <li> I love this so much ! The color is awesome and the material is just wow . Thank you amazon :)</li>
    <li> much better in person</li>
    <li> Is nice and exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> Use for my toothbrush. Good quality, doesn&#x27;t smell even with wet item use. Glad I bought 2.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest and cheesiest looking bag. It literally went straight in the trash</li>
    <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;the color is pretty&lt;br /&gt;I thought it&#x27;s small but all my stuff fitted in :)&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
    <li> Its a cute pink colored bag that functions as you would expect a bag of this kind to.  The mirror isn&#x27;t good quality, and the material that its made of is just average.  The zipper works without fail.  Overall, its not a top of the line makeup bag, just a nice affordable bad to hold your contents for now.</li>
    <li> Lovely little bag. Well made too. I was expecting something to look a bit cheap cause it costed so least. I was very surprised! The material is well made.</li>
    <li> The bag is very spacious and cute but when I got it the color wasn&#x27;t the one on the picture and i really wanted it in that pink and the threading seems to come off the bag</li>
    <li> The zipper broke the first day, and it is not as roomy as I expected. I only gave it two stars because the fabric is nice.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS LITTLE POUCH ITS VERY SMALL BUT NOT BIG EITHER I GUESS ITS THE PERFECT SIZE, BECAUSE FOR ME THE BIGGER IT IS THE MORE I WANT TO PUT IN IT.. BUT NOT WITH THIS ONE..ITS JUST RIGHT AND A LOT OF STUFF FIT IN IT TOO HIGHLY RECOMMEND. A BAD THING WAS IT TOOK A MONTH AND A COUPLE OF DAYS TO GET HERE. :(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This is a cheaply made piece of junk.  The zipper was stuck halfway when it arrived.  I asked to return it and the answer was send a picture.  I threw it in the trash.  This is not a reliable seller.  Take your business elsewhere.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size! I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s was going to be as cute as it really is! I love everything about it!</li>
    <li> nice,good product and quality..reasonable price! i hope they have different color</li>
    <li> I bought these for my dance students for the holidays. They were perfect, larger than you would think. It fits all of the makeup I have! Plus I was able to puff paint all of their names. Quick and easy!</li>
    <li> Shipping- fast, during a reasonable amount of time&lt;br /&gt;Quality- ehh it&#x27;s ok. A portion of my big un stitched. The part near the zipper. I just sewed it pack together with a needle. So it was a hassle having to do this and expecting them to check for great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror isn&#x27;t broken for mine.&lt;br /&gt;It just fits your regular makeup. Travel size makeup bag right here.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a toothbrush bag for school since I have braces.&lt;br /&gt;Got a couple of complamaints for this bag.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I still like it even with the stich mark</li>
    <li> Great big enough for my makeup love it the color the little mirror very satisfied with this great item thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this pink cosmetic bag a few months ago, and it&#x27;s perfect for me. It&#x27;s a little big, but I have a big purse so it&#x27;s fine for me. The mirror sucks, but I didn&#x27;t expect much. I&#x27;m going to buy another one as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for this size of cosmetic bag.  I don&#x27;t store alot of make up in it, but it holds all the basics, and is well made.</li>
    <li> cheap, but actually not bad considering what i paid for it. i thought it would break in a day, but it&#x27;s actually held up pretty well. i would purchase it again. in fact i might actually purchase it again as a small diaper pouch to fit inside my purse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s made in China-which should have been my clue that this bag was a piece of junk. It is. The zipper stopped working as soon as I opened it to fill it. Threw it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I so love my cosmetic bag love it for the fact that it has a mirror on the inside, great bag</li>
    <li> The price for this was perfect as an add on gift for Christmas. What I received was a VERY nicely constructed cosmetic bag worthy of an asking price of at least $20, I spent $3. Will be buying one for myself as well as all of my girlfriends. Beware, it ships from China so it took a little extra time to ship but WELL worth it!</li>
    <li> I love it! I got hot pink! You can fit anything in this bag. But it does take a long time to get to where it&#x27;s going. But it&#x27;s worth it! It&#x27;s nice and roomy and I can fit pencils an pens I love it!</li>
    <li> It was a gift an she loved it</li>
    <li> worked greatr for what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Nice little bag for travel..good for lipstick, moisturizer, etc.. when traveling or at home</li>
    <li> Bought this in pink and black. Thought they were the same bag in different colors but they were different sizes when they arrived. Was going to return the smaller pink one but it ended up being my favorite. Big enough to fit my makeup and small enough to fit in my bag. Really love it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, IS EASY TO USE AND VERY USEFUL. A GREAT GIFT FOR CHRISTMAS, I RECOMMENDED FOR ALL PEOPLE</li>
    <li> Love this purchase!  Needed a not to big, not to small cosmetic/catch all for my purse.  Love the size, color, durability, and price.</li>
    <li> Really cute case. I got it for my daughters pretend make-up play. It looks very durable and should last a while.</li>
    <li> This is really nice and perfect for makeup and other things and it came earlier than it said it would. Im really happy with it(:</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a medium size make-up bag, pretty pink but by far not a bargain by the time you paid S/H it came to about $9, could have gotten it from any Drug Store.</li>
    <li> This pouch keeps all of my cosmetics right at hand and readily available.  It&#x27;s a very nice color as well.</li>
    <li> Love love amazing product for an unbelievable price!!! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I like the pink bag. I use it for my toiletries for my gym bag.  It&#x27;s great it has lot small compartments along with a large compartment. The mirror is great.</li>
    <li> Cheap product, but for the price it is very nice. It does its job and I love the little mirror. I was surprised that the outside of it was so nice, however, the pockets in the inside are very flimsy and look like they could break soon. But again, good product for the price and it came fairly quickly!</li>
    <li> it was just want i was looking for not to big not to small just the rite size to put what i need to put in the mirror is a plus its not creck and its pink and that is why i love it so much it took a little time to come but i&#x27;m happy that i got it thank you so much</li>
    <li> Mirror broke but love my little bag as I keep all of my files and nail clippers. Perfect!</li>
    <li> A bit cheap looking on the inside otherwise very cute and seems durable.</li>
    <li> Very small, and easy to travel with. I like the color that was described as the same of the picture shown. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to come with a little hidden pocket or anything. Works great for me, with the little make up I do wear and even have extra room for other things. The mirror is just a bonus when you need it for something. Not something to take a great deal of space which in my opinion is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I wanted a cosmetic bag for my purse, this fits nicely. The zipper is easy to use and the bag seems well made.</li>
    <li> very cheaply made, the zipper on it kinda detached on the side, the plastic pockets on the inside fell apart, but it is a really good sized makeup bag, only problem is its falling apart. but, you get what you pay for. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Looks just like pic, large zipper works good and fits a lot love it and great price</li>
    <li> Cheap and food make up bag</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. I had it for a few days then it ripped. Cheap product, cheap price.</li>
    <li> just what I was looking for. I got one in blue too and I can say well crafted.</li>
    <li> nice size, nice quality.I like the pouch but I ended up using something else because it took so long to receive it.</li>
