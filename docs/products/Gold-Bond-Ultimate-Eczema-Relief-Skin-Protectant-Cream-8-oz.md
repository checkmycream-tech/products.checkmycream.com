      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two weeks now, and it&#x27;s the best over the counter eczema relief product I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
      <li>quick shipping ,good product</li>
      <li>But the best part is, when I woke up the next morning</li>
      <li>I should have known better as the oatmeal treatment never worked before</li>
      <li>but as one rash started getting better another one would start.</li>
      <li>Skin looks &amp; feels so much better.</li>
      <li>Better than most...</li>
      <li>I have tried many products, this one goes in theTRASH.</li>
      <li>My latest rash was on my ears and even the prescription lotion couldn&#x27;t stop inching</li>
      <li>Looked up top 5 rated eczema creams, ordered No.l and No. 2.  </li>

      <li>I am completely in love with this product.</li>
      <li>Avoid using soaps and use cetaphil cleansers for handwashing, don&#x27;t shower any longer than 10 minutes and make sure the temperature is always lukewarm. :)</li>
      <li>Better than the prescribed salve</li>
      <li>My skin is not 100% better but</li>
      <li>somehow it was better.  </li>
      <li>Give this one a try, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>so I expect to update this review after more time has passed.</li>
      <li>I tried so many things</li>
      <li>I am sooo glad that I did buy it.</li>
      <li>Love, love this product.</li>
      <li>It feels so good on your skin the first time you use it1</li>
      <li>Seems to be working pretty good for me</li>
      <li>Perfect for that itchy dry patch of skin.</li>
      <li>flare-ups soft and moist and can greatly delay or ameliorate a flare-up.</li>
      <li>The healing is pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, so it spreads easily.  </li>
      <li>really love that this cream has no unpleasant scent, and absorbs within seconds.</li>
      <li>And doing that with this product is providing wonderful results for my little guy.  </li>
      <li>Love this cream works great for dry skin!</li>
      <li>and my legs were so smooth and</li>
      <li>The skin is definitely healing and he is so happy he can find some relief from the itch.</li>
      <li>Although these products helped to soothe the itch somewhat, they really weren&#x27;t effective.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally have something that will relieve her of the troubles she&#x27;s had with eczema.</li>
      <li>I read somewhere that for eczema sufferers, it is important to put lotion on</li>
      <li>Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Relief skin protectant cream is good and usually I love this brand over all others.</li>
      <li>I have continued to use this cream on my hands and elbows, and will most definitely purchase more before I run out!</li>
      <li>Works great for reducing redness and dry skin in affected areas.</li>
      <li>If its a true break out we use something stronger.</li>
      <li>but it quickly stopped and my skin became softer.</li>
      <li>quick delivery</li>
      <li>That worries me, but after a few minutes he&#x27;s happy again.</li>
      <li>This, combined with the cool/windy weather, led to my knuckles becoming cracked, and my hands becoming red and itchy.</li>
      <li>Though it does work decently for dry, red patches, it seemed to do more harm than good in the areas where my eczema was most problematic and blistery.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found this product and glad that my wrist is finally back to normal!</li>
      <li>I feel as though it may work more effectively on a new outbreak, but it&#x27;s making a positive difference</li>
      <li>Had eczema since I was a baby--used tar soap and other petroleum products, didn&#x27;t smell good but worked.  </li>
      <li>right after you get out of the shower to lock in moisture.  </li>
      <li>I stumbled upon this product while browsing the shelves at my walmart and bought it right away.</li>
      <li>Sigh, back to using Cortizone 10 with Aloe for now.rk decently for dry, red patches, it seemed to do more harm than good in the areas where my eczema was most problematic and blistery.</li>
      <li>, I highly recommend this lotion for people that suffer with dermatitis or eczema!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s helping others, because eczema is a daily struggle, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
      <li>I have only been using it for 2 days, and my hands are soooo much better.</li>
      <li>This lotion works great for dry red patches on my fingers and hands.</li>
      <li>it from a guy who had pretty much given up and was just waiting for Spring for my condition to naturally heal itself - this stuff is fantastic.</li>
      <li>The lotion is very lotiony, I&#x27;ve seemed to have better luck with ointments that are oily, though only for awhile.</li>
      <li>This makes the skin softer super quickly and because it is especially made for eczema which is helpful.</li>
      <li>I knew it right after the first application that this is effective in moisturizing my baby&#x27;s delicate skin.</li>
      <li>I now put it on my whole body after my shower to help stop future breakouts, and it makes your skin amazingly smooth, and I apply it to my ears a couple times a day.</li>
      <li>I have never had a lotion work that fast.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great for reducing redness and dry skin in affected areas.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two weeks now, and it&#x27;s the best over the counter eczema relief product I&#x27;ve tried so far.  It&#x27;s not a miracle cure--I still have dry, scaly skin if I don&#x27;t keep it moisturized--but it has reduced the peeling and itching considerably.  My skin looks closer to normal than it has in a very long time.  I bought mine at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> I was born with eczema on my legs and arms. I tried so many things but none of them worked as well as this. This makes the skin softer super quickly and because it is especially made for eczema which is helpful.</li>
    <li> Kind of pricey here of amazon. You can find some at your local walmart for $9.97 Nonetheless, I have suffered from severe dermatitis (hand eczema) on my hands. I was always insecure about them, I never wanted someone to look at my hand because it was always peeling, had these bubbles of fluid, and often time really red. After being prescribed with hydrocortisones and all these steroid creams from the dermatologists, I started to give up, nothing was working, plus the ointments were just annoying to work with. I remember hearing an advertisement about gold bond being the best eczema relief lotion on tv, but at that time my hands weren&#x27;t that bad and flaring up. Funny how it started getting worse after that. So, I figured why not, and miraculously, my hands were beginning to heal. Just after a few days I&#x27;ve notice dramatic changes. I would apply it after showers, after washing my hands, when I woke up, and before I slept, or whenever I started noticing any dryness on my hands. Great results from a great product, I highly recommend this lotion for people that suffer with dermatitis or eczema!! Avoid using soaps and use cetaphil cleansers for handwashing, don&#x27;t shower any longer than 10 minutes and make sure the temperature is always lukewarm. :)</li>
    <li> This is truly a gift. I use this as a daily lotion because I find it tones, heals, and firms the skin. I recently discovered  the 14oz pump bottle at walgreens.</li>
    <li> Better than the prescribed salve</li>
    <li> Love, love this product. My 5 month old baby has very dry skin on her cheeks and arms. I have tried aveeno and aquaphor without much help. I&#x27;m getting desperate because my baby can&#x27;t stop scratching her face. I stumbled upon this product while browsing the shelves at my walmart and bought it right away. I knew it right after the first application that this is effective in moisturizing my baby&#x27;s delicate skin. I&#x27;m so happy I found a product that works!</li>
    <li> tried this stuff and it didnt work, just irritated my skin even more. Went back to my other lotion vaseline with aloe.</li>
    <li> I have horrible eczema on my hands &amp; I am on a constant search for something that will calm, the redness, scaling, peeling, cracking &amp; itchiness. After reading the reviews for this product, I jumped at the chance to try it. At first my hands felt better, but then they got worse then ever. Instead of calming my hands, they became more inflamed &amp; painful. It upset me, because I wanted this product to work so badly. I ended up going back to my old stand by, &amp;#34;Aquaphor&amp;#34; which instantly soothed my skin. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s helping others, because eczema is a daily struggle, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
    <li> it works better then most, but still not perfect, but will order again when I need it...Better than most...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wally Crane</li>
    <li> Seems to be working pretty good for me</li>
    <li> My two year old son has had eczema since he was just a few months old... we&#x27;ve tried every lotion possible; we&#x27;ve gone to doctors, allergists, dermatologists and next month we&#x27;ll see a nautropath.  I saw a commercial for this and was 100% skeptical, but I&#x27;m a mother desperate for relief for my son so I bought it yesterday.  After two applications over a 24 hour period, his skin was soft to the touch (minus his healing scratches) and the redness was GONE.  I&#x27;m in disbelief!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars, is because my son cries when I put it on which he doesn&#x27;t do with other creams or lotions.  That worries me, but after a few minutes he&#x27;s happy again.</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this at Wal Mart (much cheaper) to try on my boyfriend&#x27;s eczema. There was no overnight shocker, but on first application he said it was very soothing and that it definitely relieved the itch. The next morning, the smaller eczema patches were smooth, not rough, and the skin was softer to touch. He&#x27;s been using it twice a day (after showers, and using the Cetaphil eczema wash, which he says does nothing at all and smells like plastic) for about a week now and the wide swaths of irritated skin look considerably less &amp;#34;angry red&amp;#34; now. The skin is definitely healing and he is so happy he can find some relief from the itch. I feel as though it may work more effectively on a new outbreak, but it&#x27;s making a positive difference and so we&#x27;re sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a product that has totally relieved me of dryness, scaling, and redness. Thank you Gold Bond! #Hi5</li>
    <li> Perfect for that itchy dry patch of skin. Rubbing on Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Relief gets rid of the itch instantly. I have also used it on the itchy mosquito bites and it takes the itchy out. The healing is pretty amazing. Rough elbow, it took 3 days for my rough elbow from leaning on my office chair on and off all day, to heal and become smooth again. Long lasting! It doesn&#x27;t take much so the tube will last a long time too!</li>
    <li> Both of my children have eczema, and the product that really worked for my son didn&#x27;t do anything for my daughter&#x27;s eczema. I had found a product that worked okay, but not great. And then Gold Bond gave us this wonderful lotion! After one application, her eczema was almost gone. She still gets outbreaks occasionally, but they aren&#x27;t as bad as the ones she was having before. She hasn&#x27;t told me &amp;#34;ouchie&amp;#34; since we switched to this cream.</li>
    <li> all the praise is authentic and accurate, I couldn&#x27;t find at my Walmart,so if u have severe excema,buy two tubes, barely through first,no more itching ,thank goodness,no scaling,close to healing,a bit slower than rx prescription,but that was a vicious cycle, its daily use but if u have severe excema,u&#x27;ll need to apply 2-3x a day,generous amount of lotion, like all of us,its been so long since I developed this problem without relief or actual healing, I cant praise it enough and I know my comment wasn&#x27;t entirely necessary for ppl to make a judgment call given other comments but If something is a good or great product,i have the need to post, Im just grateful for the comments before me, that peaked my interest, it truly is a godsend not to use word lightly, No More Itching, and Hence Healing</li>
    <li> Many different lotion products serve as lubricants that help to minimize the negative effects of eczema once they are present, but are unable to either prevent flare-ups or resist the worsening of flare-ups after they occur.  This product is one of three that go beyond lubrication to delay and minimize flare-ups.</li>
    <li> Walmart does have this much cheaper - $9.97. This stuff is INCREDIBLE. I have been suffering from severe eczema on my hands for almost 9 months now. I have tried countless creams, soaps, and treatments. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this, because I didn&#x27;t want to spend money on something else that didn&#x27;t help me. I am sooo glad that I did buy it. I have only been using it for 2 days, and my hands are soooo much better. Way less red, no more scaling, no itchiness..and they are finally healing. I put a little bit on every time they start to feel dry, and after each time I wash my hands, and before bed. It is a miracle product for me. If you have tried many other \\&quot;eczema treatments\\&quot; without results, please give this a shot!!</li>
    <li> My daughter, age 10, has always had trouble with eczema.  And she&#x27;s always hated any type of treatment we&#x27;ve used as it has usually been greasy and makes any clothing stick to her.  Her legs have been especially bad over the past few weeks, so we decided to try this.  She used the lotion at bedtime and by morning there was already a noticeable improvement!  The best part is now she actually is willing to put this on her skin every day with no complaints.  I&#x27;m so happy to finally have something that will relieve her of the troubles she&#x27;s had with eczema.</li>
    <li> Great stuff!  We use this for our toddler that has horrible eczema.  We have tried just about everything.  It is very hard to find lotion without steroids.  Even Aveeno Eczema Care has steroids in it.  Prolonged use of steroids can be dangerous.  This lotion retails for around $10 in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from Eczema for the longest, and I&#x27;ve been use this and it does work. You have to use it daily and you will see improvements.</li>
    <li> Product is good, but vendor is way over priced.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I am the 1 out of 10 who did not find relief from the product.  It helped my skin a little with the itch, but it did not remove the rash redness.  I even tried wearing gloves at night. I have had chronic Eczema since I was 8 years old and only steroids have helped.  I purchased this with the hope that it would cut down on doctor visits as the co-pays with my cancers and brain injury make my Eczema script copays something that I hoped I could use to cut out that doctor visit and the expensive treatment.  I should have known better as the oatmeal treatment never worked before and I just had hope somehow it was better.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this item for yourself as you are not me and my medicines for my other conditions could have had an influence on this products effectiveness.</li>
    <li> great stuff thank you</li>
    <li> I get eczema on the backs of my hands any year we get really cold winters.  This year was especially bad.  I tried the Aveeno stuff which kept it from getting worse but didn&#x27;t heal it.  Same thing with Bag Balm but with BB I had to wear gloves to bed at night because it&#x27;s so greasy and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an ad for the Gold Bond last week and decided to pick some up.  At the worst I&#x27;d be out 9 bucks on something else that didn&#x27;t work, so I tried it with limited expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs cleanly with no greasy residue (Aveeno leaves a definite coating that rubs off on anything I touch). Within two days I noticed a big difference and after a week of use, my hands are totally healed.  It&#x27;s such a relief to find something that actually works and is very easy to live with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take it from a guy who had pretty much given up and was just waiting for Spring for my condition to naturally heal itself - this stuff is fantastic.</li>
    <li> Wal-mart has the same item for $9.97.  Plus you do not have to pay shipping.  Gold Bond so it has to be good, there is just no need to overpay.</li>
    <li> I saw a commercial for this and thought I would give it a shot. I had been in and out of the doctor&#x27;s office because of my eczema. I was given a prescription lotion but as one rash started getting better another one would start. My latest rash was on my ears and even the prescription lotion couldn&#x27;t stop inching and I couldn&#x27;t even sleep. I applied a layer of gold bond to my ears and the inching just stopped. I have never had a lotion work that fast. I am completely in love with this product. Since it is not a steroid you don&#x27;t have to worry about thinning your skin. I now put it on my whole body after my shower to help stop future breakouts, and it makes your skin amazingly smooth, and I apply it to my ears a couple times a day. I definitely recommend this product and will never try another lotion again</li>
    <li> This works very well on my 5 year old daughters eczema. She has it very bad all over, and it keeps it under control. If its a true break out we use something stronger. But, this cream keeps it from breaking out when applied once to twice everyday. For the price at Walmart with coupon I pay $7.99. So its very good for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this for the eczrma on the hands and arms of my little granddaughter and it seems to be helping.</li>
    <li> Better than a prescription!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream.  It&#x27;s light, so it spreads easily.  Finally, no itching!</li>
    <li> I had a bad rash on my wrist and had been seeing my dermatologist for it for over a year. I tried all kinds of different prescription creams and pills and NOTHING worked. Finally I got so frustrated with the ugly rash, and constant itch, that I decided to look for alternative treatments. I read the reviews on this and decided to give a try and it WORKED! Within 24 hours I could see a small improvement and within 4 days my rash was completely gone. I am shocked. It is truly nothing short of a miracle. I have very sensitive skin and the oatmeal, and no scent formula really works well. I am so glad I found this product and glad that my wrist is finally back to normal!</li>
    <li> Best stuff we&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine from Amazon, BUT it doesn&#x27;t matter...THIS STUFF IS ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!.  It stops ALL itching.  I got mosquito bites and this cream stopped the itch.  I was shocked!!!..Now for the first time in my life, I have a patch of red, scaly, dry, itchy skin one elbow..tahdah...it&#x27;s eczema :(...Can I tell you this stuff stopped the itch, the burn/pain and smoothed out the rough scaly skin significantly.  So, now I am about to buy a case of this stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried this for a flare up of my atopic dermatitis. Having no experience with Gold Bond products before, I picked it up because of the 2% colloidal oatmeal ingredient which is more than what other &amp;#34;fancier&amp;#34; brands have. So I slapped on layers of it on my skin, hoped for the best and went to bed. My skin was still a bit tingling but the cream helped enough to lessen it to the point that I wasn&#x27;t desperately scratching and can actually get some sleep. But the best part is, when I woke up the next morning all the itchiness was gone. Just gone, and hasn&#x27;t returned since. And the only thing I did different this time around was using this cream. I have tried dozens of creams and lotions over the years, and hydrocortisone formulas barely work for me, but this lotion did. Give this one a try, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  It truly is working.  I read somewhere that for eczema sufferers, it is important to put lotion on right after you get out of the shower to lock in moisture.  And doing that with this product is providing wonderful results for my little guy.  I will always keep a tube in my house.</li>
    <li> Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Relief skin protectant cream is good and usually I love this brand over all others. However, this time, I found the cream to feel &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; than Aveeno Baby Eczema Therapy and not as soothing.</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL FOR MY SKIN CONDITION</li>
    <li> I used steroid cream prescribed by my dermatologist for three  years and only received minimal relief. I was using so much he was prescribing 1 pound containers. I also had the side effect of my skin getting very thin. I started using Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema lotion and my skin stated clearing within a week. After five months I only have a minor problem where my hands contact soap. My skin has not been this clear in 60 years and it no longer tears at the slightest bump.</li>
    <li> An excellent non-greasy cream that keeps the area prone to eczema flare-ups soft and moist and can greatly delay or ameliorate a flare-up.</li>
    <li> did not work, waste of money, was not satisfied, better results with common drug store brand, buyer beware of this one,</li>
    <li> I bought this from target but it is too good to pass up writing a review. I have been suffering from SEVERE eczema on my body for over 4 years and tried everything from steroid creams, vitamins, oils, even compound drug creams. Nothing worked and after the most painful flare up I decided to use this cream not expecting any results. I just wanted to relieve the dryness and it exceeded all of my expectations. After applying the cream a few times a day, it reduced the redness and stopped the itching.  I had scaling for a couple of days but it quickly stopped and my skin became softer. I will use this cream for my entire body and I recommend it for anyone who suffers from eczema. It has changed my life!</li>
    <li> love getting things for a good price without leaving the house. quick delivery</li>
    <li> Skin looks &amp; feels so much better.</li>
    <li> very nice. i have improved my eczema problem 90%</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema on her hands and arms and this creams has healed her skin, it is the 2% that made the difference from the 1% creams we tried (Eucerin) or from Avene and La Roche Posay.</li>
    <li> This stuff really is great! I have tried a few things (vitamin B lotion, vaseline, those acidic treatments etc...) and this stuff is the best by far! Very rich and soothing, my skin looked better immediately and the itching/scaliness/redness improved greatly. I highly recommend that others suffering from eczema try this! It feels so good on your skin the first time you use it1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about 5 days now so I expect to update this review after more time has passed. So far it seems to only work on the spots that are new flare ups. I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema since infancy, I&#x27;m now 29. I can go years without a flare up, but I&#x27;ve now had spots of eczema on my body pretty consistently for the last 5 years. Cortisone shots don&#x27;t work anymore and I&#x27;ve tried every cream over the counter and every flax seed oil and oatmeal remedy around. People who suffer from eczema know that scratching can be orgasmic, I&#x27;ve scratched until I&#x27;ve bled. I&#x27;ve learned to live with it, though it makes life less enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eczema can be different for different people, and different on other parts of ones body. This lotion works great for dry red patches on my fingers and hands. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work well on spots on my shoulders and back that blister and weep (not yet anyway). The lotion is very lotiony, I&#x27;ve seemed to have better luck with ointments that are oily, though only for awhile. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product in hopes that it&#x27;ll actually work on the really bad spots overtime. For the price you get a really good amount of lotion so that&#x27;s great. I&#x27;d recommend this mostly to people with moderate eczema, or those who only have dry, red and flaky eczema patches. For really bad patches that blister and weep, I&#x27;ve not noticed it helping much, yet. For those dry, red flaky patches Gold Bond Eczema Relief does seem to offer almost instant relief when applied, though you will have to apply the lotion a few times a day as I&#x27;ve noticed after about 6 hours or so my itchiness comes back. That may not be the case for everyone though, as eczema does effect people differently. This comes Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE 4/3*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stopped using this, I think it actually made the patches of eczema on my shoulder worse. Almost as if the lotion clogged up pores and lead to my eczema blistering badly in those areas. Though it does work decently for dry, red patches, it seemed to do more harm than good in the areas where my eczema was most problematic and blistery. Sigh, back to using Cortizone 10 with Aloe for now.rk decently for dry, red patches, it seemed to do more harm than good in the areas where my eczema was most problematic and blistery.

    <li> Wonderful stuff! When will we be able to get it in the UK please??!</li>
    <li> I have exema and after using this my palms itched till I bled. I have tried many products, this one goes in theTRASH.</li>
    <li> After using the product for just a few days I was surprised at how effective it was working.  The product description was dead on in my book!</li>
    <li> My 9-yr old son patiently puts up with his eczema but a single application of this cream made the latest outbreak on his hands disappear almost immediately. He is delighted and so am I. Actually, we have several other Gold Bond products and they all go on nicely, penetrate fast, and are non-sticky, making them a pleasure to use. This one, however, is particularly remarkable.</li>
    <li> I had eczema for a year. I tried everything from a prescription steroid cream to other brands of eczema cream to A&amp;D ointment and cream. Although these products helped to soothe the itch somewhat, they really weren&#x27;t effective. After 1 day with Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Relief, I saw a noticeable difference. After a week, the rash is just about gone!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! I have psorasis and my hands and feet are really dry. I wasn&#x27;t sure eczema cream would work on psorasis, but it does!! After a few days, my hands and feet aren&#x27;t as dry, cracked, and scaled. It truly is the best!!</li>
    <li> Relief Found !!!!.. This is as about as close to a cure as I have found.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just about everything out there to try escape my misery&lt;br /&gt;and this is the only thing that works. My skin is not 100% better but&lt;br /&gt;90% is close enough. I had been suffering for over 3 years but now&lt;br /&gt;I can sleep again. Thank God for this Gold Bond product.</li>
    <li> I finally found a cream that works for me! I was recently helping to care for a sick relative in the hospital, and had to constantly wash my hands. This, combined with the cool/windy weather, led to my knuckles becoming cracked, and my hands becoming red and itchy. Thankfully, my sister had an extra tube of this cream, and let me try it. Within one day of using it a few times, my hands were healing very well. Within a few days, all signs of my hands being dry/itchy were gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love that this cream has no unpleasant scent, and absorbs within seconds. I have continued to use this cream on my hands and elbows, and will most definitely purchase more before I run out!</li>
    <li> I was suffering from terrible pain on my foot from eczema before I got this cream, it works really well and I think I have tried every other product that is made out there!</li>
    <li> Dosent really work for me. I guess there&#x27;s diff types of eczema</li>
    <li> Gold Bond make really good creams, and I have used them all.  This one worked on my problem scaley heels, and did a good job healing them,,</li>
    <li> Had a hard time actually finding this product, but boy was it worth all the time I spent.  Looked up top 5 rated eczema creams, ordered No.l and No. 2.  So bad, I had to send them back and I spent a lot more money for them than Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Cream.  Had eczema since I was a baby--used tar soap and other petroleum products, didn&#x27;t smell good but worked.  I note your product has petroleum in it as well.  Forget, Cortisone--10+, it only makes things worse, more irritated and causes scaling. Due to high level of stress for the last 6 months have eczema in my scalp, eyebrows, face, all over ears including backs and inside and on my neck and entire chest.  Your product was immediately soothing.  It is gradually fading everywhere that I have it and I have no more itching, scaling and bright red irritation.  I can&#x27;t thank you enough.

    <li> I have very bad exzema on my legs and I&#x27;ve tried numerous creams and none of them have worked. Usually after I shave my legs they look like somebody just chopped them up but as son as I got out of the shower I used the goldbond cream and my legs were so smooth and no signs of redness or dryness so I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Love this cream works great for dry skin!</li>
    <li> This is the best we have ever had. great service too.</li>
    <li> quick shipping ,good product</li>
    <li> First I have to say that I prefer to use all natural skincare products…HOWEVER, I have been battling really dry, scaly, red, itchy patches on my back and upper arms for a little over a year, especially when It&#x27;s hot (hot yoga, hot shower, etc). Anyhow, my son is now 5 months old and the skin issue has only became worse during my pregnancy until now. I finally decided to shop around and buy a product that was made for this issue… I bought the tube yesterday (based on the fact it has more colloidal oatmeal than other brands for the same thing), used it last night after the shower, and again this morning. Tonight when I got out of the shower, I was starting to apply the lotion and looked at my skin and I was shocked! NO RED PATCHES. Zero. Zip! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had to call my husband in to look at my back.. He said that he hasn&#x27;t seen my skin look this good in a loooooong time!! I mean, I don&#x27;t wear tank tops or short sleeves because of the yucky skin.. ever!  Hooray for this product… not only does it work well, it FEELS soooooo soothing and yummy on your skin!!!!! I have never reviewed a product before, but after the results tonight, I had to come straight to my computer and tell the world how great this stuff is! SO GOOD!!!!</li>
    <li> I had slipped and fallen on ice and broken 4 bones in my lower leg and foot. As a result, I had to wear a heavy sock with an orthopedic boot. I would awake in the night with a terrible burning itch in the leg and foot. A moderate application of Gold Bond Ultimate Eczema Relief salved the irritation. Relief was not immediate, but by the time I had the sock and boot back on, the irritation was much relieved. By the time I was back in bed, the burning itch was gone and stayed gone for 4-6 hours. I have almost depleted the first tube and have ordered a second.</li>
