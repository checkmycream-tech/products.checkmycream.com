      <li>VERY excellent for my 4b coily hair.</li>
      <li>This is the best that I&#x27;ve found for moisturizing and maintaining my curl pattern.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s the best product for holding my hair in place and keeping it shinny.</li>
      <li>Smooths the fly away pieces of hair and the edges.</li>
      <li>and this product works great.</li>
      <li>But i have to say that this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>Love It!!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing!</li>
      <li>It also has a pleasant, elusive scent of olive oil.  </li>
      <li>Good for curly hair.  </li>
      <li>It seemed like a good value.  </li>
      <li>And i love it!</li>

      <li>Nice shine to hair</li>
      <li>Nice scent.  </li>
      <li>No flaky residue and nice smell.</li>
      <li>but I found this to be more moisturizing and better hold.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad that I did.</li>
      <li>love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>I love this product, my hair is very different and more manageable more beautiful</li>
      <li>I could see using this to keep things smooth and neat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to relying on a Trader Joe&#x27;s conditioner with many fewer ingredients and added my own olive oil to it.  </li>
      <li>She had mixed curly hair just like me and said she used it the day I seen her and because her curls looked so good</li>
      <li>this product works so much better on my natural hair than it did on my relaxed hair!</li>
      <li>so prominent that this would be a natural product without the synthetic chemicals.  </li>
      <li>Even when I don&#x27;t always use the Pudding after shampooing, my hair is still soft and shiny, so I know it is becoming healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The description says its good for smoothing down hair and holding ponytails.</li>
      <li>and it smoothed the ends much nicer and more complete than w/ Shea Curl Enhancing Smoothie.</li>
      <li>I really like it!</li>
      <li>I am going to let everybody know how well this not expensive product is.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even know if all the ingredients are safe for long term use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have super frizzy natural hair</li>
      <li>I really like this product; it is not sticky nor is it clumpy in my hair.</li>
      <li>I had almost thrown this away because I tried this after my big chop and didnt see anything special about it then but decided to put it away and try it later when my hair was at a different length and stage and I am glad I did.</li>
      <li>I purchased this at Kmart once and the texture was super different and worked as advertised.</li>
      <li>hair winds up soft, silky and with a gentle sheen, with added lift and body.  </li>
      <li>hold on this product is soft but can get gummy if you use too much.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my daughters hair moist and her braids nice and neat for at least a week</li>
      <li>I got right back in the show and washed it out......</li>
      <li>I am all natural with very dry hair I used it to smooth my hair for a pony tail hold and it worked wonders for my hair.</li>
      <li>It was a bit stiff due to the compiling of water and hair drying together, but as soon as I ran my hand through it and broke it up, its became extremely soft and smells very very nice.  </li>
      <li>After using the ORS Hold Pudding my hair felt very soft to the touch</li>
      <li>I bought this product last summer to slick my sides down for a beautiful ponytail, but it did not work.</li>
      <li>After a co-wash I apply a leave in (Direct Leave In) and finger coiled w/</li>
      <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and it holds nothing.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m natural and bought this on recommendation from a friend of mine who is also natural.  </li>
      <li>Nowfor those who are organic conscious.</li>
      <li>I went to a sally&#x27;s near by and a lady working there recommend this product to me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and use this as a styler prior to protective styling.</li>
      <li>I love the custard (thick though)</li>
      <li>However, it looked so cool on the self, so i broke down and brought it away.</li>
      <li>I do this until I have done my whole head, then rub my now almost dry palms through the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very sensitive to perfumes, so this is a big plus for me.  </li>
      <li>it keeps my hair flat and smooth with little to no flakes.</li>
      <li>I have natural hair, I apply a small amount to the end to smooth out when i style my natural curly hair to keep ends from being so dry.</li>
      <li>I am not organic conscious, i juts don&#x27;t like things that cause harm or dryness, such as alcohol or  parabens (this has neither).  </li>
      <li>Most styling products weigh it down and make it look stiff and</li>
      <li>hair is short and fine and I usually towel dry and tousle it a bit, which brings out its little bit natural wave.  </li>

<li> hair is short and fine and I usually towel dry and tousle it a bit, which brings out its little bit natural wave.  </li>
<li> Normally, i just lay my hair down with water and a creamy leave-in conditioner, because i don&#x27;t like the way gel feels in my hair.</li>
<li> Steer clear if you are looking for a product that will hold your hair down, because this will not.</li>
<li> I think we spent about 3 days going to various place and finally ended up at a Walgreens for about 20 minutes looking for something for my needs.</li>
<li> When my hair turned grey, I liked the color but was not happy with its dull lifeless look.  </li>
<li> I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair all three have different textures from thick and coarse to soft and wavy.</li>
<li> Make my hair stay down after a shower using very little product and absolutely zero stiffness.</li>
<li> Even after it drys my hair doesn&#x27;t loose moisture and look dry and frizzy.</li>
<li> or you will have a white sticky mess on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> We were about to give up and leave due to their limited selection, but then my lady found this.</li>
<li> I know this product probably has ingredients that are not really organic</li>
<li> I wet my hair, apply the pudding, and style.  </li>
<li> and she is the type of girl that is rough on her hair</li>
<li> I am now using this product and probably will for quite some time due to the price and results.</li>
<li> The naming is misleading since olive oil is the 15th ingredient after things like glycerin, polyquaternium-11, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, PEG-150 stearate, polysorbate-60, and other impossible-to-parse additives.  </li>
<li> my hair felt so dry and heavy</li>
<li> In other words, don&#x27;t be heavy handed</li>
<li> Holds well without making the hair feel weighed down or stiff</li>
<li> It has 0 hold but it does moisturize a little.</li>
<li> Well I just used about a dime size dab through towel dried hair, combed it for a couple seconds then headed to work while it dries.</li>
<li> Smooth-n-Hold Pudding, I rub a very little bit in my palms, rub my fingertips on my palms, and then rub them into my scalp.  </li>
<li> I also learnt that those heavy protein gel are not good for your hair.</li>
<li> Not sticky, flakey nor hard to comb thru.</li>
<li> After watching a negative review about this product i was a little afraid to try it.</li>
<li> Hate to even say that</li>
<li> Worst product ever for a twist out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I went to a sally&#x27;s near by and a lady working there recommend this product to me. She had mixed curly hair just like me and said she used it the day I seen her and because her curls looked so good I thought I would give it a try........I used it once and will NEVER use it again. ...my hair felt so dry and heavy my curls wouldn&#x27;t even hold and it made my hair so tangled I got right back in the show and washed it out......NEVER AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> After watching a negative review about this product i was a little afraid to try it. However, it looked so cool on the self, so i broke down and brought it away. And i love it! Normally, i just lay my hair down with water and a creamy leave-in conditioner, because i don&#x27;t like the way gel feels in my hair. I also learnt that those heavy protein gel are not good for your hair. But i have to say that this stuff is great. After using the ORS Hold Pudding my hair felt very soft to the touch but yet still combable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair just out of curiosity what I will look like with longer male hair. My girlfriend is a hair stylist and we had the solve a problem I created. Make my hair stay down after a shower using very little product and absolutely zero stiffness. I think we spent about 3 days going to various place and finally ended up at a Walgreens for about 20 minutes looking for something for my needs. We were about to give up and leave due to their limited selection, but then my lady found this. We looked at it for a minutes, saw it was about $5 for an entire container and decided just to give it a try. I never was fond of using product without a designer label but thats just because I&#x27;m a designer myself and am used to buying these fancy bottles.  Well I just used about a dime size dab through towel dried hair, combed it for a couple seconds then headed to work while it dries. It was a bit stiff due to the compiling of water and hair drying together, but as soon as I ran my hand through it and broke it up, its became extremely soft and smells very very nice.  Take it from a guys perspective. I am now using this product and probably will for quite some time due to the price and results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the prominence of Olive Oil in the name and the quantity for the price.  It seemed like a good value.  I don&#x27;t think so now that I&#x27;ve received it.  The naming is misleading since olive oil is the 15th ingredient after things like glycerin, polyquaternium-11, cetearyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, PEG-150 stearate, polysorbate-60, and other impossible-to-parse additives.  Even aloe is listed before the olive oil.  Does aloe not attract enough buyers to feature it on the label?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I thought with \\&quot;organic\\&quot; so prominent that this would be a natural product without the synthetic chemicals.  That&#x27;s not the case (see above), and I don&#x27;t even know if all the ingredients are safe for long term use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s performance in terms of hold and shine is so-so.  I&#x27;ve gone back to relying on a Trader Joe&#x27;s conditioner with many fewer ingredients and added my own olive oil to it.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product and consider the description deceptive.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;m natural and bought this on recommendation from a friend of mine who is also natural.  This is the best that I&#x27;ve found for moisturizing and maintaining my curl pattern.  I wet my hair, apply the pudding, and style.  Even after it drys my hair doesn&#x27;t loose moisture and look dry and frizzy.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the BUSINESS! I Love it! It assist with ponytail styles or molding styles also use some on your edges...GREAT PRODUCT...</li>
    <li> Decided to revisit this product since I used to use it years ago when my hair was relaxed...this product works so much better on my natural hair than it did on my relaxed hair! It&#x27;s very moisturizing and use this as a styler prior to protective styling. I really like it!</li>
    <li> It keeps my daughters hair moist and her braids nice and neat for at least a week and she is the type of girl that is rough on her hair so I can say it makes my life easier!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last summer to slick my sides down for a beautiful ponytail, but it did not work. It made my hair curl up and feel wet, so I dont recommend this product at all for someone with a type 2/3 all natural afro american hair. Steer clear if you are looking for a product that will hold your hair down, because this will not. Well not for me that is for sure! Maybe someone can recommend something else that is not a gel or maybe I should have tried a different technique with it.</li>
    <li> Works well.  Nice shine to hair</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this! ... Nowfor those who are organic conscious. on everything, this does contain mineral oil , which is not organic.  I am not organic conscious, i juts don&#x27;t like things that cause harm or dryness, such as alcohol or  parabens (this has neither).  I love the custard (thick though) consistency, effect on wet/damp/dry styling.  great twist out results for me!</li>
    <li> Does not work for either of us. I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and it holds nothing. I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair all three have different textures from thick and coarse to soft and wavy. I purchased this at Kmart once and the texture was super different and worked as advertised. This one I purchased from here felt a lot thinner and water based. Wind be buying again. The 2 stars are for the speedy arrival.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a product for my hair, maybe for others.  Did not like the texture or feel it gave to my hair and left the hair feeling flaky</li>
    <li> I really like this product; it is not sticky nor is it clumpy in my hair. I have natural hair, I apply a small amount to the end to smooth out when i style my natural curly hair to keep ends from being so dry.</li>
    <li> It is a white gel in a tub.  Do not let your eyes fool you. This is not a whipped styling creme.  Its a gel and should be used as such.  In other words, don&#x27;t be heavy handed or you will have a white sticky mess on your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold on this product is soft but can get gummy if you use too much.  I&#x27;ve been using it in my wash n go but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that. (It leaves it a bit frizzy.)  The description says its good for smoothing down hair and holding ponytails. If you wear updos, ponytails, french twists, etc.  I could see using this to keep things smooth and neat.</li>
    <li> Good for curly hair.  Nice scent.  Holds well without making the hair feel weighed down or stiff</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I saw it on the shelf at Wal-Mart and decided to give it a try and I am so glad that I did. I am all natural with very dry hair I used it to smooth my hair for a pony tail hold and it worked wonders for my hair. Not sticky, flakey nor hard to comb thru. I am going to let everybody know how well this not expensive product is.</li>
    <li> I know this product probably has ingredients that are not really organic but it&#x27;s the best product for holding my hair in place and keeping it shinny. I have super frizzy natural hair and this product works great. No flaky residue and nice smell.</li>
    <li> Smooths the fly away pieces of hair and the edges. Makes my hair feel so soft. I like this product.</li>
    <li> VERY excellent for my 4b coily hair. After a co-wash I apply a leave in (Direct Leave In) and finger coiled w/ this product and it smoothed the ends much nicer and more complete than w/ Shea Curl Enhancing Smoothie. Hate to even say that but I found this to be more moisturizing and better hold. I had almost thrown this away because I tried this after my big chop and didnt see anything special about it then but decided to put it away and try it later when my hair was at a different length and stage and I am glad I did. Love It!!</li>
    <li> When my hair turned grey, I liked the color but was not happy with its dull lifeless look.  I tried several different shampoos, conditioners and styling products.  No improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short and fine and I usually towel dry and tousle it a bit, which brings out its little bit natural wave.  Most styling products weigh it down and make it look stiff and artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Smooth-n-Hold Pudding, I rub a very little bit in my palms, rub my fingertips on my palms, and then rub them into my scalp.  I do this until I have done my whole head, then rub my now almost dry palms through the rest of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair winds up soft, silky and with a gentle sheen, with added lift and body.  It also has a pleasant, elusive scent of olive oil.  I am very sensitive to perfumes, so this is a big plus for me.  My formerly itchy scalp is now not a problem.  Even when I don&#x27;t always use the Pudding after shampooing, my hair is still soft and shiny, so I know it is becoming healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product an A+++.</li>
    <li> I bought it from a local store. Worst product ever for a twist out. My twist out didn&#x27;t last a day. It has 0 hold but it does moisturize a little. On a scaled from 1 to 10 it&#x27;s like a 3.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product, my hair is very different and more manageable more beautiful</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received it in 2 days!!! This product works wonders on my hair it keeps my hair flat and smooth with little to no flakes. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
