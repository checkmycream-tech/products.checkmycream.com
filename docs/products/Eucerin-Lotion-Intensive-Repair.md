<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Eucerin Lotion works very well on extra dry skin. We have used it foe many years and have been fully satisfied.</li>
    <li> great for &amp;#34;winter skin&amp;#34; highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Completely changed dry skin on my feet and arms.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin you need this product</li>
    <li> this is great lotion. not too oily or anything. great for dry sensitive skin. kinda pricey but for me well worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Very good for dry legs and elbows.  I&#x27;ve been buying this for years.</li>
    <li> Great price for this dermatologist-recommended product. Keep skin moist and treat skin problems like eczema.  One-handed use with this well-designed squirt top.</li>
    <li> i use this religiously on both my kids, twice a day, to stave off eczema and dry skin.  i mix it with [[ASIN:B001FB5IP0 Aquaphor Healing Ointment  Advanced Therapy, 14-Ounce Jars (Pack of 2)]]to get some extra moisturizing and to help create a barrier for irritants and allergens.  bad breakouts still require prescription creams, but if i stick to this lotion regimen (and baths), then i find i can prevent breakouts altogether (almost all of the time).  i have also found it gentle enough to use on their faces, even as babies.  but note that the alpha hydroxy acids may make skin more sensitive to the sun, and it seems to make my kids&#x27; skin more sensitive to extreme cold and wind as well (an extra layer of aquaphor before going out seems to help).</li>
    <li> I have used so many creams and lotions I can&#x27;t remember how many.  None of them worked until my Dr. recommended Eucerin.  Works like a charm.  No more flakes or hard spots on my feet.  I am thoroughly satisfied.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this this lotion!...I read a few reviews before buying and was a bit skeptical because I have tried almost every lotion out there i.e- Cetaphil, aquaphore, cocoa butter, aveeno, gold bond...to name a few but nothing worked..went ahead with the purchase &amp; I am very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;My younger bro and I suffer from eczema and his skin is a lot more dry/rougher than mine....&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin moisturizes/soothes/repairs dry skin...we have been using it for about 2months and haven&#x27;t seen a dry patch since, I even got my best friend to try it (he just has really bad dry skin) and he has been raving about it...anyway if you are considering using this then dont think twice, it really works...I see some people say its greasy, I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it that...I have used some really greasy lotions that make me sweat and really oily, this lotion does not do that. portion control is what I would suggest, apply a generous amount if you have really dry skin and smaller amounts if skin is not so dry...Ok i&#x27;m rambling but REALLY great product :)</li>
    <li> I tried to use this in larger quantities for an exfoliating routine. I put an excessive amount on, wait about 10-20 min and exfoliate using exfoliating gloves. I do this for my feet and hands sometimes and this winter being especially harsh decided it was time. It didn&#x27;t do much. It didn&#x27;t even penetrate my heels enough to help slough away any dead skin. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s better in small doses as a hand cream or body cream but if you want something heavy duty in heavy doses for exfoliating rituals you may want to look elsewhere. Too much will just makes you feel dirty, sticky and look and feel greasy. I am trying Olay body quench for this routine in hopes I have better luck. Just waiting for that to ship. If anyone has any ideas please email me or something. Would appreciate it. :) Thank you!  sept5th2009@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> My baby suffers from horrible all over boy eczema, this is the first lotion that has done anything to help him, his skin actually feels smooth even though he gets occasional flare ups still . This is the only lotion we use in our house now because it makes such a huge difference for him, and during the winter it works miracles on the rest of the family. I also love the hand cream from Eucerin.    FYI: I purchased this 2 pack plus bonus hand cream for about 16 dollars from my local wholesale club, I also had a coupon so it brought the cost down to about 10 dollars. Excellent price.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s the best selling lotion, I don&#x27;t quite like this product. After applying it to my skin, it feels skicky...</li>
    <li> really good for really dried skin that sometimes results in small bumps/keratosis pilaris.   really makes everything smooth if you use it daily. was happy to find this deal in the double pack</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me by friends who have dealt with childhood excema and I now use it on all my kids after baths.  It leaves their skin moisturized, but not overly greasy and their skin is soft and supple by the next morning (we bathe and use it mostly at night).  I would highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with excema or dry skin or just wanting a great overall refreshing feel.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. It really hydrates your skin and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and leaves your skin silky soft.</li>
    <li> Realmente, ordene esta locion porq me parecio razonable el precio en compracion con el tamaño... Siempre uso este tipo de lociones para el cuerpo porq hidratan y dan buen aspecto y mantenimiento a la piel...  Lo recibi en Venezuela a los 15 dias luego de ordenar en excelentes condiciones, tal como lo ofertaron.   Los puedo recomendar ampliamente....</li>
    <li> Very effective on extremely dry/cracked skin. Works the best when applying immediately after shower (don&#x27;t wait until your skin is completely dry--that&#x27;ll make you feel the lotion is too greasy).</li>
    <li> Many reviewers say this cream is great for eczema, which may be true, but if you have simple, regular, everyday dry skin then I would skip this cream.    It is greasy, very greasy.  After using it on my body I have to wash my hands two or three times to get it off so that I could go about my morning without smearing everything with grease.  Plus it takes FOREVER for it to absorb into the skin.    Overall I will certainly never buy this again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is good for skin that is really flaky or scaly like psoriasis but if you have no skin disease then this lotion is way too greasy and it does not absorb really fast like Lubriderm and Curel lotion. If you do not care about greasiness then this lotion do the job.</li>
    <li> Take care of your feet. (Good for those with type-2.)</li>
    <li> It was good price, and i was not finding it in my local stores... definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the reviews cause this stuff is a real greasy mess, the extra enriched hand cream is the best, I thought it would be the same product NOT!!!!!</li>
    <li> Eucerin cream is simply awesome. That was the only cream that provided relief to my son&#x27;s rashes. But this is available much cheaper outside locally. You might want to check before you purhcase. It is generally around $9.00.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright lotion. One of the more oily types. I have keratosis pelaris and was recommended this since it had urea and lactic acid in it (helps with KP), but I really don&#x27;t see any difference with this stuff. It&#x27;s done decently otherwise. I probably am going to switch lotions after this bottle empties up, but it&#x27;s not really a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; lotion, just not for me.</li>
    <li> As other reviewers have said, this product does what it claims. It leaves no bothersome stickiness or greasiness after you rub it in for a minute or do. it absorbs quickly and brings immediate relief, as well as long lasting healing. My hands were recently BADLY chapped and dry but have now completely healed and are incredibly smooth after only a couple of days of using this product. Highly recommended. Hey, I wish it were cheaper, but you can&#x27;t complain about something that works this well. I think because of that, it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for 4 or 5 years since my doctor recommended it. I have extremely dry skin on my lower legs and feet. I apply this lotion once a day before bedtime, and there&#x27;s no dry flakey skin since.</li>
    <li> I normally have pretty oily skin, but a long stay in the hospital resulted in a few dry spots. This eliminated them quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> Best overall lotion I&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but the fact that this lotion claims to be \\&quot;Non-greasy, fast absorbing\\&quot; right on the back of the bottle is pretty funny. I use this lotion on my arms and legs immediately after I shower, and my skin is so greasy for so long that all the hair I shed when I blow dry *30 minutes later* sticks to me. Yep, pretty gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the lotion does its job pretty darn well. I have mild eczema, sensitive dry skin, and a condition where my skin gets itchy under mental stress, but this lotion makes all of that disappear with only one application a day. However, if you can find [[ASIN:B001FB5IN2 Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Calming Creme, 14 Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]], get it instead. It does everything Intensive Repair does, without the greasy mess.</li>
    <li> For dry skin, I have tried all types of cremes.  This works the best.</li>
    <li> Used thru 2 pregnancies. Absorbs quickly and leaves skin moisturized. Love it year round. No odor or residue left behind.</li>
    <li> Not that impressed!  This lotion left a nasty residue on my skin. It didn&#x27;t absorb completely like Curel or Aveeno. I threw it away and I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had purchased the Eucerin cream for my feet.  But it&#x27;s only good for feet at night.  It&#x27;s way too greasy for your whole body.</li>
    <li> For my needs, dry skin, this lotion relieves that itching and that uncomfortable feel of dry skin almost all day long.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and I continue to return to this product.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin, to the point where my knuckles are cracked open.  I tried aveeno intense relief hand cream and that was nice, but i wanted to try something else. So i rubbed it on my hands and they started burning! they left a soft feeling but my hands were aching.  I tried a spot test on my leg (which i had shaved, but much earlier in the day) and that burned too! not for as long though. I&#x27;m not sure if it was my body rejecting the stuff (i&#x27;m also allergic to corn) or if i got a bad batch, because that lotion hurt!</li>
    <li> Super fast shipper.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I previously spent $55 on Kiehls and felt that it wasn&#x27;t really handling my dry skin that well.  So I bought this $8 bottle of eucerin intensive repair.  Certainly does a better job of getting my skin smooth and moisturizer.  However, it feels really greasy.  One of the ingredients is castor oil.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. It&#x27;s a little greasy at first, but works well. My only complaint is the packaging. Both bottles were leaking through the layers of protective packaging. What a mess!</li>
    <li> after two weeks of using this product exclusively, my skin is (very) greasy for 5 hours after applying. my other complaint is that the lotion is not very hydrating. my legs feel as if i don&#x27;t use any moisturizer at all!  at least not as hydrating as my last (and favorite) lotion, jergens ultra healing. i wouldn&#x27;t have switched but i have keratosis pilaris (KP)and it was bothering me to run my hands over my arms/upper legs.  Eucerin Intensive Repair has defiantly improved my KP. not 100% gone but pretty close. despite my two big complains it&#x27;s worth using to treat KP.</li>
    <li> Stays on all day to keep my skin moist and healthy looking. It is a bit sticky so I brush a little bit of baby powder over the lotion and I am ready to go all day.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my KP skin condition, still using it. Not sure of the overall results yet. Initial results look favourable but it&#x27;s still too early to tell.</li>
    <li> If I go without this lotion my skin becomes dry, scaly and flaky especially during the winter months.  I even put a bit on my face.  It works wonders on my cheeks.  I recommend this to anyone with dry, flaky skin.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT ON RECOMENDATION BY MY DOCTOR. THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD FOR DRY SKIN. THE BEST PRICE THAT I HAVE FOUND IT WAS AT B J&#x27;S. MY STORE CLOSED ABOUT TWO YEARS.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion by far.  I&#x27;ve tried many others, and with my skin being as dry as it is (and having eczema), this is the only lotion that really works for me.  Some people find it too greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It&#x27;s not a &#x27;light&#x27; lotion.</li>
    <li> I get very dry skin on my hands during the winter and working in healthcare, it is worse washing my hands multiple times per day...Eucerin lotion is the best product I have found for this problem and the price on Amazon is comparable to what I saw at Sam&#x27;s Club (without the sales tax and with free shipping from Amazon)...will probably order again in a number of months when I need more.</li>
    <li> WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have tried every lotion on the market, and until I tried this....I was never quite satisfied.  This lotion REALLY keeps the skin hydrated...especially in my problem areas (elbows, feet, heels)..and it also works WONDERFULLY on my face. No more ultra expensive face lotion for me. This is it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage everyone to try this lotion who has VERY dry skin, and even if you don&#x27;t have dry skin at all, this lotion is EXCELLENT!!!!!! Why not use the best, right??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also absorbs wonderfully and does NOT leave a gritty or greasy residue feeling afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOP NOTCH product!!!!!!!!! Thanks Eucerin!</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry skin.  Purchase several times.</li>
    <li> I have really dry skin. I have tried many different lotions and creams. This one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> My husband is diabetic. I ask a medical staff member often what is the best lotion a diabetic patient can use. They have always recommended this product.</li>
    <li> The best non-prescription moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. I moisturizer lymphedema extremity before wrapping. And it lasts until my next wrap. Great product.</li>
    <li> and with the pump there is very little waste as you get the amount you need. I will be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products to use for skin care. My kid&#x27;s skin is much better after using this.</li>
    <li> not greasy &amp; does every thing manufacturer says it would. I settled for this lotion after 2days of web research</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl that if asked what beauty product I&#x27;d never leave the house without, my answer wouldn&#x27;t be mascara or lipstick. It would be moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I stuck with my trusty Nivea. I like moisturizers that are white and odorless. I just feel like they&#x27;re cleaner. I liked Nivea because it was light but not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed a mild case of eczema 2 years ago and couldn&#x27;t continue using the Nivea and my doctor recommended that I use only Eucerin. I never went back to anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a thick cream, but with absolutely no stickiness or tackiness that some moisturizers have. It&#x27;s got a pump, which is much more sanitary than a pot you&#x27;re constantly sticking your fingers into. And 1 bottle is pretty big and lasts quite a while. I was so glad to find this deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and was packaged very well. Good job, seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, excellent product,</li>
    <li> I like Eucerin  because it is the highest hydrating lotion I can find. My skin is quite dry and this product works the best for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I had used the regular Eucerin moisturizer for a long time and decided to give this Intensive Repair a try for when winter rolled around. Let me tell you, this stuff leaves your hands feeling extremely greasy/oily. I quickly went back to the normal Eucerin variety. I guess some people like the greasy feeling but it&#x27;s definitely not for me.</li>
    <li> If you have very dry skin, this is a great lotion. It keeps my skin moisturized for many hours. It does feel a little heavy initially when you place it and some people may not like that feel, but if you need long-lasting moisture, it works well.</li>
    <li> As a sufferer of eczema I used Eucerin as a child and always remembered it being very soothing. The problem is I also remembered it being very greasy and heavy. My Mom or Dad always had to help me apply it on my arms. A few years ago when our house went chemical free, Eucerin was no longer an option, but honestly I wasn&#x27;t really that sad. This past year, however, I started having severe hand eczema and I caved and purchased [[ASIN:B001699TI8 Eucerin Intensive Repair Extra-Enriched Hand Creme, 2.7 Ounce Tube]]. My hands went from bleeding to amazing in just two days. I decided to give the Eucerin lotion a try as well because my skin has been miserable. After the first application my arms broke out in a horrible itchy rash. With my skin allergies I know better and usually try new products on a small area first, but I figured Eucerin was safe. I am surprised that I can use the hand lotion successfully, but not the body lotion, but they are vastly different. I guess it&#x27;s back to my old chemical free lotion [[ASIN:B001DJ15KG Dr. Bronner&#x27;s &amp; All-One Organic Lotion for Hands &amp; Body, Lavender Coconut, 8-Ounce Pump Bottle]]</li>
    <li> I love this lotion for my very dry hands. I work outdoors and wash my hand softer so the are very dry.  This is the only lotion I have found that instantly makes my hands feel moisturizer without burning.  The bottle says its a non-greasy lotion but that is not correct.  After using it my hands feel  oily and I do have to wipe my palms with a cloth before I touch my steering wheel, or use the touch pad on my phone.  It works great but the oily feeling afterwards lost them a star.</li>
    <li> First of all, this product reeks. I tried using it by itself and the smell is really disgusting. I ended up using [[ASIN:B001E96M94 Johnson&#x27;s Softlotion 24-Hour Moisturizer, 14-Ounce Pump Bottles (Pack of 4)]] to mask the smell.     I needed something for occasional dry hands and this didn&#x27;t do much for me. It feels strange too. The product is very greasy: you can still see the grease after working it into your skin but it feels dry yet sticky. Its just a terrible feeling (the Johnson&#x27;s softlotion helps with that though).    I gave this two stars become the pump is easy to use and isn&#x27;t too small/narrow. I would recommend [[ASIN:B001FB5IMS Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Intensive Repair Hand Creme Plus, 2.7 Ounces (Pack of 4)]] for dry hands, it is expensive but works well and doesn&#x27;t smell (though I often use Johnson&#x27;s softlotion for a good smell after the eucerin).</li>
    <li> was able to bulk purchase at a reasonable price. Still have on bottle on hand and I&#x27;m going to restock in the fall.</li>
    <li> delivered on time,  excellent product  satisfied with purchase</li>
    <li> This lotion is of very rich and creamy consistency.  It may be a bit too greasy for some folks, but it soaked right into my skin and I recommend using about the size of a dime for most hands and wrists.  I found it well suited for victims of this cold, harsher weather we&#x27;ve had in the Northeast.  It has no scent, so it doesn&#x27;t clash with those of us who wear fragrances like I do.  I am very pleased with the results of this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have been trying products for my extremely dry and always flaking feet.  They have been an embarressment for most of my adult life and I&#x27;m 51.  I read about Eucerin&#x27;s foot product, but it was pricey, and I did not really expect it to work either.  I noticed this version of the same brand and the description was the same, but it was less expensive.  My search for the perfect foot lotion has ended.  This stuff is amazing,  and even though I am going barefoot all the time, my feet look great.  It only took three days...sandals-here I come!  My dry cuticles are gone, too.</li>
    <li> I can do without the initial greasiness of this product but otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product. I have very sensitive skin and can only use certain types of Lotion; this one is great for my skin and definitely takes care of the dryness.</li>
    <li> Loved the Eucerin Lotion and gave one to my daughter for her girls!  The winter time is drying out our skin and the baths we take add to the problem.  Love my lotion!</li>
    <li> Initially, putting this on felt like I was applying lard on my hands. I&#x27;m being a bit facetious of course, but this definitely has an unpleasant greasy feel to it, and as some have pointed out, it puts shine on your hands. For a few minutes, you&#x27;re walking around with slippery hands. Don&#x27;t do anything that involves sharp objects for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love it because it is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used which brings relief from painful skin cracks that I&#x27;ve tended to get during the periods of dry winter air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More good news: I&#x27;ve discovered how to, more or less, overcome the drawbacks of it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Apply less. A very tiny amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply often, I&#x27;d say to get optimum results I&#x27;m putting it on at least six times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Put a lot on right before bed. Obviously, when you don&#x27;t have to worry too much about slippery hands use generously to hydrate your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many lotions such as Aveeno and Gold Bond which don&#x27;t have this kind of greasy feel, but I&#x27;ve tended to still get skin cracks, which I then have to mend with super glue.</li>
    <li> Have used it for many years and love it</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  I&#x27;d never tried it before until here, and I have to admit, I really like.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions for very dry, sensitive skin.  It really helps soften the area to which it is applied.  I also like that it does not have a strong overpowering scent to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from having extremely dry skin for a number of years now and I&#x27;ve been looking for something that can moisturize my skin for hours on end without 10-15 minutes of working it into my skin. This lotion helps to moisturize even the driest areas of my skin within seconds, saving me from wasting several minutes reapplying lotion. My only real gripe is the greasy feeling it leaves after application. It stays for a good 50 minutes or so before going away, and if I&#x27;m interacting with other people during that time frame they&#x27;ll comment that my hands / arms etc feel &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I love everything Eucerin makes.  It does not irritate your skin and really keeps the dry spots away.  Great stuff.</li>
    <li> So I have eczema, really bad eczema. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of topical creams from the dermatologist which help, but they always tell me I have to find a good body lotion to use in conjunction with the medicine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I searched, and searched for something perfect. I&#x27;ve tried Lubriderm, Aveeno, Neutrogena, Nivea, BBW, Cetaphil and everything in between, until finally one of my friends told me to give Eucerin a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bit on the pricy side for OTC lotions, but trust me, it works like magic. When you first apply it it feels a little bit oily and heavy, but your skin will absorb it quickly and in about 20-30 minutes it feels normal again. This rich formula helps SO MUCH with my eczema and all the itching, and I don&#x27;t have to keep reapplying it throughout the day. Just a little in the morning and a lather after my shower is all I need a day. I also love that it is fragrance free, since fragrance irritates my eczema. I often found fragrances in Aveeno and Lubriderm, which I disliked a lot. I will never stop using this product!</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Can&#x27;t appreciate until tried</li>
    <li> I use this lotion all the time.  Of the hundreds (maybe that&#x27;s an exaggeration? I haven&#x27;t kept count.) I&#x27;ve tried, its my favorite. It leaves your skin feeling super healthy and moisturized for hours.  My friends always comment that I feel so soft.  My secret - this lotion.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin on my legs due to wearing compression for lymphedema. This is the best product for moisturizing without scent or being too greasy.</li>
    <li> I am trying desperately to move thru senior citizenship gracefully but there are something&#x27;s that just take you aback.  When I looked down and there was my mothers legs - skin a lot drier/even appeared crackled.  I knew I needed something more than what I was using - so my dermatologist recommended Eucerin.  I have been very pleased with this product.  The skin may not ever look 25 again but I like what I see since using Eucerin Intensive Repair.  Get Back Father Time!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, these days I have a bad case of dry skin especially on my face and feet almost all year long (I&#x27;m getting older); and although I have used a couple other moisturizing creams I wanted something that was even more effective. When I found this type of Eucerin&#x27;s \\&quot;Intensive Repair\\&quot; lotion for dry, flaky skin and tried it, I was very pleased. While it&#x27;s not the cheapest product out there for dry skin, it&#x27;s definitely been quite helpful. Eucerin \\&quot;Intensive Repair\\&quot; lotion gets deep into my skin and moisturizes it so that my skin feels softer to the touch right away--and my skin stops \\&quot;shedding!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, rub this in carefully; take about one or even two minutes to apply it, rubbing it in so that it will truly get into your skin. I find it to be helpful for the entire day; and it works well overnight to keep my skin in better shape then, too. In addition, the manufacturer claims this isn&#x27;t \\&quot;greasy;\\&quot; and they&#x27;re right! Yes, you might have to take just a second or two to rub off a slight residue from your hands after you&#x27;ve applied the lotion; but that&#x27;s about that. It won&#x27;t get greasy on your face, legs, or anywhere else you have dry skin, especially when you rub it in deep. If your skin does look a bit \\&quot;shiny\\&quot; after you&#x27;ve applied this lotion you may have accidentally applied it too thickly; try a little less lotion the next time and you should be OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about this product being able to help you exfoliate your skin; I cannot comment on this because I have not used this for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone who suffers from dry skin including eczema.</li>
    <li> I love other Eucerin products but this one, I detest.  I forgot that I had stuck it in my closet for a reason.  I ran out of one of my other lotions, pulled this one out and after I had slathered the thick, gooey, white cream all over me, I remembered why I had abandoned it.  This stuff does NOT absorb into my skin.  In fact, once on, my skin cannot breathe and I feel like I am smothering.  I was exhausted last night but could not sleep because of this horrifying coating all over my body.  It makes me hot and irritable.  Its as though my skin is struggling to breathe when I have it on.  I do not know if \\&quot;it works\\&quot; but I cannot stand it on my skin long enough to find out!  I was shocked by all the other positive reviews and wonder why my skin rejects this stuff!  Best to all who have found relief with this one!</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try.  I used it once and had to throw it away.  It was like dipping my hands in mineral oil.  It did not absorb and I had to wipe and then wash it off.  This was not for me!!</li>
    <li> vry sticky but works well and keeps your skin hydrated</li>
    <li> This is a great product that helps with dry skin.  But it does not fix your skin or repair it in any way. While it is on, life is more comfortable. After a shower, it is gone and you have to start again.  We like it better than other brands and have been using it off and on for years.</li>
    <li> My husband and I both love it.  Really the only lotion that works when the dry-skin situation has gotten out of control.  I am also allergic to most lotions, but have no problems with this one.</li>
    <li> I bought this because my doctor recommended it. I have been using this lotion every morning for about a month. It seems to absorb into the skin almost immediately making it moist and soft all day without feeling greasy. I plan to continue using it anytime my skin is dry.</li>
    <li> this cream is the only cream that worked for daughter who has terrible eczema..it moistens the skin and keeps it drying out quickly..a bit oily but works wonders...</li>
    <li> I love this product. Highly recommended for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Pretty pricey, but based on mixed reviews, thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have ichthyosis vulgaris ! (very dry skin), which is aggravated with the dry weather of winter.  I may rushing this review, but after two days of use, I see no benefit over the other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  It takes much longer to absorb into the skin, and leaves a distinct \\&quot;sheen\\&quot; on my hands.  Not to mention the greasy - sticky feeling.  But maybe there is a good side to that, and I will continue use for a while (bought the twin pack), and update the review if the long term results are improved.</li>
    <li> I use this occassionally as a handcream and I love it. It does make my hands feel softer and healed the cracking I had from overusing alcohol-based sanitizers. More importantly though, my mom and mother-in-law are devout users. They love the way it moisturizes their skin without leaving any sticky or greasy feel.</li>
    <li> My skin is extremely dry and this is the oly lotion on the market that moisturizes my skin and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> Both my young daughters have sensitive skin, and I used the very expensive creams and ointments recommended by their doctors and dermatologists. The doctors also mentioned Eucerin though, but I never used it, thinking the more expensive products would do a better job. I finally ended up trying it on them because we had it in the house (from my own use). This works just as well as the expensive stuff! In fact, I actually prefer it to many of those other creams, just because it&#x27;s not as greasy or thick/rich. This is now the only lotion I use on them. I slather it on them after their baths, and their skin is doing GREAT!</li>
    <li> Should have bought more the best lotion for the price</li>
    <li> I use this after showers.  It helps my dry itchy skin. I&#x27;ve tried other products, but this works best on the problems</li>
    <li> When it comes to lotions which I use on my hands overnight for moisturizing, I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to anything that feels like grease and still feels greasy when I wake up in the morning.  This is one of those products, and it does not work as well as others I have tried and used.  My hands, if not daily moisturized, will crack and bleed.  Even more surprising is that this is Dermatologist recommended.  I have learned that anything Dermatologist recommended&#x3D;greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for me.  At least I gave it a shot.</li>
    <li> Is an excellend product for controlling dry skin and preventing infections due to cracking dry skin resulting from chemo therapy.  It is also quite good at controlling the itching which goes along with my drying skin condition.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> good for feet thats it!&lt;br /&gt;make sure you have on thick socks,</li>
    <li> I am new to having some dry skin issues, and find this lotion to be quite beneficial for this purpose. It is a little greasy, but the&lt;br /&gt;lotion works, and is very soothing and healing.  I purchased the two pack and found that to be a good value.  Much easier to&lt;br /&gt;buy it on line, than to stand it line at my very busy drugstore.  Free  shipping and delivered to my front door.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely an intensive moisturizer, if by &amp;#34;moisturize&amp;#34; they mean coat your body in a sticky plastic-like film that absorbs very slowly. I know this is something eczema suffers appreciate but I&#x27;m not one, so if you&#x27;re just a regular jane like me with moderate winter-dry skin, this is probably not what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And yes, it has a weird bitter taste, so be careful when eating snacks after applying to your hands.)</li>
    <li> it is best cream ever!! i bought it twice and i think i will use it forever!!</li>
    <li> Eucerin was recommended to my husband by a medical doctor. He had diabetes. Eucerin was and is very helpful. I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for at least 10 years, may be more. It is absolutely awesome.  It does not only do maintenance of the skin. It actually repairs damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using Eucerin Lotion for over a year now, and love it.  It goes on with a little bit of a sheen, but quickly gets absorbed.  It is a great lotion for dry skin.</li>
    <li> This works extremely well for my son who has eczema</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion, excellent price.</li>
    <li> I was totally amazed with the results of this cream.  I have genetically dry skin and because I cook a lot, my hand which are always in  water are very dry.  After one application, I noticed a significant difference.  I also used it on total body, again with great results.  Its very gentle fragrance is kind to your sinuses and the convenient pump top dispensing bottle makes it easy to use.  After initially applying the cream, which is a little oily, but as it is absorbed into the skin, it isn&#x27;t that bad.  A trade off here, a little oily for relief of a dry skin condition.  Wonderful product.  It is definitely on my &amp;#34;Buy Again&amp;#34; list</li>
    <li> I had samples bottles of the Eucerin Plus Intensive Repair Lotion and loved it. Take notice of the PLUS in the title. The lotion I received in the mail does not have the same label as what is being advertised for sale. I do not like this lotion as well as the one with Plus on it. This lotion has a totally different feel and does not hydrate as well as the one with Plus on the label.  Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I tried using this daily for a week and it left my arms scarred.  I returned the bottle to Target.  I must say this was about 8 months ago and I have many many scars and some are very deep.  I am surprised that this did not happen to anyone else according to all the great reviews I read.</li>
    <li> I live in a really dry climate, having moved from a very humid one. After complaining of constant itchiness, eucerin was recommended to me. I think it&#x27;s the best for moisturizing dry skin.</li>
    <li> This has the right balance of protection and how it feels on my skins, not greasy yet is easy to apply</li>
    <li> I thought I was buying another Eucerin lotion, but this stuff is really bad.  It feels like you&#x27;re spreading glue over your skin; not smooth and hard to rub in.  Now I have two bottles :-(.  I don&#x27;t even get the impression that it is a particularly effective moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I use this product for dry skin and it is the best product I have found plus my dermatologist recommends it.  I can get it at any supermarket or drug store, but the ease of ordering with Amazon Prime makes it less expensive than getting in my car and driving to the store to pick it up!  I am getting spoiled because most everything I use can be purchased at Amazon without having to get out - especially in the cold weather!</li>
    <li> The only cream I know that stops dry skin flaking. I was told to put a generous amount all over my body on damp skin.</li>
    <li> Friend gave me a bit to try , bought it 10 min later .. the stuff is really good makes your skin shiny to the point where you think you had oil on you but dry to the touch, intrigued yet ? really deep moisturizer, its great right out of the shower .. i plan on using this on my face now since its practically winter time and my face gets really dry. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is that its really thick .. and  that makes it slightly harder to apply. But its not that much of an inconvenience... totally recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin.</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual face moisturizer and decided to use this until i got more of my usual stuff. BIG mistake. This stuff felt thick on my face, and really greasy. It was hard to rub in and does not absorb into the skin well. My face looked shiny like I put oil on it! I know the bottle says that its noncomedogenic, i i just feel like this stuff is clogging my pores. So basically my recommendation is dont use this product at all unless you have an extremely dry and flaky skin disease</li>
    <li> body lotion! I had done considerable research before I ordered this and it certainly lives up to its reputation! Easy to apply and skin feels smooth afterwards - no stickiness at all.</li>
    <li> My skin is very vulnerable to scratches that easily break the skin.  For some time I have used Euceran lotion to repair my dry skin.  It works well.  I thought this product was higher priced, but readily available through Amazon.  I sometimes can purchase for less at local stores, however available is sometimes a problem.</li>
    <li> Very cold winter and hands becoming very dry.  Found a small tube of this at the store and it worked wonders.  We had to have a bigger size of this around.  Use it after washing hands every time.</li>
    <li> It is very rich, so be preparred to let it sink into the skin or you will be giving greasy handshakes, but it is great for dry spots, especially elbows and knees.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years, nothing else compares. If I want to use a scented lotion, I will put a little on top of the Eucerin. The lady that does my pedicures informed me that this lotion has an exfoliant in it, which keeps the dead skin from builing up on the bottom of your feet. And that is perfectly true, I&#x27;ve switched and used others before and the skin on my feet were not the same. It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
    <li> Dry hands, dry feet, it makes no difference.  Eucerin (Intensive Repair) works for me...especially in the winter months.  It is not sticky and it absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> This can be used for day to day skin lotion but I find it works extremely well for the rough, dry, scaly areas that a person gets on occasion. Easily applies. Just a little needed at one time. Massage it in very well!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion best one out there that does exactly what it says it will do</li>
    <li> Good value for the dollar and Eucerin is the best lotion product on the market. I use this product myself as well as give it to my aging brother for his various skin problems.</li>
    <li> Received Eucerin lotion in a very timely manner.  Lotion is Intensive repair and works great.  I handle a lot of paper products and metal, my hands get very dry, this lotion really works for me.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am in my fifties and I have spent a fortune on all the expensive brands over the years. My skin has become drier over the years but this lotion makes my skin super soft.  I use it on my face also , I get told that my skin looks flawless all the time.  It works great under my make up too.  Why spent a fortune if this really works.</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion! Also nice for after shaving &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34; and after a shower makes your skin feel like silk! The best!</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I use this after my daily shower and it keeps my skin well hydrated and not oily at all.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent lotion for very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use them every day. Hardly recommended. Use just a little quantity.  Great results</li>
    <li> Eucerin Lotion is the only lotion my skin can handle.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for dry scaly skin.  I have those occasional little eczema bumps that I treat with hydrocortisone for healing, and use Eucerin to protect.  It is thick and has no irritants.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very thick and makes your skinny shine, but easily absorbed into your skin and leaves your skin feeling very smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought Eucerin Intensive Repair lotion last year and LOVED it! After two bottles, I saw a super store brand next to it and thought I could save a few bucks with the store brand. Let me warn you - it is NOT &#x27;Equal&#x27; to the name brand. I find that this lotion takes a few minutes to soak in, but once it does, it&#x27;s not greasy enough to be noticeable. This lotion transforms my dry, flaky skin on my legs and helps minimize the bumps on my upper arms. I put it on after the shower, again at night (in the winter), and then use exfoliating gloves in the shower. Repeat daily, and after about 3 days, my skin starts to look NORMAL (well, what&#x27;s normal for most people). I highly recommend you not try to save a few bucks and go with the real thing on this one!</li>
    <li> First of all, this product is extremely greasy.  After using this lotion, I can&#x27;t touch anything for half an hour without leaving a greasy film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, this product contains lanolin.  If you&#x27;re allergic to lanolin, as I am, avoid this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, this product contains AHAs, which increase your risk of sunburn.  The bottle does point this out, on the back, and was really surprising to me.  My skin sunburns easily and I avoid AHAs like the plague.  The bottle suggests wearing sunscreen and avoiding sun exposure for a week after using this product--I wanted to use it primarily on my hands, where it&#x27;s not really convenient to wear sunscreen or to cover up with clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this lotion is very disappointing.  I would suggest Vaseline or Cetaphil lotions instead.</li>
    <li> I have used the Eucerin Calming Creme for years but decided I needed something more moisturinzing. This goes on a little greasy at first but soon your skin soaks it up. I changed my routine to apply it first thing out of the shower. By the time I&#x27;m ready to dress my skin has absorbed  the lotion. It does put a layer of protection on your dry skin for the day. If your not willing to adjust your schedule so that the lotion has time to soak into your skin then buy the Calming Creme as it soaks in immediately but doesn&#x27;t give you the all day protection this one offers.</li>
    <li> I find this works well on my extremely dry skin (eczema).  The lotion feels greasy when applied, but the feeling fades as it dries out and it provides long lasting moisturization.  I will likely reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin this is the perfect solution. I have suffered with dry ankles and arms day and night. This lotion is the only one I have found that stops the itching.</li>
    <li> It has been a big help</li>
    <li> The main ingredient (after water) is mineral oil, so be advised: this is heavy duty stuff (don&#x27;t put out a candle with a fire extinguisher).  Those of us with the old-man (and woman) skin issues can be grateful Eucerin puts out this version.  And the seller is offering a twin pack at a very good price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for people who have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> this lotion was bought at a steal, a bottle this size cost more in store i got two at a great cost</li>
    <li> I was truly thankful to find the Lotion at a reasonable price and I&#x27;m pretty sure before the holidays I will be ordering some more Lotion from you or your company.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!&lt;br /&gt;And have a wonderful and blessed day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my lotion because I have very dry skin. I had lost hope of finding the right lotion. This is it!!! The best moisturizer and it&#x27;s not greasy it just plain awesome!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best body lotion (even use it on my face) I have ever used! With other lotions, the skin looks a feels good for a little while after applying it. But with the Eucerin that good look and feeling lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat</li>
    <li> I test out and try everything that i can get my hands on. And this is by far the best lotion yes it is a little greasy but it works. Absorbs good, and not to fast like other lotions or dry oils that personally leave my skin feeling so tight. Its a little more expensive. But even seems to be lighting up my stretch marks on my breast from pregnancy. If you have dry skin then this is definitely a must have. I personally wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face but some people do.</li>
    <li> Great for dry hands.  Highly recommend purchasing any of the Eucerin products.  My Dermatologist recommended this product to me years ago.  Cetaphil is also a great product line.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the best I&#x27;ve found for really dry skin.  I use it every day. I use a different type of Eucerin for my face (for sensitive skin) and like it as well.  The dermatolgist got me hooked on this lotion when I had a callous type growth on my wrist, I conitnually rubbed this lotion into it and it went away!</li>
    <li> This is effective, but awfully greasy and sort of sticky. It&#x27;s a great winter moisturizer. But it does repair skin.</li>
    <li> This applies too heavy and thick for my liking. I have to mix it with some water when applying. Even then, it leaves that sticky feeling. I would only recommend this to people who have extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> My legs and other areas get so dry in our cold winters.  This product makes a huge difference.  After just a week or so of use, along with exfoliating with a Salux in the shower, changed dry flaky skin, to smooth soft skin.  I&#x27;m ready for shorts.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!  I cannot praise it highly enough.  I&#x27;ve used almost every other product on themarket, but none came close to giving me the relief this one has.  Highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> My daughter is taking acne medication that drys out her skin so bad.  The dermatologist gave her a sample of eucerin to alleviate some of the dryness.  I purchased this product for her and it has helped a lot!</li>
    <li> Seems to releave dry skin but does not make a greazey mess.  Great product to use all year round. Great</li>
    <li> I like using the lotion.</li>
    <li> It is excellent for very, dry skin.  I also like the cream at bathtime.  Both products relieve itching and cracking.</li>
    <li> Very good for my dry skin,  I recommend it completely.Began using it right away.Buy some and try it now, hurry.</li>
    <li> I am prone to very dry skin (especially in the winter time).  During cold weather, my hands get so dry that they will crack and bleed without a good lotion.  This product is the best I have ever found.  Sure, it is a bit more pricey than other lotions out there, but this stuff is well worth the money.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t discover it sooner!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin due to having to take Niacin. With the use of this lotion, my skin has improved beyond all my expectations!</li>
    <li> I am a freckled, fair-skinned woman turning 31 this year. I have been using this exact product since I was 14. A freshman in high school, I suddenly developed burning, red patches of dry skin on my eyelids and face. I saw a dermatologist, as it was very uncomfortable and nothing was helping. He immediately recommended Eucerin, and I haven&#x27;t suffered since. I have been using this daily for 16 years, and will use it forever if I am able!&lt;br /&gt;Consistency:&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is quite thick compared to most facial lotions, which is perfect for me. The thinner lotions tend to sting or make my skin more dry. This stuff goes on thick, but immediately is absorbed into my face and hydrates it perfectly. It has never once burned or caused any discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;Routine:&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face everyday with a creamy, gentle one-step cleanser by Philosophy (Purity), and then use this lotion all over my face and eye area, my neck, and pretty much my whole body when I have time.&lt;br /&gt;I am told ALL the time that I look like I am 18, and I believe it is because I have used this product every day for so many years. I almost never experience dry skin anymore, and if I do, it&#x27;s gone within 24-48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, or suffer from dry, cracked skin or eczema anywhere on your body, use this! You will love how it feels and it will add years of youth and elasticity to your skin if you use it each day. Amazon has an amazing price on this for subscribe and save, too. Favorite product of ALL TIME.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE - The bottle says that this product can increase sensitivity to sun exposure. Definitely use a sunscreen if you are fair or sensitive as I am. My makeup has an SPF, as does my facial primer, and I prefer that to ordinary sunscreen on my face.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a good product, soothing for dry skin. It is slightly heavy but does absorb within 15 min. I was disappointed that it does not contain urea. Wish the Amazon listings would give detailed info on contents of lotions &amp; cosmetics.</li>
