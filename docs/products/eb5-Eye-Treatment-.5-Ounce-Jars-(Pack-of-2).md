      <li>right away-</li>
      <li>I am also happy to have found it on Amazon site, where the shipping charges are much less than buying it straight from the EB5.com company.</li>
      <li>There are far too many solid products from more reputible and well known companies to bother with a company that seems to be, well, sketchy.</li>
      <li>The eye treatment was only ok.  </li>
      <li>And in fact, many times I tried to \\&quot;ween\\&quot; myself from this product, tried something else, but I always end up going back to it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This will be my last purchase for sure.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more EB5 in the future.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was a fluke the first time around.  </li>
      <li>The texture of eb5 is very comforting to your skin!</li>
      <li>Just make sure not to get it into your eyes, it will sting, but that&#x27;s true about all the other gels and creams.  </li>

      <li>It is for certain that these items have been tampered with.</li>
      <li>I recomend this product to every one!I also were given very expencive products by my children on my bday, but it was not like eb5</li>
      <li>One of the jars when I took it out of the package the whole lid just fell off.</li>
      <li>You will really like this</li>
      <li>, it is worth the try with not much to loose.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this gel.</li>
      <li>cant live without it</li>
      <li>For some reason after I was using this for a while it really made the skin underneath my eyes very swollen and red.  </li>
      <li>The price is right and it works way better than other more expensive products.  </li>
      <li>If you are still looking for the best nutrient for your eyes, try this gel, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
      <li>The other one obviously had more product in it.  </li>
      <li>I AM 66 YEARS OLD</li>
      <li>Creamy and easy to apply very little at a time.</li>
      <li>I ordered based on other reviews thinking it was cheap enough to take a chance on</li>
      <li>I have spent thousands on skin care products from dermatlogists and Plastic Surgeons with less than satisfying results.</li>
      <li>As another reviewer wrote, one of the jars I received was only about half full.  </li>
      <li>I received the two jars today and one is only half full.</li>
      <li>I will be ordering directly from the eb5 company next time.</li>
      <li>The cream itself seems to be helping after only a few days, more with \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; than with wrinkles or dark circles, but it&#x27;s too soon too tell.  </li>
      <li>I have tried more expensive products and did a split face test; eb5 wins hands down.  </li>
      <li>eb5 eye gel really minimizes wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
      <li>I have been using EB5 Eye Gel for at least 15 years now, and as you can imagine I love it, or else I would switch to some other product by now.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The eye treatment was only ok.  I was hoping this cream would not be so shiny that it&#x27;s so noticeable I&#x27;m wearing an eye treatment with all the brightness.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eb5 eye cream for many years, and love the product.  However, this recent shipment was poor quality.  The two little jars of cream are not even half full, and the cream is so thick that I have difficulty spreading it on the skin around my eyes (which is tender skin to begin with).  It&#x27;s like the product has lost its moisture or something.  It&#x27;s a pain to have to box it up and return it, so I guess I&#x27;ll keep it and struggle with it trying to make it work.  I will be ordering directly from the eb5 company next time.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive eye cream that works well.  I tried other brands looking for the best product at a reasonable price and this is it.</li>
    <li> I found this product in a local store and decided to give it a try. I have spent thousands on skin care products from dermatlogists and Plastic Surgeons with less than satisfying results. My skin is dry and after applying  other products my skin would  still feel tight and dry- not what I desired. My skin has felt wonderful after 3 months of eb5. I feel this product is superior than all products I have used in the past. My skin no longer feels as dry nor looks as wrinkled. I am in my 50&#x27;s. Also, my face does not break out or my pores do not clog with eb5. I just ordered another supply. Thanks for such a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT CREAM FOR THE EYES.  THIS IS ALL I HAVE USED FOR YEARS AND PEOPLE DO TELL ME WHEN THEY SEE A PICTURE, YOUR EYES ARE NEVER PUFFED.  HOW IN THE WORLD DO YOU KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING?  I TELL THEM ABOUT THE CREAM.  I AM 66 YEARS OLD AND I DO THINK IT HELPS.</li>
    <li> I received the two jars today and one is only half full. Neither of the jars  inside paper seeler where intack. One of the jars when I took it out of the package the whole lid just fell off. It is for certain that these items have been tampered with.</li>
    <li> I have been using EB5 Eye Gel for at least 15 years now, and as you can imagine I love it, or else I would switch to some other product by now. And in fact, many times I tried to \\&quot;ween\\&quot; myself from this product, tried something else, but I always end up going back to it. This gel makes your skin under your eyes so soft and moist and delicate looking, nothing compares to that in my opinion. Just make sure not to get it into your eyes, it will sting, but that&#x27;s true about all the other gels and creams.

If you are still looking for the best nutrient for your eyes, try this gel, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really love love this product, have benn using it for many years! I recomend this product to every one!I also were given very expencive products by my children on my bday, but it was not like eb5 I alway continue with eb5 and ecorage my friends to use it.</li>
    <li> eb5 eye gel really minimizes wrinkles and dark circles. I have tried more expensive products and did a split face test; eb5 wins hands down.  I highly recommend this gel.</li>
    <li> For some reason after I was using this for a while it really made the skin underneath my eyes very swollen and red.  I stopped using it for a while and the redness went away.  As soon as i started using the product again it came back so i guess something in it doesn&#x27;t work with my skin</li>
    <li> I have used eb5 for more then 15 years. I continually receive compliments on the look of my complexion.    The texture of eb5 is very comforting to your skin!</li>
    <li> This was my second purchase of this item.  I thought it was a fluke the first time around.  But on my last order, it was worse!  There was barely&lt;br /&gt;a quarter of the creme in both of the bottles!&lt;br /&gt;This will be my last purchase for sure.  Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I have been using it for years. The store I usually buy it from doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore...thank God for Amazon! The product was delivered promptly and in great condition.</li>
    <li> I bought this as well as the EB5 face cream looking for a new night cream and am very excited with these products!  I will be ordering more EB5 in the future.  The price is right and it works way better than other more expensive products.  I am very impressed with EB5 in the last 3 weeks using it and see immediate results!  I ordered based on other reviews thinking it was cheap enough to take a chance on and I will stick with this product now! Amazon sells it cheaper than the website.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and this has shown results I can see and feel right away- I was using Strivectin and Anew products (which smelled horrible). This is lovely- I put it on , wait, and reapply. You will really like this , it is worth the try with not much to loose. I am looking foward to ordering some of their other products as well.</li>
    <li> Greatest product ever &#x27;EB5&#x27; eye treatment.  I use all &amp;#34;EB5&amp;#34; products; and they all work.  Creamy and easy to apply very little at a time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now and continue to notice its effects.  Very pleased to find it available through Amazon and will always check back when needed.  Received the item promptly; overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for over 5 years...LOVE it...cant live without it..keeps puffiness down with younger looking eyes</li>
    <li> As another reviewer wrote, one of the jars I received was only about half full.  The other one obviously had more product in it.  I don&#x27;t think this is an Amazon.com error as the packages seemed to come prepackaged...it just seemed a little sketchy.  It was quite obvious there was a difference in the two jars (I opened them both after reading the reviews on here).    The cream itself seems to be helping after only a few days, more with \\&quot;plumping\\&quot; than with wrinkles or dark circles, but it&#x27;s too soon too tell.  However, given the status of the jars, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d order this product again - I&#x27;m leary of a company that has such poor quality control. There are far too many solid products from more reputible and well known companies to bother with a company that seems to be, well, sketchy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product to use around the eyes.  I have used other eye products around the eyes and my eyes immediately started to burn and make my eyes tear up.  Have been using this product for a long time.</li>
    <li> This product takes years off , of my appearance - my mirror knows best &amp; like to share this product to everybody .</li>
    <li> It works for me but not for the price. I think it&#x27;s overrated by the product description that comes with it. I can only recommend it for much less price.</li>
    <li> This cream is a l remarkable cfream..&lt;br /&gt;Takes care of circles under eyes&lt;br /&gt;And smooth skin also&lt;br /&gt;Been using for30 plus years.&lt;br /&gt;Just love it...</li>
