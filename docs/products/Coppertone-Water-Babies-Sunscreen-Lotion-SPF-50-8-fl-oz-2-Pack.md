      <li>And which I love the most is</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>and it was the most intense burning sensation I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my eyes.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice to see the 70 SPF available here, but the 50 did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>At some point we realized that we were going to need more than these two bottles</li>

      <li>it has very strong smell, and it not tear free.</li>

      <li>Both me and my baby have sensitive skin and this product works great.</li>
      <li>The fact that it&#x27;s \\&quot;water babies\\&quot; and touted for babies made me think it would be tear free and OK to apply to the face.  </li>
      <li>They may not excrete it as easily.  </li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly with very light scent</li>
      <li>This product is very very good and very valid,I will buy  this product more next time.</li>
      <li>How could a sunscreen for babies not be tear free?</li>
      <li>It says &#x27;tear free&#x27;</li>
      <li>(it kept my and my child&#x27;s sensitive, fair skin from burning)</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love it very much</li>
      <li>it took me a while to clean the spill-over.</li>
      <li>It was 92 degrees today and so far I liked this sun screen.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT&#x27;S VERY SMOOTHY AND MOISTURE , PROTECTION  BABY  </li>
      <li>We live in South Florida and spend most of our free time in the sun.  </li>
      <li>Definately for young children, not adults [based mostly on fragrance].</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>This sunscreen contains two ingredients, homosalate (14%) and oxybenzone (4%), which are strongly suspected of being carcinogenic, particularly in the presence of sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super fast shipper.  </li>
      <li>It worked well in the hot and humid climates and under blazing sun.</li>
      <li>They absorb more of the chemical relative to their weight.  </li>
      <li>did research on this product before purchasing it, but wasn&#x27;t aware of the oxybenzone risk.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There was some oily residue when you first apply the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>We used the higher protection on the kids from then on and my wife and I used the 50 SPF.  </li>
      <li>It was hot and sweaty at the beach</li>
      <li>long term using this product starting from new born, very good for baby.</li>
      <li>We were at Walmart looking for another \\&quot;Pure and Simple\\</li>
      <li>Save your money, your time, and your child&#x27;s health and look for the \\&quot;pure and simple\\&quot; tag when buying Coppertone products.</li>
      <li>Very inexpensive product.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t think it works very well.  </li>
      <li>According to the Environmental Working Group, oxybenzone is \\&quot;a synthetic chemical that absorbs the sun&#x27;s rays but also readily penetrates the skin.</li>
      <li>it set very well</li>
      <li>/&gt;Sunscreen works very well.&lt;br /&gt;i like my color now</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I am very dissatisfied</li>
      <li>but truthfully it did glide like butter like a smell of john son baby very clear to this product i tested out to wear it with my foundation( almay smart shade) and powder ( cover girl loose )</li>
      <li>Experts warn that children are at greater risk from oxybenzone and other hormone-disrupting substances than adults.  </li>
      <li>However, when you shower later that night, you&#x27;ll feel the oily residue again as you clean it off.  </li>
      <li>After a couple of days back in the real world, everything has cleared right</li>
      <li>comfortable, no much oil.</li>
      <li>it is very old packing with very early production dates.</li>
      <li>and we lathered them up pretty well a three times per day several days in a row</li>
      <li>Pretty greasy &amp; if you are outside for</li>
      <li>Holy WOW!</li>
      <li>but clearly it burns his eyes.  </li>
      <li>old products</li>
      <li>it is now 2 years old, continue this brand.</li>
      <li>I have an 11 month old baby, and three year old.  </li>
      <li>It can disrupt the body&#x27;s natural hormones.</li>
      <li>And their developing bodies are particularly sensitive to hormonal</li>
      <li>Smells a little like a clean baby.</li>
      <li>It is so similar in packaging to the decent sunscreen they carry that it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed.</li>
      <li>&quot; version of this sunscreen, but Walmart had only this particular type of sunscreen with the oxybenzone in it.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for my two-year old son last summer.</li>
      <li>We used three different kinds of sunscreen lotion and so far, we like this a lot.  </li>
      <li>so we went to the store and purchased the same product, but the new one is SPF 70 (we paid about the same price at the local grocery as we did through Amazon).  </li>
      <li>This stuff may have been voted a top sunscreen this year by Consumer Reports (2015), but it STINKS to high heaven!</li>
      <li>Not bad for me, but for my kids, I am not sure!</li>

<li> I will suggest other people.</li>
<li> My skin is dry and It&#x27;s a little oil.</li>
<li> If you have ANY kind of working olfactory system, this horrible, overpoweringly gross, synthetic scent will haunt you for HOURS.</li>
<li> It is a thick white lotion to put on your skin, but i read the ones that absorb into your skin do not have zinc and may cause cancer(chemicals)..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Received as expected and as described</li>
    <li> i not use it now, but i think maybe is good for me . and my friends always like it. so i think s good</li>
    <li> We used this product on a cruise through the Caribbean and Panama Canal and at stops in several tropical countries.  It worked well in the hot and humid climates and under blazing sun.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s ok. Pretty greasy &amp; if you are outside for awhile/alot one of these bottles might not last very long.</li>
    <li> Great for preventing burns on the kids.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen seems to work well (it kept my and my child&#x27;s sensitive, fair skin from burning) BUT it contains oxybenzone. According to the Environmental Working Group, oxybenzone is \\&quot;a synthetic chemical that absorbs the sun&#x27;s rays but also readily penetrates the skin. It can disrupt the body&#x27;s natural hormones. It can also cause allergic reactions. Experts warn that children are at greater risk from oxybenzone and other hormone-disrupting substances than adults.  They absorb more of the chemical relative to their weight.  They may not excrete it as easily.  And their developing bodies are particularly sensitive to hormonal changes.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did research on this product before purchasing it, but wasn&#x27;t aware of the oxybenzone risk. I&#x27;m disgusted that the company would include it in a product that is marketed for children.</li>
    <li> i didn&#x27;t use it now.but so many friends said it&#x27;s very good . then i bought it .</li>
    <li> This stuff may have been voted a top sunscreen this year by Consumer Reports (2015), but it STINKS to high heaven! Holy WOW! My daughter could not stand the smell of it at all. If you have ANY kind of working olfactory system, this horrible, overpoweringly gross, synthetic scent will haunt you for HOURS. This crap REEKS!</li>
    <li> works great for light eye and light skin folks</li>
    <li> Super fast shipper.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> #1 rated sunscreen for kids by consumer reports this year.  Use it for our three kids who are 3 and under for all activities.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my two-year old son last summer. He has never experienced skin problem with this sunscreen. I also use it for myself. I like it&#x27;s smell.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly with very light scent</li>
    <li> Both me and my baby have sensitive skin and this product works great.  Just be careful not to let baby get it in his/her eyes - it stings.</li>
    <li> Dr. Recommended to me</li>
    <li> My family just returned from a two week Florida trip and I ordered this in advance and had it shipped to our destination.  I am happy to report that we had ZERO sunburns!  I have an 11 month old baby, and three year old.  Additionally, my wife and I used this product on ourselves too.  At some point we realized that we were going to need more than these two bottles so we went to the store and purchased the same product, but the new one is SPF 70 (we paid about the same price at the local grocery as we did through Amazon).  We used the higher protection on the kids from then on and my wife and I used the 50 SPF.  It would be nice to see the 70 SPF available here, but the 50 did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was some oily residue when you first apply the sunscreen.  Within a few minutes, it was not a bother.  However, when you shower later that night, you&#x27;ll feel the oily residue again as you clean it off.  Once applied and rubbed in, there is no white residue look like some other screens.  However, both of our kids did develop a little rash.  It was hot and sweaty at the beach and we lathered them up pretty well a three times per day several days in a row so we were not surprised or alarmed.  After a couple of days back in the real world, everything has cleared right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can recommend this sunscreen for kids and adults!</li>
    <li> Heard of this brand of something good, buy, summer goes out with, for children, but also to buy, will also recommend to friends with children my mother</li>
    <li> the packing is different with any one which are selling on the coppertone offical website, i gusse it is very old packing with very early production dates. it has very strong smell, and it not tear free.</li>
    <li> Consumers Report says that this is the best sun tan loation.  I agree.</li>
    <li> It was 92 degrees today and so far I liked this sun screen.  Will update in few weeks.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and then was told they could not use it because it was not tear free!!  How could a sunscreen for babies not be tear free?</li>
    <li> In summer, very good. Really effective against sun damage to the skin. Bought several bottles. Share with the amount of friends.</li>
    <li> We used this just recently in St. Martin and St. Thomas.  We all use this product, not just on our toddler but on us!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because consumer reports said this was the best sunscreen. It is a thick white lotion to put on your skin, but i read the ones that absorb into your skin do not have zinc and may cause cancer(chemicals).. But i wore this on a 90 degree day, i was just going to the park for 2 hours, not sunbathing.. i didn&#x27;t burn but i got a tan. an spf of 50 should not be giving me a tan/</li>
    <li> if I could give 0 star, I would. Lotion expires on 9.14. How could I use it in 2 months?</li>
    <li> I heard Water Babies Sunscreen is very good to prevent sunlight from my friend, and then I bought it. It is really good and I will recommend it to my other friends who don&#x27;t know it.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen.  It is the only one I have found that doesn&#x27;t make my sons&#x27; eyes water.  I even use it on myself when we are going to the beach...    -Denise</li>
    <li> comfortable, no much oil.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 packages. When I received, the lids were open and the cream spilt over. The spilt cream was all over and tainted the outer packages. Why wouldn&#x27;t wrap them firmly and sealed the lids? It was so disappointing.</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and It&#x27;s a little oil. And which I love the most is when I put them on my face,they looks transparent rather than too white.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen contains two ingredients, homosalate (14%) and oxybenzone (4%), which are strongly suspected of being carcinogenic, particularly in the presence of sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coppertone makes a product with near-identical packaging, but with the subtle \\&quot;pure and simple\\&quot; tag slipped in, which does not contain these ingredients and is far safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We fell for the unclear packaging and find ourselves with two bottles of this unacceptable product to be returned. Save your money, your time, and your child&#x27;s health and look for the \\&quot;pure and simple\\&quot; tag when buying Coppertone products.</li>
    <li> Smells a little like a clean baby. I guess that&#x27;s better than sunscreen that smells like a dirty baby. Good luck with your sun hygeine.</li>
    <li> long term using this product starting from new born, very good for baby. it is now 2 years old, continue this brand.</li>
    <li> Definately for young children, not adults [based mostly on fragrance].</li>

    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT&#x27;S VERY SMOOTHY AND MOISTURE , PROTECTION  BABY  SKIN FROM BURNING IN THE SUN. GOOD CHOICE FOR EVERY MUM.</li>
    <li> it arrive on time seen the lotion was white thought it would white marks on my skin but truthfully it did glide like butter like a smell of john son baby very clear to this product i tested out to wear it with my foundation( almay smart shade) and powder ( cover girl loose ) it set very well i adore it a lot so please with the results can not and will not complain</li>
    <li> Two months ago, my husband and I went to Boracay, Philippines where there is lots and lots of sunshine.  We used three different kinds of sunscreen lotion and so far, we like this a lot.  Does not easily come off.  But of course, even though it&#x27;s SPF 50 we still re-applied it after 30-60 mins of swimming or being out in the sun.  Recommended for kids and adults alike!</li>
    <li> Both me and my baby have sensitive skin and this product works great. Just be careful not to let baby get it in his/her eyes - it stings</li>
    <li> Just as advertised and less than the corner drug store</li>
    <li> Shelf life was in 2014 October，and there is a slight smell~I bought 4 bottles~⊙﹏⊙b</li>
    <li> This product (Coppertone Water Babies Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 50, 8 fl oz, 2-Pack ) is very good, so Iwill buy this item again and tell my another friend buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of days, but I had read great recommendations from dermatologists as well as pediatricians!</li>
    <li> I was in 2014 April to buy goods, I get the goods, carefully check, 2014 September will expire. I am very dissatisfied</li>
    <li> Not bad for me, but for my kids, I am not sure!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting this on my son for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed his eyes are constantly burning and bloodshot.  Finally my husband suggested it might be the sunscreen.  I looked on here and see that other people have had the same problem with this stuff.  It says &#x27;tear free&#x27; but clearly it burns his eyes.  I also don&#x27;t think it works very well.  I put it all over my face today and I was out in the sun for only about an hour and I have a slight burn.</li>
    <li> the summer  i ues it go to the beach.&lt;br /&gt;i love it very much&lt;br /&gt;Sunscreen works very well.&lt;br /&gt;i like my color now</li>
    <li> Used consumer reports to make a purchasing decision on this. Works well.</li>
    <li> As a sunscreen, yes, it works, and blocks the rays.  Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, do NOT apply this to your face... I put it on my face prior to a hike and halfway through the hike had to pour water on my face.... as I perspired it got in my eyes and it was the most intense burning sensation I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my eyes.  TERRIBLE.  The fact that it&#x27;s \\&quot;water babies\\&quot; and touted for babies made me think it would be tear free and OK to apply to the face.  As I type this 4 hours later, my eyes are still watering.  Time to go flush them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself and your baby a favor and skip this product.</li>
    <li> it will be expired in november . old products</li>
    <li> when I got them, the contents are everywhere...it took me a while to clean the spill-over.I am disappointed about the package..it is not safe and not considerate..</li>
    <li> This product is very very good and very valid,I will buy  this product more next time.I will suggest other people.</li>
    <li> We live in South Florida and spend most of our free time in the sun.  This is a very good water and sweat resistant sunscreen.  It&#x27;s all we use.</li>
    <li> Good smell. Very inexpensive product. I was recommended by friends. Now I like it and would like to recommend it to other people.</li>
    <li> This has oxybenzone which should just be flat out avoided. It is so similar in packaging to the decent sunscreen they carry that it shouldn&#x27;t be allowed. We were at Walmart looking for another \\&quot;Pure and Simple\\&quot; version of this sunscreen, but Walmart had only this particular type of sunscreen with the oxybenzone in it. No thank you. Why go for these chemicals when you can buy the micronized zinc or titanium particle sunscreens that give you an actual physical barrier between you and the sun?</li>
