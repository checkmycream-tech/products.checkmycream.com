      <li>great stuff</li>
      <li>MY GUMS TO BE HEALTHY!!</li>
      <li>Thus I have been using a mouthwash that does not taste good at all.  </li>
      <li>This is amazing stuff</li>
      <li>and I needed more after my sample bottle from the dentist ran out.  </li>
      <li>Taste is much better than the lemon one, would recommend this over it any day.</li>

<li> I say that because I have very sensitive gums and this calms them down almost immediately.</li>
<li> No more bleeding gums.</li>
<li> I guess the product works, I don&#x27;t really know since it has only been used 3 times because the taste is so awful!</li>
<li> Very small bottle for the price.</li>
<li> They should at least have the courtesy to acknowledge the complaints!</li>
<li> I sent you my complaint that was never answered!  </li>
<li> I would have given it 5 stars, but the taste is pretty awful and tastes nothing like mint.</li>
<li> I think you should overhaul your complaint department!!!  </li>
<li> It is very expensive!!!</li>

    <li> I really liked this, my only complaint is that after a week or so of non use the salt in it (im assuming) bunched up and started floating around and I had to discard of it.</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff and I needed more after my sample bottle from the dentist ran out.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works really well after wisdom teeth extraction..super pleased!</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash, especially after dental care and canker sores, soothe, refresh and helps with the healing process</li>
    <li> This product is pretty great as far as healing mouth sores. I would have given it 5 stars, but the taste is pretty awful and tastes nothing like mint.</li>
    <li> I sent you my complaint that was never answered!  I asked for Lemon flavored and did not receive it!  Thus I have been using a mouthwash that does not taste good at all.  I think you should overhaul your complaint department!!!  They should at least have the courtesy to acknowledge the complaints!</li>
    <li> Dentist recommended it.  I had a bleeding gum situation and needed some work done.  Fortunately, nothing serious, but enough to make me pay more attention.  She gave me a bottle of H2O Ocean to use and told me to use it.  I did.  I love the way my mouth feels each time I gargle with it...I know it&#x27;s clean.  I use it three times a day.  No more bleeding gums.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;ll last 7 days Only.</li>
    <li> Really like this and has a great taste</li>
    <li> great stuff no chemicals</li>
    <li> I work for a dentist and get free mouthwash if I want;however, I love this mouthwash. Many people don&#x27;t like it but I do. It is very expensive!!! Very small bottle for the price.</li>
    <li> H2Ocean is the best mouthwash I have ever used. I say that because I have very sensitive gums and this calms them down almost immediately. It also has some healing qualities. If I am getting a canker sore, it disappears within hours. I would highly recommend H2Ocean to anyone who experiences sensitive oral tissues.</li>
    <li> I received some of this product with a recent oral piercing. I liked it so much, I ordered more for everyday use. It&#x27;s salty but has just the right amount of mint too. Leaves breath fresh and it doesn&#x27;t burn like regular mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I used this after some extractions that I had on my rear teeth and I am pretty sure it is the main reason that I healed extremely fast!</li>
    <li> This brand is my favorite for helping heal piercings and tattoos. I recently got my tongue pierced and bought this product. My tongue healed much faster than what the piercer said it would. I&#x27;m completely loyal to this brand and will probably never use another for piercings and tattoos.</li>
    <li> Mild minty flavor with a strong salt taste. Works well, doesn&#x27;t stink like the lemon flavor and is making my tongue split bearable. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Currently using it for healing tongue piercing love the way it feels after I use it!</li>
    <li> MY DENTIST RECOMMENDED I USE THIS MOUTH WASH...I&#x27;VE BEEN USING FOR 2 YEARS NOW &amp; IT HAS&lt;br /&gt;HELPED MY GUMS TO BE HEALTHY!!</li>
    <li> It taste gross but it helps in so many ways</li>
    <li> Taste is much better than the lemon one, would recommend this over it any day. Never had any issues with piercings because of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of xylitol and have tried a bunch of different types. The addition of sea salt helps a bunch, and is great for when you have a mouth sore (like when I accidentally bite the side of my mouth). Really a great product!</li>
    <li> Bought this product for a monroe piercing. I guess the product works, I don&#x27;t really know since it has only been used 3 times because the taste is so awful!</li>
