### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Its awesome for this reason.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>I just reordered and plan to continue using - best quality to price option</li>
      <li>Very Happy!</li>
      <li>Awesome smell and texture.</li>
      <li>I use it every day, and in addition to the hair loss benefits, it is an excellent every day shampoo.     </li>
      <li>I had been searching for the best shampoo for hair loss and dandruff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seeing this has improved my confidence greatly!</li>
      <li>Best shampoo ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s hair growth claims, but it feels great!</li>
      <li>This is the best.  </li>
      <li>This is a very good shampoo!</li>

      <li>This does an incredible job of doing what those shampoos do, and contain no sulfates, or parabens!</li>
      <li>The shampoo also smells great!</li>
      <li>However, I can say that it has been the best product for my dandruff that I have ever come across.</li>
      <li>Where I do believe it has helped hair growth, I would not recommend this product alone to fight hair loss -- I believe it is best used with 5% Minoxidil.</li>
      <li>and I have to say this is the best hair loss product I have ever used.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good quality shampoo, my scalp feels noticeably healthier, my hair seems to be growing slightly faster. My hair seems to be shedding less as well, it&#x27;s not a miracle workernel but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s certainly helping me combat hair loss long with using Minoxidil. The aloe Vera in the shampoo feels very soothing as well, and this has been the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used for dandruff as well, I didn&#x27;t have it very bad before but since I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo there&#x27;s been no trace of it. I definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Product seems to work well when it comes to removing scalp build up. Smells really nice. But the consistency is so think and hard to squeeze the shampoo out of the bottle. I have not seen any changes in hairloss yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/16&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is fantastic. They replaced my bottle because of the bottle cap issues i was having. Bought another bottle as well on top of that. I have only been using for about 2 months. Will post reviews in another 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about my hair, and a few months ago I had a red rash on my scalp (I&#x27;m a 31yr old male) that wouldn&#x27;t go away. It would constantly itch, crust, and flake into dandruff except it looked worse than a typical scalp issue. I did some google work to find what it might be, and turns out it was possibly not just typical dandruff but a fungal infection. I checked for what ingredients help treat it, and searched for shampoos that contained the ingredient (Ketoconazole) and this one had good reviews. After a few days I saw improvement, and within 2 weeks there was no sign of an issue. I continued to use it for  full month after to be safe, and haven&#x27;t had the issue return (over 6 mos later). I&#x27;d definitely recommend giving it a shot, since nothing else (Delsun, head and shoulders, etc) worked for me on my condition.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for the best shampoo for hair loss and dandruff. My hair used to shed a lot and dandruff used to be a constant problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cause of my hair shedding and thinning it could have either been because of natural aging or because of this over-the-counter testosterone booster I was taking. I hate losing hair and I don’t like thin hair or dandruff. I tried out, Nizoral, as I heard it was good for my issues --- But, I needed something better that would really cure me of my excessive hair loss, thinning and dandruff issues once and for all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m so glad I found Regenepure Dr hair loss shampoo for hair growth and scalp treatment. It works GREAT --- it has given my hair a youthful look as the volume has really come back in and I’m not experiencing hair loss anymore. Not to mention, I’m never worried about dandruff anymore as it solved that for me too. I can confidently say that Regenepure Dr is definitely the best shampoo out there after researching this topic extensively and trying so many shampoos and products for myself. Added bonus is your scalp and head just feel really refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> I, like most people that have looked at this product, am beginning to lose my hair to Male Pattern Baldness.  My research online brought me to this product, and I was extremely hopeful that this, in combination with minoxidil, would help me in the battle against the bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use a significant amount of hair fell out, which I had never experienced (my prior hairloss was limited to 2 hairs on my hand in the shower; this left 10 or more).  I used it in combination with the other Regenepure product, tried this twice, and still had these awful results.  In addition, it left my hair feeling extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been left disillusioned by how much companies are willing to lie and leave fake reviews about the effect of their product, especially in the realm of male pattern baldness treatments.  Oh well.  Good ol&#x27; human greed, right??</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with my itchy scalp and increasing hair loss.  After about 3 weeks of use, I still have a bit of itching  (less, tho) and today I found ZERO hair in the shower drain !!  Since hubbly had even remarked at how much hair he&#x27;d notice in the shower, this has really impressed me.  Have just ordered the Regenepure NT treatment in hopes of tackling the itchiness, used together. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
    <li> Have been using for almost 2 years.  Cleans my scalp and stops any itching without the medicinal smell.</li>
    <li> My skin is terribly allergic to most skin-care products, including Neutrogena. I use a very plain olive oil soap and other very plain products without perfumes (including the wonderful Aveeno fragrance-free moisturizing lotion), and not much else. I have very long hair and was using a shampoo for years, but they obviously changed their formulation because the bottle art changed and at the same time I suddenly could not use it without an itchy rash forming on my scalp. I tried probably 30 different shampoos with no luck. During this time, I also developed a type of dandruff that caused my hair to thin by about 10-15% (fall out generally all over).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frantically searching the internet for sensitive scalp advice and came across one person recommending Regenepure dr in a blog. The first time I used it, it made my scalp tingle pleasantly (due to menthol or something like that in there), and within a couple days of daily use - relief! My scalp was normal, no rash, no dandruff and my hair was clean and shiny. Within a couple months of usage, my hair noticeably grew back very thick, like normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, but I don&#x27;t mind since it works so well. Your hair will get tired of any one product day-after-day, so sometimes I change off to another plain shampoo for a day or two so I can get the like-new results again when I switch back. A bottle lasts me a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have told other people about this product, and everyone speaks well of their own experiences with it. Highly, highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This product was purchased to try and replace Nizoral which was pulled from the market without notice. I also bought it because it claims to be an American product. However, this shampoo in no way measures up to Nizoral. I am sorely disappointed. I&#x27;m going to see what my doctor can do because I have found nothing on store shelves that can compete with Nizoral.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for the past couple of years and I&#x27;ve been quite happy with the results.  It&#x27;s not a a fix for hair loss but it does provide you with healthy, thicker looking hair.  I will continue to use this product for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> great product...you can feel it is working.</li>
    <li> Im almost 20 and my hair was thinning a very little bit ..came in today used it now my hair is back like it was when I was 15 on the first day and I know it&#x27;s gonna get better I thank God for this I&#x27;m already healed thank God whoever reads this get it !!! God Bless</li>
    <li> Good quality, as advertised.</li>
    <li> I have tried every dandruff shampoo on the market, all with out success. My scalp was itchy and every time I combed me hair the amount of dandruff that would come out was unimaginable. It honestly looked as if it were snowing when I combed my hair. Frustrated with every thing I decided to keep looking. I tried apple cider vinegar, I tried olive oil, and I tried the tar shampoos, all had no effect on my dandruff.     This shampoo works. It really works. And for that it&#x27;s worth every penny in the world to me. My hair no longer has dandruff and even though I didn&#x27;t need my hair to be any fuller, it did a great job making my hair stronger.    If you are in the market for a shampoo to cure your severe dandruff, look no further, finally you have found something that will work.    This shampoo is awesome.</li>
    <li> I bought this because due to relaxing my hair by putting I perms it did something negative to my scalp my scalp felt so wet it was like touching a sore and my scalp was itching bad and man I had alot of flaking all i had to do was rub my hair and there were alot on the White pAper it was so annoying itching and scratching my head I knew something was wrong I&#x27;ve tried that popular Call selsun blue that didn&#x27;t help at all but this it did the job now I&#x27;m back to the full health of my scalp if u have severe itching scalp and dandruff try this it should help u gotta use it like this take your small thin comb in the shower or bath and comb out this shampoo back and forth wait for 5 minutes or more wash out continue each time u shower of bath u will notice significant results try it</li>
    <li> I used to use Nizoral shampoo for my overly dry scalp.  I have tried many products and Nizoral was the only thing that would work.  I was shocked that they took it off the market.  I read many reviews and bought this product as a result.  It is expensive, but it does work.  The smell is great.  It smells like spearmint which is really nice.  It also doesn&#x27;t have a burning sensation that other shampoos do.  I use it a couple of times a week and it takes the itching away.  If considering this shampoo, don&#x27;t hesitate any longer.</li>
    <li> Been using this product about 1&amp;1/2 yrs. and its slowed down my hair loss and actually has grown some new hair in places! My hair gets greasy after a day or two so I use Nature&#x27;s Gate biotin shampoo first and that helps the Regenepure DR last much longer. You can also use the Regenepure NT shampoo first, then the DR, then the NT again. Make sure you you leave the DR in your hair at least 5 minutes! I put a cut off valve on my shower head so I don&#x27;t waste so much water! Bill</li>
    <li> this product is on the pricey side for sure, but it definitely does make a difference. i had been noticing excessive shedding and my hair going from very thick too pretty thin over the last year. i have tried the less expensive options to no success. now i am shedding much less hair and have noticed a lot of new growth. i am also on supplements, but i notice a difference in shedding when i switch to another shampoo. will keep using. i just wish the price were better or if they could offer a deal if you bought in bulk, purchased monthly or something though.</li>
    <li> I use this product to help with dry scalp and dandruff issues. The shampoo is very effective. I notice a difference after just two applications. It also leaves my hair shiny and soft. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> Most products are for dandruff caused by dry scalp.  I have dandruff and itchiness caused from oily scalp.  So I&#x27;m looking for a product that will remove all the residue from my scalp.  I use the fingernail test.  After showering, does lightly scratching my scalp leave film under my fingernail?  This does, hence the 1 star review.  It doesn&#x27;t clean residue from my scalp and is therefore a fail, an expensive one at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many brands and the only thing that has come close is Theraneem, but even that stops working after I use for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> The Product is ok. I was just surprise its very small for the price I paid for it. I have not seen any effect yet, but I guess its better than NIOXIN products which causes losing my hair. I hope I can recover from that experience. For all of you who has thinning hair like me, try also Pantene for fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried similar product in the past and have been disappointed.     I recently started using Regenepure and I really believe it is working. Even my fiancé says my hair looks better and is more full. I use it every day, and in addition to the hair loss benefits, it is an excellent every day shampoo.     I try to eat natural and healthy and I like the fact that this shampoo is also made from all-natural ingredients.     Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> Used this shampoo and it&#x27;s not much better than any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve used except it leaves your scalp feeling minty which is somewhat of a refreshing feeling.Would give this product a 5 but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel much different even an hour after washing it with this,just can&#x27;t see or feel the results as other reviews have had.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenepure Dr. and NT for the past 6 months which is enough time to give these a review. My hair and scalp used to be dry and filled with dandruff, this stuff has been a lifesaver, after using my hair and scalp feels clean, light and moisturized. It&#x27;s safe to use everyday but I only use it twice a week to make it last (Both bottles usually last me about 2 months, though the NT usually runs out quickly). I purchase them directly from their website that way I can get them from a new lot. As a previous reviewer mention the labels are confusing as they state to follow up with one of the other but I think that&#x27;s someone&#x27;s fault from the manufacturer. Use DR.(shampoo) first then follow up with NT (conditioner).    Also these are suppose to make your hair look/feel thicker but I didn&#x27;t get those results.    As of now I&#x27;m including DermOrganic shampoo to my regimen to make Regenepure last longer since it&#x27;s freaking expensive. Overall I recommend this shampoo. I gave it four stars because it&#x27;s expensive and my latest Dr. bottle was not full.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a month now and it has not done anything about the flakes, itchiness and hair loss. I have tried many shampoos to solve my issue and some of them have worked in less than 10 days, the problem it´s that as soon as I stop using them the problem appears again, but with this shampoo nothing got better. I am really disappointed.</li>
    <li> I am battling PCOS and wanted a shampoo that could possibly help my hair loss. I read a lot of positive reviews on this and decided to give it a try. I have used one bottle and I haven&#x27;t seen a huge change, but my hair has fallen out a little less since I started (no hair regrowth though), so I&#x27;m hoping it helps, but can&#x27;t tell you honestly that it&#x27;s a 100% cure. I do love the fresh minty smell and I love at least having something (though it&#x27;s not huge) helping me during this battle.</li>
    <li> First of all the directions are unclear...Both the DR and NT bottles say follow with the other product. The DR says follow with the NT and vice versa. So what is the correct way?  The products made my hair worse not better and gave me more dandruff. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is great, I&#x27;ve only been using it every other day for about 2 weeks and the dandruff is actually gone. I&#x27;ve also asked friends if they&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is thicker and all commented yes, can&#x27;t wait to see more results as I continue using. Must buy if you have dandruff and thinning hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about three weeks now and I am a little disappointed because it only improved itching slightly. Also, based on other reviews I thought that less of my hair would be falling out but this is not the case. I gave it 3 stars because I was expecting better results based on the price and reviews from other users. However, it is possible that three weeks is not long enough to see the results.</li>
    <li> Because this shampoo claims to be anti-hairloss I have to give it only 2 stars. I used it for three months with no change in my mildly thinning hair. Ketoconazole is the only ingredient in this shampoo that has medically been reported to reverse hair loss. However as far as I can tell this was only seen in one study and it only had an affect on one patient in this study out of all the test subjects.  Furthermore that study used a cream with twice the concentration of ketoconazole then in Regenapure. As a shampoo it is not bad and I would rate it higher if it didn&#x27;t claim to do something it does not and if it wasn&#x27;t priced so high because of this claim.</li>
    <li> EDIT: I see this is no longer advertised as a hair growth shampoo.  Go Figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this shampoo did make my hair look cosmetically thicker after use, the side effects were hardly worth it.  For one, it made my hair feel incredibly dry.  Even worse, my scalp itches like crazy a few minutes after I get out of the shower.  I switched to a different shampoo after I couldn&#x27;t bare the itchy feeling any longer, and itching went away.  This product might be for some, but don&#x27;t be fooled by the limited testimonials (some of which I suspect are fake).  Oh and it didn&#x27;t help grow my hair back, though I only used it for about two months &amp; something like Keta would obviously take longer to see noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: The 25 dollar cost and miniscule size of this bottle, not to mention cheap plastic make, arrived dented compels me to bump this down to 1 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for about 3 years now.  It works wonders for dandruff, and it seems to have slowed down my hair-loss, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve grown new hair.  You also don&#x27;t need conditioner when you use it.  I even tried Nioxin because it was cheaper and ranked well, but with the Nioxin, my hair was falling out like crazy.  Even though Regenepure is a little spendy, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis and I saw the results on my scalp after using this shampoo for one time. This shampoo is making my seborrheic dermatitis to disappear, however I know that this is as long as I am using the shampoo (that&#x27;s how seborrheic dermatitis is and you should deal with it your whole life)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this shampoo because when I use it it gives such a nice, cool and fresh feeling to my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this shampoo is SLS free and paraben free. This is a shampoo I will purchase again for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have hair loss, so I cannot give any opinion on how this shampoo affect hair loss.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Have had good results.  Would purchase again anytime from this seller.</li>
    <li> I had been struggling for awhile with scalp issues. A couple of years ago, I stopped using sulfate shampoos and the results were fantastic - for my hair.  It went from a dry, frizzy, coarse, puffball to almost \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair. I discovered that I actually had nice waves, and it got much softer and smoother. But my scalp was another story. I had always had a few mild patches of seborrheic dermatitis along my hairline - but now I was getting lots of flakes all over my scalp. I couldn&#x27;t figure out if I had dandruff or dry scalp (I think I had both). Washing with dandruff shampoo helped with the flake but ruined my hair. Then I found Regenpure DR and after one wash, my scalp seemed better. Now, after a few uses, I haven&#x27;t had a single flake, and my hair looks great too. I don&#x27;t use the NT afterwards like they suggest - I just use a regular hair conditioner, without which it would definitely be too dry. It still works great for me using it that way. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain parabens and other bad chemicals.  I took off one star just because it&#x27;s so expensive, and you have to use quite a lot of product to cover your scalp.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nizoral but soon learned that it and most other shampoos contain SLS. I switched to Regenepure DR and I was amazed. Not only does this shampoo contain Keto but also a list of other natural ingredients which combat hair loss and thinning hair. Combined with Regenepure NT I feel these two shampoos are a great addition to any regemen for thinning hair or just someone who wants to improve their overall scalp and hair health. Thanks Regenepure!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product as part of my thinning hair protocol. I switch between Regenepure and Nizoral shampoo and use Rogaine twice daily and have good results. This product leaves your hair feeling clean and thicker. Upon application it has a tingly sensation that you can feel penetrating your scalp. It doesnt lather up as well as the Nizoral and leaves your hair a bit dry. it just takes a little bit more in the palm of your hand to get it to lather better and a good conditioner to relief the dryness. I will keep a bottle in my rotation.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair feel good not sure about growth because it will take more than a few weeks.</li>
    <li> cannot see any difference in hair volume</li>
    <li> I have used Regenepure NT and DR for over a month now.  Here are the benefits:    1) my hair absolutely feels stronger and thicker (hasn&#x27;t felt like this in YEARS)  2) my hair feels CLEANER  3) my hair loss has subsided (though I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s because of the shampoo or something else).    The negative I had... and this is a BIG negative for me... is that it caused my seborrheic dermatitis to rage out of control.  I&#x27;ve had the worst case of it I&#x27;ve had in a year.  Again, this maybe coincidental as my dermatitis is often caused by outside factors like stress, lack of exercise/sleep, etc.  The odd thing is that the ONLY thing that gets rid of my dermatitis is ketoconazole, which is IN the shampoo.  However, only prescription 2% gets rid of it.  My only fear in using this shampoo is that I will develop a resistance to the efficacy of ketoconazole over time and then I&#x27;ll be really screwed!      My seb derm is going away by cycling in 2% keto.  I just ordered more DR and NT because overall, I feel it&#x27;s worth it.  My hair looks great.  However, if my dermatitis comes back, I may consider discontinuing.</li>
    <li> worked for a little bit but my scalp gets flaky again if i stop using it...</li>
    <li> Embarassing to say, but over the past five years as my allergies worsened so did my scalp.  I had gotten to the point that not only did I have extremely oily hair I started to get dandruff that got progressively worse over time until I had awful itching and huge flakes in my hair.  I tried Head &amp; Shoulders, and then switched to T-Gel, and then to clinical T-Gel, all with absolutely no resolution.  I also have colored hair and these products caused fading.  Since they didn&#x27;t work anyway I just thought I had to suffer and started using a Sulfate free shampoo so at least my color would last longer but the itching and scalp buildup finally got the best of me. I started thinking maybe I could find a Sulfate free shampoo that would stop this severe dandruff and found Regenepure DR.  I decided to give it a try.  It took three seperate washings until I my scalp was completely free of the severe dandruff, but it totally cleared my scalp up.  I no longer itch at all, even if I go 4 days without washing my hair.  It still gets oily as all get out by the third day, but serioulsy not one flake or the even the tiniest bit of itching.  Even though I have a very thick head of hair and wasn&#x27;t looking to prevent hair loss, I have noticed about 50% less hair in the drain after I wash than I used to experience before using Regenepure DR.  I follow the directions and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing and it leaves my scalp feeling fresh.  This stuff is very expensive, and I thought I used expensive sulfate stuff to begin with, but I have found a thrifty way to make the investment not so painful.  I first thoroughly wash all my hair with my regular sulfate free shampoo, because I can be a bit more liberal with it.  Then I rinse and use about a quarter sized amount to just scrub into my scalp, that way I am not wasting this very expensive shampoo washing my hair too. The bottle should last alot longer doing it that way. I highly recommend this shampoo since it is the ONLY one that I have used for dandruff that worked.at I have used for dandruff that worked.</li>
    <li> While this is probably the most I have ever paid for a shampoo excluding prescription shampoos, this is simply the best there is for dandruff and flaking. My dull hair is now shiny and full and my dandruff which was severe is gone, no more itching, no flakes, red spots are gone. I can wear black without worrying! I only bought it 2 weeks ago! This is the best product for dandruff and even if I didn&#x27;t have dandruff I would still use it. I have tried perhaps 20 different dandruff shampoos and none worked and made my hair look as good like this. While it is not cheap, it really does the job. Even on my eyebrows(be careful) it cleared up the flaking. You really do get what you paid for with this stuff!</li>
    <li> My doctor told me that too much exposure to Ketoconazole (the main ingredient) can lead to liver damage. Just be aware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working. If it is, not enough evidence to warrant buying this product. Maybe I need to use it longer?</li>
    <li> I &#x27;think&#x27; I am seeing results, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure. It wasn&#x27;t as noticeable as when I used Nizoral, but I bought Regenepure since it has gentler ingredients. I&#x27;ll keep at it and update this review soon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about two months.  It has been soothing to my scalp and has cleaned up any trace of dandruff.  When I feel my scalp, there are a lot of small hairs growing back in.  Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to have done anything for my receding hairline.  Lol.  It&#x27;s a good shampoo, but very expensive.  Fortunately, I keep my hair short, so a bottle lasts me about two months.</li>
    <li> I have tried every over the counter product shampoo and the past year started looking into sulfate free shampoos.    I happen to have a serious case of scalp psoriasis that I have used rx cream in the past for but currently uninsured.    Searching on Amazon I found this with all the great reviews, I was excited, but honestly I have not noticed a huge difference.  There is a mild tingling sensation when you leave it on for a while, it feels gentle enough, the smell is pleasant, but my scalp condition is pretty much the same.  And I definitely have not noticed any improvement with my hair shedding at all.  I wasted 25 bucks on this and I will never EVER pay that much for a shampoo again.    I do think this may be a good option for people with milder dandruff or scalp psoriasis.    Even then, I still feel there are cheaper options that are just as effective.  I am currently using KeraCare Dry &amp; Itchy Scalp Moisturizing Shampoo and Nioxin Scalp Recovery which both work better than this and cost less.    Like I said, when it comes to Health and Beauty products, it&#x27;s not a one size fits all. Everyone has a different scalp with different issues, so products will have different effects on people.</li>
    <li> In total I am using it for more than 2 years. This is great shampoo for scalp treatment, really one of the best out of the ones I used (including Nizoral and T-gel). I typically apply it twice a week. Sometimes I would put a regular shampoo on my hair first time, wash it out and then apply Regenepure. Can&#x27;t comment anything on the hair loss problem but it fights dandruff really well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been day three and there is little result. I didn&#x27;t realize until it was too late that this product only contains 1% ketoconazole and if you want real results as far a getting rid of dandruff you need a 2% shampoo. I usually get Nizoral 2% or a generic version of it but it usually requires a prescription to get it. If your lucky you can find it online without a prescription. I will update my review by 8/2/13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******UPDATE*******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to wait until Friday but since I&#x27;m here I&#x27;ll go ahead and give feedback. As I mentioned before, the results were minimal. As of today, it appears that I don&#x27;t have much flaking but I rode my bike to work and was busy all day so the sweat pretty much kept my head from drying which is why I think there wasn&#x27;t any flaking. If you want results to help with dandruff, dermatitis or psoriasis of the scalp I would recommend Nizoral 2% or a generic version of it. On your first time using Nizoral you may experience hair loss due do removal of plaque on the scalp which also may build up in the follicles which is what keeps some of the hair from falling out. But trust me, don&#x27;t freak out you&#x27;ll be alright. I use to get it on my eye brows as well. Nizoral 2% cleared that up. In fact, I would apply some of the suds on my face and on my ears. Basically its for fungus on the surface of your skin. I hope this help some of you with your purchase decision.</li>
    <li> my hair looks good, have to wait more to see if it works</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 3 weeks now. It does make the hair feels thicker after just a few uses. It cleans well also as a shampoo, hence no worries in using this as a long term shampoo. As far as stopping hair loss or stimulating new hair growth, it is difficult to tell at this time. Perhaps after few months of uses, a verdict is possible and hopefully a positive one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because it contains ketaconazole. I used Nizoral until I could no longer find it and scoured the internet for a replacement. I don&#x27;t have thinning hair or significant dandruff. What I do have is recurring tinea versicolor. Other OTC products just treat symptoms, but Regenepure actually solves the problem. As a bonus, my hair hasn&#x27;t been so soft and healthy in a very long time. It is pricey but well worth it for the results.</li>
    <li> I used to use Nizoral shampoo for 3 years and was happy with it. After it got disappeared from market I started to use this shampoo. I combined it with regenpure NT. It didn&#x27;t work for me at all. It didn&#x27;t help my hair loss I sometimes think may be it made it worse, and my hairs become thinner and thinner. I do not suggest it at all.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about a month. Helps with my dermatitis but doesn&#x27;t stop my hair from falling out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost a month. It seems like nothing has changed because my hair is still somewhat thin. I suppose I wasted 25$, but I will continue to use it and see is there going to be changes.</li>
    <li> Give it time to work. It took about a month and a half to two months for me to start seeing results. Be patient. Shampoo is very drying, so purchase conditioner with it. My hair loss due to PCOS has diminished.</li>
    <li> This stuff contains ketoconazole, an anti-fungal.  Jog itch is generally fungal in origin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything for years, for jog itch, and none of it worked. The most common prescription ointment didn&#x27;t work, and those over the counter aerosol sprays didn&#x27;t work.  It was an \\&quot;oh, happy day\\&quot; moment when I found this stuff.  If you have chronic jog itch, you know what I&#x27;m talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other products that contain ketoconazole, but this product, when used as a light ointment really does the job with a minimum of fragrance and mess.  Use it PRN.  A little dab will do ya&#x27;, so the 8 ounces will last a long time.  Some of the other anti-fungal products come in teeny weeny tubes.  We need for our Washington, DC politicians to pass a law against teeny weeny tubes of anything.  I found this product to be the most economical and most convenient method.  I didn&#x27;t have to use my vise grips to get the product out of a teeny weeny tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m aware that \\&quot;jog itch\\&quot; is not the common name for the ailment.  Spelling correction is not requested or required on this review or any other review.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Works great to improve the  condition of hair and decreases hair loss. I have recommended this product to family and friends.</li>
    <li> i thought amazon is responsible for providing authentic profile. the shampoo that I received like many others did have a different color cap and I don&#x27;t assume it was the original product. If, on ther hand, it was the original  product, I should say that I don&#x27;t recommend it at all. I never felt any improvement, whatsoever, in my hair. it was more coarse than ever and the hair loss was worse as well. I even started to feel some itchy spots across my scalp. after two pr three times I just quit using it and now I am just back to an ordinary shampoo which I bought for 6 bucks and works way better than this rather expensive shampoo. overall, I definitely do not recommend this product to anyone as I believe it is a waste of money. I believe I just trusted Amazon way too much.</li>
    <li> Contrary to everyone&#x27;s reviews, this product caused significant hair loss immediately after use.  I used them 3 times and every time was worse.  In the shower, toweling and brushing my hair (after I applied leave-in conditioner) was very disappointing because of all the hair that was coming out.</li>
    <li> it helps keep the hair from further thinning.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because it contains ketoconazole, and I hoped that since Nizoral was unavailable it would make a good substitute. It did not help with my dandruff, and I must look elsewhere. While I think its an ok shampoo, it fails at what I purchased it for.</li>
    <li> its a good shampoo it works slowly but starts working after a month</li>
    <li> Like the product, hate the price. It&#x27;s a bit pricey. The product doesn&#x27;t lather as well as you would expect but most natural products don&#x27;t lather well. I think this product works really good because you can feel the difference after using it. I&#x27;ve tried products from Nioxin, Murad and a few others and I like Regenepure the best. Truthfully though, don&#x27;t expect these products to grow you a full head of hair if you are going bald. Most likely, it&#x27;s genetic and you can do very little. You can probably slow down the hormones in your body that is causing your hair to fall out by taking drugs such as Proscar but that&#x27;s about it. These shampoo are meant to be a natural alternative and help to naturally nourish your scalp and hair. I think the price is a bit high especially compared to its competitors.</li>
    <li> No complaints, no massive amounts of hair but leaves a nice clean feeling and if it&#x27;s keeping down the DHT, that&#x27;s a bonus.</li>
    <li> Too early to see if it helps with hairloss. I love the way it leaves my scalp feeling cooled like I washed my hair with peppermint. I also may not be a good candidate to test for hair loss, as mine is pretty minimal.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo.  It is expensive, but a little goes a long way.  You don&#x27;t need to use much at all.  Once you get it into your wet hair, it suds up and spreads easily.  I like the non-sulfate shampoos.  They keep my hair color from fading.  Sulfate shampoos fade the hair color and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo.  It&#x27;s mild: nowhere near as harsh as the Head and Shoulders I used to use.  Plus I have no dandruff flakes at all with this shampoo: H&amp;S never totally fixed my dandruff but this stuff does.  I haven&#x27;t seen any \\&quot;volumizing\\&quot; effects after using the product a few weeks but that&#x27;s OK with me.  I may be imagining things but it does seem to have halted or slowed the mild thinning I currently have on the top of the scalp even if it doesn&#x27;t reverse it or bring any back: didn&#x27;t really expect that anyway.  I think a mild shampoo helps, plus no more itchy scalp either!</li>
    <li> During my finals, I always lose a ton of hair due to stress and it takes so long to grow back in.  I also have a horrible scalp and tinea versicolor on my stomach and sides.  The Regenepure DR has proven to be excellent.  I no longer see masses of hair falling out when I shower AND I can use the shampoo on my stomach to keep the tinea versicolor from flaring up.  Although it is a bit pricy, I am using the duo (DR and NT) and so long as I continue to get these results, I&#x27;ll be budgeting to buy this shampoo!</li>
    <li> Regenepure is worth the money! I receive this item to review and i am telling the truth about it. with me it relieved my scalp from being itchiness and scalp flakes. i have not used it long enough to know if it works for hair loss but everything i experienced with it is positive. i have tried lots of shampoos for flakes and itchiness at my local store and all of them just sucked. I decided to try this out and when i run out i am going to invest my $25 in more. dont go on by what i say though you will just have to try it out yourself.</li>
    <li> My hair felt weighed-down after using the Regenepure.  I felt like it left junk in my hair.  I had to use my other shampoo to rinse it out.  The fragrance is so strong it knocks you out.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products to help with my scalp and even the prescription medications have not helped like this product!  After 3 uses I have no more build up and very little flakes.  I&#x27;m now ordering it for my brother.  Very much worth the $25 I spent for the relief I have experienced.  I have long, thick hair so I use Regenpure on my scalp and massage it in.  Then I use my other shampoo on my ends to use less Regenpure.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle of this shampoo.  I really like that it makes my hair fuller.  I just recently bought the Biotin conditioner from Regenepure too.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> This shampoo was pretty good. But i didnt get immediate results like some people say. In fact, the first night i used it, my scalp felt itchier than ever!!! But, after a few washes, I did see some improvement in the dryness of my scalp. I followed other people&#x27;s advice and would wash my hair first with my regular shampoo, then apply a small amount of the Regenepure to just my scalp. This shampoo is pricey so I didn&#x27;t want to waste it just trying to clean my hair. It has a nice minty smell and it feels soothing when you put it on. BUT, it does leave the hair feeling kind of dry afterwards. I have to say, as a woman with long hair, I usually see a lot of strands of hair come out when I wash, but not with this shampoo. So that&#x27;s an added plus. This product did not cure the dryness, but it did help significantly. If it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, I&#x27;d probably buy this on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> i bought two 16 0z bottles becuase the temples were losing hair,  it everything else feels thicker, but my receding hairl line looks like its running from my face, its pissing me off, its been over three months going on four,  not for my hair type wich is thick mexican hair just the front is receding, im going to copy this and paste it on a five star so more people see this on both sides of the rating</li>
    <li> best shampoo on the market and reasonable price, but tbh there is no such thing as regrowing hair unless with surgery, so don&#x27;t by this if your a dude with male pattern baldness and expect it to revert you hair back to when you were like 16.  but it is really good tho.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the bottom line as far as I&#x27;m concerned: the product advertised itself as a shampoo/conditioner that would \\&quot;make the hair look and feel thicker\\&quot;, \\&quot;provide the ultimate skin treatment for the scalp\\&quot; and produce \\&quot;healthier, fuller results with just one application.\\&quot; Well, folks, it just isn&#x27;t so. While I can&#x27;t question the advocacy for the product of those who have given it raving reviews, I can relate that it did nothing of the kind for me.     What you have with this product is a small bottle of thick, greenish shampoo that does not lather well unless you apply a generous portion. Now, I honestly didn&#x27;t expect it to lather much given the ingredients. What I did expect was that the end result would be hair that no longer appeared dry and damaged but that was not what I experienced. As for thickening the hair, I sincerely think we&#x27;re fooling ourselves and in all probability because we so desperately want the shampoo to do this. It doesn&#x27;t.     After using this shampoo for a few weeks I will say that my hair is no worse and no better than before I began the treatment. I&#x27;ve asked my wife for her opinion and it mirrors my own. It&#x27;s thick shampoo and that&#x27;s about all I can say for it. It isn&#x27;t a miracle elixir but then for $25 I fully expected it was a shot in the dark and I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. So, I have a relatively expensive half bottle of shampoo left that I will finish and not renew. I think there are far better but less convenient ways of treating dry hair and dandruff than using products such as this. For those for whom the shampoo worked wonders: congratulations. For the rest of us: live and learn.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for more than 2 weeks now together with the Regenepure NT but it seems that I&#x27;m shedding even more hair and now it&#x27;s thinning a lot. I&#x27;m taking it that all the weak hair are dropping off now to make place for the strong ones. I hope to see a different result after 6 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I use this for dandruff. It takes a few months to see results but it definitely works—I had very severe dandruff with huge noticeable flakes. Now a couple years later, no flakes or pimples or scabs on my scalp and very little itchiness. More gentle to my coarse, wavy, color-treated hair than prescription and over-the-counter dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used. I only use it twice a week at most. Has a nice minty scent and cooling tingly feeling when applied to the scalp.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best shampoo i have ever used. It thoroughly clean the scalp. As far as hair regrowth is concerned, i can&#x27;t comment on that but it definitely reduce the hair fall.</li>
    <li> Regenepure DR worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the years, I tried many different things from anti-dandruff shampoos and home remedies to medications, and none of them worked. I&#x27;ve had a pretty severe case of seborrhoeic dermatitis. I can&#x27;t count the nights that I would be lying in bed, unable to sleep because my scalp and face itched so bad that it became a constant throbbing and burning. I would stay up late just being miserable and scratching, which would leave my bed littered with white flakes. My hairline, ears, eyebrows and nose would be covered in white flaky skin, which people would notice, and it made me very self-conscious. My hairline was even thinning in the itchy areas, partially from being covered in white flakes and partially from me itching those spots constantly. I felt like if it didn&#x27;t go away soon, I would be bald.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I started doing some research on the internet and I found out about ketoconazole. People were saying that this stuff really works. So then I started looking for shampoos with ketoconazole as an ingredient, and I found Regenepure and Nizoral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nizoral is really hard to find, and when you do find it overseas somewhere, expect to pay A LOT of money for a MUCH smaller bottle. I know this because I actually bought a bottle at the same time I bought Regenepure, but I never even used Nizoral because I had no reason to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenepure DR has ketoconazole and it&#x27;s far less expensive. One of the first things I noticed was that my ears no longer had flaky skin, and after a couple weeks my scalp no longer itched, there were no flakes in my bed, and my nose (although scarred from years of irritation) is a lot better. I even apply a small amount to my nose whenever I shower. My days of being miserable and itchy are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and it definitely changed my life. If you have seborrhoeic dermatitis or a severe case of itchy scalp, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this product!</li>
    <li> This shampoo works very well for dandruff control. Maybe it might promote hair growth, its tough to judge. It s bit costly.</li>
    <li> I loved using this shampoo at first but now its not working like it use to. Which is alittle disappointing considering that you pay so much for so little, and the little bit I got isn&#x27;t working anymore. Maybe its just me. I have this problem with most shampoos I&#x27;ve used. Great at first then dull and straw like.</li>
    <li> useless.  Bough whole line.  Hair looks greasy on end of day</li>
    <li> I think this may work for some people but not for everyone. I don&#x27;t think my hair stopped losing after using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had seborrheic dermatitis for a decade, and this shampoo has completely cleared it up. My shedding has also been cut in half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have curly hair, this doesn&#x27;t harm my 3b curls or make them frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--ketoconazole clears up seborrheic dermatitis and decreases shedding&lt;br /&gt;--no SLS or parabens&lt;br /&gt;--great for curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;--customer service: I purchased this product on the Regenepure website and wanted to write a review in order to get $20 off my next purchase. After exchanging emails with one of their customer service reps, I was told that I was ineligible for the coupon because I hadn&#x27;t purchased the product through Amazon.</li>
    <li> Not sure what it does for hairloss (although ketoconazole does have medical studies on it), but as a person with a bald family I started this shampoo about a year ago and I have the best hair in my family by far. Could just be that the genetics aren&#x27;t there for me, but there was some slight temple recession that hasn&#x27;t progressed. I actually like it for the ingredients and the fact that it stopped my dandruff and keeps my hair feeling healthy, so its worth it for that alone. We&#x27;ll see in the future if it slows down hairloss, Im too young and its too early to tell for sure.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Regenepure hair shampoo to prevent hair loss.  Shortly after using it -I started to read negative reviews online.  Apparently its not all its cracked up to be.  I myself saw no improvement - too bad, I was hoping to find something that works.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well for me, so I&#x27;m going to try it in conjunction with the NT shampoo and maybe the conditioner to see if it works with even better results.</li>
    <li> Not sure about all the reviews for this stopping hair loss, but I can comment on the quality of the shampoo. Since the first time I tried it, until today I am always astounded with how fresh my scalp feels throughout the entire day. It also makes my hair more full and manageable. It is a great shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 1 Apr 2014: Been using this shampoo for about 3 weeks now. I alternate it with Millcreek Biotin shampoo. I use the Regenepure Dr for 2 days, then on the 3rd day I use the biotin shampoo. Since adding this shampoo to my regimen my fallout has dramatically decreased and when I say dramatically, I say I am seeing about 95% less fallout that I was before. Before, after getting out of the shower, I would shake my hair into the bathroom sink, there would be 40 to 50, sometimes more hair in the sink. Now when I shake my hair, there are 5 to 7 hairs in the sink and there have been a few days recently where there was 3 or 4 hairs in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing this has improved my confidence greatly! Last Sunday I went to see my barber, the same guy cutting my hair every 2 weeks for the last 5 years. A couple months ago, I noticed he didn&#x27;t cut any hair from the top of my scalp. I asked him about it and he said, it hadn&#x27;t grown and was still too short to cut. I asked him to trim it anyway. My hair growth was slowing, this was nauseating. So this last Sunday (2 days ago), I went to the same barber. As he cut my hair he said \\&quot;Your hair is growing very fast, this is almost like 1 month of growth\\&quot; and it had only been 2 weeks! I have used the Millcreek biotin shampoo, biotin tablets and lipogaine at night for the last 3 months; the only thing I changed was I added the Regenepure Dr shampoo to my regimen and literally 3 weeks later, 2 tangible results: 1. Reduced hair loss 2. Hair grows must faster (this is important as it indicates healthy follicles)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t pay enough super close attention to my scalp to tell you that I have new growth (I still have sufficient hair that it covers the thin areas if groomed properly), but I can tell you that my scalp is SUPER clean, no more itching (completely gone), much fuller hair, fallout greatly reduced and fast growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies and Gentlemen: this product works!</li>
    <li> I like the smell as far as hair growth can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> hard to see any difference...will try second bottle...just to see and give it a decent chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe bald is beautiful afterall</li>
    <li> My scalp tends to get flaky during the dry winter months.  Have tried the common brands that local stores carry but they either were not very affective or they smelled pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very pleased with the results from Regenepure DR. Not only did it make my dandruff disappear after only a few uses, but it also smells really nice.  I can&#x27;t say if it has done anything to give me a fuller head of hair but since I already have a thick, full mane, I&#x27;m not concerned/interested in that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fairly expensive shampoo (although worth it). Once my dandruff is under control, I only use it occasionally for maintenance.  With my long thick hair, I find it lathers better when I shampoo a 2nd time around.  So I use a cheaper shampoo for the first round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This should not be confused with the cheaper NT version.  Not sure what that one is supposed to do but I bought it by mistake and it did nothing to help with dandruff.</li>
    <li> I always have been a user of cheap generic shampoos.  I have scalp issues like dandruff and very fine hair.  I tried this shampoo as I am in my mid 40s and starting to lose my hair.  I use it in conjunction with the Kirkland Minoxidyl 5%.  I have been using for about a week and I have to say that my hair has not ever been better.  Has alot of body and feels much fuller.  I little goes a long way when applying.  I does not lather at all like most shampoos.  I put it on and let it sit for 5 minutes then rinse.  I only wash once and I dont use the NT like the label says.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with various hair loss shampoos and this doesn&#x27;t stack up to some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I can&#x27;t say as to if it stops or slows down hair loss but i don&#x27;t like the way it feels going on.  Lipogaine Big 3 shampoo has similar ingredients and feels better going on as far as something with Ketoconazole.  I preferred Nizoral as well; especially the way it made my hair look.  But I bought this trying to get away from the sodium laurel sulfate thing.</li>
    <li> Awesome smell and texture. Very Happy!</li>
    <li> Switched to Regenepure when I noticed Nioxin product line seemed to have changed.  I&#x27;ve been using for a few months now and I like the product.  While I don&#x27;t notice additional regrowth, it did slow the thinning down and the quality is great.  I just reordered and plan to continue using - best quality to price option I could find.</li>
    <li> Update:  I&#x27;ve used products for about 2 years...still great! I had been having trouble with itchy, flaking scalp.  My hair was falling out quite a bit as well.  I was online looking for help and stumbled on this product and Regenepure NT.  I purchased both and have used them together and separately for about 3 months now.  I noticed a difference in the itchiness and definetly in the flaking of my scalp.  For me they are both great![[ASIN:B0032FQSZG Regenepure NT (Nourishing Treatment) Scalp Cleanser Anti-hair Loss Shampoo]]</li>
    <li> Turns my hair into a brillo pad! I have/had a ton of naturally curly hair which tends to be dry and unruly to begin with. I give up:(</li>
    <li> I just started using this shampoo last month &amp; so far I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement in my hair.  My hair isn&#x27;t any fuller or new growth.  I hope I see some improvements soon considering how expensive this is.  The only positive thing about this is it smells wonderful but I don&#x27;t really care about the smell if it doesn&#x27;t help my hair like they claim.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has a condition which contributed to her hair thinning and I am graying which is leading to more flyaway, unruly hair.  Regenepure has been great for both of us.  Within a week my daughter had some new growth and my hair was noticeably thicker!</li>
    <li> It won&#x27;t do anything exceptional and undo genetic hair loss, but it does seem to at least slightly help slow things down. I also have had a somewhat itchy scalp, and it does help a bit with that as well. For what it is for, it helps, but will not give you any dramatic results. I&#x27;m not sure why, but I actually saw somewhat better results from the Regenepure NT which is actually the more cost efficient option.</li>
    <li> This is working very well. I have thin hair and it is becoming fuller and very soft. Great smell. I use it every other day and it does not dry out my hair or scalp.</li>
    <li> after washing my hair it feels like die hair, very hard and difficult to comb...terrible...&lt;br /&gt;I have to use a lot of conditioner to untangle it. It feel just like washing the hair with a clarifying shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Taking care of my scalp shouldn&#x27;t means to ruin my hair ..&lt;br /&gt;For a very greasy hair it may work, but for my hair it did not at all...I HATE IT.</li>
    <li> You might have an allergy. Try a gluten free shampoo instead of a DHT or regrow system. Saw Palmeto Anti DHT. Most shampoos, conditioners have wheat or a wheat derivative of wheat, barely or oats in them. This company dose use the direct words but does use derivatives. 1 in 30 people are allergic to that, either by consumption or on the skin. Hair loss is an EVENtual bi-product of this. Celiac is only detected if tested and only by 40 -50 % Then Gluten Allergies externally are for some reason catergorized differently than celiac because thats only related to the small intestinal tract. Im thinking Gluten is Gluten if your allergic its all over most likely. Anyhow, I have it and my hair is growing back after exhusting all avenues. Even my sun spots I was told was fungus which was alergic reaction to wheat is going away. P.S take minerals, iron, protein, wheat allergy deprives your body of these things you might have catching up to do. If you read up on celiac, it says weight loss, it also promotes weight gain however which is the most common, makes it hard to diet, around the mid section. You can find this on About.com</li>
    <li> I ordered the shampoo because a friend of mine used it for dandruff and said it was the only thing that had ever worked for him, so I thought it might work for my hair loss too, since that is one of its claims. Unfortunately, after two months of using both the DR and NT shampoos, I have not noticed a decrease in hair loss or an increase in new growth. It may be that the shampoo is not effective in treating the type of hair loss I have, but is for other types, since other reviews suggest that it does work for some people. Aside from this, the shampoo does leave my hair clean and the NT smells really good, but I have used other products that clean just as well (and also smell good) for a much lower price.</li>
    <li> Only been using for 2 months we shall see how well it works for thinning hair, smells good leaves hair kinda flat but just use a good conditionor after using this.. So far it&#x27;s a nice shampoo overall</li>
    <li> With Nizoral temporarily off the market (I&#x27;m told it&#x27;s due to an FDA relabeling thing), I needed a new shampoo for my sensitive scalp, so I decided to give this one a whirl.  Unfortunately, the combination of some things in this stuff, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the mint and the menthol, makes it smell like I&#x27;m washing my hair in smoker&#x27;s breath.    I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s doing anything for my scalp but using this product is not pleasant to me at all -- it smells innocently minty in the hand, but when you lather it up, pow, menthol smoker paradise.    Your hair *after* you&#x27;re done doesn&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;ve been smoking menthols (thank goodness).  I don&#x27;t see anyone else with this complaint so I&#x27;m not sure whether I&#x27;m just oversensitive, but man, it&#x27;s unignorable to me.  YMMV.</li>
    <li> I just used this for the first time and it not only made me itch all over, it made my hair fall out. It did not seem to dry my hair; that is the only good thing I noticed.</li>
    <li> First off, ignore all the people who say this makes hair fall out faster. What ANY hairloss product does is stimulate growth, and people see that as shedding the first week or so of use. So yes, You will see hair falling out, but there is hair growing in BEHIND that hair. If you see shedding, DO NOT STOP using the product, it is working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product and didn&#x27;t see significant growth until about a month. But it works, well. It effectively stopped my hair loss. In order for me to regrow hair, I had to use a different product, but I still use this product to keep the hair that I have. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, It is not a good shampoo in itself. It leaves hair flat and looking thinner than other products that use bleaches and lifteners to \\&quot;thicken\\&quot; your hair. I bought this shampoo not to give the appearance of thick hair, but to keep my already thinning hair. For that express purpose it works well. Better than all other products currently available that are topical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product, and use it for more than a month to make sure it works for you, it does for me!</li>
    <li> I discovered  Regenepure on regrowth.com and have been using the DR &amp; NT formulas since 2010  My hair was starting to thin and I was looking for a product to stop if not at least slow the hair loss.  I tried many products (still using minoxidil) with no success.   I took a chance w/ Regenepure based on the ingredients used in their products( both the DR &amp; NT solutions.)  Now almost 5 years later I still have hair but I think my hair loss is finally starting to catch up with me  Unfortunately since there is no cure for male pattern baldness but I believe Regenepure is helping me with keeping the hair I have now.  Also Regenepure’s Intense Volumizing Biotin Conditioner is a great addition as it has worked wonders for keeping my soft.(The DR &amp; NT formulas can slightly dry your hair)  I recommend all three of these Regenepure products DR, NT &amp;  Volumizing Biotin conditioner along with continuous usage of Minoxidil for maximum results  And even though my hair is really start to thin I will still use Regenepure when its finally gone because it will keep my scalp healthy.  The bonus is that bottles with last longer!!-lol</li>
    <li> This shampoo is either the first or second best in the market to aid with fighting hair loss. The bottle seemed small when I first bought it, but I bought mine four months ago, and use it 3-4 times a week and I&#x27;m only halfway done. I understand that since it&#x27;s only a shampoo, it&#x27;s effectiveness against stopping hair loss or promoting hair growth is limited, but it&#x27;s the best option for a shampoo. It leaves my hair and scalp feeling clean and cool. I would recommend this to people with hair-loss problems and even those without.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not thinking, nor have dandruff and I want to keep it that way.  So I bought a bottle of Regenpure DR and about 3/4 through the bottle I can say my hair looks and feels better.  It doesn&#x27;t over power on smell either.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have used two bottles of Regenepure DR so far, once every two or three days, leaving the shampoo on for at least three minutes before rinsing. Within a week or two, my dandruff disappeared and has not come back since. Initially, the shampoo created a refreshing tingling sensation on my scalp, but I no longer notice it. The smell is minty and slightly medicinal. No complaints there. Recently, after a few months of regular use, I&#x27;ve noticed what appear to be new hairs along my hairline. It&#x27;s a slow process, but I think it might be working. My hair also seems to feel thicker. On the downside, it is a little drying, and seems to change the texture of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $21, this is a decent deal for Americans, but importing the stuff to Canada with the current exchange rate is pretty expensive (over $35 CAD per bottle). If anyone knows where to buy this at a lower price in Canada, let me know! That said, I will continue to use it, sparingly, even at these prices.</li>
    <li> This product came early, and I am very satisfied with the quality and new look that the bottle has. I have been using this Regenepure for three years now and I wouldn&#x27;t switch it for any other shampoo. This shampoo takes away the oily scalp and reduces the DHT that my hair naturally produces. Overall this is a great product. You have to try it to understand the difference.</li>
    <li> Big fan if this brand. Will keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Rengenepure for 2 years now. I love it. My scalp is very dry and I used to get a burning sensation throughout the day. I started using Renegenepure DR everyday and the NT 3 times a week and I havent had an issue since. Also, I like that Rengenepure is paraben and sulfate free. No harsh chemicals!</li>
    <li> I’ve been using this product about a year now and I am well pleased. Much has been said about the use of harsh chemicals in shampoo so I decided to switch to a product that was both effective and healthier for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t have a hair loss issue but I do want to maintain a healthy scalp and prevent hair loss in the future if possible. I strongly feel this shampoo, based on its ingredients will help in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it regularly with luke warm/cool shower water and rinse with apple cider vinegar for best personal results. After usage my hair feels clean (I leave it on for 3-5 minutes) and looks full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with this product, will continue to use it, and recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I have dry, flaky scalp, AND color- and keratin-treated hair, so I have to use sulfate-free shampoo.  Unfortunately it is extremely difficult to find a dandruff shampoo that does not contain sulfates, so when I ran across Regenepure DR, I was very willing to try it.  This product is pricey, but it is worth every penny because it really works for me and does not harm my expensive salon treatments.  The shampoo makes my scalp feel fresh and tingly, and the eucalyptus scent is very nice.  I used it each time I shampooed for the first few weeks until the &amp;#34;snow&amp;#34; stopped falling.  I now use it once a week, which is enough to keep things in check.  I cannot speak to the hair thickening properties, as I have super-thick hair already, but if you need a sulfate-free shampoo to treat dandruff, this one is worth a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few weeks.  I tried it to reduce itching and hair shedding.  I like the way my hair feels after using it, but really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in itching or reduced shedding.  I think for the price, it&#x27;s not doing much.  I&#x27;ll use up the bottle, but probably won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I should have done more research. I tried this as an alternative to Nioxin. Now I am back with Nioxin and it works much better. This stuff is snake oil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and have had dandruff since I was 14. I&#x27;ve literally tried everything I could find, from prescrption shampoos to all of the over-the-counter remedies. Regenepure is the sole survivor. Knocks my dandruff out completely as long as I use it 2-3x/week. This is a stellar product.</li>
    <li> Regenepure has greatly helped with my dandruff and icky scalp issues. I was hesitant to invest this much on a bottle of shampoo, but it&#x27;s so worth the cost!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenepure DR for over a year now. I switched over from Nizoral as a hair loss treatment because Regenepure is gentler on my hair. Regenepure is sulfate free so it doesn&#x27;t lather much. However, I&#x27;ve found that a second application helps create more lather which leaves me feeling cleaner. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out. I used to get several bumps/pimples on my scalp and have noticed that using this shampoo has reduced their occurrence. It has anti inflammatory ingredients which may help prevent them. Overall I am satisfied with this shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a late 20&#x27;s male and like everyone here I had a bad scalp. It was itchy flakey and thinning.&lt;br /&gt;The stress from losing my hair was making me lose MORE hair... I tried nuhair which slowed the process&lt;br /&gt;and after getting everything, it added up to like 50 bucks in the long run. I didn&#x27;t bother with rogaine cause&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more of a natural healing type guy but the organic shampoos just felt like lotion or something, they&lt;br /&gt;lacked what my hair really needed. After all the reviews here I gave regenepure a shot and I have to say&lt;br /&gt;it gives my hair what it needs. I itch less, have less flakes, and fuller hair after less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY downside is the price, but hey you get what you pay for and this stuff is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I received this product for an honest review. I was loosing hair on the right side of my head and couldn&#x27;t find a reason. I had tried combing my hair 100 times to make it grow, taking prenatal vitamins, biotin and yes- even adding onions to my shampoo. However, nothing worked, my hair never grew longer than my shoulders and I was loosing it. I have really fine, dry, curly hair (all the wrong combinations) and to make matters worse, always had dandruff. I used this shampoo twice a week and noticed my hair shinier, healthier and growing back!! When I came back from having my ends trimmed, my husband commented on how long my hair was. Love it!</li>
    <li> Price: If the 2x 8oz is more than 2x the cost of just one, then buy just one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, that&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault, but the unscrupulous seller that thinks we&#x27;ll all do 16 oaz and pay more than twice the 8oz cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product itself:  I feel it&#x27;s been working for me in conjunction with monoxodil and my wife says my hair feels thicker and we both can see some coming back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s why you buy it, then buy it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product along with the biotin conditioner for about 2 months. My hair and scalp are feeling much healthier. I have not noticed much hair regrowth at this point but I am going to continue to use in conjunction with other regenepure products and report back a little further down the road.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t really work. I lost more hair while using it for 3 months. And while the way it left my hair actually was a good look for me (unlike some people&#x27;s opinions with the shampoo) and smells nice, it&#x27;s not worth the $25. Just get 2% leto shampoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m suffering through chronic telogen effluvium and have tried all sorts of shampoos to reduce hair loss.  Regenepure has helped as much as possible to do so - no other shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried has helped as much (including Nizoral and Nioxin). This is not a cure, by any means, but it keeps my scalp healthy and seems to reduce shedding during most of my shampooing.  I also take supplements that are good for hair growth, so I&#x27;m hoping that the combination of Regenepure and the supplements will continue to reduce the hair loss.  Yes, it&#x27;s very expensive for a shampoo, but I&#x27;m willing to pay the price as long as I feel that it continues to help.</li>
    <li> After I  use it, My hair loss isn&#x27;t relieved.&lt;br /&gt;It loses as much as before, but didn&#x27;t become more. ...........................</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  Great smell, lathers nicely, leaves my hair looking and feeling great. Much better alternative to other  harsher Ketoconazole shampoos!</li>
    <li> I have fairly severe seborrheic dermatitis, and for years nothing really worked, until I found Nizoral. Almost overnight the flaking started to disappear and the burning that would sometimes happen was gone. Not only did it treat that, but my hair seemed thicker too, so that was an unforeseen bonus. For whatever reason, OTC Nizoral has become increasing difficult to find, and what was available was basically being price-gouged by the sort of profiteering you generally see with whatever toys are popular at Christmas time. Thanks to those factors, I started looking for something to replace Nizoral, as the flaking started to come back as soon as I ran out of the stuff. That&#x27;s how I discovered Regenepure DR, and while Regenepure DR does certainly help with the flaking and still seems to thicken my hair, for me it&#x27;s just not as effective as the old standby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for what&#x27;s good about Regenepure DR, the minty scent is certainly pleasant, and I like the cooling effect that it has on my scalp. The ingredient list is also quite impressive, although I&#x27;m not sure how most of them are supposed to be good for your hair or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the bad, well, I guess it&#x27;s not so much bad as it is just not as good. As I stated before, while it definitely helps control the flaking from my dermatitis, it&#x27;s obviously not as effective as the Nizoral, which effectively eradicated it. The shampoo itself doesn&#x27;t seem to lather particularly well either, meaning I usually find myself applying it twice, which makes the price tag (which is effectively $10 more than the 7 ounce bottle of Nizoral 1%) a whole lot harder to swallow. It&#x27;s not that the Regenepure DR is bad stuff (it still does a far better job on my scalp than zinc or salicylic acid-only dandruff shampoos), it&#x27;s just a seriously obvious case of getting less for more.</li>
    <li> Optimism aside, after a year of regular use, I can safely say that this product does not work to restore any hair or prevent hair loss. My crown region has lost more hair since I ran out of my Ketoconazole 2% shampoo (which did a better job at maintaining the amount of hair I had remaining). The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the hair feels slightly thicker right after the shower. All in all an overpriced, ineffective hair loss remedy that needs to be reformulated or returned to the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> mini bottle should have paid more attention</li>
    <li> It caused serious dandruff and I had to visit doctor to get another prescribed shampoo.</li>
    <li> I purchased Regenpure DR as a preemptive defense against hair loss. It&#x27;s only been a week so I can&#x27;t speak to its impact on hair growth, but the state of my hair - dryness, weight -- has never been better. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> For a better understanding of my review, here a short description of my situation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 22 year-old German who has suffered from androgenic alopecia. To fight the hair loss, I have started using minoxidil three years ago.&lt;br /&gt;First, Minoxidil did work for me and my hairline almost fully recovered. One year ago, the effect of minoxidil diminished slightly and I decided to combine my minoxidil treatment with regenpure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been through a shedding-phase already when I first applied minoxidil, so I know about the importance of sticking to a hair loss preventing product and that shedding is actually a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn´t expect though is that the application of regenpure (three times a week) would actually &amp;#34;erase&amp;#34; all the hair gained by minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;I am applying the product for 6 months now (STILL using minoxidil) and my hair keeps falling out rapidly. The shedding still hasn´t stopped. Six months of shedding without visible gain seems like a lot of time to me and I am very disappointed since there was a lot of praise regarding this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My scalp, however, has never felt better and the itching caused by minoxidil has almost vanished completely. The ingredients of the shampoo are of a high qualitiy and it also smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue applying the shampoo, but I don´t expect the shampoo to work magic anymore. Since I´ve mainly bought the shampoo to fight hair loss, I will probably stop using the shampoo after I will have applied the whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phil</li>
    <li> I like this product. It works like a charm. I&#x27;m using this product more than 2 years now.&lt;br /&gt;It helped me to maintain my hair. It took a while though, initially I though this wouldn&#x27;t help me. But after couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a drastic improvement. The only complaint I have is, this product helps to maintain hair but doesn&#x27;t give hair a fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;For me it isn&#x27;t a concern, it&#x27;s helping me to maintain my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenepure for about 2 months and i have to say it works! My hair has stopped falling out and I&#x27;ve started see new growth</li>
    <li> Ok so I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product at first but I changed my mine quickly. My hair feels so much better. I definitely see an improvement. It&#x27;s got great ingredients and is good for your hair. It smells fresh and minty but is not too strong. It feels like I&#x27;m putting spa treatments in my hair. I have used it a few times now and it is wonderful. I love it. I did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions expressed in this post are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
    <li> The product really works to stop hair loss for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as I stated losing my hair. It stopped hair loss for sure if not it really slowed down. It makes my hair thicker also.</li>
    <li> This is a very good shampoo!</li>
    <li> its a great quality shampoo but it doesnt grow hair back. great anti-dandruff though. Again, nothing noticeable for hair loss</li>
    <li> I used this shampoo for about 4 months and did not see any difference be honest but i guess it is a good shampoo that i read good reviews. I probably wont buy it again because of the price of it, too expensive for the amount you get.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is absolutely nothing to stop my hair loss.  Do not waste your money on this.  Just shave your head.</li>
    <li> it does nothing for hair loss. I used it for about a year, saw no improvements at all. leaves the hair dry</li>
    <li> I started using this to control the extremely high dandruff caused by Nioxin and lipogaine. But everytime i use this shampoo, the hairloss is quite a bit. This kind of defeats the purpose why I was using the other two.</li>
    <li> Cooling Peppermint feel...Hair is softer, looks fuller! Wish it was a less expensive but the small bottle used every other day goes a long way....</li>
    <li> This shampoo is a hair &amp; scalp treatment that helps to restore, rejuvenate, and regenerate. It has a smell like peppermint, and gives that cold minty refreshing sensation while gently massaging into the scalp, compare to other clinical strength shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I notice some thinning and hair loss for the past 3 years, so we went on buying all sort of hair loss product and testing them for a period of a month. However, we never saw the results we have seen with this Luxury Hair Loss Shampoo. He has been using it for 4 weeks now and it has truly shown a good amount of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the benefits that my husband notice after using the product the first day, was how the dandruff and dry scalp ( causing it to itch ) has stopped and how soft it left his hair afterwards. He also said that it feels good on his scalp while massaging it and lathers very good as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this product to anybody that is experience hair thinning / loss. It gently cleanses away impurities and toxins while nourishing your scalp and roots. It can be used on all hair types as well, which it pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received this complimentary product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.***</li>
    <li> Been using for a month now. It smells fine and leave scalp tinglely. Don&#x27;t know about claims of it growing more hair but it definitely helps stop excess shedding of hair. My hair looks healthier too.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for me, after 8 months of use.  Nothing.  smells weird too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used other products, I would never pay the money for this one.  Not sure what the hype was, but someone told me that the active ingredient is at 1% in this, and in most products that work, its much higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly I did not like the smell...and the fact they said to leave it on for 5 minutes.  Made my fine hair very very brittle and dry.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo because I have been thinning on top quite aggressively for the past 2-3 years. I&#x27;ve only been using Regenpure shampoo for 2 months now (along with Lipogaine minoxidil), so it is too soon to say whether it has thickened my hair. However, it is a great shampoo that leaves my hair clean and deals with other problems associated with shedding. I no longer have any issues with dandruff and it leaves my scalp feeling clean and minty fresh. It&#x27;s not a great volumizing shampoo however, so I&#x27;ll probably use the other regenpure shampoo or their conditioner to supplement my regimen. I plan to post an update on my progress in a few months.</li>
    <li> I bought the Regenepure DR shampoo a few weeks ago after doing my research on the product. My shedding has increased over the last few months &amp; I’ve been looking for something to help. After using the shampoo treatment for a few days, I noticed an improvement &amp; was seeing fewer hairs in my shower. Now after almost two weeks I have a normal amount of shedding. The feeling it gives me when I massage it into my head is great. It leaves a light tingly feeling. I usually leave it in for 4 minutes. I found for me using it every other day works really well. I will definitely be using this as my go to hair loss shampoo.</li>
    <li> Keeps my scalp healthy.  Also safe for my colored hair.</li>
    <li> Smaller bottle than I anticipated.</li>
    <li> This is marketed as a product for thinning hair. I&#x27;m not sure if it has helped in that sense or not. However, I can say that it has been the best product for my dandruff that I have ever come across.</li>
    <li> I have reordered this multiple times.  it goes with the Nt.  Very happy with the product especially formulated for thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Good product, seems to work with scalp dermatological conditions, but can&#x27;t really say how well it works for hair loss. Smells good, and leaves scalp feeling clean. However, I&#x27;ve since stopped using this product, but my brother uses it frequently. Must be something he likes about it.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for over a year and am very pleased with the results. It controls hair loss and appears to have caused some regeneration or at the very least improved hair shaft thickness, length and thus the appearance of density. It&#x27;s ketoconazole helps prevent a reoccurence of scalp folliculitis that caused hair loss for me years ago. I had used Nizoral years ago before finding Regenepure DR. I find RegenePure DR has many other ingredients that are beneficial for the follicle and hair and is a superior product in the battle against hair loss.</li>
    <li> I ordered this stuff a few years ago and it&#x27;s truely amazing. First off, it has ketoconazole which I have never seen in a OTC (non-rx) shampoo. Normally I have to get the doctor to write an rx for this. The Rx shampoo is very basic and very drying on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenepure is soooo moisturizing on my hair but doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or anything. It contains aloe, so I&#x27;m sure these are the effects I am seeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff just leaves your hair feeling nourished and with a great texture. My hair also feels like it has more body. It gives it a feeling of being thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be ordering this again. You only need a little pea size amount of this also so it lasts a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a shampoo you want to start your shower with so it can sit on your scalp for at least 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the smell is lovely. A light mint smell with other essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I&#x27;m a 30 something year old guy who is thinning and losing his hair. I also use minoxidil and nioxin products.&lt;br /&gt;But this stuff as been a great addition to my regime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;peace!</li>
    <li> Been using if for years and I am the only male in my family, including my dad, who still has most of their hair.  I don&#x27;t know if it is genetics or this product that has allowed me to keep my fur, but I&#x27;m not messing with what&#x27;s working.  I will use this product until I don&#x27;t have enough hair to wash with it.</li>
    <li> I bought the combo . Regen NT/DR. I use it twice a week, not to overuse and cause any paradoxical effects. Almost 24 and widows peak horrible. But little hairs come in slowly but surely. Been using this product for a full year now.</li>
    <li> breaks up scalp sebum / sludge buildup... creates greater relaxation in the scalp and feels like it clears stagnancy (possibly DHT build-up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cleans very well and you can feel that it supports hair growth and stops recession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.  I&#x27;ve been using it for two years... just a note..wash your hair first with a shampoo thats good but less expensive ... this stuff works WAY better when its put on an already washed scalp.</li>
    <li> I have done some research and this product contains \\&quot;ketocanozole\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;A key ingredient that keeps your scalp and hair healthy to encourage growth and thickening.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;ketocanozole\\&quot; has been prescribed by dermatologists to clear skin of bacteria...that creates dark patches or spots on skin.&lt;br /&gt;It helped clear me of this one summer, and I was surprised to see the ingredient included in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are quite slow, but I do feel that it helps to keep the hair that I have left and somewhat thickens the more months that I have used it regularly. I alternate between this and my regular shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Whether it helps to grow new hair...honestly, I feel it depends on each person&#x27;s unique scalp and the interaction with this product. I have not seen any significant new growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is also claims to be safe on chemically treated or color-treated hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but not a miracle worker...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re already bald/severely balding it&#x27;s not going to reverse bad damage.&lt;br /&gt;It will prevent further thinning/balding though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell my hair groes WAY faster too... I literally need a haircut within a week and a half&lt;br /&gt;now, whereas before I was getting haircuts every 2-3 weeks.</li>
    <li> A $20.00 bottle of shampoo seems a little steep but I have tried everything else on the market and I don&#x27;t see any visible results. Its been 3 weeks since I started using it and even though it has help with my dryness, the itching still there and I have not noticed any change as far as hair loss.</li>
    <li> I just received this shampoo as well as the biotin conditioner and I have to say this is the best hair loss product I have ever used. I love the way it makes my hair feel. My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch as much as it used to. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the long term effects of using this product is!!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Best one I&#x27;ve used so far. Leaves your scalp feeling tingly , clean , and refreshed. My hair is healthier looking with only a few weeks of use. Dandruff is history , and best of all my hair is thicker and more vibrant. For a guy going into his late 20s with thinning hair this is great stuff. I would recommend this shampoo , ingredients are all pure and has no chemicals . My hair can tell the difference already. Worth the price without a doubt , I&#x27;ll be ordering more .</li>
    <li> This shampoo is simply amazing. I suffer from terrible dermatitis on my scalp so my head is very itchy and sensitive. It is so important that I use shampoos that wont inflame my scalp. Unlike most products, this one works well. Not only is it helping my male pattern hair loss but it also helps fight my dermatitis. I&#x27;m relieved because most products help one while hurting the other. This helps both (hair loss and itchy scalp). I have added it to my rotation of doctor recommended scalp shampoos. Im thankful that i came across it. Been using it for 8 months, definitely worth a try.</li>
    <li> Only been using the products (NT &amp;DR) for about a week, after the first use my thin hair had a lot more volume and was more manageable. I use hair gel daily and my hair would typically curl or bend on the front due to my thinning and receding hairline but thanks to this product I can already see a big different in the strength of my hair, I can spike it a bit more and it looks nicer. Can&#x27;t comment on the hairloss or regrowth of hair yet but I&#x27;m sure it will do what it&#x27;s supposed to do in time.</li>
    <li> Along with antifungal agents linolenic acic, salicylic acid and aloe vera gel,this product has ketoconazole, reputed to be the most effective antifugal agent for malassezia, a common body yeast that grows out of control during periods of immuno-dysfunction brought on by extreme emotional distress, diabetes, prolonged use of steroids and antibiotics and other causes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weeks and weeks of trying a myriad of other non-pharmaceutical treatments (bleach, borax, alcohol and epsom salts baths, tea tree oil, among others) I tried Renegepure in conjunction with topical clotrimazole (a jock itch cream sold at Walgreens). Relief was dramatic and overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A diabetic friend of mine had a severe case of undiagnosed SD that his doctor had been treating unsuccessfully with antibiotics. The back of his head had open sores that he had to cover with unsightly bandages. He couldn&#x27;t get work because of his appearance. I told him I thought he had SD and to try Regenepure and if it worked it proved his diagnosis of SD. He did and it did, saving him beaucoup $$. (His doctor later confirmed my diagnosis.)</li>
    <li> It does indeed help your scalp get rid of the dandruff. It&#x27;s medicated so but gives a little bit of a tingle and regular usage does indeed stop the dandruff</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff, adds some life and thickness to oily hair. Does not contain the nasty chemical ingredients that Nioxin does but does contain the same active ingredient (Ketokoanazole) that Nioxin does. It does however contain hydrolyzed wheat protein so may not be ideal for anyone with gluten sensitivity, Overall a satisying experience, has a nice minty scent and makes your scalp tingle slightly, hair has more volume and texture, more manageable after dry.</li>
    <li> Really liking this product.  Like all hair loss products, it makes bigger claims than it can realistically produce, however, my hair and scalp feel pretty good after showering and through the day.  I use the DR only a couple times a week and the NT a couple times a week.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for about a month. I have definitely noticed a decrease in the number of hairs lost everyday in the shower. I used to lose 10-20 hairs in the shower, but I am down to about 2-6. While my hair is not falling out on the shower, my hair still falls out when I blow dry, so it all evens out to the amount I used to lose before using this product. I can&#x27;t tell if the hairs lost from blow drying are falling from the scalp, or if it is my hair breaking off because this leave my hair so dry.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for soreness and dandruff on my scalp. I used it every other day and both the soreness and dandruff have died down considerably. I used it everyday for about a week and the dandruff completely went away. The soreness seems to go away best when using it every other day though, so it may be different for you. I have another bottle left to hopefully see more improvement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any fuller or thicker hair, but this shampoo has effectively combatted my intermittent sebhorreic dermatitis.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0032FSDOA Regenepure - DR Doctor Recommended Hair Loss Shampoo for Hair Growth and Scalp Treatment - 8 Oz]]&lt;br /&gt;This is a excellent product. My hair feels fuller, and less hair falling out. I would recommend this to all my friends..</li>
    <li> Im not sure if I really noticed a difference other than it felt great and tingles. I did like the way it felt applying it, but my hair would be flat after use. I alternated this with nioxin and it made both last a while. I didnt see any gains, or notice any thinning either, so I guess it does what its supposed to.</li>
    <li> DR and NR are a great combination.  I used the DR solo and this time added the NR.  I have oily hair and the DR/NR combination work great and, although not a volume type shampoo, have added volume to my hair after use.  The DR doesn&#x27;t have much of a fragrance to it but the NR does have a nice fragrance to it...not flowery or fruity.  I am a male with short thin hair and have been using this product for approximately 10 months with great results.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells and feels good.  I really can&#x27;t rate it&#x27;s hair loss claims as I only have used it for a few months, and it takes about 6 months to see results.</li>
    <li> I have oily &amp; thinning hair, which has been a problem for me for years. It seems&lt;br /&gt;like every product I use just makes my hair limp, which doesn’t help since it’s&lt;br /&gt;already thin! I really am enjoying this shampoo for my thinning hair. I use it&lt;br /&gt;once a day, and it leaves my hair feeling less oily &amp; thicker once it dries. I&lt;br /&gt;have read a few reviews where people talk about ketoconazole &amp; how it can have a&lt;br /&gt;drying effect on your hair. I think that in cases of people with oily hair like&lt;br /&gt;me, it works really well. I’ve been using this for 5 weeks now, and I have&lt;br /&gt;noticed I don’t shed as much as I used to. I will be buying this shampoo again!</li>
    <li> The shampoo seemed to work the first time I tried it but the second time not so much.</li>
    <li> I naturally have normal to dry hair and have suffered from extreme dandruff over the past couple of years and Regenepure DR has improved my scalp health immensely. The bottle says to leave in hair for 3 to 5 min and within the first 10 sec I started to feel a nice tingly/soothing sensation on my scalp and after I got out of the shower and my hair had a chance to dry, it not only felt really clean but I could already see an improvement in my dandruff after just one use.  I would definitely recommend Regenepure DR to anyone who suffers from dandruff.</li>
    <li> I originally used Nizoral, but it stopped being sold for a period of time.  I came across this product and have had it meet all my needs.  No odd smell, quick relief of seborrheic dermatitis, and I only have to use a little of it 2 to 3 times a week.  Note that getting away from hair gel has also been huge for me.  I now use coconut oil and now only use shampoo around 3-4 times a week.  No more conditioners or styling gel, just the coconut oil: [[ASIN:B0030F4TZO Organic Root Stimulator Coconut Oil, 5.5 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> I used to have a lot of dandruff and have tried using  shampoos like Hair Surge, Pura d&#x27;or gold. None of them worked. This is by far the best shampoo and dont see dandruff any more after using twice.I definetly recommend this shampoo to cure dandruff related problems.</li>
    <li> Good product. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great Shampoo. My hair feels great after use. I believe it helps prevent hair loss and dandruff. Also does NOT contain any kind of sulfates, which is said should be avoided.</li>
    <li> Great daily shampoo with ketoconazole in it which is proven to lower DHT in the scalp.  Less harsh than Nizoral, so can be used every day.  I have been using for years.  I will be trying their new conditioner soon as well.</li>
    <li> Works great for me,excessive shedding has stopped.Cool soothing tingle while using and leaves hair really clean.Plan to purchase more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Really grows hair. I&#x27;m even surprised!!!!</li>
    <li> Great seller alright product, nizarol is still needed</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo for my husband who is 26 and already going bald. Glad to say it really does help!!! I was impressed with the hair growth. Totally recommend!</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for hair loss and dandruff. Leaves my hair feelings smooth and fresh.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very good quality shampoo. I bought 3 of them in 2013. It makes my hair thicker and leaves my scalp feeling refreshed. I have seen some new hair growth on top of my head, but not in my hairline yet. Ever since using this shampoo, my hair shedding has stopped. I recommend this shampoo to everyone.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! Smells great and my wife loves it. I will be ordering it again for sure,.  I cant wait until my next bottle shows up. All my friends see results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year ever since I noticed my thinning hair (especially in the front regions of my scalp). I feel confident using this product because I feel as though the thinning has stopped or at least slowed down. To be honest, however, I am not sure that this product alone has been the sole cause of my slowed hair loss but I feel confident enough to purchase this product again and again as this shampoo seems to have other positive affects on my scalp as well. For one, my scalp used to be quite noticeable red and itchy. After using this product the redness and itchiness have subsided significantly (I also rub aloe vera gel on my hair after showering). A second reason I like this shampoo is that it does not seem to contain harsh chemicals that overly dry my scalp. A third reason I like this shampoo is that it is not too fragrant. With all of these attributes and with emphasis on feeling like this has reduced my hair loss, I will continuously buy this product. Although the price may be a bit high at $25, it&#x27;s not too bad considering I used to buy $300 sneakers back when I was in high school.</li>
    <li> I write very few reviews; generally only if a product is awful or truly great will I make the effort. This product is truly great. I have seen a marked improvement in my thinning hair in only a little over 3 months time. This product doesn&#x27;t rely purely on anecdote, conjecture, and extrapolation from animal studies, by the way. A human study comparing ketoconazole shampoo to minoxidil topical found a similar improvement in hair shaft diameter and better hair follicle density with ketoconazole. I&#x27;m going to use this for 6 months and then take stock and see if I want to take the extra step and go on minoxidil topical as well, but at present I&#x27;m leaning away from it since this has worked so well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also take Biotin and MSM, which have some limited evidence in being beneficial for hair health, as well as some ancillary benefits. I recommend taking these as well (brand probably doesn&#x27;t matter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have now been using this shampoo daily for a little under 9 months. I have not lost any more hair and the slight thinning in the Norwood II areas has actually improved somewhat. Additionally, I previously had mild inflammation of my scalp with an itching / burning sensation, which came on at the same time as my initial hair thinning. That is now gone. I do not feel the need to go on minoxidil topical at this time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about 20 days, so I think I can write an review now as I feel the improvement after this period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problems of mine：&lt;br /&gt;1) Scalp acne&lt;br /&gt;2) Scalp irritation&lt;br /&gt;3) Fine and tiny dandruff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems listed above have been completely solved and my scalp now feel better and fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How long can the shampoo last?&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is sufficient for 1 month usage or slightly longer if your hair is short like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does the shampoo smell and feel?&lt;br /&gt;Smell: The shampoo does not have any fruity or special kind of smell, it kind of smell like bubblegum if you ask me haha.&lt;br /&gt;Feel:  The amount of bubble is moderate when you wash your hair and it feels pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Great product, result is shown in photos.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to buy another bottle before I go back to Malaysia.&lt;br /&gt;I am interested in Regenepure Precision Minoxidil Spray, 2 oz but unfortunately it is kinda pricey for me. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks regenepure for making this amazing shampoo, here is my honest review for your product.</li>
    <li> I have used &amp;#34;Regenepure - DR&amp;#34; for a few years now and for dandruff this shampoo is pretty great, but for my hair loss it doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. The smell of the shampoo is very nice especially if you like mint. If you use this just as a normal shampoo without any expectation of growing hair back then will be happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen significant growth..</li>
    <li> I use this product intermittently and like it.  It tingles a little and the ingredients are all really good for your hair.  My mom claims that Ketoconazole helps fight hair loss, so my husband and I both use it sometimes, as we both have thinning hair.  It&#x27;s pretty expensive to use every day and it doesn&#x27;t lather that well (which means a lot considering I use only sulfate free shampoos and most of my shampoos don&#x27;t lather well), but I like the way it feels and believe in the ingredients.  It smells fine (light non-offensive with a hint of mint) and the actual shampoo has golden color.  This bottle has lasted me a while and it seems to work fine with my color treated hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hoping to find something that might help with my hair loss.  This isn&#x27;t it. Because once I use it, my hair is so knotted and tangled that I just about pull what hair I have left out when I try to brush it!!!  This may be a great product for men who have short hair.  But as a female with shoulder length hair......NO WAY!!!</li>
    <li> I tried different shampoo the cheapest one to the most expensive, nothing work. Searching and searching for a good one and thanks to all the review I decided to try Regenepure..Wow this shampoo is the best shampoo ever. I&#x27;m using this shampoo for 7 months. Highly recommended...the best shampoo that you can get!</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hair twice to get a thorough clean feel.  It doesn&#x27;t have much lather so therefore doesn&#x27;t clean as good i guess.  My hair doesnt feel as thick compared to the previous shampoo i used.  I&#x27;m prob going back to it after this bottle is done.  Hope it helps others ppl out there.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. Reduces scalp itching and dandruff.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for two years and loved it. I found my hair to be thicker, even my hair dresser said that my hair was fuller and not sparse as before. (yeah!)  But BEWARE! After using this product over a long period of time, I experience an itchy rash on the hairline of my face &amp; neck where my hair falls; even my head was itchy. I then went to a Dermotologist and was informed it was a result of the shampoo I was using. So, I switched shampoo &amp; conditioner and the rash went away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll leave it up to you to consider buying this considering the price, but at least one claim has worked wonderfully for me. I had pretty bad dandruff, and after a few uses it disappeared and left my hair clean for longer (dandruff did not come back after finishing bottle). On that front it was amazing.   Now the other claim that it might grow back some hair, I find dubious. At the very best it leaves hair thick-er and fuller, but after a whole bottle I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed a noticeable improvement. Maybe you need to use it for multiple months (read: multiple bottles), but for my money I&#x27;ll probably just buy it once in while if my dandruff comes back.</li>
    <li> Very timely delivery, and am very happy with this product</li>
    <li> This product works well for my hair in the fact it maintains the hair I have and does make it fuller. I wish I would have started using this sooner.</li>
    <li> Great product! Received on time. Very satisfied with the services and I recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> seems to affect my scalp, I really havn&#x27;t seen any difference yet.  I use it as directed and I guess I will wait and see.</li>
    <li> The product definitely stopped my dandruff. I don&#x27;t know if it increased hair growth; however, overall, I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> FOR EVERYONE ABOUT TO READ MY REVIEW, I suggest you refer back to a review made by \\&quot;R B\\&quot; because it definitely sums up a lot my experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this 1% ketoconozol Regenepure shampoo for about a month now. Of course, you will always hear that you need to give these treatments time to really know if they are what they&#x27;re chalked up to be. Since I have been using Regenpure DR, I have lost much more hair near my temples, probably 10x more than I ever had even without treatment and it has not slowed since using it. What is worse is that I have experienced much more itching of a feeling on my hairline. Generally, I associate this itching feeling with hair-loss itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was using Nizoral 2% for a year(scarcely, 2 times a week) I would never experience itching and my hairline stayed the same. I think I will go back to using nizoral 2%, if I can find one with the same good ol&#x27; formula that it contained. I decided to purchase the Regenepure DR after watching a few youtube videos from the hairlossfromsteroids guy, who does seem pretty genuine, but after reading \\&quot;R B\\&quot;&#x27;s review it certainly seems ridiculous to take his advice seeing he is currently taking propecia, monoxodil, and has had transplants. The hairlossfromsteriods guy reccommended buying this with the lipogaine(monoxodil) treatment, which I resultantly bought as an impulse buy for the fear of my hair-loss progressing. But I think now, after doing some reflection, I think I&#x27;m going to return it seeing as how expensive it is($25 per month) and how if you ever decide to stop using it, it will pretty much eat all of your hair away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I think this Regenepure DR 1% is a joke thusfar, and I&#x27;m not going to waste anymore time seeing what other damage it can do to my hair. I will probably pick up another bottle of nizoral and just relax my anxiety about the whole hairloss thing. Cheers.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and the fact that some people said it worked made me want to give it a shot. Obviously different products have different effects on different people but I can tell you that this product did not work for me. I left it in for 5 minutes nearly every day and followed directions and my hair just fell out faster than ever. I bought the combo pack, spending $50, and ended up throwing the second bottle out. Definitely buy one bottle before splurging for two. Good luck to you... but if after a month of your hair just &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; I advise stopping because it&#x27;s only going to get worse.</li>
    <li> Good product, goes well with any Minoxidil formulas, and does everything a dandruff product must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previously I was using Ketoconazole shampoo to combat dandruff, and while on Minoxidil. But, had to bear inflammation, some times worse. I read articles from people using this product, and there was strong mention about this reducing inflammation. So, gave it a try, and its quite true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience and research about this product is outlined as below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros (compared to other Ketoconazole shampoos):&lt;br /&gt;  -  when on Minoxidil, helps against inflammation (due to aloe vera)&lt;br /&gt;  -  additional hair loss combating ingredients like Saw Palmetto, Vitamin B6 and Zinc Oxide(though not a fan of Saw Palmetto,&lt;br /&gt;  should not harm you either)&lt;br /&gt;  - could be used daily (but maintaining cycles along with [[ASIN:B00CHJV6Q4 Tresemme Climate Control Shampoo, 32 Ounce]], worked for me)&lt;br /&gt;  - chilly sensation on the scalp every time I use (minty)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  - its not a volumizer, leaves hair more down and flat (depends on hair type)&lt;br /&gt;  - less foam, difficult to rinse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no \\&quot;GOD\\&quot; product which could help combat everything, so it is good to use this product in cycles with other products, to get the overall desired effect. Would recommend to use volumizers along with this product.</li>
    <li> Seems to work if you use it everyday</li>
    <li> The best shampoo I ever use, love it!</li>
    <li> A great addition to your regimen. This product along with Lipogaine has actually regrown the hair that I lost. Don&#x27;t hesitate, get it before all your hair falls out.</li>
    <li> The short summary, is that I totally recommend this shampoo and happily give the product five stars (I truly believe the product deserves it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was searching for a Ketoconazole shampoo, and after a bit of research, came across &amp;#34;Regenepure&amp;#34;. I use it in conjunction with Rogaine foam in the morning, and Lipogaine liquid at night to assist with hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;I use a small amount of the shampoo (or a very small amount of a generic shampoo) first in my hair and then rinse it out. The reason I do this, is that the second application will lather up exponentially better, and helps me conserve the amount of shampoo I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rub the Regenepure shampoo into my hair, focusing primarily on the scalp. I also apply a little extra fine layer of the shampoo to each of my hairlines (sometimes the crown) and don&#x27;t really rub this in -- I leave the shampoo on for around 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may notice a pleasant tingling sensation when first using the shampoo. This is especially true if you apply a fine layer to your hairlines. In addition, although not my primary concern, it does have a nice texture and smell (almost minty).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Potential Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Cost - Although the price is arguable high, my bottles tend to last quite a while and I do believe the &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; line rings true here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not lather up well - this is to be expected, as it does not contain some of the arguable &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients that cause a shampoo to foam. The work around, is to use a very small amount of the shampoo first through your hair and then rinse it out -- the second application will lather up exponentially better. You can also use a small amount of another shampoo for the first application to conserve your Regenepure supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. For me, it did not cure my &amp;#34;itchy scalp&amp;#34;; however, in my case the itchiness (and flakes) was caused primarily by morning/night applications ofLipogaine (Minoxidil). Switching to Rogaine foam in the morning, and Lipogaine liquid at night has all but stopped the itchiness and drastically reduced the amount of &amp;#34;white flakes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Where I do believe it has helped hair growth, I would not recommend this product alone to fight hair loss -- I believe it is best used with 5% Minoxidil. On the flip side, I would also not recommend using Minoxidil alone, and would totally 100% recommend using this shampoo in addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used another brand of Ketoconazole shampoo (Lipogaine, the Big 3) as well; however, it left my hair feeling noticeably dry (it&#x27;s to my understanding that Ketoconazole is drying, which is why the Aloe in Regenepure helps counter balance that effect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recommend that you, at least, give Regenepure a try - it&#x27;s my favorite shampoo by far, and I hope they keep making the product for years to come.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Regenepure DR by itself, almost daily, for just over a year now. I&#x27;ve also since then been using 5% minoxidil, and so it&#x27;s hard to attribute all my hair growth/retention to Regenepure DR. However, this summer I took a break from the shampoo for a couple weeks, just to see what would happen, while maintaining my minoxidil applications, and noticed much more hair thinning toward the front of my head; the advanced thinning stopped when I continued its use. So, I&#x27;m rather sure that while Regenepure DR isn&#x27;t too effective at growing hair back (as ketoconazole, its active ingredient, isn&#x27;t known for doing), it is effective at retaining much of the hair you have (which ketoconazole is known for doing). I still have a relatively full head of hair, with some thinning present on the crown and some lightly emerging on the sides and front, and so couldn&#x27;t attest to Regenepure DR&#x27;s efficacy on more advanced stages of male pattern baldness. I also think it&#x27;s pretty important to note that I&#x27;ve had all the success I&#x27;ve had with Regenepure DR not using Regenepure NT. Essentially, I think it&#x27;s pretty expendable to your routine if you already use a good conditioner (I just use a cheap Suave humecant); the Regenepure DR will probably run you about a bottle a month, at around $30, and so it&#x27;s good to cut corners like Regenepure NT whenever possible if on a budget. All in all, Regenepure DR is a great and revitalizing shampoo in general, and seems to be rather effective in slowing thinning. Although its price is a little steep, I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought the first bottle a few months back to test the product. My hair was starting to thin out at the top and I had been using Head &amp; Shoulders or Pert Plus for almost a decade. I thought the strength of those shampoo may have been a contributing factor on the thinning. Over the next month, I geniunely feel like my hair feels fuller. Though this may just be perception, at least I know I have stemmed the damage I have been doing to my scalp. It&#x27;s an expensive produce to be sure but I think it&#x27;s worth it. I bought a second bottle and I have no intention of stopping for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> I think its a good shampoo in that it has no sulfates and the ingredients seem healthier than in most shampoos. I would give it 5 stars if I had actually seen hair regrowth. I&#x27;ve been using it for like 3 months now. I will give an update in 6 months. It&#x27;s cost effective too because one bottle has lasted me about 3 months. I bought a second bottle and haven&#x27;t started it yet.  I bought another bottle to see if it would help regrow my thinning hair. Absolutely no change! This shampoo is not worth the 25 dollar price. I won&#x27;t purchase another bottle. Too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This seems to be working well, my hair looks and feels thicker!</li>
    <li> I used to have itchy scalp and dandruff. A friend of mine recommended this shampoo and I tried it. The itching and dandruff both have gone away. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Two things I suggest people that use this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t wash your your head every day. Try instead every other day.&lt;br /&gt;- Use generously on your scalp when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 weeks the dandruff has stopped and I think it&#x27;s helping to stop my head from going completely bald. After 3 months I will give 5 stars if I stay the same or keep improving.</li>
    <li> Nice ingredient list has helped me in keeping what I have will continue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. After two weeks of use I no longer have hair on my hands before or after using this product. I am able to visibly see the hair loss area reduce in size. Great product.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation for thinning hair. A girl from work made the comment &amp;#34;You should try Bosley&amp;#34; That was the last straw for me. My hair had been thinning and my mom would make comments whenever I would buzz my hair but I never thought much about it. After the comment I went a ahead with purchasing this and also the kirkland generic minoxidil and after 3 or 4 weeks one of the girls who was there during the Bosley comment asked If my hair was growing back. That was enough for me to call it a success. There is still a while to go before reaching optimum results but I definitely recommend this shampoo to help combat male pattern baldness.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know when or if it will happen!!! Slow down my hair loss or stop it!! First time I used it loved it because it thickened the hell out of my hair especially the other one NT, but my hair loss is still alot 30-50 hair everytime I shower. I know its not gong to happen overnight but hopefully soon !!! Everyone says to use the Rogaine stuff or something similar but my hair loss is right at the front which they say only helps at the back or crown. Again hopefully I see some results because I  can&#x27;t slick back my hair anymore because you can see my scalp so I have to leave bushy which I&#x27;m starting to hate</li>
    <li> THIS IS VERY GOOD HAIR LOSS SHAMPOO IT ACTUALLY MADE MY HAIR FEEL SOFTER AND STARTED TO REGROW SOME OF MY HAIR BACK AND IT ALSO GOT RID OF MY DANDRUFF...</li>
    <li> So far working very well!</li>
    <li> I noticed that my boyfriend was having some major hair issues. Not only did he have dandruff issues but he also had a lot of hair loss. As soon as i saw this product i thought whats there to lose. After a couple of weeks of use, i noticed that his dandruff had subsided and i noticed that his hair started thickening back up and growing. I was so impressed, it looks so healthy and a lot fuller. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this Shampoo -- it made me and my sons hair fall out and thin. This is a scary product if not used properly.</li>
    <li> The bottle that I received is a clear bottle with a green cap instead of the white bottle pictured (ends up looking green because of the color of the shampoo). The label is white and looks the same. I cant find any other pictures of the style I received anywhere so it does make me wonder if mine is the real deal. I can say that the way it works and the smell definitely matches the description (minty smell/doesnt create a great lather) so I&#x27;m thinking its the real stuff just a different looking bottle. I do like the product as it leaves my hair feeling soft and thicker and also makes my scalp feel very healthy. If anyone else has an opinion on the style of bottle i received please leave a comment.</li>
    <li> I bought this for someone else who was using the &amp;#34;made in Mexico&amp;#34; version of Nioxin previously. He loves it and says it makes his hair fuller.</li>
    <li> This has helped my seborrheic dermatitis immensely and brought instant relief to my itchy scalp.  It can be drying if used every day, I recommend using it once or a twice a week.</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for 1 month. Just got my second bottle.  Great results so far.  Im was losing hair bad and now i dont see any in the shower.  Maybe one or two per day</li>
    <li> I used to use Nioxin, but now this is the only shampoo I will use, it makes my hair fuller, and lighter and much easier to style. It definitely washes and cleans hair back to a much healthier, more volumous look and feel over all.</li>
    <li> I been using the product for three weeks now..  I noticed that every time I put the DR. I realized hair falling..  I was better off this product.  I have never experienced anything like this with any of my old cheap shampoos and conditioners.. Only reason I bough this product is bc I have very thin hair and to protect it from falling.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product finally gave my scalp the relief I was looking for. I was choosing between this and Nizoral and I went with this for the simple fact that this company does not test on animals. Nizoral is owned by Johnson and Johnson who do not test their beauty products but still test in other departments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve washed my hair twice in the past week with this and my dandruff is virtually non-existent at this point.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the faint hope it could help reduce or maybe even turn around my frontal hair loss.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of weeks so it&#x27;s too soon to say if it can actually help there, but I wanted to review it now for one reason: it&#x27;s the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  That&#x27;s regardless of whether or not it works on my hair loss.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve tried yet that actually helps my very fine hair look and feel fuller.  I&#x27;m really excited by the fact that it at least makes my hair loss less noticeable.  Worth it for that factor alone!</li>
    <li> Agree with other reviewers re: shady packaging. Cap is sealed, but can easily be unscrewed with no seal on the bottle... Label on bottle was also a little crooked which made me wonder. I doubt this will cause any harm, but I didn&#x27;t want to mess around with it.</li>
    <li> I was taking a supplement to increase my testosterone levels and I found that after a few weeks of using it I experienced more hair loss than normal and my hair appeared thinner; I suspected this was due to increased DHT levels and found Nizoral shampoo being recommended to prevent this. After some research I found this was much cheaper and the reviews were better so I tried it. When I use it every day or every other day it seems to curb my hair loss by about half, to a normal rate that won&#x27;t cause male pattern baldness. After about a month of use my hair also  seems thicker and stronger as well as some new growth along the edges where hair has receded, but I doubt it will do much better than that. This product met my expectations of slowing hair loss by blocking DHT, and I think many negative reviewers simply went in with sky-high expectations for the product; it is no panacea. I do wish it was cheaper, but that is my only real problem with it.</li>
    <li> Used this product many times before. I love the smell when you leave it in in the shower for better absorbtion and I love that it makes my hair always feel thicker. Whenever I stop using this I noticably see my hairline making a break for it. Would never not use this and Lipogaine 5%!</li>
    <li> My hair has been gradually thinning for the past 6-8 months that I&#x27;ve noticed.  I don&#x27;t have any bald spots but the corners of my crown are thinning.  It is not noticeable to anyone except me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure if it is reducing hair loss to be honest.  It definitely is not making it any worse.  With that being said I gave it 4 stars for two reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I had dandruff when my hair loss started.  For me this was worse than actually losing the hair because dandruff is always noticeable and nothing treated it.  I tried Head and Shoulders, Selsen Blue, and even T-Gel.  Nothing worked until I used this, literally within 3 shampoos dandruff was gone.  I started using it in the late summer, now it&#x27;s cold out and nearly December, still no dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, when my hair loss started I started getting acne around the top of my forehead.  Starting hair loss + dandruff + acne felt like a fate worse than death, but this cleared that acne up within 6-7 shampoos.  Obviously I used facial care as well (mostly Stridex), but acne is completely gone.  I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple since using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, an added bonus is most men when balding also have their scalp itch, this got rid of that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, again I can&#x27;t comment on the hair loss, but I had two other problems which this cleared up.  That alone is worth at least 4 stars for me.</li>
    <li> This product works and yes, It may not restore hair but it will stop thinning hair. So if you are thinning on top GET THIS RIGHT NOW and remember to apply what you need. Work up a lather and leave in for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> First of all,  there is another reviewer who feels the same as I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; We both have white caps and the picture shown is  green. Also my labels don&#x27;t look as nicely printed as the pictures. I have top spillage on the cap in between the plastic cover and cap and a dent in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, there is no way for me to ascertain if this is legit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer claims he had a response to regenepure stating that the white caps are being used now because of a &amp;#34;shortage&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m iffy on that. Either way, they should update the picture if white is now being shipped and the product should not be damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also some cheap paper labels stating that it is a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; bottle which makes me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really doest have the polish I expected. Asked for refund. Maybe I got a bad apple.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I noticed that I was losing a lot of hair in the shower and my hair was thinning so I decided to do something about it the first time. I first tried organic shampoos since its cheap like Avalon Biotin shampoos but it didn&#x27;t do anything. Only thing it did was make my hair grow faster but was still losing same amount of hairs in the shower as well as having more flakes in my scalp so I decided to give up and not make a big deal about it. During the summer of last year like around August I went to the barber to get a haircut. After he finished he let me know that now that my hair is short, I should use 2% minoxidil to keep my hair that I can get in drugstores. The barber letting me know was like a reality check so I decided to do something about it the second time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking around the web and finding other alternatives I saw a youtube video review of Regenepure DR. Sounded great but was skeptical until I saw the clinical studies of Ketoconazole in the description of the video. I also googled Ketoconzole and found other interesting research and clinical studies as well as the shampoos website and made up my mind. I bought Regenepure DR in September of 2012. At first for the first couple of weeks, I was using it every other day but now use it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed. I use to get migraine headaches like an average of once or twice a week. That has toned down since using Regenepure DR. I get it now like once every 2 months or so but in minor headaches. I researched and the three ingredients in Regenepure DR that I believe helped with my migraine headaches is Caffeine, Emu Oil and Saw Palmetto. The latter two there hasn&#x27;t been much proof but I also use another product thats 100% Emu Oil and it does help relieve pain in other parts of the body (shoulder, arms, wrist, etc.)so I&#x27;m going by personal experience. There could be other ingredients in Regenepure that might&#x27;ve helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of helping with my hairloss, I didn&#x27;t get results until 2 1/2 to 3 months. Yes, even when using it the first time I notice less hair in the shower but not much. Around the end of November to December it got to the point where the amount of hairs I would lose in the shower has toned down dramatically. To the point where I would barely notice. That proved to me right there that Regenepure DR DOES PREVENT further loss. In terms of regrowth, that&#x27;s a question mark to be honest. I will say that it looks like as of now in March 2013 as of this writing the right side near my forehead, its looking thicker since before it was starting to recede.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenepure DR isn&#x27;t the only thing I&#x27;m currently using. After the Holidays, I purchased 20% Azelaic Acid by Better Complexions and New Spa Microneedle System Roller 1.5mm. It has helped me even more. Azelaic Acid is an acne and roscea treatment. I was using Azelaic Acid everyday at first but I heard that it might cause skin problems later on but I don&#x27;t know. What Azelaic Acid does is it inhibits both types of DHT and kills off over 90% of DHT topically. DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)is both connected to acne and attacking your hair follicles. Some Minoxidil carriers do add 5% Azelaic Acid in their products. I didn&#x27;t experience any sides or skin issues from Azelaic Acid. And Microneedle Roller is a collagen induction therapy which will help Ketoconazole and Azelaic Acid absorb better. I use Regenepure DR everyday, Azelaic Acid 4 times a week and Microneedle roller like twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t used any FDA products for hair loss because of side effects and personally I will never use Propecia but I might use a generic minoxidil in the future but for now Regenepure DR + 20% Azelaic Acid + Microneedle Roller &#x3D; Success. You can get them all from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not guaranteeing anything here since some products works while others don&#x27;t for others so keep that in mind since every hairloss is different from one another. And there&#x27;s tons of products out there that are either scams or don&#x27;t work. There aren&#x27;t many things that work for hairloss. Just stick with FDA approved products and/or clinical studies. Also research, research, research.</li>
    <li> This works great for dandruff. Not that I had a lot so I probably should never have tried this. I just wanted to try a different one than Head and Shoulders.  I thought it was making my hair shed a bit too much.  This actually lessens hair shedding I think which is great.  Unfortunately this had the unwanted side effect of making my scalp smell somehow after about a week of use.  It may have exacerbated some other flora or fauna or some kind of yeast on my head or something. Very distressing.  I immediately stopped using it.  Took awhile for the smell to go away, but thank god it did.  Switched to a different shampoos in the meantime, cut out sulfates, and started taking a probiotic based on some advice I found on a forum of other&#x27;s who&#x27;ve had similar problems (not w/this shampoo, just in general.)  This product was a mistake for me, and I definitely cannot use it again.</li>
    <li> my initial expectation was that it likely won&#x27;t regrow hair, but i felt it would at least slow down / stop fallout. WRONG!! after weeks of use, my shower tub would still be covered with follicles. I thought maybe I just need to try this for longer, so i ordered a SECOND bottle - and still no difference. Still follicles everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;this might work for some people, unfortunately i wasn&#x27;t one of them. my search goes on...</li>
    <li> My hair was terrible. It was dried out, flaky, frizzy, and I would lose giant clumps of hair in the shower. Totally disgusting. I used to have very thick, curly hair.  I tried a few different dandruff shampoos. Nothing worked. I was about to go to the doctor and complain about my embarrassing hair problem, but I decided to try something with ketoconazole.  I bought my first bottle of Regenepure DR in October 2012, and my scalp was significantly less flaky within one week. Within a month, I had no flakes. I did not see much improvement with the hair shedding. I bought another bottle, and I am now seeing results with the hair shedding. I lose about four strands in the shower compared to a handful before. My hair is not found all over the house anymore. So, this product actually works as described if you use it for a significant amount of time. You will probably see immediate results with dandruff, but you will not see less hair loss within a month. It took six months to notice a complete turnaround for me. This product is amazing, and it is definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a decent shampoo but it didnt make my hair look that great and it irritated my scalp. I haven&#x27;t used it long term to know if it helped my hairloss.</li>
    <li> Decent enough as far as a shampoo, but not for the price. I&#x27;ll reserve judgement until I&#x27;ve finished the bottle, but results,aATP, are not encouraging.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly oily skin and scalp.  Over time this has caused a crusty, dandruff like buildup on the top and front of my scalp (I&#x27;m male) consistent with that of male pattern baldness.  No surprise this crusty, oily mess is not conducive for growing thick, healthy hair.  Regular shampoos, even run of the mill dandruff shampoos did little to nothing to help remedy this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this shampoo for about three weeks, the scalp crust is gone and my scalp in general feels great.  I&#x27;m using this product in conjunction with Lipogaine in hopes of growing some thicker hair, but I have not noticed any such improvement yet.  My scalp does feel clean, clear, and healthy though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint with this shampoo is that it is very drying to the hair.  If you have a naturally oily scalp, this probably won&#x27;t be too much of an issue, but if you have a drier to normal scalp, then you want to seriously consider a follow up product to help moisturize your hair.  Regenepure has a scalp nourishing treatment that it pairs with this shampoo that would probably be an ideal product to use.  Another option would be to alternate use of this product with a normal or 2-in1 shampoo every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are supposed to leave this product on your scalp for 3-5 minutes before washing it off, so you&#x27;ll probably find yourself working a little more slowly in the shower than you&#x27;re used to while this treatment does it&#x27;s thing.  The shampoo has a pleasant smell and has a refreshing menthol tingle while on the scalp.  It works well as a general shampoo, though it&#x27;s a bit expensive to use if you don&#x27;t specifically need it&#x27;s treatment properties.  Overall a nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a week so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s hair growth claims, but it feels great! Leaves my scalp and hair feeling healthy and great.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint was the bottle arrived covered in a thick sticky film, and some of it didn&#x27;t seem like it came from the bottle. Weird. Overall I would buy this product again, but maybe from a different seller.</li>
    <li> Yeah. This product works. Better than minoxidil or anything else. Believe me, I tried a lot of things and did a lot of research. This shampoo rocks. 3rd time in and my hair loss basically started to reverse.  Reversed male pattern baldness as well as telogen effluvium. I use it in conjunction with another shampoo - Pura D&#x27;or. Try it. Works.</li>
    <li> This shamppo let me down. I was expecting the description to be true but it wasn&#x27;t. I do agree though, that this shampoo cleansed my head and left it feeling fresh. As far as hair growth....useless.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Lipogaine for 3 months and they&#x27;re really working! Right now I only notice light hairs coming into place (some thick ones seemingly overnight, which is odd but welcomed) but I think in a few more months those will be replaced with thicker hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use this for a week or so without Lipogaine while I was waiting for it to ship. Almost right away my scalp was feeling better. It used to be really irritated and inflamed. When I used other minoxidil products my scalp would be red all day and would cause irritation and inflammation to the point that I would get pimples in some places (probably inflamed follicle or ingrown hair). I got this because it&#x27;s supposed to help with that, from what I hear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works really well and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years now with great results.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got this product for free to review and I would never lie about hair products. My aunt used this when we first got it. I removed all the unwanted problems.  I don&#x27;t believe shampoo can make your hair grow faster but this helped make her hair look healthy. Her hair was a little dryer than normal but that&#x27;s what you get when it&#x27;s removing all that unwanted stuff you have in your hair.  Some people make not know this but you shouldn&#x27;t shampoo your hair everyday it&#x27;s drys out your hair and it&#x27;s not going to grow so much and not as healthy because your taking out all the oil your hair needs to grow and be healthy. My aunt hasn&#x27;t washed her hair in a couple of days and all we have seen is it&#x27;s dry. Her hair loss isn&#x27;t as bad as it was before using this product which I was amazed by that.  The smell is mint which we liked and why she wanted to use it again when she needs it. The smell don&#x27;t go away after you raise t stays which a lot of my high end shampoos I get in the salon don&#x27;t do. I never have that smell in shampoo. I would recommended this product to someone who has a problem with a lot of hair loss to try this because so far it&#x27;s worked for my aunt. I haven&#x27;t seen her hair fall out as must as it was before using this product. I would love to try some more of this companies products and review them for everyone to know about some other products they have.</li>
    <li> Great product, my hair and scalp feel great. It is so much better than Nizoral shampoo, because it does not fry your hair. I will reorder this product again</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  I can see a difference in my hair after using it for a few times.  My hair was thicker and more manageable.  I would not hesitate to recommend this shampoo.  :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get tangles out of my hair, even when using conditioner.  I lose a lot of hair trying to get it combed out.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for hair loss, I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for the last three years and since the beginning I noticed the improvement on my hair lost problem. I really happy with how this product works. I am no really sure if can regrow hair but I do know that it stop my hair loss and I am only 30 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;It also helps with dandruff.</li>
    <li> Purchased the combo as recommended, and received no results. My thinning is very early and unnoticeable to others but this shampoo and conditioner did nothing. Most of the positive reviews are most likely customers who have the placebo effect or fake reviews by the company.</li>
    <li> Came on time, but was not my favorite at all. This is personal, you can try it and pethaps you&#x27;ll love it. My favorite is Nizoral, but it is so hard to find now...</li>
    <li> This product is 1% ketaconazole.  I had a really hard time finding that information, so I&#x27;m gonna&#x27; throw it out there.</li>
    <li> All I can tell you is that this stuff smells great.  Kind of like spearmint.  But it had no effect that I could see.  My hair felt the same as always, my scalp had the same scratchiness it always seems to have, and I certainly saw no hair regrowth. There was no difference in ease of styling.  There was no faster growth. As far as I can tell, it is a great-smelling, overpriced shampoo.  I really wish I could tell you it grew hair, but it did not.</li>
    <li> Regenepure does NOT regenerate your natural hair-growth.  If your you&#x27;re looking for that, then seek out surgical or medicinal alternatives in combination with Minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the product DID do for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  It controlled my dandruff without over-drying or irritating my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;-  It slowed down the thinning and the rate at which I was losing my hair-line.&lt;br /&gt;-  It made my hair feel and look very healthy and clean; it smells fantastic too (kind of like spearmint).&lt;br /&gt;-  Lastly, it brought my 15 year battle with Seborrheic Dermatitis in the folds of my smile-lines to an end.  Nothing!  I mean nothing would help.  This skin condition stems from the same cause as dandruff but when it&#x27;s on the face, let&#x27;s just say that using most anti-dandruff shampoos will tear a hole in your skin.  This product is effective but gentle enough for use on bare skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a fantastic product.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey for my taste, but I&#x27;m glad I came across it.</li>
    <li> Im scared to use the product, the bottle is beat up and dirty and the &amp;#34;protective plastic cap&amp;#34; just slides off and you can just unscrew the top. I feel as if I just bought a used shampoo product. I probably just got unlucky but for all i know someone could have swapped the inside  contents of my bottle.</li>
    <li> I have seen no  noticeable results from using this product.  My hair seemed to respond better when I used TherapyG.</li>
    <li> I have alopecia areata and I have tried many shampoos and treatments out there. This product is great because it helps condition and treat the scalp due to inflammation. I highly recommend getting this hair &amp; scalp treatment for anyone that has alopecia or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> When I received the bottle, the holes where the shampoo comes out of the cap were already clogged with shampoo. So, right off the bat I am not trusting this product. I used it, and it made my scalp flake worse! I would NEVER recommend this to anyone for dandruff control, nor would I recommend the product due to concerns that it has been tampered with. I wish I could&#x27;ve gotten a refund. Save yourself money and look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> just what the balding man ordered</li>
    <li> Pricey, but does leave your head feeling tingly and refreshed.  Bought during the Nizoral blackout of a couple years ago- still purchase every now and then when my local target/wal-mart is out of Nizoral.</li>
    <li> Havnt used this shampoo very long but it does make my hair and scalp feel better I&#x27;m using to treat hairless but have not seen any results yet besides hair scalp feeling better.</li>
    <li> Well it came to me with a white cap instead of green and got me worried because someone else here had the same too and he was worried it is a counterfeit and also, the declaration for the item is $20 instead of $25. So, since I ordered direct from Salonceuticals, I emailed them and this is what they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;We are currently producing  RegenePure DR with white caps instead of the green ones due to a shortage. This is the correct product. We only declare $20 on customs so that it clears faster &amp; doesn’t take as long for shipping.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with their fast response. I have only used the shampoo one time. It doesn&#x27;t lather alot so dont use use too much thinking that you didn&#x27;t put enough since there is barely any lather. I suppose at the rate I&#x27;m using it(once a day) it might last me probably 2-3 months. I notice that hair gets very very soft after the first wash and having flat hair on a thinning scalp is not really what I look for but I make up for it with a volumizing shampoo that I use before going out. Overall I have not used this product long enough to tell if it works, but based on reviews and videos on the net, I am pretty confident of my choice. Hope you guys have satisfying effect</li>
    <li> dont like it. i use other shampoo now.</li>
    <li> Dont know if it works, could not use it long enough because it made my hair look so bad, dull and lifeless.</li>
    <li> I have been using Regenepure DR for over a year now and can notice the increase in fullness in my hair. The shampoo also smells great!</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo as a substitute for Nizoral. It is not a substitute for Nizoral. I thought the active ingredients were the same, but for some reason it is not as effective against dandruff as Nizoral.</li>
    <li> I am giving this three stars, because the ingredients are incredible; it contains ketoconazole and other beneficial ingredients and is sulfate-free.  I&#x27;ve only used it once and probably won&#x27;t be able to use it again.  It made my hair incredibly dry, frizzy and tangled.  I used the Regenepure DR followed by the Regenepure NT and the Regenepure conditioner.  I really wanted to like this, so ordered the whole set.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just too damaging to my hair.  I will have to go back to using Nizoral a couple of times a week; I&#x27;ll have the benefit of 1% ketoconazole and still be able to comb through my hair without the dryness and frizziness.</li>
    <li> To my own surprise this product made my scalp more itchy especially immediately after application. It did make my hair to appear more thick and pretty though.</li>
    <li> Not sure about regrowth...but its gentle enough to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;I cant use most shampoos daily because it will throw off my pH balance of my scalp. My hair thins out, drys up, then turns greasy, and I start to flake. This is common with about 90% of shampoos out there. I blame Sodium Laureth Sulfate. This I use daily and I am doing great. Not sure about growing hair, but at least it aint causing me to lose any.</li>
    <li> This shampoo cleared up my seborrheic dermatitis/dandruff within a week of daily use.  I had tried tea tree oil, vinegar rinses, denorex, selsun blue &amp; Neutrogena T/Sal.  None of them worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is expensive...and if you have really good insurance you can probably get something with the same active ingredient prescribed from you doctor.  But for me, the time and effort of going to the doctor &amp; pharmacy just isn&#x27;t worth the savings.  The price of the shampoo is worth it to me.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo,i always buy it from amazon,it cleans well,gets rid of dandruff and relieves my itchy scalp,i have also used nizoral shampoo which is harsh and stripping,although its effective, i prefer something that is not so drying.Regenepure is gentle on hair and can be used daily,it also smells good,does the job well,and i will continue to repurchase.</li>
    <li> I use it two to three times a week, just to mix it up with other shampoos. Regenepure needs to work on packaging. Mine leaked. Luckily it was in a plastic bag. I was going to contact Regenepure, but got lazy and never did.</li>
    <li> I hate it!, expensive little and leaves my hair horrible dry., not happy.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. Now, it doesn&#x27;t lather up real good, because what causes the lather in your other shampoos is the stuff you don&#x27;t want coming into your body. I like the way it makes my hair feel. (yes, I am a guy with long hair). It also makes my hair feel thicker and look thicker. With this shampoo, I feel comfortable not shampooing every day. I have a dry scalp and this does not irritate it in any way. As for growing hair, I really don&#x27;t think so, but I am really happy with my results. Use a good amount, and probably don&#x27;t want to use every day and you wont need to anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with an oily, itchy scalp for years. Then last year I suddenly got some very stubborn dandruff as well. The Head and Shoulders that I was using to deal w/the itch wasn&#x27;t affecting the dandruff at all. After trying many different products, I ended up using Nizoral for awhile. It had been the best at fighting the flakes and itch so far. And then it couldn&#x27;t be found anywhere. At first I was frustrated, but now I&#x27;m glad that supplies dried up because it led me to Regenepure! I found it mentioned on a hair loss site, while I was researching what was going on with Nizoral. In addition to the itchy scalp and dandruff, I&#x27;d also been dealing with some excessive hair shedding for awhile. I&#x27;m only halfway through my first bottle of this stuff and I have no flakes whatsoever, the itch is GREATLY reduced (I doubt I&#x27;ll ever find anything that will ever take it away 100%, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable now), and my shedding is back to a normal amount.&lt;br /&gt;I work it into my hair in sections to make sure that I get some on every part of my scalp (I have long hair), then I suds it all up well and clip it up for the rest of my shower. I&#x27;ve found that letting it sit for a good 10 minutes gives me the best results. The oily scalp also seems to be better. Instead of washing every second day, now I can wash every third day because my hair still looks good. That it&#x27;s paraben and sulfate free is definitely a plus!</li>
    <li> This product made my hair loss worse. I was patient and almost used the whole bottle but got frustrated and threw it out. I had much better luck with Nizoral shampoo. It also smells funky and I felt I was better off with generic drug store shampoo than with this one. I have long fine hair and it left the strands difficult to untangle as well as frayed looking after my hair dried.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t remove dandruff as promised, been using it for more than a month now every alternate day. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
    <li> My hair is soft and feels stronger. I am hopeful that it will grow faster</li>
    <li> This very quickly reversed my dry scalp and had an immediate impact.  This also helped stave off hair loss.  Overall, this is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I thought i&#x27;d give it try but i suffer from seborrheic dermatitis and my scalp itched from just a weeks worth of using thats three times for me.I can not use shampoos with oils in them.</li>
    <li> This 100% does not help with Hair loss, Seriously the biggest scam on earth. I meant to buy 1, and accidentally bought 4(I regret it). So I have used this product for more than 6 months. I gave up half way. Now I am not here to warn others, just giving my opinion. Feel free to try this product and prove me wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss happen, its natural. These companies should be sued though for scamming.</li>
    <li> i think lipogaine shampoo works better, this thinned my hair out more, I feel like you need the suds to achieve the thick look</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it a couple times a week and it does exactly what it is supposed to. Probably not as efficient as Minoxidil and Finasteride, but it is way cheaper and have about no side effects so that&#x27;s great. I should have started using it in my early 20s.</li>
    <li> Have read great things about Regenepure, however there is something about it that just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Scalp feels slightly irritated after use. I have been using Nizoral for a long time and it worked great. Only reason I tried this one is because I was out of Nizoral for a while, but I have since switched back.</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping!! Great product. Thank you!!!!  A++</li>
    <li> My hair loss has decreased by half after using more than half a bottle of Regenepure shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shampoo to anyone who suffers from serious hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Regenepure shampoo for keeping my hair.</li>
    <li> shampoo is ok.  Dont see how others got such amazing results.  Too expensive.  Try and get prescriptions strength ketoconazel.  2%  Actually noticed more hairloss than with 2%.</li>
    <li> When I purchased this, it was sold without the word &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; in a title. There is no word &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; anywhere on the bottle. Directions are like: put this one for a few minutes and rinse few times. There is no direction given as to do I apply it before shampoo and conditioner, in between, instead of? Dirty hair, clean hair? I have finally figured out I should probably use this instead of shampoo, although it says &amp;#34;treatment&amp;#34; on the bottle, because it was not conditioning at all and as shampoo... not sure. Anyhow. I didn&#x27;t see any results in my hair getting thicker or longer faster... I&#x27;ve noticed though I need to use additional conditioner to make my hair silkier and easier brushed.Totally not worth the price</li>
    <li> Absolutely glad i purchased Regenepure, been using it for a month now and my hair feels thicker. My hair loss has minimized and seems to be growing at a steady pace. I would recommend this product. The vendor sent the product super fast and happy with the choice.</li>
    <li> Decent.  Necessary if you have sensitive skin, your scalp gets irritated from this type of shampoobor from your minoxidil use. But, due to the aloe(I believe), it weighs your hair down/makes it flat. Which is not what you want with thin hair.  So, you have to use a volumizing shampoo after if you are planning to go out.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have scalp issues..I highly suggest Lipogain Big 3. It leaves the perfect balance of clean and soft. And, leaves your hair nice and full.</li>
    <li> First things first, there is no miracle hair regrowth product out there.  I&#x27;m a 35 year old man who has VERY thin hair and no amount of shampoo or minoxidil formulas are going to regrow my hair.  However, this product keeps my hair HEALTHIER and I noticed less strands of hair fall out.  This product has left me feeling better about my hair than other products like Nioxin, Grow, Tea Tree, and the few others that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this shampoo are great for the price and they have some positive side effects I wasn&#x27;t expecting. One of those being the fact that I never have dandruff or dry scalp.  I used to live in Colorado and currently live in California where the climate is very dry at, but my hair feels great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s and have moderate diffuse thinning (that is causing gaps in my hair), along with very slight hairline recession.    This is the second hair loss shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. I stumbled upon this shampoo online after hearing a great review from the \\&quot;hair loss from steroids\\&quot; dude, and was hopeful it would improve my situation.    I had previously been using Revita (over 6 months) and the results from using that were inconclusive, so I decided to give this a try because of the aloe and saw palmetto.    I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo exactly as directed for the last 5 months and it made my scalp itch  (as other reviewers have said), something that never happened while using other shampoos.    When it comes to hair loss, Irritation of the scalp is not what you want, so I will be discontinuing this and looking for other alternative.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for months. I haven&#x27;t had any dandruff since I started, and it seems to be helping slow down my hair loss.</li>
    <li> I realized through some research on hair loss forums that ketoconazole shampoos helped grow back hair so I want to try this treatment for my thinning areas where my scalp was beginning to show. This shampoo felt amazing on my scalp and by the end of the first week using it my shedding had greatly diminished and by the 3 month mark I was seeing new growth especially in the front areas of my head. No other product I use had ever done this before. I also was surprised to find this shampoo had such a great line up of ingredients that benefit my curly hair such as jojoba oil and emu oil. Its a bit drying but I use a leave in conditioner afterwards which solves that issue easily. I recommended it to my mom and now we&#x27;re both using it. It&#x27;s truly a beneficial product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, texture, and the after feeling of clean, it makes the hair dry and brittle. I went back to head and shoulders.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for roughly a year now, and while there isn&#x27;t any significant evidence that it&#x27;s doing anything to halt the progression of hair loss, I can say that my hair feels healthier, fuller and more manageable after using this product. Additionally, it does seem that I see less hair going down the drain when I regularly use this shampoo as opposed to before I started, but honestly that could just be my imagination. Ultimately, this is a solid product that is worth the money if you&#x27;re serious about improving the quality of your hair.</li>
    <li> I was originally planning to re-purchase Perfect Image Hair Regrowth Shampoo (Which is great!) but there were recent reviews complaining about getting counterfeit shampoo. So I went with this product instead of risking getting fake shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is all white unlike the picture. I understand that pictures are not always up to date, and there are things like part supply shortages. So that by itself doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is a grey/silver color. The smell isn&#x27;t pleasant like these reviews are saying; although slightly minty-smelling, the other chemicals make it smell bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather at all, which is fine as long as it works, but it&#x27;s hard to tell if it&#x27;s doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sort of un-impressed with the shampoo overall as a substitute for the previously-mentioned shampoo. Seeing as the color/smell doesn&#x27;t match the other reviews, either it has been reformulated, or it&#x27;s fake.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I am a 62 year old female&lt;br /&gt;losing hair at an alarming rate.  My scalp is itchy,&lt;br /&gt;burning and sometimes actually \\&quot;hurts\\&quot; as if someone has&lt;br /&gt;been pulling my hair.  Regenepure DR was recommended to me&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m happy to report that it really has \\&quot;quieted\\&quot; my&lt;br /&gt;scalp.  I don&#x27;t notice less hair loss yet, but the relief&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten from using the DR is wonderful and well worth it.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed any benefit through about one month&#x27;s use, not sure if I would purchase again, we&#x27;ll see how the rest goes.</li>
    <li> It help a little but I&#x27;m gonna wait more to see more improvement. I only used it for 3 months maybe I need a couple of months to see good results.</li>
    <li> this is a expensive shampoo with no results at all. used it two bottles and made my hair fall out more than before. it also made my hair dry to the best..avoid this shampoo...and if your hair falling to much go get a propecia prescription from a doctor and minoxidil..shampoos are not for maintaining hair but rather for cleaning hair.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of the old Nioxin before they changed hands.  Did not have dandruff but it does make my thinning hair seem healthier. Gave it 4 stars because of the size and price being on the high side.  I wash everyday so it did not last long with the length of my hair.  Would not recomend to people with long hair.</li>
    <li> The person this merchandise was purchased for is ecstatic with it. Her hair has grown thicker quickly and is more manageable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have a hair loss problem, (as far as I know since I&#x27;ve been using for a year!) but I found that for my Sebhorric Dermatitis, Regenepure DR is the best for controlling dandruff and itchiness without all the harmful ingredients that the commercial brands love to fry your hair with or having to go to the dermatologist to get a prescription! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> On time and as described. Happy with item.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost a week and can tell that my hair is so much stronger and no longer breaking.  I believe that anything you use on your body should contain natural ingredients or vitamin infused ingredients.  I don&#x27;t need Yellow #5, artificial fragrances or any other garbage.  This stuff worked for me.  Although pricey, you have to pay for what you get.</li>
    <li> Its OK, but not good for severe/long term cases. I was using Nizoral for a while and then transitioned to this, it worked very well for the first 2 weeks, after that, its potency subsided and my dandruff came back. The chemicals used in this are better for your hair (Nizoral left my hair dry and brittle, this didn&#x27;t), BUT its not quite as potent, which I think is due to the soap/chemical ratio. I ended up finding a 2% shampoo called Tiniazol, its amazing. Better than this and cheaper. Its made in mexico but you can find it on Amazon or Ebay imported. I use it all the time and it completely got rid of my dry scalp</li>
    <li> I used this twice and both times i found a lot of hair on my hands. Definately not giving it a third try</li>
    <li> My hair began to thin and feel very dry. I stopped using after a month, glad I did that is for sure. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great product to thicken hair. See results immediately. I use twice a day, better than other shampoos, and no side effects. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I have thinning hair on the top of my head and have tried Nioxin and other products, but Regenepure DR shampoo gave the best results, even after a few uses.  My wife and a couple of my friends even made comments that my hair looked fuller and thicker on top.  All I have used is this shampoo and it&#x27;s doing the trick.  My scalp is very sensitive and does not react to this shampoo.  The smell is pleasing and this is easy to use.  I&#x27;ll continue using this product.</li>
    <li> Of late I have been experiencing the first signs of thinning hair, so I decided to buy this product now, rather than waiting until the problem got even worse. Has this product stimulated new hair growth? I cannot tell. It&#x27;s possible, but I don&#x27;t know. Has it slowed the hair loss? My hunch is that it has, and I know for sure that the problem has not gotten any worse. These facts, combined with the nice smell and the fact that it is by far the best Ketoconazole shampoo I can find on the market (try looking for another one...they are either from very obscure brands that don&#x27;t even have websites, they are from brands that have POOR websites, or they are from brands that are LOADED with fake reviews on Amazon, which is a total turnoff...Regenepure doesn&#x27;t carry as many fake reviews and their website is awesome. I think the quality of the website matters...after all, if a company cannot hire a competent web designer, how good do you expect their QC to be?), warrant a 4-star rating. I would bump it to 5 if, after a while, my confidence grew that it was actually retarding hair loss and stimulating hair growth.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my husband and he loves it.  It is gentle on the hair, without any damaging chemicals, and the result is clean and soft hair.  Not sure about growing hair, but it does a nice job on the head of hair that he&#x27;s got!</li>
    <li> I have done some research and this product contains &amp;#34;ketocanozole&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;A key ingredient that keeps your scalp and hair healthy to encourage growth and thickening.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever!!&lt;br /&gt;Not only stoped my hair loss by helping me control my oily scalp but it thickened my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommedn this to anybody with oily scalp, since thats one of the causes that could lead to exesive hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with revita and have gotten great results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m rating this shampoo based mainly on hair growth, hair loss per day, and whether it prevented me from looking bald. I will update my rating because it might be too early to lower it. I honestly still have reservations about this product and I will be uploading pictures soon to save you money in case this shampoo flops. 3 stars only because it got rid of my dandruff flakes but not sure about hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days I used Regenepure:&lt;br /&gt;started 5/19/&#x27;14: lost 60 strands&lt;br /&gt;5/20/&#x27;14: lost 80 strands&lt;br /&gt;5/22/&#x27;14: lost 56 strands&lt;br /&gt;5/23/&#x27;14: lost 43&lt;br /&gt;5/24/&#x27;14: lost 54&lt;br /&gt;5/25/&#x27;14: lost 22&lt;br /&gt;5/27/&#x27;14: 92&lt;br /&gt;5/28/&#x27;14: 78&lt;br /&gt;5/29/&#x27;14: 60&lt;br /&gt;6/3/&#x27;14: 62&lt;br /&gt;6/5/&#x27;14: 120+&lt;br /&gt;6/18/&#x27;14: 120+&lt;br /&gt;6/23/&#x27;14: 75&lt;br /&gt;6/24/&#x27;14: 51&lt;br /&gt;6/30/&#x27;14: 52&lt;br /&gt;7/2/&#x27;14: 95&lt;br /&gt;7/3/&#x27;14: 52&lt;br /&gt;7/4/&#x27;14:72&lt;br /&gt;7/10/&#x27;14:66&lt;br /&gt;7/21/&#x27;14: 80 noticed about 3 or 4 new hair strands (they are approximately 3 inches long) fall out Every shower at this point. The shampoo curled my hair a little bit and made my hair look thick yet it feels thin and kept shedding at about the same or worse rate, if that made sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stats: 25 years-old, noticed diffuse hair loss in shower mainly on the crown since Jan of 2014. I believe I&#x27;m in the very early stage of Male Pattern Baldness. Pre-Regenepure, I lose about 60-90 scalp hairs every shower. I first started taking supplements (Biotin 5000mcg &amp; Hair-Omega 3-in-1 saw palmetto) as of March but did not see improvement in hair loss. No noticeable baldness yet as of this review  BUT I can already see through my scalp when brushing my hair with fingers or comb. My hair already feels thin.</li>
    <li> Interestingly enough there are two ingredients in this that may be found in other shampoos, but in the other shampoos also have other ingredients that have caused issues for me.  I have had trouble with high testosterone which for women can cause thinning of hair.  The saw palmetto helps with that.  I also have had to contend with systemic candida which also contributes to hair loss. This is where the ketocanozole (sp?) comes in to help.  All in all, I&#x27;ve tried shampoos like Nioxin, and the Biotin organic shampoos, etc.  This is the best.  One thing that helps hugely is to apply the shampoo at the beginning of the shower and leave it on for the duration of the shower.  Condition very last.  I used to shampoo quickly and then leave a conditioner in for the remainder of the shower.  I switched the process after watching a YouTube video on this product which gave this advice.  Sure enough, I&#x27;m seeing bettter results.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo due to hair loss but considering the price, I was somewhat concerned considering the fact that I don&#x27;t tolerate many products due to their scent.  The product appears to help with hair loss and while it has a very mild scent, it washes out completely.  If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances, this product shouldn&#x27;t bother you.</li>
    <li> I have been using Regenepure DR for a few days now and say it is much better than Nizoral. I am able to leave it on my scalp for up to 10 minutes with it have a cooling affect because of the Aloe Vera and not causing irritation. I also like all the ingredients that are in this product because they all seem to be good for someone with thinning hair such as myself. It also has Ketoconazole in it which is proven in studies to inhibit DHT which causes male pattern baldness. I will continue to use it over the next few months and update. So far I like this shampoo and give it five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 03/28/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this shampoo has been great for me. I use it almost everyday or at least every other day, leaving it on for 10 minutes or more without it causing any kind of irritation. I do use a conditioner after I wash out Regenepure DR because it can leave your hair dry. Regenepure DR is also better than Nizoral because it doesn&#x27;t contain sodium laureth sulfate which can cause inflammation. What I also really like about Regenepure DR is that it really cleared up my scalp acne on my head. I still get some acne on my head, but nothing compared to what is use to be, because my scalp use to be covered in it, especially the back and sides of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update* 08/29/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 months of using Regenpure DR, my scalp is very healthy and there is no dandruff. I haven&#x27;t seen really any regrowth. I didn&#x27;t really expect to get a bunch of regrowth on this shampoo, but you can only hope... Although it has kept my hair from shedding and getting any worse. I actually still have a old bottle of Nizoral I tried out, I couldn&#x27;t even keep it on my head for five minutes without it causing irritation. So yea, I&#x27;m done with that shampoo for good. I have left Regenepure DR on my scalp for over 10 minutes numerous times without feeling anything. Anyways nothing much else to say about it, except it is my favorite shampoo to use. Just make sure you use aconditioner if you plan on using it daily.</li>
    <li> After using several ketoconazole shampoos that weren’t making my hair stop shedding, I came across Regenepure DR. It has all the natural ingredients that boost hair growth like emu oil and saw palmetto. I like how this shampoo doesn’t just rely on its ketoconazole like most do but actually has other beneficial ingredients. I was impressed that they didn’t have sulfates or parabens, it’s crazy what a difference removing these chemicals did for my hair. My shedding stopped completely after 3 weeks. I’ve been using it for 2 months now and my hair not only looks fuller but feels thicker too. I haven’t had healthy hair like this since my college years.</li>
    <li> I use this shampoo to slow a receding hairline. Here is why; it has Ketoconazole which is supposed to help remove DHT from the scalp. DHT is a testosterone by product that helps cause receding hair and baldness. This shampoo also has Salicylic acid in it which helps to unclog pores, which removes the dirt and oils to keep the scalp healthy.  If you leave it in the recommended amount of time you can feel it - I don&#x27;t want to say burning maybe cooling, but you can feel it working.  Do not use it more than three times a week, that is only my recommendation. I would think if it was used every day it would start stripping the natural oils you do need in your hair.</li>
    <li> To be honest I think it slowed down the hairloss maybe I keep my hair short so it&#x27;s kinda hard to tell. But I seen some peach fuz on the hairline area</li>
    <li> Regenepure DR gets top marks across the board. I have used this product and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair loss shampoo&#x27;s are a dime a dozen and there are few that actually work. Actually, many will do more harm than good. There is only 1 ingredient in any shampoo on the market to date that is clinically shown to actually work. That ingredient is Ketoconazole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenepure DR is free of Sodium Lauryl Sulphate and another class of chemicals known as parabens. Secondly, it contains Emu Oil and Aloe Vera which are very soothing and act as powerful anti-inflammatory agents. This very effectively mitigates harsh effects of the skins exposure to Ketoconazole while removing the SLS &amp; parabens altogether. Thirdly, it contains other ingredients that although have not been studied extensively like Ketoconazole are widely used in just about every hair loss/hair growth shampoo (Saw Palmetto, caffeine etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use Regenepure DR daily getting the full benefits of its 1% Ketoconazole (the highest NON-Prescription amount allowed by law) without the negative side effects most other hair loss shampoo&#x27;s have. The one other shampoo that I regard as good as Regenepure DR for hair loss prevention is Lipogaine Big 3. Although Lipogaine Big 3 has some distinct advantages also, it is missing one key ingredient that Regenepure DR has, Aloe Vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue I have with Regenepure DR is that it does not add volume/thickness to my hair. It does the job medically in terms of eliminating DHT without fault or fail. It just kind of leaves my hair a little flat. This is easily remedied by using Regenepure NT (Regenepure Nourishing Treatment) which is sold separately. This adds to the cost of your hair loss prevention regiment however, its worth it in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, this product works. It is free of harsh chemicals, it contains the maximum amount of Ketoconazole allowed by law and includes the ingredients that most effectively mitigate irritation/inflamation. Anyone with sensitive skin or who is hypo allergenic should use Regenepure DR. This is tried, true and tested. It works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Key Studies for this are readily available online and I encourage anyone to research this and point to two studies in particular. Firstly, a Study Conducted at the University of Liege, Belgium, 1998 &amp; Juntendo University School of Medicine, Japan, 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is this shampoo leaves your hair very thin and flat. Other shampoos simply add thickening agents but regenepure seems to have left them out in order to get you to buy Regenepure NT and their newer conditioner/thickener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will still use regenepure because it is good but use other products after shampooing. It is a little annoying how they attempt to force you to buy a range of products in order for your already thinning hair to look even presentable (after using regenepure dr my hair is completely unpresentable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the shampoo is very effective in combatting hair loss. Just make sure you have a strategy in place to revamp your hair after using regenepure dr. you could get their regenepure nt and nourishing treatment set with each order but then your looking at a combined cost of $75 per bottle of regenepure...ergenic should use Regenepure DR. This is tried, true and tested. It works.    On a side note: Although I believe its main competitior Lipogaine Big 3 leaves the hair looking a little thicker/fuller, it is not as gentle on the scalp. I find it hard to Recommend either Lipogaine Big 3 or Regenepure DR over one another head to head. If using Regenepure NT alongside Regepure DR however, Regepure easily wins out making your head as clear of DHT as possible while adding thickness, fullness and life to the hair. If I could only use Lipogaine Big 3 (which has no conditioner) OR Regenepure DR &amp; NT, I would choose the Regenepure Products. Good Luck and Keep up the good Fight against hair loss!</li>
    <li> My experience with this product is ok. I notice my hair feeling healtier from the first wash.the only bad thing is I notice more hair falling out when washing my hair. But besides that my hair looks better.</li>
    <li> Great product and service!</li>
    <li> It definitely helps to a degree, but this is no  miracle shampoo.  I would suggest grouping this with unrefined coconut oil and biotin pills.</li>
    <li> So so. You might have to use it for a few years to save a few hairs. Expensive for what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair thicker. Hard to go back to other brands</li>
    <li> Awesome shampoo and works as described</li>
    <li> Really surprised this is made by the same lab as the NT. I&#x27;m not impressed with this product. Doesn&#x27;t lather up well at all and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling clean and leaves hair very flat afterwards.  If you are intent on using it, I think following up with the NT is essential. The NT is wonderful, this, not so much. Lipo Big 3 is a better Ketoconazole shampoo imo. Alternating the Big 3 and Regenpure NT every other day is the way to go.</li>
    <li> When I could not find Nizoral shampoo in the stores, I searched for it on line, but it was SO expensive that I decided to give Regenpure, since it also contains ketoconazol and is MUCH less expensive. I&#x27;m glad I did. I am 100% satisfied with this shampoo. My head and hair feel wonderfully clean and fresh, without being overly dry. My hair comes out soft and shiny, yet my normally oily, itchy scalp is really clean. That oiliness contributes to the overgrowth of a type of yeast that feeds on lipids, I have learned, and has caused a decades long problem with itchy, burning, painful sores on my scalp. Tar shampoos, selsun blue, and other shampoos have had only limited success. This is the first product that heals the burn and with the pleasant side effect that my hair feels clean and full and soft. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> I have long, purple dyed hair that is thinning so I purchased this product after reading that shampoos with ketoconazole can help stop the thinning. The DR version of this shampoo brand is sulfate free so I selected this one because sulfate-free shampoos cause less stripping of hair dye. However, this shampoo barely lathers so I have to use a great deal of it to wash my hair and it stripped A LOT of color out. Enough so, that after one wash I will have to get my roots re-touched. I won&#x27;t purchase this shampoo again; I&#x27;ll use Nizoral which has a higher percentage of ketoconazole in it, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I will say, however, that the Renegepure Intense Volumizing Biotin Shampoo is fantastic. Although I can&#x27;t recommend this shampoo, I can highly recommend the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say this shampoo is causing hair growth since I&#x27;ve only used one bottle, but I love the formula. It has a cooling effect and lathers quite well. Makes my hair super shiny and manageable. It has also cured my dandruff problem.</li>
    <li> Made my scalp itch and burn even a full week after I stopped using it. Definitely didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> 2 bottle will see what happens so far so good!</li>
    <li> Best shampoo ever. Helped me keep and regrow any thinned out hairs. My heir is thick and healthy and I will never stop using this.</li>
    <li> Does not do anything  you will continue loosing your hair don&#x27;t waste your money like me that I used a lot</li>
    <li> I bought this product for the ketoconazole. I read about a study proving it helped regrow hair in lab rats, but with a 2% solution. This product is a 1% solution, however I do believe it is improving my hair quality overall. My hair has been shinier lately; I have had a few compliments the past few days aside from my own observations. But I also believe I&#x27;ve had less hair falling out and a thinning patch on my crown is starting to look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Nioxin before this because I had heard about it from several sources that it was the miracle shampoo that &amp;#34;helped cancer patients regrow their hair after chemo, so it must work wonders.&amp;#34; I was using it for about a month and felt a little discouraged, (aware it takes longer for hair to grow, but the product application itself wasn&#x27;t pleasant) and watched more product reviews and came across Regenepure in a Nioxin review YouTube vid. Satisfied with the results so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with this product is that, although this says 8oz bottle, I was sent two 4oz bottles (lol) and then a 3rd bottle with a &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; sticker.</li>
    <li> This treatment \\&quot;seems\\&quot; to be working.  I don&#x27;t seem to be losing the hair that I was and I have a lot of short hairs that I am hoping is new growth.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 6 or 8 weeks, usually 2 to 3 times per week.  It is not a shampoo, so it takes a few extra minutes to lather it up and wait before I can start my actual shampoo.  It does seem to be worth it though.  I initially ordered 2 bottles.  I&#x27;m still using the first.  At this point, I think I&#x27;ll reorder when the 2nd bottle runs out.  I am a female in my 60&#x27;s who takes hormone medicine. A lot of people have told me is probably the cause of my hair loss.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - plan on continuing to get more as bottles run out.</li>
    <li> Really great stuff! My initial concerns were that would this product smell awful like other medicated shampoos I&#x27;ve bought in the past for scalp issues. However, this product smells incredible and does a great job of cleaning and maintaining my scalp and making my hair feel thicker and fuller. I can&#x27;t quite speak on the results of hair loss regrowth since I&#x27;ve only used this product for less than a week, however the instant results of having thicker, fuller hair are immediately noticeable after the first wash. The mix of caffeine and spearmint in the product seem to wake me up a bit more in the morning, and keep my scalp + hair feeling clean all day. I&#x27;m REALLY happy I found a product that is made without parabens + sulfates and does the job that T-gel does, and even better than! Plus, if you use gel and/or hair spray to style your hair, this product seems to help your hair be a little more &#x27;rigid&#x27; rather than falling flat on your head, so you can style it a bit better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The niacin and spearmint might make your scalp tingle a bit but fades after a bit. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp feel all &#x27;dried out&#x27; afterwards either, and holds up well on smell and style, even on runs or when I sweat a lot. I would REALLY highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re using T-gel or similar anti-dandruff shampoos. This does an incredible job of doing what those shampoos do, and contain no sulfates, or parabens!</li>
    <li> Girlfriend and sister with hair problems swears by this</li>
    <li> I tried many products before finding regenepure shampoo. it was a revelation to me. it changed my life. My hair has stopped falling and they are growing back.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a month and a half now. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my scalp. I also like the fact that it is a Sulfate free shampoo, as I believe that Sulfate is harmful to my hair.</li>
    <li> Based on the popularity of this shampoo in the body building community, I purchased it along with the 2 other top sellers on Amazon.  I loved it so much that I ordered the Regenepure volumizing conditioner later.  Although it is too soon to determine the hair growth factor yet, but I can tell you for sure that it did stop hair shed!  It also made my hair look and feel fuller and thicker after the use.</li>
    <li> Rotten stuff.  Horrible for your hair. Don&#x27;t go near this crap. It makes your hair feel like paper. It tangles your hair so it cannot be combed.I would not use it on my dog. Try a real shampoo instead. ?...,...  I will not purchase it again. Infact I have a bottle to give away. May just pour it out.</li>
    <li> it works but it doesn&#x27;t grow hair.  I&#x27;been using it for a while now and noticed that it really works well to get of any dandruff. I wish it would lather up a bit more with a little more bubbles.  otherwise, it works as advertised in getting rid of dandruff.  no miracle hair growth, however.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions  for usage and after using a whole bottle, no results at all. Very disappointing. All the comments said this product was gonna help reduced hair loss and maybe regrow some hair but nope, I&#x27;m still losing at least 200+ hair each time I shower if not worst.</li>
    <li> The problem with this product is that it advertises (which is false) not artificial colors (among other things) on their website, I complained SEVERAL times about this as it says on their own bottle and under ingredients on the website FD&amp;C Blue #1 (which is an artificial color) which can cause MULTIPLE issues and are the underlying causes for many conditions. They now have taken that statement off their website (yet it would had been better for all us paying customers to remove the useless and harmless ingredient from the product instead)  Simply put there is NO reason WHATSOEVER to put this ingredient in as it does NOTHING beneficial to the product AT ALL APART FROM ****CAUSE**** more issues than it solves.  I have stopped buying the product until they wake up and realise this, why put useless and potentially harmful ingredients in their product when the product itself is MARKETED AND ADVERTISED for the very people trying so desperately to get AWAY from that stuff in the first place? ZERO BUSINESS SENSE AND COMMON SENSE. (Also from a business aspect it is an added cost for a useless and potentially harmful ingredient, no wonder so many businesses are going broke.....)</li>
    <li> Only used this product twice because I when I did my hair started shedding.  I wasn&#x27;t really experiencing any hairloss before, but I purchased this product as a preventivary measure. It left my hair feeling dry and led to a lot of shedding.</li>
    <li> This product does make your hair fuller, but really dries it out. I have been using a deep conditioner with it and still have really dry hair.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  It has only been a month but I see a dramatic improvement.</li>
    <li> Been using this product in combination with Rogaine foam for one month. I use it religiously, day and night. I typically rub it in for a few minutes vigorously and then let it set for 10 min or so while I shower. I think it&#x27;s made a drastic improvement. I will continue to use and highly recommend. I&#x27;ve included a one month before and after pic for review</li>
    <li> At the age of 60, I have tried numerous hair loss products. I began to notice a significant amount new hair growth within 30 days. By 90 days my hair appeared much fuller with a good amount of new hair growth. I had a substantial amount of hair loss on top of my head. To be clear, I still have thin and bald areas but the amount of regrowth has been good. I will continue to use Regenepure DR as the results are definitely positive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dr shampoo for almost 2 years now and it has really revitalized my hair. I have seborrheic dermatitis (inflammation of the scalp), which was causing itchiness, dandruff, rash, and consequently a lot of shedding. Using regenepure has really curbed the shedding and thickened my hair, not to mention my scalp feels much better. I would highly recommend giving it a shot if you suffer from scalp issues, hair shed/loss, balding, etc. The only minor complaint is that the shampoo does dry your hair out with extended use, so be sure to use a nice conditioner in conjunction (no sms, sulfate-free, paraben free).</li>
    <li> The lovely spearmint made my scalp &amp; testicles tingle! Superb shampoo!</li>
    <li> This product looks awfully suspicious the way it was shipped, and i&#x27;m not comfortable using it! It doesn&#x27;t look safe to me. The barcode sticker on the back is torn off, the label has not been placed on the product correctly (it looks like a poor relabeling attempt by hand) and something leaked on it because there is residue of a substance on the bottle itself and on the front label. The cap is also white, not blue/green like you see in the picture.    Here are the pics I took, see for yourself:  [...]  [...]</li>
    <li> if anything it seemed to make my hair thinner</li>
    <li> I take this in conjunction with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ONH0S8U/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems thicker and my nails grow fast now. I live in a high altitude city so my skin and nails and hair get dry. This keeps them healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I also take propecia twice a week and when I remember I will spray some minoxidil in my hair before bed. I think I can see a pretty good difference.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo a few months back at the earliest sign of hair loss. There are a lot of quality ingredients in it that put it a cut above what&#x27;s on the market today, including Ketoconazole- a medicinal ingredient known to reduce scalp inflammation and hair loss. When applying there is a satisfying &#x27;minty&#x27; &amp; tingling sensation that makes you feel the shampoo is working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately after months of use it has failed to prevent my hair loss from progressing... and my shedding rate has even dramatically increased. As far as being a cure/preventive measure to male pattern baldness, this is not it.  It did however cure my dandruff issues.</li>
    <li> Prefer Perfect Hair. This made my hair limp. I have fine hair.</li>
    <li> The best and only choise for your thinning hair.  The active ingredient for hairloss in this is  ketoconazole, which is the only ingrediate in existence thats known to HELP regrow hair.  Why this shampoo stands out from the others is because its main bulk ingredient is aloe, which is soothing.  Ketoconazole is harsh, especially if u want to use it daily.  This is why this shampoo is favored greatly to those that actually know a thing or two thing about hairloss, unlike the other moronic reviews ive seen on here.  Another important note:  Instead of sodium sulfate which is in most shampoos, again this has aloe.  So it doesnt make your hair look to thick, it kind of weighs it down.  I use this shampoo prior to my night time minoxdil application.  For a thickening shampoo use Tricomin with this. Its awesome for this reason.  If you want Ketoconazole and some thickness all in one, scratch this and buy Lipogains big 3 shampoo.  Best of luck guys!!</li>
    <li> shampoo is way overpriced for what it is and really doesnt work that well, and it makes my head extremely dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> Its not as good as nizoral and there is a lot of hype behind the marketing. Still a good shampoo, leaves the scalp feeling clean</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products to combat my thinning hair. I think that this has helped more than just about anything else. Lathers well, smells not too bad, and I honestly think my hair was beginning to shed less when I ran out. This is only my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Was extrememly upset when I started using this. I used it 3 times and my hair fell out even more. This is my first Amazon review, but after this happened I was devastated. I don&#x27;t know why it works for some but makes hair loss worse in others. Wasted my money and now have less hair. I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I would have loved to say that this stuff is the holy grail for hairloss but it isn&#x27;t so. it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, doesn&#x27;t lather well, made my scalp itch when I never had any itchy scalp or dandruff problems in my life and... It didn&#x27;t do what I purchased it for... Retard my hair loss.</li>
    <li> This is my go to for keto shampoo</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years now and after having isolated which products actually do work in the never ending battle against thinning hair/hairloss I have found that the ingredient found in this shampoo, Ketoconazole, seems to be the most effective ingredient with others, such as saw palmetto extract making this product easily stand above all other gimmicky &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; products promising the customer an unrealistic 15-year old&#x27;s head of vibrant healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product combined with a generic minoxidil product, such as Kirkland&#x27;s and/or Lipogaine, is a strong foundation for staving off the inevitable, which will be when you finally no longer care and turn it all loose. Regenepure DR is great alone, at least for me. I used the NT for a while, but quickly saw it as an unnecessary expense as the DR was doing plenty enough. I went through a test period lasting for about 6 months using an &amp;#34;all natural and herbal shampoo&amp;#34; by Avalon Organics, filled with saw palmetto, biotin, vitamins and no colorants, sulfates or other supposedly harmful ingredients and was alarmed at the rate of hair loss/thinning. I had been attempting a very clean, all natural, unique diet at the same time geared toward aligning one&#x27;s hormones to produce an environment beneficial for hair growth/restoration and even stopped taking minoxidil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t lie to you, minoxidil works and probably is the single most effective tool I&#x27;ve used thus far, but when combined with this shampoo my results were enhanced noticeably, only being subtle at first. I found that with this product and minoxidil I did not need any other products for hair growth, such as herbal DHT blockers, which I had been taking for 6 years. The blockers &amp;#34;seemed&amp;#34; to work, but I was off and on minoxidil the entire time I was on the blockers, which I think was the only thing that truly was working for me all a long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this industry thefocus is always on profits created through people&#x27;s fears, but I can assure you that with an established topical minoxidil fluid and Regenepure DR, you can rest assured that you are using some of the most financially accessible and powerful tools at your disposal. They simply work!</li>
    <li> Yes, you will see an initial shed period, but do not be alarmed. It is PERFECTLY NORMAL. I repeat, it will look like you&#x27;re losing a bunch of hair during the first week or so, but stay the course. The active ingredient in this bottle washes the DHT (what causes baldness) right off your scalp. I&#x27;ve been a loyal user now for 3 years and would not consider anything else. I only have a receding hairline and this has helped hault it in its tracks. It&#x27;s helped keep my hair thick and prevent any further hairloss. And since I have short hair, one bottle lasts at least a few months. When used with Rogaine, you&#x27;ll experience even better hair results.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really rate it any higher now. I&#x27;ve only been using this for about 2 weeks now. Hairloss is slightly advanced, so don&#x27;t really know how this&#x27;ll hold up for me. Will try to give my honest and most authentic review in about another month.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo because it seemed comparable to the Ovation Cell therapy.  It is incredibly damaging to my hair and requires extreme conditioning after each use.  I can&#x27;t yet see if there has been any improvement</li>
    <li> Smells minty.  Doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my skin at all.  Works nice!  The price is the downfall.  This is a seriously SMALL bottle for a +$25 shampoo</li>
