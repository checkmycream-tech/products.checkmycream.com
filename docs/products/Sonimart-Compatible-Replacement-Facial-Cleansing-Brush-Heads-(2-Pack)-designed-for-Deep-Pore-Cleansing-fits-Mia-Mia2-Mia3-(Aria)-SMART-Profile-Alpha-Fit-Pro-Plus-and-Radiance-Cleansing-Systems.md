<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> No problems so far. Softer and nicer bristles. My daughter likes them better than Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Mia 2. The heads work perfect. Thank you.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Fits my Clarisonic Plus perfectly.  Cleans well.  The bristles feel stiffer than my original Clarisonic head, but I think that&#x27;s probably because I now have the Deep Pore Cleansing Brush instead of the Sensitive Brush.  I would definitely recommend these and would buy them again.  You can&#x27;t beat the price. Clarisonic prices are ridiculous. ***UPDATE*** I&#x27;ve since purchased the Sensitive Skin brush. It&#x27;s just as stiff and rough as the Deep Pore brush. So, Clarisonic brushes are decidedly softer and preferable from that respect.  I haven&#x27;t been using my Clarisonic much lately in part because it&#x27;s a little rougher than I would like.  If the price were equal I would definitely choose Clarisonic. But, the price isn&#x27;t anywhere close to equal, so I don&#x27;t know.  I still might splurge for the real thing next time.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works very well, at a reasonable cost.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> they are gentle on my skin, and don&#x27;t cause any kind of irritation.</li>
    <li> These brush are very soft and fit my Clairsonic perfectly fine. The price is awesome compared to the Clairsonic brand.</li>
    <li> These are much less expensive than the Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
    <li> Loved this!  Arrived on time and works just as well as Clarisonic brand but at half the price!</li>
    <li> These replacements for the Clarisonic fit just fine, however my original head that had come with the Clarisonic was the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; one, and wanted a replacement that was a little more firm and deep cleansing. These replacement heads were much softer and than my old original head, so if you&#x27;re looking for a very gentle and softer cleanser head, this will work okay.</li>
    <li> Same quality as the original Clarisonic as far as the eye can tell</li>
    <li> I loved the price for this replacement!</li>
    <li> works like a charm...</li>
    <li> These brushes are awesome and fit perfectly on my Clarisonic Mia. I am so glad I found these replacement brushes at such a reasonable price, unlike the ones Clarisonic sells for $27. I will buy these again and again. This purchase was a lucky find!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying off-brand clarisonic brush heads for over a year and I&#x27;ve always been quite pleased with my purchase. Not this time. This was my first time ordering from Sonimart and I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. The brush heads are far too soft and not comparable at all. Mind you, I&#x27;ve been using knock off brush heads and they STILL don&#x27;t compare. I alternate a knock off brush head and a real Clarisonic brush head as a way to save money. I can honestly say that regardless of the low price of these brush heads, it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly in my Clarisonic Pro.  Very happy to find an affordable option for replacement brush heads!</li>
    <li> Works as well as Clarisonic brand. Attaches easily and works.  Packaged well.</li>
    <li> I recommend this over the original as it is much cheaper and and it provides the same level of performance</li>
    <li> Easy to attached. Compatible with Clarasonic!</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the fit for my Mia. These work very well.</li>
    <li> These may have slightly more softer bristles than the brand name.</li>
    <li> I think these work just as well as the brand name.</li>
    <li> The brush heads fit my sonic complexion brush perfectly. Very good choice. Proving you don&#x27;t always have to spend a lot to get quality!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with both the price and quality of these replacment brush heads.  Saves a ton of money and got the same quality as the originals.</li>
    <li> These brushes are better than the Clarisonics, these bristles are more delicate and will not hurt my face</li>
    <li> Just as great as the originals. I have the Mia 2 and these head fit perfectly, work great and are a fraction of the cost! Highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> I bought these replacement brushes for my Mia.  They fit perfectly are are exactly what I wanted.  Great find and great deal.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush head are soft without any rough edges.  I feel like I got the same quality of clean from these brush heads as I did with the name brand Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> I bought a twin pack and they are as good or better than the name brand brush head on my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
    <li> These work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads for a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s see...2 brushes for $10 or 1 for $25. This is a no-brainer. The Sonimart brushes are wonderful although they don&#x27;t fit as snugly as the Sonicare ones thus these vibrate and are a bit noisier. The&#x27;re fine, though. I most certainly will buy them again,.</li>
    <li> a great alternative to the higher priced name brand brush.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found these brushes. They feel amazing on the skin are as great at the original Mia brushes that will cost you $25 per replacement. This is a deal you cannot beat. You get 2 for only $10!!! I will be purchasing again. Thanks! I have recommended these brushes to all the ladies and subscribers on my blog IG page for my blog. Check it out also at www.pinkluxpl.blogspot.com.</li>
    <li> The price is right for a try and it didn&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
    <li> Sorry but I don&#x27;t see the difference in these compared to the originals except the price.  These may even be just a a tab bit softer on my skin. Fits perfectly and works great.  This is my second purchase and if my clarisonic continues to work- I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the name brand, but work just as well and fit my Mia 2 perfectly!</li>
    <li> There is hardly any difference between these and the Clarisonic brand.</li>
    <li> Works  just as good  as my clarisonic brushes</li>
    <li> This product works just fine and fits right into clarisonic with no problem.</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Comparable product to sonicare brand at fraction of the price.  However, next time I will order for sensitive skin rather than deep cleanse as theses are a bit too stiff for my delicate skin.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of these replacement heads. They work as advertised and are a great bargain.</li>
    <li> It works and feels just like the original brush head.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These are pretty nice and they fit my Clarisonic fine so no complaints there, however, other generic brands have bigger sets of like 4 or 6 replacement heads a pack and I wish this did the same so I could save some $$$ buying bulk.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would pay the extra money for the Clairsonic brushes. I bought the deep pore cleaning brush and I actually think it works better than the one that came with my original purchase.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly. I read reviews of other aftermarket products that seemed to have fit issues, but this one is a perfect match and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> There is hardly any difference between these and the expensive Clarisonic brush heads. I will be back!</li>
    <li> Instead of splurging thirty bucks on one Clarisonic brush head, splurge thirty bucks on six of these Sonimart brush heads instead! These brush heads are absolutely indistinguishable to the original and actually is better, considering that the Sonimart brush heads are less than fraction of the price to the original Clarisonic brush heads. PLEASE BUY THESE or at least try them. These brush heads are no different to the original and can save you a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Fits my Mia 2 perfectly and works well. Will purchase again in future.</li>
    <li> These brushes heads work perfectly with my Clarisonic Plus.</li>
    <li> Great purchase! Could not tell a difference between the Clarisonic brush and this one. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s just as good as the original and a fraction of the price. Buying again!</li>
    <li> I will be purchasing them again as soon as it is time to replace my current head (on my Clarisonic duh!)</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product!  It works great and I received mine quickly.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure but for the price definitely wasn&#x27;t easy afraid to gamble and get it a try. But now I am glad that I have purchased it from this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now used them for a few months and have noticed absolutely no difference between this brand and the Clarisonic brand. The only major difference is again the cost which is dramatically much more affordable. Don&#x27;t waste your money on expensive brushes!! These work great!</li>
    <li> I was worried it would not fit my Mia 2, It fits and still left my face feeling clean and refreshed. I will be buying these again.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, fits perfectly on my Mia 2.</li>
    <li> The Sonimart facial brushes are fine-----I had thought they would be a little bit firmer/tougher on the face than they are, but my face is&lt;br /&gt;clean and they remove the makeup and leave my skin clean.</li>
    <li> Great product and priced right within my budget.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Like the price and quality</li>
    <li> Fits perfect with my clarisonic Mia 2. Bristles are nice. Great value.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with the fit for my Mia. These work very well.</li>
    <li> The price cannot be beat</li>
    <li> For the price, these are REALLY good and I will continue to buy them over the more expensive Clarisonic heads.</li>
    <li> I got tired of paying a lot of money for the name brand brushes and tried the refurbished  ones that fell apart. Went on Amazon to search for some and found these brushes with 5 star reviews. Decided to try them and love them. They will be my new supplier. If you are undecided, they are definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> at a fraction of the price this is a great alternative if the name brand is too much for a thrifty budget.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in these brushes and the ones from Clarisonic, except for the great price</li>
    <li> These are great brushes for the clairsonic, feel just the same</li>
    <li> Fits the Clarisonic Mia 2, as advertised. The bristles are softer than the Clarisonic version, so I would assume that if the brushes really do what they say (Deep Pore cleansing) these would not have the same effect. That being said, my skin was a little irritated, so the softer brush was a relief. Also, over the past 2 years I&#x27;ve replaced my brush head every 3 months, as suggested, and always with a Clarisonic brush head. I&#x27;ve used 3 different versions- deep pore, sensitive, &amp; acne- and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all in the results, so I&#x27;m not convinced that the different texture/bristle length really matter.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for the money.  The brushes aren&#x27;t quite as hard as the name brand, so you have to use your clarisonic a little longer to get a deep clean feeling but these work just fine.  I will definitely order again - very quick delivery, also.</li>
    <li> Very good. Cannot tell the difference between this and the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Great product and value!!</li>
    <li> These brush heads are a great value for the quality.  They feel very durable and I would buy them again.</li>
    <li> What a great value these are!  They are excellent quality and worked great with my Clarisonic Mia.</li>
    <li> These may have slightly more stiff bristles than the brand name. Works/fits perfectly.</li>
    <li> The price was perfect but it did make me wonder if it was of low quality or even if it fit.  I took a chance and am very happy I did.  Cleans wonderfully and I am not disappointed.</li>
    <li> fits well on my Mia 2, used only a few times. So far, it&#x27;s been great.</li>
    <li> Very good!  Just like the Clarisonic brand only a lot cheaper😊</li>
    <li> works great at a much lower price. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads fit my Clarisonic perfectly, and I&#x27;ve not experienced any difference in the way they perform in comparison to the hugely expensive ones.  Will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> OEM brushes are too expensive and Im glad there is a perfect match at a great price. It fit perfect and works great</li>
    <li> Thank you offering such a great product for Clarisoinc!</li>
    <li> I bought a 2 pack and they are as good or even better than the original brush head on my Clarisonic Mia. I love these!</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time and as described.</li>
    <li> I switched from sensitive skin brushes, they are great</li>
    <li> These brush are very soft and fit my Clairsonic perfectly fine.  I would not hesistate to buy them again.</li>
    <li> Love these!  Much cheaper and I feel they are a little more exfoliating, which I like.  I will definitely buy these again!!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my Clarisonic, a very reasonable priced replacement.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t think of looking here for third party versions of the Clarisonic brushes.  I spent $100 or so on one year of use by buying a name brand brush every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, this next year will only cost me $20 in total for 4 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose and face feel the same as they did for the last month but for far less money.  Good build quality.</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my Mia 2 and I&#x27;ve had no issues with it!</li>
    <li> These are just as good as the ones you purchase in the store, though much less expensive. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Brushes feel and look the same as the originals and they both fit perfectly in the Mia</li>
    <li> These brushes are great and fit my prized Mia perfectly!</li>
    <li> Purchased these to replace my brush heads on my Clarisonic and they&#x27;re great thus far</li>
    <li> Fit well and affordable priced. Good quality.</li>
    <li> I cant tell the difference. Both brushes feel and look the same and they both fit perfectly in the Mia</li>
    <li> I bought these for my clarisonic, a very reasonable priced replacement.</li>
    <li> Fits great and they do do not make anymore noise than the originals. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> It works fine, but the bristles are not as firm as I would have liked.  They feel softer than the Clarisonic head I use.</li>
    <li> Very close to Clarisonic brushes. Slight rattle during use but performs just as well as Clarisonic. For the price: will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase, it fits without problem for half or more of the regular cost.  will definitely buy again.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My delicate brush head purchased is awesome!  It fits my Clarisonic Mia perfectly and works just like I remember the Clarisonic brush heads to!</li>
    <li> Works great and such a super value!!!!</li>
    <li> You really do not see the difference in Sonimart&#x27;s product and the Clarisonic bristles. Oh my, I forgot to say: the only difference is the great price!</li>
    <li> I bought a twin pack and they are as good or better than the name brand brush head on my Mia.</li>
    <li> Will continue to buy these.  Excellent substitute and great price.  Work perfectly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous!! How did I not find these sooner?????</li>
    <li> They are the exact same as the $25 replacements for my clarisonic mia except the price was great and the head was a little softer.</li>
    <li> i highly recommend the product as its just like the name brand!</li>
    <li> These work great and fit great with my Mia 2</li>
    <li> The brush heads work just the same as the OEM! I had no problem with them fitting onto my Clarisonic Aria!</li>
    <li> This product works great, fits right into my Aria from Clarisonic with no problems.</li>
    <li> Just like name brand brush heads, aweseome value!</li>
    <li> Fits great and they do do not make anymore noise than the name brand heads. I will buy these again!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I buy this copy Clarisonic brushes and I love them!! I have owned the name brand brushes also but they are just way to expensive to keep up with. I would defenetly recommend this product, they fit my Clarisonic perfectly just like the name brands</li>
    <li> Fits perfectly on my Clarisonic and couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between these copy ones from the $25 heads.  So worth it!</li>
    <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give these a try. I&#x27;m VERY happy that I did! You&#x27;d never know the difference between Sonimart Brushes and the actual Clarisonic Brand brushes. The other wonderful thing is the price: One Clarisonic Brand brush was costing me about $25.00. Sonimart provides two brushes and it&#x27;s much less. Will definitely buy more and I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Just replaced my old brush and this fit my Aria just fine and feels great. I loved the price for this replacement!</li>
    <li> It might be a generic but it does the job without paying the hefty price. Thank you making such a great product!</li>
    <li> They work well in my clarisonic.</li>
    <li> These are much less expensive than the Clarisonic replacement heads.</li>
    <li> It works just like the name brand!</li>
    <li> So freakin&#x27; worth it over the more expensive heads by Clarisonic!  $25 for a name brand head?  Sorry, but that is just unreasonable for such a product.  This is a much better bargain and I could barely tell the difference other than the heads were a little softer.</li>
    <li> I bought this copy item and guess what?! it works just like the name brand!</li>
    <li> I recommend this over the name brand as it is much cheaper and same performance</li>
    <li> Name brand brushes are too expensive and Im glad there is a perfect match at a great price. It fit perfect and works great</li>
    <li> I cant tell the difference. Both brushes feel and look the same and they both fit perfectly on the Mia2</li>
    <li> These work exactly the same as the Clarisonic brush heads for a fraction of the price! Great product and value!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! Popped right onto my Clarisonic Mia with no problems.  A much less expensive option that works well; will definitely reorder when it comes time.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Much cheaper than the OEM, but work just as well and fit my Mia 2 perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have only been using these for about a week, but so far I love them! I was hesitant about not buying the clarisonic brand because I was afraid they would not fit quite right. However, it locks into place without an issue. I will be purchasing these again.</li>
    <li> This brush leaves my skin feeling so fresh and clean!  Fits perfectly on my clarisonic.  Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I feel super lucky to have found these! I adore my Clarisonic but the brushes are too expensive on my current budget. These fit perfectly and are working great.</li>
    <li> I came across these replacement brush heads while looking for a less expensive option then the original brush heads. I read over many reviews. I ended up right back here and made my purchase. It is always a gamble when you purchase something unseen not in person...no way to touch it to see if it a good quality product. I am not a lucky person but I took the gamble and ordered. I hit the jackpot on these! They work just as the originals which are more than twice the price for only one brush head. Here you get two! Try them! You will not be disappointed! I will purchase from this company again as not only are the brush heads an awesome deal but I feel better knowing I am supporting a small homegrown American business!</li>
    <li> This product works great, fits right into the clarisonic mia with no problem.</li>
    <li> I have to admit, I was skeptical to try an off-brand brush head.  So glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality product!  Fits perfectly on my Clarisonic!  And, wow, the price is very reasonable!</li>
    <li> Thought this wouldn&#x27;t work but really glad it does and at a fraction of the cost of the major brand.</li>
    <li> Great brushes, fits great on my Mia 2.</li>
    <li> These are much less expensive than the Clarisonic replacement heads but nearly as good.</li>
    <li> They are offered at fair price and I will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> I bought these heads as a replacement for my Clarisonic. I decided to go with the deep clean after wanting to try this type of head. Now I will say, I have not tried the Clarisonic version of this brush. So because of that, I can&#x27;t give it a full 5 stars as I have nothing to compare it to. But I will say that these fit on my Mia 2 perfectly. I don&#x27;t have any weird sounds or anything like that. I do believe these are a comparable product, and for that I&#x27;m grateful. I may purchase these again in the future, after trying the regular brush heads, but in the meantime, these two should last me for the next six months.</li>
    <li> good. no issues - performs exactly like the name brand.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic!  I would say almost identical to the clairsonic at a fraction of the price.  Because I found these, I will be buying my 11 year old daughter a clairsonic for her birthday.  I could not justify spending all that money on replacement brush heads for her, but now that I found these, its not a problem.  I will continue to use these, myself, and will never buy the clairsonic again!</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Met expectations.</li>
    <li> These are awesome replacement heads for my Clarisonic Mia.  They are easy to install and works just as well if not better than the Clarisonic brand brush heads and the Sonimart price is soooooo much better.  After using these brush heads my face is smooth and clean, but not irritated in any way.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Fast shipping!!! A+++</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it met and exceeded expectations.  Will order again</li>
    <li> Fit my Sonicare perfectly but much cheaper than their replacement heads</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the ones by Clarisonic, and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> The brush heads work just the same as the name brand!!!</li>
    <li> great price and works great for me.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality just like the original more expensive brand.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my Clarasonic Mia..thank you ! Great price!</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes for the Clarisonic system</li>
    <li> These are a perfect fit for Clarisonic</li>
    <li> I will be purchasing them again as I was very impressed with these!</li>
    <li> These brush heads work great.  They fit my Clarisonic perfectly and don&#x27;t make any excessive noise or unwanted vibration.  Gone are the days of paying way too much money for brush heads.  Support an American company that does a great job with quality manufacturing and purchase these products.</li>
    <li> I ordered the regular brush heads for myself and was so pleased with the quality I ordered these for a friend. They are perfectly compatible with my Clarisonic and perform exactly like the ridiculously overpriced brush heads sold by Ulta. I will NEVER pay $27 for a single brush head again!!</li>
    <li> these heads are very gentle on my skin and make it feel rejuvinated</li>
    <li> Excellent product; I notice no difference between these and the Clarisonic brand.  Excellent price, quick delivery, good packaging.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It fits my clarisonic perfect and it cleans my face just as well the clarisonic brushes! Love the price of course.. Will buy again from this company!</li>
    <li> excellent product and seller!</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned that these replacement brushes wouldn&#x27;t fit my clarisonic mia 1. They fit just fine! They are a little softer than the original, even softer than the original set I purchased for sensitive skin. For this price, you can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
    <li> Great product. Works exactly the same as the name brand at a fraction of the cost. Arrived on time and nicely packaged. I ordered Two different kinds because the price was so good. Thank you!</li>
    <li> For the price, they are great!! Same design and fit as the Clarisonic replacements for the Mia 2 but without the hefty price tag.</li>
    <li> Very high quality, I was expecting less at first, so this was quite a pleasant surprise as we typically use the Clarisonic heads, but now may consider swithcing to this one</li>
    <li> So very pleased with the quality of these replacement brushes!  I was ordering them from a home shopping channel and their price was exorbitant!  It fits perfectly in my Clarisonic Mia and works just like the original.  I am so happy to have found this product.   It also arrived before promised date.  I would definitely order again from this seller.</li>
    <li> These work great! I don&#x27;t know why anyone would pay more.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are just as good if not better than the named brand brushes at half of the cost. I stopped using my Mia2 because I ran out of the brushes and couldn&#x27;t afford to pay 20.00 per brush head at the named brand price. I found these cheaper but equal in quality brushes and purchased 4 for the price of what I would have paid for 1 brush. That math works out great for me. I&#x27;ve used the Mia2 everyday since I got the brushes.</li>
    <li> Identical to the much more expensive named brand brush head and it fit my Clarisonic Mia perfectly. I see and feel no difference and I am a bit of a perfectionist!</li>
    <li> Cleans my face just like Clarisonic head did</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Identical to clarisonic but without the crazy expensive price tag.  These will be my go to brushes from now on.</li>
    <li> These feel more stratchy to me than the real ones.  The spin with no issue but the quality and positioning of the of the bristles is not as good.</li>
    <li> Love it, fits and works great</li>
    <li> I WAS IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY AND PRICE!  THE SONIMART IS EQUAL IN QUALITY TO MY CLARISONIC BRUSHES.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE SONIMART BRUSHES IN THE FUTURE.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, price is perfect too. Thanks, for the great service.</li>
    <li> I really like these!  I have used the clarsonic pro for years but brushes and product are pricey.  In my opinion, these are as good as the clarsonic brushes.  I was very happy with the entire transaction.  Good delivery time. Decent Packaging!</li>
    <li> Very nice item that fits my Clarisonic</li>
    <li> I love my Clarisonic Mia2. Unfortunately, I found the brush replacements to be very pricey. These clean just like the original brushes for much less.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the ones by Clarisonic and they work perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the sonimart replacement brush head and the expensive Clarisonic. Would definitely purchase this again and recommend to friends!</li>
    <li> Very nice item that fits my Clarisonic</li>
    <li> I own a Clarisonic Mia and the replacement brushes are pretty expensive. I tried your brushes and they work just as efffective as the Clarisonic brushes.  I will definitely be ordering them again.</li>
    <li> So worth it over the more expensive heads by Clarisonic!</li>
    <li> Works great with my clarisonic mia. It&#x27;s definitely a bargain considering the other name brand ones run $26 for just one.</li>
    <li> I was very encouraged by all the positive reviews of these replacement brush heads.  I was really hoping to have found a cheaper alternative to the brand named ones that cost $27 each.  Unfortunately, as is usually the case, you get what you pay for.  These are, contrary to all the positive reviews, NOTHING like the brand name brush heads.  They are flimsy and cheaply made, and will likely fall apart in relatively short order.  I could tell they were not as good as &amp;#34;the real thing&amp;#34; right out of the box, they&#x27;re  lighter and just don&#x27;t feel as solid.  I attached one to my device and turned it on and you could actually hear the center part rattling around.  Nope, they&#x27;re back in the box and going back tomorrow.  I already stopped at the store and bought a duo pack of the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; and am so glad I did.  Don&#x27;t bother with these.  Buy the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; and take good care of them and they&#x27;ll last you longer than the recommended 3mos and be far economical in the long run than these cheap knockoffs.</li>
    <li> Similar quality to the Clarisonic brand brushes. Can&#x27;t even tell the difference!</li>
    <li> Works great! Glad I bought these as they are adorable and work wonderful with my mia! Will definitely be purchasing again. A great, affordable, comprable replacement head!</li>
    <li> Save your money and definitely purchase these instead of the $25 Clarisonic heads!</li>
    <li> These work perfect with my Mia. Five stars</li>
    <li> The brush heads fit and work just like the ones that came with my Aria</li>
    <li> I cant tell the difference. Both brushes feel and look the same and they both fit perfectly in the Mia</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than the ones by Clarisonic, yet they work perfectly.  Five Stars</li>
    <li> Works just are great as the brand name, if not better! Would repurchase!</li>
    <li> It works and feels just like the name brand brush head at half the price.</li>
    <li> There is hardly any difference between these and the expensive Clarisonic brush heads.</li>
    <li> Fits on the Clarisonic Mia perfectly.  As well made as the original!</li>
    <li> These may have slightly more stiff bristles than the brand name</li>
    <li> Compatible with Clarsonic and just as high quality for less money. Still both products are prob. made overseas like everything else.</li>
    <li> If you didn&#x27;t know this wasn&#x27;t an actual clairisonic Mia 2 brush head you would not be able to tell! I gave my mom (the non believer) the second one &amp;even she was impressed! I will continue to get my replacements from Sonismart!!!</li>
    <li> bought as a gift, works well and fits the Mia.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kind of a snob when it comes to skincare products and their legitimacy, but I genuinely couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between these brushes and the name brand.</li>
    <li> These exfoliate the pores on  my face and leave me with that fresh and clean feeling, absolutely fantastic and I would defintetly buy them again!</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the Sonicare brand. Definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love these for use at home!  The vibration or watever is like the originals.</li>
</ol>
