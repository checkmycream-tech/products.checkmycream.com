      <li>Easy to use, nice .</li>

      <li>Make sure all the strands in one section are smoothed out before putting this on or you&#x27;ll have a curl made of tangles.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Could pay more, but why.  These work very well to curl hair.  Didn&#x27;t have to blow dry first to achieve a desired look.</li>
    <li> These are as described.  Easy to use, sleep in and produce sweet curls.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> These rollers curled hair just like the curlformers at Sally&#x27;s. These were inexpensive. All of the rollers were fine, I did not find anything wrong with any of them. I read a previous review. I would definitely recommend them if you want to save money and get SAME results.</li>
    <li> I have been contemplating buying the actual Curlformers after watching several youtube videos on them, but that staggering price was really holding me back.  So i bought these instead hoping they were a good alternative. Annnnd I was right.  Just youtubed &amp;#34;knockoff curlfomers&amp;#34; and watched a few reviews and they are basically the same thing.  Good investment if you cant afford $50 for a pack of 40 curlformers.  I bought 2 packs and paid $20 some odd dollars and thinking about getting another pack.</li>
    <li> Exactly as image shows, all the curlers were in good shape. No damage or bad odor. Works great, and the wand isn&#x27;t cheap and flimsy.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good.....had to buy a second set to be able to do my whole head...the only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the wand it is kinda flimsy</li>
    <li> I was a disappointed that the curlers weren&#x27;t very well made. I bought two different sizes. The orange and pink package were well made. The blue and green curlers had one defective curler and many others that weren&#x27;t in good shape. I should have returned them.</li>
    <li> Good quality product. They arrived very quickly. They exceeded my expectations, and they were very easy to use. No harsh smells like the other postings.</li>
    <li> I only had a few curlwrs that were defective. they work very well. The stick might need  be reinforced with some tape but it still works on my thick hair.</li>
    <li> great for transitioners wanting curls. takes practice but works once you get the hang of it. Kinda time consuming 1- 1 1/2hrs, Im kinda slow though. The key to doing this correctly is having enough of these things (about 40 formers) and taking small chunks of hair 1/2&amp;#34; or 1&amp;#34; sections. My hair is super thick in the middle and I almost broke the rod (the hook bent). Now I&#x27;m doing smaller sections and not having this issue. Good luck ladies</li>
    <li> This is a generic version and the results were amazing, I would definitely recommend these to anyone wanting to try the less expensive brand</li>
    <li> I ordered this and the picture shows that it comes with a hook but when i recieved it there was no hook. Very Dissapointed.</li>
    <li> I used these for my daughters hair - she was a flower girl in a wedding.  I only purchased the small set from Sally&#x27;s and I made them work but really needed a few more.  I also wanted to try them on my hair - for mine I have ordered two sets from Amazon.  My hair is ridiculously thick and curly.  However I wanted to try these and I honestly love them!!! For my little girl whose hair is fine I normally spritz her hair with water place the curl former&#x27;s in and let it dry.  If we are in a hurry I will use a hair bonnet attached to a blow dryer - only takes 10 minutes or less.  This is the ONLY thing I have found that will keep a curl in her hair with the added bonus of no heat damage.  These are well worth the money if bought from Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> Does the job perfectly! produces very well defined curls. And its very easy to use. I love it! great also on natural hair :-)</li>
    <li> Great way to curl your hair without the heat!  My daughter and I used them and slept in them.  They weren&#x27;t bad to sleep in and great curls in the AM.</li>
    <li> Love them , work well and very much better than I expected.  A littile tricky at first.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the spiral curl is NOT held all day as I would like :(&lt;br /&gt;but Curlformers help give my hair the illusion of length - yay!!</li>
    <li> When I ordered these they were supposed to be a short length and they can in long instead. They were pretty when I put them in my head but the style didn&#x27;t come out completely right.</li>
    <li> I have recently gone natural and when I used the product my hair was due for a serious trim. After using them I noticed my ends needed some tlc. The curls were okay but I think they would have come out better if my ends were clipped, my hair was longer and I used another product. However, I really like the curl formers because it stretches out my hair and gave it an interesting curl. I bought the smaller kind because my hair is short and a little thin so I figured I would benefit from getting smaller curls. My hair is now longer and stronger and I am hoping that the curls will turn out better when I use them in the future. Oh! I also slept in them and they were extremely uncomfortable. They pulled on my hair and I had to sleep pretty (Which I am use to doing from my sew-in days).</li>
    <li> So glad I bought these. The value is great compared to the price at the local beauty supply store. They were fairly easy to use after watching a few videos on YouTube.</li>
    <li> These work really well and have some lovely curls. although it&#x27;s difficult to sleep in them, I do like how my hair looks when I&#x27;m all done.</li>
    <li> I really like them. They five me tje look I want without the heat but the curls don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I bought this product assuming it was a similar size to the long and narrow curl formers . But I would say the curl is more like the long and wide ones. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the colors like I was! But overall all but one of my curl formers were perfect. The closer at the end of the damaged one was coming loose. Easy to put in/take out. As long as you are holding the closer open when putting them in you shouldn&#x27;t have too much trouble getting your hair through.</li>
    <li> Had to look at a You Tube tutorial to know exactly what I was doing; after a while  I was able to get the hang of it. it took about an hour to do, which I didn&#x27;t mind. the only negative thing I have to say about these curlers is that they really aren&#x27;t that comfortable to sleep in, but the results are GREAT!!! I have thick hair and I rarely use heat on my hair so these curlers were perfect for me!!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome for curling your hair! There is a learning curve to using them but there are lots of online videos that help, my hair never holds curls for more than 2-3 hours and this held ALL day! Works even better than heat curlers!</li>
    <li> Came on time! Have not used of yet(Just did bantu knots for recent interviews), but looks great and is as described! I&#x27;ve been waiting for a while to order these. So Glad I did. Came with hook and cute little clear bag!</li>
    <li> I started to go natural for about 6 1\2 months. I bought the Curlformers from Sally Beauty for $70 (Yikes!! I know...) and I needed some more curlformers for my hair. I bought them &amp; they were way cheaper (Yay!). I use the Sally&#x27;s pink &amp; orange for the front of my hair, and use the green &amp; blue for the back of my hair since it&#x27;s longer. They give me great results in the end, and it works for all hair types :-)</li>
    <li> These are a cool little curlers but they are not for black hair. I thought that they would help to define my curls since I have different textures of hair on my head but they didn&#x27;t. Also, they take forever to put in and out so it&#x27;s not really worth the time. I haven&#x27;t tried them with my hair straighten. The quality of them are nice. Seller got them to me quickly.</li>
    <li> The curlers and wand arrived earlier than expected and worked perfectly (I have the pink and orange pack too). They did not come with instructions but I already researched the product online. Anyone looking for an inexpensive alternative to the name brand Curlformers would do well to purchase these curlers. I&#x27;ve used them at least five times and I get excellent results each time. The trick is twisting the hair at the root first and then pulling it through. Also, I noticed dramatically different results when I changed how much hair I put in each curler and using the curlers on dry hair versus wet hair. I have relaxed hair--using these curlers when wet gives me the best results. After you get used to using them, you will begin to figure out which way to place the curl formers on the hook so the curl goes in the direction where you want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: It is possible to pull out strands of your hair with these curlers if you pull too hard. My suggestion is to just push the wand back through and start over. There are some great videos on YouTube that show the process, just search for Curlformers videos.</li>
    <li> I had one curlformer that was missing the rubber on the end.  That why I gave four stars.  Overall I was satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I had used the orange and pink curlers before and loved them so I decided to buy these. The first time I used them they were very difficult to put in and were so uncomfortable to sleep in unlike the orange and pink ones. Then when I took them out I looked like Shirley Temple! And I have long hair. I was not satisfied.</li>
    <li> These are the best things ever if your a cheer mom - or someone who loves to have curly hair with little work.  For curls to last all day - sleep with these in.  You can leave them in for about 3 hrs if you are just wanting a curly look for the afternoon.  They are pretty quick to get in your hair &amp; easy to remove.  Just takes time figuring out if you should do this with wet hair / wet hair with a little spray in gel / or dry hair - just depends on the person.  1 have 2 sets for my daughter.  This is what our entire cheer gym uses.  Cheaper that Sally&#x27;s beauty supply that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> Works great for heat less curling. Do not place formers on wet or damp hair because the hair will not dry while formers are on. Works on a wide variety of hair textures and is easy to apply. Be careful the rod can be caught on the hair so do take your time applying and taking down. Overall the product works and leaves my hair and others hair curly and bouncy. Just remember to spray hair spray on your hair after taking the formers off or the curls will not stay bouncy for long.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, nice . It creates very nice curlers. Better than all the rollers i had before. Go for it.</li>
    <li> I got the pack with both medium and short, thinking that the short would do my semi bangs(that go down to my chin)... however the medium ones wern&#x27;t even long enough for my bangs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO I bought these long curlers and now I don&#x27;t even need to use the other pack.  They arn&#x27;t always easy to put on my hair gets caught sometimes, but I&#x27;d much prefer these compared to regular curling rolls.  I didn&#x27;t even need to use all of them for my whole head (although I do have thin hair), I only used all the blue, and maybe one or 2 of the green. They are semi comfortable to sleep on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use them it has this slight plasticy smell, however after using it a couple times I don&#x27;t really notice it anymore.  My hair turns out fun and curly just how I want it.  I don&#x27;t like putting chemicals in my hair so I&#x27;m a minimum hairspray kind of person, and thankfully they actually hold the curl for a good 5 hours with a tiny bit of hair spray, I would assume they would hold a many hours with more hair spray if you don&#x27;t mind using a lot.</li>
    <li> I Love this Product. I am an African American female with medium length relaxed hair. I love roller sets on my hair, especially  rod sets.  Unfortunately I can not do a rod set on my own hair, but then when I heard about these!! OMG!!!!!!!!!! I fell in love with the outcome of the curls but I really fell in love when i discovered how easy it is to put them in MYSELF. Anyway I brought this product for the front of my head and I brought the wide ones (the pink &amp; orange) for the back. My product was not defected and I am overall satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I purchased these along with High speed changing hair curlers as a bundle pack. They both work great. They were shipped in one box but packaged separately. This packed did not send a full wand, they sent two hook ends and no bottom end of the wand. Luckily the other package sent two wands with its&#x27; rollers. Great product for WAY less than the original curl formers cost in Sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> The wand snags on your hair at times and some of the formers are not wide enough for the wand, but I just went and bought the wand the goes with the curlformers they sell at sallys (not expensive) and didn&#x27;t have the problem anymore. Overall a good product the wand is just not the best. You get a lot for your your money, a lot cheaper than the $65.&lt;br /&gt;curlformers from sally&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These were too long so I cut them in half and burned the the end with a lighter cause I didn&#x27;t want to send them back. They are also flimsy and too long for the stick.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not contain this product to get open and the hook did not come. I lost my money because the only suggestion is to send it back and I get to return more expensive than what you pay for the product.</li>
    <li> Damaged my hair horribly. Ripped my hair on insertion and removal. Do not buy if you have fine hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Vakind curlers in extra long and wide before and I was very pleased, however since I&#x27;ve cut all my processed hair off, I wanted to use the narrow version while I grow out again. These are not as narrow as the Curlformer brand, so I basically bought a different color set of what I already had.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and did a great job. the curls were soft and held up good even after brushing</li>
    <li> The picture and the real product are not matched. In the picture you may see several turning for a long hair and in th reality its only one turn for a short hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked me to get a set of these for her hair and since the last time I tried curling I got burned with the curling iron (and have some pretty nightmarish memories of getting perms as a kid) I decided to go for it and see if they worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some trial and error (if you are new to the whole &amp;#34;CurlFormer&amp;#34; thing, DEFINITELY go to YouTube and check out the videos) we figured it out- the trick is to have slightly damp hair and do the curls in small, well-combed segments. I will admit that I was hoping we could get huge segments of hair into each curler but they aren&#x27;t made that way- you have to do little sections in each curler, so it does take time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, lo and behold, when we were done she had a beautiful head of bouncy curls. She was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, these aren&#x27;t quick. It took well over an hour to get all her hair into the curlers once we got the process down. And they aren&#x27;t comfortable, but very few curlers are (I have memories of sleeping in those bendable foam sticks in high school). But they do work very well, if you are patient and don&#x27;t mind the time it takes to get the curlers in.</li>
    <li> Pretty fast shipping. Just as good as the actual product so far. Curls don&#x27;t seem super tight but they&#x27;re easier to sleep in than I thought.</li>
    <li> They worked great!  I loved the way my daughter&#x27;s natural hair looked and felt after using this product.  And it works just as well as the name band ones.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this product on her hair and she loves it.  She hold last a long time and she loves it.</li>
    <li> after using only once, already two of them ripped at the end of the curl formers.  Also, the item came in a black plastic bag without any product package nor instruction.  I started wondering if the product is illegitimate.  I trust that Amazon does their homework to make sure no such sellers allowed like other infamous websites.  I am a cyber shopper and love to get great deals.  that is why I like to shop at Amazon.com.  but I never want to buy anything for any price from an illegal sellers.</li>
    <li> These were exactly what I was looking for and there were plenty of them to do my thick long hair!</li>
    <li> I like this curl forming. Used on my daughter. Her curly hair was not sickened toothed end but the  .  WWere Shirley temple bouncy.</li>
    <li> Just received the Green and Blue curlformers and they are the SAME size as my Orange and Pink ones that I purchased from Vakind. Do not purchase these if you think they are smaller than the Orange and Pink.</li>
    <li> I would suggest using a mousse or gel to get a smooth curl. Make sure all the strands in one section are smoothed out before putting this on or you&#x27;ll have a curl made of tangles. And that is no fun at all.</li>
    <li> I realize that these aren&#x27;t the original, more expensive curl formers but some directions on how to put them on would have been VERY useful. Fortunately, I did some research on YouTube and after several attempts, I got it...I wanted to coax my already curly hair into big, smooth spirals but all I got were big balls of hair curled tightly to my head! LOL I&#x27;ve seen it work beautifully and create gorgeous styles on others but it just wasn&#x27;t for my hair....</li>
    <li> love these. However im very disappointed in the blue and green set.. I have the pink and orange set originally and im very pleased with them..so I wanted to get the blue and green set as well for smaller curls..wrong! they are exact same size with less curlers in them u get 24 curlers in this pack and in the pink and orange u get 40! for same size! don&#x27;t waste ur money and avoid buyn this set and get orange and pink set! more curlers. half tempted to return this set I dont need more the same size..apart from that I would of gave 4 stars</li>
    <li> Good quality. I had no problem with the hook. No snagged hairs. I have a lot of hair so I could have done with a couple more. But one bag did cover my entire head.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the wand is so poorly made that it broke after 3 curlers were in. I taped the wand from a suggestion from another viewer of these curlers and that worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curl formers are amazing and easy to sleep in as well, I would say if you want to the style to last more than a day or so, you may need to use setting lotion or something with a firm hold. I use these on my natural African American hair while it was wet, put these in and went to bed. The next day you would have thought I want to a hair salon the way they turned out. They really work.</li>
    <li> They are just as large as the pink &amp; orange. I was hoping the colors &amp; sizes would be the same as curlformers but they&#x27;re not.</li>
    <li> Super fun and easy to use! I saw these curlers while in Manila, Philippines on TV...found these at a much better price! Work great! Get some and enjoy!</li>
    <li> I love it. It did do the work. The quality. Of the material  and the ease of use made. It a great. Productawesome</li>
    <li> Returned.  I assumed that since they were the same color as the narrow (corkscrew) Curlformers that I purchased at Sally&#x27;s that they would be the same diameter of curl.... They aren&#x27;t.  They are the medium spiral curl.  I read through all the descriptions on all the products offered before buying and there was just nothing to give me an indication as to the tightness of the curl.  Also, just as a warning to some... They arrived with no packaging, just in an everyday zip-lock bag with a barcode taped to it.  I am a freak about staying away from used products that will go in my hair so it just worried me a little bit.  I&#x27;ll stick to buying the real Curlformers, at least I know what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use, even on short hair.  Soft enough to sleep on and the curls are so bouncy and pretty the next day!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
    <li> They really do!!! But at half the price. I love these curlers. I and relaxed but I am justing to put has little to no heat in my hair. This has been AMAZING to use and create beautiful styles with. I would recommend to any one who wants the convenience of doing your own hair with the extra money or time of a beauty salon.</li>
    <li> I got these today in the mail (july 29th) and tried them out the same night. As far as curling it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found it kind of hard to pull my hair through the curlers though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I think my hair is too thick as I was trying to use all 24 pieces with a thick amount of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And the wand kept breaking in half to I had to reattach it over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Maybe because it was my first time using them...idk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to others. At least try it out and see how you like it.</li>
    <li> this was so easy to use and exceeded my expectations with the curl formation. i have natural kinky hair and this gave me a straightened look.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t sleep on these. I was surprised at how quick I caught on to how to use these! I dampen my hair (not soaked) and it slips right inside easily with the hook. I do wish they were a bit longer cause my hair is SUPER long (down to my butt) when I first used them. I sat under my dryer cap for awhile and BAM! Came out curly like the actresses wear! Plus it stayed in for days which is saying a lot for my thick hair that usually drops curl within an hour of doing it! I have had 5-6 inches cut off my hair (bad hair dresser) and haven&#x27;t tried them on the now shorter hair but I am sure it will be even easier. Side note, I hadn&#x27;t tried them yet because I was badly injured and unable to at the moment, not because of the rollers. I plan on buying more for smaller curls up front.</li>
    <li> great product, good curls, too bad they take forever to put in but i love the results.&lt;br /&gt;way better buy than 80$ at Salleys for the same exact thing</li>
    <li> These work just a well and the name brand version. Make sure to detangle your hair really well because you can get snags. and the wand if you pull to hard can snap apart in the middle of pulling one through so handle with care.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this product for a while. I&#x27;m so glad I finally got it. O course you have to use it on wet or damp hair, but I was totally impressed the hold of the curls without using any holding products. No straight; ends here every last hair got curled. I would say that for best results to do it in small sections (about 1 inch sections depending on how thick or thin you hair is.) this will most likely require that you buy two packs but who cares they are not only a great product they are also for sale at a great price!</li>
    <li> I always heard a lot about the curl formers and I just HAD to try them for myself. I have very course long thick hair that normally takes 3hrs to dry under the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and air dried my hair and blow dried on cool for a few minutes to get a poofy look. I then used leave in conditioner and oils to moisturize my hair before applying the curl formers. After sleeping in the them over night I LOVED my results!! I had a very clean soft silky spiral curl (pinterest bianca lascano for images).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to apply and to remove. I would suggest pin curling curls after you wear them the first day so they won&#x27;t get frizzy.</li>
    <li> This product works well. I am a hairdresser and would recommend using it. It works on all types of hair and it&#x27;s healthier than hot curling irons.</li>
    <li> I order these Curl Formers because of the great reviews on youtube about this product, they seem like a good quality product, they come in a very cute bag with a zipper, so that when you are not using them they can be stored safely.yes they are the same size as the orange and pink ones,but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the product description</li>
    <li> Seen it on youtube. I figure I try them</li>
    <li> These were chosen as an alternative to the other pricey name-brand item.  I have never used the other kind, so cannot make a comparison that way.  However, they worked well and we didn&#x27;t have any issues.  The only problem is that one of the plastic/rubber edges on the ends were ripped straight out of the package.  I didn&#x27;t understand what the different colors were for, but do now...it&#x27;s the direction of the curl.</li>
    <li> Very difficult to sleep on, but curls hair very well.</li>
    <li> Well, I had to try it. They&#x27;re interesting. I would suggest using them at night and trying to sleep in them and letting them air dry. Heating up plastic doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea to me. These aren&#x27;t really comfortable to use, at times it hurts getting your hair through, even well combed, conditioned, and misted. Not exactly easy to sleep in either, but you do get cute ringlets ... and a big ole flat spot you gotta work with. lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun beauty tool to have around.</li>
    <li> I totally love, love, love my hair after using these. I washed at night, applied after using jam custard and while my hair was damp (not wet), went to sleep and the next morning took then out and went to church. I had many compliments.</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I had to purchase more because my hair is so this and I love these. They are so simple to use and the curls last a while.</li>
    <li> The reason I give this product 5 stars is because when I can by 48 (2 packs) of these Vakind curlers for the same price of the Well known NAME brand which would buy me like 16 curlers AND the Vakind curlers actually performs just as well if not Better.  Yes, I said better. Why, because I have kinky coily hair (a genotype that is common among Black/african-americans) and these curlers produced smooth curls and stretched my hair without the application of heat.  This is hugh! As my hair type due to it being tightly curled is prone to breakage especially when heat is applied.  I bought three bags because my hair is also thick which makes a head full of curls look even more charming :-).  I will say the shipping was prompt and the product was in good shape.  I also own the name brand also and will say this is all around a better purchase.  Note these are not really narrow curlers but I am going to try to see if I can reshape them for a tighter curl. I will update my review and let you know if I am successful.</li>
    <li> The very first time I tried using these curl formers the woven pieces began to fray from the rubber ends. These definitely do not have the quality that real curl formers do, the plastic isn&#x27;t even as good (nor is the packaging it came in!). Don&#x27;t bother buying these, it&#x27;s probably better to go straight to the curl formers website, you&#x27;ll know you&#x27;re getting a quality product directly from the source.</li>
    <li> Extremely unfortunately, my package didn&#x27;t come with a hook. In addition, the instructions included were so poorly translated to English, none of the sentences made sense. Had to spend extra $ (going to sally to buy a hook) and loads of time (watching videos VS simply reading the instructions) before I could use this product.</li>
    <li> The curlers really do work. Didn&#x27;t have any problems with putting my hair through. Haven&#x27;t figured out how to make the curls last.</li>
    <li> This product is clearly an illegal and counterfeit product. The curlers are sub-standard, and are not the size advertised. They also give off a smell (like burned tyres) which could indicate the use of cheap (and probably illegal) plastics (that is also probably why they are so cheap in comparison with the original Curlformers). As well as this, the hook provided is very weak and breaks easily. However, the most urgent issue is that these products are being sold illegally. Next time, I won&#x27;t be duped by the positive reviews, I&#x27;ll buy the real thing and tell everyone else to do the same.</li>
    <li> Hard to do but it works.</li>
    <li> Love it came on time just like the pictures</li>
    <li> The way these were packaged it did not come out in ringlets. It came out the same as my orange and pink ones. They were packaged rolled into each other which made them stretch way wide. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> When I received these they were wrapped together in groups of four which is probably why they were stretched out and the same size as the pink and orange, so I wound up returning them.</li>
    <li> It worked. Came a little later than expected but i wont complain. Im fine with everything. Thanks guys for the business</li>
    <li> good quality, easy to use and hair doesn&#x27;t take long to dry. I would recommend this item for anyone that likes to wear their hair in spiral curls.</li>
    <li> These curl formers makes just perfect uniform curls each time u used them. very easy to put in hair to dry. and easy to store.</li>
    <li> I liked these. the package came within the specified time, and was in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;The curl formers did a good job on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;One criticism: they could have had some instructions included.</li>
    <li> I have really thick, long hair, so I bought to packages of these. I was surprised that I didn&#x27;t need too packs, I used about 32 rods. The product came with no instructions, so I had to watch a video on YouTube to see how to use it. The curls were very tight, but lasted several days. Sleeping was uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> They work good but sometimes it hurts and is hard to put them in. But if someone does it for you it would be easier.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any instructions on these I just kind of guessed, I have very thin hair and even curling iron curls just fall right out, I used some guess work, the first try I wad only able to get half my hair in the 25 curlers but it wad only a test rub my hair was dry and I blow dried for a few minutes and when I removed the curlers I for once in my life had beautiful curls , deciding my second attempt would be easier if unfilled my hair up into a ponytail , I was able to use less then half of the curlers this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the wand goes mine seems pretty sturdy and I so far have had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when they have had more use</li>
    <li> These are so easy to use. I have one minor issue. Sometimes the hook snags on my hair as I&#x27;m feeding it through the curler so I have to re comb and and restart that strand. It&#x27;s still easier than using regular hair curlers.</li>
    <li> Hey... These are 5 inches long... I believe 50cm is around 19 inches... What&#x27;s up with that?!! Can I get my money back or something?... Like really...</li>
    <li> Easy to use, great results, but hard to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I love these.  They are awesome.  These are the ones that do the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; curls.  Basically, I take a shower, let my hair air dry for a while, and then put them in and go to sleep.  I end up with big awesome curls.  It&#x27;s fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are way easier to put in when your hair is just damp instead of wet.  :)</li>
    <li> I have done a sample section just to see how form forming they were, and I love them! Each piece came out perfect. I can&#x27;t wait to due my whole head. My wond did arive with one side broken but once I snapped it together it worked good. I am hoping it don&#x27;t break on me. I didn&#x27;t want to hassle with sending it back. :(</li>
    <li> love these i bought a second set waiting for them to arrive. and you can even use them for perming hair and no need  fore  perming papers</li>
    <li> This product is just like the ones from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply but tons cheaper.  If only I knew about these then.  I spent $80 on the Sally&#x27;s ones and could have had these instead.  They are exactly the same as the curl formers.  I would definitely recommend them.  I got fast shipping too.  So this is an excellent purchase.  you have to look online to find instructions but that is ok.  If you know what to do, these are exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I watched a couple of you tube videos and thought that it looked easy to do. It&#x27;s easy if you are doing to someone else. Also was not very comfortable to sleep with them</li>
    <li> i have used this product now for about 4 weeks.  I love the curls and how they fall, perfect every time.  I took me at least 2 tries to learn how to put them in my hair.</li>
    <li> Gives me perfectly formed curls. Stay in my hair from the root without slipping. I recommend having a few hours while awake to use them, because they are annoying to sleep on.</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful curls! My hair has never been able to curl, but with this I&#x27;ve been able to have curls all day long. The only downside is that they are uncomfortable to sleep in. The bonus is that I am not using heat on my hair!</li>
    <li> These will probably work the same as the name brand BUT the diameter of the blue/green are the same as the pink/orange of the original. No need to order these if you want narrow curls because these are not narrow.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/loosely curled hair, I ordered these to help tame  the wildness into ringlets and they work great!</li>
    <li> We love this product. My daughter&#x27; hair looks wonderful.  She went to school as a lovely looking teen.  We love the product.</li>
    <li> These curlformers arrived timely and in perfect shape!  They are great, easy to use, easy to sleep on too if you use them at night.  I enjoyed the curls!  They do less damage to your hair then applying heat.  I also ordered the larger curl kit!</li>
    <li> the ringlets toke me for every to do , my hair didn&#x27;t come out right it look a mass but it was me not the curlformers it was something I  didn&#x27;t do rigth, just ole school ,I could not get it 6hr ,that how long i was up puting the curler former -N- and NO i do NOT have @ lot of hair Lol try ,try try , try again .......</li>
    <li> These do exactly what they say they do, I am very pleased with them!! I washed my hair, put in some good moroccan oil, then put in the curlers and left them overnight. in the morning they were perfectly dried and super super curly!! totally cute and shiny!! Was a little awkward sleeping but once I got used to them, it was pretty easy &amp; well worth it!!! My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a curl with heating instruments well so I was really excited that these actually works so nicely.. My hair stayed curled for 48 full hours and then I washed it so it may have even stayed longer than that. When I first pulled them out they were super super tight curls and then by the next day they were beautiful waves. I bet I could make it last a whole three days with some dry shampoo and it still be rockin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome stuff</li>
    <li> Bought the curl formers and paid $70 for a pack. These did the same job just as well for SOOO much less AND they were much better for longer hair.  I will definitely be getting another pack or maybe two.  Heck you can get 4 packs for the price of one set of curlformers -- do yourself a favor in these tight economic times and save the $$.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; for the curler is abit short. For the price I guess it&#x27;s ok . You just need to have patience to use it as it&#x27;s alittle short. A lot of pulling and tugging.</li>
    <li> I did not like the rods they pulled my hair.</li>
    <li> Very good especially for the price. Just what I expected. I will have to purschase more due to having very thick hair!</li>
    <li> The curl formers arrived even faster than expected.  My daughter loved the way her hair looks with this product.  I would  recommend this product to any person with long hair who does not want to use heat to style it.</li>
    <li> I have curly/kinky hair and I was almost positive that this would not work for me.  I was very, very wrong.  This device was very simple to use and the finished product was great.  All I put in my hair was water and a moisturizer and in the morning I had beautiful curls.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curlers are very uncomfortable making it difficult to sleep.  In addition I did snag my hair a few times as I was pulling it through the device.</li>
    <li> Did not have the wand included. Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> This item was a great buy and my kid loves having her hair done. So glad I ordered it and the price was very good. I would recommend it to anyone who likes spiral curls.</li>
    <li> love this it works awesome and i get plenty of compliments with my hair when I do use it , just don&#x27;t try to pull to much hair through or it will hurt. I have thick shoulder length hair and thought there wouldn&#x27;t be enough for all my hair but i was surprised that there actually was enough!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product that everyone should try. This works well on all hair types. I used this product on wet hair, and when I woke the next morning, I had beautiful dry curls.</li>
    <li> Love these, they do the job and not crazy expensive</li>
    <li> It takes practice putting them in ones hair but the device does what it said it can do.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that hair is very wet to help with the setting process of the curl. The curl will be tighter.</li>
    <li> I love the curlformers they are awesome,everyone need some .I did my daughters hair and she love it . 100%</li>
    <li> I love...love...LOVE these things! I went to Sally&#x27;s at first but once I saw the price, I has to search around. It works just like the real thing. No problems or issues! Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with one the price and two the product. I have recommended this product to others and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> My DD does competitive cheer and we could never get the perfect curl. This gave her that perfect curl, and being her father, I can even do it. Not hard at all. Sometimes the hair falls off the hook half way and I end up pulling her hair, but they work fine. A little uncomfortable to sleep in.</li>
    <li> I hate this product.  It is very difficult to use and there are no instructions with it.  the needle is not long enough to get all the way through the curler.  I tangled my hair badly trying to use this.</li>
    <li> I saw them on youtube and thought I&#x27;d try them.  They work perfectly everyting.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments and I find them very easy to use.  I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for an easy way to curl the hair effortlessly evertime with professional results.  Love them!!</li>
    <li> First DO your reasearch, its a knock off of Sally&#x27;s Curlformers so just google and youtube curlformers and they are a ton of video tutorial. Second Great for Natural Hair Folks and all hair types. I used them in my friends hair because my hair is like 4inches. She looked really cute and she loved her hair. The hook is cheap and their are a few tears in the curlers themselves but  if  you want high quality buy the $70 version, if you don&#x27;t want to do that buy these,other than a few tears in some curlers and a mediocre hook  it works and I can&#x27;t wait to use them in my hair when it grows longer. Great for natural hair especially when trying to avoid heat but still get great curls. They don&#x27;t come with instructions so look up how to use them and follow all the tips because if you don&#x27;t you may risk ripping your hair out with the hook or breaking the curlers.</li>
    <li> Just fell out of my hair.  I watched the videos, but apparently some details escaped me.  Return process we very easy. I&#x27;m thankful for that.</li>
    <li> The stick broke within first spiral set.  Glad I bought a second one or I would have been screwed!!  I have natural type 3C/4A hair and it sometimes snags within the spiral curler.  This is a very bulky and heavy set, but yields an elongated spiral curl.</li>
    <li> Just like the original brand but way cheaper.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I used these the first time make great curls! the curls were very tight.  It did not come with instructions but I was able to find a Utube for help, was not very hard</li>
    <li> The material for these is a little different from the Curl formers, but they work all the same.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because the hook is sooo CHEAP.  It did not snap together tightly and wobbled and it broke halfway through the process.  If you order these order one of the Curl Formers hooks.</li>
    <li> These are just like the curlformers I ordered from sally&#x27;s. They are like the wide long so I will return the curlformers.</li>
</ol>
