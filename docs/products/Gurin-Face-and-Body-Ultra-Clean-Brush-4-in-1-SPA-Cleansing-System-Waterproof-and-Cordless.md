<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item is a must have, I love the way it makes my skin feel and for the price......it&#x27;s a deal, two thumbs up for me!!!!</li>
    <li> ...for the first night.  Made my face real soft before bed.  But next morning...nothing.  Wouldn&#x27;t rotate or nothing.   I&#x27;m going to return it...I might order it again since I need a brush.  Maybe I got a defected one or something.   **original review**  The face brush is soft. I read a review about how the face brush was too hard on their sensitive skin. However my 7 year old niece played with it right out of the box (before soap and water soften the brush) and said it was soft and didn&#x27;t hurt her face, and she skin is sensitive...reddens real easily. My 1 year old wanted to try it too and I tried it on the back of his hand and he giggled. So unless your skin is SUPER sensitive, you scrub REAL hard, or just leave it sitting there in one spot forever...it should be fine.  I used the body brush with my coffee scrub. It works good but since the handle is short, I&#x27;m not throwing out my back brush.  I&#x27;m very confuse on the sponge...it just seems like it&#x27;ll get dirty real fast. Instructions say to use it with a face cream and the rotation/vibration it suppose to help your skin absorb said cream easier... But sponges absorbs everything and hold on to it...so how clean is it really for you to keep using on your face? Seems illogical...and since I have acne prone skin, I&#x27;m not risking it. :/  The stone does its job. :)  Other reviews talked about how they can&#x27;t open the battery compartment. Since its suppose to be waterproof (it is, just use it in the shower) it&#x27;s pretty airtight. It is really similar to my battery powered toothbrush. (that I can never get open) Instead of yanking on it; I find jiggling it side to side while pulling it works best. But if it&#x27;s on real tight it might take a few tries. I got it open pretty easy. (easier then my toothbrush...)  Overall I love it. Hope this helps.  **will update if something happens**</li>
    <li> I have Roscea and my dermatologist recommended I get a cleaning system.  My husband purchased the Gurin Face and Body Cleansing System in August 2013 due to it&#x27;s small size and the ability to work in the shower.  I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the small brush first on my face along with my medicated wash. My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference. Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa. I tried the pumice stone on my hubby&#x27;s feet, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease. I love this cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.  Not only is my face relatively free from breakouts, but my skin is now ready for the coming summer months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly Potts&lt;br /&gt;Raleigh NC</li>
    <li> Havent used it yet, but looks good.</li>
    <li> I got this face and body cleanser system a couple weeks ago and I love it! My skin looks fresh and clean.  The pumise stone is great for feet, leaves heels soft better than a pedicure!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on groupon but I wanted to leave a review. I absolutely loved this cleaning brush. It took off the dead skin, leaving it brighter and more even. However, it&#x27;s not waterproof. The water seeps into the battery cover and the batteries began rusting. I cleaned it out daily with Q-tips but now it just quit working. It got ruined. If it was waterproof or rechargeable instead it would get 5 stars. It was great while it lasted. Now I&#x27;m searching for a new one.</li>
    <li> ok, well i used to have this product by another brand and liked it better. this one is good, the only trouble is its not powerful enough to use the large brush on the body or the pumice stone. just not enough power. the small brush and sponge heads for the face are excellent tho.</li>
    <li> I indulged in buying this and because of it, I feel my face is being pampered after years of neglect. It&#x27;s a very nice product that  can be used on feet as well.</li>
    <li> I loved this scrubber until it broke after three uses. I left a two star review here and was contacted immediately. I didn&#x27;t have time to respond, however, the company sent me a replacement free of charge just based on my review here. I have changed the star rating to 5, just based on how awesome the customer service was! I&#x27;m excited to be able to use this again, it really does leave your pores feeling clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. Cheap product cheaply made doesn&#x27;t do the job it&#x27;s supposed to. The brush doesn&#x27;t have a strong enough motor to rotate and do its job. DO NOT BUY unless you like throwing your money away or like to return things.</li>
    <li> connector inside the handle broke free after a few weeks of use..... motor spins... but no longer spins the brush....</li>
    <li> i bought this to my sister for her birthday present, and she likes it, when she used this she can feel the dirt on her face was perfectly remove and the hopefully this product will last.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a friend suggested using a scrub on my face to have fresher look. I light the Gurin Face Brush as it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use. The face brush is good for the face- non-abrasive.  I also use the small pumice brush for my feet as well..</li>
    <li> I have bought three. 3. of them. And each one has had its own problem. 1-the seal that waterproofs it malfunctioned and broke and the engine died from water damage. Assuming I must have gotten a defective one I bought a second. 2-the on/off switch must have broken or become un attached to the wires that connect it to the batteries and to the motor. The motor worked fine, there was no water damage only I had no access to the button itself so I could not attempt to fix it. So assuming since this was a completely un related defect. I bought a third. 3-I don&#x27;t know what happened here but one of the connections must have been loose and it was for some reason only sometimes getting power. Until the connection was completely lost. I&#x27;m assuming it was a similar issue as the second one I bought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these but all three have in total lasted me 6 months. Total. Unless the company agrees to send me another. For free. I&#x27;m going to move on to the next product. Hopefully others won&#x27;t have as many defects and won&#x27;t break as easily. I hope yours work better.</li>
    <li> I love this Face and Body brush set! It works so well!.My skin looks feels clean after every use. I do not see those dry spots anymore. Most pleased with the price compared to other products in beauty supply stores</li>
    <li> I use this product about once a week for a deep clean. It came with extra brushes and has two settings for high or low spin. It is rechargeable with its own stand. NO BATTERIES NEEDED! It is also made in America so getting replacement brushes is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter to help her with breakouts. Over the years I have invested in many other acne products which did little to clear up her skin. The facial brush left her skin better than it has ever been. She loves the way her skin feels and does not miss a day without using it! She raved about it so much that I just purchased one for myself.</li>
    <li> Love this it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> Just brought it, works great, I hope it will last. I wish it had two speed though and you could order more brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought this same set somewhere else and they added a scrub and cost twice as much!!  I found this for my daughter&#x27;s wedding shower and was thrilled to see the price!  It&#x27;s a nice little machine that cleans and exfolliates.  My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I was a bit unsure about my purchase when I decided to finally treat myself to a brush meant specifically to clean only my face.&lt;br /&gt;After searching on amazon for 20min or so, i find this jewel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only expecting to see and feel minimal change after one use. After cleaning my face with the small brush for about 3-4 min, during the wash period I could feel my skin, like actually feel how soft and smooth it was! AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after drying off my face I could see the my face looked brighter and slightly more youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely something I would recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. it cleans good but i wish the power button would stay on. I have to hold it to keep it on while im cleaning my face soooo annoying! And it is hard to open the battery part but like everyones saying its probably cuz its waterproof.</li>
    <li> So far, so good, Ive had it for maybe 3 weeks now and its running fine. If anything else happens ill update my review. But its inexpensive, it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Wonderful, my skin is glowing!!!</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Excellent value. Excellent service in regards to shipping, packing, quality. Skin is much improved, would assume that this is playing a role in the fact...Will get another one when this one wears out.</li>
    <li> Excellent works great! It was just what I expected and it is well made. I use it almost every day and love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to better exfoliate/reduce acne and it has definitely helped with both! My only complaint is that after using the pumice stone on my foot, it seemed as though the attachments didn&#x27;t secure as tightly as before.  With a little finagling I was able to get it to fit securely, but it&#x27;s for this reason I can&#x27;t justify giving it 5 stars.  Definitely worth buying though, the price is great for the value you get.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Arrived as expected, no damages to box and all parts included.  However, when I put in the batteries, nothing happened.  Doesn&#x27;t turn on.  I thought maybe I had grabbed some old batteries, so got another 4 AAs out of a new package.  Still didn&#x27;t work.  And I made sure several times that I was putting them in the correct way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed because this had good reviews and the attachments were exactly what I was looking for.  I&#x27;m going to contact the company and see if they can send a replacement.  Had high hopes, but can&#x27;t say how it works if I can&#x27;t get it to work.  Diaappointing</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to purchase a Clarisonic but I do not want to pay the high price associated with it so I purchased this cleaning brush system.  I like that it comes with various attachments especially the large body brush.  I think I like it for the body better than the face.  The face brush is somewhat small and the bristles are soft but I do not feel like they are flexible enough.  The pumice stone did not do anything for my feet so I went back to my old one.  Overall, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This little machine does really well with my skin. I had some discoloration that I was hoping this would reduce and it did after a short amount of time. For what you pay this is fantastic product just for the facial brush alone but you get three more that are just a bonus in my opinion. I would suggest this product because it has done exactly what I purchased it for. It is a really sturdy brush but very gentle at the same time. Great for making sure ALL of your makeup is removed at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Sometimes pressing the on button keeps the brush rotating, other times I have to hold the on button down while I use it to wash my face.</li>
    <li> The product is pretty mediocre for several reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Face brush is gentle and pretty good for the face, but the body brush is made of the same material and is too gentle for body skin. In  other words, it doesn&#x27;t do anything to your body. It needs to be more harsh to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. There is only one single speed, so its the same gentle speed for the face and body. You need higher speed to exfoliate your body and to use the pumice stone. So the body brush and the pumice stone are useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There is a problem with the \\&quot;on\\&quot; switch. It doesn&#x27;t stay on, you need to press it all the time while you are using it. Maybe, I received a defective unit. Few times it stayed on without holding it, but it looked like it happened by mistake, since it turned off by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will return this product.</li>
    <li> I would probably love this brush if i could use it more than one time without having to change their batteries. Not worth it!</li>
    <li> Installed new batteries. It worked well for about a week. I tried to use it this morning and I could tell the brush wasn&#x27;t rotating at top speed then it just stopped completely. Not sure if I just got a defective unit, but it is junk.</li>
    <li> This broke within 2 weeks. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;water proof&amp;#34; yet water seeped inside the brush. Into the battery. Not worth it. I did get my refund.</li>
    <li> i only got 3 uses out of it before it wouldn&#x27;t come on. I have fresh batteries in it and it still doesn&#x27;t come on. I was better off buying the $40 one</li>
    <li> Recently, I purchase the cleansing system, It really works for me . I used to have some breakout on my face, and since I started using it I think that my face looks better. I love it.</li>
    <li> The brush was awesome but the face head seems to have been used, the bristles looked dull after using it besides the old looking heads I would give this 4 stars</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Gurin Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System. It was fantastic for about a week (it really was perfection when working properly). I did no drop it or damage it in any way and it no longer has the power it originally had. It stops spinning as soon as I touch my face with it/ which is kinda point. The little pressure I can put on it for it to spin would not be effective. So, I thought it was maybe the batteries (which if it burned through 4AA batteries weekly, it would also not be satisfactory). I just replaced them with expensive lithium batteries and it still has the same issues. I would very much like a replacement. As I said, it was outstanding for a week but this is obviously not right. Please do the right thing, Gurin. It&#x27;s a little expensive for it not to be working for more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----&lt;br /&gt;Update, Gurin came through and replaced the unit. Once again it&#x27;s amazing, we&#x27;ll see if it lasts more than a week. If so, it gets 6 stars!</li>
    <li> Living in a rural area, it’s difficult to find an affordable beauty salon offering facial exfoliating and cleansing catering services; however with the Gurin Face and Body ultra clean brush, I can treat myself to facials in the comfort of my own home.  The cons such as being cordless, waterproof, and easy to pack make it a great item to take along on overnight trips as well. The additional attachments are an added bonus for more specific body cleansing. The only thing to improve this product would be providing an alternative power source to use in combination to increase battery life.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Well it works from time to time... the on button is getting stuck ans sometimes works, sometimes not! I would not recommend it</li>
    <li> Never had the Clarisonic but have had others and this is by far the best.  Great brushes  and love the large body size brush that I never had before.  Sturdy, battery operated.  Very satisfied with my purchase</li>
    <li> Seems to be working great for my daughter.She liked it, but felt it was a little rough on her face at first.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I only use my olay one for travel now</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;battery operated&lt;br /&gt;I do feel like it cleans/exfoliates my face well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;The machine doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough for the pumice stone and larger brush to work.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product for 8 months and it&#x27;s starting to fall apart.  The seal that keep the batteries from getting wet is coming loose.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know a motor could actually work this poorly.  If you want to dust your face, than this will work, anything beyond that, this tool is not up to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week on my face, and I noticed my skin looks cleaner, and feels softer. It does a good job for the price you pay, but there were a few downsides that I experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The battery compartment was very hard to open.&lt;br /&gt;-There is no timer, so you have to just get an idea of how long you need to use it on your face for.&lt;br /&gt;-If you ever overuse the brush on your face it quickly starts getting twisted bristles which can irritate your face, but this can be avoided if you just gently use it over your face without pushing too hard, and not use it for too long in one spot.&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s tough to clean the brushes without pushing them inward, and if you push inward on the brush head to clean it the bristles change direction and that irritates your face too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the best way to use it is to be very gentle on the facial brush when using it and cleaning it, otherwise it will start feeling rough on your skin. And there are replacement brushes that you can buy if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a very good product for the price. It does what is stated in the description.</li>
    <li> Amazing product and a great price. The package comes with 4 brushes that I use daily(face, body, feet,and face sponge)&lt;br /&gt;My order also arrived on time, actually before time, and carefully wrapped in the package. I plan to order more as gifts.</li>
    <li> I have brought this product recently where they have involved in providing accurate output. They are easier for using where this device also consist of one click operation as well as they are in comfortable size. Overall it is considered as one of the best product for using.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a facial brush for a long time and was planning on getting a more expensive model from Macy&#x27;s.  Someone recommend this and so far so good.  I have nothing to compare it to but it cleans my face really well,</li>
    <li> I always wanted more than just a washcloth for my face and when I saw this product I had to have it. It worked very well and I can see a smoother difference right away. I was hoping the spinner would be faster but it&#x27;s a good thing its not as I would spin my face off. This is a must have product and the price is right! (This is the wife talking)</li>
    <li> Ok, but it eats batteries.  One of the few that can be used in the bathtub. Needs the existing speed plus a faster speed.  The existing speed is OK for the face, but too slow for back or feet.</li>
    <li> I just received this item in the mail, and I&#x27;m returning it back ASAP. It&#x27;s cheap feeling, and cheap looking.! Thank God I had a whole pack of Double &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; batteries in my kitchen draw, because this little bad boy needs &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; Double &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; batteries, which is &amp;#34;NOT&amp;#34; included. &amp;#34;I mean the speed is SOOOO slow.&amp;#34;  And there&#x27;s only (1 speed) to this cheap thing! The bristles to the brush head for your face is waaaay too soft for the little amount of speed it gives off. Glad I can return this thing, and search for a different brand online.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this item. I was not sure about getting it at first but the fact that you can not only use it for your face, but your body and your feet is awesome! It did make giving myself a pedi much less wearing.</li>
    <li> Looked like EXACTLY what I wanted...but second time I used it, the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button no longer worked. I have to hold the button in, before I could just push it for constant use. I worry about the connection for the attachment connections. They are flimsy and do not look like they will hold up. Must say that other than the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, the machine has performed as advertised.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a great exfoliater but I was very wrong! Not sure if I got a damaged one or if they are really this powerless.  When I used this Cleaning brush and placed it on my skin the head stopped rotating.  It seems to not have enough power to rotate the head even with the slighted of pressure. I tried 2 different sets of batteries but no change.  Bummer of a product.  There is no way that this will clean a thing yet exfoliate!  I took to long fiddling with it trying to get it too work, now I can&#x27;t get a refund or exchange :(  Boo!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve already searched for an inexpensive facial brush on Amazon, you&#x27;ve probably noticed that a lot of them physically look like this one but are all priced differently.  I bought the Vitagoods brand brush on Amazon for about $10 more than this one.  After about 1 year, that brush stopped working and I wanted a replacement.  This one looked exactly the same and was cheaper so I thought I would give it a try.  It&#x27;s not the same at all.  The on/off button is very difficult to press (it&#x27;s a concealed button covered by the rubber grip) and the overall quality is lacking. You definitely get what you pay for when it comes to these brushes.  I&#x27;d recommend the Vitagoods brand as they are still less expensive than leading brands and work much better than this one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it!  Great price, I&#x27;m planning to buy one for myself as well!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t rotate as fast as I&#x27;d like.  I wish it came with some sort of bag that you could hang in the tub to store it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim, glad I did. The product is easy to assemble, and works like a charm. After 3 days I could see a difference in my complexion. I am glad I purchased this. I often have some break outs and it has definitely help with that. My skin feels alot cleaner and smoother. I do not use it every day but a few times a week. I am really impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I love this little brush, it is like a magic wand! I use twice daily with Derma E Very Clear face wash...love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am ordering one for my sister for Christmas!</li>
    <li> My skin isn&#x27;t sensitive at all, in fact, I tend to get skin cell build up so exfoliating is essential for my skin, usually daily. Exfoliating by hand and massaging in body oil can be time consuming so when I stumbled upon electric facial and body brushes I was intrigued. This one had the best reviews of having a powerful motor and being waterproof and sturdy so I decided to try this one. I attend college and Oklahoma and right now it&#x27;s hot and somewhat humid and I have oily skin so I find myself constantly feeling greasy and my skin feeling weighed down. I received my product today and went back to my dorm between classes to try it out on my face and I am very impressed so fair. My skin feels like it&#x27;s breathing and is very soft after using the brush and sponge to cleanse and apply moisturizer.</li>
    <li> this product is great i like the way it make my face and skin feel i use it as often as i can remember mostly 3-4 times a week i would get this for a gift for a friend the price is amazing</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning on my face and am very happy with the results. I have not used the other brushes as often, but think they are effective as well. I would recommend this product to anyone considering purchasing a face cleansing system.</li>
    <li> I got this while it was on sale to finally replace the exfoliating manual brush I had been using on my face in combination with a facial scrub. This is a nifty little thing. I love that it is waterproof and you can pretty much get all your exfoliating done in the shower. The brushes feel nice against the skin, not too rough at all, and the padded applicator is awesome to really work in your facial cream afterwards. I have even used the big brush to apply lotion after showering and it really works it in your skin with the rotating bristle action. Only downer-it&#x27;s over pressure sensitive and will stop spinning when you push a little harder.</li>
    <li> Bought this product and have been using it for about 8 months or so. I didn&#x27;t ever use one previously, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to per se. However, I am am fairly pleased with the product. I use it when performing my facial cleansing routine post-makeup. The bristles are about a medium strength, which is not harsh. However, I do wish the system was a little &#x27;stronger&#x27;...I also exfoliate my skin with a manual scrub, so I am used to &#x27;feeling&#x27; it a little more...lol. I have also used the pumice stone for my feet. It&#x27;s &#x27;ok.&#x27; Other than that, I think it&#x27;s great for a starter system and you don&#x27;t necessarily want to spend a huge amount of money.</li>
    <li> returned because I ordered 2 of the same thing just different brands.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t open the box for quit some time because I had purchased this item before but this time right out of the box the motor would hardly turn the big brush whish is the one that I use the most ... so just be aware that you should check it early.</li>
    <li> My skin looks younger, and fresher due to daily use of the brush. I mostly use the face brush, and not the body brush. I occasionally use the sponge for deep penetration of my moisturizer, and also use the pumice stone on occasion. It&#x27;s the face brush that prompted me to buy the 4-in-1 SPA cleansing system, and I&#x27;m very glad I did!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product, however, when it arrived and I tried to turn it on...the &#x27;On&#x27; switch is defective. You have to hold it down the entire time you are using it and or it shuts off.  You can hear the &#x27;Off&#x27; button click Off but the On button is broken. Very disappointed....guess I should have purchased the other product I was looking at.  :(</li>
    <li> Very good product. I use it twice a week on my&lt;br /&gt;face with the small brush and the pumus on&lt;br /&gt;my caluses,knees and elbo&#x27;s. Does a great&lt;br /&gt;job at smoothing the skin.</li>
    <li> ....IF ONLY..... I WISH I HAD THIS SINCE THE 70&#x27;s. This is my skin dream come true.  ...and talk about Soothing and Relaxing, this little jewel is all around transforming!! My battery case doesn&#x27;t seem to snap tightly closed so I sealed it with clear tape to be certain moisture didn&#x27;t penetrate the inside compartment. BTW, the power consumption is not chewing through batteries like I anticipated. I have not even had to replace batteries one time yet!</li>
    <li> I just receive my package with of this unit pop in brand new batteries and the unit does not work. this is crap. it is going to cost me more to ship this item back to the US than how much I&#x27;ve paid for it.</li>
    <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited as long as I had this works great on my skin very noticable changes in its apperance.</li>
    <li> nice overall machine works well has a lot of attachments and does a great job overall would get another one</li>
    <li> This scrubber doesn&#x27;t even have the power to rotate when applied to the skin surface. Useless in my opinion..should return it</li>
    <li> I love this - and I believe it cleans my face much better than simply a cloth and water.  I saw a difference in my skin in a week!</li>
    <li> We purchased this at the very end of May/beginning of June.  My husband and I both use it once a day and have had to change the batteries twice already.  This morning, it suddenly stopped working.  It wasn&#x27;t dropped, dunked in water, mishandled or misused in anyway. It just quit. We got three months of use out of it, and that just doesn&#x27;t seem to be worth the money.  While it WAS working, however, it was fantastic! It cleared our skin well and was a great scrub brush. I wish it would have kept up because it was a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  I love it!  It is the perfect item to clean and care for my skin.  The price is competitive and I received all 4 attachments for $19.99.  In addition, I can see and feel a definite improvement in my skin.  I fully endorse this product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> I bought this item consecutively, [2 times in a row]. I had hoped that it would be perfect to assist myself in the cleaning process[in the bathtub], as I am disabled, at all times suffering from no energy[HASHIMODO DISEASE]. on the first one, the brush stopped spinning.... on the second use. the second one got watered logged and ruined the batteries. It &amp;#34;may be&amp;#34; water resistant, but it is definitely &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;....I will not be purchasing this product for a 3rd time. i</li>
    <li> I purchased the Gurin Ultra Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System about 6 months ago from an online \\&quot;Daily Deal Site\\&quot; for a great price.  I didn&#x27;t use the product at first, but then slowly started working it into my routine.&lt;br /&gt;I have only used the Small Facial Brush (deep cleaning) and am working my way towards the Big Body Brush (exfoliate and preps the body for lotion).&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the Facial Sponge (Perfect for Sensitive Skin and can also be used to apply foundation/lotion/serum evenly) or the Pumice Stone (gently remove calluses and dead skin).  I don&#x27;t have that much time in my daily routine to fit those items in.  Maybe sometime in the future, but not now!&lt;br /&gt;I really like the product. Listed below are my comments:&lt;br /&gt;* It operates exactly as advertised&lt;br /&gt;* It is waterproof and can be used in the shower&lt;br /&gt;* It is easy to operate and I have only had to change the battery once&lt;br /&gt;* It has helped to clear up some of my acne&lt;br /&gt;* It exfoliates pretty good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy the product again. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love how this comes with 4 brushes. I dont have the time to go and get pedicures and the pumice stone head works amazing. The facial head is not to hard and not to soft and when it starts to spin it really takes care of business. The body brush is great but sometimes I&#x27;m in a rush and just dint have the time to use it.I would definitely recommend this to anyone. You cant beat the price</li>
    <li> Junk. Power button sometimes won&#x27;t turn off.</li>
    <li> I love the way my face and body feels after I use this brush in the shower. Also if you use it with your favorite soap or buy a special soap ( natural, skin clearing etc) you will see the effects of that soap very well! I used this brush with a skin clearing soap and 1.5 weeks later the compliments started rolling in. I thought it was just in my head but others were noticing my glowing skin.</li>
    <li> It stopped working in a little over a week!!</li>
    <li> On my second brush. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is cheaply made and the head came cracked.  It does nothing to clean your foot or face or anything.  Waste of money.  Ones own hand or the hand of your spouse has more scrub power than this plastic junk!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this cleaner much, but I&#x27;ve had a pretty good experience so far. It is in fact waterproof, and helps to cleanse the face and body. At least, it&#x27;s more fun to use than a towel. The rotation is very mild, perhaps even weak, but that is perhaps for the best. It is a good speed for light washing. I deduct one star because the button to activate it sometimes becomes stuck and so the machine does not always respond. Holding the button is a sure way to activate it, but is tedious. Besides that, it is just fine.</li>
    <li> small face brush starts wearing down after couple uses....not strong bristles.  i will use this set for pedicures and spluge on a clarisonic or some other good brand for facials.</li>
    <li> I am SO sorry I bought this, AND that I neglected to return it before the return date. My disappointments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The head wobbles when washing the face. I attached and re-attached the head, but it still wobbles&lt;br /&gt;2) I can&#x27; buy individual brushes as I need them, the only replacements are full sets of brushes. no other manufacturer does this, seems like a racket to make one buy more than is needed&lt;br /&gt;3) There seems to be little power running the machine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have waited and bought a Clarisonic. You get what you pay for...</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing brush. I went with a different brand that was more expensive and it broke after a week, did not have as much power and the company ignored my request to get a new one. That was one BriteLeafs. When i got this the on button was not sticking on , so i had to hold the button down to keep it on. It was so easy to contact the company and within 15 minutes of emailing them they had already told me they would be sending a new one for me. I love this brush, and great customer service!</li>
    <li> its okay&lt;br /&gt;the only I dont like to change batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like cHARGER better&lt;br /&gt;battaies is a problem ok</li>
    <li> I purchased this product a couple of weeks ago and my feet have not been the same, I love to use the foot scrubber after the shower and a homemade facial using my onwer face ultra brush , I love this produce I should have purchase one for my  friends for christmas presents, excellent product</li>
    <li> It works pretty good, but it&#x27;s one of those unnecessary beauty items women tell themselves they need to buy. Use a wash cloth instead. It&#x27;s cheaper and does the same thing.</li>
    <li> I purchased this a while back to help with my sensitive acne prone skin and my face was too sensitive for the brush. My skin would get really red , maybe if the brush was softer it could of benefitted me but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> OMG... this is so great.  So much better than the clarsonic.  Really gets your body clean.  Runs a long time on 4 batteries.</li>
    <li> use it all the time. low battery consumption</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  I have been using it twice daily and my face is improving!  It has lots of power and feels amazing.  I highly recommend this face massager. (And the other attachments are great, also.)</li>
    <li> I got this a couple of months ago, and I love it...it does exactly what is promised. The brushes/heads are great and the batteries last quite long...no problems whatsover!</li>
    <li> Its not as big as it looks but it works so I&#x27;ts fine for now. I would get it as a first one just for your face</li>
    <li> I purchased 1 for myself  about this time last year then purchased another one as a gift for my daughter.  About 3 months ago both of our brushes stopped working within 2 weeks of each other.  We both loved the facial brush but we&#x27;re disappointed that they didn&#x27;t last for at least a year. I think I paid about $29.00 each.  I ordered 2 Brite leaf smaller &amp; different version for $19.99 each.  The Brite Leaf products I bought about 2 months ago don&#x27;t work well at all.  The units barely spin when held against your skin (even lightly!). I would recommend the Gurin Face &amp; Body Brush - except, they apparently may quit in 9-10 months, so keep that in consideration!</li>
    <li> Love it. The battery cover is hard to remove but worth the effort. My skin looks and feels healthy, smooth and fresh. At 62, that&#x27;s better than great, it&#x27;s fabulous.</li>
    <li> This Cleansing System works very well. If used on a consistent basis, your skin will look amazing! My face was sun freckled and now it has a much better look after using the face brush for a couple of months. Using the bath brush is like going to a spa. The sponge is great for applying product to my face and the pumice takes away those callouses which we get on our feet, especially in the summer months. I would highly recommend this Cleansing System.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Worked great for 1.5 months. The mount for the attachments broke and just spins on the shaft now.</li>
    <li> I like the actually job it does, when it works!  The power button sucks though and you have to fight to turn it off!  Actually think it might be possessed as it has turned on by itself in the box before!  I now have to take the batteries out of it when I am not using it. And I have only had it for about 1 month.</li>
    <li> I have had my system for several months now and use it every morning.  It&#x27;s easy to use, I keep it in the shower and it does a very good job.</li>
    <li> I was originally looking at the very expensive systems prior to finding this steal. I was slightly skeptical considering how inexpensive the product was but thought of give it a shot anyhow. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. This waterproof system is handy, versatile and very effective. Leaves your face feeling very clean and smooth. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone interested.</li>
    <li> Good product. Good price!</li>
    <li> Bought this product because I have eczema and get a lot of dry skin on my face and body which is very hard to remove without harming the skin underneath (my skin is very sensitive, and any exfoliating wash can irritate/damage it). Some of the other brushes seemed more popular but I wanted to try one that was less expensive to see whether it was a good idea at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I was very pleased with the results- the brush is powerful but not too powerful, and in one use it helped me successfully remove SO much of the dead skin on my face without irritation or problems. It was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only granted it four stars because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) I find that it loosens, but doesn&#x27;t actually Remove the dry skin on my face and body- I think it might be because the brush bristles are too long, so I have to still wipe the dry skin off once it&#x27;s loosened, which is time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;2.) It can be hard to get it where you want it as it has a tendency to jerk in the direction that the brush rotates.&lt;br /&gt;3.) It tends to stall if you &#x27;push too hard&#x27; (i.e. anything more than letting it &#x27;glide&#x27; over skin [which is often not enough to make a difference for me]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good brush for those who&#x27;ve never tried one before and want to know if a brush is &#x27;right&#x27; for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to assemble and easy to switch brush heads&lt;br /&gt;-Reasonably waterproof&lt;br /&gt;-Aids the removal of dry skin&lt;br /&gt;-Fits well in your hand&lt;br /&gt;-Runs on batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t so much &#x27;remove&#x27; as &#x27;loosen&#x27; dry skin (I think it&#x27;s a tad too soft).&lt;br /&gt;-A bit hard to control, especially on the face.&lt;br /&gt;-Can stall if you apply &#x27;too much&#x27; pressure.</li>
    <li> Stopped working.. I&#x27;m trying to contact the seller.. It&#x27;s supposed to be waterproof.. ??? Not working for me.. Changed out batteries 2 x already in such a short time of owning it.. Think it should be replaced or get a refund!</li>
    <li> I am a 32 y/o female.  I am probably easiest described as a tomboy/minimalist when it comes to skin care.  I rarely wear makeup and I doubt I would ever be able to keep up with a disciplined skin care regimen.  However, I have started to show my age some, which isn&#x27;t very much fun.  I also have bouts with cystic acne.  I have whiteheads and blackheads which generally don&#x27;t bother me all that much but the cystic is awful because they take so long to heal and being under the skin makes them super annoying.  I have used a variety of face washes, never really settling on one wash for very long and I have never used a skin brush until now.  Finally, a little while ago, I got frustrated with my appearance.  So I have started looking into face washes and I decided to buy this brush set.  I am really glad I did.  It came fast, was easy to assemble (literally I put the batteries in and put one of the 4 heads on) and off I went.  I used it the first night with just the Aveeno Clear Complexion stuff I already had.  I did my whole face, lingering in each section for a few seconds and when I went to rinse my face...I WAS IMPRESSED.  My face felt so much softer, smoother and cleaner.  I have used it nightly since then!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy, mines broke in two uses. Can&#x27;t return it because, return window gone. It&#x27;s a waste. Find something better.</li>
    <li> The sponge extention is useless to me. It doesn&#x27;t do anything I can see. Sometimes I want a soft bristle but the sponge is not a good replacement for that.</li>
    <li> This is crap for a device. The connector for the attachments is flimsy and will break and the motor is the poorest quality ever. It stops once put against your skin.</li>
    <li> I sent this product back because it was not rechargeable, it was my fault I missakenly ordered the wrong one. there was nothing wrong with it, and im sure it worked great !</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She really likes it.  The fact that it is waterproof is very nice.  Better quality than many of the similarly priced models.</li>
    <li> This brush system looks great but I wasn&#x27;t able to use it...came to me broken. I will be buying a Vitagoods one instead to avoid this same problem.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift, and didn&#x27;t use it right away. It was packaged well, and in good shape. Put in the batteries, and tried it on my face. I liked that it seemed to not only clean my face, but also got rid of a bit of flaking I had. I have extremely sensitive skin, but had no irritation or excessive redness. I did try the sponge head briefly, but don&#x27;t usually use moisturizers or serum type products. I did have a problem with the switch not always staying &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; without holding it down. I emailed the manufacturer and they very quickly have a replacement on the way! Great service. This is a very reasonably priced product, and so far it&#x27;s definitely worth it. The replacement unit works great - for about a year now. I would like to be able to find just the face brush sold as replacement, but the set of 4 is pretty inexpensive through Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> Love! Very durable &amp; I love the different head attachments. Very gentle and worth the buck. I love it lots!</li>
    <li> Oh, you will love, love this.  I do.</li>
    <li> I have the Clariosonic Mia and I love this 100xs more. It does so much more for a fraction of the cost. After using it for a week I got many compliments on the rosy glow of my skin. It is vigorous and does the job. Also, I put the batteries in it over 4 months ago and it is still going strong. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> Was great for the first few weeks. After we replaced the batteries for the first time the cover refused to stay put and the unit comes apart in use. The cover latch is not very robust.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t  open the battery compartment. My husband &amp; I tried with all our strength to open battery compartment. Still not able. When my yard man comes I will ask him. Ridiculous!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday since I received it.  All attachments work well.  Gurin Customer Service is also very helpful and unbelievably fast!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product almost every day for the last 4 weeks and think that my skin looks better. I pretty much love it and use it every morning. If felt like, It took about 7 years off from my skin.  I recommend this product&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof&lt;br /&gt;Big Brush&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;Battery compartment was little hard to open</li>
    <li> An awesome product! don&#x27;t go and spend and over $100 when you can get the same brush that is just as good. even comes with attachments that other brushes don&#x27;t have. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have only had this for one week, but I see and feel a considerable difference in my skin.  It is easy to use, and easy to clean up.  My skin in smoother and putting on my moisturizer with the sponge is great.  I highly recommend this product.[[ASIN:B00CKDEIVC Gurin Face and Body Ultra Clean Brush 4-in-1 SPA Cleansing System, Waterproof and Cordless ]]</li>
    <li> I recently purchased the Gurin Face and Body Cleansing System and thought how good can it be for such a small device that works with batteries. This was an understatement, I could not believe how much power was packed in this handy little device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been suffering from a lot of breakouts I tried the small bush first on my face. My face felt clean and oil free after the first wash, I immediately felt the difference.  Next I tried the big body brush in the shower with one of my favorite scrubs, I felt like I just came from the spa. Last but not least was the pumice stone, which removed the dead skin and callouses with ease. This is a remarkable cleansing system and I highly recommend it for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one small issue I have with the product is the battery cover is too hard to remove however I assume this is part of the waterproofing.</li>
    <li> I like it. Works great. Let&#x27;s see if it continues.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t even open it to put batteries in. Don&#x27;t waste your money or energy. Extremely difficult to open!! Couldn&#x27;t do it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this order.</li>
    <li> After reading Oz-approved secrets to take ten years off your face, I purchased the Gurin exfoliator on 8/18/14 and my partner and I are using it three times a week. The alkaline batteries are still holding a good charge. The unit is powerful and performs well. We mix aluminum oxide crystals with face soap and the end result is a fresh, clean, polished, and youthful look.    http://www.doctoroz.com/print/44973    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CNWY1YY/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A3L1ANYJO7NZYB    I purchased an assortment of spray and pump travel bottles from the local dollar store that are used in this regime. After microdermabrasion I mist my face with Witch Hazel. After the misting drys, a transdermal application of freshly made L-ascorbic Acid serum (Shake well and refrigerate in amber bottle with eye dropper eight units distilled water - 4 units vegetable glycerin - 2 units L-ascorbic Acid)    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AYIM9ZC/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A8MA32QEVO3GI    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RT9JGK/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1    When the  L-ascorbic Acid is absorbed (after the tingling stops) an application of hyaluronic acid serum (100ml very cold distilled water vigorously shaken with one gram of  hyaluronic acid and refrigerated overnight) is applied.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GT4DL0W/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1    After the hyaluronic acid has been absorbed a final misting of Witch Hazel is applied.    Along with the external dermal applications mentioned above, we are also using Phytoceramides internally.    http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J2815SC/ref&#x3D;pe_385040_30332200_TE_item</li>

    <li> Teenage grandson using to keep his skin clear without buying a bunch of the facial products</li>
    <li> I love this face brush. It works very well. Just as good as the really expensive brands. I use the large brush for my body, and small brush for my face, with my normal face wash.</li>
