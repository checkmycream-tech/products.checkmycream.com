    <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and everyone looks for something different in hair products.  I have thin, kind of oily hair and have struggled with split ends.

This seems to be a suitable replacement and has worked well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this large bottle because the price/oz was almost as good as the smaller bottles.

    <li> The shampoo bottle spout came broken and shed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using their products for about 8 years now, and love them! I work in a steel yard on top of blacktop and it is one of the few products that I can feel a difference after washing my hair.I&#x27;m glad I ordered them this way, because to buy them in my area is about a 30 minute drive 1 way...</li>
    <li> Great Product&lt;br /&gt;Switched from a shampoo I have used for years with no regret</li>
    <li> I thought with a brand name like Sebastian it would be a product I would love but it wasn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t condition well.</li>
    <li> I bought these products for my niece and she loves it. She has been using it for years and years and very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Best shampoo and conditioneer I ever had.&lt;br /&gt;This combo is perfect for those who owns a hair dress saloon or also to leave it at home and do not worry when you have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and is strong enough to last until the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;If it rains on your hair with it, it enhances the smell for sometime.&lt;br /&gt;Just great.</li>
    <li> Not a fan.  After reading all the great reviews I was excited but not suited for my hair.  Rather harsh.  Thought it would be healing and gentle to my hair that got somewhat damaged recently.</li>
    <li> Love this product but to expensive in my area I was so excited to find it at&lt;br /&gt;A reasonable price</li>
    <li> Very nice... My hair loves it... Fast shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t purchase expensive hair products but this combo is an economical purchase and gives amazing results; I&#x27;ll definitely make another purchase when the time comes...</li>
    <li> Great deal on my favorite shampoo and  conditioner!</li>
    <li> This products are the best I&#x27;ve used so far. I&#x27;ve been using Sebastian Light shampoo and conditioner for like 2 years. Hair look great. Also I use celophane Sebastian once a month. So all 3 make hair shiny and straight (I have wavy hair). Works for me to get the look I want.</li>
