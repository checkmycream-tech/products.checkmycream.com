      <li>These worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great value - no problems.  </li>
      <li>A good deal, price wise, isn&#x27;t always the best deal when it comes to anything that has a shelf life, including batteries.</li>

      <li>Excellent product, fast shipping, great price - thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
      <li>Glad I came to Amazon.</li>
      <li>This might explain the \\&quot;outstanding deal.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Postage, mailing supplies &amp; labor must have cost more than the less-than three dollar price.  </li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>They seem to work ok and do the job.</li>
      <li>Apparently, 3 more words are required, but I don&#x27;t have 3 more words to say about them.</li>
      <li>Everything worked fine.  </li>
      <li>these are just the ones we needed and are working just fine.</li>
      <li>They could  not be found locally for a reasonable price, so this fit perfectly and we will be ordering again and telling our neighbors who have speedometers for their golf carts also.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see how they can be making any money at this price and free shipping.</li>
      <li>I make Amazon.com my primary go-to source for special buys now.</li>
      <li>They came quickly.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and was conveniently packaged for quick access.</li>
      <li>Order arrived quickly, well-padded in an envelope w/ invoice.  </li>
      <li>My math told me that it would be more economical to buy either a new calculator or go to amazon for the batteries.</li>
      <li>This particular one was a brand name and free shipping.</li>
      <li>so I am sure I will lose the second one before I need it again.</li>
      <li>Batteries are Maxell--not some weird unknowns, &amp; they worked perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Item arrived quickly and calculator worked again with the new batteries.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if this is some kind of a loss leader, although I haven&#x27;t received any other ads, but certainly recommend this</li>
      <li>Got on amazon and found lots of them much cheaper , but some were of a manufacture that I did not know of.</li>
      <li>It got here fast too.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>fast service.  </li>
      <li>thanks for making me write so much information on this request</li>
      <li>I received these batteries fast and in new condition.  </li>
      <li>Stores in the area were three times the price for one battery, but I was able to get two of them for less.  </li>
      <li>Cheaper than buying a new calculator.</li>
      <li>Battery was installed in a small pedometer &amp; lasted only a few months (instead of the 3-4 years I had previously enjoyed).  </li>

    <li> I received these batteries fast and in new condition.  Stores in the area were three times the price for one battery, but I was able to get two of them for less.  I would buy from this dealer again in the future.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a battery in my pedometer.  This replacement worked great and fit perfectly.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly. They came quickly. We are very happy with them. What more can I say? Apparently, 3 more words are required, but I don&#x27;t have 3 more words to say about them.</li>
    <li> These batteries are used in my small ohm and volt meter . They seem to work ok and do the job.</li>
    <li> The LR43 batteries arrived on time,and got my ProjectCalc calculator working again. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> This was purchased from \\&quot;Beach Companies\\&quot; (Las Vegas,NV) fulfilled via Amazon.  Order arrived quickly, well-padded in an envelope w/ invoice.  Postage, mailing supplies &amp; labor must have cost more than the less-than three dollar price.  Batteries are Maxell--not some weird unknowns, &amp; they worked perfectly.  Don&#x27;t know if this is some kind of a loss leader, although I haven&#x27;t received any other ads, but certainly recommend this deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7-1-13 UPDATE:  Battery was installed in a small pedometer &amp; lasted only a few months (instead of the 3-4 years I had previously enjoyed).  Remaining battery (unused) was also exhausted.  There were no expiration dates on the packaging.  This might explain the \\&quot;outstanding deal.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> as expected.  fast service.  will do business with them again.  thanks for making me write so much information on this request</li>
    <li> Great value - no problems.  Everything worked fine.  Saved about 70% compared to local drug store IF they had them.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, fast shipping, great price - thanks!</li>
    <li> I purchased these batteries for my project calculator. The batteries are the same that came original with the calculator; I priced these at Walmart and they were approximately $5.00 per battery, the calculator was only listed at $15.00. My math told me that it would be more economical to buy either a new calculator or go to amazon for the batteries. Glad I came to Amazon.</li>
    <li> small batteries are had to find with weird numbers,  these are just the ones we needed and are working just fine.</li>
    <li> These batteries were for the speedometer for our golf cart.  They could  not be found locally for a reasonable price, so this fit perfectly and we will be ordering again and telling our neighbors who have speedometers for their golf carts also.  The ease of ordering and fast shipment were great!!</li>
    <li> The batteries seem to work well. Now, lets see how long they last. A good deal, price wise, isn&#x27;t always the best deal when it comes to anything that has a shelf life, including batteries.</li>
    <li> A perfect fit for use in a Schwinn 12 function bicycle speedometer. Arrived quickly and was conveniently packaged for quick access.</li>
    <li> Replacement batteries</li>
    <li> The batteries arrived in perfect condition and as described. I installed the batteries in a clock and the clock again told time.</li>
    <li> Needed a battery but at the store they were pretty expensive. Got on amazon and found lots of them much cheaper , but some were of a manufacture that I did not know of. This particular one was a brand name and free shipping. It got here fast too. I can&#x27;t see how they can be making any money at this price and free shipping. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This battery went in a bike computer.  I could not find it anywhere locally but did not check a bike shop.  Anyway, it works well but comes with two batteries so I am sure I will lose the second one before I need it again. Other than that, all is well.</li>
    <li> Had a scientific calculator that ran out of battery. Opened it and it had two Maxell LR43s, so I ordered this Amazon. Item arrived quickly and calculator worked again with the new batteries. Cheaper than buying a new calculator.</li>
