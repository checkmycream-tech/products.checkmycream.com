<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I mix this with lavender oil and it helps to soothe the entire family to sleep (used in a separate squirt bottle). This is also our hand soap, mixed with sweet almond oil</li>
    <li> horribly drying. my face burned and peeled within days.</li>
    <li> Desert Essence is my favorite face wash.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years.  I love that the ingredients are natural and non-toxic.</li>
    <li> All organic nd huge bottle for a great price . Love it will buy again</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin drier than I wanted, but I still like it.</li>
    <li> Face feels great after using. The fishy smell gets to me sometimes, but no biggie!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve rarely had problems with my skin but in the past year I started to break out and pimples started forming under my skin. I went to get a facial and it resulted in apparent scarring and the blemishes didn&#x27;t disappear.  I was shopping for exfoliates and then I remembered I used to use this when I was younger and I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Literally one week after using it, my blemishes started to disappear.  This cleanser is so good you can feel the cleanliness of your skin immediately after you dry your face.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.  I had to write a review because this morning, the scar tissue from an old blemish that I had for 2 weeks! was gently shedding off my face after washing my face with this cleanser.  It is awesome and I will not stop using it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS I have sensitive skin and the ingredients of this face wash are all natural and top of the line.  The fact that the price is so low to me is phenomenal.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and will lcontinue</li>
    <li> NiceHappy with product</li>
    <li> Love this face wash.  This is the only thing I use to clean my face.  I have had acne prone skin in the past....it helps it quite a lot.  Delivery was fast and no problems with the bottle leaking.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Holy cow! My skin dried out a bit but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m bad and always forget moisturizer BUT!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This cleared my skin up in a day and the second time I used it  it cleared up almost all the way. My skin was going through some things girlfriend and this helped so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it like it says (twice a day, once In the Morning and then at night) and then at night Once I rinse it off my face i tap it on the parts that need it the most and leave it there until the morning. Girls best friend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 5 years for the sole purpose of having irritated/ sensitive skin. There is no other like it in the market. I love that it comes in a 32 oz  bottle.  So It last! All natural no chemicals or words you can&#x27;t pronounce.   Try it for yourself. You can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me... I have combo skin, seemed to get worse after about a month of use. Switching back to Proactiv!</li>
    <li> I use this product in the shower, tub, and skin for face and hands; makes me feel really clean, my face rarely has red marks of any kind now.</li>
    <li> This is a solid face wash right here. It has a nice smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin, and is all natural. I use it pretty much everyday. You only need a little bit in your hand, also. Just lather it up and work it all around your eyes for about a minute or so (avoid the eyes!). The directions say to rinse your face with cool water after using. You can do that, or you can wash it with warm water. I didn&#x27;t really notice much of a difference using warm water. But maybe it works better with cool water? Who knows. I just prefer warmth, alright?! :D</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  This has been my go to face cleanser for a few years.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin.  Also great to use for shaving legs since it won&#x27;t cause bumps.</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m so impressed that Amazon has my favorite face wash!</li>
    <li> Been using this for the last seven years. I had bad acne in my teens and an oily complexion from then through my mid-20s living in Phoenix. I&#x27;ve lived in Seattle since 2008, so I don&#x27;t get the oily complexion as much (weather here doesn&#x27;t make me sweat like the desert does). The year I used this in Arizona was awesome, and I think this stuff has been great for keeping my face clean and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the scent. When I used to smoke cigarettes, mouthwash and washing my face and beard with this was a killer combo for the last stop before meeting a significant other in bed. Many women don&#x27;t like smokers, and many dates couldn&#x27;t tell that I just had a cigarette because this stuff really cleans the smoke scent and leaves a very pleasant one in its place. If it can get rid of stale smoke smell, it works in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the 32-ounce bottle. I already had two smaller pump bottles (one at the sink and one in the shower) and they&#x27;ll last a while with this refill.. Little goes a long way--keep it out of your eyes!</li>
    <li> Recommend to put this in a foam dispenser bottle. It is a wonderful product. I use it on a loofah as a whole body wash. I actually really like the smell. Some reviewers have said it smells like dirt. I think it smells like fresh ginger or beet juice. It doesn&#x27;t make my face tight or super shiny after washing like most products do. It is very hard to find a product that does not contain sulfates, acids, or alcohol. And it&#x27;s very affordable! I will definitely be purchasing more of this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter.  She really likes it and we&#x27;ve noticed a difference in her skin.  You do need to have a foam soap dispenser for this.  I went to the store and got a cheap foam soap for a dollar, poured it out, washed the bottle, and used that.  Works great.</li>
    <li> A little drying, but nonetheless it&#x27;s an excellent cleanser for acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> Keeps acne at bay, but dries your skin, I add organic lavendar to the wash to help with breakouts.</li>
    <li> I originally found this product to be amazing. It helped clean my skin and was extremely affordable. For a while I just ignored and got used to the smell (which I hate) but recently I&#x27;ve noticed that I smelled a little funky at times. If I exercised, my pores emmited an unpleasant smell, which usually does not happen as I don&#x27;t sweat much. I&#x27;ve recently stopped using this product and I have noticed the smell problem going away. I can only say please for the love of societal convention change the smell of this product because I cannot bear the scent and neither can people around me. Otherwise it is wonderful. I am upset because I have over half a bottle left and don&#x27;t want to use anymore.</li>
    <li> I purchased a different brand of tea tree oil cleanser and loved the results. When I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find that same brand again so I chose this one. The reviews were good and the price was great. I immediately noticed how the consistency was much thinner than what I had been using. I would actually describe it as watery. Make sure you have your hand cupped or it will run right out. I have to pour a tiny bit at a time into my hand and repeat he process several times because it&#x27;s hard to prevent it from spilling out as I bring my hand up to my face. Becaus of this, I&#x27;m going through it very quickly. It also seems to be less potent as it doesn&#x27;t tingle much, and it doesn&#x27;t keep my skin oil-free like the other brand did. If you have super sensitive skin, this would be a good choice. Otherwise, I&#x27;d spend the money on a higher quality brand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hugeee Desert Essence fan and I tend to pick up their products in-stores. This face wash normally comes in 8.5 oz for about $8.99 on sale. Not terribly expensive but it does run out fast (the consistency is much like water, so I end up spilling quite often) and I dislike having to buy smaller bottles constantly (creates more waste). Luckily this was my exact face wash (love that tea tree, funny smelling but you get over it) but in 32 oz. I simply refill my 8.5oz bottle (with a pump) whenever it runs out and viola! I never have to worry about store runs if I run out. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because the color was slightly off (it was noticeably darker than the in-store stuff) but it still smells, feels and works the same so no biggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few tips if you&#x27;re beginning to use this particular face wash: as stated above it has the consistency of water, you can solve this by putting it in a foam-pump bottle or using a washcloth (I find this exfoliates much better than using my fingers, as it tends to just spill if I apply it with just hands). If you&#x27;re familiar with tea tree, then you won&#x27;t be surprised by the strength of the smell. It can bother some people but I&#x27;ve grown used to it and it&#x27;s not a big deal, it doesn&#x27;t take away from the effectiveness of the face wash. That being said, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, IT STINGS. A lot more than regular face wash for sure! As for acne, I notice my face stays very clear when I use it daily, I follow with a tiny dab of coconut oil (on my palms and then I &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; it onto my face) to moisturize and hello baby soft skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately a year now, and have no intention of using anything else. I live in a High Desert area, and have until now suffered from dry skin. Since using this face wash (and the Dessert Essence Liquid Soap, Castile) I no longer suffer from dry skin. In my opinion, humble as it is, this is pure excellence.</li>
    <li> Natural, nondrying, cleans great.</li>
    <li> Bought the refill and just put it in a small bottle I had leftover from something else. It works really well. Be prepared for your skin to &amp;#34;detox&amp;#34; a little for the first couple days, and then clear up after.</li>
    <li> Great feeling...........</li>
    <li> I cannot stress enough how much I love this face wash! I have been using it every night for the past 4-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Profile: my facial skin is normal/dry with moderate breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I started using this product, I was trying all kinds of face washes. My skin is normal/dry, but I do often have bad breakouts, with huge, deep pimples that scar my skin.  I just so happened to be browsing through whole foods and read the label, and thought I would give it a try. It was about $16+ a bottle, but it seemed good. After a few washes, it cleaned my face right up without leaving it dryer! (please also note that I use a Japanese nylon wash cloth to wash my face) The scent is not too overbearing - just smells botanical. I also love that there are NO chemicals in it - just a natural cleanser. It has evened out my skin tone, it feels exfoliated and smooth, and I rarely, rarely get breakouts any more. I also now only use a daily moisturizer and maybe blush when I go out - no need for make up my skin is so radiant! I get compliments all the time on how good my facial skin is, even in cold weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily when I was searching online, I found that vitacost had the cheapest price for it (even with shipping factors to Hawaii at the time included), and have been ever faithful after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest trying it out. I would give this product a 10 out of 5 stars. My only slight complaint about the product overall would be that I bought the smaller soap pump once, and the pump was not good - it wouldn&#x27;t pump correctly, so I would have to untwist the pump and pour it out (could maybe have just been that one bottle). But I have managed after all these years, and always buy the refill bottle, as it is always a great value</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the low  price. It is okay but it is very watery, smells like Murphy&#x27;s saddle soap, and dries my face out.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff.  Fast ship, very satisfied.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Used just twice. It works well and leaves the skin soft and fresh. Using it with the foaming dispensers, found on Amazon, made it awesome.</li>
    <li> I adore this face wash and was so glad to find it on amazon.  I used to purchase the 7oz bottle at my local grocery store but they stopped carrying the product line!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that I have combination skin with an occasional pimple.  I have always had a hard time finding the right face wash, either it is too gentle and my face doesn&#x27;t feel clean or it is too harsh and my skin feels tight and dry (then I have to moisturize and then I break out).  This product is the perfect solution!!  My skin always feels clean and soft.  When I do break out, I put a dot of this face wash on the pimple before bed and in the AM the redness is reduced and it is much smaller!  It does have a strong scent which reminds me of murphy oil soap (the wood cleaner) but I never noticed it lingering after washing my face.</li>
    <li> Great face wash. Been using for years to keep face clear.G</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! I&#x27;ve tried many different face washes for acne and I love that this is so simple and works extremely well for me. Unfortunately, it does have a strong smell while I&#x27;m using it, but it doesn&#x27;t last and makes my face feel super clean. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will definitely continue to buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Thoroughly Clean Face Wash for over a year now, and I won&#x27;t stop any time soon! I initially purchased it as a mild cleanser for some new piercings, but quickly discovered that it was great for my skin, too. Effectively cleans without drying my skin out. I buy the refill bottle and just fill up the original pump bottle I first bought--it&#x27;s cheaper and wastes less plastic. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought the refill bottle; shipping is consistently fast and gets to my door within a few days to a week.</li>
    <li> i bought this product because i found a lot of reviews that swore on this and wanted to give it a shot myself    first off my (face) skin is very very sensitive im asian and very fair if I get a bug bite on my face it is most likely to scar.. horrible right? anyways just wanted to let you know in depth what i meant by my face being sensitive.     i bought this and poured it into a travel size container with 2 drops of vitamin e. this is very drying for my skin. I used it once for about three days and noticed after each use my cheeks get really itchy and I just feel hot and bothered.    i stopped using it on my face because as much as i want my little acne to go away i didnt like how it was drying up my skin. ( i know i probably didnt give it enough time to adjust to my skin but I didnt want to risk that damage and in result maybe getting alligator skin on my face.. )    anywho I use this with my dove bodywash now. I squirt my dove body wash onto a loofah and then pour some of this onto the loofah as well then lather it up and give it a go. I find that it makes my skin really tight and dry if I use it alone so I have to use it together with my body wash.    moving on I have back acne gross I know but Its diminishing and I do believe it is this product. (why? ive been using the same body wash for two years and it has done crap for my acne but i use it anyways because i love dove and it is moisturizing...)    so yes I do think this is a great product if you do not have overly sensitive skin.     HOORAH!</li>
    <li> This wash is pretty watery. Slips right through your fingers when washing. The scent is also very strong.</li>
    <li> If you are going to buy this face wash, buy the 32 ounce size because you definitely get more for your money.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months and I really love it.  It is a little on the thin consistency side, but it doesn&#x27;t stop it from working up a good lather.  If you have sensitive skin like I do, please don&#x27;t give up on this if your face happens to break out after using it the first couple of days.  For some reason, any time I switch to a new face wash, my face rebels and breaks out for about the first week.  After that, it clears up and I haven&#x27;t had a problems since.  I did just find a new way to use this soap, besides washing my face.  I had a blemish on my cheek that um...how do I say this without being gross....it was swollen but without a whitehead.  I decided that after I washed my face to take a Q-tip and dab some of the soap on the blemish and let it sit over night without washing it off.  The next morning, it wasn&#x27;t swollen anymore, and I repeated the same process the next night.  It completely disappeared after that!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, this soap is that awesome that you can use it as a blemish treatment.    My husband even uses this as his body wash and he really likes it.  I will only buy this face soap from now on.</li>
    <li> great everyday face wash</li>
    <li> I used to use primarily Neutrogena face washes, and then I tried this at a friend&#x27;s house when I was visiting in CA, and got hooked.  Now, I buy it in the big bottles and won&#x27;t use anything else as a face wash.  I have combination skin which would be too dry if I used this wash without a moisturizer, so I use this in conjunction with Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer in the daytime and with the Jason Ester-C moisturizing cream at night.</li>
    <li> thank you!  This site is my personal thank you to the world&lt;br /&gt;thank you!  This site is my personal thank you to the world&lt;br /&gt;thank you!  This site is my personal thank you to the world</li>
    <li> Wawwwwwwwww, Thanks a lot for the amazing price.!! I cant fin like these price any where for this capacity.!!</li>
    <li> Great product for acne prone skin!!!</li>
    <li> This soap cleans the skin til it is squeaky clean, literally. I&#x27;ve never seen a facial soap work so well, highly recommended.   The product is thin in consistency and would be my only nit pick. Dr bonners tea tree soap is also, I&#x27;m guessing that is the nature of the beast. Perhaps the oil won&#x27;t blend with a thickening agent. Regardless it is outstanding.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years, and it used to work great. However, the company has changed the label and design of the product recently, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same. The label says it&#x27;s the same formula, and just a new look. But it can&#x27;t be the same. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as it used to. And when I compared the ingredients to the old style design, they seemed to be a little different.    I think it&#x27;s a shame that the company changed the product because it used to work so well. However, other people seem to be praising it, so I would say it&#x27;s definitely worth a try. Has anyone else noticed the product not working well since they changed the label?</li>
    <li> Pros: favorite cleanser to clean makeup brushes or makeup in general. This stuff strips. I use it sometimes when my face is crazy oily and/or horribly broken out and it does help. I would never use this twice a day, I would never use this in the winter. But it&#x27;s definitely become a staple in my bathroom. It does not break me out but it probably would if I overused it and didn&#x27;t moisturize.</li>
    <li> I love the earthy smell and the all natural ingredients in this face wash. Only problem is it dries the skin a bit.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of Desert Essence products. Started out using the blemish sticks. Haven&#x27;t had to use those since I started using this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend adding a few more drops( no need to drown in it, it&#x27;s potent and very effective) of tea tree essential oil if you have difficult acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been refilling a spray bottle that I keep in the shower with this soap for years now.  I love the size of this refill, it lasts me almost a year.  I use a spray bottle because the soap is too runny for a regular pump bottle and ends up oozing through the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this face wash because the tea tree oil helps keep my face clear and has a very clean astringenty smell to it.  It&#x27;s also not overly drying or harsh.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin.  Over the years I&#x27;ve use lots of different cleaning products for oily skin.  Many of them are terrible and dry your skin in places and make it less oily in others.  None of these product was worth the money and they are just large pots of nasty chemicals and dyes.  I saw this at TJs and it was inexpensive and I decided to try it.  I was pleasantly surprised at it&#x27;s effectiveness cutting down the oiliness without leaving dry patches.  My face feels fresh and clean without leaving any chemical or perfume smell.  My face does not have any tight feeling that other products leave. You don&#x27;t need too much to get a rich, foamy lather and it rinses off easily leaving no film behind.  It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product for several reasons.  It&#x27;s 100% natural.  The ingredient list is full of natural products, not a giant list of chemicals.  It is NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS so no animals suffered for this product.  It also contains no animal products.  And it&#x27;s so reasonably priced!  It doesn&#x27;t have any fancy name and price tag to match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I cannot claim that this is the best face cleaning product on the market, I can&#x27;t imagine any other product doing a better job at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I adore this and bought the face cleansing pads for my fiance as well. More liquidy then I thought but works great if you put it in a spray bottle. Has kept my face clean and I will only be using this product line from now on. Absolutely cannot beat. Also looked up the rating on the ThinkDirty App and it has fantastic reviews which is a huge plus for us.</li>
    <li> Smooth transaction - arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different face wash products over the years, and this one works the best for me.  Like its name suggests, it really does clean thoroughly!  I follow up with a mild toner and a good moisturizing cream, and my complexion looks and feels soft, smooth and healthy.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin.  TIP: I use the Phisoderm fragrance free bar first to get my makeup off. Then I wash with this after. Also, I use a gentle exfoliater once a week such as ST IVES. After showering I put pure vitamin E oil on my skin because the wash can be drying. I take a daily multivitamin and drink lots of water. My skin has dramatically brightened and cleared up tremendously. I have gotten so many compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;You get used to the smell after awhile. The best deal is to buy the 32 ounce and buy your own pump bottle to fill up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. Makes my face feel super clean without drying it out..</li>
    <li> While Pregnant, my skin was out of control.  But, despite my vanity, I refused to use chemical products on my body for the safety of my child (which paid off, I have a super healthy toddler now).  This was the only product that safetly and naturally controlled my excessive breakouts.  I still use it now, postpartum, and it continues to work for me.  It can be drying, so a good moisturizer is a must.  Try it with the cleansing pads from dessert essence.  Great for oily, problem skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a decade.</li>
    <li> I got hooked on this stuff over 2 years ago when I was working at Trader Joe&#x27;s. We originally carried the Desert Essence brand, then TJ&#x27;s relabeled it under their name (same stuff though). Until about a week ago, I had been using it daily. I went back to TJ&#x27;s to get another bottle and much to my dismay they stopped carrying it! I freaked out for a second but decided to head home and check Amazon. It took me a while to remember the original brand name but it came to me. STOKED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this stuff is great. I love that a lot of it is organic and natural. I RARELY get any blemishes (knock on wood) and when I do they&#x27;re easily handled with a Qtip and dot of warm water/tea tree oil solution (also from Desert Essence).</li>
    <li> Excellent and natural face wash. My son has oily skin and this face wash works best for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love dessert essence</li>
    <li> This i okay, but it seems to leave a film on my face.  I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing this product.</li>
    <li> its pH is 9 (I asked) which will throw off your skin&#x27;s acid mantle. Find something more acidic.</li>
    <li> My face felt extra clean, and revitalized after using this product.</li>
    <li> This is great soap. I use it 1/2 strength (mix with water) for daily use, in one of those dispensers that makes foamy soap. Works well, cleans without drying skin, smells fragrant too.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Products from This company. I love Desert Essence &amp; I&#x27;m an Esthetician!</li>
    <li> Terrible medicine, unnatural smell.  And the soap dries out my skin after two uses.  I just can&#x27;t get passed the smell</li>
    <li> I ordered this with the label shown on this page.  I got a bottle instead with a completely different label that said for \\&quot;oily and combination skin.\\&quot;  I could not find a single place in the text that had mentioned this.  I have very dry skin and this face wash dries it out even more, makes the skin itchy around the eyes, etc.  I would never have ordered this if I&#x27;d known it was not for dry skin.  I don&#x27;t know if I was sent the wrong product or not but you would think this information would be included in the text describing the product.  Please think twice about ordering this product if you have dry skin!</li>
    <li> This HUGE bottle works well, does what it should, and doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering scent. It leaves my skin feeling clean, but not tight and dry, and does seem to keep the oil at bay most of the day. I love it and will definitely order more!</li>
    <li> Dried out my skin and made me break out even more!</li>
    <li> Clean feeling face wash refill arrived in good time and product was exactly as advertised. I would recommend this seller and this product.</li>
    <li> This is probably the only beauty product where I&#x27;ve not switched or otherwise chased the next new thing.  I have complete brand loyalty to this face wash and even my boyfriend uses it now.  Not drying but totally removes makeup.  Burns like lava if it gets in your eyes.</li>
    <li> good product used it for years</li>
    <li> Although I&#x27;ve never had severe acne, I&#x27;ve had pretty regular moderate acne since I&#x27;ve gotten to college. I&#x27;ve tried an array of salacilic acid and benzoic peroxide face washes, and most of them didn&#x27;t appear to do much at all other than dry out my face. I&#x27;d heard that tea tree oil helped with acne, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a shot and it&#x27;s AMAZING! I&#x27;ve only been using it a few weeks and I can already see how much my skin has cleared up. I just bought this and a cheap foam pump from the dollar store (this face wash NEEDS to be used with a foam pump, the formula is made to be more liquidly than most other face washes) and it works perfectly! Not to mention it&#x27;s HUGE so it&#x27;s actually a better deal than a lot of the other face washes I was buying. Definitely a convert! :)</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews about this product that mentioned it possibly being a knock-off. I am now skeptical about the authenticity of this product, and am also curious about whether or not the things I don&#x27;t like are inherent to the product or if it&#x27;s due to some type of contamination or tampering with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has tea tree oil. I can smell the tea tree, so I know it&#x27;s in there. I like that it was such a huge bottle. I like that it foams up so well. I use it with a washcloth, so it lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I do find this to be drying to my face. I live in a very dry climate, so I need more moisturizer than I used to when I lived in a more humid climate (obviously).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash with this in the morning and then put on a pure honey mask in the shower (to restore moisture). I use a blend of castor oil/jojoba oil at night. It seems to keep a good balance.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have horribly sensitive skin. It is allergic to pretty much everything. Even hot water sometimes... However, I am not allergic to this stuff. It takes care of pesky acne and oil. Leaves my skin feeling very clean and it never dries me up. I have been using it for almost one full year and have had no issues. This refill bottle is an awesome price when you compare it to the MUCH smaller regular bottle.</li>
    <li> I got this product not knowing if it would work or not, and let me tell you I have used it now for alittle over a week and my face looks amazing and feels great. I am so happy I cant even tell you how great this product is. I am and I will buy this product again in the futre. And what a great price you cant beat it anywhere else. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been replacing other cleaners in my life with natural, safe ones and had yet to find a face wash suitable for me.  I have acne-prone skin.  While the sun and my diet naturally help me to keep them at bay, I do get a few once in awhile.  So I just opted for this after reading a few reviews.  I followed what one reviewer said about putting it in a bottle that helps to foam it and making it 1:1 (1 soap: 1 water).  I happened to find a sore throat spray container.  I emptied out the leftover medicine and am using it for this.  Works great!  The price is good considering how long it will last.</li>
    <li> A few people are complaining that this stuff is thin. But, if you&#x27;ve used this product for a while, you know the thinness doesn&#x27;t translate out to mean ineffective or \\&quot;watery\\&quot;. Also, it takes a few more rinses to get it completely off of your skin and away from your eyes. It will burn the crap out of your eyes just like any other soap. I may try what one reviewer said and dilute it. Sensitive areas on my face temporarily turn red, but doesn&#x27;t sting. Also, this stuff cleans very well and is pretty drying. So, if you&#x27;re like me with dry and sensitive skin, dilution may be necessary. I repurposed a dial soap pump bottle for use with the refill bottle. It works fine and only takes about two pumps to wash my entire face. I sometimes use it as a body wash, as well. It is very refreshing. The smell is something to get used to - like everything earthy, raw and natural - like sticking your face in tea tree mixed with mud and grass, and nothing sweet or synthetic. This is the real deal.</li>
    <li> It does dry out my skin a bit (tightens) but as soon as I apply moisturizer its fine.</li>
    <li> This face wash is perfect for my acne prone skin. It clears the breakouts fast without over drying my skin. The smell takes a little bit of getting used to, its not bad, just strong tea tree smell. Love this, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Fixed my pregnancy acne. Hallelujah.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I recieved it in a gift bag for my last birthday. I have been using it for about 2 months and it has completely cleared up my blemish prone skin. I am 26 and have teenage acne that developed into adult acne. This product is the only thing i have found that keeps my skin calm and clear. ( plus i am pregnant and wanted to use an all natural product on my skin) My husband commented on how he hated the smell, but I told him to take a close look at my skin and see if he saw any bumps. He immediately took the bottle from me and started using the product himself.We are both active duty marines, and he spends alot of time in the field covered with camo paint and dirt, and this stuff completely removes all the junk off his face and neck at the end of the day, and his skin improved so much after only 2 weeks of regular use. It can be a little drying, but i ordered the Desert Essence essential moisturizer and they work great together. A little goes a long way. I just ordered the 32 Oz bottle. But I still have alot left in my original pump bottle and that is after two people using it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I found it drying and a little irritating. It did nothing but upset my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also very thin and liquid, it takes quite a lot of effort to get it into a good lather. It smells odd, too, kind of like alfalfa hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I wasn&#x27;t impressed and likely won&#x27;t keep using it.</li>
    <li> Very good, clean wash. I don&#x27;t just use it for my face, but for any problem areas . . . if you have an injury, this stuff seeps to keep it from becoming infected, and if you have body acne this stuff clears it up, fast. Kinda drys your skin out a bit too, if you use it the way I do (mix with hydrogen peroxide in palm) but boy howdy does it knock out any dermal infections. It smells bad (according to a few of my friends and hubby) until you get used to it, but then very nice. Kind of like eucalyptis or something, in that it is a strong, unique smell. Anyway, I love it and it works well.</li>
    <li> it pretty good on my skin. I have dry skin and it works while with moisturizing.</li>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using the Desert Essence cleanser 2x a day for about a week and I can&#x27;t even begin to describe the wonders it&#x27;s done for me! I have blepharitis, an oily eyelid condition, and previous attempts to curb it with different facial washes, baby shampoo, and castor oil haven&#x27;t come anywhere close to this product! I haven&#x27;t used baby shampoo on my eyelids since using this product. :)  The only \\&quot;downside\\&quot; is that while the cleanser seriously cuts down on the amount of oil that comes from my face, it doesn&#x27;t treat acne in quite the same way that my previous cleanser did. But I just put on a 10% benzoyl peroxide spot treatment overnight and it fills in the \\&quot;gaps.\\&quot; :)</li>
    <li> I love this product for my oily skin.  I use it daily and with my Clarisonic Mia every other day.  My skin is cleaner and has a glow that I never noticed before.  I&#x27;m a huge fan.</li>
    <li> The only face wash I use. EVER.</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients as there&#x27;s tea tree oil that helps with oily skin. It does dry out your face so I&#x27;d recommend putting on lotion on your face right after washing. It lasted me about a year as this is a refill bottle.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best !</li>
    <li> This fash wash not only cleans your face completely but tightens up the skin giving you a younger more glowing appearance.</li>
    <li> this is by far the most watery facial cleaser i have ever used. eyes got irriated, face feels great after wash though. but it&#x27;s not gonna last me as long as i expected. 5% essence, 95% water?</li>
    <li> I used to suffer from horrible red rash around my nose and cheeks especially in winter. No more Rudolf nose.</li>
    <li> If you have chronic Rosacea I highly recommend this product to wash your face with. I haven&#x27;t used common ordinary bar soap in years. This has always been my first choice. A great wash for after face shaving too. You may not like the odor as most point out, but if something works it usually won&#x27;t smell like lavender or vanilla. Start out with a small bottle first just to see how your skin will react to it. But you won&#x27;t find your face feeling cleaner with this over any commercial grocery store bar soap.</li>
    <li> Although it has a strong tea tree smell, I feel that it is effective in getting the job done, whether for facial cleansing, body wash, even a liquid soap for when you wash your hands! This cleanser surprisingly doesn&#x27;t strip a lot of moisture away from your skin, which I feel is important to me since I have dry skin. I also have acne prone skin, and after a week or so of using this product I have noticed a decrease in flare ups. I especially, above all else, love this product for using all natural ingredients without any harmful chemical fillers. I hope this review helps gain some insight on this product. If you don&#x27;t mind tea tree smell, it is definitely worth the buy.</li>
    <li> Amazing face wash!!! Within three days my daughter&#x27;s face was completely cleared up! We&#x27;ve tried everything to get her acne under control and this was the only thing that worked! Plus the price is WAY cheaper!!</li>
    <li> This is a great buy! I was surprised when I received the product.  I didnt expect this huge bottle.  It is lot cheaper than the little one from WholeFoods.</li>
    <li> This face wash leaves my face so soft and clean!</li>
    <li> When you&#x27;re acne prone this wash is a total saver. My roommates girlfriend had problems with acne and then I turned her onto this and her skin is flawless now. It has tea tree oil which is the magic ingredient. I have been using it for years and would always buy it at Trader Joe&#x27;s but buying it in bulk saves me money and I can put it in a small travel bottle when counter space is a premium. This is definitely a staple in my skincare arsenal.</li>
    <li> This is our favorite face wash.  Great for men or women! Has a lovely scent and leaves skin feeling truly clean.</li>
    <li> Awesome for removing makeup without the need of applying a toner after cleansing. The only issues were; the smell which I have learned to tolerate and over usage can produce extremely dry skin, I recommend only using when you need to remove makeup in the evenings, in the mornings use something less harsh to avoid over stripping the natural oils on your face.</li>
    <li> I have adult acne and this is the only facewash I use, who needs all those crazy chemicals when you have this product</li>
    <li> We love this face wash!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! This has cleared up my breakouts and balanced my skin. (No more oily T Zone) I don&#x27;t mind the smell since I like the smell of Tea Tree Oil. Just buy this big bottle and pour it in a smaller bottle, that&#x27;s what I did. And my sensitive skin didn&#x27;t act up once!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and this gets ur skin really clean and is not too harsh. While Castille soap will not be too drying the tea tree oil can cause a little irritation so don&#x27;t leave it sitting on your skin if this happens. I really notice my skin is more luminous and tighter when I use this face wash.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve used! I tried everything from proactive to expensive ones but this one by far is the best.  My first reaction was why is this watery?  I thought maybe they sent me a wrong bottle but when poured some in my wet hands and started rubbing the cleanser, it started to foam really well.  Dont let the liquid form fool you! this soap laters really well on your face and a little goes a long way.  Its perfect for someone who are oily skin and breaks out on a regular basis.  After i wash my face this with, my skin feels so clean and fresh! It washes off all the oils, sweat,make up and dirt off your face.  I&#x27;ve been using tho product for 3-4days now and i am starting to see some fading in my acne blemishes/scars...my skins looks more even toned, glowing and less oily.  I am excited to continue to use this! I am also planning on buying pure tea tree oil and using it as toner to help with the results.</li>
    <li> Really great product.  Not only is it inexpensive but it works wonderfully and doesnt leave your skin dry.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking.</li>
    <li> Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash is the best, mildest, most natural face wash on the market. I have been using it for years. I&#x27;m 43 and people tell me all the time I look like I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s. You really must try it for yourself. You&#x27;ll notice a difference in your skin within a few weeks. In a pinch it can also be used as a body wash and hand soap. You could also brush your teeth...it&#x27;s that natural,  but it doesn&#x27;t taste good at all.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I bought a big bottle of this product and am very satisfied with it. I was a proactiv user for a long time but I wanted to change to a more natural cleansing regimen for my acne prone skin. After trying a few products I settled with this followed by natural toners and then moisturizer. I get compliments about my skin and sometimes people ask what I&#x27;m using. This product is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Very Inexpensive and Works Great! Just a bit makes plenty lather :)</li>
    <li> I love this product! Nothing else on the market has cleansed my face better than this product. It leaves no residue and leaves your face squeaky clean without the dry effect. I also use it on my back/shoulder where I tend to break out from time to time.</li>
    <li> I love the product!  The price was great and it was shipped promptly.  Thank you very much for the great customer service.</li>
    <li> I have a combination of an oily t zone and dry and sensitive everywhere else.When using this face wash, my face gets very clean without feeling stripped. It has a light scent that does not bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever. I&#x27;ve tried Neutrogena, Dermalogica, Peter Thomas Roth, Philosophy, Clinique, Origins, just to name a few. I will never need a different product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for about 6 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess I will start out by stating what my skin type is like. I have mildly oily skin with the majority of the oil just being on my T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). The rest of my face is mostly on the normal side. I usually break out on my forehead and chin. I get occasional breakouts on my cheeks as well. These are all mostly regular pimples or white heads. I do not get blackheads. My skin is not too sensitive. Now I will go into the pros and cons of this face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-The price is phenomenal! You get 32 ounces for about 12 dollars (I believe I saw it once on drugstore.com on sale for 9.99). I have had this face wash for about 6 months now and I am barely halfway through with using it. I think it will last another 7-8 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has all natural ingredients so you don&#x27;t have to worry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It removes make up relatively well (you still should use a make up remover wipe or something before you wash your face just to make sure there are no traces of make up left)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It removes dirt, oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has definitely helped with my breakouts. I used to have a few stubborn pimples on my cheek that never went away and after about a week of using this night and day they went away! They still come back every once in a while but nothing as bad as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-It is very drying!! I have somewhat oily skin and this still dried me out. Especially around my mouth. If I use it everyday twice a day for more than a week, it dries out the area around my lips. I would NOT recommend this for people with dry skin. If I can&#x27;t use a face cleanser on a daily basis without it drying me out, then it is not a good cleanser in my book. I bought this so I can use it everyday. And since I cannot I will most likely not be repurchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I understand this is a refill so I guess if you have the pump bottle then getting out the right amount would not be a problem. However, I didn&#x27;t have the pump bottle, so I had to get this out by just tipping it over and pouring just a tiny tiny tiny tiny amount in the cap and placing that into my hands (which are already wet) and lathering it up. Again, if you have a pump bottle, this will not be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is not the most pleasant thing in the world. For some people, it might smell really bad. But for me, I didn&#x27;t mind it too much. It was okay because as soon as you wash it off, it doesn&#x27;t linger. I know a girl who actually liked how it smelled. So it&#x27;s just different for everyone. And while it was not a deal breaker for me, I can imagine that it might be for those who are more sensitive to its scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a decent cleanser. I just think it is way too harsh. I think I can find something else with natural/organic ingredients that cleans just as well but still not be so harsh on my face. However, I do not think I will be able to find anything with a price as amazing as this because I have already looked into other organic/natural face washes that I want to purchase and all of them are much more expensive.</li>
    <li> Usually this brand is more on the expensive side, but this is a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around for a new face wash, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy a liquidy one, or one that exfoliates with a gel texture, or who knows. I needed a new face wash. My face is usually pretty clear. I think a lot of people over-exfoliate. I like this product because it isn&#x27;t too harsh. It&#x27;s got eucalyptus and tea tree oil, so it&#x27;s refreshing but natural feeling, though it doesn&#x27;t smell super good. It just smells like tea tree oil and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect to be able to use this bottle, you need the original bottle to refill or something! I put a different cap that fit, luckily.</li>
    <li> so far so good. have used it twice a day. seems to work well. we shall see</li>
    <li> This is my family&#x27;s favorite face soap. It cleans well, rinses clean, and leaves skin feeling refreshed. It does not dry your skin, and the slight tea tree tingle and scent are not overwhelming. You only need to use a little bit, so a 32-ounce bottle like this lasts quite a while, making it an even better deal.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash.  I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell.  It smells like saddle soap to me.  It lathers well and rinses well.  After two washings, all my makeup is gone and my face is squeeky clean.  I use it in the shower to wash my face, jaw line, and neck.  The 32 oz. bottle is a great bargain and another good thing about this product is the natural ingredients.  I will buy this again and recommend to others, but will also warn of the smell that I think could be improved upon.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. I expected an improvement in my skins condition within at least a few weeks but that didn&#x27;t happen. It was actually pretty drying and the smell is really strong.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was timely and and product size and attributes were as described.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it might work for others as an everyday cleanser but not for me.</li>
    <li> This makes my bad skin better unlike every other thing I have used.</li>
    <li> It left my face feeling the cleanest it&#x27;s ever felt...so I gave it two stars for doing what it says REALLY WELL. I will use the rest of the bottle eventually but only when I need my face REALLY clean. But i would not buy this again.  I really wish that someone would have pointed out how AWEFUL this smells. Someone called it &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34;....no.....it smells like a hippy that didn&#x27;t take a shower for a few months and rolled around in dirt. Also for a face wash it&#x27;s pretty thin and I had a hard time applying it to my face without getting it in my eyes. It absolutely burns worse then anything I have ever gotten in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great gentle face wash,  doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I used to pay $5 for a small bottle at trader joes until I found these reviews. Such a great deal from here!!&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out my skin but I put moisturizer on right away and it&#x27;s not a problem! Clears acne very well if used consistently.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great quality and has better ingredients than any drug store brand.&lt;br /&gt;WARNING-the smell takes a little getting used to and it will burn if it gets in your eyes but you will love this face wash!</li>
    <li> So the other day I was in the shower, and I noticed that my bathroom had been invaded by sentient octopi. Luckily, I had super clean and soft skin from using this awesome face wash. One look at my glowing complexion and they fell down in worship. Next week, I ascend to my new status as Cthulhu. A++ will by again.</li>
    <li> This face wash works well, even on my sensitive skin, but is hard to use because it is a very thin liquid, not a soap or gel.  Since I wash my face in the shower, it&#x27;s hard to keep this face wash from simply running down the drain:  I have to cup it in my hand like water and splash it onto my face, being very careful to avoid letting any run into my eyes because it does sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I have no complaints.  This face wash keeps my skin clean and relatively blemish free, a tough feat because I have sensitive blemish prone skin and spend a lot of time outdoors gardening and exercising, so my skin gets very dirty.  The soap does seem to have a slightly drying effect, so if I had very dry skin or was looking for a product that left my skin feeling moisturized, this might not be the right product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is priced very well.  This bottle will probably last me about six months.  I pour the liquid from this refill bottle into a soap pump and two or three squirts of the pump is more than enough face wash to do the job, even counting what runs down the drain.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash huge bottle will last longtime u only need one pump u need to put it in a pump bottle or u will waste it this is only face wash I&#x27;ll use now removes every trace of makes kinda stingseyes don&#x27;t get in them</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over ten years now and i truly believe it is the best. I have combination- sensitive skin which is very prone to breakouts . This product really gets all makeup and dirt off my face.i also use this product to clean my make-up brushes and nothing cleans them like it. Even though i highly recommend this face wash, I would not recommend it to people who have dry skin, or maybe i would with the provision to moisturize immediately after washing.</li>
    <li> I use this wash for face and body, and it is the only one I’ve ever used that does not leave some sort of film on my skin. I discovered this at Trader Joes about 4 years ago, and was so excited to find the perfect soap, for my face, and eventually started using it for my body.  I would buy 5 at a time, because I was worried such a great product may not be available again!  So, when they discontinued it, I researched to find this product only available on line.  I feel squeaky clean, and a little goes a long way. Because of the Tea tree ingredient, I have often used it as an astringent, soaping it on my face, and leaving it there for a few minutes, and it cleared up my blemishes, and those of my teenagers.  It might make body skin feel dry afterwards, so I do recommend a moisture lotion afterwards.  I like all aspects of this product, and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be very clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne all my life, and even though I&#x27;m in my 30s, I&#x27;m still not immune. Desert Essence face wash is the only cleanser that&#x27;s both gentle and effective in completely cleaning my face each night. Plus, it smells amazing and lasts for 6 months! What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;FYI: I always remove my makeup with castor or coconut oil before using any type of facewash. I also follow up with a witch hazel toner and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser....I would give it a 5 if it were slightly less drying....but it really cleanses quite well without a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This is great for every day. I find it helps prevent acne for my teen. It helps cold sores stop forming when the little tingle appears. It prevents any heat rashes. Mosquito bites itchy? Get this!  Seriously, what did I do before I discovered this?</li>
    <li> This is the third product I tried from Desert Essence, along with the Blemish Touch Stick and the Coconut Hand and Body Lotion and I really like all their products. I always do a lot of research before purchasing a personal care product and try to pick something that has as few chemicals as possible, but is at the same time not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has no Parabens, Phtalates, SLS, no artificial fragrances &amp; dyes, no Petroleum compounds. Instead it is loaded with extracts from many plants, such as Tea Tree, Calendula, Lavender and many others. It also contains Coconut Oil. All the above are ingredients that I have already used on my skin for various purposes and I know how wonderful they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 4 oz bottle that doesn&#x27;t have a pump, but it&#x27;s still not hard to use. I just need to shake the bottle a little and it only dispenses 1-2 drops every time. It takes very little to wash your skin, so I doubt I will have finished this product within 9 months (from opening). The thing about natural products is they last less, since they don&#x27;t have all those chemicals to preserve them for 1-2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big fan of the tea tree oil smell, but that is not a big inconvenient. I use a facial moisturizer that smells like citrus, so it covers the strong tea tree oil smell. I don&#x27;t have serious acne issues, but every now and then I get some pimples that drive me insane. This facial wash seems to keep the whole situation under control. They come and go, so this is definitely working. The Desert Esence blemish touch stick is wonderful to use with it. I apply it on the spot and within a day or two, it&#x27;s gone. I love how my face feels after washing it with this product. It feels clean and refreshed and not dry like it happens with other face wash products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for a few years now.  Excellent product.  I would highly recommend.  Don&#x27;t remember who I purchased it from, but it arrived quickly and it was packaged great.  No leakage.</li>
    <li> I was getting a lot of neck acne because I have course facial hair. This stuff is a lot better than using all that expensive acne medications and scrubs on the market. It is also a huge bottle and will last a long time. Just make sure you don&#x27;t get this in your eyes- I accidentally did and it seriously burned me. I&#x27;m ok now, and will use this when needed, but keep your eyes closed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 24 with mild acne and really sensitive skin which can be either oily or dry depending on the day. I like this face wash well enough. I put it in my own pump bottle and use a wash cloth to wash my face with it since it&#x27;s runny but I don&#x27;t mind that. I think the smell is pleasant. To me it smell nice a fresh, it reminds me the smell of tea tree oil. I&#x27;ve only used a couple of day but it&#x27;s gentile enough that I can use it morning and evening without over drying my skin. I will update when I see how well it works for my blemishes and such.  UPDATE: After using this for a week or two I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my acne and it did begin to dry me out a little bit after using it all the time so I&#x27;ve cut back to only using once a day or maybe every other day. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clear my face up at all but then again neither has anything else I&#x27;ve tried so that&#x27;s probably just me. Don&#x27;t let it discourage you because if your skin isn&#x27;t ultra sensitive like mine it may work you. I still love the smell and think it&#x27;s a decent cleanser but I&#x27;ll probably try something else soon since I&#x27;m still trying to get my face cleared up.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff for whole body or face.  Very invigorating.</li>
    <li> This is a good face wash and not extremely expensive, which is nice. Usually it comes with prime shipping too.</li>
    <li> This wash product is just great.  Cleans well and clears up any skin issues.  This refill is a cost effective and very smart idea for anyone who has a bottle and wants to save some $ on he smaller version.</li>
    <li> use all the time. nothing can match the squeaky clean feeling of my face. a little dry but i use vitamin A oil after. love it</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, adult acne-prone skin and was having trouble finding something that worked well as a cleanser.  For awhile, Alba&#x27;s Acnedote was great, but after I ordered it again, it seemed to make my skin worse.  I decided to give this face wash a try and have loved it so far.  The tea tree oil helps to dry up any blemishes, and despite that, it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face as a whole.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews of people who put it in a pump bottle dispenser, and while I&#x27;m sure that works great, I have had success with pouring a bit into my hand -- a little goes a long way for a good lather.  This refill-sized bottle will last me for a long time, so I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Overall, I really like this face wash, and I will be purchasing more when I run out. There are a few things I thought people might like to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is much thinner than other face wash products I have bought in the past, more of a liquid consistency than a cream consistency. As far as I can tell, it makes no difference, but it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The sensation after using this is more like a cleanser than it is like a moisturizing soap. It seems to wash off cleaner than a lot of other products. I&#x27;m not sure if this is something that everyone likes, but it&#x27;s something I noticed. Gives that sort of &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feel. I don&#x27;t really know a better way to say it, but I hope I&#x27;m describing it well enough for it to make sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Because of the thinner consistency and the size of the bottle, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to grab some kind of pump bottle to load this into. I know it&#x27;s technically a &amp;#34;refill,&amp;#34; but I never bought the original bottle, so I just made do with a drug store pump bottle. Trying to get a small enough amount to clean your face out of this larger container without wasting a ton might be sort of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I don&#x27;t really smell the tea tree oil. Most of what I pick up on is the awapuhi. I like it, it&#x27;s sort of a dry smell (makes sense for the name I suppose) but I agree with a few other reviewers, I wouldn&#x27;t get this for the sake of the tea tree smell.</li>
    <li> Love using this stuff as a daily face wash&lt;br /&gt;Great value&lt;br /&gt;Acne free 2 months now</li>
    <li> I bought this for my teenage son who is experiencing acne.  I didn&#x27;t want chemicals since he was already using acutane so I&#x27;d heard about this. He has used it for a few weeks now &amp; it seems to be helping considerably. This size should also last a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have a teenage son and he has been using this for the last 2 yrs.  It has helped tremendously with his acne and is not harsh on his skin.  I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Makes your face feel younger also makes you feel very clean. Its excellent qhen you put it in a foam pump because you bearly waste.</li>
    <li> Really is thorough cleaner. This is the only soap I&#x27;ve ever used that gets rid of my black heads. That said this definitely not light cleanser for dry skin</li>
    <li> So far so good. I am currently pregnant and the acne has been horrible. I got this looking to try something more natural, and in the last two weeks, my acne has definitely improved. We&#x27;ll see how long that lasts! It feels mildly drying in the moment, but my combination skin has not been red, flaky, or otherwise indicative of such a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not particularly fond of the smell, although I don&#x27;t mind tea tree, something else in this is mildly off-putting, but it&#x27;s not lasting and I don&#x27;t have an issue after rinsing. I use it in a foaming pump that if fill about 1/4 with water and this bottle is going to last forever!</li>
    <li> Its a really good peoduct.After 3 days of using it i noticed improvents on my face.I was not getting or those pimples that I was getting before</li>
    <li> Been using this as my daily face soap for years. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Does anyone now if this will strip my natural oil ? It seems a bit drying ):</li>
    <li> love it. leave my face silky.</li>
    <li> I know this is intended for the face, and for those who like a liquid face cleaner I&#x27;m sure this would be great. My preference to clean my face is to use a sponge with bar soap. I use this to clean my hands, in an empty dispenser for eyeglass cleaning liquid. The fragrance is just right for my taste (although I admit it took a little getting used to), and 2 or 3 squirts will suffice--so it&#x27;s economical as well.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this after reading all the raves!  My acne has not changed one bit after using this twice a day for a little over 1 month of consistent usage.  It is really great for taking makeup off, with only some eyeliner residual left behind.  Since it is cheap, this is a great alternative to cleansing oils, as the Origins brand is expensive and just as comparable.  It is best to transfer it into a foam pumper or else I really don&#x27;t know how others are managing its watery mess!  A little goes a long way (just one pump).  I still give it 3 stars since it does a good job taking makeup off and making your face feel clean.  I have yet to see any acne clearing benefits!</li>
    <li> Product is strong &amp; im not normally sensitive like that.. Live string scents!  But this gets my face squeaky clean and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all like some say.. Use it in my hands too while applying makeup.. Love it and so does my best pal I brave some to so she could try it!!</li>
    <li> I love buying the thoroughly clean wash refill off of amazon because it&#x27;s literally so much cheaper than buying it at whole foods or other places.  I just take the container and refill it here.  it&#x27;s exactly the same and keeps my face clean and clear.  It seems natural and good for my skin, and I know at least that it keeps my skin clean.</li>
    <li> It worked well as a cleanser. While it does smell nice, the scent was too strong for me.</li>
    <li> Wow! It completely cleared out my face. I was suffering from adult acne for over 10 years. Tried about everything on the market including very expensive prescription medications. Nothing worked until I tried this face wash. After just a couple of days of using it my skin started clearing up and now I am completely clear. My skin is glowing! I love it and I am a customer for life. What a great price for a miracle product!!!</li>
    <li> This product has a strong scent and cleaning effect while I am using it with a power brush on my face and neck.  I would recommend it at the end of a daily cleaning routine.</li>
    <li> excellent! It&#x27;s the second time that I bought this product.</li>
    <li> This def gets your face clean and minimizes breakouts. You also get a lot of bang for your buck. It may leave your face a little dry but that&#x27;s why you use moisturizer. Yes, the smell is strong when you&#x27;re using it but it goes away after you rinse it off. It&#x27;s not like your face will smell like tea tree oil all day. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have poly cystic ovarian syndrome and with that comes painful cystic acne.  I had tried every other facewash.  Nothing worked.  I finally tried this and I love it!  It smells a little earthy, but it will leave your skin feeling very clean.  Keeps my face clear. I buy once a month.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the combo of this and vitamin d-3 and an all-natural moisturizer; or just this wash alone that&#x27;s taking me on the verge of completely clearing my acne but I won&#x27;t complain and I won&#x27;t change my regimen - it&#x27;s working!  All-natural seems best for me.  If I see acid this and that on the labels of any product that concerns faces, I head for the doors.  I use this wash sometimes three or four times a day (which is totally against the recommended use of twice a day lol) - a complete minute of face massaging - and with at least three hour intervals. And I would strongly recommend moisturizing right after each wash.  EDIT (7/30/15): There is a hidden gem that I discovered and it is Argan oil. In fact, I credit Argan oil in healing/lightening my acne scars and preventing future breakouts including cystic acne. The Argan oil is the &amp;#34;moisturizing part&amp;#34; I stated in my original review and I dare say the oil is MORE instrumental in treating my acne than this DE Face Wash because it actually is more than a moisturizer because it also contains vitamin E and other things (like I said, it&#x27;s a hidden gem). All in all, the way to fight acne is to attack it locally (topically - direct skin intervention) and systemically (oral meds, etc.). Because if there is anything I have learned in school, it is that the exact cause of acne has not been ever singled out (i.e. is it hormonal, dietary, etc?). So I checked all the boxes. I took multivitamins especially vitamin C, zinc, and vitamin D. and used topically this DE Face Wash and applied the said Argan oil. I have had good results so I don&#x27;t mind sharing it with you all. I know acne sucks so bad. If my method can help someone else, great. If not, I wish you the best and good luck.</li>
    <li> I have been using tea tree oil for years and it is the only thing that keeps my face clear of blemishes.  I tried the benzoyl peroxide and Proactiv with no results.  Once I started using this face wash I have been blemish free.  It especially helped me through my early pregnancy acne.  I highly recommend tea tree oil if you are dealing with blemishes that don&#x27;t respond to the harsher treatments.  Yes, a $13 bottle can cure your problem and it lasts for a year!</li>
    <li> Although the smell is not the best I do enjoy washing my face with this. My face feels so clean after use. I just can not use too often due it drying my skin out a little too much.</li>
    <li> I have tried numerous products searching for one that won&#x27;t leave my face all flaky.  I am finishing up my first bottle of Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, and I have to say, it is the best out there.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a film, it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry or flaky.  And my acne clears up quickly!  It takes the dirt away while leaving my skin feeling smooth.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend at least trying it out for yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve slowly been replacing all of my skincare and household cleaners with more natural alternatives.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that I could get 32oz of organic facewash for this price.  I filled my used up (and much more expensive) pump bottles with this since it&#x27;s a refill bottle.  It cleans well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. This bottle is about 10 times the size of the ones sold at whole foods for the same price. Will be purchasing many times in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 40 year old man with super oily Italian skin. I&#x27;ve been using Desert Essence for a year and this is the best face soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It removes oil and blackheads like no other soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Nice face wash. Cleans well without drying and no breakouts.  Organic too!</li>
    <li> I have used this soap nearly exclusively for several years, and buying the refill size is a real bargain. I pour the soap into a foaming dispenser to make it last longer. The only downside is it burns if you get it into your eyes.</li>
    <li> First of all, you need to buy a foaming pump to use the refill size of this product or you&#x27;re not getting the most for your money! I read a few reviews saying they were just pouring it straight into their hand. This product is VERY liquidy, and you would be pouring most of the product down the drain with each use if you poured it straight from the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now for the review:&lt;br /&gt;I bought this back in November of 2013 and wanted to continue using this for a while so I could really give a good review. It&#x27;s now been 4 months of (mostly consistent) use so, this is my opinion for ya. Hope it helps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my foaming soap pump I originally poured this product in straight, no dilution. It has a very strong tea tree oil smell, it was..different, since most face washes are fragranced to be flowery and girly, but I didn&#x27;t mind. It washed away and didn&#x27;t linger. My skin was very clean after use. Squeaky clean, even! I immediately had to put moisturizer on or I felt way too dried out. I have combination skin so the dry parts seemed to get very tight and flaky, whereas the oily parts seemed…normal or on the dry side of normal. After a few days my skin freaked out and I looked like a lobster :( It was terrible! It cleared up, but it took around 3 days, during that time I had switched to using a sensitive Olay face wash, using it very sparingly and putting aloe on after (I mostly just splashed with water if I needed to refresh throughout the day). I was so upset that I, 1. looked like a lobster and, 2. couldn&#x27;t enjoy this product like the positive reviewers! It was such a good deal, I was so bummed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using this product because I was very wary about having my skin react negatively again. A few weeks later I was planning on writing a review for this, but instead I decided to read through some more of the reviews already here. I was hoping to find someone else who had a similar reaction and if they had tried anything to help. Well, a few mentioned diluting the product with water. DUH! Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?! I went on to dilute it to a 1:1 ratio, a few uses later it was still too drying for me, so I added even more water (it&#x27;s probably now a 3 or 4:1 ratio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming action of the pump is really so helpful, 1. You&#x27;re not wasting product, which is awesome. 2. You don&#x27;t need to make the lather, it&#x27;s already there! It&#x27;s nice when you&#x27;re feeling lazy and just want to go to bed, but you know you need to wash your face first 3. You&#x27;re diluting it, so you&#x27;re going extend the life and use of this huge refill bottle. I haven&#x27;t needed to buy face wash since I bought this, and I won&#x27;t need to for quite a while. The original bottle looks like I haven&#x27;t even used it. I use this face wash almost everyday (I did have another face wash I was using along with it occasionally). I only need 2 pumps to have enough lather to clean my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes off facial make up pretty easily, but I do NOT recommend using this on or around your eyes. I can&#x27;t say much about this face wash clearing acne or anything, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement…but I also haven&#x27;t seen any adverse reactions with the few pimples I do get. Honestly, I *would* repurchase this because it was such an awesome deal and I finally figured out how to make it work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR / The Short Version:&lt;br /&gt;*Very liquify, not a gel&lt;br /&gt;*Buy a foaming soap pump&lt;br /&gt;*Dilute, dilute, dilute&lt;br /&gt;*Lasts a very long time&lt;br /&gt;*Can be drying&lt;br /&gt;*Didn&#x27;t notice it helping OR hurting pimples&lt;br /&gt;*Smells very strongly of tea tree oil, but it does not linger once washed off&lt;br /&gt;*I feel that it is a great deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)mentioned diluting the product with water. DUH! Why didn&#x27;t I think of that?! I went on to dilute it to a 1:1 ratio, a few uses later it was still too drying for me, so I added even more water (it&#x27;s probably now a 3 or 4:1 ratio)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foaming action of the pump is really so helpful, 1. You&#x27;re not wasting product, which is awesome. 2. You don&#x27;t need to make the lather, it&#x27;s already there! It&#x27;s nice when you&#x27;re feeling lazy and just want to go to bed, but you know you need to wash your face first 3. You&#x27;re diluting it, so you&#x27;re going extend the life and use of this huge refill bottle. I haven&#x27;t needed to buy face wash since I bought this, and I won&#x27;t need to for quite a while. The original bottle looks like I haven&#x27;t even used it. I use this face wash almost everyday (I did have another face wash I was using along with it occasionally). I only need 2 pumps to have enough lather to clean my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes off facial make up pretty easily, but I do NOT recommend using this on or around your eyes. I can&#x27;t say much about this face wash clearing acne or anything, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement…but I also haven&#x27;t seen any adverse reactions with the few pimples I do get. Honestly, I *would* repurchase this because it was such an awesome deal and I finally figured out how to make it work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR / The Short Version:&lt;br /&gt;*Very liquify, not a gel&lt;br /&gt;*Buy a foaming soap pump&lt;br /&gt;*Dilute, dilute, dilute&lt;br /&gt;*Lasts a very long time&lt;br /&gt;*Can be drying&lt;br /&gt;*Didn&#x27;t notice it helping OR hurting pimples&lt;br /&gt;*Smells very strongly of tea tree oil, but it does not linger once washed off&lt;br /&gt;*I feel that it is a great deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I would give this 5 stars but it is a bit drying when I use it with topical acne medication.&lt;br /&gt;However, when I use it, I can feel the difference in my skin. My acne is visibly cleared and the whiteheads on my chin disappear.&lt;br /&gt;I do not use it in full concentration, diluting it with water is the way to go.  Also I lather before I put it on my skin, and I only keep in my skin for less than 5 seconds, which is why I have yet to experience significant drying. I&#x27;ve even lowered the dosage of my acne medication while using this and I&#x27;m still getting wonderful results!</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I received this facewash and was excited to use it because of the tea tree. I was so wrong! It was so watery im not sure if that how the product should be. I washed my face with it anyway. It had a terrible smell and  not to mention after using this product for a week my face started to break out terribly. I have extremely sensitive skin that is prone to scaring. Now I have to start ALL over again because my skin had that much of a terrible reaction. I would recommend everyone to STAY AWAY from this facewash if you have sensitive scar prone skin.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is excellent for the body. I have acne on my back and arms. I used this soap with a cleansing brush, and it looks SO much better! It is great for the body. However, I have super sensitive skin and used this on my face and it made it peel like crazy. Even some spots that were okay peeled, which caused some irritation. If you do use it on your face, make sure that you use a very small amount and that you only use it if your  skin is crazy dirty and filthy. It will get it SUPER CLEAN with no dirt left.</li>
    <li> Great product that lasts forever. I buy one every year and half or so.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s busy, active in sports or just enjoys a clean face. This product is great, it your face cleans well, can be used everyday without drying the skin and removes all dirt so no toner is necessary after washing your face. Grab a travel size bottle and take some with you. Just DON&#x27;T EVER let it get into your eyes!</li>
    <li> This REALLY dries out my skin and leaves a film of something on after I wash my face. I wanted to try this because I used to be in love with their face pads but they changed the ingredients at the same time they changed the packaging, and now they both are not good. They only use the very least amount of tea tree oil they can get away with because you cant smell it at all.&lt;br /&gt;I now only used this as a body and hand soap just so I don&#x27;t feel I totally wasted my money.</li>
    <li> Gentle, very effective, cleans well. Leaves surprisingly non-greasy results.</li>
    <li> i love this so far. it removes make-up (foundation and powder) in one go without the tight drying feeling. The fact that its has natural  ingredients is a bonus and as the other reviews say - it&#x27;s best to out it in a foam pump jar - you get more value out of it that watt.  This size is also value for money. I also use it as a shower gel.</li>
    <li> This works just as good as Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Acne Stress Control, without all of the chemicals. I&#x27;m almost 30 and started to question why I was still washing my face with acid. I figured it was time to get away from the acne washes. My face feels clean and fresh after using this. I use it once a day (in the morning) and use Cetaphil before bed so as not to over-irritate. Good for back, chest, really anywhere that is oily. It&#x27;s a potent cleanser--a little goes a long way. If I use 2 pumps with a foamer every day, this bottle will probably last me until I&#x27;m 60. In my opinion, you have to use this with a simple, cheap foamer. I washed one from my old face washes out and have been re-using it and it works perfectly. If you don&#x27;t use a foamer, you&#x27;re just going to be wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positive: Cheap considering how long it will last. No chemicals, but I&#x27;m not an expert on that. I mean, I figure it has to have less than the other crap I&#x27;ve used. It cleans my skin really well without making it chapped, dry, flaky, etc. Actually, I think the Cetaphil for oily skin is more drying than this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: While it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, it is potent, and you shouldn&#x27;t over-do it with this. 2 pumps with a foamer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: It does make my face a little red. It&#x27;s not a chapped or irritated red, it&#x27;s literally just like my skin is a little flushed after I use it. Your milage may vary.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I developed acne at 16.  I&#x27;m 28 now and haven&#x27;t had any since.  Try it.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day atleast twice a day I have sensitive oily acne prone skin this is far best the product i have purchased for my face.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash!  My face is very sensitive and easily breaks out and I cannot use a lot of soaps but this works very!</li>
    <li> Wonderful face wash. We have used it for years.  The tea tree oil makes it both refreshing and extremely effective.</li>
    <li> It is amazing!! My teenagers love it!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product!  Not only is it mild enough for my face, I use it for my hair and body wash.  Leaves my hair bouncy and not weighed down.  Customer for life!</li>
    <li> big refill. will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. after living in NYC for four years my skin was more breakout prone. A dermatologist told me I had acne but after cutting out sugar and using dessert essence tea tree oil face wash I have no pimples and a nice healthy glow. my skin is the best it&#x27;s been in years... I swear by tea tree oil face wash and vitamin e / coconut oil as a moisturizer. Stop giving your money to dermatologists and use this product!!</li>
    <li> Does wonders for the skin of a sixty year old man.</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this face wash! It leaves you clean and refreshed. My skin feels wonderful. Believe it or not I also use it on my dogs. They love it, no more itching! Product is A+ and one that I will always keep on hand.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash we use.  It also can double as body wash and shampoo in a bind.</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as planned.  Soap is great and my skin feels good after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I had a positive experience.</li>
    <li> I really like this hand and face wash</li>
    <li> I used the Burts Bees Natural Acne Solutions line for a while, and although I really liked the products they were just too expensive.  I decided to switch to this face wash and am so glad I did.  It&#x27;s a great value and a very effective product.  Plus, it has simple natural ingredients.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year and my skin seems well-balanced with even color.  I don&#x27;t think the smell is very noticeable at all.  I put it in a small glass pump bottle and use one pump of liquid to wash my face in the morning and again at night.  Lathers up nicely and washes away leaving my face clean but not dried out.  I have combination skin in the winter but generally oily skin the rest of the year and this face wash is perfect.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I found this while looking for natural cleansers for my face. It&#x27;s completely natural and vegan, with none of the chemicals and gunk of the more familiar popular face washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this giant bottle for the price save and then pour it into a smaller squeeze bottle I keep by the sink. The big bottle lasts me about 5-6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap itself is pretty watery, which is a little different at first if you&#x27;re used to the usual thick face washes from stores. I just make sure to cup my hand with my fingers closed and squirt a little right in the palm. It suds pretty nicely, considering it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemical agents in it. It has a really light, crisp, refreshing scent - almost like a faint pine woodsy type smell. It makes my skin feel kind of invigorated and a bit tingly, but rinses away incredibly clean - almost squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as I was facing a really bad battle with acne which required dermatologist appointments and blue and red light laser treatments. I had really bad cystic acne, as well as scarring. I did not want to add anything harsh to my skin or put lots of drying chemicals or medicines on my skin. I simply wash with this once in the morning and once at night. Once in a blue moon I use a spot treatment. But my skin has cleared up completely and I get compliments on it all the time, people are shocked at the different a year has made. I usually pull this big bottle out and show them and read the label about it being all natural and vegan. I will never go back to drug store type brands of face cleansers, they really just add to the cycle of the problem and don&#x27;t help. Natural is the way to go, and this is definitely a great cleanser to have.</li>
    <li> This face wash reminds me of the $5.99 wash from Trader Joe&#x27;s. My skin feels clean, clear, and fresh after using this product, it&#x27;s affordable and consistent.</li>
    <li> Not overly drying, put it in a washed out foam hand soap pump and it comes out in a great foam that&#x27;s easy to apply.  Amazing product, I&#x27;ve already made a second purchase to be sure I don&#x27;t ever run out!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My favorite face wash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6~7 years!&lt;br /&gt;affordable price, good quality, good for sensitive skin, not-tested on animals, etc.</li>
    <li> I love it, it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft.  It is also very clean smelling. A little goes a long way.  Just make sure you do not get it in your eyes because it stings.</li>
    <li> I was originally really excited about this product, then I tried it for a week. It does NOTHING for my skin. It actually leaves me feeling oily after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldnt recommend. Twas a waste of money IMO</li>
    <li> Nice amount for the price but i can&#x27;t get use to the smell.  The scent of the cleanser is very harsh, the more i used in the morning the more difficult it was to take the smell.</li>
    <li> I love how clean and fresh I feel after using this. If you have problem skin, this will help clear it up without drying it out. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I am loving this cleanser. Smooth skin. No breakout. The best cleanser so far.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, she likes it too.</li>
    <li> Was hoping to save time with a natural face wash vs the oil cleansing method but I ended up breaking out horribly. Where I didn&#x27;t have breakouts I had dry patches. Not good. Plus it really stinks. Stay away from this one.</li>
    <li> nice face wash may be a little drying at first use every other day, helps to clear complexion, smells clean, very large bottle. liquid is watery, I put it in a foaming pump bottle so now it comes out a foam and is much easier to use.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and I tried using this on my entire body rather than just my face. It works wonderfully, smells pretty good and leaves me feeling very clean. It is not drying at all.</li>
    <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve always had a great experience using it. It cleans my face very well and helps prevents breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is my bathrooms&#x27; sinks soap. Everyone who has used Desert Essence in my house seem to like it, everyone leaves the bathroom, smelling their hands and asking what kind of soap is that in your bathroom? I showed the bottle and let them know I bought it through Amazon. When I&#x27;m running out of dish soap I use Desert Essence as a dish cleaner, too. Satisfied with my purchase, even though the price has gone high.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this face wash and I trust the brand. It lathers really well, and I only use a tiny bit each time I wash my face. My skin responds very well to it, though I have found that when I only use this twice a day for several days straight, my face gets a little drier than normal. I&#x27;ve developed a routine where I use this once a day and a homemade natural cleanser once a day. It seems to be a perfect balance for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is less expensive that the artisan cleanser I use, so using each once a day is a lot more economical and I get the best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Store in a cool dry place, for sure, because a bottle this big will last for ages. You don&#x27;t need much to get a very thorough cleansing. I also use it on the back of my legs, where I tend to get ingrown hairs, and it seems to help keep my skin bump-free.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a product work this well. Dude. It actually works - incredible! I like that I&#x27;m not putting crazy stuff on my face.It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and keeps acne at bay the best I&#x27;ve seen. And the huge size has lasted me well over two years. It lasts forever! Incredible deal!</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this item for myself b/c I have sensitive skin and it works well leaving my skin refreshed but not dry. My family members came to visit and fell in love with the product as well. I like that the product is all natural and I am converting my friends/family to all natural body products. I bought the 32 ounce one for my family to share, it is more cost effective to purchase the 32 ounce refill. Try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I wanted to wash my face daily with at least one product that doesn&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, this does that very well.  I don&#x27;t have terrible acne, and it seems to work fine.  You also get a good value with this refill bottle, just put it in another container and you&#x27;re all set.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! And the shipping was very fast!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells fantastic. Light and clean and not overwhelming.  The seller was prompt and the items came very well packaged. Have ordered this product twice now from this seller.</li>
    <li> Been using about 3 weeks. At first things weren&#x27;t going well but after changing moisturizers, it seemed to work better. The tea tree oil really leaves it smelling good but I do think it&#x27;s drying and definitely neeeds to be followed with a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I tried Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean face wash after getting nowhere with any of the major brand face washes on the market. I chose it mainly because it contains tea tree oil, my latest strategy for battling acne-prone oily/combination skin. It has really done wonders in the 3 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, and I have noticed that my skin really &amp;#34;glows&amp;#34; for the first time ever! I don&#x27;t get as oily during the day, and have had less of a problem with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally like the smell of tea tree oil, so that doesn&#x27;t bother me, but it is definitely there. Also, don&#x27;t get it in your eyes, it will sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love what a great value this purchase is! It is meant as a refill bottle to pour into a smaller, foaming dispenser (which I did not have handy). So I just poked a hole in the foil seal on top of the bottle, splash a very small amount into my hand, and rub vigorously between my palms to foam it up. It is plenty for your whole face, and no extra apparatus required.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash with tea tree oil!  I love this because  safe and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Nice to have a product that doesn&#x27;t cost a zillion dollars and you only get a ounce. Works great as well.</li>
    <li> Really like this stuff</li>
    <li> i like the way it makes my face feel. I have acne prone skin and i dont get break outs anymore. i like  the fact that its more natural and its less expensive than those face cleaners in the store. the smell is refreshing. im a life time user.</li>
    <li> Absolute best way to wash your face. I use this at least twice a day, year round and my face always feels great and I have almost no issues with oily skin or breakouts. Smells amazing. And of course, no crappy chemicals reside here.</li>
    <li> I tried this out this summer in a smaller pump bottle and really like it, so I was so pleased that when the level was beginning to get low this option of a 32 ounce refill became available.  It is a most effective cleanser which is lightly (seemingly naturally) scented {if you have ever smelled Tea Tree Oil, you will know what I mean when I say it can be overpowering.}  I kinda like the smell, though others may not, so do as I did &amp; try the regular size first, if you are worried. Very nice, high quality product, good value, and quick delivery!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It smells absolutely horrible..so bad that after the first time I was going to return it. But I sucked it up and kept using it. The strong smell died down and it actually leaves my face feeling incredibly clean! Its sooo natural and only has good ingredients in. You feel very good about using it and bc its so big this is probably the only facewash you&#x27;ll need in a year!</li>
    <li> Since using this wash, my acne has gone down about 75%, no other changes in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 36 year old male who has suffered mild to moderate adult acne. Tried other products and dermatologists to no avail since high school. I use a foam dispenser, this thing will last at least a year. Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I have a combined oily/dry skin. I purchased this produce based on the great reviews. I LOVE it. It is watery but lathers and cleans beautifully. I do use a little coconut oil around my eyes after I&#x27;ve cleaned my face not that I really need it but because I&#x27;m not a young chick without wrinkles or bags and I&#x27;d like to keep them at a minimum if possible.&lt;br /&gt;This face wash has a nice fragrance and the price is very good. I bought the 32 oz. refil because I already have some pumps for 32 oz bottles. It takes very little product. I use a face brush so I apply a little product, then use the brush wet. I get lots of lather and such a nice clean feeling afterward. And it scrubs makeup right off. I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Lid was cracked and it was spilling when arrived in box.. Also stings your eyes.</li>
    <li> I appreciate that this is all natural. I&#x27;ve been trying to use less products with weird chemicals/plastic beads. Before this, I was using Clean and Clear. Then I tried an all-natural Dead Sea salt bar of soap for my face and I liked it, but it was $4 for a bar and bars don&#x27;t last long.    The smell of this is a deal breaker for me. My girlfriend isn&#x27;t going to want to come near me if my face smells like what I imagine the inside of a cactus to smell like (maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called \\&quot;Desert Essence\\&quot;). I also found it to dry out my skin. Maybe my face is dry because of the cold weather. Maybe it&#x27;s both reasons. I don&#x27;t have very oily skin and I haven&#x27;t particularly struggled with acne. I was just looking for a healthier alternative. I will keep using it for now to see if it clears my face. But I will probably look for something with a more pleasant (or neutral) smell.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have tried giving this product a chance for two weeks now.  While our skin looks great - we can barely stand the smell of this!  It is horrible!</li>
    <li> lasts for a while but too strong for my sensitive skin</li>
    <li> Does not have a drop of tea tree that I can tell does feel that good soap not impressed just gonna throw as not worth returning</li>
    <li> Your opinion of this face wash will be based on your skin type. I have average sensitive skin and this burned. It seems kind of harsh (the smell is kind of harsh too) even after I watered it down quite a bit.</li>
    <li> I used to suffer from the embarrassment of acne and acne scars! Not anymore thanks to this face wash! I tried almost everything, including proactiv and other expensive cleansing systems. Someone recommended this one and within weeks, my face cleared up completely.  It leaves your face feeling clean and oil free! Love it. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for years.  It really helps cleanse my combination skin without overly drying it.</li>
    <li> This face cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I wanted a product with tea tree because I am prone to breakouts. This cleanser has kept my face clear and clean :) And what a great value...this bottle will last me awhile!! Highly recommend this cleanser for any skin types.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a number of years after finding it at Trader Joes.  I have Rosacea which can cause pimples and scaly skin on the forehead and around the nose.  This product has been very helpful in controlling these and keeping my face clean and soft without feeling tight.  TJs recently stopped carrying it and I&#x27;m glad to find it here.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an all natural alternative to my gentle facial cleansers so I found Desert Essence products and decided to go all-in and order the big bottle (since it seemed like a great deal for so much face wash) as well as the face moisturizer and the facial scrub.     Let me tell you, I had no idea what was coming to me when I started this regime, but I am very impressed with the results! I love how I can really feel the tea tree work on my face, like a light astingent in the cleanser. I actually repurposed a foam hand soap dispenser and put about 1/3 full of the face wash and 2/3 with water and pump about 2 pumps into my hands to wash my face squeaky clean. I am in my mid 20s and have gotten so many compliments on my skin since starting this about 5 months ago. I love how the tea tree in the facewash and the jojoba/ aloe vera in the moisturizer work with the natural oil balance of my face to prevent breakouts and oily skin.    On another note, I decided to try to be more natural with my haircare as well and while camping I decided to go ahead and wash my hair with this facewash. It is definitely not for every hair type, but I have medium thick, oily hair, and it gave me tons of body and took away the exessive oil! Now, I will do a rinse with this product on my hair once every few days before my other natural shampoo and I feel like the tea tree really cleans my scalp of all impurities. I also use it as a body wash in the shower and I love how the tea tree is an antiseptic so I feel like I am getting really clean, especially after working out and getting sweaty.    After using it for multiple purposes, daily, for about 5 months, I am still not through the whole bottle! You don&#x27;t need to use very much of it for it to be effective, so this big 32-oz bottle is the best deal on face/body wash you will ever find!     I love love LOVE this product and will reorder before I run out of it because I am now addicted to this stuff!</li>
    <li> The whole family loves this stuff. We use for both face and body. As other reviewers have said, it is a thin, watery liquid rather than thick and syrupy like most face washes. We bought a foaming soap pump, filled it about 1/4 to 1/3 with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash and the rest with water. It can be drying for skin that already tends to be dry, or the dryer areas of combination skin, but diluting it in the foaming pump has helped eliminate most of the drying effect. My family tends to have more oily skin anyway, so it works great for us. We&#x27;ve been buying this face wash for about 8 years now, since I first found it locally in a small 8ish ounce pump. When I discovered this 32 ounce refill size on Amazon for only a couple dollars more than I paid for the 8 ounce size, I was super happy. Paired with the foaming pump, this will last my family several months.</li>
    <li> great product, good price</li>
    <li> Ive had eczema and acne most of my life and because of it have had to be very careful about the facial products I use. This stuff so far (Ive been using it about a week) is great. It doesnt leave an oily residue on your face or dry it out. Thats a very hard balance to find with me especially during the winter. It is also very gentle on sensitive skin which is a must for people with eczema. The only downer was I had to find a foaming dispenser in order to use it the right way but I just washed out an old hand soap one and Presto! (im cheap) Another big plus is the price. Usually for a product like this )not to mention the amount you get) Id expect to pay at least $40 while I paid around $13 and it&amp;#34;ll last me about 2 months. Nice. Bottom line its worth a try. I hope it works for you!</li>
    <li> Very watery and smell really bad! Don&#x27;t wast your money!</li>
    <li> Hands down best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. Is great for acne prone skin keeps acne at bay for the most part.</li>
    <li> If you dilute this product and put it in a foaming pump bottle it&#x27;ll last you YEARS. I had this one bottle (not diluted) and it lasted me over a year and a half.</li>
    <li> used it about a week and seems to be fine. seems kind of watered down than other facial cleaners I have used.  Changed my rating to 5 stars. After using this for over a year my skin has had the fewest breakouts since I started getting acne. I started to put it in a foaming pump dispenser and it lasts alot longer. ordering another bottle and will continue to use this because it works for me!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, love the way my skin looks and feels afterwards. Your face will feel tight and a little dry afterwards but that is usual for most deep cleansers. The smell is not as off putting and stated in other reviews, i find it refreshing and earthy. Will be purchasing again, but i&#x27;m sure this bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cure skin ailments, but it does leave your skin super clean and totally refreshed. If you like natural skin soaps and stuff, this is a great one to try.</li>
    <li> Really like this organic alternative. Smells great too. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Ok I&#x27;ve had this  product for  a little over two months, and so far :my sensitive skin has improved ,and I feel like  its balanced out if I skip a day I don&#x27;t get an imeadiat  break out  if I forget I washed my skin and wash it twice it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  And  again no parabens. Phylates , sodium laurel sulfate ... Its pretty darn natural  and the  bulk size just adds to. The value, even though a little goes a long way.the only think I would. Recommend  is since it is a liquid cleanser not a gel or goop , to get a good foaming  pump bottle  or a loofah ( the gentle kind your can use on your face)</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for the past two years on my picky combination skin.  When I first started using it, I only used my hands and this soap to wash my face, then I started using the soap with a washcloth, and I&#x27;ve recently started using it with a Buf-Puf.  This soap does a great job at removing face makeup (primer, foundation, finishing spray) but since it stings a little, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to get eye makeup off with this.  To remove waterproof eyeliner and mascara, use an eye makeup remover prior to washing your face with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little drying if you use it in conjunction with other oil/acne control products (benozyl peroxide especially), so make sure you have a heavy-duty night moisturizer.  For night moisturizers, I have used Burt Bee&#x27;s Radiance Night Cream, plain shea butter, and the Nubian Heritage Shea Butter w/ Black Soap Extract and Aloe. The shea butter worked great to maintain balance in my face.</li>
    <li> Effectively helps keep my face clear 99% of the time, and reduces the 1% that get by -- pretty much the best one can ask for. I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I thought by common belief that oil was bad to apply to acne prone skin. The real fact (after much done personal research) is that some oils are beneficial to acne prone skin. Breakouts occur for three major reasons 1. Genetics. 2.Bacteria and 3.Dry skin. Not going into much detail of who what and how causes of acne breakouts but let me tell you THIS soap is perfect for my skin. Tea tree oil is antibacterial, its moisturizing to my dry skin and best of all its organic, no harshness to my sensitive skin! love love love. Really controls my breakouts and complection.</li>
    <li> I am a skin therapist and like to try new products. Unfortunately this one was not one I would recommend. I tried it as a facial cleanser and the first bad thing was it burns terribly if you get it in or near your eyes. Even just washing it off got it into my eyes. Secondly it would leave my skin feeling so tight and dry that I would have to use a heavy duty moisturizer to relieve the tightness. The smell wasnt exactly the most pleasent either but tea tree oil kinda stinks anyway.</li>
    <li> this is just soap- nothing about this soap is specific for face. I like musk but this smell left me trying to give the bottle away to someone else.</li>
    <li> I get a lot of compliments o my skin. I am 67 years old and have almost no wrinkles. I have used this product for years and (other than genitics) I give it complete credit for my smooth, unblemished skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash that doesn&#x27;t give me pimples if I skip using it. I also use it as handwash. Leaves no residue behind.</li>
    <li> I have always loved tea tree oil products. So obviously i like this one especially the price for a bigger bottle like this one..you can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face clean..</li>
    <li> Loved it so much I came back for more.  I have it in the shower and next to my sink.  Its a hand wash, face and body wash that leaves the skin feeling truly clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne problems since my teenage years (now 25) and a couple of years ago my face cleared. However, I still had small bumps that covered my forehead (they weren&#x27;t red or inflamed). After using this facewash for a couple of weeks, these bumps (which I had had for 10 years) went away and they have never come back. When I first started using this facewash my face dried out, but it quickly adapted and now I only need to use it once a day to keep my face clear. I have never loved a fashwash more and I recommend it to everyone I know.</li>
    <li> The antiseptic qualities of this soap will not only help to keep your face clear, but if you use it on your body you will stay fresher longer - if you know what I mean! LOL</li>
    <li> I use Desert Essence products and particularly like this face wash because it leaves my skin clean and feeling fresh. Although I first thought this price was phenomenal, I now realize that I could have bought this 32-ounce refill for about the same price at Whole Foods, which I will do next time instead of buying online.</li>
    <li> THIS CLEANSER WORKS VERY WELL AND REALLY GETS MY FACE AND SHOULDERS/BACK AREA CLEAN. AS OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE NOTED, IT HAS A VERY STRONG SMELL. I HAVE USED IT FOR OVER A MONTH NOW AND HAVENT GOTTEN USED TO THE SMELL. I WOULD SUGGEST PUTTING IT INTO A FOAM PUMP BOTTLE...ITS NOT VERY VISCOUS AND WILL LAST MUCH LONGER IN A FOAM PUMP (I BOUGHT A CHEAP PUMP [$1.50] WITH SOAP IN IT FROM THE PHARMACY AND FILLED IT WITH DESSERT ESSENCE).</li>
    <li> NOTHING CLEANS BETTER!!!!!  LOVE THIS STUFF!!!!</li>
    <li> Great value, but it burns my eyes! I also realized after purchasing that it&#x27;s recommended for oily/combination skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this religiously for over a year and I love it. I always keep some in a travel bottle and don&#x27;t ever use anything else. The ingredients are great and it foams up so nice. I use the Desert Essence moisturizer with jojoba oil with it and I feel like my face is spoiled. I emptied a dollar store foaming hand soap and refilled it with this wash. Way better than all the expensive, ineffective, chemical filled acne treatments the dermatologist prescribes. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product arrives in a bulk bottle.  It works well in a pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about 4 months and am very happy with it.  It has a scent that seemed odd at first, but I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Affordable.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It cleans and rinses thoroughly, is non-drying, and using this every night has greatly improved the feel and appearance of my skin.  I am 40, have VERY sensitive skin, and have been dealing with moderate adult acne breakouts (2-6 pimples lasting 1-2 weeks at a time) for the last couple of years. I was managing it pretty well with Murad acne control cleanser, which was also non-drying and helped a lot.  However, if I didn&#x27;t use that twice a day every day, I would end up with a breakout.  I also found that with the Murad, I had to either use another cleanser first to wash my makeup off, then the Murad, or cleanse with the Murad twice to make sure my face was clean and received the treatment well.  With this Desert Essence wash, I usually only use it at night, and I only need to wash once to get my makeup completely off and leave my skin clean and treated.  Using it once a day does a better job of keeping the acne at bay than using the Murad twice a day, and my skin is smoother and more even than it has been in a couple of years.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Perfect to remove all make up off including eyes.</li>
    <li> Best soap I have ever tried. It is SUPER CHEAP too! It only takes a very small amount to lather up and clean your whole face and neck. I expect, based on use so far, it will last upwards of a year! I shave my head and use it to scrub my entire head, neck and face. It will still last me over a year at this rate. Smells like tea tree and strips oil and grime away without over-drying your skin. Great for men who shave! It will cool the shave down. I use it before and after I shave to prevent bumps. I have used some pricy products, but there is simply no reason if you get this soap! BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser. I first discovered it at Kowalski&#x27;s Market in St. Paul, MN. My favorite feature is how clean and fresh my face feels after washing it, and you don&#x27;t need very much to get that clean, fresh-faced feeling.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years. Simple yet effective for daily cleansing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several years. Nothing else compares. It leaves my skin feeling clean and works great with my oily skin. Fast shipment from this vendor.</li>
    <li> First time using this product and its awesome!! I was a bit hesitant at first but I&#x27;m glad that i tried&lt;br /&gt;it. No irritation occured (sensitive skin) and it also controlled the oils on my face. Yes, the smell is strong as other reviews have mentioned but trust me its worth it.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this product to anyone that wants their skin to feel totally clean.  I work in a harsh environment throughout the summer in a greenhouse.  Great for in between toes too!</li>
    <li> I use this at night to take off my make up and it works great!  Before, when I dry my face on towels after I was my face with other products, the towel would end up with a bunch of make up on it.  Not a problem with this face wash.  It is a little drying, so I only use it at night.  In the morning, I use Cetaphil to keep the skin balance.  Price can&#x27;t be beat!  I filled 1/2 of the foam dispenser with this and dilute with 1/2 water and it still foams up great.  Won&#x27;t need to buy face wash for probably over a year.  The scent is very strong and smells like menthol/herbal medicines, but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Desert Essence Face Wash for 5 years now, and I have just ordered my 2nd (32oz) bottle.&lt;br /&gt;What I appreciate about this product is Awapuhi (a Hawaiian plant) makes a difference in the skin results that are received.&lt;br /&gt;It contains no alcohol, no animal, no perfume, no detergents. (Awapuhi is also an extract of Hawaiian White Ginger).&lt;br /&gt;The reason it burn the eyes is due to it is considered an antiseptic.&lt;br /&gt;I am a Woman of Color, and this product to me is great, never leave any type of residue, film or anything.  Your face feels so fresh, soft and natural.  Great product! ( A+)</li>
    <li> I actually love this product because it doesn&#x27;t have harsh chemical that&#x27;ll rip out the oil out of my skin. But here is why I gave it 4 stars: the smell! Not everyone can get used to the tea tree oil smell. It&#x27;s STRONG! But it goes away the MOMENT I wash it all off. So it&#x27;s  does the job. And If you can stand the tea tree oil smell for like 1 minute, this is a great purchase. Since the liquid is so light and light in viscosity, I do recommend getting a foam soap dispenser or a face scrub to create some foaming action.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with skin problems for most of my life so I was skeptical about yet another acne product.  This one has worked wonders for me though!  It took a very long time for my skin to become completely clear, but I was able to see improvements within two weeks.  I now use it for maintainence.  It is also one of the few acne products that does not dry my combination skin!  This bottle also goes a long way, I purchased this months ago and am only halfway done with the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to get this product in your eyes, as tea tree oil stings, very badly.</li>
    <li> I will have to say the face wash definitely has a tea/earthy scent and very runny. It does lather up real well but recommend a wash cloth to pour the liquid onto. If the product was thicker consistency, it would be more manageable to use. I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all and it doesn&#x27;t linger after using it. It did dry my face a bit but I always use lotion after washing my face. Started to use it with my body wash to see what it does. Remember products like these will vary from individual to individual so take the bad reviews with a grain of salt. Especially the ones about its smell... I give it three stars right now till I use this product more. After that I will give it a final rating.</li>
    <li> I have used SOOOO many face products - as I&#x27;m sure most women have. I love this stuff. My face feels so nice and clean afterwards - refreshed!  all my makeup is washed away - sweat - etc.  Love it. I will never go without it ever again.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for such a quality face wash!  This light cleanser leaves my face feeling fresh every time!  Super sudsy yet rinses quickly.</li>
    <li> My wife and I both use this face wash, and love it. It works very well, leaves your face feeling fresh and clean, and is natural, vegan, and cruelty-free. It does have a bit of an odd smell, which some might find unpleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t linger after you&#x27;ve washed it off.</li>
    <li> This is great!  I&#x27;ve refilled my Tea Tree facial wash twice already and I still have half of this refill left.  Totally worth it!</li>
    <li> Been using this for several years.  Keeps my skin clear and radiant.  I&#x27;ve swayed my husband to use it as well and he is a fan!  I also buy the blemish stick for those nasty sneaky pimples that rear their ugly heads.  With daily use of these cleanser, I barely get those nasty pimples, but if I do, the blemish stick, with a few days of use, (3x/day), does the added trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use it for face and body.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would help clear up my acne.  I followed the directions carefully and kept it in my face for one minute, morning and night.  I&#x27;m still having the same amount, if not more, breakouts.  It&#x27;s a good face wash if you want something all-natural, but not if you&#x27;re prone to acne.</li>
    <li> I love it! Very good for my oilly skin, the best I ever used. Also it is a good price for the receiving quantity.</li>
    <li> This face cleanser leaves my skin really dry. It feels clean, but overall I didn&#x27;t like it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It makes my face dry but not too dry. Its just what I needed. Expecting to see better results soon. Its been a while so that&#x27;s why I rate 4 stars.</li>
    <li> The best facial wash for acne prone or bad skin, I used it for years when my skin acts up but can dry it out if used in a daily basis . Brought for my daughters who are going through puberty</li>
    <li> This is my husband and I&#x27;s absolute favorite face wash. I have very sensitive skin and allergies to certain soaps. This works wonders for my skin. Be warned, it does throughly cleanse, so I&#x27;d suggest buying the desert essence moisturizer or use some sort of moisturizer immediately after. My husband and I love this product and would very highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this soap for 5 years, and I hope it is around forever! I recommend using it in a foaming soap pump, as it has a very watery consistency.  I have found that it helps to reduce waste.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin parched like the popular brands. Great for when my skin gets stressed out from too much time outside, or too much make up. I doesn&#x27;t sting at all, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s for your face, but I definitely use it all over when I&#x27;m feeling lazy, it strips my hair, but I put a lot of product in my hair, so that&#x27;s fine for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for the past 5 years and love it. I wash my face once a day with this soap and it&#x27;s very gentle, especially for my sensitive skin. It helps to heal minor breakouts as well.</li>
    <li> Its difficult to find a product that reduces rosacea and doesn&#x27;t harm your skin or is too harsh.  This product is a wonderful face wash.  It is great at calming my skin and preventing outbreaks of bumps and redness.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for acne etc. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Amazing face wash,. I recommned adding it to a foaming bottle since its very strong and concentrated. Removes oils from your skin extremely well and the fragrance is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this a few weeks and it seems to be doing a good job.  Very nice scent.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT, I can even use it for the whole body, and use it as hair shampoo too, not only just for the face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product alot. Due to the fact that I was completely out and didn&#x27;t have transportation to drive 120 miles to get it, I had to ordered it. I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve found you. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I heard it clean well, and I carefully fill it into a mosse bottle, but first time usage was bit shocked, skin is clean but dry and thirsty. The smell is too strong,it is more like a hand wash to me, no way it is a very good face wash,I did some research then add plenty of water and bit vitamin E oil. Now, everybody is happy. At least other house members are willing to use it.The refill foam bottle is must.!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash ever! It leaves your skin squeaky clean and has been the only soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I have combination skin and have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Excellent face wash! The best I have tried so far. Makes me feel clean and refreshed without over drying. It also helps prevent breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash you can ever have , if your face is little oily then this is it .</li>
    <li> I love this face wash! It removes makeup (even eye makeup) very well, it leaves my skin soft and pores smaller, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry. Just a little moisturizer afterwards and I&#x27;m good to go. It can burn your eyes, but I&#x27;ve found that to be true for any face wash I&#x27;ve used with Glycerin in it- after a few seconds and a splash of water, the sting is gone. Since I&#x27;ve started using this, my skin has been clearer and smoother!</li>
    <li> I am 28 and have breakouts so I had high hopes for this product after reading reviews.  While my breakouts have subsided after using this product, I think it is mainly because my skin is so dried out from this face wash.  However, the face wash has burned my skin so badly that it is just dry, peeling, and red all the time.  My skin looks and feels horrible -- it just looks so irritated.  Maybe my skin is on the more sensitive side but my face felt like it was on fire the first few times from using the face wash.  I was determined to give it a good try so I thought the irritation would subside after my skin adjusted to it.  After 2 months of use, my skin is still just as irritated and dry.  I think the tea tree oil is just too strong.  The (unpleasant) smell of the tea tree oil does not make the experience of washing your face with this face wash any more pleasant.  Combined with the burning sensation and the smell, the act of face washing has become a dreadful event.  Anything this cheap cannot be good for the skin -- not for women anyway.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS!!  My face has never felt so soft!  I was looking for vegan skin care and this was suggested.  Im so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Great stuff with a clean scent. I fill all the soap pumps with it.  Works great for hands, too.  I&#x27;m 65 years old so I don&#x27;t need it for acne.  It&#x27;s just a great cleanser that rinses completely.  Been using it for ten years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for about three years to remove my makeup. It leaves my skin feeling clean and not tight. I have acne-prone skin and am using Retin-A -- I don&#x27;t find that this face wash irritates my skin and it is not overly-drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stings quite a bit if it accidentally gets in your eyes -- and if you accidentally get some in your mouth -- you will be shocked at how terrible it tastes. Not a problem if you don&#x27;t eat your face wash I guess. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This refill bottle is a great value.</li>
    <li> This face wash is great! I purchased the smaller bottle previously and have been using it for several months. This bottle is the refill bottle and is much larger. Should last me quite a while!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve already tapped into this refill bottle; handy to have as I use this product as a daily cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I have a foaming soap pump, and I use this w a scrubby exfoliating cloth as a face and body wash. I love the squeaky clean feeling this soap leaves.</li>
    <li> Always love this face wash!</li>
    <li> I ordered this face wash based off the great reviews and I love it! My face feels so clean after I wash. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin too.</li>
    <li> Love this product. The natural tea tree oil makes my skin feel so good.</li>
    <li> My wife likes what its doing, will update after a couple more weeks</li>
    <li> Most of the facial cleansers I&#x27;ve tried are far too harsh for my sensitive skin--even the &#x27;sensitive skin&#x27; products I tested in the past promoted unnecessary drying and break-outs. After reading some positive reviews about this cleanser on Amazon, I decided to incorporate it into my daily skin-care routine. I&#x27;m glad I did! The wash leaves my face feeling incredibly clean, not stripped or dry, and my skin looks healthy and clear. The smell is a tad earthy (think vegetable garden meets tea tree oil), but I got used to it pretty quickly. To prevent any spillage or waste--the product is a bit runny--I purchased a travel-sized squeeze bottle to fill with the cleanser. I don&#x27;t anticipate having to purchase another bottle of this stuff for another year or so as a little goes a long way, but I will be repurchasing it when I finally do run out.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel so good and healthy.</li>
    <li> This is a face wash based on castile soap (like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s), but is milder than Bronner&#x27;s soap. It has a large hit of tea tree oil, and some other additives that are said to improve the condition of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this stuff on and off for over 15 years as a bodywash and shampoo. My hair is short and I can get away using soap on my hair. People with longer, thicker hair may find soap leaves their hair limp or difficult to style. I appreciate that it cleans and disinfects my armpits so well that I am not so dependent on strong deodorants and antiperspirants as I used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans your skin very well and is especially good at cleaning oily skin. A little goes a long way and easily creates a lather. Recommended to put it in a flip-top bottle and shake a few drops at a time as you wash up in the shower. It rinses off your skin easily, but be aware that castile soap does leave a soap residue on things and you may need to clean your shower and sink more often to keep the scum away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desert Essence products are mostly based on tea tree oil, which is a natural disinfectant. It has a distinct pine-ish, turpentine-ish fragrance that some find off-putting, but dissipates within an hour or so after bathing. A friend of mine credits this product with curing his rosacea. I switch between this product and Desert Essence&#x27;s castile soap, which is a very similar product without the other cosmetic additives contained in the face wash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for my husband and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This face wash makes my face feel thoroughly clean and soft when I use it. I ran out, started using another cleanser, and I started breaking out. My skin just didn&#x27;t feel as good or clean until I went back to using this. I recommend getting a smaller bottle to put it in for daily use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean Face Wash for many years and have always been delighted with it. Having a large refill makes a lot of sense too. I don&#x27;t use this solely for my face, but also on my underarms and feet. I believe the tea tree oil in it kills the bacteria that cause odors. Used daily, this soap totally prevents odor, even without deodorant, and as I have sensitive skin that is a real plus.</li>
    <li> I use this as my main facial cleanser.  It cleans and clears with wonderful but not too overwhelming Tea Tree Oil added.  Great for the body also, especially for skin injuries.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for about 5 years and I would not trade it for the world. I find it to be the most effective way to clear up my skin in combination with natural honey.</li>
    <li> I have used this face soap for years and love it!  It&#x27;s mild, and keeps my complexion clear.  And wonderfully affordable</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase.  I get little weird break outs and this stuff helps prevent them.  If you&#x27;re combination like me you will have to moisturize after washing but you won&#x27;t have to worry about blackheads rearing their ugly... well... heads.  The other reason that this is a great purchase is that you can refill the personal pump a little over four times which makes it a steal.  I paid more for my pump in the store than I did for the refill on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Awesome cleanser that is at a great price!</li>
    <li> Good product, been using this for years! Drys out your face a bit, but just put a really great moisturizer!  Boyfriend loves fancy face wash and now he loves this too! Also, it free of chemical, which is hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have purchased this product from Amazon.  My teenage daughter raves about this face wash.  It is hard to find the refill locally so I ordered it from Amazon.  The product was promptly shipped and packaged properly.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it.  You will be surprised.</li>
    <li> My number one criteria in a new face wash was that it had to be all-natural/organic.  From reading the ingredient list you can rest assured about what you are putting on your face.  But I also needed a face wash to take off a solid layer of foundation every night, and this product does just that!  It removes all my make up and leaves my face feeling squeaky clean.  I do need to use a moisturizer after washing both morning and night, but that is normal for me.  Does it smell good?  No...without any artificial perfumes, you can&#x27;t expect a good smell.  It smells faintly of cheap bathroom cleaner, but it isn&#x27;t that bad.  It is very thin; it&#x27;s about the consistency of baby oil, except it isn&#x27;t oily.  But even though it&#x27;s thin, it lathers up better than any face wash I&#x27;ve ever used!  You can&#x27;t dispense it from the refill bottle it comes in, so I put it in a cosmetic spray bottle.  That way there&#x27;s no mess, plus I use a consistent amount of three squirts every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;all-natural/organic&lt;br /&gt;removes all make up&lt;br /&gt;squeaky clean feeling&lt;br /&gt;great lather&lt;br /&gt;easy use in spray bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;smell&lt;br /&gt;need moisturizer (normal for me)</li>
    <li> Love this face wash glad I was able to buy it with no hassle and promptly</li>
    <li> Cleanser isn&#x27;t bad, but smell is not so great</li>
    <li> For years of eating organic foods and herbs, I decided to look up what the herbal world has for other products I use.  After reading the other reviews I decided just to jump the gun and purchase this large refill bottle as my facewash--NO regrets!  I bought the sponge bob bottle on Amazon for like 3 bucks so I could have a foam dispense and this thing feels and smells great</li>
    <li> Great product and service.  I have been using this for along time and love it</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really use it at all now. Made my face break out like crazy after using it a couple days. I used it the next day thinking my skin just needed to get use to it but I broke out more. I stopped using it cause I could take a chance of breaking out even more. However, I gave it 3 stars because my nephew had also started using it and it worked great for him. He&#x27;s currently going through puberty and breaks out like all teenagers do. This face wash helped clear up his face A LOT just after a week. So I guess it&#x27;s really all dependant upon how your skin reacts to it. I have sensitive skin and it didn&#x27;t work for me. Which was a big let down.</li>
    <li> have used this for about a year. the best thing I have found to fight acne prone skin</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash ever! I just started using it and I love the stuff. It smells fresh and makes my skin feel great. I love the clean look and feel following each use. I have been using this for over a month and have yet to make a dent in the product. I can tell it will last for a long time. YOU MUST USE A FOAM PUMP, so ensure you have one on hand to fully maximize the product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to switch from Cetaphil to a product with less chemicals.  This product has great reviews so I tried it.  It made my skin very very dry-- painfully dry and itchy.  I diluted it to 50% but my chin area (where I break out) is still overly dry.  I have been using mositurizer consistently but still having problems.  I used it for about 1 month but will go back to Cetaphil.  This didn&#x27;t help my acne either.</li>
    <li> disappointed in this product. makes my acne much worse. back to ivory...</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to a friend who swears by it but can no longer get it in his area. Thank you Amazon for being a great resource!</li>
    <li> My face is still getting used to this and it seems to be a little drying, however that is starting to subside. The smell is a bit strong due to the tea tree oil I would guess, however a little goes a long way and the lather it creates seems to clean deeply and leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> Agreed that the smell is that of an institutional floor cleaner. I feel that it cleans well but dries my skin. Will use up this bottle. I won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> I really like the ingredients in this product and the fact that a little goes a long way. What I do is pour some of the face wash into a small hand sprayer and when I get in the shower I \\&quot; mist \\&quot; my body from head to toe and then proceed to wash. It leaves your skin soft, and you know you&#x27;re clean and the tea tree in it is an antibiotic for the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this daily for about 2 years and it&#x27;s fantastic. I have acne-prone, oily t-zone, and very sensitive skin and this has been the best natural cleanser I have found. I feel that it works best when I rub/lather it into my skin for a little bit. It&#x27;s the worst when in gets into your eyes though, so be careful! It also lasts forever! I pour it into smaller bottles and it lasts about a year for my husband and me. Also, I used to get it from Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s now a few dollars less on Amazon.</li>
    <li> To get a through-o review look, check out my blog.  It&#x27;s so amazing and cruelty-free. The tea tree oil is definitely the star of the show.    [...]</li>
    <li> This product is much more watery than I expected. It would be nice if it had more consistency that you are used to from face wash as I find a lot of it going through my fingers when I try to create a lather. This also makes it difficult to wash around your eyes when it runs all over, so it ends up stinging your eyes and creating a little redness. The smell is great though and feels extremely clean.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this. Didn&#x27;t like feel it left on skin, didn&#x27;t like lack of lather, too liquids for easy use. Smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. Love it.</li>
    <li> At first I couldn&#x27;t handle the strong smell.  It reminded me of Pine-Sol floor cleaner.  I almost threw it away.  Then I decided to give it some more time and try a foamer with it.  I just used an old empty bottle from my previous face cleaner. When applied as a foam onto face, the smell is not as bad.  Plus you get used to it.  The cleaner itself is good.  Doesn&#x27;t leave the face dry.  And it does feel clean after it.  Plus it&#x27;s a very good price for an all natural face cleaner.  If the smell was a little bit milder, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Been using it for years.  Outstanding stuff.  Good scent for men too.</li>
    <li> True fan of this face wash, couldn&#x27;t be happier. I think most individuals who purchase this will be happy with the results.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash for an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t mind that it&#x27;s more liquidy then I would like but the smell does get to me. I think it&#x27;s the castille still soap but I&#x27;m not sure. wouldn&#x27;t but again</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years. The only soap that really cleans my skin (oily).</li>
    <li> Love this product. was using other natural products to wash my face..constantly broke out around hair line. After two days w/ desert essence what a difference...1 week clear..It does sting if you get it in your eyes. bought 2nd bottle. will continue to use this product</li>
    <li> best face cleaner I every used</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else that I have tried. Very good for my skin type which tends to be oily but this makes it not so oily and prevents breakouts.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Fast shipping.  Arrived securely packaged and sealed.  Will def. buy again!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Great face wash.  Leaves my face feeling very clean.  use it every day.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out.  Love it</li>
    <li> Wife loves this, can&#x27;t beat the refill price.</li>
    <li> Have been purchasing this product for the last couple years. We used to use a fairly well-known apricot scrub with good results, but after trying this product I switched over and have not looked back. This product is great at eliminating that daily oily-face feeling while not drying out your skin. Great if you love the tingly tea-tree feeling (which I do), just be careful to not accidentally rub into your eyes!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a facial cleanser, it removes make up well and if you have oily, acne skin this is a great product. Last very long and leaves a clean feeling.</li>
    <li> It is very affordable and very effective.  I barely have any pimples now days because of this face wash.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible!  My husband was so skeptical when I told him just how much I liked this product!!!  I usually use Bioelements flash foam cleanser but when I got this and used it like concentrate in a foaming bottle (I did about 1:2 ratio cleanser to water) it blows that stuff out of the water. My skin feels so clean and it&#x27;s helped keep my oil well controlled.  I also love that it is quite gentle and some days I will wash my face three times in one day (due to working out / applying makeup / bed time etc.) and I&#x27;ve never had trouble with peeling or dryness.  Seriously an amazing product at an astronomical value!</li>
    <li> Great stuff and its natural</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash!  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 10 years and the price for this big bottle just can&#x27;t be beat.  My whole family loves it.  Definitely better for oily skin though.</li>
    <li> My Nurse Practitioner Recommended this for acne and it works! It is &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; so its best to buy a small bottle to put it in.  Pour a litte in your palm, lather it up in your hands then apply it to your face, then rinse. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face either! So happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This foams nicely, has a pleasant smell, and feels like it&#x27;s really cleaning your face. My face feels great after I wash it with Desert Essence, but I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell how it works against blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you moisturize because this stuff dries your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy this bottle and put it into a foaming pump-top bottle. This was made to foam and it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
    <li> you have to have a special foaming dispenser to use it, and it doesn&#x27;t really seem to help my face that much.  leaves you smelling like tea tree oil.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 12+ years, its the only thing i use on my face, and this is a steal!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this face wash! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and it has become my all time favorite. It is watery, like other reviewers have stated, but if you put it in a pump dispenser you will find that all it takes is a small amount to generate lots of suds and thoroughly clean your face. A little goes a long way! I love the healthy ingredients with the antibacterial qualities of coconut oil and tea tree, a mix of herbs and not a single toxic additive. Even though this would be a great face wash for those with acne, I am a middle aged woman with fairly dry skin and it works wonderfully without being too drying.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! My skin feels thoroughly cleaned (not tight or congested with oil), and I like the gentle but effective ingredients (no chemicals). I&#x27;m amazed at the quantity received for the price. I will be buying this again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice, clean face wash. Don&#x27;t get near your eyes. It leaves your skin feeling very revived and clean.</li>
    <li> This stuff  is amazing....I have light adult acne and when used every day or other day depending  if face is too dry or not keeps acne  at bay.</li>
    <li> My daughters use this face wash and really like it. Over the years they have tried different products for break-outs. They like this and have been using it for some time.</li>
    <li> Just bought this after doing some review for my daughter, who suffers from teenage acne. We put it into a foam bottle so that it will not be as strong on her face. It seems to be working so far but it is still strong for her skin. She isn&#x27;t having any irritation and that is a big deal because we have tried numerous brands of acne cleansers that have actually dried out and irritated her oily skin. Very excited about this product so far...time will tell if it is going to help her acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having difficulties with breakouts on my face for years. Nothing I used seemed to make that much of a difference - including Proactive. About a month and a half ago, I researched some more natural methods for clearing breakouts and found tea tree oil. I decided to give it a try. It took about 3 weeks but my skin has not only begun clearing up but this face wash has kept new blemishes from appearing. I use it twice a day - in the morning and at night. It does have a very, very strong scent but after about 2 weeks you get used to it. Honestly, though, the strong scent is a small price to pay for clear skin and it goes away once you&#x27;ve rinsed it all off of your face. On top of the this, I also use 100% tea tree oil on my face as a toner after washing my face. I just put some oil on a cotton ball and spread it across my face. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for people to try.</li>
    <li> Works awesome, It does feel like it irritates my skin a little bit but i just add some lotion afterwards and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had an Acne problem and when I made the switch to this product it changed my life! Love this thing! Been using it for over 7 years! It&#x27;s perfect for places like Hawaii.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Besides an effective face wash, the Titree oil is a good anti microbial so I use it for mites in my eye lashes and I use it to clean my sink and toilet as well.</li>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use any other face wash!</li>
