      <li>I found it to be both very gentle and very effective.</li>
      <li>Very, very smooth and satiny.</li>
      <li>But it is very nice for a quick, easy floss</li>
      <li>I think that this dental floss works better than the synthetic type.  </li>
      <li>I feel like it grabs hold of the debris between the teeth - more so than any floss I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>It just does a better job.  </li>
      <li>Both my husband and I love this materal.</li>
      <li>Make sure it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;organic silk floss&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand the toxic petroleum coated, synthetic dental floss that most people use.</li>
      <li>It is silk after all : )  </li>
      <li>I love that it is organic.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this floss.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased his floss many times whenever it has been available and I love the fact it is organic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s biodegradable, organic and it glides nicely between my very cramped teeth!!  </li>
      <li>have since redirected my efforts in increasing sustainability towards reducing packaging - a far more effective approach!</li>
      <li>I used to love the floss &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; because it was so comfortable on my fingers.  </li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s free of harmful chemicals and won&#x27;t harm myself or the environment.  </li>
      <li>but like many eco friendly things, there is a trade off there.  </li>
      <li>I used it all, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of how easily it breaks.</li>
      <li>Tends to break rather, but not too, easily.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t break to easily.</li>
      <li>This breaks way too easily.</li>
      <li>strong and waxy</li>
      <li>Best Floss, hands down.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size and shape to easily get in between tightly spaced teeth without damaging gums.</li>
      <li>Oral hygeine has been a huge problem for</li>
      <li>I wanted to find a dental floss that fit the environmentally friendly/organic description</li>
      <li>I am thrilled because I don&#x27;t have a Whole Foods close</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t Believe Worms Make Such Great Floss.</li>
      <li>Originally, I had decided to try this dental floss since it is made from organic fibers.  </li>
      <li>I was excited that this came in a paper box and is organic...</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a more natural floss after I found out that most floss uses BPA.  </li>
      <li>Originally I tried it on a whim from Whole Foods as I love that it is certified organic.  </li>
      <li>This floss is excellent and considering how hard it is to find organic dental floss</li>
      <li>I think this thick floss is wonderful!  </li>
      <li>The floss actually got stuck on a damaged tooth and took a fair amount of tugging to get it</li>
      <li>Natural, strong, no nasty flavors, biodegradable.</li>
      <li>This floss does break pretty easily.  </li>
      <li>So if anything, that rare shredding and snapping is good encouragement for proper flossing technique.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pleasure to be the first to review this unique item.</li>
      <li>Great floss with no artificial mint flavor but not for tight teeth.  </li>
      <li>Now it may not be as smooth and strong as other petroleum based flosses, but it is still a superior product with a natural origin.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find this product, and it worked fine, but I will not buy it again after what I recently learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk</li>
      <li>I was almost positive that it would because of some of the other reviews I read, but it greatly exceeded my expectations.  </li>
      <li>Your only risk might be that you prefer this to more readily available products.</li>
      <li>Maybe because it is made of natural material, but I find it grips and cleans better than comparable floss of nylon (or whatever they make it out</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very skinny, like a piece of sewing thread, which kind of hurts my fingers.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on the gums but really gets between the teeth clean.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>So I am aware most people won&#x27;t relate to the following statement, but it is the truth:</li>
      <li>The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of junk it pulled out from between my teeth.  </li>
      <li>I have used more recently.  </li>
      <li>so I was pretty iffy about buying it.</li>
      <li>I discovered that if you floss first and then brush your teeth, that doesn&#x27;t happen.</li>
      <li>This floss is significantly more comfortable and does not have overpowering flavorings much less fluoride.  </li>
      <li>Knowing that, I&#x27;m careful in those spots to angle it just right when pulling out, and then it&#x27;s okay,</li>
      <li>This floss is strong and is easy to use, even it stocks a little between the teeth when they are too close.</li>
      <li>Other reviews made me worry that this floss would shred and snap very easily.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as my husband&#x27;s GLIDE, but it is tolerable unlike some other cheap flosses that really hurt to use.  </li>
      <li>If you are health conscious, the floss is worthy of consideration.  </li>
      <li>finally toxic free floss, my whole family use it and everyone loves it!</li>
      <li>No Teflon, Paraffin, or Nylon in this stuff, just pure Silk baby.</li>
      <li>I love that I can throw this floss into the compost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being made from natural material, it does break more than the usual stuff.  </li>
      <li>I feel much safer now using this floss.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very pricey for the amount you get (33 yards...</li>
      <li>This just doesn&#x27;t feel as gentle on gums as the Glide brand I use.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Natural, strong, no nasty flavors, biodegradable. It works.</li>
    <li> Nice and strong...love that it has no flavor and is biodegradable.  I get it on Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a more natural floss after I found out that most floss uses BPA.  This floss doesn&#x27;t shred in between my teeth like other natural brands have, so I appreciate that a lot.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is very skinny, like a piece of sewing thread, which kind of hurts my fingers.  I used to love the floss &amp;#34;tape&amp;#34; because it was so comfortable on my fingers.  Anyway hopefully this one doesn&#x27;t have any BPA!</li>
    <li> i see some people say that it comes apart. I discovered that if you floss first and then brush your teeth, that doesn&#x27;t happen. I like this floss. I have no spaces between my teeth, they are very tight but I can still use it. yes it may be not as strong as the other flosses but I choose healthier option. don&#x27;t want to ingest any unnecessary chemicals</li>
    <li> I like, but very pricey.  And availability is very limited.  Shame on the major manufacturers subjecting us to plastics and Teflon in their floss!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a pleasure to be the first to review this unique item. The first question my dentist asked was whether silk frays as much as conventional dental floss.  The answer is \\&quot;no\\&quot;.  This floss is significantly more comfortable and does not have overpowering flavorings much less fluoride.  If you are health conscious, the floss is worthy of consideration.  The vendor sent the items promptly and packaged the shipment properly.  Your only risk might be that you prefer this to more readily available products.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of junk it pulled out from between my teeth.  My usual floss was much thinner &amp; as a result wasn&#x27;t cleaning my teeth properly - it wasn&#x27;t until using this product that I discovered this fact.  Originally I tried it on a whim from Whole Foods as I love that it is certified organic.  Now that I found it on Amazon I am thrilled because I don&#x27;t have a Whole Foods close by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must stress that yes, the floss is very thick.  I&#x27;ve been told I have very closely spaced teeth or that the spacing is \\&quot;tight\\&quot; despite this I think this thick floss is wonderful!  I feel like it grabs hold of the debris between the teeth - more so than any floss I&#x27;ve used.  It just does a better job.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best Floss, hands down.  Organic silk floss...  I mean come on.  Now it may not be as smooth and strong as other petroleum based flosses, but it is still a superior product with a natural origin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to write a review about floss. I hope it does what for... cleans between my teeth. I like that it&#x27;s organic.</li>
    <li> Other reviews made me worry that this floss would shred and snap very easily. It only seems to start to do this (and just barely) if I try to floss my entire mouth with the same tiny section of floss. So if anything, that rare shredding and snapping is good encouragement for proper flossing technique. My mouth feels cleaner than flossing with nylon though perhaps that&#x27;s just my conscience I&#x27;m feeling. Who knew you could be a hero through oral hygiene?</li>
    <li> I loved that this was organic, but ... Meh... it&#x27;s floss.  It&#x27;s very pricey for the amount you get (33 yards... I buy EcoDent, 100 yards, vegan, for about $5.50, for comparison.  I try to buy organic everything when I can, but without local options for organic floss, just not really worth it to me). This item took over a month to arrive from overseas. I saw lots of people complain about this floss breaking during use.  I did not have that issue at all (and I feel like my teeth are very close together, too).  That said, if organic is vital to you, you are willing to pay the price and await long shipping, then go for it.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again, though.</li>
    <li> Nice floss. No flavor which is my preference.</li>
    <li> I have purchased his floss many times whenever it has been available and I love the fact it is organic. However, I just received two of these and they are clearly marked &amp;#34;Natural Silk Floss&amp;#34; rather than &amp;#34;Organic Silk Floss.&amp;#34; The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; floss also does not contain the USDA Organic seal but instead the words &amp;#34;Natural Floss&amp;#34; inside the little green circle that used to be the seal.</li>
    <li> This floss is excellent and considering how hard it is to find organic dental floss you absolutely cannot beat the price.  It lasts an exceptionaly long time as well and it doesn&#x27;t break to easily.</li>
    <li> Great to have non toxic floss</li>
    <li> The floss works great, some parts of the roll seem to be thicker than others though. Nothing serious just a minor irritation, they should work on standardizing thickness. I haven&#x27;t tried composting it yet so I can&#x27;t attest to its biodegradability.</li>
    <li> Good stuff but nothing real special.  Tends to break rather, but not too, easily.</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t feel as gentle on gums as the Glide brand I use.  It is harder to work between teeth.</li>
    <li> Breaks without even being caught on anything. Almost all floss breaks on 2 of my gaps - this worthless crap broke between teeth that weren&#x27;t even tight. Complete waste of money. Get the brand sold as a generic labeled Hi-Tech. Never breaks, gets wide and really does the job.</li>
    <li> In terms of comfort, I&#x27;d give this floss a 5 out of 10.  It isn&#x27;t nearly as comfortable as my husband&#x27;s GLIDE, but it is tolerable unlike some other cheap flosses that really hurt to use.  It&#x27;s just kind of something that you don&#x27;t notice with this floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to support an eco-friendly attempt to improve on our current floss products, give this one a try!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now and really like that it is compostable and that the packaging can be recycled.  I think that this dental floss works better than the synthetic type.  I like it so much that I&#x27;ve added it to my subscriptions for a regular delivery,</li>
    <li> I love that I can throw this floss into the compost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being made from natural material, it does break more than the usual stuff.  I have pretty tight teeth and there are two spaces where this floss tends to fray and break.  Knowing that, I&#x27;m careful in those spots to angle it just right when pulling out, and then it&#x27;s okay, but like many eco friendly things, there is a trade off there.  Also, I got one package once that was really prone to breaking.  The others have all been fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its performance on the rest of my teeth, I love love love it!  Maybe because it is made of natural material, but I find it grips and cleans better than comparable floss of nylon (or whatever they make it out of).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss is NOT super thick.  It is thin, but not super thin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now.  The same brand makes floss that IS thick, and has a very similar name, so perhaps people (vendors too) are getting confused.  Don&#x27;t buy Radius&#x27; &amp;#34;natural silk floss&amp;#34;.  I did a couple times.  UGH!  That&#x27;s the thick stuff.  Make sure it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;organic silk floss&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s the good stuff.</li>
    <li> I have an allergy to mint and cinnamon, so this silk floss is a nice alternative.  Biodegradable as well, I can add it to the compost pile.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t floss for two years as I reacted to EVERY floss on the market. A friend found this, I tried it very carefully, and I can floss again! My teeth are still recovering from the lack of dental hygiene, but are so happy now!</li>
    <li> Great floss with no artificial mint flavor but not for tight teeth.  I could not use it. It would shred or get stuck in between teeth. Radius has a different soft floss now that works much better for me.</li>
    <li> Best floss out there!</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: My teeth are tightly crowded. All of my dentists have made that clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I&#x27;ve been using this dental floss daily for about three weeks now, and each and every time I have used it, the floss snaps.  The only way I can make it through a full flossing session is to pull out enough floss so that even if it breaks, I can still use the longer side to keep going.  Usually, the floss breaks twice before I finish.  I&#x27;ve tried to adapt and find ways to keep the floss intact, but that usually involves me putting less pressure against my teeth with the floss, which seems to defeat the whole purpose of flossing. As I said before, my teeth are unusually close together, so this might mean the product is not best suited for MY needs, yet could be fine for others.</li>
    <li> Favorite floss! Doesn&#x27;t split or taste nasty</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the toxic petroleum coated, synthetic dental floss that most people use. It makes my gums bleed. My dentist insisted I find something. I tried this. I love it! Perfect size and shape to easily get in between tightly spaced teeth without damaging gums. No petroleum waxes to poison me with either!</li>
    <li> finally toxic free floss, my whole family use it and everyone loves it!</li>
    <li> This floss is strong and is easy to use, even it stocks a little between the teeth when they are too close.</li>
    <li> I was excited that this came in a paper box and is organic... but the container is still plastic. Not an environmental win.</li>
    <li> This is natural and all that, which is nice, because thats kinda hard to come by. But this floss is so thick, aside from if you are missing a tooth, I cant imagine anyone being able to use this floss.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Now, I only floss with SILK. Not much else to say. I can&#x27;t Believe Worms Make Such Great Floss. No Teflon, Paraffin, or Nylon in this stuff, just pure Silk baby.</li>
    <li> This breaks way too easily.</li>
    <li> It does well most of the time, but will shred on the sharp edges of my  teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t usually though.</li>
    <li> It is basically like the dental floss I used years ago - not as gentle as the tape or woven floss I have used more recently.  However, I don&#x27;t have tight teeth, and haven&#x27;t had any problem with breaking or shredding - performs as expected.  I like that it is silk, that seems more environmentally friendly, but it is more expensive, which usually means it requires more resources to get it to the end user.</li>
    <li> i love the origin of the product, organic and fair trade and whatnot. but unfortunately, 4 out of 5 times the floss breaks and i have to string out some more. basically i&#x27;m using double, sometimes triple, of what i should be using. sorry to say but i wont buy again :( unless they make it stronger.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good floss for those with chemical sensitivities. However it often breaks.</li>
    <li> This floss does break pretty easily.  But it is definitely still usable.  I have only had it break a couple of times in the past couple weeks.  I love that it is organic.</li>
    <li> This is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t cause injury to my gums and is non-toxic.</li>
    <li> Picture and description say organic floss. I did not receive organic product.</li>
    <li> This was hard to floss with because it broke so easily. I bought it because I am allergic to mint and find it difficult to buy natural floss without a mint flavor. I used it all, but wouldn&#x27;t buy again because of how easily it breaks.</li>
    <li> It said 55 yd on the description and has since changed to the correct number. Nice fresh feeling after flossing with this and no gross fake flavoring aftertaste.</li>
    <li> This floss works better than any other floss I have used. Being a healthier floss, and an organic one, was a real bonus.</li>
    <li> Originally, I had decided to try this dental floss since it is made from organic fibers.  It did not disappoint!! I found it to be both very gentle and very effective. It fits easily in between my permanent bridge, and it is very kind to my gums. There&#x27;s no nasty, harsh after taste as what I have found with the \\&quot;mint&#x27; flavored variety. I am sensitive artificially flavored anything...including \\&quot;mint\\&quot;. If you tend to be sensitive I highly recommend this brand.  If you are avoiding unnecessary chemicals in general, this is the brand for you. Thanks Amazon! No other vendor seems to offer Radius Organic Biodegradable Silk Floss. Please continue to sell it!</li>
    <li> So thin you could not floss without breaking. Was not good for anything. the thinnest floss I have ever seen</li>
    <li> 5 Stars!!  I absolutely love this floss.  It&#x27;s biodegradable, organic and it glides nicely between my very cramped teeth!!  I wanted to find a dental floss that fit the environmentally friendly/organic description and I&#x27;ve finally found it.  A little goes a long way and it doesn&#x27;t shred while I&#x27;m using it...I was almost positive that it would because of some of the other reviews I read, but it greatly exceeded my expectations.  I love that it&#x27;s free of harmful chemicals and won&#x27;t harm myself or the environment.  Definitely recommended by me!!</li>
    <li> I love this floss! It&#x27;s gentle on the gums but really gets between the teeth clean. You do have to keep it moving along to a new section or it will break but it&#x27;s still the best I&#x27;ve used (and I think I&#x27;ve tried most of them out there!) I also feel good that it&#x27;s biodegradable and not potentially depositing any nasty chemicals into the soft tissues of my mouth when I&#x27;m using it. I will definitely be putting this one on auto-ship! I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> this floss is the best!! kind of expensive so will probably keep looking for something more cost effective. strong and waxy</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I read in one of the other comments that you can only use this floss if you have a tooth missing so I was pretty iffy about buying it. I bought it anyways and its actually a really thin floss and works really well. Best floss I&#x27;ve ever bought. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I never thought that flossing could be a frustrating enough experience to write a review. This is definitely the first and the last time I will be using this floss. It broke on me 8 times during the flossing session. I kept going out of curiosity to see how much a simple action such as flossing could piss me off.</li>
    <li> Very, very smooth and satiny. Glides effortlessly between teeth. It is silk after all : )  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; like the coarse tom&#x27;s flat floss I had been using, so I still keep some of that around for stubborn particles. But it is very nice for a quick, easy floss and if you have very closely spaced teeth it may be the only organic floss that works for you. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This floss was horrible.  I wanted to like it.  It would break.  I had to change the floss up to four times in one flossing because it kept breaking.  We will have to look for some other floss.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I love this materal. It&#x27;s very easy to break but it does a great job on cleaning the teeth if you use with caution. The best part is that it is made in the USA!!!!!</li>
    <li> I feel much safer now using this floss. It is incredibly strong and theres a lot of it! Help say no to bad chemicals and lets all be a little healthier by using natural floss</li>
    <li> Nice stuff, works great!!</li>
    <li> This was a complete disappointment.  The string not only unravels and shreds as soon as I pull it through my teeth,  sometimes it shreds as soon as it is cut from the dispenser.  The texture feels like unspooled thread, sharp and thin.  I bought this because I like to support green products but I also expect quality.  Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have multiple chemical sensitivity and get very sick from chemicals, even organic ones, especially when they end up in my mouth.  Oral hygeine has been a huge problem for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO HAPPY I found this floss!!!  There is no taste, no burn, no nausea, no dizzyness, no intestinal problems, NOTHING!!  It&#x27;s chemically perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some very close teeth and haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakage.  The floss actually got stuck on a damaged tooth and took a fair amount of tugging to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This floss removes so much plaque, that I actually look forward to flossing everyday!  I definitely recommend this floss!</li>
    <li> my favorite dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I really like this brand, and that they make sustainable and biodegradable versions of products that are typically unsustainable. I was very excited to find this product, and it worked fine, but I will not buy it again after what I recently learned:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk (yes, even organic silk) is produced by boiling the silk worms alive. So I am aware most people won&#x27;t relate to the following statement, but it is the truth: If I use this product, conscious animals are subjected to extreme suffering just so that my life can seem the teensiest bit more ecofriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since redirected my efforts in increasing sustainability towards reducing packaging - a far more effective approach! Now I just make due with conventional vinyl floss when I need it... reluctantly.</li>
    <li> On the package it stated 55 yards and I received 33 yards. Not worth the money or effort to return.</li>
