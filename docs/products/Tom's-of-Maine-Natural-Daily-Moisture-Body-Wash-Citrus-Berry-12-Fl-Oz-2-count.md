### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The smell is absolutely delicious.</li>

      <li>This body wash has a very pleasant fruity scent, with a hint of citric.</li>
      <li>is a good brand and this product is very good</li>
      <li>--sounds great to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If that appeals, this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a bright scent to liven up a shower or wake you up, you won&#x27;t find that here.</li>
      <li>Most importantly to me it has a very pleasant smell.</li>

      <li>This is an amazing body wash.</li>
      <li>This body wash has a nice berry and citrus fragrance that stays on my skin for a while after using it</li>

      <li>Nice berry scent that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
      <li>It has nice texture yet washes off easily.</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s uses Safe ingredients.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really love this.</li>
      <li>Now we need a matching lotion :)</li>
      <li>It works and it&#x27;s safe</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what Citrus Berry would smell like.</li>
      <li>I love that the scent is not overbearing, it moisturizes well</li>
      <li>It does not leave a greasy feel on the skin after showering like so many products do.</li>
      <li>The downside is that this really doesn&#x27;t have a great scent:</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s much more berry, with almost no citrus</li>
      <li>so it won’t interfere with your favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>Most companies use the cheapest ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Would give it 5 stars if it lathered better</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than the body wash</li>
      <li>Who doesn’t love the smell of vanilla?  </li>
      <li>It works good but the fragrance  is too much for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Found this product to be very mild.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural product, that lathers well and leaves no residue, this is good.  </li>
      <li>I like it but keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t a particularly strong cleanser</li>
      <li>The gloves were fine until we used them in conjunction with this body wash.</li>
      <li>It has a smooth consistency that is easy to work into a rich lather.</li>
      <li>but, it washes away to a light, fruit scent.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this Tom&#x27;s of Maine body wash does not seem to cause any skin problem on her.</li>
      <li>This would be good for someone who is sensitive to smells.</li>
      <li>It smells pretty much like the description states and its fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering at all, being quite pleasant.</li>
      <li>It had a mild citrus/berry smell, which is good as it was marked as \\&quot;citrus berry\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>and it leaves you feeling clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit oily, and unisex/earthy rather than sweet/cloying, but it suds up well and washes away clean.</li>
      <li>It rinses clean without over drying.</li>
      <li>It leaves you feeling clean yet doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you have a filmy cover still on your skin after you rinse it off.</li>
      <li>I like the fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The scent fades quickly after you get out of the shower</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used various Tom&#x27;s products over the years and they just get better and better.</li>
      <li>May have found a new favorite.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather quite a well as most liquid soap, but it does feel nice against your skin and leaves it feeling a little softer.</li>
      <li>The ingredients read don&#x27;t read like a science experiment, and the color, consistency and fragrance are so much more natural.</li>
      <li>Unlike most shower gels which can often strip your skin of moisture, the creamy texture of this body wash, with its sunflower oil, olive oil, and vitamin E, made my skin feel super-smooth and soft after just one usage.</li>
      <li>So far it feels refreshing and</li>
      <li>wife has the most sensitive nose of anyone I know, and hates chemicals.  </li>
      <li>body wash does NOT have phthalates, parabens, or phenoxyethanol; NO artificial colors, flavors, fragrances, or preservatives.</li>
      <li>Sure enough, the product in use has no scent of citrus or berries, but comes through as mild vanilla and earthy lawn herbs--I suppose the sunflower.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and my skin was absolutely fine after using this product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And of course, this product uses more natural ingredients, never animal tested, is a plus, certainly for anyone who might have some hypoallergenic symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the citrus - berry  very much.  </li>
      <li>I can’t help wishing the large bottle had a pump on top rather than a squeeze and pour distribution because a lot comes out if you’re not careful.</li>
      <li>But not that we&#x27;re headed into winter and running the heat more, I definitely need lotion in addition to this.</li>
      <li>My first impression was that there was a lot of fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This body wash doesn&#x27;t seem to be more moisturizing than any regular body wash I&#x27;ve used</li>
      <li>This is my first Tom&#x27;s of Maine product</li>
      <li>Okay, my initial review?</li>
      <li>but it does clean well and makes a nice amount of later when used with or without one of those net type bath sponges.</li>
      <li>It felt heavenly on my lower legs where I do experience more dry skin.  </li>
      <li>As someone with more oily skin than dry</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s is certainly a reliable company, and I appreciate the lack of odd-sounding chemicals.</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s of Maine Daily Moisture Body Wash, Citrus Berry is a fine product that performs as promised.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I really dig this stuff, and wished I&#x27;d jumped on the Tom&#x27;s bandwagon sooner.</li>
      <li>She found the aroma fresh and natural and gave it a thumbs</li>
      <li>A noseful of real orange peel, and real berry.</li>
      <li>and it seems to be gentle on the skin, but</li>
      <li>While some of my cosmetics and cleaning products still have these types of chemicals in them, I am trending toward using as many all natural products as possible.</li>
      <li>After having used various kinds of shower gels and body washes, this has the freshest, most natural scent I have come across.</li>
      <li>This brand is growing in popularity due to increased marketing and consumers&#x27; desires for more products that are paraben and phthalate-free.  </li>
      <li>Gentle and safe ingredients; my sensitive dry skin didn&#x27;t freak out after using.  </li>
      <li>I love that Tom&#x27;s of Maine offers all natural products and this product is no different.</li>
      <li>Smell wasn&#x27;t really my favorite even though I typically like citrus-scented washes/shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The skin on my arms and legs that was dry and flaky is now supple and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I know Iove it and that’s the main scent in this body wash</li>
      <li>, you need to use a little more which means it will run out quicker.</li>
      <li>I would like a little more scent.</li>
      <li>as I try to be more conscious of what I use on my skin (which absorbs the chemicals in our products) is that there are no Phthalates, Parabens, or Phenoxyethanol - questionable chemicals found in many bath products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of the few body wash products she can safely use.</li>
      <li>It also does a good job of cleaning without irritating the skin, and rinsing off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This lathers nicely, and two dollops the size of a half dollar are enough to shower completely.</li>
      <li>I have really sensitive skin, and this body wash is such a breath of fresh air.</li>
      <li>Although It lathered nice, it left my skin feeling dry - which I think is the opposite of what a moisturizing body was is supposed to do.  </li>
      <li>I cannot recommend this product at all, and it pains me that I wrote a positive review on it initially.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Ingredients: water, decyl glucoside, glycerin, sunflower seed oil, sodium chloride, xanthan gum, natural fragrance, olive fruit oil, citric acid, lactic acid, vitamin E acetate.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Tom&#x27;s is all natural with olive oil and vitamin E.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather much and almost seems like you&#x27;re using a lotion instead of a proper body wash when applied.</li>
      <li>The upside is that is uses natural fragrances and oils.</li>
      <li>My daughter has sensitive skin that would trigger eczema with some body wash and shampoo products.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin feels smoother and less dry after using this and there&#x27;s none of that greasy, slide out of the shower feeling that is often present in moisturizing body washes. Tom&#x27;s is certainly a reliable company, and I appreciate the lack of odd-sounding chemicals. I was a bit puzzled by the fragrance, which seemed more peach baby food than citrus or berries, but the aroma did not last past the shower, so isn&#x27;t a drawback.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash. It looks white-ish and gel-like, and it lathered up and cleaned like I&#x27;d expect from a body wash. It had a mild citrus/berry smell, which is good as it was marked as \\&quot;citrus berry\\&quot;. The body wash left my skin looking and feeling not-dried-out but didn&#x27;t leave a noticeable \\&quot;moisturizing\\&quot; residue on my skin. I didn&#x27;t need to use lotion after my shower like I usually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash does NOT have phthalates, parabens, or phenoxyethanol; NO artificial colors, flavors, fragrances, or preservatives. I like that their ingredient list is minimal and explained what the different ingredients are. I couldn&#x27;t find this specific product on the Skin Deep database yet, but Tom&#x27;s of Maine products are generally getting \\&quot;safe\\&quot; scores there and the individual ingredients all appear to be low danger/safe. It works and it&#x27;s safe--sounds great to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: water, decyl glucoside, glycerin, sunflower seed oil, sodium chloride, xanthan gum, natural fragrance, olive fruit oil, citric acid, lactic acid, vitamin E acetate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I guess I&#x27;d call this a \\&quot;summmer weight\\&quot; moisturizer. It&#x27;s better than the body wash I&#x27;d been using, which didn&#x27;t claim to be a moisturizer. But not that we&#x27;re headed into winter and running the heat more, I definitely need lotion in addition to this. I still like it, though.</li>
    <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t really my favorite even though I typically like citrus-scented washes/shampoo.  Although It lathered nice, it left my skin feeling dry - which I think is the opposite of what a moisturizing body was is supposed to do.  Because it felt like it dried out my skin, I clearly would not use it on a daily basis.  Thus it&#x27;s essentially &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> I like this product. It has more of a sweet berry fragrance than citrus, but it still smells great. It doesn&#x27;t lather quite a well as most liquid soap, but it does feel nice against your skin and leaves it feeling a little softer. I like that the fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering. Would give it 5 stars if it lathered better, you need to use a little more which means it will run out quicker.</li>
    <li> After having used various kinds of shower gels and body washes, this has the freshest, most natural scent I have come across. The citrus and berry scents combine to create a peachy fragrance. Unlike most shower gels which can often strip your skin of moisture, the creamy texture of this body wash, with its sunflower oil, olive oil, and vitamin E, made my skin feel super-smooth and soft after just one usage. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to use lotion to conbat fall-weather dry, itchy skin as I normally would.  I&#x27;ve used various Tom&#x27;s products over the years and they just get better and better.</li>
    <li> This is my first Tom&#x27;s of Maine product and I&#x27;ll admit to being a bit unimpressed.  This brand is growing in popularity due to increased marketing and consumers&#x27; desires for more products that are paraben and phthalate-free.  This body wash has a short ingredient list which is provided in this product description.  The upside is that is uses natural fragrances and oils. The downside is that this really doesn&#x27;t have a great scent: it&#x27;s much more berry, with almost no citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed any moisturizing qualities and have even noticed my skin has been itchy this week.  However, I&#x27;ll need to discontinue using this to see if it was the body wash or the recent change in weather that caused these problems. (I&#x27;m not convinced it was this wash.)  If you&#x27;re looking for a more natural product, that lathers well and leaves no residue, this is good.  If you&#x27;re looking for a bright scent to liven up a shower or wake you up, you won&#x27;t find that here.</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin, and this body wash is such a breath of fresh air. The ingredients read don&#x27;t read like a science experiment, and the color, consistency and fragrance are so much more natural. With &#x27;citrus berry&#x27; in the name, I&#x27;d expected a really obnoxious tutti fruity odor, but instead I got...citrus berry. A noseful of real orange peel, and real berry. Imagine inhaling the leafy hull of a strawberry...that&#x27;s the closest approximation I can make. It&#x27;s a bit oily, and unisex/earthy rather than sweet/cloying, but it suds up well and washes away clean. I really dig this stuff, and wished I&#x27;d jumped on the Tom&#x27;s bandwagon sooner.</li>
    <li> I love that Tom&#x27;s of Maine offers all natural products and this product is no different. I have very sensitive skin and my skin was absolutely fine after using this product. I love that the scent is not overbearing, it moisturizes well and it leaves you feeling clean.</li>
    <li> My first impression was that there was a lot of fragrance.  I think this product is too fruity for a man.  It works good but the fragrance  is too much for me.</li>
    <li> (EDIT 11/19/14: Okay, my initial review? Ignore it. This stuff absolutely sucks. Why? Well, let me tell you. After using this a couple of times, I came to notice a strange odor in my bathroom. Turns out that this stuff starts to stink when it settles. My wife and I used this with bath scrubbing mitts (basically a sponge/washcloth that you wear on your hands if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m referring to) and after a day, they started to stink like cat litter. That&#x27;s the closest thing I can even equate it to. The gloves were fine until we used them in conjunction with this body wash. I also noticed after the second or third day of use that I could smell that weird cat litter smell coming off of me, which was verified when we realized that the wash was the common element in every instance where we came across that odor. I cannot recommend this product at all, and it pains me that I wrote a positive review on it initially. My apologies.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;Found this product to be very mild. It smells pretty much like the description states and its fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering at all, being quite pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t lather much and almost seems like you&#x27;re using a lotion instead of a proper body wash when applied. I like it but keep in mind that this isn&#x27;t a particularly strong cleanser, it will, however, leave you smelling nice.</li>
    <li> This body wash is divine! Gentle and safe ingredients; my sensitive dry skin didn&#x27;t freak out after using.  In fact, this is one of the few moisturizing body washes to actually leave my skin feeling moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the scent?  Swoon!  Yum!  Like I said, divine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This body wash has a very pleasant fruity scent, with a hint of citric. It has a smooth consistency that is easy to work into a rich lather. It is a refreshing wash since the scent is rather natural instead of artificially forced. It also does a good job of cleaning without irritating the skin, and rinsing off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate this product is made of natural ingredients and does not contain artificial phthalates (plasticizers), parabens (fragrance/preservative) and phenoxyethanol (preservative) that are widely used in the cosmetic and skin care industries. Some people are allergic to some of these artificial ingredients. My daughter has sensitive skin that would trigger eczema with some body wash and shampoo products. Fortunately, this Tom&#x27;s of Maine body wash does not seem to cause any skin problem on her. It&#x27;s one of the few body wash products she can safely use.</li>
    <li> A lot of people forget that your skin is an organ too, and absorbs a lot of the chemicals that are thoughtlessly put into soaps and other cleaning products.  And lets not even get started on what happens to those chemicals when they go down the drain and into the environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has the most sensitive nose of anyone I know, and hates chemicals.  She found the aroma fresh and natural and gave it a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition it was very effective as a body wash, leaving skin feeling clean and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toms is a good brand and this product is very good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try a Tom&#x27;s product for years. I must say I am somewhat disappointed. There is almost no fragrance at all, much less something citrusy. Lots of lather and it seems to be gentle on the skin, but I would like a little more scent. This would be good for someone who is sensitive to smells.</li>
    <li> We like this product. It has nice texture yet washes off easily. It leaves you feeling clean yet doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling like you have a filmy cover still on your skin after you rinse it off. Most importantly to me it has a very pleasant smell. We like all of Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s products and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> Really love this. Nice berry scent that&#x27;s not too strong. Tom&#x27;s is all natural with olive oil and vitamin E. I&#x27;m hoping it will help combat my dry skin issues during the cold winter months. So far it feels refreshing and my skin feels moisturized. May have found a new favorite.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing body wash. It doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty film behind. It lathers nicely, even though it lacks the nasty chemical found in most body washes. It rinses clean without over drying. It has lots of good stuff to keep your skin moisturized and healthy. The smell is absolutely delicious. I wasn&#x27;t sure what Citrus Berry would smell like. It kind of reminds me of a tangerine. It doesn&#x27;t smell artificial like other citrus scented washes I have tried. I&#x27;m hooked. Now we need a matching lotion :)</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Daily Moisture Body Wash I rate it 4/5 stars. This body wash has a great light citrus scent, lathers up nicely and moisturizes the skin.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is known as a company that cares about people and the environment. Tom&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t use artificial color, fragrance or preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Berry Body Wash has sunflower oil, olives oil and vitamin E so it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  The skin on my arms and legs that was dry and flaky is now supple and smooth.  I like the citrus - berry  very much.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but the scent lasts awhile.  My bathroom smells heavenly : + )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day Dr Oz was talking about the dangers of Phthalates.  They&#x27;re in a lot of the products we use and eat.  They really mess up your body!  Tom&#x27;s has NO PHTHALATES - Parabens or  Phenoxyethanol.  Most companies use the cheapest ingredients.  Tom&#x27;s uses Safe ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care about your health - use Tom&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Whether or not you will like this product depends on what you are looking for. If bubble bath foaminess or noticeable fragrances that linger both in and out of the shower is your preference, forget it. You won&#x27;t get that here. If fewer chemical ingredients in a simple bath wash is closer to your goal, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is creamy to the touch but has very little fragrance at all. There is no way I could identify citrus or berry. It does produce some suds but they are neither copious not long lasting. I am used to low sudsing shampoos, so this does not bother me. It does cleans the skin well even after the suds are gone, and I have not experienced any cracking or scaling of my skin. It does not leave a greasy feel on the skin after showering like so many products do. It does not exfoliate. The product information does mention the need to use a moisturizer after showering, but I didn&#x27;t. I like the fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big plus as I try to be more conscious of what I use on my skin (which absorbs the chemicals in our products) is that there are no Phthalates, Parabens, or Phenoxyethanol - questionable chemicals found in many bath products. If that is important to you, then you should at least give this product a try.</li>
    <li> This lathers nicely, and two dollops the size of a half dollar are enough to shower completely. The scent says &#x27;Citrus Berry&#x27;.  The description mentions vanilla, and sunflower, and variations thereof--no citrus element nor berry.  Sure enough, the product in use has no scent of citrus or berries, but comes through as mild vanilla and earthy lawn herbs--I suppose the sunflower. If that appeals, this is a great product.  If the lawn herbs bring to mind &#x27;weeds&#x27;, another scent might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave skin soft and moist.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Daily Moisture Body Wash in Citrus Berry is a decent body wash. That&#x27;s it. It&#x27;s not amazing but, it&#x27;s not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is labeled as having a citrus berry scent. It doesn&#x27;t smell like citrus or berries. It has a generic &amp;#34;fruit&amp;#34; smell. It is actually very strong and chemical smelling when it comes out of the bottle but, it washes away to a light, fruit scent. I&#x27;m not sure why it smells so chemical like when the bottle says that it only uses natural fragrances but, it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat dry skin and, while this product didn&#x27;t really add moisture to it, it also didn&#x27;t take any moisture away from it. So, it was an even trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would use this product again. It seems like a dependable, everyday type of body wash.</li>
    <li> Who doesn’t love the smell of vanilla?  I know Iove it and that’s the main scent in this body wash but I also smell a citrus under note.  The scent fades quickly after you get out of the shower so it won’t interfere with your favorite cologne.  The liquid itself feels silky on your skin and is thicker than you’d expect.  As someone with more oily skin than dry I’ve always hesitated to use moisturizing soaps because they can be difficult to rinse off and though Tom’s is moisturizing it was only slightly more work intensive to shed than regular soap.  It felt heavenly on my lower legs where I do experience more dry skin.  I can’t help wishing the large bottle had a pump on top rather than a squeeze and pour distribution because a lot comes out if you’re not careful.</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine Daily Moisture Body Wash, Citrus Berry is a fine product that performs as promised. The fragrance is not overwhelming and the soaping action is certainly sufficient. I was afraid that the odor would be too strong and the soaping action would not work as well as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, this product uses more natural ingredients, never animal tested, is a plus, certainly for anyone who might have some hypoallergenic symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well recommend product.</li>
    <li> This body wash doesn&#x27;t seem to be more moisturizing than any regular body wash I&#x27;ve used but it does clean well and makes a nice amount of later when used with or without one of those net type bath sponges. But the thing I like best about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have any phthalates, parabens or phenoxyethanol in it. While some of my cosmetics and cleaning products still have these types of chemicals in them, I am trending toward using as many all natural products as possible. I also buy only products that aren&#x27;t tested on animals and this one isn&#x27;t. This body wash has a nice berry and citrus fragrance that stays on my skin for a while after using it but it&#x27;s not so intense that it interferes with other fragrance products.</li>
