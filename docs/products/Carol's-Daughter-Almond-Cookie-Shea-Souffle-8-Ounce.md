    <li> This is one of my all time faves!!! Made the mistake of not purchasing the larger jar:( I most defintely will next time. If you are considering purchasing, go for it! very hot item even Carol&#x27;s Daughter didn&#x27;t have any in stock, which lead me here:) Hope this helps , Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is the best creamy lotion I have ever had!</li>

    <li> Love this product, it feels and smells sooo good!</li>

    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter is a very good product that I will always use.  The soufflé has a clean fresh feeling and smell.  I am hoping Carol&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s products will always be available.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful  Got some for family</li>
    <li> If you have extremely dry skin, this is exactly what you need.  This stuff is heaven sent.. no ashy for me anymore. Moisturizing with the greasy residue.  This is great and a clean almond scent.</li>
    <li> This is one of those purchases that I continue to buy over and over.  I love it and it arrives on time.</li>
    <li> This stuff is creamy and luscious. It smells so good you almost want to eat it - lol. I received my first jar as a gift and now cannot be without it, so I hope they never change the formula. It absorbs into the skin well and I just feel good using it. When I went on vacation recently I didn&#x27;t take my face cream, I just used the Almond Cookie Souffle for everything. And every time I wear it my spouse says &amp;#34;Mmm, you smell good.&amp;#34;  I like that!</li>
    <li> Favorite product.  The best smelling lotion out there. It is great for dry skin. Love the way it feels and it keeps my skin soft and smooth.  So creamy and rich feeling on my skin.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes and smells GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> I have never used anything like this before.  When you put in on and rub it into your hands, feet, arms, etc.  it penetrates the skin and refreshes the dry areas.  It stays with me all day long.  I just love it</li>
    <li> My skin drinks this up. This smells fantastic and is very rich and creamy. Perfect to quell dry skin-Brisce M</li>

    <li> I order this all the way from America. I live in Amsterdam Holland. And i love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and is a good moisturizer.  I was using a newer product from Carol&#x27;s daughter and tried to order it, but it was out of stock, so I ordered the almond soufflé as an alternative. The soufflé isn&#x27;t as good a moisturizer as the other product but it gets the job done. If you just need a light body moisturizer, this product is great.</li>
    <li> Great for my skin and has a nice almond scent.  Made like a body butter, but absorbs like a lotion on the skin.</li>
    <li> It smells great, Very soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> I used this for several years, and it helps my dry skin.</li>
    <li> So creamy and the scent is wonderful!</li>
    <li> Iove it light weight smell good but not what looking for strong almond cookie smell but I like it.</li>
