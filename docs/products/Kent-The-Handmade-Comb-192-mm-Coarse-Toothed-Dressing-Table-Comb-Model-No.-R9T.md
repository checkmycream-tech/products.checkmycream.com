      <li>100% better</li>
      <li>Definitely my favorite go-to comb, all around.</li>
      <li>I am pleased.</li>
      <li>After the first use you&#x27;ll know how much better this Kent comb is compared to anything you could pick up at Target, Wal-Mart or etc.</li>
      <li>Teeth are thicker than I expected but comb works fine and feels great in your hand.</li>
      <li>Tha very fact that it&#x27;s handmade tells you the quality&#x27;s better.</li>
      <li>I have loved the comb, and it truly is far superior to other brands.</li>
      <li>Love my new comb.</li>
      <li>Very well made and easy on the eye.</li>
      <li>Worth the price, and should &amp;#34;last forever.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t fully polished and smooth like the older comb.  </li>
      <li>I own several Kent combs and this one is just as nice as the other.</li>
      <li>I liked my first one so much that I ordered a second one.</li>
      <li>So keep your hair straight, and look good for other space ships you might pass by on the way.  </li>
      <li>This product received is exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>Great comb for thick hair.</li>
      <li>Nice feel in hand, glides thru hair without pulling or ripping, good price, should last a long long time.</li>
      <li>Good value on Amazon as usual.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These combs are just like my favorite set of sunglasses - they&#x27;re high quality and built to last.  </li>
      <li>The real problem is with the finish.  </li>
      <li>Tames wet hair better even that my Kent brushes without flattening my hair.  </li>
      <li>Not too much tearing of the hair when detangling snarls.  </li>
      <li>I did not think that it could be better than other combs.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the kind of comb that looks as though it will last a very long time.</li>
      <li>You can find more expensive ones, I&#x27;m sure - but why would you bother?  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Finally, a comb that is for real!!</li>
      <li>Real old school comb as they should be made still</li>
      <li>As soon as I took it out of the packaging, I noticed that the plastic looked very cheap and was a different color than the previous model.  </li>
      <li>I know I should not expect the same exact level of quality as my old comb, but this is inexcusable.  </li>
      <li>No seams, no burrs, no harsh edges...</li>
      <li>The sad part is that I would be willing to spend more money to get a similar level of quality to that of the old comb.  </li>
      <li>The new product is garbage, and I can&#x27;t believe that Kent and Amazon would sell such a piece of junk.  </li>
      <li>Kent has fallen very, very far in the last 10 years.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ve been using a normal flat comb.</li>
      <li>These combs get some silly reviews, but I have to say, they&#x27;re amazing.  </li>
      <li>This new comb is a HUGE disappointment and doesn&#x27;t even come close to the quality of the older one!  </li>
      <li>they remind me of quality sunglasses, like how Ray Ban does the same thing - they&#x27;re molded, but there&#x27;s an attention to detail that you don&#x27;t find in the cheaply made, stamp-n-go styles commonly found in department stores.  </li>
      <li>I thought it was a fluke, so I opened the other new comb and tried it.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Definitely my favorite go-to comb, all around. Head and beard. Must have for anybody. Highly recommended. No hassle, great product.</li>
    <li> Teeth are thicker than I expected but comb works fine and feels great in your hand.</li>
    <li> I purchased this (and another model) to have a back-up to a Kent comb that I have had for about 10 years.  I have loved the comb, and it truly is far superior to other brands. This new comb is a HUGE disappointment and doesn&#x27;t even come close to the quality of the older one!  As soon as I took it out of the packaging, I noticed that the plastic looked very cheap and was a different color than the previous model.  This wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me, so I used the comb.  The real problem is with the finish.  It isn&#x27;t fully polished and smooth like the older comb.  There are some burrs on the teeth and there are notches where it wasn&#x27;t cut correctly.  The notches pull and damage the cuticle of your hair as you use it. I thought it was a fluke, so I opened the other new comb and tried it.  It has the same poor finish with the notches in some of the teeth.  I have long hair, so this just won&#x27;t work.  I wish I would have decided to return this (and the other model) before using it.  Kent has fallen very, very far in the last 10 years.  I know I should not expect the same exact level of quality as my old comb, but this is inexcusable.  The new product is garbage, and I can&#x27;t believe that Kent and Amazon would sell such a piece of junk.  The sad part is that I would be willing to spend more money to get a similar level of quality to that of the old comb.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I own several Kent combs and this one is just as nice as the other.</li>
    <li> This comb really is very nice. Tha very fact that it&#x27;s handmade tells you the quality&#x27;s better. I have thick, over the shoulder length hair and it practically glides through it.I won&#x27;t have to purchase this again for quite some time unless I lose it, because it is sturdy without ripping through one&#x27;s hair.  It was a great purchase, and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, S. Brooks 4/30/12</li>
    <li> Another quality product of Kent never need to buy another.</li>
    <li> As a nervous habit I comb my hair while sitting at my desk. my hair has gotten too long and thick for my curry comb so I&#x27;ve been using a normal flat comb. I upgraded to the Kent. It works great. After the first use you&#x27;ll know how much better this Kent comb is compared to anything you could pick up at Target, Wal-Mart or etc.</li>
    <li> Great comb for thick hair.</li>
    <li> People, we traverse time and space with these fleshy space ships called bodies.  Without it we would not experience life as we know it.  So keep your hair straight, and look good for other space ships you might pass by on the way.  Kent, it&#x27;s what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
    <li> This comb is very solid and extremely well made. I liked my first one so much that I ordered a second one. It&#x27;s the kind of comb that looks as though it will last a very long time.</li>

    <li> Finally, a comb that is for real!! It actually does what it is supposed to do, and the teeth actually work!! This is the slighly longer version,at 192 mm, which is great for home use. I wish all combs were like this one!!</li>
    <li> These combs get some silly reviews, but I have to say, they&#x27;re amazing.  The level of attention to detail on them is amazing.  No seams, no burrs, no harsh edges...they remind me of quality sunglasses, like how Ray Ban does the same thing - they&#x27;re molded, but there&#x27;s an attention to detail that you don&#x27;t find in the cheaply made, stamp-n-go styles commonly found in department stores.

You can find more expensive ones, I&#x27;m sure - but why would you bother?  These are perfect.</li>
    <li> Great comb. Thick and sturdy. 100% better the crap black ones you&#x27;d buy at the shops.</li>
    <li> I bought this style to compliment my purchase of a larger dressing comb.  They are both wonderfully made and comfortable to use.  Not too much tearing of the hair when detangling snarls.  Worth the price, and should &amp;#34;last forever.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Excellent, polite customer service and very speedy processing. This product received is exactly as pictured. I am pleased. Will order again from these nice people.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly supprised. I did not think that it could be better than other combs. I was supprised to find that it does. Love my new comb.</li>
    <li> Nice feel in hand, glides thru hair without pulling or ripping, good price, should last a long long time. my wife was happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> These Kent combs are the BEST!  Great quality, weight, finish.</li>
    <li> This comb compares well to its Swiss competitor brands. Very well made and easy on the eye. Nice feel on hands and hair. Good value on Amazon as usual.</li>
