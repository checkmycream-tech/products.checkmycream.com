      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>wonderful attachment.</li>
      <li>Awesome company!</li>
      <li>does an excellent job as advertised.</li>
      <li>works wonderful.</li>
      <li>and it works perfectly!</li>
      <li>And the clippers by the way, also awesome.</li>
      <li>One of the best purchases I ever made - works great for me.  </li>
      <li>and it worked great..</li>
      <li>I did this around my ears and it worked great.</li>
      <li>it works great.</li>
      <li>and his haircuts never looked that great.</li>
      <li>Great to do business with.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
      <li>good instructions and intuitive &amp;</li>
      <li>works great , helps make my hair cuts nice and no cleanup after.</li>
      <li>Even though it did not specifically list the WA8451, the non-senior cover fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>I own a 5 gal.</li>
      <li>the package arrived in a timely manner, which was nice.</li>
      <li>The kit was very easy to assemble,</li>
      <li>It was very easy to install and works well.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, just need to have the right razor.</li>
      <li>so make sure you have a Wahl clipper that will work with this kit.  </li>
      <li>My wiggly, itchy grandsons, and great nephews are very grateful.</li>
      <li>It kind of seems that this will fit all razors but not so.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to check your clippers to make sure the screw placements match the placements on the conversion piece.</li>
      <li>They love having their hair cut now that the hair doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes, nose and mouth.  </li>
      <li>But this clipper with the vac attachment made it so easy.</li>
      <li>Easy ti install, and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I do recommend, it&#x27;s light, easy to handle and easy to assembly.  </li>
      <li>Neither of the covers that came with the kit fit my Wahl clipper.  </li>
      <li>The best purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried hooking it up to my Kirby, but that has an angled tube, so I had to get out my small canister vac.</li>
      <li>It went much better, though he still doesn&#x27;t hold very still</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s how quick it went.</li>
      <li>But, with my C-pap hose mod, this item is fantastic.</li>
      <li>so maybe I made it harder than it needed to be, but it really works great now.  </li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t make the same mistake and make sure it will fit your clipper first before ordering.</li>
      <li>You need one with the right screw pattern (4 screws on the back).&lt;br</li>
      <li>This and the Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper Model 8451 really does the trick.</li>
      <li>The airflow with this particular vacuum is so great that I must momentarily pull the hose seat off of the end of my Ridgid gulper hose in order to oil my blades or the oil will particulate directly into the air stream.</li>
      <li>Now they fight to go first.  </li>
      <li>But otherwise this setup works very well!</li>
      <li>Just be aware that it will most likely not work with Wahl products you purchase from large retailers.</li>
      <li>I get a very clean next cut.</li>
      <li>It works for my balding 5star wahl clippers.the reason only 4 star rating is the hose.for what you pay the hose should be stronger.it kinks up to easy..</li>
      <li>Thankyou so much.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>and it really saves me time and money  </li>
      <li>real problem</li>
      <li>Kids really appreciate this.</li>
      <li>The attachment basically replaces the back cover on the original unit.</li>
      <li>The hose pinches when the vacuum is on and the hair can&#x27;t be sucked through, thus defeating the purpose of eliminating the need to clean up hair.  </li>
      <li>Seems like it would be simple enough to include a couple more adapters, particularly since this is not an inexpensive kit.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>Assembly was very easy as long as you have a #1 philips screwdriver to remove and replace the 3 screws (the more common #2 philips screwdriver is just too big.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;the clipper attachment has cracked, which is the reason for ordering the new one.  </li>
      <li>Once I turned the unit on, the top cover of the vacuum chamber caused a noise due to the vibration, but the noise stop once I held the clipper during normal use.</li>
      <li>so I had to return it but be aware that not only do the customer pay to return</li>
      <li>I was a barber for 40 years, and the first shop I worked at used Wahl vacuum clippers.</li>
      <li>I use a C- pap machine when I sleep, so I have an endless supply of really quality hoses that fit the Wahl Vacuum Clipper attachment like a glove.</li>
      <li>I think this &amp;#34;cord spiral&amp;#34; may be a partial antidote for those who found the tube to kink too easily (it can, but it doesn&#x27;t where the cord is attached and acting as a brace).  </li>
      <li>My speculation is this would probably work better with an inferior vacuum perhaps, because on my current setup the airflow is a little intense.</li>
      <li>Wahl discontinued the old kit or I&#x27;d have ordered&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
      <li>old boys barber style.</li>
      <li>This unit installed on my clippers, makes for a no mess, no itch haircut.</li>
      <li>The suction (from a 2.5 HP small shop vac) both keeps the area totally clean (no hair anywhere on me, the chair, or the floor), and makes my hair stand up to all get cut to the desired stand-off length.  </li>
      <li>I guess the occasional user could make do with the stock hose, but it kept kinking on me and being an old grouch, I got irritated.</li>
      <li>I had been looking for a vacuum chipper for some time and decided to purchase this along with the Wahl Professional WA8451 Hair Clipper.</li>
      <li>Cutting hair with no mess, amazing.</li>
      <li>Upon going to two other large retailers, we found that none of the Wahl models they carried in stock would work with the vacuum as well.</li>

<li> I had been looking for a vacuum chipper for some time and decided to purchase this along with the Wahl Professional WA8451 Hair Clipper.</li>
<li> Cutting hair with no mess, amazing.</li>
<li> Upon going to two other large retailers, we found that none of the Wahl models they carried in stock would work with the vacuum as well.</li>
<li> The vacuum suction worked as advertised, but my hair was short to begin with.</li>
<li> I had to vacuum a tiny bit of hair off of everyone&#x27;s shirt and that was all.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m eventually going to make an inline adapter that attaches to this adapter that relieves some of the vacuum generated by my Ridgid.</li>
<li> So I decided to buy the wahl 5 star clippers and the vacuum kit.</li>
<li> You can even use the vacuum to pull hair out a bit from your head and then trim off (using no guard).</li>
<li> It tends to vibrate and make a rattle noise when the vacuum is on.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used a Wahl vacuum accessory kit for over 20 years, but</li>
<li> This kit installed well on my WA8451 Wahl hair clippers and works well with my Ridgid portable vacuum.</li>
<li> Once the correct cover is installed onto the clipper, the cover for the vacuum chamber snaps into place, the hose and hose lock ring is attached, then the cord and hose grommets can be installed to make a neat assembly.</li>
<li> I did vacuum the floor when I was done, but that was because the vacuum was out.</li>
<li> vacuum</li>
<li> I have 3 little boys 1,2, and 3 years old.  </li>
<li> and I had to cut his hair over two days because he wouldn&#x27;t sit still for long.</li>
<li> The Vacuum Conversion Kit comes with 2 covers (one for the Wahl Senior clipper and one for all other Wahl clippers.)</li>
<li> My only complaint would be that storage is more difficult with the hose attached unless you take it apart each time.</li>
<li> If you start with long hair, I&#x27;m not sure if you can expect the same results...</li>
<li> but that would be expected I suppose.</li>
<li> Only complaint is that the vaccum hose kinks (it&#x27;s very thin plastic like material)  other than that easy to install (with the Wahl Improved Senior Clipper #8500)  </li>
<li> didn&#x27;t work with my other Wahl clippers</li>
<li> The one complex part is the order of the little rubber rings that hold the power cord to the vacuum flex tube - they have to be in place before you snap the flex tube onto the vacuum back/housing that you&#x27;ve attached to your clipper.  </li>
<li> It was a mess</li>
<li> Does not fit all Wahl vibrating clippers.</li>
<li> I have an autistic son who cannot tolerate having hair all over his face and neck.</li>
<li> My autistic son did not complain at all.</li>
<li> Taking him to get a hair cut was a nightmare until I finally realized that the hair was beyond irritating to him.</li>
<li> He still didn&#x27;t hold still, but there was no screaming and crying.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a bit tedious to get the cord keeper rings aligned at roughly equal segments down the tube, I ended up intentionally spiraling the cord down the tube</li>
<li> no more mess with hairs</li>

    <li> It works for my balding 5star wahl clippers.the reason only 4 star rating is the hose.for what you pay the hose should be stronger.it kinks up to easy..</li>
    <li> works wonderful. I do recommend, it&#x27;s light, easy to handle and easy to assembly.  the package arrived in a timely manner, which was nice. I ordered while on vacation and it arrived a day after I returned.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It tends to vibrate and make a rattle noise when the vacuum is on.  Besides that I like it.</li>
    <li> One of the best purchases I ever made - works great for me.  I may be a very simple case, since I just use a # 1.5 standoff everywhere for what hair remains on my head.  The suction (from a 2.5 HP small shop vac) both keeps the area totally clean (no hair anywhere on me, the chair, or the floor), and makes my hair stand up to all get cut to the desired stand-off length.  The kit was very easy to assemble, good instructions and intuitive &amp;#34;this should go here, that should go there&amp;#34; simplicity.  The one complex part is the order of the little rubber rings that hold the power cord to the vacuum flex tube - they have to be in place before you snap the flex tube onto the vacuum back/housing that you&#x27;ve attached to your clipper.  It&#x27;s a bit tedious to get the cord keeper rings aligned at roughly equal segments down the tube, I ended up intentionally spiraling the cord down the tube so maybe I made it harder than it needed to be, but it really works great now.  I think this &amp;#34;cord spiral&amp;#34; may be a partial antidote for those who found the tube to kink too easily (it can, but it doesn&#x27;t where the cord is attached and acting as a brace).  That is not a big problem for me.</li>
    <li> I have 3 little boys 1,2, and 3 years old.  Cutting their hair used to be a nightmare, they would scream bloody murder.  Now they fight to go first.  They love having their hair cut now that the hair doesn&#x27;t get in their eyes, nose and mouth.  Only complaint is that the vaccum hose kinks (it&#x27;s very thin plastic like material)  other than that easy to install (with the Wahl Improved Senior Clipper #8500)  didn&#x27;t work with my other Wahl clippers so make sure you have a Wahl clipper that will work with this kit.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> works great , helps make my hair cuts nice and no cleanup after.</li>
    <li> wonderful attachment. does an excellent job as advertised. Great to do business with. Thankyou so much.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Awesome company! Thanks</li>
    <li> Does not fit all Wahl vibrating clippers. Be sure to check your clippers to make sure the screw placements match the placements on the conversion piece. Otherwise, arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> I have two young boys and they have always hated getting their haircut because of the itchy feeling from the hair. This has totally solved that problem. It was very easy to install and works well. The hose does kink but it&#x27;s not a problem if you&#x27;re paying attention to it. My only complaint would be that storage is more difficult with the hose attached unless you take it apart each time. A shoebox sized plastic container may be the solution for that but I have yet to try it.</li>
    <li> The hose pinches when the vacuum is on and the hair can&#x27;t be sucked through, thus defeating the purpose of eliminating the need to clean up hair.  The hair just builds up around the clipper blades.  I&#x27;ve used a Wahl vacuum accessory kit for over 20 years, but&lt;br /&gt;the clipper attachment has cracked, which is the reason for ordering the new one.  Wahl discontinued the old kit or I&#x27;d have ordered&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this does not fit all Wahl clippers, even with the two included adaptor options. Seems like it would be simple enough to include a couple more adapters, particularly since this is not an inexpensive kit.</li>
    <li> On the specification there should be something that indicates which Wahl products this conversion kit work with.  I paid for the shipment but had to go to the post office to pay for additional shipping charges to receive the shipment.  Once home I tried it and found that it did not work so I had to return it but be aware that not only do the customer pay to return but the seller deducts 15% of the money he will return to the customer, so even if it doesn&#x27;t work and is return, the seller still makes money.  I also had to e-mail through Amazon after 2 or 3 weeks because I had not heard anything or received a refund.  I will never again buy anything from this seller.</li>
    <li> Big savings not having to go to the barber shop.  I get a very clean next cut.</li>
    <li> We purchased this to add to our current Wahl clippers we purchased from a local retailer. We found that it did not work with them unless we used tape or rubber bands. Upon going to two other large retailers, we found that none of the Wahl models they carried in stock would work with the vacuum as well. We did order a correct one from Amazon it works great. Just be aware that it will most likely not work with Wahl products you purchase from large retailers. But otherwise this setup works very well! That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my father for Christmas this year and he loves it! I also bought a small shop vac that he could attach the hose ending to and it works perfectly! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a vacuum chipper for some time and decided to purchase this along with the Wahl Professional WA8451 Hair Clipper. The Vacuum Conversion Kit comes with 2 covers (one for the Wahl Senior clipper and one for all other Wahl clippers.) Even though it did not specifically list the WA8451, the non-senior cover fit perfectly. Assembly was very easy as long as you have a #1 philips screwdriver to remove and replace the 3 screws (the more common #2 philips screwdriver is just too big.) Once the correct cover is installed onto the clipper, the cover for the vacuum chamber snaps into place, the hose and hose lock ring is attached, then the cord and hose grommets can be installed to make a neat assembly. Once I turned the unit on, the top cover of the vacuum chamber caused a noise due to the vibration, but the noise stop once I held the clipper during normal use. The vacuum suction worked as advertised, but my hair was short to begin with. If you start with long hair, I&#x27;m not sure if you can expect the same results... but that would be expected I suppose.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, just need to have the right razor. It kind of seems that this will fit all razors but not so. You need one with the right screw pattern (4 screws on the back).&lt;br /&gt;  I had a \\&quot;color pro\\&quot; or whatever from WalMart and it would not work.&lt;br /&gt;No real problem I just bought another razor online and it worked great.. I think you are looking for \\&quot;professional\\&quot; or something like that in the description of the razor. I looked at the pictures and saw the 4 screws on the back.&lt;br /&gt;  The attachment basically replaces the back cover on the original unit. Once installed this was a dream.. no more mess with hairs everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;  You can even use the vacuum to pull hair out a bit from your head and then trim off (using no guard). I did this around my ears and it worked great.</li>
    <li> I have an autistic son who cannot tolerate having hair all over his face and neck. Taking him to get a hair cut was a nightmare until I finally realized that the hair was beyond irritating to him. When I finally did realize what the problem was I started telling the barber to buzz the front while my son looked at the ceiling. It went much better, though he still doesn&#x27;t hold very still and his haircuts never looked that great. Imagine trying to shave a cat on a pogo stick. So I thought I&#x27;d try at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband bought a Remington clipper and I tried using that. It was a mess and I had to cut his hair over two days because he wouldn&#x27;t sit still for long. The clippers kept getting clogged because his hair is so thick and he would end up screaming from the hair all over him. It was awful. So I decided to buy the wahl 5 star clippers and the vacuum kit. The best purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried hooking it up to my Kirby, but that has an angled tube, so I had to get out my small canister vac. It worked so well I couldn&#x27;t believe it. There was only a tiny bit of hair on their shirts. I did my husband, and my two boys. That&#x27;s how quick it went. I am not a pro. I&#x27;ve never cut hair until my husband got the Remington. So we&#x27;re talking about 3 or 4 times. But this clipper with the vac attachment made it so easy. There was hardly any mess. When I tell you I could have done it in my kitchen I am not kidding. I had to vacuum a tiny bit of hair off of everyone&#x27;s shirt and that was all. I did vacuum the floor when I was done, but that was because the vacuum was out. I didn&#x27;t see any hair on my white tile floor. My autistic son did not complain at all. He still didn&#x27;t hold still, but there was no screaming and crying. I would highly recommend this to anyone. Cutting hair with no mess, amazing. And the clippers by the way, also awesome. Went through the thick hair like butter.</li>
    <li> Neither of the covers that came with the kit fit my Wahl clipper.  Beware--if you need to return the item to the seller, you would need to pay for return shipping as well as 20% re-stocking fee.  So don&#x27;t make the same mistake and make sure it will fit your clipper first before ordering.</li>
    <li> I was a barber for 40 years, and the first shop I worked at used Wahl vacuum clippers.Though I&#x27;m retired now, I still cut some family and friends hair.This unit installed on my clippers, makes for a no mess, no itch haircut.Kids really appreciate this. My only complaint is that the supplied hose is crap.I use a C- pap machine when I sleep, so I have an endless supply of really quality hoses that fit the Wahl Vacuum Clipper attachment like a glove.I guess the occasional user could make do with the stock hose, but it kept kinking on me and being an old grouch, I got irritated.But, with my C-pap hose mod, this item is fantastic.Easy ti install, and easy to use.My wiggly, itchy grandsons, and great nephews are very grateful.</li>
    <li> This and the Wahl Five Star Magic Professional Hair Clipper Model 8451 really does the trick. I own a 5 gal. vacuum and it really saves me time and money  cutting my 3 and 7 yr. old boys barber style.</li>
    <li> This kit installed well on my WA8451 Wahl hair clippers and works well with my Ridgid portable vacuum. The airflow with this particular vacuum is so great that I must momentarily pull the hose seat off of the end of my Ridgid gulper hose in order to oil my blades or the oil will particulate directly into the air stream. My speculation is this would probably work better with an inferior vacuum perhaps, because on my current setup the airflow is a little intense. I&#x27;m eventually going to make an inline adapter that attaches to this adapter that relieves some of the vacuum generated by my Ridgid.</li>
