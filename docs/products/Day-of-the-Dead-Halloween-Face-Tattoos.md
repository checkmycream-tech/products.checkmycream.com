      <li>My daughter looked so cute in it!.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply lasted all night for my awesome 40th Dia de Los Muertos birthday celebration and just as easy to come off.</li>
      <li>The tattoos are great even though not all of it would fit on my face</li>
      <li>I ended up painting some of my own designs with eyeliner</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find these temp tattoos.  </li>
      <li>We loved the cute design and ease in applying.</li>
      <li>Very cute idea and cute designs though.  </li>
      <li>Also crack very easy after drying</li>
      <li>Easy to apply!</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>So when ordering please make sure you tell the seller that you want the one shown.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the product.</li>
      <li>and it said that my shipment would be delivered October 15th at the latest.</li>
      <li>Maybe I just need more practice.  </li>
      <li>we ended up not using it and did a better job free hand with face paint.</li>
      <li>Looks great on, easy to apply &amp; not messy</li>
      <li>Really cool!</li>
      <li>I got rave reviews, I found it easy to place, but took 30 minutes of scrubbing to remove</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and remove</li>
      <li>love it will be great for next Halloween</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and gorgeous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>All the tattoos pictured were included, and each of the designs was easy to cut out.</li>
      <li>Lots of fun!</li>
      <li>Stayed on my face all night and was pretty easy to apply</li>
      <li>All you have to do is follow the instructions exactly as outlined &amp; you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
      <li>Quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Be sure you allot yourself ample time to apply as it is time consuming and the best scissor to use to cut it out would be like a cuticle scissors with curved blade and small enough to get around the images.</li>
      <li>I was able to get a few in place and they looked pretty good.  </li>
      <li>Really fun.</li>
      <li>but well worth it</li>
      <li>Super fast shipping as well.</li>
      <li>also love how well it stays on and it keeps yr makeup free other than around the eyes.</li>
      <li>A bit time consuming to put on, but not difficult.</li>
      <li>Was great, but expensive since it originally comes with 2 sets of tattoos.</li>
      <li>and it was very helpful.</li>
      <li>Had to really scrub with baby oil and my face was sore.</li>
      <li>I also found that if a section of the tattoo wasn&#x27;t sticking to my face as I was pulling the paper off I could use a damp q-tip to gently press it onto my face and that seemed to work really well.</li>
      <li>Shipping was extremely fast and I thank you for that.</li>
      <li>face swell and both are much faster to apply compared to face painting the face a lot cleaner swell.</li>
      <li>which was much easier.  </li>
      <li>Keep in mind that I didn&#x27;t use any costume makeup on my face, so I only know that it holds well without extra makeup, such as the kind used in the image.</li>
      <li>this was so fun last Halloween!</li>
      <li>They are a little hard to apply since your face has curves but they were exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
      <li>but I had a hard time getting all the pieces on because I didn&#x27;t do a good job of planning out where the bigger pieces would go.</li>
      <li>For someone who has no creative skills whatsoever, this tattoo kit was really simple to use &amp; the results were amazing.</li>
      <li>Removal was tough, even with rubbing alcohol, but that&#x27;s kind of what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>I would also recommend putting the bigger pieces on first and maybe use a eye liner pencil to mark out where the pieces will go before you actually start applying them.</li>
      <li>These were hard to get on and off, however they were very cool once we got them on.</li>
      <li>The only thing was that with this specific tattoo, I was unable to fit the two roses you see on the model&#x27;s forehead on MY forehead--but I didn&#x27;t need them--it looked perfectly fine without it.</li>
      <li>You have to be very careful with how you apply them and make sure they&#x27;re not too wet or to dry because either way they will follow part.</li>
      <li>It was high quality and looked just like I expected it to, from the picture.</li>

<li> It was high quality and looked just like I expected it to, from the picture.</li>
<li> Products is descent some of the tattoes can break if u don&#x27;t wet them enough especially the larger ones but all in all it worked out.</li>
<li> I cut out a few of them from the main sheet of tattoos (you&#x27;ll probably need small scissors or steady hands).</li>
<li> It may be more helpful if they were sent in a larger sheet to decrease the chances of cutting a surrounding tattoo.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t take much moisture to apply the tattoos and when they dried, they weren&#x27;t itchy like the facial tattoos of my previous experiences.</li>
<li> It is tedious and takes lots of patience but worth it.</li>
<li> Go slow and if possible have someone help you.</li>
<li> My makeup was symmetrical and less time consuming to appy.</li>
<li> And it up having to leave half of the design off because of the problems.</li>
<li> but u can always finish it off with black liner</li>
<li> little trickier to remove - but it came off after a bit of work.</li>
<li> Got alot of compliments:)  Somewhat difficult to apply &amp; VERY difficult to remove.  </li>
<li> It took a long time and was frustrating.  </li>
<li> They did not guarantee that it would be delivered on time or what happened, just that they would &amp;#34;re-ship the order with no time guarantee.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s also no tracking packages through them which is shady.</li>
<li> I ordered this for the day of the dead celebration but it arrived one day to late</li>
<li> start off with a couple of small pieces and test it out.</li>
<li> Nouse and eyes are hard to get</li>
<li> It was a lititle hard to get off</li>
<li> a bit difficult to put on</li>
<li> The instructions look like it might be difficult to apply but I will find out this year.</li>
<li> It was a bit difficult to remove, however if you are patient, it will come off .</li>
<li> Maybe I did something wrong</li>
<li> does not work around eyes, very difficult to apply</li>
<li> I followed the instructions and even looked up a video online on how to do this, but I had a terrible time.  </li>

    <li> It worked reLly good. Nouse and eyes are hard to get but u can always finish it off with black liner</li>

    <li> Awesome for costume party. A bit time consuming to put on, but not difficult. I did have some difficulty with the removal, after I wore them for several hours. Had to really scrub with baby oil and my face was sore.</li>
    <li> I had the hardest time getting these to stick to my face.  I followed the instructions and even looked up a video online on how to do this, but I had a terrible time.  The tattoos would just keep sticking to the paper.  It took a long time and was frustrating.  I was able to get a few in place and they looked pretty good.  I ended up painting some of my own designs with eyeliner which was much easier.  Maybe I just need more practice.  Very cute idea and cute designs though.  Maybe I did something wrong but I don&#x27;t know what.</li>
    <li> Just like advertised.</li>
    <li> The tattoos are great even though not all of it would fit on my face lol. However, I did not receive the one that is in the picture I got a different tattoo, it still had roses and webs but was a different tattoo. So when ordering please make sure you tell the seller that you want the one shown.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for the day of the dead celebration but it arrived one day to late so I haven&#x27;t used it yet. The instructions look like it might be difficult to apply but I will find out this year.</li>
    <li> this was so fun last Halloween!</li>
    <li> These were perfect temporary tattoos. Easy to apply lasted all night for my awesome 40th Dia de Los Muertos birthday celebration and just as easy to come off. Can&#x27;t wait for Halloween to order more!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use  it.  I don&#x27;t know if I will.</li>
    <li> These will not stick to your eyebrows. So don&#x27;t attempt to apply them there. I just cut that part off and used i liner.</li>
    <li> Looks great on, easy to apply &amp; not messy</li>
    <li> Looked GREAT! Got alot of compliments:)  Somewhat difficult to apply &amp; VERY difficult to remove.  Had to use &amp;#34;dis-solve it&amp;#34; ouch! Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I am not an artist but wanted to do a Dia de los Muertos costume for Halloween. I was thrilled to find these temp tattoos.  They looked good for 2 days, and I had to use rubbing alcohol to remove them.</li>
    <li> does not work around eyes, very difficult to apply</li>
    <li> This will allow me to apply the look I want without doing it with makeup that will run when I start dancing and sweating. Can&#x27;t wait to be anonymous at the Halloween parties I will be attending.</li>
    <li> The temporary tattoos were great to use. My makeup was symmetrical and less time consuming to appy. It may be more helpful if they were sent in a larger sheet to decrease the chances of cutting a surrounding tattoo.</li>
    <li> I used these tattoos for a Halloween party and they were such a hit! I had several people ask if I had painted my face. It was time consuming to get all the tattoos on and get my eyes painted. Plan on about 45 minutes. It is tedious and takes lots of patience but worth it. I watched the video on YouTube and it was very helpful. I also found that if a section of the tattoo wasn&#x27;t sticking to my face as I was pulling the paper off I could use a damp q-tip to gently press it onto my face and that seemed to work really well. I would also recommend putting the bigger pieces on first and maybe use a eye liner pencil to mark out where the pieces will go before you actually start applying them. I don&#x27;t have a tiny face but I had a hard time getting all the pieces on because I didn&#x27;t do a good job of planning out where the bigger pieces would go. Even with that I would definitely recommend these! Lots of fun! Go slow and if possible have someone help you.</li>
    <li> Do NOT order through tattoofun. I placed an order October 5th and it said that my shipment would be delivered October 15th at the latest. It&#x27;s now October 27th and still no delivery. I contacted them and they were no help. They did not guarantee that it would be delivered on time or what happened, just that they would &amp;#34;re-ship the order with no time guarantee.&amp;#34; There&#x27;s also no tracking packages through them which is shady. Stay away!</li>
    <li> All the tattoos pictured were included, and each of the designs was easy to cut out. It didn&#x27;t take much moisture to apply the tattoos and when they dried, they weren&#x27;t itchy like the facial tattoos of my previous experiences. They stayed on all night and didn&#x27;t crack or flake. Removal was tough, even with rubbing alcohol, but that&#x27;s kind of what I was looking for. Keep in mind that I didn&#x27;t use any costume makeup on my face, so I only know that it holds well without extra makeup, such as the kind used in the image.</li>
    <li> It was a lititle hard to get off but it stayed on great!! I was pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. Kudos to Bewild for delivering it in time so I could actually use it for Halloween. For someone who has no creative skills whatsoever, this tattoo kit was really simple to use &amp; the results were amazing. All you have to do is follow the instructions exactly as outlined &amp; you&#x27;ll be fine. I chose to put this on without makeup for a non-traditional look &amp; it looked great. The only thing was that with this specific tattoo, I was unable to fit the two roses you see on the model&#x27;s forehead on MY forehead--but I didn&#x27;t need them--it looked perfectly fine without it. I would totally order this again!!</li>
    <li> Luv it! Simply to apply, simply to remove! Lasted! My daughter looked so cute in it!. We cut it up for multi-use. We will purchase more like this!</li>
    <li> Stayed on my face all night and was pretty easy to apply</li>
    <li> never recieved the product and as a matter of fact i cancelled this order, so i hope i was refunded my money</li>
    <li> Easy to apply! Great color. Removal was a bit of work but well worth it</li>
    <li> I got a tone of complements on my makeup during Halloween&lt;br /&gt;I also love how well it stays on and it keeps yr makeup free other than around the eyes. Its awesome and I also purchased the male tattoo day of the dad face swell and both are much faster to apply compared to face painting the face a lot cleaner swell.</li>
    <li> Adorable!!! We loved the cute design and ease in applying. Shipping was extremely fast and I thank you for that.</li>
    <li> Really fun. Worked perfectly for my Dia de Los Muertos costume! Would order again!</li>
    <li> Bought two of these as a precaution because it did not look as simple as just putting these on with water. You have to be very careful with how you apply them and make sure they&#x27;re not too wet or to dry because either way they will follow part. And it up having to leave half of the design off because of the problems. Also crack very easy after drying</li>
    <li> a bit difficult to put on but once you got the hang of it ..it was great.. start off with a couple of small pieces and test it out.</li>
    <li> These worked perfectly for my costume. I cut out a few of them from the main sheet of tattoos (you&#x27;ll probably need small scissors or steady hands). They are a little hard to apply since your face has curves but they were exactly what I wanted at a great price. Super fast shipping as well.</li>
    <li> Was great, but expensive since it originally comes with 2 sets of tattoos.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and remove</li>
    <li> worked well for halloween</li>
    <li> I got rave reviews, I found it easy to place, but took 30 minutes of scrubbing to remove</li>
