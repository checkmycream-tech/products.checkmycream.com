      <li>Soft scent and over bearing, smells great.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much that I had to check it out on amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Preferred Stock is more stud-ly to me but seems to have changed from how I originally remember it</li>
      <li>and he loves it more because i love the smell ;)</li>
      <li>I love the clean fresh scent of CK1.</li>
      <li>I think “clean” would be the optimal word to describe this cologne though.  </li>
      <li>Why I like it: Long-lasting, crisp, citrus-like, and not too strong.</li>
      <li>It smells clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>I just simply love these perfumes &#x3D;-) Highly recommended</li>
      <li>It has really nice smell, and it is suitable for men to wear everyday.</li>
      <li>like the fresh scent, girls like it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>But it was worth the price.</li>
      <li>I was confident ordering this online because it is shipped directly through Amazon</li>
      <li>and i didnt get a reaction of how good i smell like i usually do when i wear my burberry brit or hot water, but later in the day a couple ladies said i smelled pleasant.</li>
      <li>Ordered it right</li>
      <li>Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
      <li>If they did, I&#x27;m sure that they&#x27;d back it up.</li>
      <li>I first received it as gift in my mid-teens, and it has been one of my favorites since then</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>I love the smell i have from when i was a teen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for year and think in the past I have been sold a bogus product since it smelled more like medicine than the light citrus fragrance that came in the box this time.  </li>
      <li>fast</li>
      <li>As Paul McCartney says \\&quot;he&#x27;s very clean!\\&quot;</li>
      <li>Order arrived fast, everything as advertised.  </li>
      <li>And they packaged it really well, too.</li>
      <li>I wonder how much was the amount you charged me for the products I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
      <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like so many other products.</li>
      <li>I wasnt expecting this scent to smell the way it does, I bought it blindly just based on the reviews and because the price was pretty good, it smells like alcohol at first, but</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m looking for something new and tried this.</li>
      <li>I recommend: Can be worn around sensitive noses, can be worn by anyone!</li>
      <li>It delivery a clean smell sensation, and really last for long hours.</li>
      <li>I gave present for the Christmas present they like this Item because of the smell good they hard recommend it</li>
      <li>I suggest a person loose weight first and get a face lift to assure the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Clean, invigorating, not sugary or childish -smelling.</li>
      <li>Although I will probably not purchase this particular scent again, I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>The scent lasted only for about 5 minutes, it is completely diluted.</li>
      <li>The box was open and not secure the lid of the container, original odor Fragrance Calvin Klain and very low durability.</li>

    <li> the best perfume that have been invented, the only thing is that both men and women equally but never mind smell the perfume is very good</li>
    <li> Fast Great Magnet!    Oh my!  smell is the best!  fast</li>
    <li> All I have to say is that the women on my job always say I smell good when I wear CK One. It&#x27;z one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Calvin Klien product fan and I purchased cologne at a great price here at Amazon. I usually pay almost twice the price for Calvin Klein or other designer brand colognes. The S&amp;H was perfect(FREE)and I received faster than I expected. As always, another great purchase from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> Why I like it: Long-lasting, crisp, citrus-like, and not too strong. Clean, invigorating, not sugary or childish -smelling. I first received it as gift in my mid-teens, and it has been one of my favorites since then (I&#x27;m now 29).  I was never \\&quot;too girly\\&quot;, so this is a great alternative to the strong floral fragrances. Even my boyfriend loves it, and has used up the bottle he purchased last Valentine&#x27;s Day :|&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I recommend: Can be worn around sensitive noses, can be worn by anyone!</li>
    <li> CK one is a great product. It has really nice smell, and it is suitable for men to wear everyday.</li>
    <li> Love CK One!  I dislike heavy flower scents and CK One&#x27;s light citrusy fragrance is perfect for me!  I can wear it every day.  It&#x27;s been my signature fragrance for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> First time I have tried CK One for Men, and it is a very nice fragrance.  I wear it daily to the office, and have received several compliments.  Additionally, the price was less expensive than when I say it in the stores.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. Awesome smell. I have also worn CK Be, CK Summer, and CK 1 into her. I just simply love these perfumes &#x3D;-) Highly recommended</li>
    <li> For morning purpose, this spay is very good. It delivery a clean smell sensation, and really last for long hours.</li>
    <li> This has a nice fresh aroma --- I&#x27;ve always enjoyed it --- it&#x27;s not one of those overbearing scents. As Paul McCartney says \\&quot;he&#x27;s very clean!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> my favorite ck super good</li>
    <li> excellent product excellent, very good perfume I love and attention was immediate, as received in good condition 100% recommended you purchase another opportunity lo maximo ck ufff</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like the fresh scent, girls like it, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have to actually take the spray part off and close the lid if I want to put it in my bag for travel. Not so convenient at all.</li>
    <li> Ck One by calvin Klein for Men ,Eau de Toilette is very good fragrance .&lt;br /&gt;I satisfied and I love that parfum.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for year and think in the past I have been sold a bogus product since it smelled more like medicine than the light citrus fragrance that came in the box this time.  I&#x27;ll be buying it from this company from now on!</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described.</li>
    <li> I was at target the other night, and I randomly came across this. I really liked the smell, but it was $50! So I just walked away. I loved it so much that I had to check it out on amazon. Ordered it right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some people think it&#x27;s a fake, but it&#x27;s not. I just received mine today, and it&#x27;s the same as the one I saw in target. The only reason I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star is because of the shipping. I&#x27;ve prime, so I was suppose to receive this last week. It came 10 days later. Kind of disappointed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, it does come with a spray. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll spray it around like that.</li>
    <li> This perfume is just great. It smells clean and fresh. A+, it is because its longevity; it lasts about 8-9 hours on my skin and its scent stays on my clothes as well. I will consider CK One as one of my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> I gave present for the Christmas present they like this Item because of the smell good they hard recommend it</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle for myself after wanting it for a while, and it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon, so why not? I was confident ordering this online because it is shipped directly through Amazon and I don&#x27;t think Amazon would sell fake stuff. If they did, I&#x27;m sure that they&#x27;d back it up. Anyway, this is the legit CK One. I bought a bottle for my mom after I found out it&#x27;s legit. And they packaged it really well, too. No way anything could&#x27;ve gotten damaged, and nothing did. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer of this product, twice in a row. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell i have from when i was a teen. got it for my husband and he likes the smell too and he loves it more because i love the smell ;)</li>
    <li> I love that Calvin Klein makes one fragrance for either a man or a woman!  Okay... I admit sometimes I LIKE the MENs fragrances even more than the WOMENs!!  That being said you can definitely tell this is a combination of both a man&#x27;s and woman&#x27;s fragrance.  You can pick up hints of each in this cologne. It&#x27;s spicy yet very clean smelling. I think “clean” would be the optimal word to describe this cologne though.  Not overpowering and lasts the day.  Price point is exceptional for this size and it&#x27;s a prime product!!!</li>
    <li> I love the clean fresh scent of CK1. Also, it doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies like so many other products. It is all my husband wears.</li>
    <li> very original. recommend the product. very good fragrance.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> I wasnt expecting this scent to smell the way it does, I bought it blindly just based on the reviews and because the price was pretty good, it smells like alcohol at first, but after i let it sit for like a week, i went back to smell it and it smelled good. I wore it to work one morning and i didnt get a reaction of how good i smell like i usually do when i wear my burberry brit or hot water, but later in the day a couple ladies said i smelled pleasant. So its not to shabby i guess. Nothing i would bend over backwards to get though.</li>
    <li> Still smells like I remember in high school - very good.  1990s scent in 2012, but it still works.  Order arrived fast, everything as advertised.  No complaints here.</li>
    <li> I got this online for my dad and my husband has already tried and liked it. Its a nice subtle tone and this amazon price online makes it even better.</li>
    <li> I love the fragrance but I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last long. But it was worth the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just the fact that I am not able to smell it after awhile, but I am fairly certain the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should. I&#x27;ve used CK products before and they have never diminished after one 8-hour shift. Anyone else experiencing this issue?</li>
    <li> I found this perfume about 10 years ago, and I just loved the scent. And while I do like the way it smells on me, the scent just doesn&#x27;t seem to last for very long. Maybe it&#x27;s a body chemistry issue?? Although I will probably not purchase this particular scent again, I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, I have been wearing it for years.  This fragrance is for those ladies (like me) that totally love the smell of men&#x27;s cologne and have always wanted to use a man&#x27;s cologne but were afraid to actually wear a man&#x27;s cologne.  This scent strikes a perfect balance between a womens and man&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I Love It!!!</li>
    <li> Hello. I wonder how much was the amount you charged me for the products I&#x27;ve purchased. Just to check.&lt;br /&gt;Bye</li>
    <li> The box was open and not secure the lid of the container, original odor Fragrance Calvin Klain and very low durability. Please report on the Product and provide facilities for repayment. Thank you.</li>
    <li> The scent lasted only for about 5 minutes, it is completely diluted. Consider buying it from reputed stores instead. The price difference is due to it being completely diluted.</li>
    <li> I give most colognes a 4 rating if I will wear them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the women like it but I have yet to be mobbed by them. I suggest a person loose weight first and get a face lift to assure the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell is undefinably somewhat neutral not masculine though could be called slightly feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Preferred Stock is more stud-ly to me but seems to have changed from how I originally remember it so I&#x27;m looking for something new and tried this.</li>
    <li> I have always loved CK One and haven&#x27;t had it in years so I decided to buy it again and I am so glad that I did!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been around for years, but I don&#x27;t get tired of the smell. I still use it and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.. good stuff..</li>
    <li> i got this for my daughter for christmas and already gave it to her i also wear this and we both love it great service will order from them again</li>
    <li> This has always been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and it smells great on her! Soft scent and over bearing, smells great.</li>
