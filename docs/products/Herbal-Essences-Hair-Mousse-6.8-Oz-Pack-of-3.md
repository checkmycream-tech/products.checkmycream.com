      <li>The price on this is good.</li>
      <li>eliminates frizz and good curl without the crunch</li>
      <li>I loved this product...</li>
      <li>Good product by itself.  </li>
      <li>But otherwise it&#x27;s super lightweight and gives me the best, defined waves.</li>
      <li>I love the way these Herbal Essence products smell and they work great on my hair.</li>
      <li>, it is so smoothie and has a great quality, I&#x27;m so pleased with the product</li>
      <li>When used as a combination product, it it quite good, but I wind up having to use a lot of it for it to be effective, so I took off a star.</li>

      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>It helps keep frizz at bay and defines your hair somewhat, but for best results with wavy/curly hair, use a hair gel first for your hair type, then scrunch this mousse in.  </li>

      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I have people ask me what I use in my hair all the time because they love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>a trusted favorite.  </li>
      <li>I love that the smell lasts a while.</li>
      <li>this is the mousse we love at my house</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>What more can we ask for?</li>
      <li>It was absolutely the most amazing hair product I have ever used !</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
      <li>Great for natural curl!</li>
      <li>Smells great, holds strong without being overly crunchy and helps your natural curls show</li>
      <li>I decided to try this mousse because I&#x27;ve seen great reviews as far as using it on curly AND fine hair, which is my case.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s in though- easy to use</li>
      <li>This mousse is good, but definitely cannot be used on its own.  </li>
      <li>I then use a strong hair spray to help maintain the volume throughout the day</li>
      <li>(my hair is really fine).  </li>
      <li>and we all used this and had amazing hair, even the girls who wore their hair straight.</li>
      <li>After drying my hair, I use this mousse for styling and it&#x27;s incredibly light.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ok using it right now, but won&#x27;t reorder this product.  </li>
      <li>However, with this mousse, my hair stays exactly the same until I go to bed at night, despite the heat &amp; humidity, which is INCREDIBLE.</li>
      <li>I would be more than willing to order from this supplier though.</li>
      <li>It does the job but not anything special.</li>
      <li>It does the best job on my naturally curly hair by a long shot.  </li>
      <li>gives manageable curls a boost, does nothing for straight hair &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It works amazingly, and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
      <li>I am in love with this stuff I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>I think that benefit alone is worth continuing to use this product.</li>
      <li>Is it worth the money?</li>
      <li>This is really incredible because, no matter which products I&#x27;d tried in the past (and there&#x27;d been lots!)</li>
      <li>However.....it does get rid of frizz, adds shine to my hair, and, most importantly, maintains my style (volume &amp; all) ALL DAY LONG!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been true to this mousse since high school!</li>
      <li>Not really much of a fragrance, more a light flowerly smell</li>
      <li>:) Overall, I recommend.</li>
      <li>This is great for my thick, curly hair.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair from getting frizzy, keeps curls together, and provides really pretty</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d have to use more hair spray to bring it back to life.</li>
      <li>Thanks for offering it this way!</li>
      <li>Good price but very little curl or bounce with this mouse.  </li>
      <li>Must use a bit more than expected but will hold the curls for a while</li>
      <li>remember having a bunch of friends over when I was 16 to get ready for a winter formal</li>
      <li>I have very curly here and this product works well and prevents frizziness.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t give much hold.</li>
      <li>Simple ingredients, light hold, affordable pricing.</li>
      <li>not my favorite curls shaping product so far, but it worked well enough.</li>
      <li>I have been using this mousse for the past 2 years and LOVE it!  </li>
      <li>This mousse holds my hair better than any other mousse.  </li>
      <li>I go throught this stuff like mad and the smell is the best part!</li>
      <li>Just a typical mousse :)</li>
      <li>To be able to purchase 3 at a time for less than I can by going to the store...</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t any more wavy with this, but I think for men it works well enough if you have short hair.  </li>
      <li>I have super thick, curly hair that easily becomes frizzy and tangled if I don&#x27;t put some product in it.  </li>
      <li>Then I wrap my hair in a turban towel for a few more minutes</li>
      <li>/&gt;After 8 (wow!) years of using Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse and having plenty of time to explore many similar products out there, I can honestly say this is my holy grail hair</li>
      <li>After all, everyone can see my hair, but far less people will be touching it.</li>
      <li>It gives my hair just the right amount of curl enhancement when I blowdry it on a low setting and scrunch the hair throughout the drying process.  </li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again just because i like other products better, but if this was my only choice i wouldn&#x27;t be that upset about it either.</li>
      <li>Not sure I&#x27;d pay more than $3-4 for a can</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking around and trying other products with more natural ingredients, but keep coming back to this.  </li>
      <li>I put it in right after showering (I use quite a bit) and either let it air dry or use a diffuser sparingly.  </li>
      <li>controls my curls, can either have it crunchy or soft.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair lost its natural curl when I use this product.</li>
      <li>It gives a natural look and no flakes.</li>
      <li>but I use it for my short, straight hair and it works well.  </li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
      <li>it arrived on time, no damage, and was professionally packaged.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this stuff is alright. not my favorite curls shaping product so far, but it worked well enough. didn&#x27;t last very long, but it wasn&#x27;t overpriced either. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again just because i like other products better, but if this was my only choice i wouldn&#x27;t be that upset about it either.</li>
    <li> a trusted favorite.  eliminates frizz and good curl without the crunch</li>
    <li> Creates a white flaky mess even when washed out every day.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my hair manageable for a few days.  I have super thick, curly hair that easily becomes frizzy and tangled if I don&#x27;t put some product in it.  Most products I&#x27;ve used in the past leave my hair greasy or make it hang limp in less than a day.&lt;br /&gt;With the mousse, I can keep my pretty curls and have all the options to pull my hair back or leave it down.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this stuff I have naturally curly hair but it can be difficult to deal with... I add this to my wet hair and let dry naturally over night and can just wake up and go to work without having to deal with my hair.</li>
    <li> some of them I can hardly get the foam out, I have to push so hard it hurts my finger.</li>
    <li> Not that great. It doesn&#x27;t give much hold. My hair goes limp right away and looks frizzy.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smelling great and boosts curls. Not sure I&#x27;d pay more than $3-4 for a can but it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
    <li> My daughter cannot do without this product for her curly locks!</li>
    <li> Good product by itself.  I found that it flaked when layered with other products and had a drying effect on my hair</li>
    <li> I like it, it hold great but my hubby thinks I used mash potatoes for my hair when I use it... What does he know. I like it!</li>
    <li> This Mousse works well.  I don&#x27;t have curly hair, nor do I want it but I use it for my short, straight hair and it works well.  My hair isn&#x27;t any more wavy with this, but I think for men it works well enough if you have short hair.  No caking and lasts all day.  Not really much of a fragrance, more a light flowerly smell but I&#x27;d recommend this product to others and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Great deal! Great product</li>
    <li> It kept the frizz from my curls without being crunchy at all.</li>
    <li> It was absolutely the most amazing hair product I have ever used ! .... I have been trying different products with different price range ! My hair is thick and curly and long an today I applied some of this brand on my towel-dried hair and couldn&#x27;t believe how it worked after 10 minutes... ! shiny beautiful curls with  NO fuzz . I loved this product... I hardly ever write reviews but this  product was like a miracle and worthy to let other people know how it works ! Also thanks for all the good informative reviews; I purchased based on the very good reviews and i&#x27;m so happy they were all really true for my hair as well !</li>
    <li> I love this. controls my curls, can either have it crunchy or soft.</li>
    <li> I have long full curly red hair. It can look really awesome or really awful. This makes it look really awesome most of the time. I have to apply the mouse when it is still really wet, and it also depends on the weather whether my hair will curl or frizz that day. Without mousse or gel my hair is almost always awful. This is the best mousse I&#x27;ve found yet. I&#x27;ve never tried anything expensive. The price on this is good. Gel is cheap but too 80&#x27;s with its stiff wet look. And greasiness. I use a lot of this product on my hair. About 2 cups each morning of product.</li>
    <li> I love the way these Herbal Essence products smell and they work great on my hair.</li>
    <li> Is it worth the money? Yes. Is it a good product? No</li>
    <li> I love the product. I use this mousse in my hair daily. I have very curly thick hair and this mousse controls the frizz without making my &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;. The reason I gave this product two stars is because the package the item came in was AWFUL. The box was wet and the side that was wet was missing a panel. So, basically, I had open box with my items hanging out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this mousse for the past 2 years and LOVE it!  It gives my hair just the right amount of curl enhancement when I blowdry it on a low setting and scrunch the hair throughout the drying process.  To be able to purchase 3 at a time for less than I can by going to the store...I am ALL in!  Thanks for offering it this way!</li>
    <li> Essential if you have wavy or culy hair. I go throught this stuff like mad and the smell is the best part!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around and trying other products with more natural ingredients, but keep coming back to this.  It does the best job on my naturally curly hair by a long shot.  I put it in right after showering (I use quite a bit) and either let it air dry or use a diffuser sparingly.  It keeps my hair from getting frizzy, keeps curls together, and provides really pretty texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides are that it can leave some flakiness if not evenly distributed.  Can also leave hair a little &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s easily fixed by running fingers through hair afterwards.  You&#x27;ll need to wash those fingers too, because it can get a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still the best styling product for me and my curls, and very affordable!</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect condition, smells great. Doesn&#x27;t leave residue in my hair like the other herbal essence mousse does. Subscribe and save it cheaper than buying in the store even with a coupon.</li>
    <li> I buy again and again.  Great for natural curl!</li>
    <li> Smells great, holds strong without being overly crunchy and helps your natural curls show</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! I love it, it is so smoothie and has a great quality, I&#x27;m so pleased with the product</li>
    <li> Great product! I have naturally curly hair.  This product prevents my hair from looking bad, especially on really humid days.</li>
    <li> This mousse holds my hair better than any other mousse.  It fights frizz.  I&#x27;ve been true to this mousse since high school!</li>
    <li> this is the mousse we love at my house and it was stopped in our local CVS, so we had to look elsewhere. gives manageable curls a boost, does nothing for straight hair &#x3D;)~</li>
    <li> I have moderately curly, somewhat mixed-texture hair.  I have found that one side of my head is curlier than the other.  In an effort to cut my time down in the morning, I gave up straightening my hair, and was searching for products that I could put into my hair and have it air dry without getting too frizzy or being flat.  I started using Herbal Essences when Citre Shine discontinued some of its products that I was using.  This mousse is good, but definitely cannot be used on its own.  It helps keep frizz at bay and defines your hair somewhat, but for best results with wavy/curly hair, use a hair gel first for your hair type, then scrunch this mousse in.  When used as a combination product, it it quite good, but I wind up having to use a lot of it for it to be effective, so I took off a star.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. It does the job but not anything special. Just a typical mousse :) I like the can it&#x27;s in though- easy to use</li>
    <li> I went natural a while back and am trying different products on my hair. I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair lost its natural curl when I use this product. My hair doesn&#x27;t bounce back with the hair style I wear. I bought this product and will be using it in combination with other products I purchased to try and get different results (I don&#x27;t like to waste :))</li>
    <li> This is a truly amazing product. After drying my hair, I use this mousse for styling and it&#x27;s incredibly light. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair hard like a rock. It gives a natural look and no flakes. Simple ingredients, light hold, affordable pricing. What more can we ask for? As a plus, it adds volume to finer hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Good price but very little curl or bounce with this mouse.  I actually could really not tell I had it on other than there was a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It smells great.  It feels great in your hair.  And most importantly, it works!  I even use it when I don&#x27;t want my hair to be curly or wavy as it gives me volume without stiffness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mousse for years and although it&#x27;s cheap, it can usually get the job done when it comes to early morning stylings.</li>
    <li> I have been using this since I was 14 or so and I&#x27;m 22 now, I have ventured off and tried several other drug store products along with various high end ones to tame my frizzy, wavy hair. But I always have to have this on hand! It tames my frizz without weighing my hair down, turns my awkward limp waves into actual curves without being sticky and smells amazing without being overpowering. I have people ask me what I use in my hair all the time because they love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember having a bunch of friends over when I was 16 to get ready for a winter formal and we all used this and had amazing hair, even the girls who wore their hair straight. Point being, it seems to work just as well for everyone else as it does for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 8 (wow!) years of using Herbal Essences Totally Twisted mousse and having plenty of time to explore many similar products out there, I can honestly say this is my holy grail hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one tip, however, and that is that the trick to getting great results from this mousse is to use as little as possible (my hair is past my shoulders and thick and I only use about a quarter sized amount) and to rub it in your palms until it is liquified. Otherwise, it will be sticky and just not work as well in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This stuff broke me out in a horrible rash all over my scalp and face. It worked well, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Must use a bit more than expected but will hold the curls for a while</li>
    <li> I decided to try this mousse because I&#x27;ve seen great reviews as far as using it on curly AND fine hair, which is my case. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now (my hair is just above the shoulders) and have some mixed feelings, though I am leaning towards using it going forward, especially during the summer months, when frizz is an issue. I will typically scrunch it into my wet hair, together with a leave-in conditioner (I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t provide enough volume on its own for me), air dry for some time and then blow-dry on hot/low with a diffuser, while scrunching &amp; separating the curls. I then use a strong hair spray to help maintain the volume throughout the day (my hair is really fine).  The one big CON I have for this product is that it leaves my hair feeling REALLY dry to the touch (thus 4 stars vs. 5), which is a shame, because I&#x27;ve used products that make it feel really soft and I miss that effect. However.....it does get rid of frizz, adds shine to my hair, and, most importantly, maintains my style (volume &amp; all) ALL DAY LONG! This is really incredible because, no matter which products I&#x27;d tried in the past (and there&#x27;d been lots!), my hair will become limp/flat by mid-afternoon and I&#x27;d have to use more hair spray to bring it back to life. However, with this mousse, my hair stays exactly the same until I go to bed at night, despite the heat &amp; humidity, which is INCREDIBLE. I think that benefit alone is worth continuing to use this product. After all, everyone can see my hair, but far less people will be touching it. :) Overall, I recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything - salt sprays, mousses, gels - and nothing defines my waves better than this! It works amazingly, and leaves my hair super soft. As with any styling product, a little goes a long way - too much and it will definitely weigh your hair down. But otherwise it&#x27;s super lightweight and gives me the best, defined waves.</li>
    <li> I love that the smell lasts a while. The only thing I am not a fan of is the crunchy wet look it leaves. I have found that if you scrunch it up a little after drying that you can get rid of it.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> The seller was great -  it arrived on time, no damage, and was professionally packaged.  The product itself was disappointing.  It definitely isn&#x27;t up to par with other mousse, let alone something targeted for curly hair.  It&#x27;s results in limp curlies that feel a little gummy.  I&#x27;m ok using it right now, but won&#x27;t reorder this product.  I would be more than willing to order from this supplier though.</li>
    <li> I have very curly here and this product works well and prevents frizziness. I always have trouble finding it in the store, so it is very convenient to order it from here.</li>
    <li> This is great for my thick, curly hair. I apply it on towel dried hair and scrunch. Then I wrap my hair in a turban towel for a few more minutes and I&#x27;m good to go</li>
