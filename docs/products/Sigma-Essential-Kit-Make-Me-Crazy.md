      <li>What more can you ask for?</li>

      <li>Just like MAC Usualy brushes would cost 500 dollars at MAC for this many.</li>
      <li>and I thought this was one would be a better quality.</li>
      <li>The case is sturdy and splits apart to become two counter top cups</li>
      <li>It is cute and durable.</li>
      <li>I am really impressed with how soft these brushes are and how smooth their application is.</li>
      <li>-Pencil Brush: this also was one of my favorite brush, but again a lot of shedding.  </li>
      <li>i am really glad i bought it bcoz</li>
      <li>These are my favorite brushes ever.</li>

      <li>These brushes are so soft and they apply makeup beautifully.</li>
      <li>But to me, they are a great starter set for someone that needed new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend $400 collecting MAC brushes.</li>

      <li>The case is not space friendly.</li>
      <li>I purchased it in September, I was excited</li>
      <li>; I clean them twice a week with dish soap and olive oil mixture, and they&#x27;ve held up well without chipping or warping.</li>
      <li>The package came way before the estimated shipping time and the product included instructions on how to clean the makeup brushes.</li>
      <li>So far, I think these are better than some of my pricier brushes!</li>
      <li>they are so soft &amp; they are amazing   </li>
      <li>- they work really well with powder foundations and provide astonishing results with liquid foundations too.</li>
      <li>The purple color really put it over the top and it scored me a lot of points with the wife.</li>
      <li>Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for good quality brushes at a somewhat sensible price.</li>
      <li>also wish the purple color was more vibrant</li>
      <li>I surely recommend them to anyone who wants great quality for less money.   </li>
      <li>I would really recommend this to any woman who wants good brushes and men who want to really impress their girl.  </li>
      <li>I must say, after watching reviews on youtube, I HAD to buy these for my first real set of brushes, and im soooo glad I did</li>
      <li>Thanks sigma!!</li>
      <li>It was well worth the money</li>
      <li>of these brushes are fantastic and really give me a much better overall application of my makeup.</li>

      <li>But it&#x27;s only 100 for good quality brushes, its really soft</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my brushes!!!!! I received them in less than a week!  As soon as I opened the package I went staight to my bathroom and washed them with baby shampoo so I could use them the next day.  They were everything I expected and more. None of the brushes shed at all while I was washing them.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Was just what my daughter wanted. Perfect.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife and it came in a pretty decent time and well wrapped.  After she opened it she was amazed with the case and then amazed once again on the quality of the brushes. She immediately washed them and cleared out the other brushes to make room for these. The purple color really put it over the top and it scored me a lot of points with the wife. I would really recommend this to any woman who wants good brushes and men who want to really impress their girl.  From ordering it to delivery everything was smooth and easy. Get your girl some fellas, trust me.</li>
    <li> Just purchased these brushes for my daughter who is a make-up freak!  She loves them and commented on how easy it is to apply make-up flawlessly with the Sigma brushes.  AND, the purple ones are especially \\&quot;happy\\&quot;!  Just in time to take to the new college campus!</li>
    <li> I must say, after watching reviews on youtube, I HAD to buy these for my first real set of brushes, and im soooo glad I did because they are great! They are soft, and the handles are comfortable, not to mention, they were expected to arrive between the 15-20th, and i had them waiting for me when i came home on the 14th! I will be buying more come this christmas for my mother in teal, and my best friend, in pink. I ordered the purple. Take care of your sigma brushes, and they will take care of you for a lifetime! Thanks sigma!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! I watch a make-up artist on youtube and her channel is Make-up by Tiffany D and she is incredible!! She uses Sigma brushes and swears by them, so I HAD to get them. My boyfriend got them for me for Christmas and I am IN LOVE! I have never used brushes before, but after watching all of Tiffany&#x27;s tutorials, I felt like a pro because these brushes are so easy to use! They pick up eyeshadow really well and I even ordered a few more separate brushes from Sigma since! LOVE LOVE LOVE and I definitely recommend them to anyone who wants to have perfect make-up.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and they apply makeup beautifully. Great price for 12 essential brushes for any makeup novice or expert. I highly reccomend any sigma brush.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes for my wife as a birthday present. Not only they shipped really fast (we live in Singapore and they came in less than 10 days!) but the packaging was also excellent! Of course she loved them. The purple color is really cool, and the brushes themselves are incredibly soft, and with a solid build. The set is really well-assembled, and versatile, it caters to most of the daily make-up needs my wife has. Sigma does also include a cute little booklet explaining each single brush, and the carrier transforms in two nice brush holders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes included are: Duo Fibre, Large Powder, Large Angled Contour, Foundation, Eye Shading, Large Shade, Tapered Blending, Medium Angled Shading, Concealer, Pencil, Small Angle, Eyeliner - they work really well with powder foundations and provide astonishing results with liquid foundations too. The brushes do also wonders with eyeshades, contours and blushes. The brushes seem calibrated for big eyes, though - my wife hasn&#x27;t got any problem with that, by the way, as her eyes are two big, deep, crystal lakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a wonderful product, whose value is far beyond the price. It can easily beat way more expensive alternative such as MAC&#x27;s, for one. Buy it as soon as you can, and don&#x27;t worry if purple is not your color... they also come in black, coral and aqua! What more can you ask for? Recommended!</li>
    <li> This set of makeup brush set is perfect because it have all the important brushes that you need to make a great makeup look.  Its also perfect if you are going to travel because of the case that the brushes came in and the last thing I think that for the cualitive it have a great price for so many brushes.  Well the only thing that come to my mind about this set is that is PERFECT AND GREAT.</li>
    <li> I splurged and purchased these about a month ago. They shipped in a sturdy box with air inflated protective wrapping around the package. It shipped to an overseas location in about a week, which was really nice. When they arrived, each brush was individually wrapped in protective plastic, and then all of them were wrapped together inside the container as well. The product was exactly as the photo with dark purple handles and silver ferrules. Seemingly good product thus far; I clean them twice a week with dish soap and olive oil mixture, and they&#x27;ve held up well without chipping or warping. I&#x27;ve used all but two of the brushes so far but only because I have others that I am habitual to. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for good quality brushes at a somewhat sensible price.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the brushes, they work amazing, and if there is anyone out there that doesn&#x27;t have them then they should because they are very nice and soft, n does its job good!! :)</li>
    <li> Just like MAC Usualy brushes would cost 500 dollars at MAC for this many. But it&#x27;s only 100 for good quality brushes, its really soft and i love the color!!</li>
    <li> Sigma brushes are just the best  they are so soft &amp; they are amazing   I surely recommend them to anyone who is looking for perfect application  They also shipped them safely &amp; arrived even before the time which exactly was on time for me  Thank you</li>
    <li> These are my favorite brushes ever. After my friend introduced the Sigma Beauty kit to me, I love the texture of the brushes as well as the color. I carry them where ever I go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the Naughty Travel kit before and I loved it so much I decided to get this full set of brush.  I purchased it in September, I was excited when I first got them, I washed them before using them and right away I started having problems with a couple of them.  -Large Powder Brush: it started bleeding, i washed it a couple of times but the bleeding didn&#x27;t stop. It stained my towels when I dried them.  -Large Duo Fiber Brush: after washing it and drying it the black bristles would bleed through the white tip, the customer service told me to wash it with half teaspoon vinegar and water, I did but that didn&#x27;t stop it from bleeding through again. So I had to toss it in the trash and use my travel size.  -Large Angle Contour Brush: this was my favorite brush, it fits my cheeks for contouring and blush but it sheds like crazy! That was annoying.   -Pencil Brush: this also was one of my favorite brush, but again a lot of shedding.  Overall the rest of the brushes are fine, they get the job done, but I was disappointed with this set, I was so pleased with the travel kit and I thought this was one would be a better quality. I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing...the quality of the brushes is fantastic they are as soft as you can imagine..and the box is so cool and good quality too ..i love the color and the way they sit in the box after you open it ,,,i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll need to buy anymore brushes for soooo long..very satisfies with my purchase.it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The brushes are made with very good materials. I use them all the time, and my makeup comes out flawless.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love my Sigma brushes. I noticed that my makeup goes on much smoother. Plus the colors are amazing. All of my brushes are basic black brushes, so this added some color to my collection. The bristles are so soft!! It was well worth the money and I plan to get another set in a different color.</li>
    <li> I´m very satisfied with the quality of the produscts and delivery! In addition, the case is very luxurious! I strongly recommend these brushes.</li>
    <li> After researching I ordered these brushes through amazon since I had a gift card. Although the price point isn&#x27;t high for the amount of brushes you get, it still took me a while to finalize my order. After doing so I continued to read reviews about the company both good and bad. When my brushes arrived I was so happy and blinded that I was at first able to except some quality issues. First, they smelled very strong. I went out and bought Bare Escentuals cleaning solution, Well Cared For, that very day and cleaned all the brushes. Upon cleaning, I noticed a decent amount of hair came off four of the brushes; the stencil brush, powder brush, angeled eye brush, and small shader brush. I didn&#x27;t think much of it at first, thinking it was just normal shedding but as I used the brushes I noticed I had to pick brush hairs off my face. Not really ideal. I contacted Sigma and asked them if this was normal and they of course stated NO! Within a day they sent me new brushes to replace the four I had issues with. Didn&#x27;t even ask me to return the damaged ones, which was nice because i can keep them as a backup if needed. I am really impressed with how soft these brushes are and how smooth their application is. I&#x27;ve never owned super high quality brushes, just collected brushes that came in B.E. makeup sets and what not. But to me, they are a great starter set for someone that needed new brushes but didn&#x27;t want to spend $400 collecting MAC brushes. And I love the purple color. It&#x27;s fantastic. Now I won&#x27;t mix up my brushes with my roommates.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of Sigma brushes and I LOVE them.  The various brush types are really great in helping you create all sorts of different effects with your makeup.  Even if you&#x27;re not a professional makeup artist, these brushes are well worth the money and should last you a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I have with these brushes is that even though I&#x27;ve thoroughly washed them multiple times, the large powder brush (E30) and the duo fibre (E50) continue to shed.  But they do still work their magic.</li>
    <li> First I was going to get some MAC brushes for my wife, but after doing some research I heard about Sigma. I decided to go with these set because the good price and quality range. My wife loves the set, she is very happy with the quality and I am happy as well as I saved money for good quality brushes.  The shipping was very quick, it only took a week to get here to Canada.    I surely recommend them to anyone who wants great quality for less money.   Thank you Sigma.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she LOVED them....I will be purchasing more Sigma in the future....the color was Beautiful</li>
    <li> ive been always wanted this make up brushes set i am really glad i bought it bcoz it was on my (need to buy list) forever.. love it although not using all the brushes but i am happy i got the full set :)</li>
    <li> I love them all, I use all of them almost daily, I&#x27;ve been slowly adding to my collection as sigma brushes just have and amazing quality! Can&#x27;t say anything bad about these brushes.</li>
    <li> Then this is it. These brushes are soft as heck. I mean like super soft. Honestly, I know they are of good quality but they&#x27;re just so damn soft in my opinion...to the point that I rather use synthetic brushes..although I suppose that the softer they are the better it is for you face. Do they do what brushes need to do though, yes? That&#x27;s all I can give you since I personally don&#x27;t like them all that much so I hardly use them.</li>
    <li> The perfect present for this particular teenager!  She&lt;br /&gt;loves it, and uses it every day, even she isn&#x27;t going to school&lt;br /&gt;or out somewhere!</li>
    <li> I was a little exceptional about this set of brushes. I know good brush are expensive if you buy them separate.&lt;br /&gt;This kit wasn&#x27;t cheap but not that expensive as I imagined. I received it this week and they proved me wrong, the quality is excellent and they blend very well with any powder. I recommend this kit.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a full set of makeup brushes to replace old ones as well as acquire new types of brushes. With 12 brushes in the set I have all the brushes I&#x27;ll need to do all my face and eye makeup. The brushes are really soft and have the right bristle density to lay down color smoothly. I like that the set has a variety of natural and synthetic bristles so I can use the best material for the application I need. So far, I think these are better than some of my pricier brushes! The case is sturdy and splits apart to become two counter top cups so you can fit any other brushes you already have into the cups. This is a great set for a beginner or a pro.</li>
    <li> Where can I buy just the brush to the left of the big brush in the middle? The brush with the white top. I been looking everywhere for it.</li>
    <li> This set is great quality I will never try any other. U can compare these brushes to MAC brushes. They blend very well and the r extremely soft!</li>
    <li> I place my order on late Thursday night and they arrived Monday!!!! This is my first set of Sigma brushes and I&#x27;m in love already. They are extremely soft with little to no fall out!!!</li>
    <li> I think that these brushes have great quality. They are super soft and dense. If I had one complaint i would say that some of the eye brushes are a little large. Over all I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my wife for Christmas.  The shipping was faster than expected, so I actually had something to put under the tree.  I have not used the brushes personally, but my wife loves them is very happy with the quality and softness.  She loves the brush holder. It is cute and durable.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing! They pickup the face products well and go on well on the skin. I recommend them to everyone!</li>
    <li> The order arrived on schedule and the brushes are great.  My wife told me that you definetly have a different result on your make up when you use them.  She became a fan of Sigma products.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, llego en excelentes condiciones, lo recomiendo al 100%. Vendedor Excelente y serio. Saludos y que dios los bendiga</li>
    <li> sigma brushes are very good for make up artists and also for girls that just began because the quality is really good.</li>
    <li> It is the same product depict in the pictures. It is qualified and it is beautiful. I am happy with Sigma Essential Kit.</li>
    <li> This exceeded my expectations. I liked it so much I ordered the sigma precision eye kit two days later. These brushes are so dense and they pack on so much pigment with ease. Not to mention the purple on the handles are beautiful.</li>
    <li> This set was a gift from my wishlist and well worth the money he spent :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these brushes are fantastic and really give me a much better overall application of my makeup. My favorite brush is probably the angled blush brush (all white) or the duo fiber brush. I also love the case they come in because it&#x27;s critical for brushes to be properly stored, including kept in the plastic sleeves so they don&#x27;t lose their shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that if you decide to spend this kind of money on brushes, you need to take care of them. After a few uses my brushes will look dirty and feel grimy because I used a liquid foundation. If I don&#x27;t wash them regularly it can make my face break out. So yeah, take care of your brushes.</li>
    <li> Love my new makeup brush set, especially the purple color option. The package came way before the estimated shipping time and the product included instructions on how to clean the makeup brushes. I recommend highly!</li>
    <li> They are very nice brushes. Does great jobs. But still need a few more. will buy from Sigma again soon.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. The case is not space friendly. Although the brushes are good quality, I&#x27;m not sure they are worth the price but I cannot tell a difference between them and my real technique brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I also wish the purple color was more vibrant - it&#x27;s pretty dark.</li>
