<li> but I got mind in white instead of pink.</li>
<li> And, delivery was long.</li>
<li> I like it, but a little too big for me.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not very well made, but you&#x27;re not paying for heirloom jewelry, either.  </li>

<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> No where near as pretty as in the picture. Very cheap looking, I was disappointed and have a hard time bringing myself to wear it. In fact, I&#x27;ve worn it only once in a heartbeat!</li>
    <li> Pretty necklace but I wish the gold color was more subdued or, alternately, perhaps use a silver color for the metal accents</li>
    <li> I knew paying less money I would have problems with it but man is really cheap so far out of all the necklaces I bright from amazon this is the only bad one</li>

    <li> Very nice for the price, but little heavy.</li>
    <li> For the price is not bad, but is not the color shown. It is beige/off-white, not pink. And, delivery was long. I suggest not to buy if you need it like yesterday.</li>
    <li> This is extremely cheap appearing. Should have known better. You get what you pay for. And since this came from China no way to return it.</li>
    <li> Looks pretty, but made cheap. It will probably break the first 10 minutes I have it on.</li>
    <li> This necklace has the vintage look of 1928 jewelry.  I have some 1928 flower earrings that look terrific with it.  The length is adjustable from choker to about 20 inches.  If you have an extender or a thin gold lobster claw clasp bracelet, you could even make it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The front of the necklace definitely looks better than the double rows of pearls--they&#x27;re kind of chep looking, but that won&#x27;t matter if you have collar length or below hair, or are wearing this to fill in a neckline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very well made, but you&#x27;re not paying for heirloom jewelry, either.  It&#x27;s a great, vintage look for not much money.  It took a while to arrive, but I expected that.  My necklace arrived intact, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>

    <li> It was ok. Looks little cheap but I really like it</li>

    <li> Met my expectations and I was very pleased with the product, at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL.  GOOD QUALITY AND WORKMANSHIP.  WILL ORDER MORE FROM THIS COMPANY</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made. There were stones missing. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very dainty and elegant necklace! Have already received several compliments on it.</li>
    <li> Got it in time. Not very heavy. Pretty. Long enough. Looks good. Love it.for me not for a gift ( too inexpensive feeling for a gift ).</li>
    <li> This reminds me of something my grandmother would wear  it&#x27;s light weight and vintage looking  my grandmother dressed nice it&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recall getting this item?</li>
    <li> Very nice, especially for the price.  One flaw -- a slight crookedness to some of the metalwork of one &amp;#34;flower.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These necklaces are adorable and are going to look great on my bridesmaids!  For the price I was very surprised with the weight.  I ordered 7 necklaces and one did come missing two pearls,  but the customer service was fabulous! They sent me a new one right away without having to worry about the hassle of returning the broken one! For the price I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately it was a piece of junk...I even threw it away. Some of The decorative pieces were assembled backwards, the metal parts were bent.</li>
    <li> So elegant I cannot wait for my sister to wear it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it it looks great it&#x27;s so nice, you can go wrong with a price</li>
    <li> it just looks good. Broke within one day. Utter wastage of money.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful for the price, by the price so cheap I thought it would look kiddy but it&#x27;s very elegant for the price.</li>
    <li> I piece of the large petal had fallen off before I even opened the package.</li>
    <li> This product is junk not as pictured</li>
    <li> I like it but is not great quality.</li>
    <li> Stunning piece. I really love it.</li>
    <li> Good looking. worth the money</li>
    <li> Very finely made.  My wife loves it so much!</li>
    <li> I like it, but a little too big for me. It&#x27;s exactly as shown.</li>
    <li> Just received it in the mail and look forward to wearing it with summer outfits. it is very delicate and light to dress up an outfit in the hot, humid weather of the south. Love it already.</li>
    <li> Love this style of it but I didn&#x27;t like how the two chains of pearls looked so I took a chain off and got much more compliments than with the double layered chain</li>
