      <li>Smells good, moisturizing and leave skin feeling nice.</li>
      <li>I gave it 3 stars because although I think its great in keeping the skin silky, smooth and feeling moist, it doesn&#x27;t get you as brown as it claims.  </li>
      <li>I agree the smell is amazing</li>
      <li>Plus it leaves my skin silky smooth and smelling great.  </li>
      <li>It has a truly amazing scent and it glides onto my skin like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>, Haute Couture is AMAZING through and through.</li>
      <li>I have tried too many lotions to count and none of them have worked as good as Haute Couture.</li>
      <li>it smells excellent and leaves your skin so soft and smooth and has so many good ingredients in it for your body to help with the damage we do to our skin from tanning</li>
      <li>It is fairly priced and is worth the money!</li>
      <li>The smell is OK more of a mans musk but still nice ..&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
      <li>Love this lotion Have used it before and switch up</li>
      <li>but i love tanning :)</li>
      <li>I Love this lotion.</li>
      <li>Not only does it help make my tan even more bronze, but it makes my skin smell great!</li>
      <li>I am so in love with this lotion-</li>
      <li>Ty and love it.</li>
      <li>For me - Im older, so it was the perfect lotion for a 40 something years olds skin, when one should no longer be tanning anyway ;)</li>
      <li>and I am super excited to see that I don&#x27;t have to purchase it at my salon for $75 anymore!!</li>
      <li>Found this at a salon in Dublin Ireland and loved it so much I searched for it when I returned to the states.</li>
      <li>was easily applied.  </li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and it takes a while for me to get a nice tan, but this lotion seemed to speed up the process and I love the deep golden brown color I have achieved in just a couple of weeks.  </li>
      <li>This is the best product I have used and half the price of the lotions sold at my tanning salon.  </li>
      <li>Really gives a nice tan.</li>
      <li>and it does leave your skin smooth..</li>
      <li>and i might add, that after going tanning with this product, my boyfriend always comes up to me and says im so soft and smell so good</li>
      <li>Not many lotions will help me tan, but this one works great!</li>
      <li>This product has a fresh fragrance even after tanning!</li>
      <li>I have been around the block with tanning lotions, and by far- Haute Couture is my favorite!</li>
      <li>It feels very silky, just wish it smelled better.</li>
      <li>I felt instantly tanner walking out of the tanning bed and would recommend it to anyone that may be in need of a good tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
      <li>this is my absolute favorite.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell as much, but the lotion does</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t leave the tanning salon smelling like \\&quot;burnt skin\\&quot;- actually when I got home after my first time using it, my boyfriend said that I smelled amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>Received super fast!</li>
      <li>really its worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I ordered this product online because I had always seen it at my tanning salon but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $85.00 to try it out.  </li>
      <li>This is definitely one of my favorite tanning lotions.  </li>
      <li>I have had more compliments on how good I smell when I use my lotion, than any expensive perfume I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job and the silicon dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
      <li>It did not give me a dark tan, but a nice glow.</li>
      <li>Fast ship.</li>
      <li>It is also very moisturizing, and smooths into my skin evenly.</li>
      <li>spend that much.</li>
      <li>but I absolutely would purchase again.</li>
      <li>As long as it&#x27;s available on Amazon I will continue to buy it.</li>
      <li>Which if you tan, is usually not a word used to describe the way you smell afterward!</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I found it on amazon for much cheaper</li>
      <li>My skin feels super soft after, and I definitely have a noticeable blush to my skin without having used a tingle.</li>
      <li>So i have been tanning on and off for about 3 years, these past 6 mnths i have been tanning a lot more.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so silky soft.</li>
      <li>It actually goes on smoother and covers more area than my other lotions did, I always leave the tanning salon smelling fresh for the rest of the day instead of that dead \\&quot;melatonin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also nice to know while the other tanners are spending $85+ for this lotion I can get it on Amazon for much less!</li>

<li> I have a very nice base tan.</li>
<li> I am one of the people that naturaly has really fair skin, first few tans i burn, then get pale again, then after about 8 sessions i start getting a base.</li>
<li> It has very minimal bronzer in</li>
<li> I decided to try this based on the previous reviews.</li>
<li> I know it is for tanning, but I use it everyday as a skin softener.</li>
<li> When it came in the box I was extremely nervous about the smell even if it was in a pretty bottle it could have a horrible smell that would totally dampen my tanning.  </li>
<li> I have been using Haute Couture for at least six years now.</li>
<li> But not a great tanner..  </li>
<li> then once i get the base i have a hard time getting any darker.</li>

    <li> Really gives a nice tan.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product online because I had always seen it at my tanning salon but wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the $85.00 to try it out.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found it on amazon for much cheaper, I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  When it came in the box I was extremely nervous about the smell even if it was in a pretty bottle it could have a horrible smell that would totally dampen my tanning.  I&#x27;m happy to say that it smells really good and it wasn&#x27;t as greasy as some tanning lotions can be a was easily applied.  I felt instantly tanner walking out of the tanning bed and would recommend it to anyone that may be in need of a good tanning lotion that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune.</li>
    <li> I am fair skinned and have freckles. Not many lotions will help me tan, but this one works great! It is fairly priced and is worth the money!</li>

I am one of the people that naturaly has really fair skin, first few tans i burn, then get pale again, then after about 8 sessions i start getting a base. then once i get the base i have a hard time getting any darker. I have tried too many lotions to count and none of them have worked as good as Haute Couture. after 3 visits i was darker then i have ever been! once the bottle was gone i was incredibly darker, i had people walking up to me saying they were jealous of my tan. no one ever said that when i tanned before i used this lotion. really its worth every penny! and i might add, that after going tanning with this product, my boyfriend always comes up to me and says im so soft and smell so good, Haute Couture is AMAZING through and through. BUY IT!!</li>

    <li> Great price! Great product! Received super fast! Thank you !</li>

    <li> Ty and love it. Excellent Seller! Fast ship.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this lotion on Amazon. It costs $75.00 at my tanning salon and I was considering going without rather than spend that much. I don&#x27;t love the smell as much, but the lotion does it&#x27;s job and the silicon dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft. As long as it&#x27;s available on Amazon I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance; silicone softens and stays on the skin for a longer time.  I have used this product over a year, both for tanning and for moisturizing after shower and it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have been using Haute Couture for at least six years now. I know it is for tanning, but I use it everyday as a skin softener. It makes my skin feel so silky soft. Also I don&#x27;t have to buy perfume because the scent is awesome. I have had more compliments on how good I smell when I use my lotion, than any expensive perfume I have ever bought. I hope I never run out of it.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have used and half the price of the lotions sold at my tanning salon.  I am fair skinned and it takes a while for me to get a nice tan, but this lotion seemed to speed up the process and I love the deep golden brown color I have achieved in just a couple of weeks.  Plus it leaves my skin silky smooth and smelling great.  I definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I Love this lotion. Not only does it help make my tan even more bronze, but it makes my skin smell great!</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion because of the silicone, it was just an added bonus that it came with the aromatherapy option.  It smells awesome &amp; doesnt leave you smelling like burnt skin after tanning.  I gave it 3 stars because although I think its great in keeping the skin silky, smooth and feeling moist, it doesn&#x27;t get you as brown as it claims.  For me - Im older, so it was the perfect lotion for a 40 something years olds skin, when one should no longer be tanning anyway ;)</li>
    <li> I have been tanning on and off for 16 years and of all the money &amp; time I have put into tanning lotions this is my absolute favorite.  It actually goes on smoother and covers more area than my other lotions did, I always leave the tanning salon smelling fresh for the rest of the day instead of that dead \\&quot;melatonin stink\\&quot; lol. It&#x27;s also nice to know while the other tanners are spending $85+ for this lotion I can get it on Amazon for much less!</li>
    <li> I read all the comments on this before I bought.  I agree the smell is amazing but I am not trying to buy a perfume.  I had no added color after tanning and I have been for years.  It was as if I didn&#x27;t use anything, but smelt great afterwards.  I am returning this.</li>
    <li> Works as well as any and smells great</li>
    <li> I have been around the block with tanning lotions, and by far- Haute Couture is my favorite! It has a truly amazing scent and it glides onto my skin like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used. I don&#x27;t leave the tanning salon smelling like \\&quot;burnt skin\\&quot;- actually when I got home after my first time using it, my boyfriend said that I smelled amazing!

I am so in love with this lotion- and I am super excited to see that I don&#x27;t have to purchase it at my salon for $75 anymore!!</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of my favorite tanning lotions.  It acts as a bronzer and a tingle without the bronze color or tingle effect.  It gives you great color and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but I absolutely would purchase again. I have used it three times now and already have a tan. It feels very silky, just wish it smelled better.</li>
    <li> I had been tanning twice a week for the last month and ran out of my prev. lotion. So when I started to use this lotion keep in mind I have a very nice base tan. I decided to try this based on the previous reviews. The smell is OK more of a mans musk but still nice ..&lt;br /&gt;However, I haven&#x27;t seen that I have gotten any darker by any means.. It has very minimal bronzer in it.&lt;br /&gt;But yes it smells good and it does leave your skin smooth.. But not a great tanner..  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
    <li> This product has a fresh fragrance even after tanning! It did not give me a dark tan, but a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion Have used it before and switch up so my body uses different lotions and I like to use a bronzer lotion once in awhile but I always come back to this 1 it smells excellent and leaves your skin so soft and smooth and has so many good ingredients in it for your body to help with the damage we do to our skin from tanning but i love tanning :) This does not have bronzer in it if your looking for a bronzer and it is good when you want to increase and speed up the tan you have it gives me a great tan in the level 3 beds :) This is top notch lotion!!!</li>
