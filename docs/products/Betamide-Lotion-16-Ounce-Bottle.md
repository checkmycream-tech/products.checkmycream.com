<li> No dry cracking or build up of dry skin!  </li>
<li> He applies it several times a week to his feet and skin that is considerably dry.</li>
<li> This is the only product that effects &amp; helps my extremely dry skin.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s the ONLY lotion that has EVER worked on my hubby&#x27;s dry, itchy legs in the winter.  </li>
<li> It stays on, smooths rough feet in a very short time.  </li>
<li> but it also goes a long way</li>

<li> My husband has diabetes, his feet become dry and irritated, therefor his specialist asked to try the lotion.</li>
<li> This lotion contains ingredients that soften dry, scaly skin and stop itching.</li>
<li> anyway, i did not really notice a huge difference, although i did not keep continuing to use it since it is a bit expensive for lotion</li>
<li> I recommend Betamide Lotion to anyone that has dry skin anywhere on their body.</li>
<li> My skin doesn&#x27;t seem as thin and fragile as it normally does at this time of year.  </li>
<li> In addition to that, it&#x27;s been a rough winter in the Midwest.  </li>
<li> The last time I tried to order a bottle, I was informed that it was not available.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure the supply is low or it has been taken off the shelf.  </li>
<li> Sometimes I add a little baby oil, when the weather is extremely dry (winter overheated rooms) and that seems to do the trick.    </li>
<li> I have those little bumps on my upper arms from time to time and Betamide gets rid of them in just a few days.  </li>
<li> Added up, it has resulted in dried, rough hands with tattered cuticles.  </li>
<li> Keratosis Pilaris (or those bumps on the back of about 40% of the population&#x27;s arms) is an incredibly common condition, but there are very little treatments for it.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed because the reviews indicate this product has been very helpful to some people with this or similar conditions.</li>
<li> I WASTED MY MONEY.</li>
<li> He has been using this product on his hands and feet for a few days.  </li>
<li> His hands are assaulted by harsh solvents at work and then he washes them with something equivalent to sandpaper.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure I should start up again.</li>
<li> In my opinion, there is no better product for diabetic foot care.  </li>
<li> It is not oily or sticky and lasts at least 12 hours.  </li>
<li> In fact, it seemed to make the bumps worse.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very thick and soothing, unlike the Betamide Lotion, which is very thin and, for me at least, actually irritating.</li>
<li> you suffer from random bumps on your arms or thighs, I recommend giving this product a try.  </li>
<li> Living in Germany, I find it difficult to purchase this product.</li>
<li> SORRY</li>
<li> An expensive experiment.</li>
<li> i had read that this lotion would help reduce the appreace of what some call \\&quot;chicken bumps on your skin\\</li>
<li> The scent is very vague and unnoticeable unless you deliberately bring your hands to your nose and intentionally take a smell.  </li>
<li> It is like a wonder cream on my children&#x27;s faces who have really bad</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This lotion contains ingredients that soften dry, scaly skin and stop itching. It is dermatologist recommended. It works well for me.</li>
    <li> I have had lentigos (age spots) on my thighs and calves for more than 20 years. These often got irritated and became sores. I have no idea what caused these. Doctors always assume sun damage, but they started when I was only 35. Nothing has ever helped these before. I have tried many moisturizers.    My current skin doctor prescribed betamide lotion. I finally started using it on a daily basis, since occasional use had cured the tendency towards sores. Now, after just a month of daily use and scrubbing the skin in the shower, the spots have faded most of the way gone and my skin looks 20 years younger.     I could not be more pleased with this lotions ability to renew my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had severe dryskin on my lag,arms and feet for years. The second time I applied Betamide lotion the itching and  the flaking of my skin went away. Even though the dry skin on my feet has not completely gone away there has been a 10 fold improvement.  I recommend Betamide Lotion to anyone that has dry skin anywhere on their body.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00068Y9VM Betamide Lotion, 16 Ounce Bottle]]    When I was visiting in the States, my dermatologist recommended this product to me and gave me a free sample. As a diabetic, I frequently suffer from dry skin. This product is amazing and keeps my skin from drying out. I apply it liberally after bathing, and I am quite satisfied. Living in Germany, I find it difficult to purchase this product. Thank goodness it is available at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a year and I find it to be the very best lotion for preventing dryness and resulting rash.</li>
    <li> I am a cancer patient, and my chemotherapy has an extremely drying effect on every part of my body - not only is my skin so dry that I can knock off flakes of skin from my stomach like snow - but also my hair is dry and lifeless.  While Betamide can&#x27;t help my hair, of course, it does an excellent job of moisturizing my skin and softening it so that it stays feeling good for most of the day.  In my case, that is an outstanding feat!  It had been recommended by my dermatologist.</li>

    <li> Betamide is the best lotion for dry skin that I have ever used!  It has worked miracles on my feet.  My heels are like new!  No dry cracking or build up of dry skin!  The name of the product should be NEW FEET!</li>
    <li> Keratosis Pilaris (or those bumps on the back of about 40% of the population&#x27;s arms) is an incredibly common condition, but there are very little treatments for it.  Microdermabrasion can help temporarily, but it is expensive and most be done often.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product really helps to keep the bumps under control.  I can even shave my legs with it! (Quite a feat at times).  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from random bumps on your arms or thighs, I recommend giving this product a try.  It&#x27;s completely worth the price.</li>
    <li> An over the counter item not carried in many stores.  I found just ordering it and paying the delivery charges was easier and cheaper than driving all over town looking for it.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by our dermatologists!  It&#x27;s the ONLY lotion that has EVER worked on my hubby&#x27;s dry, itchy legs in the winter.  Sticky when first applied but that doesn&#x27;t last too long. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is the only product that effects &amp; helps my extremely dry skin.  I could not find it locally, and was THRILLED when I found it on Amazon!!</li>
    <li> I have bumps on my thighs and the back of my arms that nothing has cured, including Betamide Lotion. In fact, it seemed to make the bumps worse. The bottle says to discontinue for a while if irritation occurs, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve done. I&#x27;m not sure I should start up again. I was disappointed because the reviews indicate this product has been very helpful to some people with this or similar conditions. I had high hopes. But for whatever reason, I saw no improvement at all. The directions said to apply up to 4x daily. An expensive experiment. I&#x27;m now using Aveeno Intense Relief Repair Cream before bed, which seems to work much better. It&#x27;s very thick and soothing, unlike the Betamide Lotion, which is very thin and, for me at least, actually irritating.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome lotion for all parts of your body!  It is not oily or sticky and lasts at least 12 hours.  It has a pleasant smell too.  My Dermatologist recommended it for my blotchy facial complextion and for eczema.  I highly recommend this product and even though it sounds a bit pricey it is not only worth it but it also goes a long way and it really works wonders.  I give it a 10/10.</li>
    <li> This wonderful otc lotion is available at the pharmacy counter of most drugstores if you ask.  It is like a wonder cream on my children&#x27;s faces who have really bad k.p.  It really clears it up fast better than any prescription ever tried.  Also great for eczema.  This is a great lotion.  My pediatrician told me about it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema and her skin is sensitive.  The lotion has too much fragrance.  It smelt as if my daughter pured a bottle of perfume over her body.  I have been using natural oils,lotions and soaps I have purchased from the health food store.  They seem to be doing a good job.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended for my husband.  He is a tool and die maker.  His hands are assaulted by harsh solvents at work and then he washes them with something equivalent to sandpaper.  In addition to that, it&#x27;s been a rough winter in the Midwest.  Added up, it has resulted in dried, rough hands with tattered cuticles.  He has been using this product on his hands and feet for a few days.  He is noticing improvement.    I decided to give it a try, even though I don&#x27;t experience chronic skin problems.  This stuff works!  My hands look and feel well hydrated.  My skin doesn&#x27;t seem as thin and fragile as it normally does at this time of year.  My hands look younger!  I use it once a day before bed.    The light fragrance reminds me of almond with a tiny hint of vanilla.  The scent is very vague and unnoticeable unless you deliberately bring your hands to your nose and intentionally take a smell.  The viscosity was more liquid than I imagined. However, the skin absorbs it quickly and no filmy, tacky or oily residue is left behind.    It works better than L&#x27;Occitane or Aveeno.</li>
    <li> i bought this product by recomendation from my husband&#x27;s doctor. My husband has diabetes, his feet become dry and irritated, therefor his specialist asked to try the lotion. He applies it several times a week to his feet and skin that is considerably dry. Thank you for the swift action in shipping.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, there is no better product for diabetic foot care.  My physician was even impressed with the results from treating dry heal cracks.</li>
    <li> I have those little bumps on my upper arms from time to time and Betamide gets rid of them in just a few days.  Also this is a great foot lotion.  It stays on, smooths rough feet in a very short time.  Amazon sells out of this product, so buy it while you can.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT ABOUT 45 DAYS.  I SEE NO CHANGE IN MY SKIN. THE LOTION IS VERY STICKY.  IT WAS RECOMENDED BY MY DERMATOLIGIST.  SORRY I WASTED MY MONEY.</li>
    <li> Betamide is an excellent lotion for dry, blemished skin.  It was recommended by my dermatologist and I used it regularly.  The last time I tried to order a bottle, I was informed that it was not available.  I&#x27;m not sure the supply is low or it has been taken off the shelf.  Maybe someone who knows more than I do can tell me</li>
    <li> I have had skin problems for years, that no doctor was able to treat effectively.  I just got used to people staring at my arms and legs, covered in pumps and scabs from my constant scratching.  Then I tried Betamide, WOW!  My skin is now virtually bump and scab free. I don&#x27;t itch anymore.  If you have folliculitis or a similar conditon try this lotion!!!</li>
    <li> As a person with fair, dry skin, I can&#x27;t say enough good about this lotion.  It has urea, plus great moisturizers and makes my skin feel soft and supple.  Sometimes I add a little baby oil, when the weather is extremely dry (winter overheated rooms) and that seems to do the trick.    This lotion lasts a long time and is well worth the money.[[ASIN:B00068Y9VM Betamide Lotion, 16 Ounce Bottle]]</li>
    <li> It is really good for my dry skin. Attention Amazon: please bring back the betamide lotion in here coz I really need it. No other urea lotion can replace betamide lotion on my skin.</li>
    <li> My cracked heels are completely healed.  I admit, it works best when I use my pumice stone (after a shower) and then use the lotion.  I did this twice a day (only used the pumice stone twice a week)and saw results in just one week.  I use the lotion every morning after my shower and sometimes use at night as well.  I live in flip flops, so I need all the help I can get and THIS is IT!!!</li>
