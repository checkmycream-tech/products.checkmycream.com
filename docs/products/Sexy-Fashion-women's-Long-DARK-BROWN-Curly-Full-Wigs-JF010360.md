      <li>Its very much like the picture and feels like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>

<li> /&gt;Purchase is long .....</li>
<li> but thats to be expected since its not real human hair.</li>
<li> the only thing is that mine is so dark brown</li>
<li> My only complaint would be the color but definitely</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very long hair wig and  dark brown/reddish color.  </li>

<li> I ordered the dark brown wig for a costume I&#x27;m wearing and when I received it, I couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed.</li>

<li> it is just an average wig.</li>

<li> There is also little shedding.</li>
<li> Not an everyday type wig.</li>
<li> At first sight i hated the reddish color, but started liking it later.</li>

    <li> to my surprise all the wigs i got were wrong i oredered real human hair wigs and i got sythetic hair wigs</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good wig the only thing is that mine is so dark brown it looks black (or it is black) but other than that its good</li>
    <li> This wig was red not Dark Brown but very pretty &amp; well worth the price. My only complaint would be the color but definitely well worth the money</li>
    <li> This wig can be worn for any occasion.  However I found it to be extremely large for my head even when I use the inside clip.  It had no combs attached.  I have since done a makeshift with it and it works perfectly for me.  I would recommend to persons with head circumference of over 21&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I ordered the dark brown wig for a costume I&#x27;m wearing and when I received it, I couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed. Instead of a chestnut brown, I got an AUBURN RED wig! DO NOT BUY unless you don&#x27;t care what color wig you get.</li>
    <li> My wig arrived today nearly two weeks or more earlier than expected. It&#x27;s a very long hair wig and  dark brown/reddish color.  The bangs are shorter than the picture but it&#x27;s a fun wig. I like it . It&#x27;s a new look for me. But a nice enough quality to wear to parties or going out to dinner. Not an everyday type wig. For the price...I like it ...a lot.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like anything in the picture / they sent me an orangish color when I order brown. Not impressed!</li>
    <li> Hair is red, and doesn&#x27;t look real!</li>
    <li> I recieved it just about an hour ago. Its very much like the picture and feels like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-very good quality for a cheap wig, is thick and feels like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-gets tangled very easily and ull havta keep brushing it (trying to get a detangler to help it). It also has that &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; smell to it but thats to be expected since its not real human hair. The hair net that came with it is good to use for about 30m then u need to fix it again. (I suggest bying a hair net seperatly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great quality wig for something so cheap. I gave it a four only because of the cons. Theres always room for improvement. ^^</li>
    <li> Looks very good , on will order again , price was good it came in a timely manner . I love the way i can wear it  in an updo style.as of 2/7/14 going over my reviews this is not the wig i purchase the photo is wrong the wig i&lt;br /&gt;Purchase is long .....whats up with this picture of the deceitfulness...</li>
    <li> Item was okay…However, it took awhile to arrive and when it did I had to let it air out because it had a strong odor (which could of been the chemicals that was used in its construction).</li>
    <li> Pros- great length. Can be cut to length desired.&lt;br /&gt;  -great color. Its more of a dark reddish brown&lt;br /&gt;  - good body and feels  real.&lt;br /&gt;  - can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality you get. Its not perfect but its better then the holloween wigs.&lt;br /&gt;Cons- took a month to get&lt;br /&gt;  - sheds a lot when combed. Like normal hair.&lt;br /&gt;  - free cap sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig is great. It did take a month to get it but to me that wasn&#x27;t a big deal. It deals and looks real. I have pcos and I have lost a lot of hair cause of it. This made me feel better about me. I don&#x27;t lie I tell people its a wig all the time. Usually they compliment me on how pretty my hair is. They seamed shock most of the times.</li>
    <li> She liked the style of the wig and how very natural it felt.  Was a good fit and looks very natural.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t as curly/wavy is was shown on the website.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy cheap quality</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compiments while wearing this at a con and no one realized that it was a wig, that&#x27;s how natural it looked. There is also little shedding. However there was one serious draw back. This wig gets tangled so easily, I&#x27;ve tried brushing it out with a wig comb and I&#x27;ve even tried washing it. Nothing helps.  But for the price I paid this wig it is very nice and I even got a free gift with it.</li>
    <li> Like other people have said, the dark brown is NOT BROWN at all.  It&#x27;s a coppery auburn.  (Think Black Widow hair in the Avengers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the color being really off, it&#x27;s decent quality for it&#x27;s price point.  the wig doesn&#x27;t frizz much, and it&#x27;s thick and the curls hold nicely.  My order came with a wig cap, which is a nice bonus.</li>
    <li> Its like a costume wig. My fiance does not care for it. Sorry</li>
    <li> I wore this wig to a party and my friends almost didn&#x27;t recognize me and others had no idea it was a wig!  It was beautiful! I was able to brush it very gently. It also looked very natural. It even came with a stocking for my own long hair and a cute pair of hot pink socks. Bonus :)&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase, highly recommend</li>
    <li> The price was so low that I wasn&#x27;t expecting quality. I was so surprised when it arrived. Very pretty, soft, shiny. I had gotten it for a skit with my Mardi Gras Krewe. It was perfect. I had no issues with the fit, it fit well and stayed in place.</li>
    <li> At first sight i hated the reddish color, but started liking it later. A lot of people like ot on me and usually think that it is my hair. One seriously negative side to this wig is that it starts tangling even by the first day use...it is just an average wig.</li>
    <li> I loved the color.  It looked really nice on. However, it had a lot of rough edges and felt thin.  Still, I like the style and fit.</li>
    <li> the reason why i give it one star not because of the quality or color. tho the color is more into nutmeg red brown that was not the issue its cuz its too small for people with a big head lol yes mayb my head is over size but this wig didnt even fit my 13 year old either an she has an average head but it fit my 6 year old. maybe it just has to be size a bit bigger</li>
