      <li>The guides are OK, they fit fine (some pushing required).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Lightweight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>so if what you need is a hair clippers that will do a reasonable job day in and day out, this kit will do nicely.</li>
      <li>I AM ALSO HAPPY WITH---ITS THE ONLY THING IN THE KIT</li>
      <li>Bought this , not to cut hair, but to just get a clean sideburns</li>
      <li>It has certainly paid for itself many times over in my house.</li>
      <li>It is quiet and works good.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to hold, and the right amount of accessories.  </li>
      <li>Extraordinary haircut kit for the price.</li>
      <li>Now, I can quickly cut his hair in about 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>The main gripe I have with it is that the &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; is cheaply put on and it comes off easily.</li>
      <li>others reviews are pretty accurate for what u should expect from this buzzer.</li>
      <li>for itself the very first cut.</li>
      <li>So this new one is exactly the same and works just as good as the first.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My 12 year old cuts my husband&#x27;s hair with it and it works well and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>I only wish it came with more guide combs.  </li>
      <li>This, however, is better than others I tried recently.</li>
      <li>This kit replaces a similar unit I had for many years.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted and need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first one cost me .0095 cents a day or .28 cents a</li>
      <li>says it has a new powerful motor, I plugged it in and turned it on</li>
      <li>The clippers work really well</li>
      <li>it was fast and excatley what I wanted.</li>
      <li>We&#x27;ve used it about 30 times since buying it, and it&#x27;s holding up very well.</li>
      <li>cant really beat the price.</li>
      <li>If the chrome was actual metal instead of cheap plastic, I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with maintaining it.</li>
      <li>A real bargain, have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>It cuts hair very well, so it fits its purpose.</li>
      <li>you oil and clean these as recommended they will last years.</li>
      <li>Works geat, great price and everything I expected, the only thing It did not have is the cd however it was not a big deal!</li>
      <li>Overall, not bad at all for the price.</li>
      <li>I cannot calculate all the thousands of dollars I have saved by cutting my own hair most of the time.  </li>
      <li>they are very easy to use and have worked well for the past 2 or 3months</li>
      <li>Quiet and works like a charm with its powerful motor.  </li>
      <li>The combs off the other clippers don&#x27;t fit</li>
      <li>I watched a how to video on youtube and am now great at hair cutting.</li>
      <li>Gives a professional cut every time.</li>
      <li>only negative for this kit it that the handle can get pretty warm if you&#x27;re using it for a long time, which shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you&#x27;re doing 1 haircut.</li>
      <li>Works really well, and comes with everything you could possibly need</li>
      <li>the guides/guards seem flimsy - we are keeping the old guards to use.</li>
      <li>We had to stop a couple of times and let the unit cool down.</li>
      <li>The storage case is not an organizer, it is pretty hard to fit things back in.  </li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;ll cut, but you&#x27;ll be there for at least 30 minutes trying to get everything, and you&#x27;ll likely still miss some.  </li>
      <li>It cleans off pretty easily and it isn&#x27;t that difficult to pluck the hair out of it.</li>
      <li>It makes cutting quick and easy.</li>
      <li>Might take a bit longer to cut the hair since it&#x27;s smaller, but I&#x27;d say probably only about 5 minutes longer than the normal say about 30 minutes for me</li>
      <li>It certainly paid for itself, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long.</li>
      <li>Well it was one of the cheapest sets at the store, and ultimately you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;After about a year of pretty frequent use, a small wire part broke.</li>
      <li>The first one was a Conair I think and was a little bigger than this one and cost about $20 at walmart.</li>
      <li>Much cheaper and lighter than our previous trimmer.</li>
      <li>Gets a little hot when used for a long time.</li>

<li> Much cheaper and lighter than our previous trimmer.</li>
<li> Gets a little hot when used for a long time.</li>
<li> My wife has been cutting our 3 sons and my hair for the last 36 years and we have gone through many clippers in that time.  </li>
<li> I started cutting my boyfriends hair with these and just love them.</li>
<li> I only spent $10.00 on sale and now use it as a paperweight.</li>
<li> though I do have a very large mirror about 3 feet by 2.5 feet that I hold behind my head to see how it looks.</li>
<li> This one is a little smaller than the 1st two but works about as well and costs the same (about $20).</li>
<li> These are quiet and smooth cutting.  </li>
<li> six years, I oiled the blade one single time.</li>
<li> &amp; it didnt feel at all different than a previous model I bought</li>
<li> WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST</li>
<li> Would buy other products from this company indeed.</li>
<li> It is quiet and it does not vibrate that much (at least when compared to cheaper models which use a magnetic motor).  </li>
<li> It holds the blades to the rotating motor and the whole product is now useless.</li>
<li> The new seems a bit crude and heats up more than expected hence making it painful to trim my beard.</li>
<li> (I&#x27;m a little slow - it&#x27;s hard to see the back of my head for instance</li>
<li> so he doesn&#x27;t get really shaggy, and before we bought this kit, I was cutting it with scissors, which took over 30 minutes.</li>
<li> Only made one mistake in all my years of cutting where i accidenttally forgot to put on the attachment and cut too short one time.</li>
<li> A SMALL PIECE OF PLASTIC AND LITE WEIGHT</li>
<li> I usually cut my hair 3 to 4 times a year.  </li>
<li> and I&#x27;m still paying the same amount for a hair cutting razor</li>
<li> That means I have probably saved at least $500</li>
<li> If you have even remotely thick hair, this is not the razor you want.  </li>
<li> That means I have used this cutter for approximately 12 hair cuts and it is broken.  </li>
<li> My cord finally failed.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for cutting hair for over a year without a barber</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the only set I have ever used for 6 years. My cord finally failed. So this new one is exactly the same and works just as good as the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one cost me .0095 cents a day or .28 cents a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it to trim my beard. Because razors are just a pain in the rear end. Razor burn and creams and replacing blades. This Conair is NO DRAMA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In six years, I oiled the blade one single time. No lie.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I was using one for 2 years. The new seems a bit crude and heats up more than expected hence making it painful to trim my beard.</li>
    <li> I got real good hair cut.</li>
    <li> Quiet and works like a charm with its powerful motor.  Comfortable to hold, and the right amount of accessories.  I cannot calculate all the thousands of dollars I have saved by cutting my own hair most of the time.  I go to a barber, once in a while, just to see how he thinks my hair should be cut.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 3 years ago.  I usually cut my hair 3 to 4 times a year.  That means I have used this cutter for approximately 12 hair cuts and it is broken.  Something inside the cutter rattles and the blades cannot be properly aligned anymore.  Now it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has certainly paid for itself many times over in my house. I use it to cut both my husband&#x27;s and my son&#x27;s hair. It makes cutting quick and easy. The cape is very cheap, but it has lasted for the seven months that we&#x27;ve had and used it, though it has lost one of the ties.</li>
    <li> says it has a new powerful motor, I plugged it in and turned it on &amp; it didnt feel at all different than a previous model I bought</li>
    <li> It cuts hair very well, so it fits its purpose. It is quiet and it does not vibrate that much (at least when compared to cheaper models which use a magnetic motor).  The construction is OK: &#x27;chrome-look&#x27; plastic, don&#x27;t get fooled by the metallic shine. Very light.  The guides are OK, they fit fine (some pushing required). (Throw away the &#x27;cape&#x27;...)  The storage case is not an organizer, it is pretty hard to fit things back in.  Overall, not bad at all for the price.</li>
    <li> Well it was one of the cheapest sets at the store, and ultimately you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;After about a year of pretty frequent use, a small wire part broke. It holds the blades to the rotating motor and the whole product is now useless. It certainly paid for itself, but don&#x27;t expect it to last very long. 1 star for poor build quality at critical stress point, cheap materials.</li>
    <li> Works really well, and comes with everything you could possibly need BUT it&#x27;s not all chrome, it&#x27;s mostly plastic.. Not necessarily what I was wanting but it works..</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you oil and clean these as recommended they will last years.</li>
    <li> it was fast and excatley what I wanted. thank you for being fast and making it a joy o shop online. thank you lisa.</li>
    <li> I started cutting my boyfriends hair with these and just love them. we save $15 a week now. I watched a how to video on youtube and am now great at hair cutting. they are very easy to use and have worked well for the past 2 or 3months</li>
    <li> Had an older version it was superior. This, however, is better than others I tried recently.</li>
    <li> If you have even remotely thick hair, this is not the razor you want.  Sure, it&#x27;ll cut, but you&#x27;ll be there for at least 30 minutes trying to get everything, and you&#x27;ll likely still miss some.  We&#x27;re returning it and going to buy the $10 one at Walmart that works a ton better than this.</li>
    <li> 2nd haircut using this. Wife helps me and using the clip on length blade guards it&#x27;s a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;Paid for itself the very first cut. Bye bye barber shop</li>
    <li> This is a great product. My 12 year old cuts my husband&#x27;s hair with it and it works well and is easy to use.</li>
    <li> Hope this one will last.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for cutting hair for over a year without a barber</li>
    <li> A piece of junk! Used it only to trim my buzzcut once per week. Shorted out and died within a month. Do Not Buy!</li>
    <li> has already paid for itself. definitely recommend. just in time for spring. i&#x27;ll miss my barbers. more money in my pocket, though.</li>
    <li> best item I ever bought from amazon</li>
    <li> This has worked for me. I cut my hair. I have been cutting my hair by myself for about 20 or so years now. That means I have probably saved at least $500 I imagine though this is the 3rd one of these I&#x27;ve bought. The first one was a Conair I think and was a little bigger than this one and cost about $20 at walmart. It lasted about 10 years I think. The second was a remmington and was about the same size as the 1st conair. This one is a little smaller than the 1st two but works about as well and costs the same (about $20). Considering my pay has about tripled during those 20 years and I&#x27;m still paying the same amount for a hair cutting razor, I can deal with it being a bit smaller. It still works. Might take a bit longer to cut the hair since it&#x27;s smaller, but I&#x27;d say probably only about 5 minutes longer than the normal say about 30 minutes for me (I&#x27;m a little slow - it&#x27;s hard to see the back of my head for instance though I do have a very large mirror about 3 feet by 2.5 feet that I hold behind my head to see how it looks. Only made one mistake in all my years of cutting where i accidenttally forgot to put on the attachment and cut too short one time. But it grows back anyhow so who cares.</li>
    <li> Gets a little hot when used for a long time. However, it cuts nicely and kit has everything you need. Very easy to use and a good value for the price</li>
    <li> This set of hair clippers are the best we&#x27;ve ever bought.  My wife has been cutting our 3 sons and my hair for the last 36 years and we have gone through many clippers in that time.  These are quiet and smooth cutting.  I only wish it came with more guide combs.  The largest is a 1/2&amp;#34; and we use combs up to 1 1/2&amp;#34;.  The combs off the other clippers don&#x27;t fit so you need to buy the $23 set separately.</li>
    <li> The clippers work really well however it would be nice if the cord where longer.</li>
    <li> Very quiet motor. Pre-set blade settings. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Extraordinary haircut kit for the price. Gives a professional cut every time. Would buy other products from this company indeed.</li>
    <li> Perfect set, for personal use, I have use it about three times and it&#x27;s doing great job. Maintenance required to avoid rust (Just some oil for the blades which it&#x27;s included)</li>
    <li> others reviews are pretty accurate for what u should expect from this buzzer. It is good for what i needed it for (just clean-ups) but i still pay a barber bi monthly for a haircut. cant really beat the price.</li>
    <li> WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST ----THE REVIEWS THAT WERE NEGITIVE HAD ME THINKING---- I WANTED ONE SO I TOOK A CHANCE---RECEIVED IN THE STATED TIME ----APPEARS TO BE A NICE BUY ----USED IT ONCE AND ITS A LITE WEIGHT UNIT WITH PLENTY OF POWER--- I AM WELL SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE YOU MIGHT WANT TO PURCHASE  A CAPE SEPERATELY---I DID WHICH I AM ALSO HAPPY WITH---ITS THE ONLY THING IN THE KIT I DIDN,T LIKE ---ITS A SMALL PIECE OF PLASTIC AND LITE WEIGHT</li>
    <li> Works geat, great price and everything I expected, the only thing It did not have is the cd however it was not a big deal!</li>
    <li> I like the haircutting kit</li>
    <li> This kit replaces a similar unit I had for many years. I&#x27;m not someone who spend a lot of time on my hair or haircut so if what you need is a hair clippers that will do a reasonable job day in and day out, this kit will do nicely.</li>
    <li> A real bargain, have been using it for years. It is quiet and works good.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s hair grows faster than anyone I know. It&#x27;s like one of those chia heads, except you don&#x27;t have to water it. He needs to get his hair cut every week or 2 so he doesn&#x27;t get really shaggy, and before we bought this kit, I was cutting it with scissors, which took over 30 minutes. Now, I can quickly cut his hair in about 10 minutes. We&#x27;ve used it about 30 times since buying it, and it&#x27;s holding up very well. We even used it to shave the dog once. The different attachments let you choose the length of hair, and you can change the angles of the cut easily.&lt;br /&gt;My only negative for this kit it that the handle can get pretty warm if you&#x27;re using it for a long time, which shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you&#x27;re doing 1 haircut. We only noticed it when we were shaving the dog. We had to stop a couple of times and let the unit cool down.</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight shaver.  My husband loves this.  Much cheaper and lighter than our previous trimmer.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me a great looking haircut with this kit. A great way to save money on haircuts. Will recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> It saves me a bit of money when I use this product. The main gripe I have with it is that the &amp;#34;chrome&amp;#34; is cheaply put on and it comes off easily. If the chrome was actual metal instead of cheap plastic, I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with maintaining it. It cleans off pretty easily and it isn&#x27;t that difficult to pluck the hair out of it. If you are looking forward to saving yourself $10-14 for each haircut, look no further!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t feel as sturdy as the conair it is replacing.  the guides/guards seem flimsy - we are keeping the old guards to use.</li>
    <li> Bought this , not to cut hair, but to just get a clean sideburns look.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t even cut that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve watched the video, and while they show it to work, I can&#x27;t get it to do anything.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I only spent $10.00 on sale and now use it as a paperweight.</li>
