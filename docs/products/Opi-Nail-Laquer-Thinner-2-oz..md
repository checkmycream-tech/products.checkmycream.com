### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price too!</li>
      <li>OPIProducts produce as advertised and are the best products to me.</li>
      <li>Very happy with it.</li>
      <li>:D</li>
      <li>and you are good to go!</li>
      <li>It does evaporate easily!!!</li>
      <li>stuff is also great for removing labels and stickers.  </li>
      <li>And, the dispenser is great.  </li>
      <li>It works good.</li>
      <li>Good 2 drops all you need</li>
      <li>This is a good product</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This works like magic.</li>
      <li>I love this laquer but wished it had a better seal or top on it.</li>
      <li>The product works well with all nail polish products, love the flexibility.</li>
      <li>and I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This is a good amount of lacquer thinner that with just two drops at a time, should last me for years.</li>
      <li>The first time I ever used the thinner</li>
      <li>Be sure to always put  the cap back on, as this does evaporate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I had a Sally Hansen polish that gummed up quickly (seems an issue with that brand), and this thinner restored its consistency to normal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest trying with a polish you don&#x27;t care about for starters to get used to how much to add until you get the right consistency &amp; ultimately the right result.</li>
      <li>It revived most of my old dry nail polishes.</li>
      <li>Works great and only needs a few drops, so it&#x27;ll last a long time! :)</li>
      <li>It revived my old nail polish from last year that was super clunky back to its smooth texture with just 2 drops.</li>
      <li>Make sure you&#x27;ve got this tightly sealed when done.  </li>
      <li>When I checked to see if the top was on tightly by squeezing the bottle it did leak.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it to everyone who loves doing nails.</li>
      <li>it does not have a strong chemical stench like other brands.  </li>
      <li>I have had to use a few more drops than the bottle states however.</li>
      <li>A few drops extends the life of your favourite nail polish--great value for both the product and to get more applications out of your polishes.</li>
      <li>Several drops right into the bottle</li>
      <li>The product is great and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, the shipping took a little over a week, however the product leaked during shipping and was left with only half a bottle.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much, just several drops before you can see results.</li>
      <li>It makes old polish like new again and makes it last even longer.</li>
      <li>Works well to thin nail lacquers without the strong odor.  </li>

<li> It makes old polish like new again and makes it last even longer.</li>
<li> Works well to thin nail lacquers without the strong odor.  </li>
<li> but you get LOTS of usage from it because you only need 1-2 drops to thin your polish back to normal.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this with OPI, julep, and various other polishes.</li>
<li> Though this is a small bottle, it takes a while to completely use it.</li>
<li> Just open and put a few drops in.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s thin and goes on like new again!</li>
<li> This works to thin out older polish.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Some other thinners require you to buy a separate dropper in order to use it.    </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s thin as new.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s required you give at least one they definitely do not deserve it!</li>
<li> So, although it&#x27;s a small bottle, it should last you a few months.  </li>
<li> I have several bottles of nail polish that sit on my shelf and an become thick over time.</li>
<li> This was a waste of my time and money.</li>
<li> Unlike other companies OPI&#x27;s thinner does not contain acetone, which will make the color of polish dull.  </li>
<li> If your nail polish is beginning to get thick and gloppy, all you do is add a few drops of this thinner and \\&quot;wha-lah!\\&quot;  </li>
<li> and I only received the receipt wtf.</li>
<li> It is a small bottle</li>
<li> Thins thick, nail polishes.  </li>
<li> Since the plastic bottle is so thick (making squeezing very difficult) that it&#x27;s difficult to add too much.  </li>
<li> Follow the instructions closely, using a very small amount, or you&#x27;ll ruin the polish rather than revive it.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money ordering from them because you will never get the order and the customer service is horrible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a thinner for months and finally settled on this one. It is a small bottle but you get LOTS of usage from it because you only need 1-2 drops to thin your polish back to normal.</li>
    <li> When I received my package, I could smell that it had been leaking. When I checked to see if the top was on tightly by squeezing the bottle it did leak. This is a good product but I don&#x27;t know how to prevent this from happening except to tighten the bottle before packaging it.</li>
    <li> If your nail polish is beginning to get thick and gloppy, all you do is add a few drops of this thinner and \\&quot;wha-lah!\\&quot;  it&#x27;s thin and goes on like new again! This works on all polish, regular, pearl or sparkly.  And, the dispenser is great.  Just open and put a few drops in.  Some other thinners require you to buy a separate dropper in order to use it.    A little goes a long way. So, although it&#x27;s a small bottle, it should last you a few months.  NOTE:  Make sure you&#x27;ve got this tightly sealed when done.  It does evaporate easily!!!</li>
    <li> The product works well with all nail polish products, love the flexibility. :D Highly recommend it to everyone who loves doing nails.</li>
    <li> Works well to thin nail lacquers without the strong odor.  Thins thick, nail polishes.  Highly recommend this product. I will use this again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product over a month ago from sunshine beauty and I only received the receipt wtf. Then when I contacted them they told me to take a picture of the package and send it to them. I did that. They never replied I emailed them again and still no answer. This was a waste of my time and money. Don&#x27;t waste your money ordering from them because you will never get the order and the customer service is horrible. I would give them no stars but it&#x27;s required you give at least one they definitely do not deserve it!</li>
    <li> This works like magic. I have several bottles of nail polish that sit on my shelf and an become thick over time. Several drops right into the bottle and it&#x27;s thin as new. I have had to use a few more drops than the bottle states however.</li>

    <li> I love this product.  A few drops extends the life of your favourite nail polish--great value for both the product and to get more applications out of your polishes.</li>
    <li> It helped saved me tons on money on nail polish. It also works well on non-OPI products. Just needs 2 or 3 drops and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> The product is great and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, the shipping took a little over a week, however the product leaked during shipping and was left with only half a bottle. I love this laquer but wished it had a better seal or top on it.</li>
    <li> just what I needed.  it works well and helps my nail polish work for me longer</li>
    <li> Good 2 drops all you need</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it not only for thinning my polish but also removing it.  it does not have a strong chemical stench like other brands.  Since the plastic bottle is so thick (making squeezing very difficult) that it&#x27;s difficult to add too much.  A couple drop is all that is needed.  Though this is a small bottle, it takes a while to completely use it. Unlike other companies OPI&#x27;s thinner does not contain acetone, which will make the color of polish dull.  Be sure to always put  the cap back on, as this does evaporate quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is also great for removing labels and stickers.  Does not leave a greasy residue like goo-gone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this with OPI, julep, and various other polishes. It works good. I have had two problems with it though. I used it on my OPI Alpine Snow, and it turned it matte and streaky. It also did not work for my Seche Vote. I would recommend using the Seche for that.</li>
    <li> The first time I ever used the thinner and I love this product. It revived most of my old dry nail polishes. You don&#x27;t need much, just several drops before you can see results. Saved me a lot of money.</li>
    <li> Works great and only needs a few drops, so it&#x27;ll last a long time! :)</li>
    <li> This nail lacquer thinner does what it&#x27;s intended to do. I had a Sally Hansen polish that gummed up quickly (seems an issue with that brand), and this thinner restored its consistency to normal. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Thank God for this OPI thinner, helps me keep my collection of OPI nail polishs. Great price too!</li>
