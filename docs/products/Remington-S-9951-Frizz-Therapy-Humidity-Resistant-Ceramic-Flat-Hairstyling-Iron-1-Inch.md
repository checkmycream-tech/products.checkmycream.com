<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s suppose to:)</li>
    <li> Having curly and often frizzy hair, I have always been skeptical about products that promise frizz-free hair.   When I read the review of this Flat Iron in Good Housekeeping, I was so impressed with the rave reviews that I purchased it at Amazon.  By George, the thing really works!  Not only did it work quickly with minimal damage to my hair, but it left my hair looking shiny, straight and silky and it lasted over several days even in rainy, humid weather.  Bravo, Remington!  I have since recommended this flat iron to all my friends and those who bought it love it too.</li>
    <li> I like to use a small size straightener for my bangs, but  this one has permanently damaged them. One section won&#x27;t wave at  all anymore, the rest is singed with little waves going in all different  directions. Perhaps my hair wasn&#x27;t completely dry when I used the iron, but  it shouldn&#x27;t have produced this much damage. It has been over a month since  use and my bangs are still horrible. Also, the temperature control is in the   spot where the tool is held, so I keep accidentally changing the temperature.  Poor design.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after reading all the great reviews here on Amazon.  It did not disappoint!  It gets hot very fast and glides across my hair without any pulling!  It gets my hair nice and straight.  I have very thick, curly, hard to straighten hair so the high temperature this iron reaches is great for me. I was able to get my hair done in less than 15 minutes! (record time!)  I haven&#x27;t been able yet to see how it performs in high humidity situations due to the dry cold winter where I live.  Humidity is the worst enemy to my hair when I straighten but I have no doubt this too will work just as everyone has reported.  I am so satisfied with my purchase!  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I like to straighten my hair every once in a while, but if there is just the slightest bit of humidity all my work is for nothing because my hair will curl and frizz. However, when I used the Remington S9951, my hair stayed straight and no frizz.  I also gave the Remington S9951 a true test...I straightened my sister&#x27;s hair for a boat trip and her hair held up very well. No frizz and no curl.  A couple of down sides 1. - it&#x27;s only a 1 inch base, and I would rather a 2\\&quot; since I have long curly hair; but I am willing to work with the 1\\&quot;.  2. - the temperature control button is located exactly where your fingers rest while in use, but there is a locking feature that you can use to lock in the desired temp.  I think its a great product and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron in July 2010 and I&#x27;m completely amazed with how well it works!  I have a lot of hair that is full and sort of course and with just a few swipes of this flat iron, I have smooth, sleek, swinging hair like you see in advertisements.  I never believed this was possible.  I&#x27;ve used several other flat irons but they never left my hair as smooth  with no puffiness like this does.  Plus, I don&#x27;t have to do anything to it until it needs washing about 5 days later.  I just run a brush through it in the morning and I&#x27;m ready to go.  I&#x27;ve been out in the rain and humidity and my hair never gets frizzy.  When I bought this, it was $49.99 and now it&#x27;s even less than that so it&#x27;s a real bargain.  I highly recommend this flat iron.  I feel like a new person since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Great product   Great price  Fast delivery    It&#x27;s light and glides smoothly on the hair.</li>
    <li> There are a lot of flat iron&#x27;s in the market and I&#x27;m always skeptic as I&#x27;m very sensitive of these kind of product of the damage it will cause, I read in Allure magazine that this is the top flat iron reviewed by editors or consumers. I bought it and will buy it again, this will be my last flat iron brand</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product that I would highly recommend to everyone/anyone. It heats in seconds, straightens wonderfully, creates shine as it defrizzes the hair. There is no need to purchase the more expensive flat irons; this one is more than worth the money. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because of all the positive reviews.  I was looking for a good flat iron that was reasonably priced to replace my old iron.  This one is very good because it offers higher heat settings.  I have coarse hair and need that extra heat to even straighten it enough to make it smoother looking.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener.  I have very long, easily damaged hair, and I&#x27;m able to straighten it with just one quick swipe, causing no damage at all.  The only problem is the mislabel of how to lock the buttons: The manual says to hold down +, but doing that puts it immediately at the highest temperature intead.  The - button both locks and unlocks.</li>
    <li> I considered buying an expensive straightener, but after browsing countless flat irons online, I decided to try this Remington one.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about one month, but so far it works great.  I have wavy, thick, hair that falls just below my chin and I typically straighten my hair in 3 sections, which had been taking me almost 20 minutes.  With this straightener, I&#x27;ve cut that time in half to about 10 minutes - precious time in the morning before work!  Also, I always have had a larger (1.5\\&quot;-2\\&quot;) iron in the past, so I wasn&#x27;t sure about a 1\\&quot; one, but I like it - I think it gives me more control over particular pieces.  Only time will tell if this straightener will hold up but, so far, it works great and I&#x27;m glad I decided to go with this one.</li>
    <li> So I have had my hair straightened plethora times and in all the different ways. Recently, I had it blow dried out then straightened with a flat iron and within 3 hours, I looked like a lioness with plenty of courage! My hair is extremely curly and does tend to frizz up when humidity hits...although many compliment my spiral curls, having it straight and staying straight for a more formal look is something that I yearn for...now my problems can be put to rest with my new found best friend! I received this early in the day...I had just gotten back from the gym with a coiffe that was completely frizzed out and damp. But naturally, the child in me could not wait and had to sample this immediately. Well, needless to say, I was in awe within the first five minutes....the ease and the simplicity of finally having straight smooth hair was finally at my fingertips for a fraction of the cost! And the frizz control is indeed true....I put my straightened hair up in a clip then took a nice steamy shower and when I came out, my hair still looked fantastic...as a matter of fact, I just needed to blow dry it to add some \\&quot;poof\\&quot; (yeah volume) to the crown....otherwise it looked spectacular. My son was amazed, my husband stunned and my friends mesmerized to actually see me with straight hair. As for products to use in conjunction with this is all a personal thing...being that everyone has different texture hair they need to feel out the products out there, but I do strongly suggest using a heat protector if you do use this often. Rest assured, this $39 will be the best money spent...the reviews are correct and I too am a happy delighted customer...I LOVE twirling my hair now and feeling it silky, smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is a really good flat iron. Unfortunately, with my thick, naturally kinky hair, even when my hair is blow dried straight this doesn&#x27;t completely get the job done. It goes up to 430 degrees but that&#x27;s not quite enough. When my hair was relaxed though, this worked like a charm. If your hair is only wavy or slightly curly this will be a great product for you but if you have Afro-type hair, you&#x27;ll need something else.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m a forty year old Mom who has never known how to handle my thick unruly curls. Very easy to use and does what it claims to do. I use it one my 11 year old when she wants straight hair. I never thought I could have straight hair without going to the salon but this has defenitely taken care of that. My hair is staight and shiny and could last up to a week if I don&#x27;t let it get wet. If it gets wet I just touch it up and wallah I&#x27;m good to go again.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before I bought this.  It is AMAZING!  Coming from a lifetime frizzy girl, this product does what it says.  My daughter is borrowing it too cause she loves the sleekness it gives her long hair.  And for the price-WOW!  I highly recommend the Remington.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic in what it does for my hair.  The problem is the control buttons are on the outside where your hand goes so you will continually turn up or down the heat or turn it off.  That is very frustrating.  The controls should be on the inside or on the other end of the iron.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old daughter used this flat iron for the first time at a friends house.  She came home and I noticed a difference in her hair.  Not only did it straighten but it also adds shine.  I would rec-amend   this product and give it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Aside from getting hot a tad bit too fast compared to other flat irons, this is a godsend. Recommended to everyone looking for a good-priced flat iron that gets the job done nicely.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing straightener for only $40! It not only straightens my hair, but keeps it straight all day long. Doesn&#x27;t get static or frizz. Very easy to use and light. The temperature settings are really easy and useful. It also comes with a 2 year warranty and they will replace it with a new one if it breaks. I love it and would recommend to others.   Hair type: Frizzy, curly, wavy, long.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of flat irons:  Andis, Remington (Wet 2 Straight), Revlon, Conair, and at the salon, Chi.  Hands down, this is the best!  I have frizzy, wavy, medium (not fine or coarse) hair, that volume wise is on the normal to thin side and length - hits the middle of my bra band.  If the humidity is 40% or more or if I am warm (starting to perspire), my hair will frizz and look like a wavy, puff ball.  I wash my hair every other to every 3rd day and with all other flat irons, I would have to re-flatten my hair every day, at least once.  With this iron, I can go forever!!  I am serious.  It has been very rainy up here in the NE and I haven&#x27;t had to touch up my hair once!  I was even out in sprinkles on several occasions and had NO FRIZZ!  I mean my hair stayed board straight!  I am so sold on this flat iron, I am thinking about buying 2 more, just to have on hand in case they ever stop making this particular product!  Also, one pass can straighten your hair (if you have hair like mine).  I have always set the temp to the highest setting (430 degrees...not tried any of the lower temps)and can pass over my hair one time and it is straight.  I turn the very ends of my hair under, too.  This iron takes me half the time, minimum, to get the results I want.  If you want flat, board straight, shiny hair in no time, this is the product you want.  The price is right, too.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this iron!  OKAY, one thing I wish was better...the length of the plates.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  I have very fine frizzy hair which is easily damaged.  However, since using this product my hair appears to have less breakage.  In addition, my hair is shiny and looks better than it ever has.  I highly recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> I finally retired a 6 year old hair straighter made by Conair which seemed to do the job.  I thought the way to go when I looked to purchase a new one was with Chi.  Don&#x27;t be suckered into buying a brand name.  I read the reviews on this product before purchasing and thought for the price it was worth the try.  I have long thick hair down to the middle of my back.  I have a LOT of hair, just ask my stylist while he is blow drying it.  My hair is naturally wavy and dry.  I add Kerastase hair oil to my damp hair before styling and my hair can go at least two days without washing before it starts even looking or feeling oily.  With that being said, with such dry hair I was looking forward to the special oil Remington adds to the ceramic plates.  What I found was the following:  1.  This baby heats up to 430 degrees, which means you only need one pass to straighten. There are flexible plates that seems to grab hold of each hair and with my long thick wavy hair, one pass is a blessing and a time saver!  2.  The oil on the plates has reduced my need to add as much Kerastase before styling.  3.  Other users complained about the button placement being where you hold the product.  This is true, however, if you press and hold the minus button for 3 seconds, it locks all the buttons including the on/off button.  Easily press the plus button for three seconds to unlock.  4.  There is some kind of science to turning this thing on which I haven&#x27;t quite figured out yet.  I press and hold the on/off switch to turn it on, and it seems if I don&#x27;t adjust the temperature, it automatically shuts off in the first 30 seconds.  Luckily it heats to maximum temperature in 30 seconds so this hasn&#x27;t been a huge problem.  5.  Automatic shut off after 1 hour.  I never again have to worry, \\&quot;Did I turn it off?\\&quot;  I love this product, and my friend who uses an expensive Chi tried mine and found she loved it better too!  I&#x27;m so glad I saved $50 and bought the Remington instead!</li>
    <li> It made short work of my curls, waves, frizz.  So I&#x27;ve got to love it.  My new friend, though, stays hot even though I follow , TO THE LETTER, the directions for turning it off.  I have no alternative but to let it go the hour for turning itself off.  Reviews at this site helped me, but price, in the mid-range was the final &#x27;decider&#x27;. This is my first go at owning a straightner -- Remington&#x27;s S9951 works, is my new BFF. All through high school I was praised for such lovely curls by the very ones who had graceful self-designed styles.  When my hair is straight I appear to have a vast store of credibility.  Believe it!  And when I see corn-silk hair on a woman I respond by unwittingly  crediting HER with something ethereal.  Go figure.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that this straightened really really well. The wet to straight one that I had didn&#x27;t do that great (I gave it away) I was happy when I took a nap and woke up my hair was still  straight and my hair ALWAYS gets messed up when I lay down or toss and turn while i&#x27;m sleeping. I&#x27;m sure that this will work in the summer time the best it&#x27;s winter right now but I&#x27;m very happy that I bought this and it was worth the money. I hope this review helps anyone who reads it I bought mine from walmart but there&#x27;s only two of them left there now. This straightener is amazing it works and it&#x27;s cute c:</li>
    <li> This is my first ever flat iron, and I have to say I&#x27;m pretty impressed. My hair is not super thick, but it is fairly coarse and naturally curly. With this iron, it takes me about 20 minutes to straighten, but the key is - it STAYS straight! I&#x27;ve put my hair up and taken showers or been out in the rain and I have to say my hair stays straight. Very minimal frizz! Plus, it heats up quickly and has adjustable temp. I would recommend this iron. Plus, it&#x27;s a good price point vs. CHI and some others.</li>
    <li> I have gone through so many hair straightens in the past.  I have purchased expensive salon models and cheap store ones.  None have ever worked the way this one works.  The biggest test was that I straightened my super curly hair on a rainy day and it stayed straight all day!  With other straighteners my hair will get frizzy and wavy from just walking from my car into work (even with an umbrella) but I do not have this problem anymore!  I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments in the past week on my hair.  Everyone thought I got a new haircut...but I told them it was just a new straightener.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a new straightener!</li>
    <li> My hair is so thin and breaks easily, This iron is not so heavy on hair, It doesn&#x27;t cause this burned hair smell, gets all hot in no time, helps control frizzy hair and makes the hair all shiny! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have thick hair and this flat iron really does keep my hair frizz free and smooth all day! Absolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is awesome.  I had bought a Solia Flat Iron and spent $80 and didn&#x27;t think it worked much better than my $20 Conair that broke so I returned it and after much research, I decided to purchase this one at Target and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> I read about this product in a magazine recently and I am so glad I decided to order it!  I live in Hawaii right now and this flatiron keeps my hair straight all day long even with the heat and humidity of our island.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the digital readout and the easy handling of the unit.  She doesn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the outside buttons because she holds the unit beyond that point.  So far she&#x27;s very pleased with the results and with the quality.  When she took it to an overnight, several of the girls used her iron instead of the more expensive units they brought with them because of the greater control over the temperature.  Apparently most have a dial that doesn&#x27;t tell them how hot or how much hotter each line will make the iron and they find that frustrating when they go from \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot; to \\&quot;fried hair\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> My CHI has been getting older and I needed to get another one.  After hearing about the Remington S9951 through Good Housekeeping, I decided to look into it.  After reading the multiple reviews on Amazon, I decided to purchase it as an experiment.       PROS:  It straitens my hair as well as my CHI.  The variable settings go up to 430 degrees.  There is no burning smell like I sometimes get with the CHI.  The price.    CONS:  Some of the ceramic around the edges is already coming off and I only got it a month ago.  The buttons are in a bad spot and you can accidentally turn it off.  It started squeaking the day after I bought it (when I open and close it).  I am going to try to oil the mechanism to see if that will work.    Overall it was a good purchase.  I think I prefer the CHI, but this is a reasonable alternative.</li>
    <li> love it , works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over six months now, and I absolutely love it. My hair isn&#x27;t curly or anything, it just gets frizzy some days, and it really does tame the frizz extremely well. My hair stays straight for about two days.The biggest problem I had is when I brought it to Europe. I assumed it was dual voltage, but after about the tenth time of using it, it sort of blew up the adapter, so I don&#x27;t know if it was my adapter which did it in, or if it really is did in completely since I&#x27;m still in Europe. If you are considering on taking it to another country double check your adapter! I would recommend this to anybody who wants to get rid of the frizz with an affordable and effective straightener.</li>
    <li> My Hot Tools flat iron had been slowly succumbing to entropy over time, getting less and less hot as it aged. When I was on the market for a new one, I despaired of getting a good flat iron for anything less than $100. I really needed one as I was traveling to a professional conference soon and wanted to look presentable for the job market. But after reading all the reviews for this one on Amazon, I decided to take a risk and see what kind of quality I could get for $50.     Wow. I am really amazed by this flat iron. I&#x27;ve used and had people use Chi flat irons on my hair and this iron performs almost as well as the Chi. You do get what you pay for, but the difference in quality for the level of frizz in my hair? This works just fine. If you have SUPER coarse and curly hair, then a more hardcore iron would serve you better. But I&#x27;m Asian-American, have medium to fine hair (rather than super coarse and straight like many of my fellows) and really just need a flat iron just to tame the frizzy waves.     My hair slips smoothly through the plates. The iron gets hot fast and beeps to let you know. The temp settings go up really high and the LED screen is backlit for better reading. There&#x27;s a little lock on the handle to keep the iron closed when you need to put it away, which is awesome. I&#x27;ve get to burn myself on the edges of the iron, but I can see how it might be easy, despite the recessed plates. I can do my medium-length hair in about 10-minutes. My hair steams a bit when I iron it, but it might be in part due to the heat protectant I spray on. My flat-ironed hair looks amazing for nearly 2 days before my naturally oily scalp makes it look greasy. (With no flat ironing, my hair actually looks clean longer) No frizz. No flyaways. Hair is soft and shiny.     I got rid of my Hot Tools iron, but kept the heat resistant pouch to carry my new flat iron in. I&#x27;m really pleased with my purchase and hope that it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different methods to straighten my hair.  From products to dryers to irons.  This iron beats them all.  I can get my very curly hair straight with one, yes, one pass.  It stays for at least 2 days-no frizz.  I am in love with this iron.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about everything on amazon for frizzy hair. People have raved about so many products to try etc. and they did NOT work for my hair. THIS was great. It made my hair smooth and kept my hair soft until my next wash. AMAZING! A must buy!</li>
    <li> I have tried flat irons over the years and have had no luck - my hair is thick and course.  I bought the Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control because of ratings in Good Housekeeping Magazine and the reviews on line.  I love it!  I like the fact that I can regulate the temperature and that it heats fast.  I wash my hair less because styling lasts for a couple of days and my hair is healthier for it.  The only downside is that my electric lights pulse when the iron is on - I guess it draws a lot of juice.  Make sure you plug into a surge protected outlet.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a Christmas Gift for 16 year old grand daughter with bangs.  This straightener works, it keeps them from curling up all  day long.</li>
    <li> I have terrible frizzy hair due to hot flashes,and so many medications!I like the iron,but even lowest setting is too high for my fragile hair,so I cool it off with a moist baby wipe before flat ironing.I think this would be an excellent iron for normal hair.</li>
    <li> I first read about this flattening iron in Allure magazine&#x27;s Best of Beauty issue. After reading the reviews on this site, I decided to give it a try and swap it out for the Chi flat iron I&#x27;d been using. I&#x27;ve now been using this one for about a month. It works ok, but my Chi does a better job. I&#x27;ve found that when I use this iron with the styling products I typically use, the therapy frizz control serum that&#x27;s infused in the plates makes my hair slightly greasy--not shiny. If you&#x27;re using this iron, go lightly on other styling products. Simply put--there are better flat irons out there if you&#x27;re willing to spend the money on them.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, coarse, curly, color-treated hair and was hoping that the Remington flat iron would live up to all the positive reviews I saw on Amazon, but alas, for me, it was not to be.  Initially, the straightener performed up to it&#x27;s press clippings. My hair was soft, shiny and basically frizz-free, but it was the next time I used it that something went awry. My tresses were dull, fuzzy and felt stiff as a board. Thinking that maybe the high setting 410 may have \\&quot; fried \\&quot; my hair, I re-adjusted the control to 392...same thing.  Finally, after other attempts and adjustments producing the same results, I made the decision to return the iron.</li>
    <li> I like the size and it seems to do what it says it will but... Difficult not to be pressing the buttons when using. Locking the temp seems a little random, could be the button thing. Actually scorched my hair when it went back up. When it&#x27;s on, even if the temp is locked, it makes our lights flicker, very annoying. I like the lock feature and will use it when traveling because of the size but have gone back to my old iron for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I live in a humid climate and have naturally curly hair. I have been through two Chi flat irons in two years. Considering I don&#x27;t even use a flat iron every day, that&#x27;s not such a great product life (especially considering the cost of a Chi). After doing some research, my husband bought this flat iron for me. I was skeptical and kept all the packaging so I could return it. I never did! I love that it has an on/off switch and temperature control (which the Chi&#x27;s never did), auto shut off &amp; it beeps to tell you when it&#x27;s the right temperature. Most importantly of all, it keeps my hair straight!! It really does work way better than my Chi&#x27;s ever did. The first day I used it, it was raining and my hair stayed super straight. I didn&#x27;t even need to straighten it again the second day. I would highly recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I only wish I had purchased this flat iron sooner! My long, thick hair straightens in no time with this product, and maintains style even in this humid Florida summer. The iron heats up instantly. Why pay more for other name brands? This iron provides salon quality for less money.</li>
    <li> I searched for a long time for a new flat iron! I had a Chi for a long time, but I could tell it needed to be replaced.  I saw the reviews for this one and decided to purchase it.  I LOVE it! I have thick hair and it can easily get wavy after an hour or so, but with this new flat iron I can definately tell a difference in my hair.  It stays straight for longer than before and it is definately less frizzy! I would buy this product again!     (I saw before there were problems with the buttons being hit where your hands are placed, but the flat iron can easily be locked and the buttons won&#x27;t turn the heat down or turn it off.)</li>
    <li> I purchased this product last week and I am already returning it. I had an HAI flat iron before this that lasted me almost 6 years until I dropped it 2 weeks ago and it decided not to work anymore. My friend bought this flat iron and said it did an amazing job and she loved it. I decided to give it a try and bought it. It did a really good job flat ironing my hair but what I did not like about it was the controls being on the outside. I kept hitting buttons and would either turn down the heat or turn up the heat higher than I wanted. This really bugged me. Also I feel like I cant get any tension. It glides so smooth down your hair I can get tension on it to make a slight bend in my hair to curl it under. (I have short hair) This also really bugs me. I curl my hair with my flat iron also and I could not do this with this flat iron. If you want your hair super straight then this is the flat iron for you. But if you like to use a flat iron for texture this might not be for you. I couldnt get a good grip on my hair. I am going to switch back to the HAI iron. A little more pricey but I think its worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Had the INSTYLER. I was growing tired of it and seen this one on Target.com. It had wonderful reviews and I had to have one. It worked just as everyone stated. I love straightening my hair now &#x3D;) The instyler is a thing of the past. This keeps my frizzy long hair straight all day. My hair is super long and it takes me all of 10 minutes to straighten it. Don&#x27;t take my word for it though... I&#x27;m sure after all these 5 star reviews you will try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am updating this almost 4 years later:&lt;br /&gt;The product is still great and I have the exact same straightener as when I initially reviewed! It is still like brand new :)</li>
    <li> This is a very good brand and the product works very well. I have very fine and curly hair and the flat iron truly makes it straight in no time. The results last long and totally anti-frizz. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I first read about this in Good Housekeeping and was intrigued. As fate would have it, my CHI died and I saw it at Target and figured \\&quot;what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try.\\&quot; I tend to have very healthy hair - it is colored (single process brown), but I try not to over-wash, I condition in the shower faithfully, use a leave-in conditioner too, and I don&#x27;t straighten my hair every day. But now I have fried my bangs. The only thing I can attribute this to is the iron - all my other products are the same. I&#x27;ve never increased the temperature above the default setting and I try to be very careful but it appears to be too late now. This iron is also lacking ergonomically - the buttons are in a place where I repeatedly push them while trying to straighten my hair. I can honestly say this has never happened to my hair before and I am planning to go out and buy a new CHI (as soon as my bangs grow out, that is).</li>
    <li> I have pretty curly hair but I thought I would give this a try after seeing the reviews in Good Housekeeping (got the seal of approval). I had trouble finding it b/c everyone was sold out of it but I got it today and so far I love it. I straightened all of my hair in less than 10 minutes from being curly. I must add that I was in the steamy bathroom while my shower was running and it did not phase my hair. I gets supper hot, I love the digital display, and the power off function is great so you don&#x27;t turn it off by mistake. It also gets hot really fast-almost immediately. I think it is certainly worth the $50; especially considering the Chi is $100+.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner because of the great reviews I read. I was very disappointed when I tried to use this iron on my hair.  The heat buttons are placed so you&#x27;re constantly hitting them with your hand, while trying to straighten your hair.  I tried moving my hands further up the handle but it didn&#x27;t matter.  I still kept hitting the buttons. It was constantly beeping everytime I hit the button accidently.  I gave up trying to alter my hand grip and sent the iron back for a refund.</li>
    <li> My hair is dry and curly. This flat iron is easy to use and really straightens my hair. I am so glad that I found this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best Flat Iron Period!!!    I have used T3 over $200, GHD nearly $300, They work, but for $39.99 the best I have ever used.  Buy this one don&#x27;t waste your money on the other brands.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never felt so strongly about a product after one use, but this is a great flat iron. I have thick, fine,curly hair and have used an expensive Chi flatiron for many years. I hate to say it, but this $50 straightener is better than my $140 Chi. Two negative comments, it gets really hot and unlike my Chi you can burn your head if you get too close to the roots. It is also easy to accidentally change the heat settings as the buttons are on the main grip. Otherwise, based on ability to straighten hair, this is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because I was going to Europe and needed a dual voltage model.  It worked effortlessly - not need to shift anything (tip: it runs hotter on 220 current so turn the temp down so you won&#x27;t burn your hair).  I don&#x27;t know how it does it, but the frizz control really works.  I travelled throughout Italy for two weeks, in hot humid weather, and my hair stayed smooth.  I didn&#x27;t even need to use any product in my hair to control the waving and frizz as I had back home with my Chi.  This is my first Amazon product review but I was so impressed with this product that I had to share! (I even showed it to my hair stylist so she could recommend it to her clients).  I have put away my Chi and am now using this flat iron at home as well.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever used. My friends all own Chi&#x27;s but never felt the need to buy one because I saw no difference than the cheap one I had at home before I bought this one. My hair is super straight and soft and smooth when I use this one and I no longer have to worry about frizz which has always been a problem for me. Cheaper than most flat irons out there and is twice as good.</li>
    <li> I just tried it once and I liked it really much.Usually it takes me half an hour (at least) to straighten my hair,but now I&#x27;m done for 10 minutes.I love ittt!! :)</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about using another heating element on my hair but the variable temps on this iron allow me to select the one best for me. I like this product !</li>
    <li> I just got this flat iron from Target for a sale price of $39.99 and it was money well-spent!  I&#x27;m so happy I made this purchase, especially after I read all the rave reviews on amazon.  I have very long, thick &amp; wavy hair and find it a hassle whenever I have to straighten it, especially in the summer.  Last night, I let my hair air-dry and then used this iron before bed.  It took only 10-15 minutes to flat iron my hair (which usually takes at least 30-45 min. to blow dry straight and iron) and it was PIN-STRAIGHT!  However, I don&#x27;t suggest having damp hair when flattening because the iron is extremely hot.  I woke up with my hair perfectly straight and even survived a day of rain and NO FRIZZ and no other hair products were required!  Needless to say I love this product and will never use another flat iron again (unless Remington comes up with an even better model.)    Highly recommended for thick hair.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST straightener and at a fraction of the price.  I have a teenage daughter with naturally curly hair.  She would get so upset because our Instyler wouldn&#x27;t make her curly hair poker straight.  This straightener gets it done!  She beams everytime she straightens her hair.  We love it!!!</li>
    <li> I was using a 2 inch wide iron with teeth because that is what I thought I needed for my very thick, very long, very wavy hair.  I was unhappy because my hair always looked damaged. (And the teeth in the iron were getting sharp and bent.)  I saw the great reviews for this Remington that said it compared well to the super expensive irons, but cost less than half the money.  I&#x27;ve used it quite a few times already and I am not disappointed!  I am surprised how quickly it it works.  I am very happy that I didn&#x27;t spend more than $100.  I am very happy that my hair looks so much healthier.  I totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was so in hopes that this product would really control the frizz caused by the humidity of south Alabama.  I was disappointed!  This product is no better than the Chi flat iron that I have been using.  Actually, it does not work as well as the flat iron that I had.</li>
    <li> Heats up super quickly, maintains heat well. Gets my curly hair flat on the first try every time. Also, works well for creating flips (turning the flatiron to make a slight curve in/out at the bottom). I like that you can lock the buttons, and keep the flatiron locked closed if you need to.</li>
    <li> After reading the many wonderful reviews for this product I decided to give it a try. I have never spent less than $100 on a hair straighter including the CHI, babyliss, sedu, and rusk, so I figured that $50 dollars was a steal if it worked. My hair is very curly and very frizzy so I usually blow dry it straight before I even bother to run a straightener through it. With this one, I let my hair air dry curly and then used the iron. It worked just as well as every other hair straightener that I have tried. I would not say it was better, but definitely in the same category. It also curls very well which is a requirement for my hair straighteners. However, there was one big flaw that I couldn&#x27;t overlook and returned because of. As others reviewers have said, the buttons are placed in a way that it is impossible to not push which didn&#x27;t bother me as  much when I was straightening, but made it almost impossible to curl which I prefer so it had to go back. For anybody who is able to overlook that flaw, this iron is more than worth the price.</li>
    <li> Attractive look. 1st use was without a hitch. Product was well packed by the vendor. Overall satisfied w/ the product/purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using flat irons for 20 years. In all that time, I&#x27;ve never found one that works as well as this one. My hair frizzes with the tiniest bit of humidity. Recently I travelled home to Seattle and experienced more than one rain storm. My hair remained perfect! It took a couple of times to get used to the fact that iron does not close securely over the hair; the hair slides easily through the iron.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/loose curls, baby fine, fragile hair just past my shoulders and have been looking for a flatiron that would take out the frizz factor without frying my delicate hair. Whenever it gets humid my hair turns into a frizzball. This flatiron is an absolute miracle. Everyone kept saying \\&quot;ya gotta get a Chi\\&quot;....100 bucks um no thank you! So I did some research and happened upon this baby! WOW!!!!! I love it, my hair is silky smooth, shiny and with just a few swipes with the iron. I agree the controls were not placed in a good place, however after reading some of the other reviews, I found they were right as far as locking the temp. The instructions say to press and hold the + button but that is wrong if you press and hold the - button a little lock icon appears in the display and then hitting the buttons is not a problem at all. Well I don&#x27;t think I \\&quot;gotta get a Chi\\&quot;.....for half the price I got a fantastic deal on a fantastic product. Big thumbs up to Remington on a great idea!!!</li>
    <li> I really love this straightner because it does its job the right way and extremely fast! I have extremely curly, thick, hard to manage hair. I have spent hundreds and hundreds on straightners and they never did NEAR as good a job as this one. Who ever said the more you pay, the better you get was wrong because this one is cheap and does exactly what I want! I use temp 390 but it can go higher. I saw some bad reviews saying it was poorly made because when they use it, they accidently push buttons. But there is an easy way to lock the screen so that wont happen!   It makes my hair very smooth and silky the way I want but still leaves body so my hair looks beautiful!</li>
    <li> this is one of the best product&#x27;s i have purchased for my hair. It works great and if i would have known about it sooner, I would have been using it a long time ago. It leaves your hair shinny and straight without any damage.</li>
    <li> I have really liked this flat iron. I have thick coarse hair and it works great!!</li>
    <li> My hair iron died right before my birthday, so I searched online for another that worked well, but wasn&#x27;t as expensive. This one had a lot of good reviews and was half the price of my 1st.     Pros -- The instructions were helpful -- don&#x27;t iron until your hair is dry or you&#x27;ll cook your hair! It heats up fast, works well and quickly straightens.     Con -- I like the digital temp, but I end up pushing the buttons (and changing the temp) while I&#x27;m straightening. This is a small nuisance.    It has a lock to keep it closed, but says not to lock it while the irons hot so I&#x27;m sure how useful the feature is.</li>
    <li> Bought this for those humid summer days.  So far it has done what it says.  I have fine hair but lots of it and it gets crazy curls rather than pretty curls.  I flat iron my hair and it stays straight without curling, even on humid days and during rainy days.  My hair got wet one day when I was running from my car to the store in the rain and it did not even curl.  Highly recommend.  Price is very reasonable for such a great product.  And for those who complain about the placement of the setting buttons - just press the minus button for 3 seconds and a lock sign appears in the temp window.  Do the same to unlock it - simple.</li>
    <li> I used to be a CHI die-hard until it stopped working magically one morning. I bought this flatiron after reading the review in Allure and I love it. I heats up quickly, straightens well and kills the frizzies! Woo!</li>
    <li> My hair is REALLY curly.... &amp;this product works really well on it! It gets it extremely straight and it takes half the time than my previous straightener. I am so happy I got this!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because of the frizz control and humidity resistant feature. I used the flat iron and the very next day my hair needed to be redone. As an African American woman I worry about putting to much heat to may hair.  My hair texture is curly but not course so it tends to curl up at the smallest amount of humidity.  So when another African American woman said you would be amazed I was expecting my hair to stay straight for more than one day.  Like other reviewers have mention the buttons are definitely in place where you will bump into them, it does cause you to try to hold the iron in way to avoid hitting the buttons.  I am sad to say that I will be returning this flat iron for a different product.</li>
    <li> This iron FAR exceeds all flat irons I&#x27;ve ever had--and I usually buy one 3x the price! I have thin, damaged, naturally curly hair (what a combo!), and this makes my hair amazing! I dropped mine and unfortunately broke it. While waiting a few weeks for my new one to ship, I had to go back to my $200 iron and it was dredful. Get this iron, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> This straightner is great! I have long hair, and it usually is troublesome to deal with straightners. With this one I have to say, I am completely satisfied! I don&#x27;t have to use any other additional products for my hair to stay straight! It is a completely awesome product, the price is totally affordable, and it works just as any other expensive brands!</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product due to the fact that I have extremely curly frizzy hair.  However I read the reviews and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Well to my surprise it is everything they say it is.  My hair has never been this straight before.  Plus, it lasts for days.  I absolutely love this product and would definitely recommend it and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> If you are reading this your probably like me and wanted to know what people thought of this product. Well after reading some great reviews on this straightner, I made a decision to buy it at target. This is a FANTASTIC hair straightner and well WORTH the price($50.00). I have long,thin,curly,frizzy hair. I love that the heat goes above 400 degrees. It heats up in a minute and stays that temp. throughout straightning. My hair has NEVER been so straight and frizz-free before in my life. I was shocked how beautiful my hair came out. With my OLD straightner, after a couple of hours, my hair usually starts to get curly again and is really frizzy in about an hour. With this staightner, after some heavy partying, my hair was straight and frizz-free the entire day AND night!!!!! Amazing! The next day i just ran the straightner through my hair and I didnt even have to wash and straighten it again. My hair still looked great. I thought that the 1-inch would be small, but it was a great size even though I have long hair. So I am recommending this flat iron to anyone that wants beautiful flat frizz-free hair. If I could, I would give it 10 stars.</li>
    <li> This is the first straightener I have used, so I can&#x27;t compare to others.  I can attest to the fact that I have medium length, moderately curly hair and I am able to straighten my hair with one pass at 410, although for a more polished look I do two passes.  I am able to get two days out of my style without any signifigant frizz.  However, it is fall and the humidity level is pretty low.  My only real complaint is the instructions state to hold the \\&quot;+\\&quot; key to lock the buttons.  After some trial and error I figured out that holding the \\&quot;-\\&quot; key actually acheived this.  Feel like it is a good value.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive it is for how well it works. They hit a homerun on this one. The only complaint I have is that it leaves a slight odor on the hair. But overall I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter I bought her a chi a few years ago and she would be working on her hair for a half hour. Then I saw this and bought it for her it only takes her 10-15 minutes with this.  I thought I would give it a try my hair is very thick and curly and did my hair in 15 minutes we went to a outdoor concert it was 97 degrees and stayed straight the whole weekend! No frizz only had to touch up for second day. Amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair. I had been using a wider straightener and my stylist suggested a Chi brand straightener. I looked and they are much too expensive for my budget. So....I looked for others on Amazon. I am quite surprised by this one and purchased after reading the reviews. This heats up quickly, leaves my hair feeling soft and it is straight in 1/2 the time than with my other straightening iron. After I am done, it looks like I just left a salon and that NEVER happened with my other straightener. Great product!</li>
    <li> this flat iron is like heaven on earth. it gets my hair soooo soft &amp; straight. i just love it. i have thick african american hair &amp; it takes a lot 2 get it straight but with the remington its practically effortless. i love the fact that it has the lcd monitor on the side telling you the temperature. it doesnt even feel like your straightening your hair b/c ur hair just glides through the ceramic plates &amp; becomes silky &amp; soft. the flat iron does get really hot so make sure that you lay it on a towel or something while straightening your hair (theres now the outline of a flat iron burned into my couch). another thing i would advise is to use a heat protectant spray; the remington goes up tp 430 degrees so a heat protectan is a must. overall i am VERY pleased with the remington hair straightener &amp; i would recommend it to anybody :)</li>
    <li> This is really a waste.   I am really disappointed by using your product, it is a waste one. I &#x60;ll never recommend any one to buy this, if this issue &#x60;ll not be taken care by REMINGTON.    Recently I had bought one(Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch) from USA by AMAZON. I was using in India and could use it only for 5mnts,and it went out of order.  Now I feel its waste of money.     Rabi  +91-9986362113</li>
    <li> I have always purchased a CHI straightener because I wanted my hair to look nice and smooth but I also wanted a straightener that could curl my hair.  All of my CHI&#x27;s stopped working within a year of purchasing them where they would just not turn on anymore.  I absolutely love this Remington it works so much better than any of my CHI&#x27;s for straightening and curling. IT&#x27;S AMAZING and way cheaper. The only con so far is it gives my hair static but with the right hair product this con is an easy fix. I do hit the buttons often with my hand when straightening but it seems to function just the same on any heat setting it accidentally switches to.</li>
    <li> I am loving this product. It lives up to all the hype as a top rated hairstyling tool according to Allure magazine. It heats up very quickly and my hair is still straight and managable 12 hours later. My only problem with it has been when I accidently touch the temperature control button as I am using it. I still have to figure out a better way to hold it. However, I would still highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is straight but needs help staying that way.  I purchased an inexpensive flat iron at a drugstore and it worked but I wanted shine so I went looking.  I found this one and purchased it.  It starts out at about 390 degrees but the increase heat button is right wear it&#x27;s held in the hand and it constantly gets pushed until it&#x27;s into the higher 400s.  It does not leave a shine but rather makes my hair quite dry.  I should have returned it but am keeping it just in case my cheapie one goes on the blink before I have time to look for a new one.</li>
    <li> I checked many reviews before i placed an order for this one..When i read that it almost works like a CHI i actually didn&#x27;t believe it but trust me it really works like a CHI Flat Iron.I am glad that i saved almost 70$ and bought a product of that quality. I  recommend this for every one.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron because my CHI seemed to be on it&#x27;s last leg.  I read the reviews and was very convinced that it would be better than my CHI.  Well, I tried it on my hair that same day and put it on the lowest heat and then was going to raise it if it wasn&#x27;t hot enough.  We all know that the CHI is one heat setting, knowing that it has never burnt my hair or broke it.  This flat iron burnt my hair and made it frizz up beyond control.  I had to rewash my hair and use my CHI!  I am not happy at all!</li>
    <li> i bought this straightener after reading all the positive reviews but i am very disappointed. it damaged my hair very bad just after using 3 times in lowest setting. i did not use it in a month even then my hair is not the same as it was. irreversibly damaged.</li>
    <li> Definitely 5 stars because it works great for a good price. It gets REALLY hot &amp; quick which is great for when I&#x27;m in a rush. It really keeps my hair straight all day even in humidity. Most straighteners have not done that for me, and they have cost me around the same, sometimes more. I&#x27;ve went through a lot of straighteners. This is by far the best for that price range. I found out about it when I straightened my hair at a friends house and I loved it. She had a Remington Shine Therapy straightener that they no longer make, I tried looking for it but found this newer &amp; improved version instead. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> First, let me start by saying that I NEVER write product reviews. Did I say NEVER?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being established, this is the most amazing product ever!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried every single flat iron imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;ve tried the Chi, Paul Mitchell, and all the other brand name, high dollar irons. But, none of them even compare to the technology in this one! No matter how high the heat setting, with all the other irons, any heat outside, humidity, rain, etc ruined my hair within SECONDS. I could literally have perfectly straight hair and walk outside and the ends would flip out or I would get frizzy, etc. It&#x27;s just about driven me to the brink of insanity and definitely made me believe that a QUALITY product existed on the flat iron market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll admit, I was super-skeptical - after all these bad experiences and money spent...I had almost given up and accepted that my hair would never be straight and pretty like other people&#x27;s. But, upon reading about this product and the reviews, I decided that another $40.00 wouldn&#x27;t kill me and if it didn&#x27;t work out, I knew Amazon would take it back - SOLD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day after I got it was a rainy day. So, I thought, what better way to test this thing. I read the instructions and followed them...also using flat iron spray to protect my hair (processed and damaged already). Immediately, I noticed that this flat iron was DIFFERENT! It glides through your hair like silk. Every other iron I&#x27;ve ever tried still had some sort of pulling effect on the hair, no matter how carefully you did it. This one was AMAZING. Okay, so I am impressed so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go out and run some errands in the light rain and I never use an umbrella. I went to get some groceries and parked a good distance from the store...walked in the rain both in and back out - which would have typically rendered my hairstyle an utter mess. Guess what? Still PERFECT - not a hair out of place, no curling, no frizz... exactly as it was before I left the comfort of my humidity-free home! Many hours later, as I write this, hair is still in the exact same style as it was when I first did it earlier today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought that it was just my hair - and it very well could be that my hair is just difficult and stubborn, like me! But, this iron proved to be tougher than my hair! It is without a doubt, the best money I have ever spent and I am now excited to do my hair as opposed to dreading having to undertake such a task. I have told my friends and recommended it to everyone today and will continue to do so. The four year warranty was also a huge plus - my other, more expensive and less effective irons had a one year warranty at best. One that I paid over $150 for, completely fell apart one day - with just normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very, very satisfied and impressed with this product. KUDOS to Remington for creating such a wonderful product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think that you&#x27;ve tried them all and a $40.00 flat iron would never work, much less surpass the others, think again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this item!!!my humidity-free home!

    <li> Honestly, my hair still reverts if the humidity levels are really high (90%) no matter what iron I am using, and I have used several brands. Also, a must have to keep my hair smooth is [[ASIN:B001AT5LEU Matrix Sleek Look Shampoo and Conditioner Duo (33.8 oz)]].  This product is a dream come true for unruly hair that does not want to cooperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S9951 Remington Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Straightens hair well, and it typically lasts longer(my hair is natural- no relaxer, and very frizzy)&lt;br /&gt;*Makes the hair shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*The flat iron tends to pull strands of hair out if you try to flat iron large sections of hair at a time. You have to do very small sections to avoid snagging the hair.&lt;br /&gt;* The flat iron really does not get as close to my hair roots as I would like. Blow drying my hair with a comb attachment has been great at getting my roots straight.</li>
    <li> Ordered this flat iron hoping to would be a great alternative to all the expensive brands.  The only problem was the on off button kept shutting itself off every time I turned it on.  It was very frustrating and so I had to return it.  Instead bought the Jilbere flat iron, it cost me more but, guess what...IT WORKS GREAT!</li>
    <li> We purchased the Remington S9951 for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.(She had been hinting for weeks )After reading the reviews I decided to purchase it. To my surprise it works great. My daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used many hair tools out there they straighten my hair and the next day I have to do it again because it doesn&#x27;t last or ends up frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Remington frizz and not only does  it straighten my hair it lasts for days. I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it, I was leary at first as I have purchased many hair tools that haven&#x27;t worked.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron after my old, cheap one finally died on me. After reading the reviews, I was impressed but really just needed a decent flat iron, not a miracle-worker. Well, after the first time using it, I wish I had replaced my old el-cheapo a LONG time ago! I have very thick, wavy hair and was worried that the plates wouldn&#x27;t be wide enough, but it didn&#x27;t really matter because I saved so much time in NOT having to run it down my hair multiple times, once or twice and the section was pin straight. Also, the fly-aways I was having were remedied and it really does make my hair feel softer! VERY IMPRESSED!</li>
    <li> This appliance styles well &amp; I have very thick, hard to manage, wavy hair. However, I find myself having to reset it multiple times while I style. I see why brands like the chi do not have these sensitive push buttons and go with the manual switch instead. That being said, I&#x27;m happy with the tool and am glad I didn&#x27;t spend double or triple on a more expensive one!</li>
    <li> An absolutely tremendous product! After years of fighting frizz in my coarse/wavy/curly hair, I am thrilled with the results from this iron. My hairdresser told me that the Gold Standard of frizz control is to use John Freida, frizz control serum on your wet hair, comb through and let dry naturally. This resulted in hair that was very smooth and shiny. Once dry, I used a straightening iron to finish it off. This has worked very well yet once exposed to humidity, the \\&quot;set\\&quot; was compromised. Now though, with the Remington, the \\&quot;set\\&quot;, smoothness and shine is maintained after being exposed to humid conditions. It has greatly reduced the frequency of \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot; and I&#x27;m thrilled not to have to put a hot ANYTHING to my hair very often! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I really like this flatiron!  It does get hotter than my old one(you can adjust the temperature too), so use a heat protective product when you style.  I have very curly hair, which normally means straightening every day; but my hair stayed straight for several days in a row, through sleeping on it and wearing a stocking hat in the cold.  I would definitely buy another. The order process went smoothly and the package came promptly and boxed well.</li>
    <li> The Remington flat iron has outdone all the flat irons I have used in the past from Hot Tools to Solia (equivalent to Chi or Sedu).  Along with the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, this one gets my approval too!    It left my hair frizz free even in many days worth of rain and high winds.  My hair also feels smooth and soft 3 days after ironing it.  I would recommend you use an anti-frizz treatment (I use John-Frieda) since you will be heating the cuticles of your hair.  But overall this one definetly is a keeper and well worth more than the $50 being paid for.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best flat iron I have ever used. I bought it to replace my old Remington flat iron (I had owned that iron for 3 years and just felt it wasn&#x27;t getting as hot as it used to though it still functioned perfectly) and am amazed at the quality and how great my hair looks. It does heat up quickly, I compared it to my older iron and it will be ready to go (at 430F) in minutes. My old Remington took a solid 5-7 minutes to reach the same temperature. I also wanted to check just how hot my old iron was getting compared to this new one. I measured the temperature and found that my old iron was barely breaking the 200s and did not heat evenly at all. This iron not only heated up quickly, but heated up to the appropriate temperature setting and most importantly, evenly. One of the other things I love about this iron is that your hair does not snag at ALL when you run it through. My old iron was constantly snagging and I was frequently having to pull out broken hairs that got caught in the plates. The construction of this flat iron is far superior. It is also lightweight without feeling cheap and is very comfortable to use. I like where the button placement is and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with it at all. Another thing I like it the secure hinge lock. This really is such a great quality iron. My hair is significantly more frizz free and and SO silky, the difference is worthy of a before and after pic. I have a lot of fine, wavy hair that is below my shoulders and I had no trouble doing my hair in under 10 minutes. I finished with a bit of Moroccan Oil and I was good to go. I highly recommend this and would repurchase in a second! I am so satisfied with the quality of Remington&#x27;s products and their reasonable price point that they are the only brand I consider for flat irons and curling wands.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener!! It cut down the time it took to straighten my hair by a ton! It heats up very fast as it advertises and stays hot while using it which many cheaper straighteners don&#x27;t. Usually I use remington straighteners in the $20-$30 price range but this was totally worth the extra money. It is especially great because it is so much cheaper than a lot of the &#x27;salon&#x27; quality expensive straighteners like chi etc. My hair also does stay straighter than it did with other straighteners and for a longer time which is amazing since my hair usuallu gets extremely frizzy at even the sight of water. Definitely recommend it!! bottom line: heats up in a minute or less, works fast, stays hot and keeps your hair straight for a long time!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is GREAT!  I have naturally wavy hair that is prone to the frizzies in humid weather.  I have used other flat irons, but usually end of frizzy by the end of the work day.  With this one, however, my hair is smooth and shiny, and stays that way all day.  The only \\&quot;con\\&quot; about this is that the controls for the temperature settings are right where your hand is, and it is too easy to accidently raise or lower the temp as you straighten your hair.  The instructions say that there is a way to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; the temp, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to work.  But that inconveience aside, you won&#x27;t regret getting this flat iron!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my flat iron for a while now &amp; it still works great! I use it once, sometimes twice a day. It has been the best flat iron thus far that I have owned. Others recommended the CHI but the original, authentic CHI costs more than $100. I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend that much but my aunt recommended this iron &amp; it works great! Heats up quickly, as stated. Roughly 30 seconds at the lowest setting (390 degrees) and about a minute for the higher settings. I&#x27;m skeptical about how it will do as an anti-humidity device. I live on the east coast so right now is our winter month but we will just see how it works in the summertime!</li>
    <li> The flat iron worked perfectly for about 3 weeks.  A couple of days after I threw away the packaging, it stopped getting hot.  A disappointment indeed.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after seeing its review in Good Housekeeping.  It really lives up to its positive review.  I have gotten many positive comments about my hair since receiving the Remington Frizz Control Flat Iron.  It works better than any other product I have used and keeps my hair smooth even on humid days.  It is a great bargain when you compare it to the price of a CHI!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;-The temperature can be locked during use by holding down the minus button, you will see a lock icon on the display.  This way if I accidentally hit one of the temperature buttons diuring use the temp does not change.&lt;br /&gt;-Gets my hair very straight.  Stays straight all week.&lt;br /&gt;-Heats quickly.&lt;br /&gt;-Decent price.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-None</li>
    <li> I am in love with this iron -- I finally found one that gets hot enough to straighten my very thick, very curly hair (ok, some might say frizzy) in one pass. I&#x27;m done in no time -- my old CHI could not do what this one does. Comfortable in the hand -- and for those who complained about the placement of the control buttons, read the directions. All you have to do is hold the minus (-) button for 3 seconds to lock the settings. This one&#x27;s a bargain at the $39 Amazon is charging for it.</li>
    <li> Amazing flat iron with the perfect heat and it does heat up fast btw. No complain at all i even used it with my BK treatment and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> Good flat iron. Only con is the temp control buttons are right where your thumb goes and is hit easliy when in use.</li>
    <li> The Remington flat iron is the best I have ever used to control frizz even in the worst humidity.   I have been using a Chi which pulled the ends of my hair and did not control the frizz.  I have even been to the beach and my hair stayed straight.  This iron is perfect for my short hair and heats up quickly.  It has different temps but the lowest temp works great.  I would definitely recommend this product for the quality and value.</li>
    <li> i bought this item from amazon recently and i am in love with it. it really makes the hair smooth and shiny with a little amount of time as compared to other straighteners it will not fight much towards the frizz as it says but it is pretty good</li>
    <li> I loved...loved...loved, the price was just right. I have a lot off hair, and always takes a while to get done, but with this flat iron, it is fast and efficient. I recommend this for yourself and as a gift.</li>
    <li> it is more than I expected...makes my hair easily straight..no much time needed...  I loved it..but it would be better if they put a CD in it, showing some different using styles..</li>
    <li> Today I got my flat iron. I am so happy it works fine.   My hair is beautiful, straight and very healthy.   I give 100% to this item.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review for anything but I just had to for this item. I used this flat iron on my natural hair and my hair looks just as silky smooth as it did when I had a relaxer. Hair gets completely straight with the first swipe (but I go over each section twice) and I was able to do my 3C/4A just-below-the-shoulder lenght hair in under 30 mintues. I did not use any type of product other than a hair oil mist and my roots are bone straight! My hair is straight, but not flat and has a bounce to it.   I can&#x27;t comment on how long the straight hair will last and may update later, but if the straight hair lasts three days I will be more than happy!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair iron I have ever owned! Heats up very quickly and does a Great job!!   I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the price and the other reviews. I guess it&#x27;s ok for the price but I&#x27;m tired of cutting off burned pieces of hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had a Chi, but I have coarse, wavy hair that is very thick. My hair was no match for this heavy hitter! One-pass straightening even for my hair. Amazing. It&#x27;s really a great little gadget!</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightener for a great price!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a Chi...this works just as good!</li>
    <li> i have had a few flat irons...even a CHI, which i was told was one of the best...well the REMINGTON S9951 is far better! it heats up fast and works fabulous! i just love it!</li>
    <li> I first read about this flat iron in Good Housekeeping magazine.  They claimed that it performed at 100% in all of their testing.  They put hair samples in a humidity controlled room for 15 hours and measured the frizz among samples treated with frizz serum and a regular flat iron and this iron with no product.  This product by itself won by far.  That was quite impressive so I decdided to give it a try.  I bought mine at Target for $49.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let me say that I have very fine textured hair that is a little below my shoulders so it is pretty easy to straighten with any flat iron.  My trouble has been that after an hour (even with product &amp; hairspray) it will become wavy again.  There was definitely a noticeable difference using this tool.  My hair did not frizz and stayed much straighter for a longer periid of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting, it heats up in about 60 seconds and beeps to let you know it has reached the desired setting.  You have to hold the power button down for a few seconds to turn it off which is helpful because I was always accidentally hitting it while straightening my hair on my old iron. Another plus, the heating plate rocks so that you don&#x27;t snag pieces of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!  I love it!</li>
    <li> When I used this product for the first time I noticed that it emited a pungent odor when on (before even using it on my hair). Even worse is the fact that when you run it through your hair it makes it smell like skunk.  The floating plates are really pointless and just seem like they were added to the product so Remington could justify the bloated price tag. I also echo the comments other reviewers have about this product making your hair look oily. Cannot recommend this product...</li>
    <li> I was so excited about getting this flat iron, since I usually pay more for my flat irons. I used to have the chi, and It was ok, but didn&#x27;t last long. Then I bought a solia, and wow.. I love that one. But then my kids droped it and it broke in half, so after reading the reviews I choose this one. Im not impressed at all...&lt;br /&gt;Yes it does the job, but my hair smells like burn after I use it, and this is every time I use it, is a weird smell, and it gets TOOOO HOT from the outside also... I can&#x27;t curl my hair without burning my fingers all the time. And my hair starts freezing very fast. After a while I got tired and went back to solia. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is the first flat iron that i have purchased that actually leaves my hair smooth.  Would highly recommend.  The price is excellent. I have  paid over $100.00 for flat irons that did not do as half as nice as this one.</li>
    <li> Just got it and tried it out, and I can tell that I&#x27;m going to love it!  Lots of bang for the buck, and the conditioning therapy is evident, too.</li>
    <li> I have natural black hair...I guess a mix between 4a and 4b. I never put heat on my hair, but I decided to straighten my hair for my graduation last month. I did a lot of research and finally purchased the Remington about a month ago. It straighten it really well, and I was even able to add some loose curls to it. My hair didn&#x27;t have a gross burnt smell afterwards and it did not frizz up in the hot sun during graduation day either. People complain about the temperature settings changing, but that can be controlled by simply pressing down the &#x27;-&#x27; button. My hair retained its curl pattern after I washed it, and I even recently used the Remington to straighten both of my little sisters&#x27; natural hair with similar results. Of course using a heat protecting spray is wise. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I felt guilty for giving this iron a bad review previously, so am back to edit now.  I previously said that I&#x27;d used this iron for 2 weeks and thought it weighed my hair down.  I&#x27;ve now used it for a few more weeks and I think what was weighing my hair down was the tresseme heat protector spray.  I only wash my hair every 3rd day, so I kept using that spray every day I ironed my hair.  I suppose that probably isn&#x27;t necessary (?) Now, I spray once, well, the 1st day, and then on the following days, I do not spray near the roots at all, but just a little on the ends and my hair is not weighed down as much.  It wasn&#x27;t this iron&#x27;s fault!  So I feel bad for saying it was ;(  Anyway, this iron heats up very quickly and beeps to let you know when it&#x27;s ready.  Also, you can lock the temperature in by just pressing the minus key and holding it down.  Some more expensive irons don&#x27;t have this feature and the temperature or power buttons are easy to hit when just trying to hold the iron.  The lowest setting is 300 degrees and I&#x27;ve found that even this temperature can straighten my hair and then i don&#x27;t risk as much damage.  But, I&#x27;ve had some help straightening it too.  I had a Brazilian Blowout 4 months ago, and I do straighten it as a blow-dry it too.I&#x27;ve been using this iron daily for 2 weeks now. I think the blowout may have worn out by now though!?  About.com says that the plates of this flatiron have a porous ceramic coating that actually emits a silicon-based conditioner and that the liquid inside it lasts about 4 years.  I wonder why they don&#x27;t put that on the outside of the box somewhere, or in the user manual inside the box?  I wonder if maybe they want customers to think the conditioning properties could last 4-ever?  Regardless of it being a good iron for the money, I&#x27;ve already ordered a different iron from amazon.com: BaByliss Pro BABNT3073T Nano Titanium Straightening Iron, only because the length of the plates on this one are so short, that I can&#x27;t get a good-sized chunk of hair in it without pieces falling off the ends of the plate.  I&#x27;m thinking I could possibly save time ironing my hair if I were able to straighten larger chunks of hair at a time!  As for drugstore irons though (I got mine at Target) - I&#x27;d say this is about the best one for the money that you&#x27;re going to find.ized chunk of hair in it without pieces falling off the ends of the plate.

    <li> I have had many Irons before, and I definitely have to say that this is the best one I have ever used.  The only thing to be careful of is that you need to keep your hand high on the handle when you use it.  If your hand is too low, you will either turn it off or change the heat setting on it.</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, frizz prone hair. Just got this from Amazon, plugged in it immediately to try it out..and WOW...heats up fast, easy to handle. I am REALLY impressed and will not spend another 150+ on a CHI. Traveling to Europe this week, happy to have a dual voltage flat iron that (hopefully) will not start smoking and melt like my Chi did on my last trip :)</li>
    <li> My frizzies were so bad that I was concidering chemical relaxing again after growing my hair back to natural over the last two years. Maybe my 4 year old, very expensive, flat iron wasn&#x27;t heating up enough any more. It wasn&#x27;t doing the job. The Remington S9951 straightens my hair in 1/4 the time and my hair stays straighter and less frizzy much longer. I can wear my hair down again if I want instead of pony tails and buns every day. Wonderful!</li>
    <li> I like that it is digital and can set exactly how hot you want it. I also like how smoothly it glides over your hair because my last one always pinched my hair (painful to use at times). A previous reviewer complained about hitting the controls and changing the temp when using it. If you hold down the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button it will lock the iron on the temp you&#x27;ve set it at. Press the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button again to unlock it. There was a typo on the instruction insert on how to do that. With a little practice, I could manage a curl on my bangs. Yes, it is slippery but practice practice practice.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful flat iron, I have very long curly, frizzy hair and this flap iron defiantly make it smooth and controls the frizz all day, I like it even better than my old flat iron which was a chi. It doesn&#x27;t snag or pull at your hair, and gets hot very quick!</li>
    <li> This is my first hair straighter so I do not have anything to compare it to. However for the price it does the trick, I still have Frizz using this product and it gets really hot so be careful when you are using it. Overall I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> It works really well, but I&#x27;ve just had it for a couple of weeks. I would purchase it again if I had to.</li>
    <li> I have never owned a flat iron. Based on the helpful reviews on this web site I decided to try it. I love it. It works great on my fine hair. I like the fact that it has different heat settings. Very happy with product. Love the price. It is better than a cheaps one and not as expensive as a CHI.</li>
    <li> The straightener does straighten my hair but you have to be really careful if you have bangs.  I senged my bangs really badly not knowing I had to turn the heat down. I have never had to do that with past straighteners that I have had.  As long as you lower the temperature setting for thinner parts it does just fine.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly.  I&#x27;m able to curl the ends nicely.  Straightens my hair nicely and lasts until my next wash (and I have very frizzy hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that when I am straightening my right hand side and using my left hand - that I regularly accidentally hit the buttons on the outside.  I havent done this with my previous hair irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A PRODUCT VERY GOOD, and if it has covered my expectations, I congratulate AMAZON AND THANKS TO SELL THINGS OF GOOD PROVENANCE</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Hotttt, It&#x27;s easy, but you need to make sure you don&#x27;t use a very big part of hair at a time.  I usually buy a flat iron and use it to do some touch ups here and there on my hair after I get it blow dried at the saloon since it usually starts to curl up again at the roots when it gets humid. I never tried to actually straighten my hair fully on my own because I just have a lottttt of hair that&#x27;s curly and frizzy, but when I received this Remington flat iron I thought to give my hair a try and it ACTUALLY WORKED. I was able to fully straight my hair all on my own. It took about an hour with a minute break here and there but it&#x27;s still great.  I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing the 2\\&quot; version of it, any one tried it???</li>
    <li> This flat iron is fantastic, especially for the price. The color is really cute, too. It has a wonderful grip on it, so it&#x27;s super easy to curve, bend, and flip hair, more than any other flat iron i&#x27;ve ever used. it heats up and cools down to the specific temp in seconds. it beeps when it hits that temp. there&#x27;s no little &#x27;hanger&#x27; piece to hang from a hook, so i just tied a loose little knot, and it works great. the lowest temp is 300 degrees, which works great for the more delicate hair around my face. it feels smooth, leaves a nice shine, as a great purchase. i have the keratin smoothing treatment, so i don&#x27;t specifically notice high shine or low friz, but it does work great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for just over a month and it is spectacular.  My hair in its natural state is very frizzy.  I can flat iron it straight, but heaven help me if it is humid or my hair gets damp during the day.  I go back to looking like a troll doll.&lt;br /&gt;I have loved how this product works since getting it...my hair is unbelievably soft, straight, and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;The true test, however, came this past week when we had a sudden, unexpected snow storm.  The snow was slushy and mixed with rain.  I tried hard to keep my hair covered as much as I could, but it ended up getting fairly wet at least three times that evening.  I expected it to frizz up, but it didn&#x27;t!  It stayed smooth and straight.  I simply waited for my hair to dry and then ran a fine comb through it.  I was so thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product I am able to simply wash my hair and go if absolutely necessary.  My hair is no longer ridiculously wild...rather, it has soft waves and curls that I can live with if I don&#x27;t have time to flat iron my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I give this product two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I recently lost my Sedu Revolution at a hotel, and I did not want to spend the $$ to replace it so I picked up this one at Walmart (it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon) because I needed something fast. I was surprised at how well it works - it heats up faster than my old, and gets to that 430 that I need for my very thick wavy hair. Only one pass over each section of hair is needed, just like my Sedu. And it really does seal the cuticle and leave it shiny and smooth. I&#x27;m so glad I gave this one a try before spending the big bucks on an expensive version.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because I actually really did like this straightener.  Unfortunately, after only 6 uses, it just quit working.  It won&#x27;t heat up and just shuts off.  But because I don&#x27;t straighten my hair that often, my warranty was expired by the time this happened.  This is my first negative experience shopping on Amazon.  I gave the product 2 stars since I did like it when it worked.  I would gladly remove this review if the company would replace the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a typical straight iron. I don&#x27;t see any difference that my hair has been infused with conditioner at all. I have thick, wavy, long hair and I was dreid out and frizzy just like when I use cheap ones. It does heat up fast, though, which is a redeeming quality.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser highly recommended this straighter. I could not find it in the stores but I knew Amazon would have it. I actually like it better than my Chi.</li>
    <li> Purchased this flat iron for my daughter (who has really long, naturally curly hair) last Xmas as a gift. I was spending $100+ for the \\&quot;good\\&quot; flat irons, and when mine broke I used hers. This flat iron worked better than those that cost 3 times as much. Temperature is pre set at 390, and I use at 360 and turn it off right before I straighten bangs and hair around my face.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron; however the lock broke a week after the deadline to return to Amazon. I am not happy, as the lock provides protection from the heat when not in use (e.g. when it&#x27;s cooling) and makes the iron lie flat for travel.    This is the first time I&#x27;ve had issues with an Amazon purchase, and I am a Prime member. I can&#x27;t believe there is no option for recourse than returning for partial refund or writing a review.     Alas, I&#x27;ve chose the latter.</li>
    <li> My hair is course, dry and frizzy... always high maintenence.I usually have my hair done at the salon in order to look decent but started to research flat irons in order to save money. After reading the reviews of many products I decided on this item. I have been so pleased with it. I get more compliments on my  hair styling now than I did when I was going to the salon every week.  You must practice to get just the right look . I found that wrist action works best.. shaping hair up or under. The iron is very effecient and if you don&#x27;t \\&quot;style\\&quot; correctly your hair may stick out all over. Also, less is better. Don&#x27;t over straighten.  Be patient and you will be so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> PROS:  It really does hold up well to humidity, just as it claims.  The conditioner does give the hair a nice shine.  It also heats up very fast.    CONS:  The buttons are placed so that it is difficult to avoid changing the settings or turning the iron off (so there is some minor annoying beeping).  The conditioning stuff can leave the hair looking greasy if you are like me  and only wash your hair 2x/week as needed.  This conditioner requires me to shampoo my hair every day now.  Ugh!  Finally, the iron also makes my hair look very flat which, in all fairness, could be due to user error.    I am pleased it does exactly as it claims.  I am displeased I look awful with my hair styled as such.        I will be keeping the iron so that I can use it on my next hair style.    I also wonder how long the styling conditioner will last and if there is any replacement conditioner.</li>
    <li> I like it because you don&#x27;t have to go over your hair more than twice to get it straight. I have medium-long,curly, frizzy hair. It still doesn&#x27;t make my ends look polished and when I wake up the next morning my hair is no longer straight, which other flat irons have done. I think knowing that it is not as damaging to my hair helps in picking this one over other flat irons.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used a flat iron and I am extremely pleased with the performance of this iron.&lt;br /&gt;First, I used this on my daughter&#x27;s hair which leans toward thin but has some frizziness to it. The results were just beautiful! Her hair is just below her shoulders and took less than 10 minutes to run the iron through her hair at a medium temperature. She loved the look! Her hair looked and felt like silk after using the iron.&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on my hair which is thick and processed from dying. While I do not dye my hair every month, my hair is course, frizzy and it is hard to maintain a smooth look.&lt;br /&gt;It took me maybe 15 minutes at the highest setting to run the iron though my hair and I just was amazed at the results! The style stayed all day and my look even made it through sleeping! My hair was straight, smooth and the softest I have ever had it; I couldn&#x27;t stop touching it all day.</li>
    <li> This is a great iron! I got it as a present and could not be happier. I love that it has a button lock as the buttons are right where your hand holds the iron. The iron gets really hot really quickly, and beeps to let you know it is at the correct tempurature. I have slightly fine hair and have to use it on 300. It has spring loaded plates which helps to keep your hair from getting stuck. I have also noticed it definately helps with the frizz and make my hair smooth and shiny for quite a while. I wouls definately recommend this.</li>
    <li> This had good reviews so I got it for my girlfriend, who already had one, but it was worn out and no longer did a great job. This one heats up quickly and is a breeze to use. She straightens her hair in a few minutes. The only drawback is the digital display on the one we received is messed up and looks to be in Martian or something.</li>
    <li> The only reason I purchased this was because of the reviews (well, price too).   I am a pretty faithful Chi user, have tried other irons and have never been happy, so I didn&#x27;t expect much.   Wow, was I wrong!  This iron works much better than my Chi;  my hair glides right through, straightens beautifully, and I only have to straighten each section once.   I can&#x27;t wait to see if it really helps frizz in more humid weather, but regardless, I am VERY pleased with this iron!!!!!</li>
    <li> So far, this product has worked very well for me. I have very curly hair and I was able to straighten it in about a half hour. Pretty Sweet!</li>
    <li> This is a must of you have thick hard to straighten hair. This does a far better job than getting it flat ironed at the salon! Good bang for the buck too!</li>
    <li> PROs: Inexpensive - $40 or less; Heats up quickly; Dual-Voltage 120/240V    CONs: Temperatures can be too hot; No temperatures in the 200 degrees range; Does not come with a pouch    This flat iron for less than $40 was a terrific purchase especially for international travel.  I had to purchase a dual-voltage flat iron for traveling in Europe, since the one I was using (cost over $100) cannot be used overseas.     The flat iron heats up quickly within 10 seconds or less to 320 degrees. Temperature starts from 390 degrees when plugged into the outlet. One can decrease temperature to 300 degrees or increase it to 430 degrees with eight different degree temperatures.  Just wish it had some lower temperatures in the 200 degrees range. With thick/coarse hair, 300 to 320 degrees temperature did a fantastic job. Have not tried higher temperatures since there&#x27;s no need to. This flat iron does a better job than the expensive flat iron. My hair felt softer and looked shiner after using the Remington.    For international traveling, use the international adapter plug for the country you&#x27;re visiting. Meaning, you do not need a bulky converter. Traveled through Western Europe with no problem and highly recommend this flat iron to anyone wanting to buy a durable, but inexpensive hair iron.</li>
    <li> Straightener turns off while heating up; would have to keep turning it back on, and after several times it will finally stay on.  Once heated up the straightener works very well (comparable or possibly even superior to the CHI I replaced).  Contacted Remington, and they are going to provide me with a new one, and will cover all costs of shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m taking a trip to Europe at the end of May and had read that Chi flat irons do not work in Europe - I confirmed this in the instruction manual that I still had.  I searched and searched for an affordable dual voltage flat iron  and came across this flat iron in a travel blog.  I decided to take a chance since the price was right and the reviews on Amazon were good.    While I haven&#x27;t left for my trip yet, I did want to try out this flat iron before leaving.  Honestly, this flat iron was less than half the price of my Chi and it straightened my hair just as well.  I have fine curly hair which can frizz up like crazy, but this flat iron had no problem smoothing my hair out.  I used the same temp that I use on my Chi (370 degrees).  I did snag my hair a few times initially, which is extremely annoying and painful, but once I got used to using a new iron and slowed down a little the snagging stopped.  I find that snagging is a problem in cheaper flat irons that I&#x27;ve bought - this never occurs with my Chi though.    Also, I read a good number of reviews of about people hitting the buttons while flat ironing.  If you read the directions it tells you how to lock the buttons; however, the instructions are incorrect.  They instruct you to hold the \\&quot;+\\&quot; button for the 3 seconds to lock and hold the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for 3 seconds to unlock - TOTALLY WRONG!  To lock the buttons you need to hold down the \\&quot;-\\&quot; button for a few seconds, then you&#x27;ll see a lock symbol appear on the screen, repeat to unlock the buttons and the lock symbol will disappear.    REVIEW UPDATE 6/9/11:    This flat iron worked fabulously in Europe (UK, France, Italy).  It heats up ridiculously fast - even faster than my Chi - and is very compact and easy to travel with.  I especially like that you can lock the plates so it makes for easy storage in your suitcase and even on tiny bathroom counters.  This flat iron does exactly as it says and gets your hair straight, straight, straight.  I can flat iron my hair much faster with this iron than with my Chi.    Would I toss my Chi for this flat iron?  NOPE.  Here&#x27;s why:  This flat iron actually does TOO good of a job straightening hair and gets my hair a little straighter than I&#x27;d like.  I&#x27;ve tried turning down the heat, but same effect - too straight.  Girls with curly hair will know what I&#x27;m taking about - I get that look where you can TELL that I have curly hair and I flat iron it.  It just doesn&#x27;t look natural. It&#x27;s like Mariah Carey hair where it has no texture or volume to it and it looks a little stiff, if that makes any sense.  It&#x27;s still a great flat iron and worked beautifully in Europe and even at home, but I prefer my hair to look a little more natural.      Girls looking for stick-straight hair will LOVE this flat iron.  I still don&#x27;t regret my purchase and will take it with me the next time I visit Europe.  A great flat iron at an amazing price - your satisfaction will just depend on the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
    <li> I was so surprised this works so well for the price.  It made a huge difference in my big 80&#x27;s hair.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair straightner. I bought it at the local Walmart and I have had it for a little over a year, and it still works just a well. The iron hits up quite fast (within 60 seconds) and you can get it pretty hot. Also it has an automatic shut off. The only thing I have a problem with is just when youre holding it you can sometimes press the heat buttons and make it turn down on accident. But other than that little problem I would most defenitly reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my second Remignton Flat iron (my sister kept the other one) and it works amazing, it gets hot in a couple of minutes and it makes your hair straight in less than that! I like it better than my old one!</li>
    <li> Love my NEW Flat Iron. My hair feels so soft and so silkly the shine and the body it now has.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this flat iron.  It heats up quickly and works better than my \\&quot;overpriced\\&quot; and \\&quot;expensive\\&quot; irons I&#x27;ve owned in the past. Once in a while, I hit the temp button and change the temp of the iron, but it&#x27;s just something I&#x27;ve figured out after using it a few times.  Works great on my 6yo daughter&#x27;s hair which does not hold a curl with other irons.</li>
    <li> Product I purchased is excellent. Exactly what I wanted and needed. Just got a keratin treatment and it requires to use a flatiron. this was a great priced item!</li>
    <li> This straightener works really well at taming frizz and smoothing coarse hair but mine broke within a month of purchasing it. It is a cheap design unfortunately. I would steer away from it if you want your product to last. My friend had less problems with hers but it still broke before she had had it a year.</li>
    <li> After reading several reviews, I decided to try this straightener, and I was very pleased with how well it straightened my hair (I have fairly thick, frizzy, wavy hair). It did a better job at straightening than my other straightener and it keeps it pretty smooth :) For the price, I haven&#x27;t found a better product.  I will probably buy another one to have handy for when this one eventually dies on me.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron many months ago after reading the good reviews on here.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t work miracles.  If you don&#x27;t protect your hair before using it, your hair will be damaged.  I&#x27;ve got the split ends and sad burned hair to prove it.  It works so much better than my old one, though.  It does keep my hair straight for two days.  (I usually try to only wash my hair every other day because of the damage it&#x27;s suffered.)  It smooths very nicely over the hair, doesn&#x27;t pull at it like my last iron.  I have crazy hair that flips out and under however it feels like, and this does the trick.  Just remember to protect your hair!  I use Aveda Glossing Straightener after applying Damage Control daily repair.  I have dark brown shoulder length hair, if that helps.  This combo makes my hair feel very smooth and silky, and men like it.  :)&lt;br /&gt;My sister&#x27;s iron just broke, and she asked if she could use my old one.  Lucky for her I couldn&#x27;t find it, and I ordered her one of these irons via Amazon 1-click mobile.  :)  I know she&#x27;ll like it as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had at first was that to lock onto the temp you&#x27;ve chosen, you have to press and hold the middle button.  The directions say something else, which doesn&#x27;t work.  I do really like that you can select which temp you want to use.  I&#x27;ve learned to turn it down more because it still works on the lower heat settings.</li>
    <li> The Remington Shine Therapy Frizz Control is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve bought.  Enough of those $100+ ones the hair salons sell and all the other cheaper ones at the store.  I have very thick hair and this one tames it down by far, and no frizz even when I am in tropical weather!  I used to wash my hair every day because of wild hair....no more!  This product gets my highest recommendation!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best flat iron ever...!!!!! EVER!!!! I love how cheap it was and trust all the reviews it is an amazing flat iron, I do my hair TWICE a Week and I have relaxed curly curly hair (The African American hair gene), is unbelievable... They way It makes my hair smooth and it doesn&#x27;t burns it at all... Trust me I&#x27;ve gotten more burns in my hair salon and this is always smooth on me... I LOVE THE WAY MY HAIR LOOKS.... I always use the lower setting 300 degrees (I dont even want to try the higher settings) but so far it heats up almost instantly and is so friendly I love you flat iron!!!!</li>
    <li> This thing is the best!  I have frizzy hair especially in humidity.  This controls my hair, keeps it straight for a long time.  It has a digital temp, and easy buttons.  I wish the lock button would be a little better like my wet to dry iron. but otherwise works like a dream</li>
    <li> In the past I have never been able to use any heat on my hair without it frizzing out of control.  I&#x27;ve been using this flat iron for months and I can now straighten and/or curl my hair without any product or frizz.  And it&#x27;s so affordable!  I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it.  The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that my hair is not as naturally curly as it used to be, which is fine with me!  And my hair seems to have lightened up in color since I started using it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002LIXTFC Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control, Humidity Resistant Ceramic Flat Hairstyling Iron, 1 Inch]]  I researched this as I always do with any product...hoping to find something less expensive than my Chi. I have course white hair that has a wavy mind of its own, usually requiring repeated passes with an iron.  I had just thrown out a review-recommended Conair Infiniti that  never really  seemed to do the job, was too heavy and even singed my hair a bit. I was a bit skeptical about this Remington, but it gets \\&quot;salon hot\\&quot; up to 430 degrees, very quickly. It&#x27;s light, is an attractive silver blue, has a large, visible readout--best of all, easily and efficiently irons out  kinky, frizzy hair. I straighten and curve with it, and it works well for both. Easily to manipulate because it has \\&quot;cool ends\\&quot;. It really does seem to condition the hair. My hair is silky and shiny. We will see if the plates hold up over time, but at this price, if it lasts a year or two, I&#x27;m satisfied.  The only negative I can find is that the buttons and led readout are right where one holds the iron...I tried to hold it higher, so I didn&#x27;t hit the buttons that change the temperature or turn it off, but it&#x27;s just not comfortable held any other way. The buttons could be a different design. However, the manual does give directions on locking in the temp so you don&#x27;t accidentally change it during use. Because... where else could the controls go? There was a typo, though! One must hold the MINUS button down for 3 seconds, until a tiny lock icon appears in the readout window. Then the buttons will be locked, so it doesn&#x27;t matter if your hand grips them. ( the manual contains a typo, indicating that the + button is to be held for 3 seconds, but it IS the - button that both locks AND unlocks the controls.)  With all this plus auto-shutoff in an hour, it&#x27;s a nice product, good value, I really like that it is so light. Normally, it takes a while to rest my arm from ironing, but this was a breeze! Stayed as ironed, overnight, too. This iron doesn&#x27;t include a heatproof bag but I have one from a previous iron. This one cools down so fast, I guess the manufacturer thinks a bag is not necessary. Oh the plates can be locked when stored, so you don&#x27;t have to wrap it with the cord to keep it compact.</li>
    <li> OMG this flat iron is perfect. I got it a few days ago and flat ironed my hair two days ago...it&#x27;s still needle straight and I am getting lots of compliments about how great my hair looks. Most persons keep asking for my hair stylist number, thinking its saloon styled.  It doesn&#x27;t take more than one pass for my hair to get it very straight and it last so long. I am in love. Thus far no complaints, considering I was willing to purchase a chi for plus $120. At $39.99 it was a steal of a deal for me.  By the way, the technology is perfect for the tropics. Great job Remington!!!</li>
    <li> So I did a bunch of research on which straighter I wanted. I&#x27;m really glad I bought this one. It works super well and its really easy to use. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair everyday or anything but when I do, it works perfectly.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I have very super curly hair. This puppy straightens and styles in no time, and really helps prevent frizz, but adds like a slight coating to the hair, which is fine by me. It&#x27;s just like normal hair product, and my hair was straight for four days and only required touch ups as I styled my pouf, ie the top layer needed a little smoothing out. I love it and it saves me tons of time, requiring only one half hour to completely straighten my super curly locks then lasting through four days, and 2 powder shampoos.</li>
    <li> I just got my flatiron today which I just ordered last week friday. I read the previous reviews about it and the price was just right. Im glad I bought this product because I love keeping my hair sleek and shiney.Very pleased and happy with my flatiron and Remington is a brand that everyone should use. Thank you Remington and thank you Amazon for being cost effective, delivery effective and a wonderful place to shop!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend (birthday present), who absolutely loved it! BUT, the straightener stopped working during her 3rd or 4th use!! There was a noise and the display&#x27;s fuse went off! The straightener still works but there is no way of telling what temperature it is stuck at, whether the +/- controls work or not!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Return period ended on Oct 31st, I am willing to pay for shipping, can the seller please replace the product with a new one? Says I am no longer eligible for a complete refund!</li>
    <li> I have been using it for more than a year now. Love this product!! Heats up fast and gives a nice frizz-free shine to my hair (medium-thick). The best part is that it does not make my hair look thin-straight. It has a healthy shine to them and maintain the thickness. Oh, and it takes me like 5 minutes to get it done (may be lesser once you have more practice).  Update: It&#x27;s been a couple of years now, and it still works great :)</li>
    <li> remington s9951 shine therapy frizz control...is an amazing product!!! i am 100% statisfied! it makes my hair very shiny and definitely controls frizz.  i get compliments about my hair all the time, because my hair looks so healthy!</li>
    <li> I read about this flat iron in Good Housekeeping, and it does all it promises! I have tried a few different flat irons, and none have worked as good as this one has. My hair can be wavy and frizzy, and this straightens it to look really sleek and it stays that way all day!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift this Christmas after my CHI straightener broke after 4 years. I have wavy/curly hair that when straightened, would not stay that way for long. After reading the reviews and putting this on my wish list, I tried it for the first time.   My hair stayed straight even after sleeping on it. My curly hair never stays straightened for more than 4 hours and this straightener kept it straight over night. I usually wake up with a birds nest!  I really like that you can control the temperature and it only takes 30 seconds to warm up. The only downside is that it does not come with a heat proof case, but after throwing out my CHI I just store it in the old case.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have the Remington Wet 2 Style 2\\&quot; model, and really like it.  After reading the glowing reviews for this iron, I decided I couldn&#x27;t go wrong (I&#x27;m looking for a 1\\&quot; that I can also use to curl)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this flat iron this week and unfortunately will be returning it on Friday.  Let me tell you why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The information on the Remington products website (and this website) indicate that this is a dual voltage flat iron.  I was specifically looking for a flatiron that I could use in Europe.  The downloadable manual for this flat iron on the Remington products website also indicates dual voltage and shows that it is 120V/240V.  Perfect for my needs.  However, when I finally freed this flat iron from the plastic and cardboard and tape prison that it was trapped in and checked both the iron itself (the black on black writing that is difficult to read) as well as the manual, I found no indication anywhere of dual voltage or 240V capability.  The manual that comes with the iron is different than the one on the RP site, although the model number is the same.  Strike One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  This flat iron doesn&#x27;t run smoothly over my hair and doesn&#x27;t straighten well (I have wavy, thick hair).  Instead, it gets &#x27;caught&#x27; and I ended up with those &#x27;flat iron&#x27; horizontal lines (or indentations) down the length of my hair.  It also doesn&#x27;t curl very well (and my hair curls pretty easily).  Not pretty, and Strike Two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The second time (SECOND!) I turned this flat iron on, it turned itself off within seconds.  I tried again.  And again. And again.  Each time, it stayed on for about 15 seconds and then turned itself off.  Finally, I got it to stay on long enough to heat up; I turned the heat up to 390 to see if it would work better, and locked the buttons successfully.  While using the iron, I noticed that it was no longer locked and had increased to 415 degrees.  These types of issues resulted in Strike Three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, the rule is three strikes and you&#x27;re out.  I&#x27;ll be returning this iron this week.  Not sure how so many people have had miraculous results with this iron; maybe you need to have extremely curly hair for it to work?  Or maybe Remington has changed the model in the past few months.  Who knows?  All I know is it&#x27;s going back.</li>
    <li> I love this Flat Iron.  I previously owned a CHI before this Remington, however&lt;br /&gt;the Remington has nicer features and it&#x27;s HALF THE PRICE !&lt;br /&gt;I like that it heats up very fast - you can SELECT the heat temp you want&lt;br /&gt;and can lock it &#x27;closed&#x27; when you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick/wavy/coarse hair..this flat iron quickly straightens my hair - leaves it&lt;br /&gt;silky - shiny and lasts all day...LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars only because I would have preferred the heat settings to be&lt;br /&gt;in a different location rather than on the handle close to where you hold it.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this product from here. I bought mine from Walmart and paid 15 dollars for it. I am an African American and I have stopped perming my hair recently so it is very very kinky. I have to flat iron it for it to look decent. I had some pink Conair flat irons that work great and I also put lots of hair serum on my hair so that it can lay down. I just used these new flat irons today for the first and it looks like i have just left the salon.The conditioners that it emits during styling really helps also because I did not use one bit of biosilk and my hair is silky straight and bouncy. These are the best flat irons hands down.I wish I could show you guys a picture of my hair. I also have Chi and they do not work as well as these.Get these flat irons ASAP!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews so this is my first product review. I just wanted to say that I returned the Remington S9500 pearl infused plates for this one. I have straight hair starting from the roots but the ends of my hair kind of curls slightly (not those springy tight curls). This I believe is due to the cut of my hair. I haven&#x27;t gotten a hair cut in almost a year so the un-layered hair from the top is creating more volume as it grows longer which I don&#x27;t particularly like. I thought flattening my hair would reduce the appearance of volume and I&#x27;ve always wanted pin straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Remington pearl straightener at Target that recently came out after I read the reviews for it. It was cheaper than the Remington anti frizz that&#x27;s for sure. I tried it out and wasn&#x27;t quite satisfied with the results. My hair was straight but it felt dry and stiff, not soft at all, and didn&#x27;t exactly &#x27;flow.&#x27; The temperature setting was on default. I only tried the product 3 times but I was already debating on whether I should just keep it or try the anti frizz one. The Remington pearl was the first straightener I&#x27;ve tried so there was nothing to compare to. However, I had a nagging feeling that I would be more satisfied with the anti frizz straightener (even though it looked bulkier) and I was right. I had to fork over an extra $10 at Target but I think it was worth it. The setting was at default temp but I noticed that steam comes out when I run it through my hair, something that I didn&#x27;t see when I tried the Remington pearl. My hair is now smooth, straight, soft, and shiny. When I feel the ends of my hair it feels wispy and flows like water out of my hands ^__^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I used Tresemme Heat tamer spray when I used the flat irons</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron.  I have thick, somewhat wavy hair and it both straightens it very well and also makes it very soft and silky.  It heats up very fast and is a well-made product. I can see how the buttons may be a bit oddly placed but I have not had a problem with them. Although I have used the CHI and think it may do a slightly better job, for half the price this one is definitely a better deal.</li>
    <li> My daughter requested a flat iron for Christmas and I was also looking for a new one. I have thick, naturally curly hair and liked what I read about how well the Remington S995 straightens this type of hair. As other reviewers have said it maintains its heat which straightens thick, curly hair much, much faster. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly and I&#x27;ve always wanted straight hair. The old flatirons did nothing, they wouldn&#x27;t even straighten much and my hair would immediately frizz up once I went outside. It was only when the irons came out with high heat and ceramic plates that it had any effect. But they also caused a lot of damage, especially since my hair is fine as well as curly. I had read a lot of reviews on this flatiron and decided to give it a try.     It&#x27;s fantastic! The infused avocado oil plates make my hair shiny for the first time ever. And it stays fairly straight, even in the foggy Bay Area where I live. For the price, this iron beats out many of the higher priced $100++ models.    I would have given this flatiron 5 stars, but there is just one design issue I&#x27;ve noticed. The ends of the plates tend to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; your hair and you can end up either breaking or pulling out some strands if you&#x27;re not careful about keeping the hair section stictly in the middle of the iron. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with the more expensive models. If Remington could resolve that problem, this iron would beat all others hands down.</li>
    <li> I found this iron quite by accident after reading in Instyle magazine about a $300 flat iron that you put oil in and since I didn&#x27;t want to spend that much I thought I&#x27;d try this one instead.  I am a caucasian female with course, naturally curly hair that is of course prone to be dry and frizzy and this iron really helps add shine to my hair even without product in it, without relaxers or keratin treatments though during high humidity days my hair still reacts but not nearly as much as it used to in fact I like this so much I bought a Remmington Frizz control jumbo 1.5\\&quot; barrel curling iron as well to go with it.  I HIGHLY recommend this iron.</li>
    <li> Smooths, shines, straightens and STAYS THAT WAY! love the product, it takes away my frizz in no time. almost like magic</li>
    <li> I am Black with mostly 3A curl pattern and a Brazilian blowout. I was looking for a replacement to my 6 year old iron that broke its spring. It was an ION brand and I really liked the smoothing I got from that iron. But I wanted to try something new and so I was interested in this (Remington) iron because of the humidity resistance and frizz control features. Even though it didn&#x27;t tote Ionic capabilities, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I thought I could use it to touch up my roots between Brazilians and still have some humidity control on my untreated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t noticed any extra frizz control or humidity resistance as a result of using it. But, it still does the job of a flat iron (e.g. smoothing and straightening my hair) on the default heat setting, which is a plus for me. I can&#x27;t judge the shine factor because my Brazilian already provides shine. It&#x27;s not as smoothing as my ionic was, but it still does a beautiful job. I&#x27;ll keep it until it gives up the ghost! It&#x27;s also light weight and easy to maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple complaints-&lt;br /&gt;The floating plates feature means, as others have said, I often get my hair caught in the space between and it snags my hair. I have to be very careful not to let any section I&#x27;m working on fall on the sides near the plate edges. That does get a little annoying and of course means unwanted breakage. But it is easily avoided by paying attention and working with a smaller section at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little plastic ring where the base of the iron and cord meet recently broke. I think I can easily super glue it back on. I&#x27;m not certain what caused it to break, I just one day noticed the ring sliding down the cord. I don&#x27;t know if this has any bearing on the performance of the iron at all. I think it was just a little decorative finishing feature to cover the cord, but still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I will share concerning the buttons- I accidentally discovered that if you hold down the \\&quot;temp down\\&quot; button for about 4 seconds, it will lock the other buttons. You&#x27;ll actually see a little lock symbol on the display. Once it&#x27;s locked you can press the buttons all day long and they won&#x27;t change. So for those who had complaints about accidentally pressing the buttons while you&#x27;re styling, this will prevent that issue. Once you&#x27;re done, you simply hold down the \\&quot;temp down\\&quot; button again for another 4 seconds and the buttons will work again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, don&#x27;t let the reviews about the buttons being in a bad place turn you away. If you like the other stats about it, you&#x27;ll probably be satisfied with this iron.utton for about 4 seconds, it will lock the other buttons. You&#x27;ll actually see a little lock symbol on the display. Once it&#x27;s locked you can press the buttons all day long and they won&#x27;t change.

    <li> I mean I&#x27;ve used flat irons before but this one is the top so far. I love the color and I love the result, I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve used. It made my hair silky smooth with no frizz and took less than half the time than my older straightener to finish my hair fully. And I have long wavy hair that is thick. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get my Remington S9951 flat iron. I ordered Friday and received it in the mail by Saturday. I am an African American woman, and I do put relaxers in my hair and right now I have 3 inches of new growth, in other words I am way overdue for another relaxer.(lol) This product makes my hair so straight I was so amazed. This is a wonderful product for natural, kinky, and coarse hair. So ladies of color, if you are looking for something like this please invest, it is only $40.</li>
    <li> Love this Iron! heats up fast. get very hot (need to actually lower). Like the lock button, so you don&#x27;t make hotter/cooler by accident. My daughter loves to. We both have curly/frizzy hair. Would buy again!</li>
    <li> This has been a great purchase.  Nice being able to adjust heat for different hair.  Stays clean, heats up fairly fast but not instantly.  I owned this for at least 6 months with no issues.  I would certainly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It seems to work pretty well but it&#x27;s very hard not to press the control buttons while using it. If the buttons were on the side instead of the top, I would have given this a better review.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product two weeks ago, used it twice, and I just went to use it and it didn&#x27;t turn on. I tried different outlets and nothing. What a waste of money!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I got this almost one year ago and I use it regularly. So far- its been great. It heats up really quickly, the temperature controller is good and the auto on-off means I dont need to worry about switching it on-off every 5 mins. The only complaint I have is that the entire unit sort of heats up if you use it for more than 30 minutes and then you cant hold it close to the plates. The handles get pretty hot. But apart from that, its awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever owned!  I have very coarse, wavy hair that is very hard to tame, especially in high humidity.  This straightener smooths and polishes my hair.  My hair looks so healthy.  Great product, and you cannot beat the price.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works so much better than any of the previous ones I have had.  I have thick hair and it never stands the humidity.  This flat iron heats quick and has an indicator to tell you when it is ready.  Easy shut off.  The only down side is I often hit the buttons while ironing my hair.</li>
    <li> If you typically wash your hair Daily, then this is an AWESOME flat iron.  BELIEVE all the reviews regarding the serum, and its ability to leave your hair smooth and silky ... and in need of shampoo the following day.  I love the way it feels.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or break my hair.  It heats quickly and works flawlessly.  I just wish the serum could be turned on and off.  If they&#x27;d add a little button so you could opt for the serum or not ... this would be the perfect iron.    I came back tonight to purchase the other Remington, because I figured if this one is this good (except for the serum), then I&#x27;m going with another Remington.  Unfortunately, I tried to save a little money by purchasing this one on eBay, and now I can&#x27;t return it.  I&#x27;ll keep it and use it on days when I know I&#x27;ll be washing my hair again the next morning.</li>
    <li> I bought the wife a $120+ FHM (or something close to that) straightener 1.5 yrs ago.  It just died.  I got her this one and she turned up her nose b/c it wasn&#x27;t a $100+ \\&quot;salon\\&quot; unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s used it a couple times and has gone from not wanting to return it (return thoughts based on brand name only) to really liking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
    <li> I have very THICK hair and it gets very FRIZZY in the summer time. It was so bad that people from work suggested buying a flat iron. The one I already had didn&#x27;t work at all, so I bought this Remington one. It works GREAT. No more frizz and it only takes a few minutes to do my whole head. I LOVE it!!</li>
    <li> I really like this flat iron, it only takes one swipe to get my hair straight. The claim of controlling frizz can be trusted because believe me when water and my hair mix, it ain&#x27;t a pretty thing. Using this flat iron has really cut down on the frequency and number of times I need to use it on my hair after a wash.  OK, the but...part.  The controls are located right where the user needs to grip it so I am constantly changing the temperature on accident, which is annoying.  If you move your hands further down, the grip isn&#x27;t strong enough. Higher and you get burnt.  Ouch!! Perhaps the manufacturer will take note and remedy this problem.  Other than that (which was enough to make me send it back once before, and changing my mind because it worked so well) I loved it.  Hope this helps! ~Sha</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this item. My hair frizzes and curls as the slightest bit of humidity, and finally I don&#x27;t have to worry about that so much. This flat iron hasn&#x27;t been fail-proof: on especially humid days inside the school where I taught, my hair didn&#x27;t look as straight or smooth. On the whole, however, I do not regret this purchase at all. It glides through my hair easily and has definitely made a difference in how my hair looks throughout the day. I would buy it again for the price it is, but I am also interested in finding an affordable chi down the road to see if that produces the same (or better) results and also cuts down on the time I spend straightening my hair. My only complaints are minor: (1) every once in a while I accidentally adjust the heat while straightening, but this is infrequent, and it beeps to let me know I&#x27;ve changed the temp so I just quickly readjust it; (2) the iron has started to fade/discolor on the bottom. I&#x27;m not sure why this is and it hasn&#x27;t affected performance any, but it is surprising since the iron is only a few months old.  One other thing worth mentioning is that I purchased item along with the HSI flat iron so I could compare them both, and I was much happier with this iron. It was more comfortable to grip and produced longer lasting results. I felt that the HSI iron took much too long to use because of how uncomfortable it was to grip and because of how many times I had to go over the same section of hair to get it straight.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron! My hair is pretty frizzy and this make it smooth and shiney. It glides so easily on my hair which doesn&#x27;t get stuck in it like the less expensive straighteners.  The results last all day and hopefully will when summer comes along.</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best I have ever had. I bought it in 2011 and it&#x27;s still working very well for me. I used to have Chis but they would give up working much sooner than they should for the price I paid. This straightener both straightens hair and also makes it look shiny and healthier. It is one of the best buys I have ever made and my friends rave on about how healthy and smooth it makes their hair look when they use it.</li>
    <li> This is so great. I have very few breakages and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz up as much as with other irons.</li>
    <li> My sister loves this flat iron! As do I&lt;br /&gt;I have other friends who prefer this flat iron over the chi and Paul Mitchell flat irons. Give it a try, for the price why the hell not?!</li>
    <li> *3/31/14 UPDATE...I was just re-reading my past reviews to edit for clarity, and I&#x27;ve gotta say as I read some newer ones. We told you all of the pitfalls so that you can save your $$ &amp; time, yet people kept buying this flat iron??! Now it sounds like someone is selling knock-offs! I feel really sorry for you and of course RETURN your non-U.S.A. seller mdse. *The seller has to state in their ad if what they are selling you is an import* because warranties will not be valid and it&#x27;s then your choice if you want to make the purchase. My product was NOT from another land. Original review&gt;&gt;&gt;Hi,  I have natural 4b hair wanted to blow out and flat iron it to see how long it is. My natural hair texture has EXTREME shrinkage so it&#x27;s fun to see how long it REALLY is (ala YouTube length checks). This item is pretty pricey but I bought it based on other recommendations found here. I feel the ceramic smells so much I&#x27;m sure it leaves that smell in my hair. The iron heats up really quickly but it&#x27;s just like any other flat iron so if you know of a better brand, buy it. The iron is also not easy to handle (very slippery)if you have product in your hands which most of us use. But most importantly my hair REVERTED immediately after a light freezing cold shower (to preserve the style) 4 mins max. Thumbs down on this one.</li>
    <li> For the past 4 years I have had TWO Farouk CHI straighteners. Both died/deteriorated after the one year warranty set and both cost over $150. I read that this straightener was supposed to be the best and after paying $35 (on sale at Target) for it and then using it, I cannot believe the difference in quality from my old CHIs. The Remington knocked off 20 minutes from my straightening time and makes my hair pin straight (I have very, very curly and unruly hair). It&#x27;s so straight that I almost feel like I need to use volumizing mousse to give it a little kick. My straightened hair also usually curls in even the slightest bit of humidity. After using the Remington, my hair holds perfectly throughout the day and even after going for a run. I am very impressed by this product and highly recommend it - such a high quality product for such little money and a 4 year warranty.</li>
    <li> If I was more ambitious I would use this.  It&#x27;s a lot of work to get my hair straight and it will not cooperate. I have decided to embrace my curliness.</li>
    <li> This is an effective, easy to use straightener. Unfortunately, I was perhaps a little too hopeful on how effective it would be in taming my frizzy hair--don&#x27;t expect it to work miracles. I would say it makes some difference though.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife and the packaging is all in Spanish with a sticker noting &amp;#34;Same product different packaging&amp;#34;. Not a big deal but it kinda cheapens the gift because it looks like a knock off. I&#x27;m sure the product is legit but at first glance it really does take something away. Disappointed. Hope it works great I&#x27;ll have to wait until after Christmas to see if it&#x27;s a total bust.</li>
    <li> I love the product. I have pretty long hair and my hair looks more beautiful than ever! I am glad i found this!</li>
    <li> My daughter has used this for about a year and my wife liked it enough to buy one for herself. Just the right size, heat settings, and durability. The heating element has remained consistent.</li>
    <li> Returned it the same day that I bought it. Tried it out using 2 different hair products that have always worked well with other flat irons, but it still managed to burn my ends. Also it&#x27;s a little heavy, and couldn&#x27;t imagine using it without it tiring my arm quickly, plus it&#x27;s not comfortable to hold in my hands, didn&#x27;t care for the shape of it. I will spend more money to get a better product.</li>
    <li> I read about this particular flat iron on a list detailing the top tech products of 2010. It heats up really quickly and gets extremely hot. I have very thick hair and it did a great job of straightening it. My hair also stayed shiny and straight for days afterward. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I am African American.  I used it for my kinky hair.  It was an excellent product.  It perfectly straighten my hair for weeks on end, and I only used it for the initial straightening of my hair.  It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter, who has really frizzy/wavy hair. She&#x27;s tried several brands of flat irons, including the expensive ones. She says she really loves this one, and it&#x27;s her favorite. She says it straightens her hair considerably faster than the others, and stays straighter longer. If you could see her hair, you&#x27;d know this is no small feat. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best Flat Iron I have owned to date! I have spent twice as much on expensive brands only to have them fry my hair then fail.   I thought I would give this one a try after reading the reviews and I am glad I did! It takes no time at all to straighten my hair now, no more   going over the same sections time after time :)  Can not recommend this product enough!!! I Love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightner about 5 weeks ago.  I had read great reviews for it so I decided to go ahead and purchase it.  I&#x27;ve owned several flat irons, a few priced around $50 like this one.  My biggest problem is that I live in Ohio and in the summer it can get pretty humid and in the winter the air can be cold and sticky.  My hair is fine and has a little natural wave to it (not enough to be able to make it look good, only annoying) and when I go out in the sticky weather it no longer stays straight, even after I just straightened it.  I was a little skeptical about the Remington and had decided if I didn&#x27;t like it I was taking it back.  After I started using it a few weeks ago I can sweat, go out in humid weather, do whatever outside and my hair stays the way I styled it!  I absolutely LOVE this straightner!  It&#x27;s a bit pricier than a typical straightner you may buy but it&#x27;s totally worth it.  I would recommend it to anyone with humidity issues!</li>
    <li> I, too, had read the review in Good Housekeeping and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this out.  I have THE thickest, frizziest, curliest, rat&#x27;s nest-looking hair and have been straightening it FOREVER, having been traumatized in the 2nd grade when an entire classroom laughed at my hair in its natural state (I&#x27;m almost 50!).  Having read all of the reviews here I think I expected a miracle and maybe I was expecting too much.  The good news is that it works very, very well and I would buy it again. I believe there were issues with the previous model in that it would turn off because the buttons are right where you grasp the straightener.  On this model you can lock the temperature so that problem is solved.  Don&#x27;t get discouraged at first because you need to play around and discover which temperature works best for your hair (mine, unfortunately, is the highest).  My issues are that the corners catch my hair every now and then and that hurts.  Also, my experience is that I still have to go over the lower part of my hair more than once.  My hair definitely feels softer than with my CHI which was twice as expensive, so this is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I got this after reading about it in Good Housekeeping. I currently own a HAI flat iron that my stylist recommended.  I love my HaI but when I read about the lack of frizz the remington leaves I wanted to try it. I have to admit it worked, straightened my wavy, frizzy hair, but it KILLED it! My bangs are very badly damaged and my hair is super dry now.  I am going to my stylist to see if she can reverse any of the damage. This was done at settings as low as 320 up to 400. I tried all different settings to see if that made a difference and it did not. Be careful. If you have dry,  course hair this will probably ruin what little bit of good hair you have left!</li>
    <li> As the mother of two daughters with beautiful, strong, and VERY kinky curly hair that reverts within moments of being pressed with a straightening comb - I am AMAZED at how well the Remington Shine Therapy flat iron straightened their hair with NO ADDITIONAL PRODUCT used.    Their hair is now just as straight as it would be if I used a relaxer. No lie.    Shiny. Soft. And it lasts for a week. Even after the week, still manageable and combable.    This iron changed our lives for the better.    Seriously.    I&#x27;d give it 10 stars if I could.    P.S. I read about it in Good Housekeeping too . . . somebody tell Oprah! :)</li>
    <li> Fed up with a Chi that didn&#x27;t want to get to operating temperature, and after reading the reviews for this straightener, I went out at 9 o&#x27;clock at night to buy it. The effectiveness of this straightener was an immediate difference from my Chi turbo. I forgot what it was like to have a quality hair straightener!    Easy to use, quick to operating temperature, and works just as good as the ones used in salons. A big plus is that it has a 4 year warranty. I was a bit skeptical about buying a Remington product, but am glad I did.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is a little more expensive than the ones you may find at Target, but it is also a much better quality. I had a Conair for a long time and this Remmington iron really is much nicer and does a great job. My hair is very smooth and shiney when I use this iron. I usually just do the crown of my head and nick the ends and it really does the trick. I would definitely recommend this product to others.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now had this flat iron for over 2 years and it&#x27;s still going strong. I use it several times a week and it still works great. I would definitely buy this product again.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve now had this product for almost 5 years, and it still works great!</li>
    <li> This flat iron is simply amazing. I&#x27;ve tried and returned many flat irons searching for one that actually worked. This not only straights my hair with little effort but I also notice a big difference in how my hair looks when its humid out. I would strongly recommend this flat iron. I have naturally curly hair and this takes out alot of the frizz. The cons are that the temperature changes as you do your hair because of the location of the buttons, just lock it and it won&#x27;t be a problem. The handle also tends to get hot but not enough to seriously complain about it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener because it was the recommended top straightener. It is a good product... Not sure it is an excellent product. I was replacing a straightener that had lost its luster. I love the quick heating part, as well as the adjustable temperature and the automatic shut off. As for the straightening, I feel it does about the same job as my other straightener, which cost about half the price.</li>
    <li> For the price it was pretty awesome, cant complain!! Definitely a great buy. It arrived quickly and was really easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been a faithful Chi owner for the past 6 years.  In that time I have gone through 2 straighteners (one dropped and broke and the second finally gave out after 4 1/2 years).. I have long, thick and curly hair and I have used my friends straighteners over the years, nothing ever worked nearly as well as my Chi. When it recently stopped working (the red light would no longer turn on), I was desperate for a new straightener but being a broke college student, I didn&#x27;t have $100 to spare.  Still, I was very skeptical to purchase a &#x27;bargain&#x27; straightener. I am SO happy that I did. My mom had told me about this Remington model that she had read about in Good Housekeeping, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for a new one at the time. Luckily I remembered to look into it now and I am very glad I did. After reading numerous glowing reviews, I decided to give it a try. This straightener is AMAZING. It straightens as well, if not better than the Chi and more importantly, my hair STAYS straight throughout the day (it never did before). I don&#x27;t know what they put into the plates, but whatever it is, IT WORKS. I used much less product than I used to, (just one pump of anti frizz serum, as opposed to 2-3 pumps and a light hairspray) and my hair is softer, straighter and less frizzy than before. I haven&#x27;t really been out in high humidity to test it yet, but even if it doesn&#x27;t hold up to that, this purchase would still be worth it. It also has a 4 year warranty, which I assume is the expected life of the straightener. For only $40 THIS IS A STEAL and I absolutely recommend it and would challenge any Chi owners to say that this doesn&#x27;t perform the same or better than their current straightener for less than half the price. Try this straightener, you will not be disappointed. **Just a side note, to lock the buttons I have to hold the - button, not the + as the instructions say.  I noticed other reviewers said the same thing, I guess it&#x27;s a glitch, but it&#x27;s really not a big deal.**</li>
    <li> This Iron is really nice! I love it! it&#x27;s not expensive and it really works how it says.&lt;br /&gt;takes 30 seconds to reach the desired temperature,it doesn&#x27;t cold down while you are using it, it&#x27;s fast, safe, light weight, and easy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really curly and rebel, I always have a problem because it never looks totally straight when I&#x27;ve done it. But, I used this Iron and my hair looks amazing, totally long lasting straight, no frizz, smooth and shiny. I&#x27;m very happy with this iron.</li>
    <li> I wish they had had this straightening iron back in the day, I am sure my life would have been so different!!  Seriously, though, my hair is thick and curly, and this iron quickly makes it stick-straight and shiny as glass!  I love it!  I went without washing for four days, to see if it stayed straight, and it did, even exposed to the humidity of the bathroom after a shower.  I was concerned about the high heat, but I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair nearly as often with this iron as I did with my cheap Con Air.  Also, this iron slides smoothly through my hair without pulling or breakage.  If I have one gripe, it&#x27;s that the position of the buttons make them too easy to hit while you&#x27;re using the iron, but I can get used to that.</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron for my naturally semi-fizzy, thick and curly hair.  I have used cheap drugstore flat irons in the past and got ok results. This one works wonders! I had to learn to adjust the heat. First time I used it I had it all the way up (430) and fried the ends of my hair so I have since started at 390 and go from there depending on humidly, etc.  However, once straight it stays straight! The fizz control is definitely there! It makes my hair bone straight.  So if you&#x27;re looking for \\&quot;bounce\\&quot; or \\&quot;waves\\&quot; you need to use a different type of iron.  But for that super sleek look I love this one!  Very glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> Extensive Personal Review     (Feel free to gloss over/skip to Final Thoughts/Pros&amp;Cons if Desired)    Okay so let me start off by stating the condition of my natural hair.   I would describe my hair as having a mixture of fine and medium strands. The growth behind my ears and inner mid section of my head are fine stranded hair. These hairs seem to be the healthiest. Everywhere else seems to be of a medium texture especially the top of my head as it is prone to the most damage. It is also of medium thickness and curly/wavy. I do straighten it weekly so yes I have damage but it is not heavily extensive; just the normal split ends and some weaken strands.    Initially I was in search of some kind of anti-frizz serum that would provide me all-day humidity control. This is how I stumbled onto this iron here on Amazon. I have only owned 2 hair straightners in my lifetime. This one here now and an older Remington Wet to Straight Flat iron, which proved to straighten my hair well for years, but after a professional color treatment (something I will never do again), my hair lost much of its natural texture and would no longer hold straight. Minutes after straightening it, I&#x27;d step outside and already it&#x27;d began frizzing up and becoming poofy. I live in the South so the humidity down here can get pretty bad this time of the year.     Growing very tired of constantly restraightening my frizz-prone poofy hair and only further damaging it, I set search for products to help and Amazon brought me here.    What struck me and drew me in were all the positive reviews of this product (great frizz-control in humidity and comparisons to the CHI.) I have never owned a CHI, but I figured if it was getting such great reviews and getting comparing it to a \\&quot;high-end iron\\&quot;, it&#x27;d had to be good, right? And so, I decided to purchase it. (Didn&#x27;t need that anti-frizz serum after all.)    I purchased the iron at a local Walmart, and now regret not purchasing it on here, as it would of saved me some money but all is still good. I&#x27;d advise doing some comparative shopping before purchasing to ensure the best price.    MY FIRST EXPERIENCE    The first time I tried the iron, my hair was already previously straightened using my Remington Wet to Straight Iron, and let me say, my first experience with this iron I did not like so much. I did not find that it straighten my hair as beautifully and flawlessly as some reviews claimed it did. I also really did not like the fact that I could not increase//decrease the temperature in increments of one instead of 10. My first time, I found the temperature of 360 to be too hot, it was frying my ends, and decreasing it brought it down to 340 (a temperaure that at the time I found not hot enough). So there I was with big hopes and expectations and alittle let down. I had plans of returning the very next day, but what stopped me in my tracks was the evident fact that I did find my hair to be less frizzy/poofy outside afterwards. I reasoned the iron had something to do with it, so I decided to give it another go.     SECOND TIME    Second time using this thing, I decided to wash my hair and allow it to air dry before straightening ( I never blow dry). This time, I saw the difference the reviews were talking about. It did straighten nice and my strands glided through smoothly and effortlessly. There was also a nice sheen and softness to my hair that I had yet to have felt in a long time. My hair actually did feel healthier. I found my perfect temperature too: 340 (very minimal damage to   the ends.) This iron does do a very good job of straightening, a much better job than my old Wet to Straight iron. My ends come out straight and soft, almost like when you get a fresh haircut. The old damage is still there and of course still visible, but this thing really camoflauges it while making your hair look and feel so much more softier and healthier.    FINAL THOUGHTS    I&#x27;ve been owning this iron for about 2 weeks now and I have many reasons to keep it, as well as two reasons to return it, but I find it makes my hair look and feel too beautiful for me to return it!     The number one reason why I&#x27;d consider returning this iron is the fact that it really gets my hair oily as I am straightening it (has to be the micro conditioning oils.) I do not have naturally oily hair. I straighten my hair at night and fall asleep on it, and this I find is saving me. The fabrics of my bed/pillow must be absorbing a lot of the oils as I sleep, so when I awake I have soft pretty/beautiful hair. :) With the oil though, comes another problem. Now I need to wash my hair more often in between straightenings, which I dislike but do not fear. The oil it produces in the hair, is not a yucky oil, but a soft, smoothing oil. Just find it to be excessive during the straightening process though (feels as if I sprayed my hair with a sheen spray.) If you find that it is also making your hair oily, i&#x27;d advice not using any other products in your hair. I find that I don&#x27;t even need a heat protectant anymore as the oils alone do a very good job of protecting my hair from damage. I did not notice the oily problem the first time (just looked &amp; felt shiny and soft), but up until about 3 uses with the iron, I started to feel it pretty bad (must be a cumulative effect.)     Even though the oily-ness can be a bit of a issue for some and myself as well, I still didn&#x27;t feel the need the knock off 2 stars. The iron nevertheless, is an awesome contender against frizz and humidity. This same oil (oily-ness) is after all what&#x27;s fighting the frizz.  Just be sure to use as little product as possible and wash your hair very well in between straightenings and you&#x27;ll be left with soft, shiny beautiful hair :) I am however thinking if the oil accumulates very heavily in my hair, I may start washing my hair with a weekly clarifying shampoo. I just started washing with Brilliant Brunette the same time that I got the iron, and I speculate that the shampoo may be what&#x27;s making my hair soft and oily during straightenings, or it may be cumulatively building up in my hair, along with the micro oils adding much too oil in my hair. If anything, i&#x27;d return the iron because of this oilyness issue that may or may not develop into a problem. I hope it does not, if I does, let&#x27;s hope I grap my clarifying shampoo first :)    The problem some have of accidently pressing the controls while straightening, I never had nor have.     Also, the statements that this iron gets hair pin straight, I myself did not necessarily witness. I am sure the iron can get hair pin straight, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to try it as I am assuming much heat is required and I myself do not want to subject my hair to such kind of damage. It more than likely varies from hair to hair and person to person etc, but like I said this is a really good straightener, really does straighten very well and I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about its straightening abilities.     Will this iron keep your hair straight all day?   I am more than sure it will. It really holds well up to humidity, but I am a heavy sweater, and so find that when I waken the hair under my neck and behing my ears waves, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me most the time. I actually prefer the look it creates, soft flowly strands :) Again, I&#x27;m sure this will vary from person to person and hair to hair.     PROS    1. Light Weight &amp; Compact   2. Real Ceramic Plates ( Your Hair Does Actually Feel &amp; Look Better than Before Usage)  3. Pretty Clean Color (I Like the White &amp; Love the Blue Digital Display :) )  4. Does a Really Good Job of Straightening (Yields Professionals Results)  5. Makes Hair Softier, Shiner, &amp; Bouncier &#x3D; Sexy Hair Time ;)   6. Actually Does What it Promises (Eliminates/Reduces Frizz Significantly All-Day :) )    This is and was the number one reason why I bought the iron and your reason too I assume, for looking into it. I get over 3 days of frizz free/slightest frizz with this iron.CONS    1. Makes My Hair Oily    Can be come a problem for some. I&#x27;d advice not touching your hair then your face, as it may cause breakouts. Hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet, but I&#x27;m considering all things.     2. 1- inch Plate is Too Small (Wish it was atleast 2- inches)    I was hoping I&#x27;d speed up the time required to straight my hair (past my shoulders), but I still take over an hour to complete my entire head of hair. Don&#x27;t know how others are straightening their hair in half an hour to minutes!     Despite the oil issue, I would recommend this iron as a great means of control/elimination of frizz and promotion of soft/silky/shiny healthier hair. Also Great Straightner!    Sorry for the length (I Like to Write) :)</li>
    <li> This is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever had! Leaves hair silky, and the style lasts longer. Very happy with my purchase; I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This will be the second flat iron I have purchased in a year.My daughter liked mine so much I gave it to her.So I need a new one.Tried a few others but none compare.  It really does control frizz and big hair.  I like the beep when temp is reached.  BUT we both agree the controls need to be inside as are most other flat irons.  She is right handed I am left.It does not matter,we both change the settings when doing our hair.  So if you do not mind that one draw back it is worth it.  Also found that though it is available online the price has gone up!</li>
    <li> She love it and told me that works like a professional one.  I am really happy because the price that I paid.</li>
    <li> This is the first and only flat iron that I have owned and I love it!  If you hold down the + button, it locks the temp..wonderful.  It&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener that I&#x27;ve ever bought! Also, the automatic shut off feature is a life saver!</li>
    <li> This is a great straightner. Maybe not the *best* I&#x27;ve ever used, but it works well on my hair, and I&#x27;m sure it would be fantastic if I devoted more time to properly straightening my hair (rather than doing it quickly before I run to work). The other reviews are right on -- if you&#x27;re looking for a good product, this is for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for a long time now. I love it. My hair stays straight forever and it heats fairly quickly. My only complaints are that the tip doesn&#x27;t stay cool and the plastic on the sides is melting because I curl my hair with it. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
    <li> My first hair straightener was a brick compared to this slim, easily manipulated styler.  It heats quickly and is very easily applied for straightening, for lift at the roots, or to flip the ends.  I like that I can control the temp and that I can save the best one for my hair.  The device handles well and fits comfortably into my hand.  It seals tightly against my hair and I don&#x27;t have to apply pressure to maintain the grip or to slide the iron the length of my hair.  My hair is short to medium length and wavy, and I can go through it with the iron in about 8 minutes.  That it shuts off automatically after an hour left on is much appreciated.  Frizz control is flawless, as expected, though I was surprised by how shiny it leaves my hair.  In winter my hair tends to become quite dry and dull, though with this iron it shimmers and stays soft.  I can sleep on it, wake up, and go.  It still looks styled and fabulous.  This iron is mid-range, as prices for them go, and is well-worth every dime.  Durability will be a deciding factor in my choice to stick with this brand and model.  For the time being, it&#x27;s a perfect straightening tool.</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I have ever used!  I have had a few in the past, and the quality of this straightener blows away that of straighteners that were more expensive.  Totally worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair - wavier on top and tighter curls underneath and this thing can take me from curly to straight without blowdrying.   Nothing bad to say about this flat iron. I&#x27;d highly reccomend it!</li>
    <li> I needed to get a new flat iron to travel to Europe because my old one didn&#x27;t have dual voltage.  I decided to get this one based on the reviews and the price.  I was pretty skeptical about the claims for &#x27;frizz control&#x27; and &#x27;humidity resistant&#x27; but thought it was worth a try.  Wow, am I glad I tried it.  This Remington S9951 Shine Therapy Frizz Control flat iron actually lives up to it&#x27;s advertising.  I style my hair not totally straight, but with a slight curve and this iron does the job in short order.  It literally cut my styling time in half compared to my previous iron.  One quick pass with this iron was sufficient, whereas my old iron required two slow passes for the best straightening (I have fine, relatively straight hair and lots of it) and this means less damage from styling - a very welcome bonus!  I was a bit nervous about the &#x27;floating&#x27; plates, because on previous irons they tended to trap individual hairs and pull.  No such problem with this iron.  My &#x27;frizzless&#x27; style even survived a hot shower.  Amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love my flat iron, left my hair so smoothly and shine. I use that with chi keratin treatment and chi iron guard, and my hair looks amazing!</li>
    <li> I have used every straightener out there, from the $350 ones to the $20  and if it&#x27;s humid out, my hair starts to curl immediately. This straighter is AMAZING and the price is FABULOUS!! My hair remained straight through a very hot day, I was sweating, and it was straight straight. I will never use a different straighter again. Seriously, I was not expecting much from a $50 straightener, but I am eating my words. BEST STRAIGHTENER out there!</li>
    <li> I am trying to simplify my life and part of that was reducing the number of bathroom appliances. I bought this initially as it looked solid and had a digital readout. I was unsure if I would keep it cause I am not one to splurge on things. However after using it - it tossed the box away and donated all my other hair appliances - except for the dryer. If you have curly hair that hates the summer humidity this is the GEM for you. Do it - treat yourself - and you&#x27;ll get to get rid of all those so-so working appliances. Woot - Woot!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many straighteners over the years and was very skeptical about trying a new one....but I saw the price and just couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I got it very quickly and couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and use it. It heat up very quickly and I only had to go over it a few times and it was straight out of the salon straight... I WAS AMAZED....and it took me 10 minutes when it usually takes me hours...my hair is so course and curly it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get perfectly straight and this one did it!! :D</li>
    <li> This straightener puts all my old ones to shame! I have naturally wavey hair, and normally I would have to repeatedly go over the same strands of hair multiple times to see high-quality results, but this one only takes a few seconds to get it how I want it! The heat up time is really speedy, and the straighteners highest heat is impressive.   My hair stays straight until the next time it&#x27;s wet with this straightener, with only a few touch-ups needing to be done. I have recommended it to a few friends do the same for you if you like seeing results!</li>
    <li> I used to have an expensive, $100 flat iron, but I lost it when I moved this summer. I was so angry that I put off buying another one for quite awhile. Finally when it started to get cooler outside and I couldn&#x27;t justify wearing my hair in a ponytail every single day, I decided to start looking for a new flat iron. I was looking at the CHI brand when I stumbled across this product. My hair isn&#x27;t super frizzy, but I currently have it permed so it&#x27;s very kinky and wavy.  When I used the iron for the first time, I was incredibly surprised at how quickly it straightened my hair with just one pass! Not even my $100 iron could do that! And the straight hair lasted through the next couple days, although my roots were a little bit greasy. If you are blessed with magic hair that doesn&#x27;t become oily in a day, you could have pin straight hair for days!  Love the floating plates and the automatic turn off and... Okay, I love everything about this iron!  The lock and unlock buttons aren&#x27;t what is written in the instruction booklet, but I still gave the product 5 stars because it didn&#x27;t inconvenience me for more than about 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> I replaced a much more expensive flatiron with this one and this one actually works better BUT it turns itself off while heating up.  I have to keep turning it back on and adjusting the temp control over and over before it will finally stay on.  I saw another review of this item that said the same thing.  It is annoying because I generally like to let my flat iron heat up while I am doing other things and to have to sit there and watch it wastes a lot of time.  BUT once it stays on, it works great and it straightens my very thick, coarse hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t want to sound like a Debbie Downer but I found this iron to be just ok. Let me explain, first of all let me start by saying I&#x27;m a product snob. I have for most of the time I&#x27;ve been straightening my hair (5 years) I have used expensive straighteners. For the past three years, I&#x27;ve been using a Paul Mitchell iron. I have also owned a Chi and a Solia. The one I&#x27;m currently using is the Paul Mitchel Ion express (silver color). Absolutely love it, thats for another review. Anyway, I&#x27;m Italian with thick, course, curly/wavy hair. My experience with the Remington Frizz Therapy iron is this, I will say it straightened my hair better than expected. I was actually shocked how well it straightened, as well as my current iron , Paul Mitchell. As well as all the other high ticket irons I have purchased in the past. The issue that I had with this iron was that this iron fried the ends of my hair. Again it did a wonderful job straightening but for some reason my ends just got totally fried. I experimented with the different heat settings but that did not help. This iron also left my hair dry and kind of lifeless. It&#x27;s too bad because I really wanted to like this iron. Coming from a Paul Mitchell iron, I guess I am just spoiled now. If you are currently using a cheapie iron like a Revlon etc, you will really love and appreciate this iron. For the price it&#x27;s a steal, I&#x27;m sorry it did not work out better for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife for christmas,because she hated her old one. She was very happy with it and used it as soon she saw it. I can definately see a difference in her hair and she still loves it!</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast (~1 minute), very quick at making hair straight and hair stays straight all day.  Great product, been using since Christmas day.</li>
    <li> These get hot really fast and works great on my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Does what it says.  Heats well, straightens my curly locks too.  Recommend.</li>
    <li> I was excited about trying this product out as it received rave reviews by the Good Housekeeping magazine. I also read several reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me approximately 20 minutes to saw it out of the heavy duty plastic packaging. Much/most of the wording on the outside of the package is in Spanish. I did see the S-9951 number on the package, this was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is frizzy/curly and very fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron heats up quickly but with a terrible odor. I tried to let it heat up for a bit in advance to see if the odor would burn off, it did not and the odor transferred to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no model number on the device itself and it does not say Frizz Therapy as it does in the Amazon picture. The flat iron looks rather plain and flimsy for $60. I ordered via Amazon as I was not able to find this in any of the stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buttons/heat adjustment are on the outside, on the handle. They are not on the side as I see in the Amazon picture. I accidentally press the buttons when I am using the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worse part of the flat iron is that my hair goes from frizzy to fly away, like static electricity and dull. I am wondering if it is not&lt;br /&gt;particularly designed for fine hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, is this product a knock off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone have any other ideas or experience to share with me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try taking this on my next visit to the hair salon to ask the beautician what&lt;br /&gt;she thinks. She has used a flat iron on my hair with very wonderful results.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever had!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about 1 year.  I use it at least once per week.  In my experience, it is just an OK straightener.  You can&#x27;t flip it around and do curls with it like you can with other brands - it will leave weird looking crimps because the edges aren&#x27;t rounded enough.  Also, I find that it doesn&#x27;t work well with my hair type.  I have a LOT of thick, dark blonde hair.  As soon as I use this straightener on a small section, it becomes statically charged and sticks up on the sides!  I use a heat protector, which should help avoid this, but it doesn&#x27;t.  It may reduce frizz, but you are really trading frizz for static!  IMO, you should invest in a higher quality straightener.</li>
    <li> Hi.  I purchased this straightener after reading the reviews.  I have used it for the past 2 months and I am not satisfied with it. I have shoulder-length hair that is frizzy and wavy.  It does not straighten my hair well and I have to go back over it at least three times with All Soft Heat Glide.  I expected this straighter to work better than it did, especially with the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing the HSI Straightener that had much better reviews, which is the same price or more affordable than this straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair that is difficult to straighten or is frizzy and wavy, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a total believer! This flat iron is incredible! Going on 6 hours and the humidity has done NOTHING to my straightened locks! My hair is smooth, shiny, and with no hint of curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really fast, is easy to maneuver, and works really well. I&#x27;d buy this over and over again</li>
    <li> This flat iron is amazing. Before I had this flat iron I had to have a Brazilian Keratin treatment in order to manage my frizzy hair in the summer. This past summer I purchased the Remington S-9951 Frizz Therapy, Humidity resistant flat iron and my hair was straight and smooth, all summer long. I would wash it, blow dry and then flat iton my hair and it would stay straight and frizz free until the next time I washed my hair, usually two or three days later. It is also easy to handle and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it. Just wish it was dual voltage so that I could take it with me when I travel...</li>
    <li> This straightened my hair like NO OTHER!! And it stayed straight for the longest time too!!   I still haven&#x27;t been able to get the hang of \\&quot;locking\\&quot; it when I want to set it for a certain degree. Hm.</li>
    <li> I love that i don&#x27;t have to wait more than half a minute for this to heat up. It works great and wasn&#x27;t too much.</li>
    <li> Good Product. Does&#x27;t burn the hair and does straighten it. The only drawback is   the length of the handle is too short. There is a tendency to burn you fingers if  you are not careful.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does beautiful work on my hair, leaving it shiny and straight all day.. The only downfall I had with it is it gets WAY too hot especially with not being able to turn it down past 300 degrees F. It seems a little extreme but it does work well!&lt;br /&gt;The buttons may seem to get in the way but the button lock is easy to figure out! A little spendy for a flat iron but overall pretty satisfied.</li>
    <li> I had a cheap straightening iron and it was pretty poor and achieving the look I desired and it left my hair very dry, even though I condition it everyday. I decided I need to move up to a Ceramic Iron, but was worried about how much cash I was going to have to cough up. When I found this product I was very surprised and the very reasonable price and decided to give it a try. I am very. very glad I did! I&#x27;ve seen Ceramic Irons priced at $100 and up and there was no way I was going to dish out that much money. I am glad I didn&#x27;t! This iron is an absolute jewel! It is amazing how quickly it warms up, how quickly it adjust heat if want to change it, moves through your hair without you even feeling it (zero tugging or pulling of hair) and one or two passes and you have straight hair! And straight hair that is not dry, because of the moisturizers built right into the Ceramic plates (not sure how long the moisturizers will last yet). For the price, you cannot beat this iron! If you own one of those $100 and up irons...when it finally gives up the ghost...just buy this one and you will be amazed at the results and tickled to death with how much money you just saved!</li>
    <li> I bought this item off Amazon about a year ago after reading the scores of reviews and hearing about it&#x27;s mention in Good Housekeeping Magazine. As others have said, this product performs just as reported. It&#x27;s by far the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used, and much less bulky than the Hot Tools Professional one I owned before this. I especially like the cord feature at the bottom that prevents it from getting tangled in it&#x27;s own cord. Additionally, the flat iron really gets hot, I often has to turn it down from the pre-set temperature setting to avoid burning my hair.   All in all, well worth they money. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I ordered a replacement of my S-9951 flat iron because I let my granddaughter have mine.  I had already shopped for a replacement iron for me but could only find a newer version. I wanted  one just like I had which is the one pictured here so I ordered it .  The one I received was the new version which I could have bought at many places at a substantially lower price.  I am very disappointed and am not sure what I will do at this point.  Will say the shipping was VERY fast.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron. Order the wider one in black and pink and I hate that one hard to use.</li>
    <li> Had it for 2 years.....reliable and dependable . It gets my hair very straight. My hair is natural and it doesn&#x27;t heat damage my hair (I use it along with a heat protector serum)</li>
    <li> This product was well worth the investment, purchased a cheaper on but was not nearly as effective as this item.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up fast and never snags my hair. It works beautifully. I like that it has an automatic shutoff, because I&#x27;m a little forgetful sometimes.</li>
    <li> I have thick, frizzy and curly/wavy hair. Straightening my hair has always been a chore, but not anymore! Now I can straighten all of my hair within half an hour. I don&#x27;t blowdry it first either! I brush my hair, take a fine tooth comb and straighten section by section. This does keep the humidity out of your hair, my hair stays flat for days until I wash it. Also, it makes nice flips at the bottom of my hair!</li>
    <li> An EXCELLENT straightener! One of the best I&#x27;ve everrr had. My daughter &amp; I have nice, thick hair &amp; live in humid Houston, TX. Soooo, it takes a real machine to calm our manes! Lol!</li>
    <li> the straightener works great in my opinion but after just a few days i would put it on and it would turn off by itself after a minute or so. Overall i was satisfied with the product and how it worked, but it seems to break fast or something.</li>
    <li> The site advertised this item to be dual voltage and as such, you wouldn&#x27;t require a transformer to use it abroad. However, after checking the manual that came with the product and then confirming the voltage inside the straightener, it was disappointing to find it to work only under 120V ~ 60Hz.  We called Remington and one person said that there were two versions of the product, another said that Remington does not make worldwide voltage products anymore. Luckily, both of us said that we could complete a refund, so we are going to return it.  If you are buying this product based on it&#x27;s dual voltage, I suggest you go in store and buy it so that you can check whether or not it is REALLY worldwide voltage.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 10 year old Revlon straightner. It does get hair straight and gets VERY hot. I had to adjust my temp way down so I didn&#x27;t fry all my hair. The first time using did have a weird smell but quickly went away. There is 2 reasons I gave this product 4 stars, 1. strands of hair sometimes get stuck in the floating plate cracks and pulls my hair (something I can live with). 2. Seems to make the small strands on the very top of my head stand straight up (so I have to hairspray them down). Other than that it is great. Makes my hair shiny and is quick to use. I have had NO issues with the button placement on this. I struggle to imagine how people are turning up/down the heat or completely off without knowing so.</li>
    <li> First of all, be careful when using this or any other flat iron.  I&#x27;ve used a \\&quot;flocked\\&quot; curling iron for several years which is coated with a felt-like material which doesn&#x27;t get all that hot, so I&#x27;ve forgotten how hot and dangerous these things can get.  I burned my finger pretty bad using this.  That being said, the controls on this are in a very awkward position and unless you lock the temperature it&#x27;s easy to press the temperature set buttons while you&#x27;re styling. (I was trying to avoid these buttons when I got burned).  You need to experiment to see which temperature works best for your hair type.  You will get totally different results based on the temperature.  The instructions provide a general guide but you should start low and work your way up and use a heat protection product on your hair because these things can really cause damage.  My hairdresser has recommended that I not use this every day.  Despite the burn and the awkward controls I will probably keep this product and get myself a pair of thermal gloves to prevent future burns. The plates are very smooth and sleek, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, and I got pretty good results getting some awkward waves out of my fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> It was okay at first.  The control buttons are in an unfortunate position, it is true, it is easy to accidentally adjust the temperature on this straightener.  It does indeed get insanely hot, much hotter than any straightener I&#x27;ve used before. I can understand how it fried a few reviewer&#x27;s lovely locks.  I used it about five times, then one morning it simply wouldn&#x27;t heat up.  The light came on, it reacted as though it would heat up, but within less than a minute, it turned off.  No heat.  Still waiting for approval on the return.  I received it as a Christmas present from my husband.  I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will accept the return, but I sure hope so.  It really was a huge disappointment and it turned out to be a piece of junk.</li>
    <li> Top-notch product.  This is the second one we have purchased because we were so pleased with the first one, and because we have two teen daughters.</li>
    <li> Not purple as shown in the picture and all the writing and instructions are in Spanish?????????  We speak and read English!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews before purchasing this product! i went ahead and purchased it. I am super happy with it. It makes my hair nice and sleek and as far as for the frizz it takes care of it! I would really recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I bhought this straightener because so I could use it in the US as well as abroad. It&#x27;s description refers to its Worldwide Voltage. Even 2 out of 3 Walmart supplies indicated the same. [...]  But when the product arrived, it said it was only 120V. No mention of dual voltage, worldwide voltage anywhere. In fact, there is no switch, or any thing indicating dual voltage anywhere.    Since some reviews said a plug adapter was all that is necessary, I plugged it in using the same. There was a hissing sound a soon as I did, and smoke started coming out from under the floating plates. In about 10 seconds the outside of the lower middle prong was too hot to even touch!    I had very high expectations from the brand and the product. But am very very dissappointed. Remington needs to verify whether or not this product has the voltage range to be used abroad without a transformer. Otherwise, it&#x27;s not only False Advertising, but also potentially dangerous to life and limb.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter and  she loves it. Very pleased with. A Super price for a great product.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair smooth and shiny.  Best iron I have ever had.  Better than the Chi that I used to have!!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> My favorite hair straighter of all time. Love how it removes frizz from your hair. I have extremely thick frizzy and curly hair. This product leaves my hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and received a completely different straightener...</li>
    <li> My problem it&#x27;s only 120v but my country is 220 volt , but it&#x27;s really great product</li>
    <li> I have always straightened my hair with a round brush and a blow dryer- this is my first straightener. I decided to test it out on a 105 degree day with a lot of humidity. It really does work. This product is amazing. I was able to use the straightener faster than a blow dryer/round brush and my hair stayed straight. I didn&#x27;t have any frizz. What is even more amazing is the next day I didn&#x27;t have to do any touch ups except around my face where it had gotten wet.</li>
    <li> I have been very frustrated as of late. My hair has changed as it has become more and more gray.  Where once it had been smooth, straight, and shiny, it is now wiry and frizzy with a wavy texture.  In addition, I had recently added highlights to my Level 5 hair color to make the overall look lighter as I want to go to a lighter overall color (the now 80% grey hair shows pretty obvious roots on medium reddish brown after just 2 weeks ... I am slowly migrating to a light golden brown).  This highlighting really stressed my hair and made it feel rough and dried out.  No amount of conditioner cured it.  Straightening the very frizzy fuzz all over was impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this Flat Iron: washed hair this AM.  Added admittedly a new product that may also share some of the praise (GVP Smooth Serum) and my hair is soft, bouncy, straight, shiny.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t believe the difference.  I thought I had ruined my hair ... but here it is back to its former glory ... well almost LOL</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, I have very thick wavy and frizzy hair which took me a good 20 minutes to straighten with my older Remington. It now takes me half the time and it actually is completely straight rather than mostly straight. It is much smoother and my somewhat split ends are not frizzy anymore. It takes one swipe over a section of hair to make it straight and it doesn&#x27;t snag or pull my hair. Very happy with it!!</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that i&#x27;m am African American woman and i&#x27;ve tried a couple of straighteners and this by far is the best.I would recommend this for all hair types.It makes my hair sleek and shining and so straight and i&#x27;m outside at least 3hrs a day and no frizz to speak of.I would also recommend using hair gloss as well.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for about a year.  I use it everyday.  I keep it on a lower heat setting, 320, so that it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.  Because of this I do have to run the straightener over my hair several times but it comes out straight. The humidity does affect my hair but I live in New Jersey which tends to be very humid.  I am satisfied with how well it straightens my hair as it is always smooth when I&#x27;m finished.  My biggest complaint would be that the plastic part of the straightener isn&#x27;t holding up well.  The grey color has rubbed off completely in the areas that my hand touches every day.  It&#x27;s not a huge deal but is starting to feel kinda dirty.  So overall it does a great job straightening my hair but the plastic parts aren&#x27;t meant to last.</li>
    <li> I had such high hopes for this flat iron.  I used it maybe 10 times and 9 of those were a struggle to get it to stay on. It was not worth the headache to get it to stay on and hot enough to use. I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST FLAT I EVER HAD, ITS AMAZING YOU NEVER GET FRIZZ ON YOUR HAIR, IN A FEW MINUTES YOU HAIR WILL LOOK AWESOME.. SUPER HAPPY WITH IT</li>
    <li> Buen producto desde Venezuela me gusto sabor Todas Llegaron EN BUEN ESTADO Y Valen La Pena Se Las recomiendo Con Los Ojos Cerrados</li>
    <li> Sometimes I straighten my hair and I figured anything that will help with frizz would be better.  Not sure how it really works, but it certainly does; sometimes too well.  If you have oily hair, be careful you don&#x27;t overuse it because it will make your hair look greasy.  I just concentrate more on the ends and it works pretty good though.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!!! Unlike other flat Irons my hair isn’t left spelling burnt or singed, and I don’t have to straighten 15 strands of hair at a time to get a great frizz free hairstyle...Love it....</li>
    <li> I am usually too lazy to leave a review unless I really meet a product Mr right. What could you expect for a 50 dollars hair straightener? I would tell you that this one even beat the hundreds dollar product!I use it every morning and it not only leave me a smooth, shine hair but also a good mood. It will never cause never damage your hair like other straightener but just make your hair look gorgeous!Also, it&#x27;s quick to heat up so you don&#x27;t have to worry about rush. So try it! You will never get disappointed!</li>
    <li> It will dry out your hair, seriously, don&#x27;t buy this one. I purchased this hair straightener to replace one I previously owned, which was burned down as I plugged it into one of the power outlets of an old house. My hair had never been dried out when I was using the old one, but after using this one, my hair was totally damaged. I&#x27;m thinking about getting a new straightener right now. Ladies, for the sake of your hair, plz do not use this hair straightener. You may buy it, but plz do not use it, period.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS HAIR STRAIGHTENER BECAUSE EVERYBODY RATED IT AT A 4 OR 5 STARS AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AMAZING!! THE STRAIGHTENER I HAD BEFORE THIS ONE HAD CERAMIC PLATES BUT IT FELT THICKER THAN THIS ONE.  THIS ONE IS SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH FRIZZ AND I GUESS IN A WAY IT DOES BUT I DON&#x27;T THINK IT DOES AN AMAZING JOB AT STRAIGHTENING MY HAIR HOW I LIKE IT.  I WILL MOST LIKELY BE GETTING ANOTHER ONE.  WHEN I RECEIVED THE BOX IN THE MAIL EVERYTHING IN THE BOX WAS IN SPANISH.  I&#x27;M NOT SURE IF THIS CAME FROM MEXICO OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT BUT I COULDN&#x27;T READ ANYTHING ON IT.</li>
    <li> i love this flat iron - easy to use  - and my hair looks like I just had it done!!</li>
    <li> I have very troublesome hair, and this flat iron is way better than straighteners that cost twice as much (ahem, Chi)! It has as nice digital display and a wide variety of heat settings. It hasn&#x27;t broken yet, which I can&#x27;t say for the others (Chi, again). Not much else to say other than that it does its job!</li>
    <li> So i never write reviews but i had to give credit to this flat iron. I am African American and i have naturally curly hair(the springy curls) so its hard to get my hair bone straight. So i decide to browse for a great flat iron. I ran across this one and read so many good reviews i decided to purchase it. I am so ever happy that i did. I flat ironed my hair last night, woke up this morning and went outside. My hair is still straight!! My boyfriend even noticed and asked if i flat ironed it again. I told him no with a huge grin on my face. I would definitely recommend this. It performs miracles.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron because my last one wouldn&#x27;t close all the way. My last one was made by Remington so I thought I&#x27;d get the same one. But unfortunately The don&#x27;t sell the one I used to to. I read some of the reviews on this one and thought this one would be perfect for my course hair. I should have went straight to the bad reviews. Someone with course hair burned their hair with this product as did I. I straightened it for  a shoot and went to wash it after my job and it did not go back to it&#x27;s natural texture. It stayed straight. Two months later, it started breaking off. It has been breaking off for a few months now and is now an inch long. I&#x27;m completely devastated. I&#x27;ve never had problems with my hair until I used this product.</li>
    <li> This thing started off pretty nice and it was the best thing in the world but after just three months it started to turn off automatically and then started to burn off my ends! DO NOT BUT IT! If you are looking for something temporarily i would but it until you find something better. I never write reviews but I had to let the African American community know.</li>
    <li> Everybody is amazed with my straightener n how cheap I got it . It helps the natural frizzy hairs straighten out , great for curly hair</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener.It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause much damage to my hair. (well more damage.) overall a great product for a good price.</li>
    <li> such a great product.. my sisters and mom use it all the time and even bought another one!</li>
    <li> My Daughter and I use this all the time, her more so than me, and it works great! I have had it for a long time now and have no complaints. Every once in a while I have to clean the plates but other than that, retains the heat well and its always worked. Sometimes I have to turn it down though because its gets very hot. Overall, good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the money! I paid $23 on E**y w/ free shipping. I will not ever seek out an over priced flat iron again. Make certain that you use a smoothing serum after you blow dry hair. Yes, all my packaging we in Spanish as well. The only con is that my finger hits the temp button. Also you must do a conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 190c-200c is perfect for my hair. This applience gets very hot so be careful.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron ever! I have had this flat iron for 3 years now and it still works perfect and keeps my hair straight all day long sometimes 2 days! Ive used more expensice brands and they dont keep your hair straight or they pull the hair. I have absolutely loved this flat iron the last 3 years and im just now replacing it because I yanked the cord out of it by accident so I am going to get the exact same one and enjoy it another 3 years maybe more!</li>
    <li> I have long, thick, course, wavy hair and this flat iron works great. Heats up super fast and I love the extra boost of heat and lock on the buttons. Definitely de-frizzes well, and smoothness lasts longer than any other flat iron I have used.</li>
    <li> Bought this for me, didn&#x27;t work very well. Should have listened to the other review. Do NOT buy this item!</li>
    <li> This iron is amazing. I have had a couple of Chi irons and have broken 2 of them. I was looking for a lower cost alternative and this is IT. The is excellent. I love it so much I bought two.</li>
    <li> This is the best flat iron around!! Hair stays stick straight, even in humidity. Totally recommended. Has Good Housekeeping seal of approval and def deserves it!!</li>
