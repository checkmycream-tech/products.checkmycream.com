      <li>Happy with my purchase!</li>
      <li>I especially love the cleansing milk and toner.</li>
      <li>Very impressed!</li>
      <li>Great for traveling!</li>
      <li>The wonderful pomegrante mask is very good.</li>
      <li>All of the products were very good</li>
      <li>I stated in the title, it is a great concept but over all it just did not deliver as promised.</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying this was a great sample kit.</li>
      <li>Great starter kit.</li>
      <li>and it was a great find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>enzyme exfoliating mask smells great.</li>
      <li>Very nice set.</li>
      <li>this product line is amazing!  </li>
      <li>andalou products all smell good, though.  </li>
      <li>For the first time since I hit puberty I can go without makeup and look great!!</li>
      <li>skin has never felt better!  </li>
      <li>moisturizer and face mask made my skin feel amazing after using them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a nice thing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The perfecting and night creams smell really good and fruity like most Andalou Naturals products.</li>
      <li>so I have to apply another kind.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cleanser - smells great, very mild, my favorite product in the kit.  </li>
      <li>This was an ok deal but the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>It may work well for people with oily skin, or living in a more humid climate (I am in Colorado); however, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>My face has never been softer or more moisturized.</li>
      <li>I am 40 and my skin looks better now than it ever has.  </li>
      <li>I am IN LOVE with these products.  </li>
      <li>It says on the instructions to use it 2-3x a week, but I think it may be sufficient for most to use it once a week only.&lt;br /&gt;The two creams are in the kit a day and night cream.  </li>
      <li>never been able to go without makeup to cover it up.  </li>
      <li>One feels pampered knowing the ingredients are top of the line and thei company&#x27;s philosophy</li>
      <li>I love the idea of non chemical, non gmo cleansers.</li>
      <li>I bought the &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; to see if I like it and did not find the product to be any better than Olay Regenerist.</li>
      <li>Smells great and works really well.</li>
      <li>Love these products.</li>
      <li>Love each product in this set.</li>
      <li>I loved all of the items in this set, they worked very well on my skin type.  </li>
      <li>So gentle, and just feels so good on your skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and a super way to try the whole line.</li>
      <li>They both are very mild and I like using them.  </li>
      <li>My Mom was looking for a good skin-care product, and I love Andalou Naturals, so I thought I would purchase this for her for an early Mother&#x27;s Day gift, so she could try out their products.  </li>
      <li>It is also good to try them out first before you commit to full sizes.  </li>
      <li>Still a good product, and recommend to anyone on the go that wants to keep their skin clean.</li>
      <li>I ordered this kit just to try it out since my sister had given me a sample of the perfecting cream, it is wonderful and the one little hereditary wrinkle I have has all but become less noticeable, the face wash was awesome</li>
      <li>and my skin is completely free of acne and feels a lot smoother before I used the product.  </li>
      <li>The toner does remove make-up, but that&#x27;s not its primary job.  </li>
      <li>Which is kind of a bummer because that&#x27;s what I was really looking forward to trying.</li>
      <li>This set worked well on a recent trip; great products in convenient travel size.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much I decided to buy the Get Started</li>
      <li>Overall, a great buy.  </li>
      <li>Feels good to use natural ingredients on my skin</li>
      <li>but so far so good</li>
      <li>I follow it up with a rich moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I like an almost squeaky clean finish after using a face wash.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t clean my pores.</li>
      <li>I really love this whole line.</li>
      <li>Andalou Naturals actually feels good on my skin.  </li>
      <li>I appreciate the sample set to try the products before purchasing a full sized set.  </li>
      <li>I have lost so much money trying out natural face products and so far I have not been impressed until I used this kit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Once you try this sample you will purchase the full size....</li>
      <li>I love the whole set and am saving up to buy the full size versions.  </li>
      <li>First night using, my face is clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I think I get more out of my Lush and Michael Todd</li>
      <li>This would be great for someone with very sensitive, extremely dry skin with no</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this entire line.  </li>
      <li>All the products in this kit smell very heavenly, a mild fruity scent and not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>probiotic cleansing milk didn&#x27;t do very much for me.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try the product before purchasing &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34;, It does what it says, and was very affordable!</li>
      <li>I just do not like the reaction I got at first</li>
      <li>How many people when traveling use facial masks!</li>
      <li>I think it works pretty well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>I read about this company in FIRST for Women magazine</li>
      <li>love how it makes my skin feel, only 1 week into</li>
      <li>So far no bad reaction.</li>
      <li>Will continue to purchase large size bottles.</li>
      <li>and i bought a large size of it.  </li>
      <li>I will say that I have sensitive/dry skin, but this stuff absolutely destroyed my face.</li>
      <li>for my wife who didn&#x27;t really care for it</li>
      <li>and I have already purchased that because I like it so much.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re very creamy.</li>
      <li>I have battled this my whole life and&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
      <li>She&#x27;s very self-critical though, and doesn&#x27;t see what I see.  </li>
      <li>Makes a big difference on the pocket book when the cost was worth it!</li>
      <li>I purchased this in full size since the tube runs out fast (only .8 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Toner</li>
      <li>I got to try five Andalou Natural products for a very reasonable price.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also highly recommend the age defying spf lotion which I have been using in combination with this kit.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the cleansing milk doesn&#x27;t remove make-up too well, but my face does feel fresh after I use it.</li>
      <li>It beats many of the high priced products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>It made it tight, dry, and gave me very prominent lines around the eyes.</li>
      <li>For the price I paid for a tiny starter kit, I expected a lot more.</li>
      <li>but I have incredibly sensitive skin whihc loves the serum and both lotions.</li>
      <li>My skin is brighter and soo soft.  </li>
      <li>Thus far, this is the finest quality skincare I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>Even though it said for sensitive skin my skin felt irritated and almost burned after using once.  </li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, there are no benefits to it.</li>
      <li>I really like the way these products make my face look and feel; soft, subtle, and smooth...</li>
      <li>Even though the bottles are small, they could have lasted longer than 4 days if they were filled up.</li>
      <li>- really makes the skin soft and smooth, but I only use this every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Mask - probably my least favorite product and will not repurchase, it was a tad harsh and drying for my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>but the moisturizer really does nothing to help my dry skin.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, to the point that I have only been using Cetaphil on my face since everything else makes my face itch, break out in hives or acne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Even though it said for sensitive skin my skin felt irritated and almost burned after using once.  I returned this product</li>
    <li> Not thrilled.  I usually use Jurlique, but I thought let me try something different.  I was not impressed and notice nothing special.  Not even a deep moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This set worked well on a recent trip; great products in convenient travel size.</li>
    <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> love how it makes my skin feel, only 1 week into so I don&#x27;t know yet but so far so good</li>
    <li> Well, oddly enough, I got two perfecting creams, and no fruit enzyme mask. Which is kind of a bummer because that&#x27;s what I was really looking forward to trying. First night using, my face is clean and moisturized. I&#x27;m not blown away or anything, but I guess it did what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I am 40 and my skin looks better now than it ever has.  I have had acne prone oily skin since I hit puberty.  I have battled this my whole life and&lt;br /&gt;have never been able to go without makeup to cover it up.  As 40 crept up on me my skin started to get clearer, but from all the years of drying&lt;br /&gt;acne products the texture was terrible and I started noticing crows feet and laugh lines.  I was looking for a natural non GMO product for my skin when I came across a container of the Lift and Firm cream at Marshalls.  I decided to try it and within two days I started to notice a difference in the texture of my skin.  I liked it so much I decided to buy the Get Started Age Defying Kit to try some of the other products.  I am IN LOVE with these products.  My skin is brighter and soo soft.  The dark spots and scars even seem to have faded.  The texture of my skin has improved 200%.  I have now purchased several other products and I can&#x27;t praise them enough.  For the first time since I hit puberty I can go without makeup and look great!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to try the product before purchasing &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34;, It does what it says, and was very affordable! Makes a big difference on the pocket book when the cost was worth it!</li>
    <li> I really love this whole line. My face has never been softer or more moisturized. Very impressed! Will continue to purchase large size bottles.</li>
    <li> Great starter kit. Just enough product in each one to last a little over a week. So far no bad reaction. It&#x27;s moisturizing for my extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> The value of the contents are well worth the try, but the bottles were not filled up. Even though the bottles are small, they could have lasted longer than 4 days if they were filled up. Still a good product, and recommend to anyone on the go that wants to keep their skin clean.</li>
    <li> for my wife who didn&#x27;t really care for it</li>
    <li> I would suggest that Andalou make a travel kit without the facial mask and perfecting cream and charge alittle less. How many people when traveling use facial masks! Concentrate on the cleansers, toner and day and night cream and charge alittle less. It is an excellent product though and would recommend it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and a super way to try the whole line. My skin did not seem to care for he mask but I have incredibly sensitive skin whihc loves the serum and both lotions.</li>
    <li> Love these products. I used Arbonne for several years and had to find something comparable since Arbonne changed its formulas.  The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because the cleansing milk doesn&#x27;t remove make-up too well, but my face does feel fresh after I use it. The toner does remove make-up, but that&#x27;s not its primary job.  Overall, I will definitely continue to purchase these products.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works really well. Replaces expensive cream.</li>
    <li> I bought the &amp;#34;samples&amp;#34; to see if I like it and did not find the product to be any better than Olay Regenerist.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of non chemical, non gmo cleansers. However, the cleanser in this product did not &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; my skin at all. Especially after wearing makeup. Even on days when I wore no make up, when I would apply the toner the cotton ball would be covered with dirt and grime from my face that I had just supposedly cleaned with cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer and face mask made my skin feel amazing after using them.&lt;br /&gt;I used as directed and noticed no improvement in my skin and I have a small spot of sun damaged skin on my forehead that did not &amp;#34;lighten&amp;#34; up at all as promised. No other blemishes became less pronounced either.&lt;br /&gt;As I stated in the title, it is a great concept but over all it just did not deliver as promised. For the price I paid for a tiny starter kit, I expected a lot more.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, to the point that I have only been using Cetaphil on my face since everything else makes my face itch, break out in hives or acne.  Andalou Naturals actually feels good on my skin.  All the products in this kit smell very heavenly, a mild fruity scent and not overpowering.  It is also good to try them out first before you commit to full sizes.  I have lost so much money trying out natural face products and so far I have not been impressed until I used this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser - smells great, very mild, my favorite product in the kit.  I purchased this in full size since the tube runs out fast (only .8 oz)&lt;br /&gt;Toner - really makes the skin soft and smooth, but I only use this every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Mask - probably my least favorite product and will not repurchase, it was a tad harsh and drying for my sensitive skin.  At first it gave me a few hives on the face, which gradually went away after a day.  It dried my skin and gave it a little peel, but I do have to say, after my skin peeled (probably on the third or fourth day), the result was amazing.  I just do not like the reaction I got at first and I&#x27;m not a fan of peels.  It says on the instructions to use it 2-3x a week, but I think it may be sufficient for most to use it once a week only.&lt;br /&gt;The two creams are in the kit a day and night cream.  They both are very mild and I like using them.  I have been only using the kit for about a week and a half and my skin is completely free of acne and feels a lot smoother before I used the product.  I also highly recommend the age defying spf lotion which I have been using in combination with this kit.  Overall, a great buy.  I bumped it down to 4 stars because of the mask.</li>
    <li> Sunspots are fading! wrinkles less than 2 months ago! Love it.  ALL of it!</li>
    <li> Not a fan. I will say that I have sensitive/dry skin, but this stuff absolutely destroyed my face. It made it tight, dry, and gave me very prominent lines around the eyes. It may work well for people with oily skin, or living in a more humid climate (I am in Colorado); however, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> Once you try this sample you will purchase the full size....this product line is amazing!  I especially like the face wash and night creme.  It beats many of the high priced products I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I appreciate the sample set to try the products before purchasing a full sized set.  Products are expensive but I have paid out more $ than this and been disappointed.  This is quality.  I love the whole set and am saving up to buy the full size versions.  Shop around.  I have see other sellers carry some of their products with a little savings.</li>
    <li> Very nice set. Great for traveling!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this entire line.  My friend recommended this product and once I tried the sample pack I was sold.</li>
    <li> i am 68, have dry skin.  i found these products, in this kit, to be drying.  i do like the apricot face wash and i bought a large size of it.  but the moisturizer really does nothing to help my dry skin.  andalou products all smell good, though.  that&#x27;s a nice thing.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this was a great sample kit. I got to try five Andalou Natural products for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The probiotic cleansing milk didn&#x27;t do very much for me. It didn&#x27;t clean my pores. I like an almost squeaky clean finish after using a face wash. This would be great for someone with very sensitive, extremely dry skin with no makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toner smells like pickle juice, and it makes my red cheeks flare. As far as I can tell, there are no benefits to it. I think I get more out of my Lush and Michael Todd toners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfecting and night creams smell really good and fruity like most Andalou Naturals products. I&#x27;m not sure I can say much to their benefits. They&#x27;re very creamy. They are not moisturizing, but soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The enzyme exfoliating mask smells great. I think it works pretty well for what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I follow it up with a rich moisturizer.</li>
    <li> So gentle, and just feels so good on your skin. I especially love the cleansing milk and toner. I&#x27;ve yet to try mask that is included.</li>
    <li> I really like the way these products make my face look and feel; soft, subtle, and smooth... Thank you.  I like the sugar scrub as well</li>
    <li> This was an ok deal but the moisturizer doesn&#x27;t work. My skin feels dry and tight after I use it so I have to apply another kind. The toner smells icky. No difference in my skin after having it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Thus far, this is the finest quality skincare I&#x27;ve ever used. One feels pampered knowing the ingredients are top of the line and thei company&#x27;s philosophy further promotes their qualiy of consciousness also.</li>
    <li> I ordered this kit just to try it out since my sister had given me a sample of the perfecting cream, it is wonderful and the one little hereditary wrinkle I have has all but become less noticeable, the face wash was awesome and I have already purchased that because I like it so much. The wonderful pomegrante mask is very good. All of the products were very good and I would recommend them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Love each product in this set. Feels good to use natural ingredients on my skin&lt;br /&gt;Scott&#x27;s wife, Deni</li>
    <li> My Mom was looking for a good skin-care product, and I love Andalou Naturals, so I thought I would purchase this for her for an early Mother&#x27;s Day gift, so she could try out their products.  She didn&#x27;t seem to like it, but I thought that after only a week her skin looked clearer and firmer.  She&#x27;s very self-critical though, and doesn&#x27;t see what I see.  I will continue to purchase Andalou Naturals, but sadly I don&#x27;t think my Mom will.</li>
    <li> I loved all of the items in this set, they worked very well on my skin type.  I&#x27;ll definitely reorder when I run out</li>
    <li> Will order again and again.  I read about this company in FIRST for Women magazine and it was a great find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never felt better!  Thank you Andalou!</li>
