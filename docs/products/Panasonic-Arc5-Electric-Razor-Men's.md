      <li>the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had around my neck and jawline with any kind of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it was great around her knees.</li>

      <li>good luck</li>
      <li>Cost wise</li>
      <li>This is especially true for rotary shavers.    </li>
      <li>The 7 series just isn&#x27;t that good</li>
      <li>but you can tell you just got a good shave when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>I never leave reviews, but for this product I felt I should spread the word about how good this shaver is.</li>
      <li>With my brillo pad wiskers l need about four minutes for a good shave...</li>
      <li>The biggest advantage of having the cleaning unit is that it looks good on the bathroom counter</li>
      <li>but you can tell you just got a good shave when you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>The pop up trimmer is exceptional, I ditched my Andis T Outliner because the Panasonics trimmer works so well.</li>
      <li>Panasonic ES-LV95-S is a great shaver for most.</li>
      <li>I am definitely happy with the Panasonic and will be sticking with it even though it cost me ~ $150 more than the Braun.</li>
      <li>It gives me an amazing shave.  </li>
      <li>I could never get more than one good shave off these blades at three bucks a piece and more.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;10% cannot be pleased ever AND cannot stand good reviews to contradict their negativity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The Panasonic has a nice soapy smell</li>
      <li>The Norelco looks very sleek and has a very nice LCD with all the great features you could ask for.</li>
      <li>and I found it very easy to shave with.  </li>
      <li>I have use blades, shick electric, remington, norelco and this panasonic is best by far.  </li>
      <li>By far the best electric razor I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
      <li>but you have to give it credit for being the first truly great electric shaver.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and</li>
      <li>Using this to shave my head was easy and effective.  </li>
      <li>Well, how many utensils do you rub your face with anyways?&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>are just as good...and even better in some areas.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had top of the line</li>
      <li>However, when the touching my face they always said the side I used the Panasonic on felt smoother without knowing which shave I used.</li>
      <li>Works better than  razor blades that  </li>
      <li>so I consider it a splurge for sure.  </li>
      <li>The way it glides over your face feels more like a massage than a shave.</li>
      <li>The Sonic technology really is more than just some fancy selling point.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>they come up with a way to make it even better.</li>
      <li>but I decided to try something different in that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this device.  </li>
      <li>go more in depth here</li>
      <li>Neither my wife, mother, or mother-in-law were able to tell the difference between the sides when looking at me.</li>
      <li>The shave is better than the ES-LA63-S, which is saying a lot.</li>
      <li>Ok on the to review.  </li>
      <li>So I got this model since it seemed like it&#x27;s supposed to give me a better shave also.    </li>
      <li>The Braun is in my view better , because it is alcohol based</li>
      <li>I decided to google top 10 razors and saw Panasonic was at the top of the list.</li>
      <li>The Braun had more of a vibration to it that almost felt like a massage</li>
      <li>I have buzzed my head closely for many years.  </li>
      <li>just cause I love rotaries but the Braun and Panasonic shaves</li>
      <li>just cause I love rotaries but the Braun and Panasonic shaves</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it comes with a cleaning station.</li>
      <li>My face is used to both rotary and foil shavers, and I assure you I have tested each one for 30 days or more to their fullest</li>
      <li>Smell better too.  </li>
      <li>Better than Braun 7 Series.</li>
      <li>are just as good...and even better in some areas.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the device for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Causes more irritation and cuts than Braun</li>
      <li>, I like Braun 7 series much better.</li>
      <li>I did like the case for the Braun better, but since Panasonic provides a protective cap for the foil it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but otherwise better all around.</li>
      <li>better than a 3 or 4 or 5 blade razor in my case,</li>
      <li>It gives a better shave than a blade.</li>
      <li>The Panasonic improves on this but still needs many passes to achieve desirable results.</li>
      <li>Maybe a separate button for sensor mode would have been better (I know it would raise the cost</li>
      <li>go more in depth here</li>
      <li>Norelco dropped the ball on their latest model.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>Slide it up more and the trimmer pops up.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t see how it could work any better than this thing.</li>
      <li>I just switched to Norelco&#x27;s latest, the 9000 Series which was just launched this month.</li>
      <li>I have tried many, and none of them were able to give me a smooth close shave.  </li>
      <li>It is quieter than I had assumed it would be, lighter in weight than I assumed it would be, and very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Each one has good sturdy weight and if had to predict any of them failing on me, I&#x27;m almost positive that in each case, it would be solely mechanical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I initially bought the Norelco rotary razor 3D and it is a very good razor</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have never used an electric shaver.  Over 50 years of shaving I have tried many, and none of them were able to give me a smooth close shave.  My beard is thick and coarse.  I was forced to buy an electric due to some stitches I received on my neck, and I was shocked at the quality of this shaver.  It gives me an amazing shave.  Even closer than a razor, because I can actually shave against the grain without cutting myself.  I have been using it for a month, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I will never use a razor again.  All that time wasted wetting my skin, buying expensive shave creams to soften the beard, waiting for the beard to soften, cutting myself over and over, the messy clean-up......I am done with it all!  Thank you Panasonic. Update 4/2/15 - The shaver stopped working over a month ago.  Called for warranty service and sent it to Texas, hoping for a new one.  Got it back today, opened the box and found my same broken shaver.  $500 for a shaver that worked for 3 months.  What a mistake.  I also made a mistake buying the version with the cleaning system.  You can get the shaver for $189 and clean it yourself.  It is very easy to clean. Update 12/4/16 - I feel terrible that I forgot to update this review.  After some lengthy discussions with customer service, they did send me a new razor.  It has worked perfectly for over a year, and I liked it so much that I bought the same razor without the cleaning system for travel.  I am still getting a perfectly clean shave with the original razor and have not yet changed the blades or foil.  This is really a fantastic product in spite of my early problems.</li>
    <li> My Arc 4 previous generation shaver got stolen on vacation so I needed to get a replacement upon return. When I saw the price of the new LV 95 model, I hesitated. Went to Best Buy and got the latest Braun instead. After two weeks of using Braun, I picked up LV 95 at Bed Bath and Beyond because Braun kept pulling longer hairs around the beard that I leave out which was rather annoying as well as missing hairs on my neck. LV 95 is the best shaver out there. It&#x27;s super quick and the new cleaning station seems like a huge improvement over the old clunky one that was problematic. They could probably charge a thousand bucks for this shaver  and I would still consider it as nothing beats the shave with this guy. Plus the ease of cleaning makes it a perfect companion for travel.</li>
    <li> By far the best electric razor I have ever owned. Been using Norelco razors for a while and was about to get another one. I decided to google top 10 razors and saw Panasonic was at the top of the list. I didn&#x27;t see this razor at Target or Walmart so I was not even aware it existed. Read the reviews and watched some YouTube videos then took the chance and bought it. Not sure if I needed an arc4 or arc5 but figured I would have it a long time so why not spend the extra cash while I have it :) I used to shave with my electric then again with a Gillette razor to get the spots that get missed no need to do that now and the arc5 cuts through everything afterall each pass has 5 chances to get the hair. I do like the cleaning system as well I was only going to use it once a week or when I thought it was dirty but after trying it the whole thing is like new. I now look forward to shaving it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For negatives I got nothing the price is high but so is the quality. Even if they came out with an arc10 I can&#x27;t see how it could work any better than this thing.</li>
    <li> Today was my first day using this shaver. Although Panasonic says to give it 30 days, the job all over was done superbly.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used. It gives a better shave than a blade. Not necessarily as close, but better. Was using a Braun pulsonic for a while and was never satisfied with its performance on my neck. The arc 5 is a different animal. The pop up trimmer is exceptional, I ditched my Andis T Outliner because the Panasonics trimmer works so well. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> is ok not more then that I had one for 50 $ same  performance&lt;br /&gt;I may return it&lt;br /&gt;long time to shave  re do it 4-7 times to get it ...&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t work well for upper neck at all!&lt;br /&gt;I had to use my shaving knife  as well</li>
    <li> Incredible , and I was using the Braun 799 , this is way better , fast , no irritation on the neck , I have a Norelco that is as fast but burns my neck really bad. So really no comparison this is the one to have. Expensive , yes. But for my beard there is nothing like it. Also comparing the noise is in the middle of the pack.  Just a little more than the Norelco that is the quietest. But it is very quiet compared with the Braun. After one week i&#x27;m very happy.  Cleaning:  The Braun is in my view better , because it is alcohol based and I have a feeling it is cleaner when I pick it up. Smell better too.  The Panasonic has a nice soapy smell but I miss the menthol of the Braun. But actual th panasonic is so easy to clean with some liquid soap and water that I only use the base for the drying , something I could&#x27;t do before with the Braun. So point for the panasonic in the end.  The Norelco I don&#x27;t have the cleaning base and it is easy to wash but something is missing. And the 4 hours drying in the new bases are something to really take into account.  Again , the Panasonic is expensive but it is a generation ahead of the others.   I use the sensor for the speed according to the amount of beard to cut and find it very useful in avoiding burns in the neck.   If I turn it off the neck ( more sensitive skin) sometimes has a little razor burn.  The Norelco used is the Philips Norelco 1250X/46 SensoTouch 3D.  Hope this can help.</li>
    <li> Fantastic.  I have use blades, shick electric, remington, norelco and this panasonic is best by far.  Clean cutting without pulls, close shave and no irritation.  Easy to keep clean and comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> Works better than  razor blades that  you spend $ 25.00 for a couple of weeks.  Also, never cuts you.  This is a very good product.</li>
    <li> My son has this razor and l have a lesser one, yet, as much as l wanted to be amazed by this expensive, make that VERY, it was no better.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, to read about anyone saying it is not worth the price, is worth a laugh, or two.&lt;br /&gt;10% cannot be pleased ever AND cannot stand good reviews to contradict their negativity.&lt;br /&gt;I actually gave up the blade entirely and over the last six months of NOT using the gillet five bkades l saved almost two hundred bucks. I could never get more than one good shave off these blades at three bucks a piece and more.&lt;br /&gt;These Panasonic need a little care as any precision machinery will. I always use it on me in the wet with soap or cream rince. Lubrication on metal is not a bad thing at all. Imagine running your car without oil.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is the key AND very simple. Just run the razor after use and immerse half inch, no more, in water and run it that way for a couple of seconds...that&#x27;s it! Clean as a wistle every time.&lt;br /&gt;Now some will accuse me of being too thourough, but l do dry it quickly with toilet paper and leave it to dry in pieces. I know l know, is it really worth this extra time? Well, how many utensils do you rub your face with anyways?&lt;br /&gt;This thing amazes me every time l use it. With my brillo pad wiskers l need about four minutes for a good shave...nothing made on Earth has ever given me a &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; shave anyway!&lt;br /&gt;One more thing that is a laugh on the negatives, a blade WILL cut you if you are rough on your face...l take it as a serious PLUS that this Panasonic will nick you IF you don&#x27;t respect that it IS a cutting tool of incredible accuracy. I read about those who criticize this &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; for nicking, only happened to me once! The blades on this razor must come very close to the skin to shave properly. Those who keep nicking themselves with it simply need &amp;#34; Shaving 101&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> wow...just recieved and charged to use. i purchased to use on scalp. recently went bald again, last bald was 20+ years ago in army, and forgot how great it feels to go low drag again. anyway, i also got a $20 battery operated panasonic at cvs just to use while i waited for arc5, but also to compare, because someone made a comment that a cheapo one did the same job as the arc5. uh, wrong, theres no comparison. when using on the scalp the acr5 is a bit awkward, its meant for face and not inverted, but by locking the head and holding between middle and ring fingers, it works, still a bit awkward tho, but it shaves fine.i felt no pinching or bites. slight buzz sensation. noise is expected of any electric shaver, buzzzzzzz, not excessive. the end result is, and i admit surprising, very close. almost as close to a straight razor. i periodically use a cut throat on my face, just for the closeness and clean feeling. this arc5 is close. my scalp is soft says my wife. theres plenty of comments on face but few on scalp. so for the ones looking for a scalp shaver.....wow...better than a 3 or 4 or 5 blade razor in my case, no nicks, fast. still have to use the other hand to pull skin around and get the head going just right against the grain, but a few passes and its smooth. the cheapo one took 5-7 passes. i shave daily and have coarse straight hair. my skin is not super sensative so i am able to dig the acr5 a little harder to get into the grain and skin. but for first impressions on the scalp....i would buy as a present if it wasnt so expensive. im sold on this, i just hope it lasts 5-7 years like some people say about panasonic shavers. we will see. even if it didnt i would buy another. good luck</li>
    <li> the best shave ever .</li>
    <li> I had to make the journey from the blade to an electric razor because some of the medications that I was on made it difficult from me to stop any bleeding, even a small nick with a blade.  But before I review this razor, I want to tell you what \\&quot;type\\&quot; of shaver I am.  I do not like scruff.  It is just not for me, I&#x27;m too old and it doesn&#x27;t look good on me.  In addition, I don&#x27;t like the feel of it when I touch my face.  So, I want the closest shave possible.  When I use a blade, I lather and re-lather 3-5 times depending on the day.  Everything, to the smallest hair must be gone.  I initially bought the Norelco rotary razor 3D and it is a very good razor, however, I could not clean my top lip like I wanted to and always seem to have a shadow there.  My son needed a new razor so I gave him the Norelco (he loves it) and purchased the Panasonic.  I love it.  Now, your results may vary but the following are my results.  I end up with a shave that I think is about 97% as close as a blade.  It will take you a couple of weeks to get used to it, but you will.  I want to make one thing clear.  I do not get a fast shave.  For me to get that close of shave takes me seven to ten minutes.  I use a pre-shave, which I will review later. I do not set speed records when it comes to shaving, but I am watching the news while I shave so I don&#x27;t notice the time.  Finally, I have the wet dry cleaning system.  Do I think you need it?  No.  I charge my unit every day because I stick it in the cleaning system and it charges while it cleans.  It takes 20 minutes to clean and 80 minutes to dry.  The biggest advantage of having the cleaning unit is that it looks good on the bathroom counter and my wife doesn&#x27;t complain that it is always out.  So, you don&#x27;t need it and if price is an issue, feel comfortable in not getting it.  If price is not a big issue, and you want to keep your wife happy, go for it.  I hope this helps you make your decision.  I found the Panasonic foil razor to give me a slightly overall closer shave than the Norelco, but that is just me.</li>
    <li> Just received my shaver ES-LV95. Prior to that I had the 8000 4 Arc Panasonic shaver. Immediately, the feel and look are an upgrade. The shave is much more comfortable and requires less passes for a very nice shave. I was reluctant to pay this much for a shaver, but it clearly is the best on the market at this time. Durability and how long the blades last time will only tell. If you have the means financially, then make the purchase and enjoy.</li>
    <li> When I saw the price drop to a more reasonable number (still expensive), I decided to get this to replace an older Panasonic shaver, [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 Men&#x27;s Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]].    At the time I used the ES-LA63-S, I would have considered that to be the best shaver I&#x27;ve used beating Braun, Norelco, etc (I have a review there).    There was no reason to update except I really wanted a cleaning base as I was getting lazy about cleaning it and if I forget to charge it, it was an inconvenience. So I got this model since it seemed like it&#x27;s supposed to give me a better shave also.    The original asking price is ridiculous, but Amazon started selling it recently and the price dropped enough that I couldn&#x27;t resist.    Ok on the to review.  The shave is better than the ES-LA63-S, which is saying a lot. I did irritate my skin for a few days but that is normal with any shaver. Now it&#x27;s normal and I can shave everyday with no issues.    The shaver itself feels cheaper in the hand. I can&#x27;t quantify it. It just feels cheap. The fake chrome shiny plastic doesn&#x27;t help.    I&#x27;m still on the fence about the sensor-controlled motor speed. I can tell it changed from the sound the shaver makes but I don&#x27;t know if it does anything. I&#x27;ve shave with and without it and I find no difference.  It does add an inconvenience though: 1 push turns it on (sensor mode), 1 more push puts it in normal mode, 1 more push to turn it off. So if shaving in sensor mode, you have to push twice to turn off. Or if you want to shave in normal mode, you have to push twice to get to that mode. Maybe a separate button for sensor mode would have been better (I know it would raise the cost but they are charging a lot for it...).    I&#x27;m glad it comes with a cleaning station. Here are some thoughts:  It takes 10 minutes to clean and 80 minutes to dry (with fan blowing).  It&#x27;s water based. They give you an packed and you pour that in the base after adding water. I haven&#x27;t had it log enough to tell if there is going to be sanitary issues. I will keep this review updated. (It&#x27;s interesting that Brauns used to use fans to dry but switched to heat many years ago, I&#x27;m curious if Panasonic will do the same in the future)  Cleaning works well though and it looks unused after it goes through the cycle.    Comparing it to the older ES-LA63-S model:  They fixed the pivot head slider button so it&#x27;s very easy to use: To lock the head, just slide button up (the old model the head had to be aligned just so...). Slide it up more and the trimmer pops up. The trimmer works great by the way.  As I mentioned, the ES-LA63-S was the best shaver I had used, it still missed a few hairs (like 7 hairs) that for some reason it didn&#x27;t like shaving. This shaver has no problem. I finally get a complete shave. (I have a tough fast-growing beard and sensitive skin, ugh).      Just a note: Look at the price history and buy when the price is right: It goes up and down a lot (over $100 difference)</li>
    <li> I received my new Arc 5 shaver today and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it- so I did. It charged in about an hour and the instructions say to disconnect the charge cord once this is done. After a quick review of the included instructions, I DRY shaved my legs!&lt;br /&gt;This is just a first impression, but I was so amazed, I thought I would post this just in case another woman is out there looking for a quality shaver.Living in drought stricken California, I was hoping NOT to shave my legs in the shower any longer. This seems to be the holy grail! My legs are smooth as can be and there was no scraping of my skin whatsoever. I will get brave and try my underarms tomorrow- but for now this far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I did find one reviewer who mentioned she tried it and it was great around her knees. Since that is always the toughest place, I decided to try it. I am so glad I did.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace an older Remington r7130. I am active duty military and have to shave daily, so I wanted to get a shaver that would give me a fast, close shave. My old Remington wasn&#x27;t working the best even after replacing the blades and cleaning it regularly so I wanted to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read reviews that the Panasonic ES-LV95-S and Braun 799cc were two of the best foil shavers and decided to compare them. I have thick facial hair with tough skin on my face, but sensitive skin on my neck and was hoping that these two would cause less irritation on my neck than my old Remington. I only tested these two shavers dry, but here&#x27;s how it went for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound and Feel:  The Panasonic was slightly louder than the Braun, but it was most likely due to the fact that it had a higher pitch since it runs at 14,000 cycles per minute vs. Braun&#x27;s 10,000 vibrations per minute. I wouldn&#x27;t describe either as being too loud since they didn&#x27;t bother my wife or dog that were sleeping in the next room at 530 AM. The Panasonic felt like the foil got warm when it was shaving, but wasn&#x27;t hot or annoying. You could definitely tell that it was giving you a close shave. The Braun had more of a vibration to it that almost felt like a massage and you couldn&#x27;t really tell it was cutting the hairs, but it was. Overall I would say the Braun sounded and felt slightly better than the Panasonic when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Quality:  I tested the two shavers daily for a week then with two days growth when on leave by shaving half my face with the Panasonic and half with the Braun. Neither my wife, mother, or mother-in-law were able to tell the difference between the sides when looking at me. However, when the touching my face they always said the side I used the Panasonic on felt smoother without knowing which shave I used. Also, the side the Panasonic was used on took longer for my five o&#x27;clock shadow to show up than the side with the Braun, but just slightly. I would say that the Panasonic definitely provides a closer shave than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Time and Cleaning Ease:  I was able to get as close a shave as possible on the Panasonic side approximately one minute faster than the Braun&#x27;s side every time with about 2 minutes for the Panasonic vs. 3 minutes for the Braun. It is easier to manually rinse the Panasonic as well since it&#x27;s foil and blades are separate whereas the Braun&#x27;s foil and blades are one unit. I did not compare the cleaning stations as I planned on returning one of the shavers and was more concerned with a fast, quality shave over how well the cleaning unit works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accessories:  The Braun&#x27;s cleaning station looks nicer than the Panasonic&#x27;s and other reviews say that it works better, but like I said earlier, I did not compare the cleaning stations. The charging cords can plug into the back of their respective shavers or cleaning stations, so there&#x27;s really no difference in charging options. The carrying case for the Braun was a hard clam shell design while the Panasonic was a soft leather. I did like the case for the Braun better, but since Panasonic provides a protective cap for the foil it wasn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: For a dry shave the Panasonic consistently provided a higher quality shave in a shorter time. I did not test the wet shave of either. It did seem that the Panasonic would provide a better wet shave as well since it would be easier to rinse hair and shaving cream from its foil and blades than the Braun. I am definitely happy with the Panasonic and will be sticking with it even though it cost me ~ $150 more than the Braun. The shave quality and speed was worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the dry shave of the Panasonic was nearly as close of a shave as using a Schick Hydro 5 razor with shaving cream. The razor (with new blades) got slightly closer, but the Panasonic had less irritation and no chance of dealing with any cuts when in a hurry.I am pleasantly surprised with how well this shaver works.I am pleasantly surprised with how well this shaver works.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever used.  I can&#x27;t find the cleaning solution at any local retailers, and when I ordered it from panasonic they were on back order.  Wish I ordered some before I was close to my replacement time.  Otherwise I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> This thing is not worth the price. It is no better than ANY OTHER ELECTRIC RAZOR I have tried. It does OK, but no better than a $20 battery power razor I have. I bought this thing, the most expensive razor around, because it was supposed to be the bee&#x27;s knees. Definitely NOT worth the money. Get any cheaper razor instead and you&#x27;ll be just as happy.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the same Panasonic shavers and the exact same models I have used over the years</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a 3 year old Panasonic razor. I really enjoy the similarity and the better features of this newer model.</li>
    <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. I&#x27;ve had top of the line Braun&#x27;s and prior Panasonic&#x27;s, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had that shaves as close as a straight razor, without the knicks.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for years with an expensive disposable razor, but I recently had shoulder surgery and that was not going to be an option.  I have tried electric shavers in the past but was never happy with the results.  After doing a lot of research, this shaver looked like my best chance of satisfaction.  I am very happily surprised how well this shaver works.  It is very quiet and easy to use, I can only use my left hand (I am right handed) and I found it very easy to shave with.  Even on the first shave I was surprised at how close it shaved and how comfortable it was on my face.  So far I think it was worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I never leave reviews, but for this product I felt I should spread the word about how good this shaver is. I do not have a heavy beard, but I have shaved every day with Gillette blades for years. I started looking for an electric shaver just to vary my routine and try something new. Many years ago I owned and tried a wet/dry electric with disastrous results. It ate my skin even though I was using it wet with shaving cream. After a few tries, I put it away and never used it again. So I had some fears that one of the newer electrics might do the same thing. All my fears vanished after my first use of this new Panasonic Arc5. I had absolutely no skin irritation and a shave as close as my Gillette Fusion razors. It is quieter than I had assumed it would be, lighter in weight than I assumed it would be, and very easy to clean. I am using it wet with shaving cream and that will continue. I have no desire to shave dry, so I cannot comment on that aspect of its performance, but I highly recommend this beautiful instrument for any man who desires a clean, close shave from an electric.</li>
    <li> 2 words, GREAT shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I shaved with this shaver the shave felt much closer compared to all the Braun shavers I ever owned. I honestly really wanted the new 9 series (been a Braun user for ages) but I feel that these are somehow kept scarce by Braun and I was told it&#x27;s an only euro version, which imho is nonsense in this day and age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I am more than happy with this purchase! Thank you Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Started using the ES-LV95-S earlier this year. Not bad overall. Better than Braun 7 Series. Causes more irritation and cuts than Braun but otherwise better all around. Shaves closer and catches more hair in a single pass. The Braun 7 simply refused to shave some hairs along the neck line. The Panasonic improves on this but still needs many passes to achieve desirable results. That&#x27;s one drawback of electric shavers.    I don&#x27;t think this shaver is worth $500. I think the realistic price should be $250 but that won&#x27;t happen. The shaver itself is made in Japan which is a plus. The 5 blade head is huge but it isn&#x27;t unmanageable. The cleaning solution lasts a really long time which is a plus. I haven&#x27;t changed mine in months and it still doesn&#x27;t need replacing. I do rinse all the hair off under tap first before using cleaning station and I recommend you do the same. It is easy to clean even without the station.    There isn&#x27;t much difference between this and ES-LV81-K. The cleaning station is improved. A new stubble sensor which adjusts speed has been added. I rarely used this feature. I prefer full power. I think the sensor is really just a gimmick. It may work for some but I don&#x27;t see the point of it. The last difference is the foil slits are slightly improved but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in overall shave quality.    Each person is a fan of different types of shavers. I just switched to Norelco&#x27;s latest, the 9000 Series which was just launched this month. This shaver doesn&#x27;t pull like the foil shavers do. With the foil shavers I need to use the pop-up trimmer to cut down the hair first before using the main foil. The Norelco doesn&#x27;t need that. I had previously used a Sensotouch 3D which was replaced with the new 9000 Series (9300 and 9700). The Norelco is also significantly quieter than the foils. (Update 12/16/2014: Norelco dropped the ball on their latest model. The previous Sensotouch 3D with original RQ12 head is better)    You MUST use the exact same shaver exclusively for 4-6 weeks before reaching the optimal level of performance. Don&#x27;t get frustrated if the first few shaves aren&#x27;t great. It takes time for the hair to grow out in the way that the shaver cuts best. This is written in every instruction manual and I know this from personal experience. This is especially true for rotary shavers.    I have found electric shavers are not for daily use. Sure you can use them daily but from my experience all of them require some growth beyond a day to work well.    If you want a foil shaver I say get a Panasonic. The Arc 4 might be a better overall value. You don&#x27;t really need the shaving sensor or cleaning station so if you can find significant savings by omitting those two you&#x27;d be better off.  Somewhere along the line Braun lost its way. The 7 series just isn&#x27;t that good and I had mine for four years. For me, the Norelco wins because it is under $200 (at Costco) and the all around performance is very good especially over time. I find myself going back to Norelco after trying various foil razors and I think I will stick with it.    Summary: Everyone is different. Panasonic ES-LV95-S is a great shaver for most. Definitely best foil shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> Best razor I have ever had.  Blows my old braun series 7 out of the water.  So much closer and quieter.  I do like the braun&#x27;s quick clean feature though and think this would have been nice on here.  Either way it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I want to start out by saying that these are all 5 star electric shavers and I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with either of them. For what it&#x27;s worth I&#x27;m a verified purchaser of each one. My face is used to both rotary and foil shavers, and I assure you I have tested each one for 30 days or more to their fullest potential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look and design:&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is less flashy than the other two but still has all the great features. The hygiene meter at the bottom is really a nice touch for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have the base, or does but wants to cut down on solution usage. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and&lt;br /&gt;maneuver around your face. The Norelco looks very sleek and has a very nice LCD with all the great features you could ask for. It also feels very natural in the hand and the 3D gimmick, isn&#x27;t as gimmicky as I suspected. We&#x27;ll go more into depth with that later on in shaving performance. Out of the three, the Panasonic is the oddest feeling. This new ES-LV95 is a lot more natural feeling in the hand compared to the slightly older ES-LV81. It&#x27;s still a little top heavy but makes up for it with and amazing new feature I&#x27;ll mention later on below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality:&lt;br /&gt;While all three feel very solid and of high quality, the Braun really stands out. All are made out of plastic but the Braun&#x27;s more matte finish personally feels more durable to me. The others by no means feel cheap though. They each have rubbery grips. The grips on the Braun and Panasonic feel more solid and rigid, while the Norelco&#x27;s has a really nice silky feel to it. Each one has good sturdy weight and if had to predict any of them failing on me, I&#x27;m almost positive that in each case, it would be solely mechanical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning:&lt;br /&gt;All three shavers have great cleaning stations that combined with proper care, can result in a shaver that feels like new every time you use it. The cleaning solutions for each one are roughly the same price at around $5 each month. I can&#x27;t fault either one but I feel like the Braun&#x27;s is the best. It&#x27;s fast, quiet, and adds a fresh smell to the shaver. When it comes to manual cleaning, it&#x27;s a completely different story. The Norelco and Panasonic are extremely easy to clean manually with the Norelco being just a little easier. The Braun on the other hand is somewhat of an annoyance. The other two are is simple as holding under the faucet for about a minute and sometimes adding liquid soap. Since the Brauns head is all one piece, you really have to go deep in there with a brush, or hold it under the faucet much longer to give it that same clean. It&#x27;s nothing that would make me say the cleaning system is a must like a lot of others do but it&#x27;s a little extra work for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving:&lt;br /&gt;Yup, it&#x27;s what you&#x27;ve all been waiting for. After months of use between these three shavers I&#x27;m happy to say that they are all great! We&#x27;ll start off with the Braun. It is without a doubt the most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. The Sonic technology really is more than just some fancy selling point. The way it glides over your face feels more like a massage than a shave. The OptiFoil catches every hair and cuts it below the skin, and the ActiveLift gets even the flattest hairs on your neck. This is without a doubt the most innovative shaver since the first electric and you have to respect that it really set the tone for modern day electric shaving. When you see the things Panasonic offers, it&#x27;s easy to write the Braun off but you have to give it credit for being the first truly great electric shaver. Even four years into it&#x27;s life it&#x27;s arguably still the best shaver on the market. Just when you think it&#x27;s about to finally meet it&#x27;s match they come up with a way to make it even better. Now that there are models that support wet shaving, I can&#x27;t think of any reason not to consider it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the Braun has it&#x27;s shortcomings the Norelco 3D really shines. The 3D heads(like the Braun&#x27;s Sonic technology) is muchmore than just a gimmick. The ability to flex outwards helps give as close of a shave around the neck and jawline as you can get with an electric shaver at the moment. It&#x27;s without a doubt my personal favorite of the three and my main shaver. In the dry shaving area the two foils do get closer on my cheeks, but the difference is very minimal and nothing you can really notice until a few hours later. All shave below the skin for a razor smooth feel but it just seems like the Norelco doesn&#x27;t get as deep since the shadow comes back faster. It&#x27;s also extremely quiet unlike the Braun and Panasonic which sound like chainsaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have this brand new Panasonic which manages to be even better than the ES-LV81. It added the Sensor technology which can sense the length of stubble and adjust the speed specifically for each area it goes over. It results in getting an amazingly clean shave with just one or two passes. It doesn&#x27;t feel as comfortable as the Braun but at the end of the day, what does? You can&#x27;t really call it irritating either but you can tell you just got a good shave when you&#x27;re done. The big head makes it hard to get around goatees and sideburns like the Norelco, it just takes time to get used to it. Overall I would say the dry shave is slightly better with the two foil shavers but not enough to persuade your opinion. With the end result being the same your choice is really between the comfort of the Braun, maneuverability of the Norelco, or speed of the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaving:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d go more in depth here but not much to say. The Braun and Panasonic give me the exact same shave when wet as they do dry but with a little more comfort. This is where the Norelco really shines though. The wet shave it does is on par with the Braun/Panasonic closeness but combined with amazing comfort and one of the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had around my neck and jawline with any kind of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day all three are amazing shavers and neither is a wrong buy. You simply just have to weigh your options. I&#x27;ll probably stick to my Norelco just cause I love rotaries but the Braun and Panasonic shaves are just as good...and even better in some areas. Whatever you choose, you won&#x27;t regret it.

    <li> I recently purchased this.  It&#x27;s very pricey so I consider it a splurge for sure.  I had a high end Philips Norelco but I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement head so I decided to try something different. I tend to shy away from extras like cleaning/charging docs but I decided to try something different in that area as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with this device.  Solid construction.  Excellent performance.  I like the shave I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Partly I decided to get this to try shaving my head.  I have buzzed my head closely for many years.  So I buzzed my head at a 0.8mm setting with the Panasonic ER1611.  Then I shaved with this.  Using this to shave my head was easy and effective.  I am pleased with the device for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some nitpicks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a *lot* to learn about operating the device and the cleaning/charging station.  It&#x27;s pretty involved.  I am turned off by such complexity.  I&#x27;ve had to keep the manual handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning makes a periodic intermittent buzzing noise (beyond the vibration noise) that I don&#x27;t see in the manual.  It&#x27;s annoyingly loud.</li>
    <li> Its heavy, inflexible and did not do a good job overall, I like Braun 7 series much better.</li>
    <li> I have used several older models of the panasonic shavers for year.  This one does to a better job of get hairs the other ones had trouble with.  Its a few small improvements over the cheaper models and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The battery also lasts a long time.  Cost wise I think its overpriced relative to the benefits over the cheaper models.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as soon as Amazon dropped the price . I am coming from a Panasonic ES8066 which I have had for 14 years ( same battery multiple foil replacements) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LV95 feels much cheaper then my older 8066 , I have my doubts that this will make it another 14 years but the shave is hands down the best I have had and I experienced no irritation ( likely because of the 30 passes I needed with my old ES  is down to 3-4) Panasonic hands down makes the best shavers.</li>
    <li> This shaver exceeded my expectations. It comes very close to the shave that I can get with manual razer. I&#x27;ve only ever used other foil shavers in the past (the last one also bring a Panasonic which lasted me over 15 years) and this is by far and away the best that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re undecided about the charging/cleaning station, then I would say that it probably isn&#x27;t worth paying much extra for it.  You&#x27;re not supposed to charge the unit every day but if you put it in the station, it will automatically charge it. It is said that daily charging may lead to a shortened battery life so I only put it in the cleaning station weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also you wouldn&#x27;t want to clean it if there&#x27;s some one sleeping close by because it makes a terribly loud noise when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you get what you pay for because this shaver isn&#x27;t by any means the best priced shaver on the market (as of Aug 2014), but the shave will be hard to beat!</li>
