      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>

      <li>Good mouthwash,</li>
      <li>Good taste, but</li>
      <li>AS GOOD AS IT MIGHT BE - it is way overpriced .</li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Tastes good and leaves my mouth refreshed.</li>
      <li>Worth the price to know I am using the best acid protection for my teeth, as well as the good taste, and No alcohol.</li>
      <li>love this -great</li>
      <li>Very interesting that the inactive ingredients are not listed here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite mouthwash, as I already use the ProNamel Toothpaste!  </li>
      <li>I need so much more of this!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I love it!</li>
      <li>Best in the market, not too strong and light for the mouth.</li>
      <li>in  my own opinion  </li>
      <li>Some say they do not like the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; but also found the product as effective as I.  </li>
      <li>the taste  is really  nice and minty  </li>
      <li>It is great because it is a mild flavor</li>
      <li>In addition I found the ACT mouthwash to leave my teeth looking better and feeling very smooth as if a protective layer had been placed on them.  </li>
      <li>I love Sensodyne Proenamel Mouthwash.</li>
      <li>I suggest the crest (in the purple bottle) equivalent as it does more things to improve your teeth health</li>
      <li>I do find the Sensodyne Pronamel Mouthwash to be better than most mouthwashes beyond the two issues of cost and staining.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel better and look better since using.</li>
      <li>This product arrived with the top cracked.  </li>
      <li>My favorite mouthwash.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since it arrived because I can&#x27;t see the expiration date.</li>
      <li>Love this product wish it was still available</li>
      <li>The product is great but the cap broke at the top, not the threaded portion so the mouthwash just leaks out if not careful</li>
      <li>not exactly the greatest mouthwash i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many fluoride mouthwashes and this is the best, both for effectiveness and because it isn&#x27;t as harsh as the Listerine ones.</li>
      <li>Huge difference.</li>
      <li>This is such a great mouthwash and is recommended by dentists.</li>
      <li>that it is available via Amazon, I will consider purchasing it, IF they make it available through their Subscription Service.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ll stick to others available in the stores, also,</li>
      <li>, my teeth look also more clear, its good choice  also to clean and to care for your enamel health, thanks</li>
      <li>Most other mouthwashes are good for both your teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>Frankly, the flavor is incidental for me sense it is not as lingering as many of the other popular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, be aware that burns your mouth, specially the tongue.</li>
      <li>about 10 days after you start using this stuff when you smile at yourself in the mirror.</li>
      <li>I use ~10 ml twice a day, morning and night to keep that fresh feeling.  </li>
      <li>I might not have spelled one or two of those right.</li>
      <li>It seems to be MY perfect solution ....... at least twice a day!!</li>
      <li>However, my teeth feel incredibly clean coupled with this and the new repair and protect toothpaste.</li>
      <li>So I will bite the bullet and keep buying it, but elsewhere and in the larger size as that&#x27;s the better value.</li>
      <li>My favorite and I cannot seem to find it anywhere locally.</li>
      <li>I really like it, leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>I just tried out this mouthwash for the first time.</li>
      <li>so he is willing to use it.</li>
      <li>Great flavor, but too small of a bottle!</li>
      <li>my experience, this alcohol-free, product is very effective in cleaning, leaves little or no aftertaste, does not \\&quot;taint\\&quot; the flavor of food or drink after using, and does not cause discomfort to my mouth and sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>Tried other brands and this is the best non alcohol mouthwash for sensitive teeth or dry mouth sufferers.</li>
      <li>Yet, it really protects your teeth from sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Before buying, look at home in a measuring cup how much 8.4 ounces are.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully, it will gain enough recognition for them to keep it available in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so  it worked very well for me ..</li>
      <li>Also do we really beleive that a mouth wash would help rebuild the enamel?  </li>
      <li>and i must say it helped out with my sensitive teeth and gums it  helped with the pain.!!!</li>
      <li>Just seems like a better product than other fluoride rinses I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Other mouth washes work better.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, you may be able find the product on some Wal-Mart Store shelves for a little under 5 bucks.  </li>
      <li>And thanks for supporting human rights to by taking your adverts off the DD show.</li>
      <li>Kind of slimey and thick tasting.</li>
      <li>and but a new one...</li>
      <li>also, there was really no more benefit than the mouthwash made by the company that uses a famous scientist&#x27;s name.</li>
      <li>Feels like other mouth wash, and it doesn&#x27;t have any unique ingredients in it for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Because the soft enamel, sensitive teeth run in my family, I have given this product as gifts to others.  </li>
      <li>Seems to be working for me, teeth not as sensitive.</li>
      <li>I got this because I have sensitive teeth and my dentist recommended this brand of toothpaste.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than other brands and getting it through Amazon is a MUCH better deal.</li>
      <li>I was using Natural Dentist mouthwash, which is not artificially sweet, and this one is too sweet in comparison.</li>
      <li>Because it was only available in the UK, I initially ordered it on Amazon.co.uk, then later through case purchase, via an international online UK pharmacy.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t think it was helping at first, but noticed over a period of time that indeed my teeth had become less sensitive than they had been just using the toothpaste alone.</li>
      <li>In the past I wrote and called GSK several times asking them to make this product available somewhere in North America and got equivocal responses.  </li>
      <li>I was horrified when I starting getting sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Sensodyne pronamel mouthwash is the only thing my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Worse yet, many people may damage their teeth by trying to scrape off the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So really for what you get the extra fluoride really is not worth it</li>
      <li>Very pricy due to floride ??!!</li>

<li> i have teeth sensitive to hot and cold, so I use this every morning and before bedtime....</li>
<li> this size is entirely too small, and the other size offered is ever smaller.  </li>
<li> went to the trouble of reading the miniscule print that lists the &amp;#34;inactive ingredients&amp;#34; in this mouthwash, on a bottle I bought at the supermarket: water, glycerin, sorbitol, poloxamer 338, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, VP/VA copolymer, sodium benzoate, cellulose gum, flavor, methyparaben, prophyparaben, CETYLPYRIDIUM CHLORIDE, sodium saccharin, xanthan gum, disodium phosphate, sodium phosphate, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1.</li>
<li> For some unknown reason, I cannot find it in NYC pharmacies.  </li>
<li> The print was SO small that I really could hardly read it.</li>
<li> Also, extremely overpriced compared to alternatives.</li>
<li> I have issues with sensitivity due to receding gums and enamel erosion from chronic gastric reflux.  </li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining after using two of these small bottles and rinsing daily.</li>
<li> It leaves you with the taste of glycerin in your mouth as it&#x27;s one of the active ingredients.</li>

    <li> I have been using this mouthwash for about 2 years, now.  Because it was only available in the UK, I initially ordered it on Amazon.co.uk, then later through case purchase, via an international online UK pharmacy.  It was DARN expensive, but I bit the proverbial bullet and paid the price because I have SENSITIVE teeth, soft enamel, and very bad experiences with some popular mouthwash available in the USA.  I even reviewed a couple on the Amazon.  In the past I wrote and called GSK several times asking them to make this product available somewhere in North America and got equivocal responses.  Hopefully, it will gain enough recognition for them to keep it available in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience, this alcohol-free, product is very effective in cleaning, leaves little or no aftertaste, does not \\&quot;taint\\&quot; the flavor of food or drink after using, and does not cause discomfort to my mouth and sensitive teeth.  I use ~10 ml twice a day, morning and night to keep that fresh feeling.  It leaves me with the same sensation of dental cleanliness that I get from my dental cleaning appointments.  Because the soft enamel, sensitive teeth run in my family, I have given this product as gifts to others.  Some say they do not like the \\&quot;flavor\\&quot; but also found the product as effective as I.  Frankly, the flavor is incidental for me sense it is not as lingering as many of the other popular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that it is available via Amazon, I will consider purchasing it, IF they make it available through their Subscription Service.  Otherwise, you may be able find the product on some Wal-Mart Store shelves for a little under 5 bucks.  For now, Wal-Mart is my best buy.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since it arrived because I can&#x27;t see the expiration date. All I can see is the year....2015, but no month or day. It can be expired for all I know.</li>
    <li> I love Sensodyne Proenamel Mouthwash. It should be sold in stores.</li>
    <li> not exactly the greatest mouthwash i&#x27;ve used.  i&#x27;ll stick to others available in the stores, also, this size is entirely too small, and the other size offered is ever smaller.  not sold in my grocery or drug store, so i won&#x27;t be using it again.  also, there was really no more benefit than the mouthwash made by the company that uses a famous scientist&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> seems to be helping my enamel i would recommend it, will update later</li>
    <li> This product is SMALL, it is 8 ozs.  Go grab a measuring cup and put 1 cup of water in it, thats all you get!!  For the price I get 1.5L from walmart for Listerine.  Also the only difference is that listerine has .02 (.01 fluoride ion) fluoride and this stuff has .05 (.02 fluoride ion)  So really for what you get the extra fluoride really is not worth it IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT::  I had to edit this review as I realized that I gave the product 1 star based on its marketing and value which was wrong.  The product works as advertised but is a very bad value.</li>
    <li> Per my Dentist this is best ???!!!??? Very pricy due to floride ??!!</li>
    <li> This product serves its purpose. However, be aware that burns your mouth, specially the tongue. Is hard because you have to hold it for a minute, while your tongue is burning! Yet, it really protects your teeth from sensitivity.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my favorite mouthwash, as I already use the ProNamel Toothpaste!  Tastes good and leaves my mouth refreshed.</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash.  Worth the price to know I am using the best acid protection for my teeth, as well as the good taste, and No alcohol.</li>
    <li> This is such a great mouthwash and is recommended by dentists. AS GOOD AS IT MIGHT BE - it is way overpriced .</li>
    <li> Tiny bottle!!! Other mouth washes work better. I suggest the crest (in the purple bottle) equivalent as it does more things to improve your teeth health</li>
    <li> Best in the market, not too strong and light for the mouth.</li>
    <li> Not really great. Feels like other mouth wash, and it doesn&#x27;t have any unique ingredients in it for sensitive teeth. So not useful at all. Also, extremely overpriced compared to alternatives.</li>
    <li> The product is great but the cap broke at the top, not the threaded portion so the mouthwash just leaks out if not careful and now that I&#x27;m heading home from college I think I have to throw it out and not use the rest of it and but a new one...</li>
    <li> This is the best fluoride mouthwash I have ever tried.  I have issues with sensitivity due to receding gums and enamel erosion from chronic gastric reflux.  I&#x27;ve tried many fluoride mouthwashes and this is the best, both for effectiveness and because it isn&#x27;t as harsh as the Listerine ones.</li>
    <li> Very interesting that the inactive ingredients are not listed here on Amazon. This brand caught my attention because it has the sodium fluoride I want to protect the enamel of my teeth. But it contains an ingredient, cetylpyridium chloride, that turns teeth black in just a few days of use. It doesn&#x27;t matter that the staining can be removed at your next cleaning; nobody I know is going to want to go around with black-edged teeth for months until then. Worse yet, many people may damage their teeth by trying to scrape off the stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturers need to face the fact that neither cetylpyridium chloride (CPC) nor chlorhexidine/chlorhexidine gluconate are acceptable ingredients because of their staining characteristic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the trouble of reading the miniscule print that lists the &amp;#34;inactive ingredients&amp;#34; in this mouthwash, on a bottle I bought at the supermarket: water, glycerin, sorbitol, poloxamer 338, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil, VP/VA copolymer, sodium benzoate, cellulose gum, flavor, methyparaben, prophyparaben, CETYLPYRIDIUM CHLORIDE, sodium saccharin, xanthan gum, disodium phosphate, sodium phosphate, FD&amp;C Blue No. 1. I might not have spelled one or two of those right. The print was SO small that I really could hardly read it. Good way of discouraging knowledge of ingredients, IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, neg my review because I&#x27;m saying something you don&#x27;t want to hear. Go ahead, stick your head in the sand. I hope you&#x27;re shocked about 10 days after you start using this stuff when you smile at yourself in the mirror. Unless you&#x27;ve JUST had your teeth cleaned, you&#x27;ll suddenly realize what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash, hate that it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the toothpaste. Seems to be working for me, teeth not as sensitive. Well keep using.</li>
    <li> My favorite and I cannot seem to find it anywhere locally. Thankfully Amazon has it, although a little on the expensive side I&#x27;m happy I found it.</li>
    <li> The one fault was that the caps were cracked when I received them but I attribute that to the shipping company. Otherwise, I love it! I think though that you have to keep using it for it to continually work. If you stop or switch to something else, you may notice that tooth sensitivity returns. At least it does for me.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product even though I use Sensodyne Pronamel toothpaste.  The cost is $.53 an ounce compared to an alternate product like ACT [[ASIN:B001MIZMJS ACT Restoring Mouthwash Splash 18 Ounce]] which is $.22/oz.  In addition I found the ACT mouthwash to leave my teeth looking better and feeling very smooth as if a protective layer had been placed on them.  I do find the Sensodyne Pronamel Mouthwash to be better than most mouthwashes beyond the two issues of cost and staining.</li>
    <li> in  my own opinion  i tried this mouthwash today and i must say it helped out with my sensitive teeth and gums it  helped with the pain.!!! the taste  is really  nice and minty  made my mouth  feel so  refreshed. so  it worked very well for me .. and i have no problems with it .. i buy it again.!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just seems like a better product than other fluoride rinses I&#x27;ve used. I use this one at night and a cheaper brand of fluoride rinse in the morning. I feel like my enamel is stronger and have no more sensitivity issues. It&#x27;s more expensive than other brands and getting it through Amazon is a MUCH better deal. Some places want 6 bucks for the little bottle.</li>
    <li> No really sure if it does anything</li>
    <li> It seems to be working great in conjunction with the Sensodyne Toothpaste. I have noticed less sensitivity issues with my teeth.</li>
    <li> I was horrified when I starting getting sensitive teeth. Thought I had cavities and the world as I knew it was coming to an end. By luck I went to CVS and bought this rinse. In combination with a Crest flouride/sensitive teeth toothpaste my condition has improved to the point where it is almost not noticeable in less than a month. I will use this product for the rest of my life. Thank you Sensodyne. And thanks for supporting human rights to by taking your adverts off the DD show. Please make bigger bottles!</li>
    <li> Purchased this instead of having to use ProNamel toothpaste even though rather expensive.  Absolutely horrible taste. Kind of slimey and thick tasting.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past two years. Even my dentist was amazed that I stopped going for my usual visits to desensitize my teeth.  For some unknown reason, I cannot find it in NYC pharmacies.  Still looking around as here is way too expensive.  In Europe, I bought a much bigger size at a even lower price.</li>
    <li> I really like it, leaves my mouth feeling fresh. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I need so much more of this! It&#x27;s great. Sensodyne pronamel mouthwash is the only thing my dentist recommends for my sensitive teeth. The bottle is just tiny! It lasted like 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> This product arrived with the top cracked.  The product does nothing for gum health.  Most other mouthwashes are good for both your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good mouthwash, BUT...  Very small bottle.  Before buying, look at home in a measuring cup how much 8.4 ounces are.  Is was definitely not a good value for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product. Along with daily use of the Pronamel toothpaste the sensitivity in my teeth has noticeably decreased.</li>
    <li> Good taste, but I dont think the effect is longer lasting as I feel like using the mouth wash again in 3-5 hours. Also do we really beleive that a mouth wash would help rebuild the enamel?  I think the science is just not there to back it up. Little costly for it&#x27;s size as well.</li>
    <li> I just tried out this mouthwash for the first time. It leaves you with the taste of glycerin in your mouth as it&#x27;s one of the active ingredients. However, my teeth feel incredibly clean coupled with this and the new repair and protect toothpaste. I&#x27;ve got very poor enamel from drinking soft drinks and need to do all I can to re-mineralize my teeth to prevent further irreparable (at least currently) damage and staining of my enamel. Another great product from Sensodyne that I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is excellent. Good flavor, good results. My teeth feel great after I use this.</li>
    <li> love this -great for my teeth- wish I can find it in stores - but haven&#x27;t in any</li>
    <li> Tried other brands and this is the best non alcohol mouthwash for sensitive teeth or dry mouth sufferers. Its not cheap, but it works.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for sensitivity aid.</li>
    <li> Works so much better than listerine or other nasty products I have tried. My teeth feel better and look better since using.</li>
    <li> This was &#x27;advised&#x27; by a dentist, and I think it has made a great difference in the health of my mouth and gums.  I use the Oral B automatic toothbrush, Sensodyne &amp;#34;Repair &amp; Protect&amp;#34; tooth paste, .......... then finished off with this mouthwash!!  It seems to be MY perfect solution ....... at least twice a day!!</li>
    <li> Love this product wish it was still available</li>
    <li> I rinsed with this 5-7x/week. I noticed 2 spots on my front teeth (horrifying). Went to dentist and she said no problem those can be removed. Then she looked inside my mouth and she said my entire mouth was stained (but I couldn&#x27;t see it). After the cleaning/polishing, my teeth were gleaming white again. The staining was so gradual I didn&#x27;t realize how ghetto my teeth looked until after the cleaning. Huge difference.</li>
    <li> i have teeth sensitive to hot and cold, so I use this every morning and before bedtime....sometimes even during the day.  I also coat my mouth guard with it before sticking it in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I got this because I have sensitive teeth and my dentist recommended this brand of toothpaste. Thought I&#x27;d try the mouthwash too. I was using Natural Dentist mouthwash, which is not artificially sweet, and this one is too sweet in comparison. It&#x27;s also a really small bottle so very pricey per ounce. I didn&#x27;t think it was helping at first, but noticed over a period of time that indeed my teeth had become less sensitive than they had been just using the toothpaste alone. So I will bite the bullet and keep buying it, but elsewhere and in the larger size as that&#x27;s the better value. I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining after using two of these small bottles and rinsing daily.</li>
    <li> Only mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t stain my son&#x27;s teeth!!! It is great because it is a mild flavor so he is willing to use it.</li>
    <li> Great flavor, but too small of a bottle!</li>
    <li> I like this mouthwash, my teeth sensitivity lessoned, my teeth look also more clear, its good choice  also to clean and to care for your enamel health, thanks</li>
