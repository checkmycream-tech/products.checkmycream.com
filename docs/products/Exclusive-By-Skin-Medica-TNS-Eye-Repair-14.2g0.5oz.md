      <li>I did notice a lightness of the cream, which I love.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency; it&#x27;s creamy and truly moisturizing, yet it isn&#x27;t super-greasy.</li>
      <li>so something is better than nothing.</li>
      <li>Amazon should monitor this better.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite (and I am a beauty product junkie, so I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
      <li>I love it and intend to use it for years to come.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about 3 years and really love it.  </li>

      <li>However, I almost 30 now and becoming far more aware of the need for truly effective, proven products to keep me looking my best.</li>

      <li>but, I do have fine lines.</li>
      <li>Still, happy enough with the results not to deduct a star over it.</li>
      <li>Sometimes when I have puffy eyes, or have goggle eyes after a swim, applying this product moisturizes and smooths out the lines and reduces the puffiness quickly.</li>
      <li>I bought the TNS Essential Serum from a different merchant and the box was shrink wrapped and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s inevitable to age, but I just want to look my very best as I start the next decade of my life!</li>
      <li>I love my skincare regimen by SkinMedica, it was highly recommended by my dermatologist</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any true wrinkles, but I am a smiley girl, and so I am getting those under eye creases when I smile.</li>
      <li>This eye creme is just right.  </li>
      <li>but I really like it!  </li>
      <li>Not hydrating enough for under the eyes, I was expecting to have better hydration.  </li>
      <li>You really should try it!</li>
      <li>It really does help with those smile creases, and it has ALL of the ingredients I want to be using for wrinkle prevention.</li>
      <li>When I don&#x27;t take it when traveling, I really miss it!  </li>
      <li>and I have tried many different brands.</li>
      <li>I have used it now for several years and am never disappointed!</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon is incredible, and it&#x27;s highly concentrated, so I feel like it will last longer than my other eye creams.</li>
      <li>Really effected my eye area with itching and redness.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product and all of SkinMedica products.</li>
      <li>The box was not in shrink wrap as normal SkinMedica products are.</li>
      <li>Product was represented as &#x27;new&#x27; but was &#x27;used&#x27;.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 29 years old trying to prevent any wrinkling around my&lt;br /&gt;eye</li>
      <li>You will never get the crows feet if you use it early on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been working in dermatology offices for the last 5 years, and I am very picky about what ingredients are in my products.</li>
      <li>I love that its thick</li>
      <li>Its expensive but its a good product.</li>
      <li>A personal skin care product should not be sold as new if it has been opened already.  </li>

      <li>Not too thick or not too light.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for 25 and over age if you have dry skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich without being thick.  </li>
      <li>I thought this was expensive, but our under eye area is the first to show signs of aging, so I figure I am worth it.</li>

<li> so it lasts a long time making the price rather inexpensive.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s in a jar; Skin Medica needs to get with the times and utilize a pump like Neocutis and other luxury brands!</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days</li>
<li> I was hoping for a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes but saw no real improvement.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way</li>
<li> I agree with the other reviewer.</li>
<li> but I didn&#x27;t see any other improvements.</li>
<li> Got started on this with my dermatologist quite a few years ago.</li>
<li> I have used this eye cream for years and bought it from a dermatology office in the past, and decided to see if I could find it cheaper somewhere, so I ordered off of here.  </li>
<li> IT IS NOT THE SAME THING, ITS A FAKE!!  </li>
<li> I cannot see a dramatic difference, but I also use TNS Serum.</li>
<li> A little disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.</li>
<li> Security tape was broken &amp; dirty.</li>
<li> Very sad though.</li>
<li> Gave me a bad reaction.  </li>
<li> I was disappointed when it arrived as it appeared to already have been opened.  </li>
<li> Very bad!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have weary eyes when I put the cream on....I will kept using this till my eye lines disappear and have a youthful looking skin.</li>
    <li> For once an eye cream that gives you results!  Fine lines do diminish and those bags seem to disappear.  You really should try it!</li>
    <li> The results are from this product are very noticeable after only 3 months would definitely recommend this product to women of all ages.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have used it now for several years and am never disappointed!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this for 25 and over age if you have dry skin. You will never get the crows feet if you use it early on.</li>
    <li> What a scam. Product was represented as &#x27;new&#x27; but was &#x27;used&#x27;. Packaging of product was opened. Security tape was broken &amp; dirty. It was clearly pulled back and the container was opened and protective cover was missing. Very bad!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful eye cream. I use it in the a.m. and then again before bed. It&#x27;s rich without being thick.  Keeps the under eye area hydrated without feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> I have used this eye cream for years and bought it from a dermatology office in the past, and decided to see if I could find it cheaper somewhere, so I ordered off of here.  IT IS NOT THE SAME THING, ITS A FAKE!!  I had such a reaction, red, itchy, burning.  Had to stop using it and returning it!!  DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS NOT TNS Eye Repair!!</li>
    <li> This eye creme is just right.  Not too thick or not too light. I use it over Skin Medica Uplifting Eye Serum.  The best I have found and I have tried many different brands.</li>
    <li> I love that its thick but it still penetrates through skin,&lt;br /&gt;I put make up over my eyes with the eyecream, it doesn&#x27;t get clumpy.&lt;br /&gt;My estetican recommended it. I&#x27;m 29 years old trying to prevent any wrinkling around my&lt;br /&gt;eye but, I do have fine lines. Its expensive but its a good product. It doesn&#x27;t have a funky smell to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product and the price was the best I have found online!</li>
    <li> Got started on this with my dermatologist quite a few years ago. I love it and intend to use it for years to come.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good moisterizer but I didn&#x27;t see any other improvements. I was hoping for a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes but saw no real improvement.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviewer. I have purchased this product from my dermatologist for alot more money.  When I saw it here, I thought is was a deal on pricing.  I was disappointed when it arrived as it appeared to already have been opened.  A personal skin care product should not be sold as new if it has been opened already.  Amazon should monitor this better.  [[ASIN:B007HU42SC Exclusive By Skin Medica TNS Eye Repair 14.2g/0.5oz]]</li>
    <li> this stuff is great.  i&#x27;ve been using it for two years now i just can&#x27;t bring myself to try anything else.  it minimizes the tiny lines under my eyes.</li>
    <li> It used to be that relatively inexpensive eye creams and potions from the health-food store did the trick for my under eye area. However, I almost 30 now and becoming far more aware of the need for truly effective, proven products to keep me looking my best. I don&#x27;t have any true wrinkles, but I am a smiley girl, and so I am getting those under eye creases when I smile. I know it&#x27;s inevitable to age, but I just want to look my very best as I start the next decade of my life! I thought this was expensive, but our under eye area is the first to show signs of aging, so I figure I am worth it. That said, I LOVE this stuff!  It really does help with those smile creases, and it has ALL of the ingredients I want to be using for wrinkle prevention. I&#x27;ve been working in dermatology offices for the last 5 years, and I am very picky about what ingredients are in my products. I feel like 98 percent of the stuff out there is just hype without tangible results. This product is backed by science and MD&#x27;s who truly believe in it. Additionally,it goes on so smoothly, and my concealer glides on so nicely afterwards! I love the consistency; it&#x27;s creamy and truly moisturizing, yet it isn&#x27;t super-greasy. The long term effects remain to be seen, but I am really impressed by this product and confident it will continue to deliver results. Additionally, there is a reason so many doctors recommend and use it themselves. The price on Amazon is incredible, and it&#x27;s highly concentrated, so I feel like it will last longer than my other eye creams. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s in a jar; Skin Medica needs to get with the times and utilize a pump like Neocutis and other luxury brands! I don&#x27;t like exposing the ingredients to air twice daily, nor do I like dipping that little clear spoon into my jar and contaminating the product. Still, happy enough with the results not to deduct a star over it.</li>
    <li> Gave me a bad reaction.  Really effected my eye area with itching and redness. My fault for not returning it.</li>
    <li> I love the texture, smell, smoothness.  And it was recommended by a dermatologist.  This is my favorite (and I am a beauty product junkie, so I&#x27;ve tried many).</li>
    <li> The eye cream is a daily regiment in my routine use morning and night.  Great for the under eye area.</li>
    <li> Skin Medica offers the best in skin care, and this product is no exception. Sometimes when I have puffy eyes, or have goggle eyes after a swim, applying this product moisturizes and smooths out the lines and reduces the puffiness quickly.</li>
    <li> Not hydrating enough for under the eyes, I was expecting to have better hydration.  A little disappointed after reading all the rave reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but I really like it!  I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope to see results!</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 years and really love it.  I am 55 years old, and the skin around my eyes looks great. When I don&#x27;t take it when traveling, I really miss it!  Wish I had a travel tube of it!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye care product I have used. A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time making the price rather inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is in my opinion one the best eye cream. SkinMedica is an amazing beauty product(s). I love my skincare regimen by SkinMedica, it was highly recommended by my dermatologist but I couldn&#x27;t afford their prices. Thankfully we can rely on Amazon to provide us with reliable Sellers to fullfill our beauty needs.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and all of SkinMedica products.</li>
    <li> The box was not in shrink wrap as normal SkinMedica products are. Also, the tape used to close the box appears to have been opened then re-closed. I&#x27;m not returning only because I have 3 kids and don&#x27;t want the hassle and I ran out of eye cream last night so something is better than nothing. Very sad though. I bought the TNS Essential Serum from a different merchant and the box was shrink wrapped and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 7 months.  I cannot see a dramatic difference, but I also use TNS Serum. around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I did notice a lightness of the cream, which I love. In addition, the appearance of less wrinkles are wonderful!</li>
    <li> I can not do with out this product.  It makes my 65 year old eyes look 10 years younger.  I always get compliments on not looking my age.  Buy! Buy this product you will be glad you did.</li>
