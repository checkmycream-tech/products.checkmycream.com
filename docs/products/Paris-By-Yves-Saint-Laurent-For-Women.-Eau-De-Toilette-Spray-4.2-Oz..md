<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product.  I actually apply it right in the shower, after the water is turned off.  I have been using Paris for years.</li>
    <li> Yves Saint Laurent, thanks for so many years of great fragrances (my 1st ever was Rive Gauche). I always trade off between Opium and Paris.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She has been using this since her college days in 1990. Tells you how long this particular brand has been on the market. And it never disappoints....you know. Some brands fade away during the day. Not this one. She goes to work with it at seven in the morning and comes home at five in the evening. The scent is just the same as when she put it on nine hours ago..  .</li>
    <li> A love affair for thirty years - A scent that can not be described !</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne and has been for many years.  I&#x27;m so pleased to receive the real product at the best price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Always been my fav since I started using at least twenty years ago...turned others on to it...always get compliments on how great I smell</li>
    <li> The best....my wife just loved it.</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations. I had been looking forward to the fragrance my French house guest had brought with her from France. The scent seemed off.</li>
    <li> Was concerned about purchasing this b/c of several negative reviews on the scent.  I LOVE this scent, have used it for 20+ years, and have a little few drops left in a very old bottle I purchased at &amp;#62;some&amp;#60; dept. store years ago.  I purchased this through a third-party seller (see my seller review) who gave me a guarantee even though Amazon doesn&#x27;t on perfume (flammable liquids/shipping issues).  This bottle is every bit as awesome as the old bottle I got years ago!  It&#x27;s so wonderful, like Springtime in Paris!  LOL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never smelled (could not afford!) the eau de parfume, so maybe ppl are comparing the different products.  Maybe there really WERE some crap knock-offs being sold (many of those reviews are years&#x27; old).  I am in disbelief that I got the LARGE bottle for 65 dolls when I have paid at least 20 more than that many years ago.  There are hints of powder, flowers...not musky or heavy, which I hate, but very delicate.  If I sniff my wrist even a day later (pre-shower), it is still faintly there.  Yes, it WILL smell different on each person, about a half hour after application.  If you never smelled this before, maybe try it out in a store (if you can still find it), but I am extremely happy with my purchase and the seller I used.</li>
    <li> I purchased Paris for my mother who has been a Paris user for years. The stores stopped selling it so I would search the internet for a good price and reputable dealer. The item arrived earlier than expected in excellent packaging. I purchased a larger size just in case I couldn&#x27;t find a good deal in the future. The item is great. Paris has a unique scent and lasts all day. It is very feminine and light. Amazon had the best deal on this item.</li>
    <li> This is truly what I want.  This is the first bottle of perfume from my husband who was only my boyfriend 26 years ago. I still can feel the sweetness every time when i have this perfume sprayed on. Now I wear it every night believing of having sweet dreams.</li>
    <li> I have used Paris since 2002 and I freaked out when my favourite store in fortwayne IN did not carry it anymore. I was so happy that I could finally order it through amazon. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My Chilean wife only really likes the Y.S. Laurant Paris brand of perfume, which is usually much higher priced outside the U.S.A.</li>
    <li> The product was all that it should be and the price was unbelievably low! Great service too!</li>
    <li> It is the only kind my wife uses and will not change. will give away all others or return them to the store.</li>
    <li> It was shipped very fast. It was a gift for someone they really enjoyed receiving it.&lt;br /&gt;The timing was perfect.</li>
    <li> This perfume has always been my favorite! I love how long the scent lasts and how clean and sultry it smells. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I had been trying to fine this perfume for a while. One of my favorites.  Great price</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother&#x27;s 83rd birthday.  She LOVES Paris cologne and was thrilled to receive this.  Great value.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume of all time. Hard to find in usual retail outlets and when you do, price is hugely prohibitive. The only reason I can continue to enjoy this fragrance is through this Amazon vendor. Many thanks!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances. I ALWAYS get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> The perfum is not the original one, it&#x27;s not good quality. The real Paris Yves Saint Laurent stay long  when you spray it, this one as a different smell but not far from Paris&#x27;s one but it goes once you spray it</li>
    <li> My mother has been wearing this perfume for years so I already knew she&#x27;d like her Christmas gift. However, my review is more of fragrance.net, the vendor through which this item came. It arrived in record time and their prices were significantly better than other more commonly known retailers is that I didn&#x27;t find them sooner.</li>
    <li> Delightful light fragrance.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is amazing!  It is a combination of roses and other flowers mixed in...medium weight  cologne.&lt;br /&gt;I think this will be my new favorite! :-) kathy</li>
    <li> Huele a viejitas de 80 años no me gusto nada este perfume. Es un olor hostigante nada agradable arrepentida de comprarlo  porque esta muy caro y huele horrible no malgasten su dinero en esta cosa.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I got a great deal from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years and always get nice compliments on its wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> Does not smell like the perfume version.&lt;br /&gt;Go to a store to smell it before you buy this!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wife did not like it and wasted $75</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;It was wonderful to be able to order this wonder scent for my mom from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It is my favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Purchase is expected to continue in the future. ^^&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. I&#x27;ll take good use.</li>
    <li> Very nice perfume, I really enjoy it on my wife.</li>
    <li> i LOVE IT AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE COLONGE IN THE LAST 25 YEARS. iT HAS A SOFTNESS AND A SCENT THAT LAST ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> This is an old favorite of mine.  It&#x27;s a romantic fragrance;  not too girly yet it&#x27;s feminine.  My husband enjoys this scent on me as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a light floral scent.</li>
    <li> I WAS TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH MY PURCHASE THIS TIME.  I HAVE ORDERED THIS ITEM SEVERAL TIMES FROM AMAZON AND HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED, HOWEVER THIS TIME THE EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY HAD ABSOLUTELY NO SMELL LIKE IT WAS WATERED DOWN OR SOMETHING.  IT DOESN&#x27;T SMELL LIKE THE PARIS I AM USED TO AND HAVE BEEN WEARING FOR MANY YEARS. SORRY TO GIVE POOR REVIEW BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY COMPLIMENTARY ABOUT AMAZON AND THEIR QUICK SHIPMENTS.  DO I NEED TO RETURN AND GET A REPLACEMENT?</li>
    <li> This \\&quot;Eau De Toilette\\&quot; being sold here is a FAKE!! The smell is nowhere near the real one!! And it does NOT stay on as the real YSL Paris Eau De Toilette does either! I have been wearing YSL Paris for years, as it&#x27;s one of my favorite fragrances, and I know this is a FAKE of very poor quality. Don&#x27;t buy this fake product and instead go to your local mall for a real one. Many times they are on sale at your local mall and I wish I had purchased locally as I always do when buying fragrances. On another hand, Amazon.com handled my dissatisfaction with this purchase exceedingly well and gave me a full refund. Product is a looser, Amazon.com is a winner. Thanks Amazon.com!</li>
    <li> Are you kidding me ? It does not smell as the original perfume !!! It is pure alcohol I had no idea something like this could happen on Amazon, lime buy something that is not the real deal. Really disappointed  !</li>
    <li> Bought it for a gift for my neighbor and she loves it.  I have used it for years.  Very beautiful smell.  Many compliments.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance at a great price!</li>
    <li> The scent is a bit week. I have had stronger in the past years.</li>
    <li> My mom has been a loyal fan of this perfume for 20 plus years and it&#x27;s getting increasingly harder to find.  I went to Amazon and found it here thankfully!  I&#x27;ll be coming back for more once my mom runs out, always a good birthday or Christmas present for her!</li>
    <li> just what i ordered and good price too</li>
    <li> One of the lovelist creations from the the couture house that can be had by the average woman. A dress I can&#x27;t afford, but the scent is mine whenever I want.</li>
    <li> I received this 20 years ago from a friend that went to Paris on Vacation, I got a lot of compliments then, people always ask what you are wearing? So believe it or not I still have that empty bottle sitting on my dresser, I am very happy with my purchase and get to relive the past. Every one at work is asking for the name of my perfume. But do I want other people to smell like me at work? Great buy go ahead if you don&#x27;t work with me!</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase.  Paris perfume has been one  of my favorites for  years.  If there has to be a down fall the only one would be maybe a bit less expensive but its not that bad.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00CA2ZRWC Yves Saint Laurent Paris Premieres Roses Eau de Toilette Light Spray for Women, 2 Ounce]]Paris is my every day perfume. I can never get enough of it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful cologne - have been using it for 20 years!</li>
    <li> Actually, my wife loves it and I could only find it through Amazon as it&#x27;s no longer carried by Macy&#x27;s or other department stores.</li>
    <li> I first purchased YSL&#x27;s Paris when it was introduced as a scratch n sniff ad in Vanity Fair decades ago. It is fresh, spring-like, and clean in fragrance. Based on rose petals. It has become harder and harder to get in brick and mortar stores, so getting it online is just the ticket.</li>
    <li> Used this product for a number of years.  This is the least expensive way to get it.</li>
    <li> Good! very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> This fragrance goes on and stays on all day.  I receive many, many compliments on this perfume.  I love, love, love this fragrance.  I recommend, as with any new fragrance, to try a small bottle first to be sure that it has the same effect on the buyer.  Endurance of a fragrance or the way it reacts to skin acidity is different with everyone.  Try before you buy.  I have been purchasing this fragrance for over 10 years and am never without a bottle.</li>
    <li> I loved this scent - new to me after using Evidence - also by St Laurent !</li>
    <li> This is not the product I ordered. Amazon says it cannot be returned, but I have news for Amazon. If the seller will not give me a RMA#, I will simply get a postal confirmation receipt and have my credit card refund my money anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not allow anyone to rip me off without doing something about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been ripped off, don&#x27;t take it lying down.</li>
    <li> Bought this with 1-click where directly below the 1-click button it says:  (Free Shipping. Ships in 1-2 days  once available).  There were plenty in stock.  After 3 days of waiting I see that it won&#x27;t arrive until after a week&#x27;s time.  An inconvenience but I had to make other arrangements as this was a gift.  I figured I could return it, unopened of course, but saw other reviews where they said they could not return it.  Sure enough, even unopened, Amazon won&#x27;t take it back.  Claims it&#x27;s a hazardous/flammable material.  Not so hazardous as to ground ship it to me, why can&#x27;t I return it by same?  This is extremely unfortunate and disappointing and I am leaving my feedback as I&#x27;d hate to see this happen to other, unsuspecting buyers.  The fact that there seems to be a discrepancy with the consistency of the scent is troubling too.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll open it to find out, or try to go the ebay route.  A BAD, albeit rare, experience with Amazon here...</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s a bit different than my usual perfume but its beautieful i would defanetly buy it again.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this favorite perfume of mine I guess it is my trademark. I wear it daily and have for years. A wonderful light clean, floral scent. Not a heavy scent, but it lasts through the day. Good price, as even using it daily it will last over a year easily!</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite fragrances.  Everytime I wear it, I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> so this smells great but unless you like that kind of spray you wont buy it. Go to a store and try it out if you like it then buy it. Its not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Paris by YSL is my favorite perfume. I have worn it for years. I was delighted to find it here for $67 instead of $95 in the stores. Oh, what&#x27;s cheap is expensive!  This is not bona fide Paris perfume even though the packaging is identical down to the sku bar.  It has a strong chemical smell and none of the fabulous rose bouquet that the genuine Paris perfume has.  Amazon will not allow a return on this item.  Caveat emptor!  Buyer beware!  Do not throw away your money - buy the real perfume in a retail store and pay the full price - I wish I had not bought this phony ersatz knock-off.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.Most people asked what the name of the scent you wearing. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> Everything its ok, no problems at all.</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful!!!</li>
    <li> exactly what i wanted, quick shipping, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Been using this forever</li>
    <li> perfect gift ! fast delivery</li>
    <li> My husband bought this perfume for me years ago and it is the only scent that I am comfortable with regardless of the occassion.  Whenever I wear it men and women stop me to ask what scent it is.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, subtle, un-flowery scent that I have worn for over 20 years.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, I just wish it was still available in the US.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite. Floral and feminine.</li>
    <li> It was good service and it got to destination fast and safe, thanks a lot for that, I will count on you in the future</li>
    <li> This has been my signature perfume for over 25 years. Soft and wonderful Eau De Toilette! I have been stopped many times and people will ask \\&quot;what perfume are you wearing?\\&quot; Does not always smell the same on everyone but it sure works for me!</li>
    <li> Seriously this is a wonderful scent created by Yves Saint Laurent not to Paris but to the Parisiennes. It has been around for nearly 30 years and continues as a YsL top seller.  It has a floral scent primarily of roses with a hint of wood tones.  I purchased it for my wife about six years ago. She loved it adopted it as her standard.  The price at Amazon at 33% savings from retail is unbeatable by any of the on-line discounters.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my mother in law. She is a precious person to me but does not spoil herself at all. She has stretched her latest bottle forever and so, her signature fragrance will be under the tree this year as a special treat!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent for years.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and I hope that you continue to offer it on line.  Let me know please if it&#x27;s going to be discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have been using YSL Paris Eau De Toilette since 1986 and this is my favorite potency - The Parfume; (more powdery) is not my personal taste - The Eau De Toilette; is more lively, crystal clear and tenderly pretty and lasting - Full of roses and violets, well blended with ripe berries, all wrapped in vinyl - I will always remember the first time I smelled YSL Paris Eau De Toilette and it will always be at the top of my list</li>
    <li> Love the price and product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> i ordered this as a replacement but it does not smell remotely like the original.  It smells like a black market reproduction.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing YSL Paris Eau de Toilette Spray for ~25 years and know the scent very well.  This product does not smell right!  And, the scent it does have is very short-lived.  So, either this is an imitation product, or it is so old that it degraded in the bottle. Perhaps it had not been stored properly.  I bought this particular item because of the larger size (4.2 oz); perfume shops (and other amazon.com vendors) carry only the smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> Used Paris Eau de toilette and Parfum for years.  Lovely fragrance.</li>
    <li> My mother loves this Eau De Toilette, she has been wearing for years but recently this parfum cannot be found in stores. It made the peferct Christmas gift for someone who was already a lover of this fragance.</li>
    <li> Have been wearing this scent for 20+ years!</li>
    <li> Not as fragrant as I remember</li>
    <li> Good service, good product, my wife was pleased.</li>
    <li> This was my first perfume ever. My dad bought it for me as I requested when I was 15. I&#x27;m 37 now and I long for my Paris from time to time so I have to wear it again. Although I have a few more favorites discovered along the way (  all the Diors, Juicy Couture by JC, Jimmy Choo, Reaction by K. Cole and even Selena Gomez signature perfume)Paris a special one. Very delicious fragance...</li>
    <li> i didnt think it is real, since the last one i bought was at Nordstrom, well it is real thing, and i am very happy i paid so much less $</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for a very long time and being able to get it fast at a very fair price is, well, priceless!</li>
    <li> I love this Toilette...  I have had many compliments on it.  I used to order it from Fragrance.Net....  This bottle was bigger &amp; a better deal..</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for years. It is very light, but has a distinctive fragrance of a fresh rose.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this.  It is not the same as it was.  It has a bad fragrance, as if it has been sitting for years and years.  Amazon won&#x27;t return, so I&#x27;m out $70.</li>
    <li> Many years ago i had a friend go to visit her chef son in Paris and she brought me a bottle of this. I was instantly hooked by the fragrance. Have loved and used this ever since.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I&#x27;ve been wearing Paris since I was seventeen.  I am now forty-four.  It&#x27;s a classic.  And a few years ago, a colleague was standing by me and I thought, wow her perfume is really pretty.  I asked her what it was, and guess what? It was Paris.  After a laugh, I realized that I obviously made a good choice way back when I was in high school.</li>
    <li> This is the YSL PARIS EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY not the YSL PARIS EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY  So it will smell different if your used to The Parfum Spray!    Do some research....  [...]    This smells fantastic BUT not like the Parfum because ITS NOT!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for years, great price.  I will continue to purchase it from Amazon.  Every time I wear it, I get compliments - it is now the only perfume I wear.</li>
    <li> I cannot get enough of this perfume, as it is the only one I can wear.  Always comes packaged well and very promptly.  Love this item.</li>
    <li> Paris is getting harder to find and I have no sense of smell and ever since I started wearing this I get compliments and I still do.</li>
    <li> Was introduced to Paris a few years ago with a gift from my boss.  It has been my favorite scent ever since. Light, yet stays with me all day.</li>
    <li> This scent has been a favorite ever since it was new.Since that was back in the &#x27;8o&#x27;s ,it is no longer \\&quot;popular\\&quot;, and as a result, not always available for sale. A small inconvenience to pay for wearing a fragrance that almost no one else will be wearing ! The quality of the item is still the same: cut glass bottle (not plastic!),securely sealed, and well-packaged for shipping.</li>
    <li> Best price I have found anywhere.</li>
    <li> This is not a sample or discontinued bottle.  The fragrance was pure.  Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of roses which is why I ordered this gorgeous perfume.  I smelled the fragrance in a department store, liked it, and ordered it on line.</li>
    <li> just what I needed for my wife!</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for about 20 years.  It is a wonderful light fragrance that changes over time.  I spray it on my clothes, too.  It is too wonderful and I will always use it.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed.  It smells like Paris the imposter.  The fragrance has a hard smell to it.  Nor does it last.  I can&#x27;t believe its truly, Paris.  It couldn&#x27;t be.</li>
    <li> This is the only cologne I can use as most give me a terrible headache.  I looked in all the department stores I shop in and they no longer carried it.  I knew I could count on Amazon to have it and I was right.  Came in great packaging, was actually a larger bottle that I used to get and I had it just in time to wear to my daughter&#x27;s wedding.  Love having it again.  Lynnz225</li>
    <li> It is my favorite perfume. I have been using it for the last 22 years.</li>
    <li> Beautiful light and sensual scent.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, wear this daily and love it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  She is completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I started wearing this decades ago. Sexy and classy at the same time. The bottle is a beauty.</li>
    <li> I WAS SO WORRIED THAT THIS WAS BEING DISCONTINUED AS THEY DON&#x27;T CARRY IT ANYMORE AT CARSON PIRIE SCOTT.  I&#x27;M THRILLED AND RELIEVED THAT YOU ARE CARRYING THIS FAVORITE PRODUCT OF MINE.  IT&#x27;S BEEN MY SCENT FOR 20 YEARS!!</li>
    <li> great product and nice time</li>
    <li> Product came swiftly and still a super great price. Loved it!</li>
    <li> Great price&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time</li>
    <li> My order came quickly and I am very happy with it.  The fragrance is as nice as the Paris Perfume my friend picked up for me in Paris!!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think its real!!don&#x27;t smell like the one I get in Macy&#x27;s... Smell&#x27;s okay would have not purchased this had I known. Would have added the few dollars more and get the real Yevs Saint Laurent from Macy&#x27;s!!</li>
    <li> went to Macy&#x27;s and one lady  ask the other what was she wearing, and the other said that she was gonna ask the same , they did not realize it was me wearing Paris next to them.. fabulous</li>
