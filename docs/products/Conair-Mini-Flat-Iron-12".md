      <li>, it works best when it&#x27;s still new..</li>
      <li>Heats quickly and does a great job smoothing.</li>
      <li>Gets nice and hot, but I recommend pluging it in and not using it for a good 20 minutes before you plan on using it.</li>

      <li>Just love them</li>
      <li>Which I&#x27;m glad, because I was running out of options.</li>
      <li>I had to buy 2 more for my daughters so they would leave mine alone</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay-</li>
      <li>But for this price we cannot expect more.</li>

      <li>It heats up quickly and is perfect for short hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to carry for traveling, but I don&#x27;t take it with me anymore</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver.</li>
      <li>Works great for very short hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll be great for travel, and since I don&#x27;t have much hair, I don&#x27;t need much straightener.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel, light weight and small.</li>
      <li>Perfect got the little things !</li>
      <li>It does need to be used with smaller sections because of its size, but I feel that&#x27;s a fair trade off, and it makes it great for styling short hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this purchase.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;d recommend it, even got one for a fellow hair stylist and she loved it for getting the really short hairs around the face.</li>
      <li>I figured a mini flat iron would be good for my Euro trip</li>
      <li>I got it quickly and have used it twice.  </li>
      <li>It heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and gets very hot!  </li>
      <li>What a great little hair iron.</li>
      <li>It works, but honestly I think my larger iron did what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It gets quite hot fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>Fits in my purse without being obvious and I can plug it into my car ac adapter or at work, it heats up in a few quick minutes and is totally perfect for my travel needs as I don&#x27;t use it on all of my hair.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is great for the entire family.</li>
      <li>Also, even though I have small hands, I sometimes grab it too close to the hot plate part and hurt myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, as described, in good packaging</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>Gets pretty hot.</li>
      <li>The hot plate</li>
      <li>Wish it came with a protective case so when hot, I could unplug it, wrap it up and put it away still hot.  </li>
      <li>My husband has extremely short hair, that is rather course and curly,  and he is able to use it as well.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really get hot.  </li>
      <li>My hair is naturally pretty straight</li>
      <li>This is used only for bangs on very curly fine hair.  </li>
      <li>This flat iron is easy to handle and heats up fast.</li>
      <li>It works, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hotter as it is necesesary for straight your hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up so much room.  </li>
      <li>Heats up fast.</li>
      <li>and I use this to curl my hair, and it works really well.</li>
      <li>New, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as the Remington does now, at the end of it&#x27;s life.  </li>
      <li>Hair that was once down to chest is now an inch on the sides and 4/5 inches on the top.</li>
      <li>This product is good ONLY for short hair since for medium or long hair</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair, that in high humidity or in a rush in the mornings I don&#x27;t get to all those &amp;#34;curlys&amp;#34; around my face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;You will find many uses for this tiny flat iron, and I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you really need higher temperatures, buy the bigger version.</li>
      <li>It is definitely hot enough that you can&#x27;t hold the end to stabilize it without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good little flat iron for those with smaller hands.</li>
      <li>This did not get anywhere near hot enough to work on my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super small, even smaller than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing.</li>
      <li>Taking to the office for touch ups if going out directly after work.</li>
      <li>Its small and easy to handle and I don&#x27;t burn my self.</li>
      <li>It is my 1st flat iron, so I don&#x27;t have much to report on.</li>
      <li>The Conair CS86 Mini Ceramic Flat Iron, Navy Blue, 0.5 Inch is exactly what I wanted and what I recieved.  </li>
      <li>Purchased it for a specific reason, my boys have Mohawks and my wife used her normal iron to straighten their hair one day before using gel.  </li>
      <li>The flat iron barely got hot enough to straighten even my mid-cheek-length face-framing layered bangs.</li>
      <li>The heated iron doesn&#x27;t come all the way to the edge, rather there is a bit of plastic surrounding the actual iron to keep you from burning your head, and allowing you to flat iron hair very close to your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think like any flat iron that&#x27;s new</li>
      <li>It also seems to get less hot each time I use it.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even waste my time trying to straighten my whole head of hair (which isn&#x27;t much, although my hair is long).</li>
      <li>takes a little long to heat up, but definitely not bad.</li>
      <li>Something that I never expected has become a big issue...</li>
      <li>The heating element does get very hot, and so does the blue part next to it, but the blue part is not hot enough to have burned my skin for the several times that I have accidentallly made contact for a second.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it won&#x27;t get as hot as it could if you on have it heating for a few minutes.</li>
      <li>A small tuft of hair right on my crown defies gravity every morning.</li>
      <li>I have had this little flat iron for months and when it&#x27;s been plugged in for 20 minutes it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
      <li>I thought this would work a little better, but it makes my hair very stiff.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good size, it works very well. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is really, really tiny. It works perfectly for bangs (which I suppose is what it is intended for) but if you want to use it on any other part of your hair it will take forever to straighten.</li>
    <li> I recently chopped off all my hair. Hair that was once down to chest is now an inch on the sides and 4/5 inches on the top. Something that I never expected has become a big issue...the cowlick. A small tuft of hair right on my crown defies gravity every morning. I got this hoping to tame it, and while it hasn&#x27;t gone through rigorous training yet, I&#x27;ve tried it and it seems to be doing what I needed it for. Which I&#x27;m glad, because I was running out of options. It&#x27;s super small, even smaller than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing. It&#x27;ll be great for travel, and since I don&#x27;t have much hair, I don&#x27;t need much straightener. I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Just love them I have a pixie style</li>
    <li> This is nice and compact. It&#x27;s great for travel.  Heats quickly and does a great job smoothing.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great for the entire family. The best use we have for it is flat-ironing mine and my daughter&#x27;s bangs. My husband has extremely short hair, that is rather course and curly,  and he is able to use it as well.

    <li> Works great, haven&#x27;t had an issue. (Male user)</li>
    <li> The Conair CS86 Mini Ceramic Flat Iron, Navy Blue, 0.5 Inch is exactly what I wanted and what I recieved.  This flat iron is easy to handle and heats up fast.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my gym bag and traveling.  Doesn&#x27;t take up so much room.  Would recommend for anyone in need  of a little straightening!</li>
    <li> Purchased it for a specific reason, my boys have Mohawks and my wife used her normal iron to straighten their hair one day before using gel.  It helped hold up the hair, but the iron was too big for the small amount of hair.  So I found this on Amazon.  It does the job.</li>
    <li> I have seen the mini flat irons at the store but not one this tiny. It seems to work great and fits nicely in my purse. Just really tiny...</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace a Remington Mini.  This is used only for bangs on very curly fine hair.  This did not get anywhere near hot enough to work on my hair.  New, it didn&#x27;t get as hot as the Remington does now, at the end of it&#x27;s life.  I returned it.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty much useless</li>
    <li> This thing is the size of my hand, guess I thought it would be bigger. Perfect size for our backpacking trip. Gets pretty hot.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay- does the job. I&#x27;ve got short short bangs, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to grip them well enough. It also seems to get less hot each time I use it.</li>
    <li> This flatiron is tiny and perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets quite hot fairly quickly. There is no on/off switch, so you do have to remember to unplug it when you are finished using it. It is definitely hot enough that you can&#x27;t hold the end to stabilize it without pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist-length pin-straight hair and I use this to curl my hair, and it works really well. The curls last all day (which they definitely do not with a traditional curling iron).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really, really small, which I like, but can also be a bad thing. The hot plate it is slightly longer than the width of my hand - so sections have to be really small. Also, even though I have small hands, I sometimes grab it too close to the hot plate part and hurt myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, as described, in good packaging</li>
    <li> If all you need to do is bangs ,this is perfect size, compact, cheap.  Couldn&#x27;t find one this size in the stores in my area. Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really get hot.  I just bought it to keep in my purse if I go to a party and my hair gets frizzy in the front.  But it doesn&#x27;t even work for that.  Definitely not good enough if you plan on using it on your whole head.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel and I also use it at home.  I wish it had an &#x27;automatic turn off&#x27; but for the price and size it works great.</li>
    <li> I thought this would work a little better, but it makes my hair very stiff. However, it does straighten my hair and all I have to do it comb it in order to make it less stiff.</li>
    <li> This is defiantly not an every day iron. Heat is ok. Recently used this during my trip to China for 10 days. I travel twice a year for ten to 12 days at a time. I am always looking for ways to reduce cargo weight and get into a smaller suitcase. It works, but honestly I think my larger iron did what I was looking for. I know its small, but it seemed like it took a long time to heat and it did take longer to do my hair. I have chin length hair, so I could image that it would be difficult/very time consuming for if someone had longer hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect got the little things ! I have some new hair coming in and the larger ones don&#x27;t work,  I can get I to the small places</li>
    <li> Its small and easy to handle and I don&#x27;t burn my self.</li>
    <li> needed a flatiron for my bangs and this is perfect. i have gray hair that is curly and this just flattens them out</li>
    <li> works well.  I bought a $30.00 one a left it at the hotel and replaced it with this one.  Not quite as good as that one be definitely a good deal.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> If you really need higher temperatures, buy the bigger version. It&#x27;s easy to carry for traveling, but I don&#x27;t take it with me anymore: it&#x27;s too weak.</li>
    <li> I have had this little flat iron for months and when it&#x27;s been plugged in for 20 minutes it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
    <li> Good quality, and works great. I did expect it a little larger. It is slim, and doesn&#x27;t grab enough hair. I bought this for my bangs and it works great. Heats up fast.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally pretty straight so I usually just use a flat iron to tame the minor fluff. I figured a mini flat iron would be good for my Euro trip so I could save space in my carry-on. The flat iron barely got hot enough to straighten even my mid-cheek-length face-framing layered bangs. I didn&#x27;t even waste my time trying to straighten my whole head of hair (which isn&#x27;t much, although my hair is long). I would only recommend this for people with pixie cuts who need a flat iron that gets close to the scalp.</li>
    <li> No on/off switch. As long as it&#x27;s plugged in, it&#x27;s turned on. And there is no safety shut off so if you forget to unplug it, you could burn your house down.</li>
    <li> Loved it.  I had to buy 2 more for my daughters so they would leave mine alone</li>
    <li> Not sure why I didn&#x27;t think that &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; meant mini, it was tiny, I may have to buy something bigger as it took 5 - 10 swipes just to do my bangs. Otherwise very happy. :)</li>
    <li> What a great little hair iron. It&#x27;s the perfect size for travel, light weight and small. It heats up quickly. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> This small iron works well. It heats up quickly and is perfect for short hair. I would buy the iron again if needed. The price is good too</li>
    <li> Works well. I&#x27;m a guy with short to medium hair so its perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for about a month. This is small so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver. It does need to be used with smaller sections because of its size, but I feel that&#x27;s a fair trade off, and it makes it great for styling short hair. The heating element does get very hot, and so does the blue part next to it, but the blue part is not hot enough to have burned my skin for the several times that I have accidentallly made contact for a second. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I loved this! I think like any flat iron that&#x27;s new, it works best when it&#x27;s still new.. but right now it still gets the job done! :D</li>
    <li> Works great for very short hair.</li>
    <li> For this price do not expect to receive an amazyn item. It works, but it doesn&#x27;t get as hotter as it is necesesary for straight your hair. If you use it be careful since you can burn your fingers, since it is a little difficul to use. This product is good ONLY for short hair since for medium or long hair you will spend hours in your head. But for this price we cannot expect more.</li>
    <li> I got it quickly and have used it twice.  It is my 1st flat iron, so I don&#x27;t have much to report on.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> This is my second one in 7 years.  I have wavy hair, that in high humidity or in a rush in the mornings I don&#x27;t get to all those &amp;#34;curlys&amp;#34; around my face.  Fits in my purse without being obvious and I can plug it into my car ac adapter or at work, it heats up in a few quick minutes and is totally perfect for my travel needs as I don&#x27;t use it on all of my hair.  Wish it came with a protective case so when hot, I could unplug it, wrap it up and put it away still hot.  Still five stars though.</li>
    <li> takes a little long to heat up, but definitely not bad.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my bangs. It was exactly what I was looking for and gets very hot!  Works great! Doesn&#x27;t have different settings though.</li>
    <li> Good little flat iron for those with smaller hands. Gets nice and hot, but I recommend pluging it in and not using it for a good 20 minutes before you plan on using it. I&#x27;ve noticed it won&#x27;t get as hot as it could if you on have it heating for a few minutes. But I&#x27;d recommend it, even got one for a fellow hair stylist and she loved it for getting the really short hairs around the face.</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I expected. Taking to the office for touch ups if going out directly after work.</li>
    <li> Great product.....works great</li>
    <li> Ineffective...almost defective.</li>
</ol>
