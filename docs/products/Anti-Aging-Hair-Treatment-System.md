<li> One of the few shampoos I can use without breaking out in a rash.</li>
<li> but I&#x27;ve notice that it&#x27;s just a few strands in the bath tub now .</li>
<li> I had very limp, thin and unhealthy hair and after using these products for two weeks, my hair is much healthier and manageable.</li>
<li> They are clumsy to use, and it is nearly impossible to use #2.,,the leave in #3 will never last through the system....</li>
<li> A sorry mess all around and loss of money.  </li>
<li> Expensive but works well.</li>
<li> (sorry, guys)</li>
<li> As with the other reviewers, I HATE the bottles!!  </li>
<li> It was an awful mess.  </li>

    <li> This arrived  covered with sticky tape.  Took me ten minutes to unwrap.  After that the outside of each of the three was also sticky from that see- through tape. It was an awful mess.  It also felt as if it had been used already.  I threw them all in the bin.  I will get another group from Walmart should I ever want to try these again.  A sorry mess all around and loss of money.  Brittanica</li>

    <li> Excellent  product ! Best results using a very small amount. Prior to use, my hair was falling out at an alarming rate. My hair is much healthier  with increased volume &amp; shine.  My salon color lasts longer also. I  have recommended this product to my daughter.</li>
