      <li>I am very pleased to have purchased this item.</li>
      <li>Absolutely my favorite toothpaste ever!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to mint and found this toothpaste as a nice alternative.  </li>
      <li>What was really effective was Dr. Collins&#x27; novamin toothpaste, which has been discontinued.</li>
      <li>Nice flavor.</li>
      <li>Loved how it made my mouth feel clean</li>
      <li>Great tooth paste, fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I will continue to buy it, for sure.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m buying a two pack -- one for me, and one for my parents because I think they&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
      <li>My wife uses the product, she seems pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Better than others I have used</li>
      <li>Recently, I started using a remineralizing UK toothpaste which is perfect.</li>
      <li>(flourine is more reactive than iodine  - look at the periodic table).  </li>
      <li>What more can I say?</li>
      <li>Safe and OK to swallow.</li>
      <li>I found Squigle and am pleased it lives up to reviews.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste….</li>
      <li>It may take some time for you to heal, but Squigle will help, and will keep your mouth and skin healthy going forward.</li>
      <li>I think I will focus more on that tooth as time goes</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m just glad I found it</li>
      <li>I am 100% pleased with their toothpaste as it causes me NO pain, while cleaning my teeth and mouth</li>
      <li>Their shipping is very reasonable and their product description is good.</li>
      <li>Great for those with sensitive gums, teeth, canker sores, etc.!</li>
      <li>Tastes good and cleans my teeth very well also.</li>
      <li>I love this product it really helps the sensitiveness on my teeth!!!</li>
      <li>I switched from Sensodyne which has been very effective for my sensitive teeth,  to Squiggle because I didn&#x27;t want fluoride in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>But fine as is.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d had a cavity filled the week before which</li>
      <li>need to look to see if a rinse, in addition to this toothpaste, is available and wouldn&#x27;t negate the brushing.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s important that you know your underlying issue before you attach any expectations to the efficacy of this product.</li>
      <li>but since it is free of fluoride and free of SLS then it is something that I like.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and have been trying to find a good non fluoridated toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Brushing daily with Squigle is even better!!</li>
      <li>Not sure if it &amp;#34;builds&amp;#34; teeth but it is very good for sensitive teeth and has a great taste.</li>
      <li>Product leaves very fresh feeling to teeth.  </li>
      <li>Mine feel smooth, I also chew xylitol sweetened gum and take xylitol mints to generate saliva which contribute to the all-day clean</li>
      <li>Simply put this very mild flavored tooth paste combined with a good xylitol mouthwash will keep your mouth very fresh</li>
      <li>Great for keeping the  teeth  healthy without harsh ingredients  that can irritate gums.</li>
      <li>I also disagree with reviewers whose teeth do not feel clean.</li>
      <li>This fit the bill and my mouth is very thankful!!</li>
      <li>This one is nice and has done the trick with my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>taste is sweet, but not bad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have been using this for a while and was using a popular brand name toothepaste for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>He even suggested at one point that I just buy a full size tube (of a product I already know I don&#x27;t want because it doesn&#x27;t have the oral care ingredients I&#x27;m looking for), use it (which could result in hospitalization or death), then give it to a friend if it does not work for me (wasting my money which I stated.up front</li>
      <li>but it is true.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it for 6+ months, reordered twice and had a good checkup last week.  </li>
      <li>The first time I brush with this toothpaste I felt like my teeth were moisturized!</li>
      <li>It is sensitive and does not cause mouth sores and irritation as many of these &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; toothpastes do.</li>
      <li>I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the ingredients list more closely, but it might make sense for them to clearly label it as non-flouride, since that&#x27;s kind of standard.</li>
      <li>Squiggle has proven to be equally effective for my teeth and as an extra bonus, I no longer gag when brushing my teeth.  </li>
      <li>Because of previous issues we are trying to avoid excess fluoride exposure; if you want a no-fluoride, xylitol-based paste this is a good one.</li>
      <li>pleasant enough to use, but it didn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Highly pleased I will only buy this brand.  </li>
      <li>Within the first two days I noticed that an area on my front tooth which had started to become translucent was shrinking.</li>
      <li>I personally would like to have a bit more flavor.</li>
      <li>This is the only toothpaste I have been able to use after my throat cancer.</li>
      <li>I have always had very sensitive teeth, but when I developed an autoimmune disease that made my entire mouth more sensitive than I can begin to describe, I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do to keep my teeth clean and healthy.</li>
      <li>Any other kind of toothpaste really irritates my gums, and Squigle doesn&#x27;t whatsoever!  </li>
      <li>can only conclude that his company is more interested in moving a particular product than having any concern about their customer&#x27;s health.</li>
      <li>I carefully searched for toothpaste, seeking a decent value and good for my sensitive gums after bleaching treatments.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I did not expect this toothpaste to work so quickly, nor did I expect it to work better than Sensodyne,and other sensitive teeth toothpastes I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
      <li>but I would think it would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, it really works.  </li>
      <li>Yes it really works, and yes I really need it.   </li>
      <li>Very grateful</li>
      <li>It has really helped.</li>
      <li>It does very well what it is supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Squiggle is gentle on the insides of my mouth and doesn&#x27;t burn the ulcers.  </li>
      <li>Seems as if brushing morning and evening is sufficient, but it really makes a difference if I can get an afternoon brushing in as well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>I originally purchased this because I&#x27;m prone to canker sores, especially when stressed-out.</li>
      <li>After trying every chapstick available, I finally stumbled across an article talking about irritants in normal toothpaste and decided to try Squigle since it doesn&#x27;t contain those irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Wow, this really works for me!  </li>
      <li>Works better than any other sensitive toothpaste I&#x27;ve used and no fluoride!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the taste, so I mix it with a bit of Sensodyne.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>It is for sensitive teeth and works very well.  </li>
      <li>No flavor and the xylitol keeps your teeth fat cleaner than normal toothpastes.</li>
      <li>Kids love the taste and our teeth are stronger and less sensitive.</li>
      <li>They felt protected but not like there was a film, but a new strength coating them.</li>
      <li>I really wanted a fluoride free toothpaste, but I held out little hope that one would really help as much as the bigger brands.</li>
      <li>My teeth are very sensitive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth. The first time I brush with this toothpaste I felt like my teeth were moisturized! They felt protected but not like there was a film, but a new strength coating them. It is expensive, but worth it.  On my recommendation/testimony my dentist is now telling all his patients with sensitive teeth to use this toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I switched from Sensodyne which has been very effective for my sensitive teeth,  to Squiggle because I didn&#x27;t want fluoride in my mouth.  Squiggle has proven to be equally effective for my teeth and as an extra bonus, I no longer gag when brushing my teeth.  Nice flavor.</li>
    <li> Great for keeping the  teeth  healthy without harsh ingredients  that can irritate gums.</li>
    <li> Since starting my Invisalign treatment, I have been brushing my teeth up to 6 times daily (every single time you eat or drink anything but water), and noticed my lips were always chapped and peeling. After trying every chapstick available, I finally stumbled across an article talking about irritants in normal toothpaste and decided to try Squigle since it doesn&#x27;t contain those irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week later: no more chapped lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda miss the mint flavor of regular toothpaste, but you get used to it, and mint was possibly one of the things irritating my skin.</li>
    <li> Hard to believe that there is no SLS in this product but it is true. Creates a lot of foaminess but since it is free of fluoride and free of SLS then it is something that I like. I believe it works to seal exposed dentin and reduce tooth sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the taste and sometimes it even made me gag. Not great for tooth sensitivity, either. Although I used it for several weeks, everyday, it never made anything better. Will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;I have used sensodyne in the past and found it ineffective. What was really effective was Dr. Collins&#x27; novamin toothpaste, which has been discontinued. Recently, I started using a remineralizing UK toothpaste which is perfect.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m allergic to mint and found this toothpaste as a nice alternative.  It is just about the best toothpaste ever.</li>
    <li> As a result of dry mouth I have suffered with rapid tooth decay over the past 4 years. I received this product 1 day before it was promised and immediately brushed my teeth upon receipt. I found the taste pleasant, and nondescript. I like that I don&#x27;t have to wait for a minty flavor to disappear before eating. I&#x27;ve never liked the minty taste of most toothpastes. By the time I finish brushing I have no distinct taste in my mouth. Some reviewers have mentioned that this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t foam as much as regular toothpaste - I disagree. To me it foams as much as regular toothpaste. Maybe it&#x27;s the amount used -- I cover my toothbrush&#x27;s bristles in a single line from one end to the other, perhaps they don&#x27;t. I also disagree with reviewers whose teeth do not feel clean. Mine feel smooth, I also chew xylitol sweetened gum and take xylitol mints to generate saliva which contribute to the all-day clean feel I&#x27;ve experienced.&lt;br /&gt;When I began using this paste I&#x27;d had a cavity filled the week before which was pressure and temperature sensitive. I&#x27;d also had another filling retouched on the same day. It was also pressure and temperature sensitive. I have dealt with temperature sensitivity for at least the past 10 years. Nothing seemed to work on a long-term basis. While my sensitivity was mild in comparison to some of the other reviewers the idea of chewing ice or digging into icecream teeth first was scary. Within the first two days I noticed that an area on my front tooth which had started to become translucent was shrinking. Also the temperature sensitivity in my front teeth was drastically reduced. My fillings were still sensitive to temperature and pressure but it was easier to chew crunchy things slowly. Today, not quite a week later the pressure and heat sensitivity in one of my recent fillings is completely gone. The tooth which still feels slightly temperature sensitive is all the way in the back of my mouth its filling was retouched 12 days ago. I am assuming thatit has had less exposure to my brushing over the past week than the other teeth. I think I will focus more on that tooth as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did not expect this toothpaste to work so quickly, nor did I expect it to work better than Sensodyne,and other sensitive teeth toothpastes I&#x27;ve used over the years. I did a lot of research on my dental issues before I purchased this toothpaste. As a result, I purchased this toothpaste with the intent of remineralizing my teeth (it is one component of an overall strategy). Six days in I can only say I am astonished at my results. Furthermore, while I believe this is a great product, I do not believe that using just this toothpaste  (or any toothpaste) alone will effectively stop tooth sensitivity. Sensitivity is a symptom of an underlying issue and I think it&#x27;s important that you know your underlying issue before you attach any expectations to the efficacy of this product.</li>
    <li> I emailed the company to find out if it used GMO ingredients and this is the response I received: &amp;#34;Squigle&#x27;s Xylitol is made in the USA from beech and birch trees. It is gmo-free.  Our competitors use Chinese xylitol.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative toothpaste when my lichen planus acts up.  Finally found it.  Squiggle is gentle on the insides of my mouth and doesn&#x27;t burn the ulcers.  Anybody with this condition should try it.  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t make your mouth feel particularly fresh due to the lack of mint -- but, it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> Kids love the taste and our teeth are stronger and less sensitive.</li>
    <li> got rid of my sensitivity. also used the colgate prescription product so not sure if this or the other or in conjunction worked together to heal.</li>
    <li> Highly pleased I will only buy this brand.  If compared.. no real contest . A great  for giving any time !</li>
    <li> A non-fluoride way to take care of my sensitive teeth!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased to have purchased this item. It does very well what it is supposed to do. I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I carefully searched for toothpaste, seeking a decent value and good for my sensitive gums after bleaching treatments. I found Squigle and am pleased it lives up to reviews. I personally would like to have a bit more flavor. But fine as is. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Finding Squigle Tooth Builder Sensitive Toothpaste was the FIND of the decade, for me.  I have always had very sensitive teeth, but when I developed an autoimmune disease that made my entire mouth more sensitive than I can begin to describe, I didn&#x27;t know what I was going to do to keep my teeth clean and healthy. I tried every toothpaste described as &amp;#34; mild ,&amp;#34; with absolutely no success. After exhausting my grocery store choices, I turned to Amazon and after a few poor choices from other companies, I found Squigle !  I am 100% pleased with their toothpaste as it causes me NO pain, while cleaning my teeth and mouth exceptionly well.  I just received my second order and shall be using this toothpaste for the foreseeable future.</li>
    <li> My wife uses the product, she seems pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This should be placed in every grocery store across America!!  My teeth were sensitive to hot/cold....not anymore.  I keep Xylitol crystal packets in a draw at work, and eat one - two packets, let it dissolve in my mouth...sensitivity is gone. Brushing daily with Squigle is even better!!</li>
    <li> I brux and have some worn areas on my teeth, I&#x27;m also highly sensitive.  This toothpaste, with no chemicals, has refilled my enamel on those teeth and I&#x27;m no longer wincing with pain when I eat hot or cold foods.  Can&#x27;t recommend the ingredients and the results high enough.  However, the price on this 2 pack used to be around $20 and now it&#x27;s $35.  That&#x27;s absurd for a product that costs $9.60 for a single.  Someone&#x27;s made a mistake.  Buy the toothpaste, but not this 2-pack bad deal. [UPDATE: no longer relevant, price has come down for single and double order, and is now the same as a lot of natural toothpastes so it&#x27;s affordable for its niche.  THANK YOU!!!!!]  UPDATE 12/6/2016: Two-pack price I switched to another toothpaste just to save money, Earthpaste by Redmond&#x27;s, a company I trust.  Loved how it made my mouth feel clean but... my teeth sensitivity came back.  So I am back using the Squigle and once again the sensitivity is receding. Guess I&#x27;ve tested the proposition: Yes it really works, and yes I really need it.   p.s. My dentist initially prescribed a different  brand, a chemical brand, with similar properties as Squigle but all kinds of chemicals and fluoride, which I will not use. Very grateful I found this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I wish this toothpaste was in local markets!! It&#x27;s truly the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve found that is not fluorinated and has a great yet mild minty taste. I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s and Jason brand non-flouride toothpastes, but they simply don&#x27;t compare. I&#x27;m buying a two pack -- one for me, and one for my parents because I think they&#x27;ll love it, too.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste I have been able to use after my throat cancer. I had a hard time finding one that didn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
    <li> FINALLY found a toothpaste that works.</li>
    <li> This has been very helpful for us with some kids with serious cavities. Because of previous issues we are trying to avoid excess fluoride exposure; if you want a no-fluoride, xylitol-based paste this is a good one.</li>
    <li> My teeth almost never hurt since I started using this toothpaste. I previously had tooth pain with hot or cold food or beverage, every time. Now, I only feel a slight pain if I eat shave ice. It works!</li>
    <li> I hate flavored toothpaste. This stuff is amazing. No flavor and the xylitol keeps your teeth fat cleaner than normal toothpastes. I found this by accident on Amazon, gave it a try and not looking back.</li>
    <li> Product leaves very fresh feeling to teeth.  It is sensitive and does not cause mouth sores and irritation as many of these &amp;#34;powerful&amp;#34; toothpastes do.</li>
    <li> Squigle was recommended by my dentist.  Forget the other &#x27;sensitive&#x27; toothpaste on the drug store shelves.  This is the only one that truly delivers.  My mouth sores have stopped, my gums and tounge does not burn when I brush.  I&#x27;ve used it for 6+ months, reordered twice and had a good checkup last week.  Buy it; i works!</li>
    <li> I have Lichen Planus and when it flairs up, I use this instead of regular toothpaste.  All the additives of regular toothpaste just make the mouth problem worse and this helps calm the tissue.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and have been trying to find a good non fluoridated toothpaste.  This one is nice and has done the trick with my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This actually works! My teeth are very sensitive. I really wanted a fluoride free toothpaste, but I held out little hope that one would really help as much as the bigger brands. I have been using Tooth Builder for a year now, and it keeps my teeth from becoming sensitive to cold and to my hygienist&#x27;s cleanings. I will continue to buy it, for sure.</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims to do. This is my third day using it and my teeth hurt a lot less. I will continue using it</li>
    <li> I had an irritated mouth that no doctor or dentist could diagnose. Knowing fluoride sometimes gave me problems, I gave this toothpaste a try. It has really helped.</li>
    <li> I love this product it really helps the sensitiveness on my teeth!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 67.  Tried a lot of toothpastes.  Teeth and gums changed through the years.  This toothpaste has it all.  Lots of Xylitol, no fluoride, only toothpaste that lessens my teeth pain,  good for gums, no funny needless chemicals.  I have to buy it online but I&#x27;m just glad I found it</li>
    <li> Better than others I have used</li>
    <li> Seems to be remineralizing my son&#x27;s baby teeth!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it doesn&#x27;t have flouride.  I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the ingredients list more closely, but it might make sense for them to clearly label it as non-flouride, since that&#x27;s kind of standard.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothpaste. Not sure if it &amp;#34;builds&amp;#34; teeth but it is very good for sensitive teeth and has a great taste.</li>
    <li> I have an OVERLY sensitive mouth and my dentist recommended getting a toothpaste with no fluoride and no flavoring.  This fit the bill and my mouth is very thankful!!</li>
    <li> Safe and OK to swallow. No flouride or bad chemicals. Works good on teeth. Can call guy who makes this to ask questions.His phone number is on package.</li>
    <li> Great tooth paste, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have oral lichen planus.  I was on a blog with people who had oral lichen planus and they raved about this product.  I highly recommend it.  It works great for me.  No more burning and my teeth are whiter than they have ever been.  I buy it on amazon in packages of 2.  Great price...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t support the Squigle company. They don&#x27;t give a bleep about your health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got off the phone with the Squigle company rep ( [...]&lt;br /&gt;I asked about the possibility of a sample of Enamel Saver toothpaste because peppermint flavoring has caused sensitivity in the past. I explained that I don&#x27;&#x27;t have money to waste on a product that may turn out to be useless.to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gentleman&#x27;s response was to hard-sell me on their other \\&quot;tooth builder\\&quot; paste. I explained OVER FOUR TIMES that I had no interest in that formulation, in part because I am severely allergic to one of the ingredients to the level of hospitalization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He kept arguing with me that I shouldn&#x27;t be allergic (because, according.to him, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m actually.allergic to - talk about insulting!) and I should try that product any way. He even suggested at one point that I just buy a full size tube (of a product I already know I don&#x27;t want because it doesn&#x27;t have the oral care ingredients I&#x27;m looking for), use it (which could result in hospitalization or death), then give it to a friend if it does not work for me (wasting my money which I stated.up front I was trying to.avoid). This guy clearly was not the least bit interested in my needs or concerns as a customer. In fact, he was quite willing to kill me in order to sell a single tube of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only conclude that his company is more interested in moving a particular product than having any concern about their customer&#x27;s health. Please don&#x27;t encourage or support them via your spending habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this conversation, I wouldn&#x27;t use this company&#x27;s products if they were given to me for free. :(</li>
    <li> I was using Theradent rinse until it stopped being made. Did a great job minimizing sensitivity. Bought this after reading reviews and am almost as happy as I was with the Theradent. Seems as if brushing morning and evening is sufficient, but it really makes a difference if I can get an afternoon brushing in as well.&lt;br /&gt;The taste is sweet, but not bad.&lt;br /&gt;I need to look to see if a rinse, in addition to this toothpaste, is available and wouldn&#x27;t negate the brushing.</li>
    <li> Simply put this very mild flavored tooth paste combined with a good xylitol mouthwash will keep your mouth very fresh and you get perfect check ups from the dentist. (Unless you have one that always finds a &amp;#34;soft spot&amp;#34; that mysteriously moves from check up to check up!) I can&#x27;t speak to the sensitivity issue but I would think it would be very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say however that the prices here on Amazon have become ridiculous. I Googled &amp;#34;Squigle&amp;#34; and came up with Homestead Market. Their shipping is very reasonable and their product description is good. They offer other xylitol products and tell you which ones came from China. This one does not. So far. I also prefer birch xylitol as it has no GMO&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why it works, but it reduces my tooth sensitivity just like the pastes that use &amp;#34;chemicals&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t pronounce.  Tastes good and cleans my teeth very well also.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste….</li>
    <li> Yes, it really works.  I have been using this for a while and was using a popular brand name toothepaste for sensitive teeth.  I decided that I no longer wanted to have any fluoride in my mouth (flourine is more reactive than iodine  - look at the periodic table).  Needless to say my last visit to the dentist was better, too.</li>
    <li> Absolutely my favorite toothpaste ever! Works better than any other sensitive toothpaste I&#x27;ve used and no fluoride!</li>
    <li> Wow, this really works for me!  I have suffered for years with canker sores that take two weeks to heal, and this toothpaste shortens the healing time and the pain to a few days.  I would develop a canker sore anytime I scratched my gums with potato or corn chips, when I bit my cheek, or when I was under stress.  I saw this advertised online and decided to try it.  A few days after receiving it and starting to use it, I bit my cheek again...broke the skin and drew blood.  I thought, &amp;#34;Well, this will be a good test for Tooth Builder.&amp;#34;  I was amazed that the sore was completely gone in just four days, with less pain while healing.  I now use it daily to prevent any sores, and have not had an episode in months. I hope Squigle makes this forever...it works.</li>
    <li> If you are allergic to sodium lauryl sulfate, this is the toothpaste for you. I developed severe sensitivity to SLS several years ago. It took me a long time to figure out what was causing blisters inside my mouth and peeling skin on my lips and face. Two dentists and an oral surgeon had no idea. I looked online to see what others with the same symptoms were going through and figured it out myself. Both of the Squigle toothpastes are excellent and cause no irritation. It may take some time for you to heal, but Squigle will help, and will keep your mouth and skin healthy going forward.</li>
    <li> So happy I found this toothpaste.  Any other kind of toothpaste really irritates my gums, and Squigle doesn&#x27;t whatsoever!  It is for sensitive teeth and works very well.  Seems a little pricey compared to other toothpaste, but worth the money because now I can brush without any discomfort.</li>
    <li> pleasant enough to use, but it didn&#x27;t seem to have much effect on sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the only paste I use for my teeth. It is excellent and it prevents cavities. I also chew a xylitol gum once a day in the evening.</li>
    <li> Used this toothpaste for the past 2 years.  No more sensitive teeth - no more mouth sores.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing Squigle&#x27;s &#x27;Tooth Builder.&#x27; I originally purchased this because I&#x27;m prone to canker sores, especially when stressed-out. I haven&#x27;t had a canker sore since using this toothpaste! I don&#x27;t particularly care for the taste, so I mix it with a bit of Sensodyne. Great for those with sensitive gums, teeth, canker sores, etc.!</li>
