### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Wonderfully.</li>
      <li>This is the best vitamin C serum I have ever used</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for under eye circles.</li>
      <li>If you have never tried any of her products, this is a great start.</li>
      <li>This Resist C15 Super Booster is the best skin care product I have EVER used!</li>
      <li>remember that after three months the vitamin c is no longer effective.</li>
      <li>Nice product .</li>
      <li>but it has a strong plastic odor that is making me avoid using it!</li>
      <li>Its ok.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff..</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Great product, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>and the ok results I achieved, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product for myself.  </li>
      <li>I love putting it on before bed and waking up with my skin glowing.</li>
      <li>brighter more radiant skin.</li>
      <li>Skin is clearer and more even</li>
      <li>I have used Paulas Choice for many many years,  this product was out of stock stock at Paulas Choice.com</li>
      <li>[...] enjoy!</li>
      <li>I was so excited to be picked to try this product!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product thus far.  </li>
      <li>I cannot speak to the quality of this product for individuals NOT allergic to any ingredients, but I have found other Paula &#x27; s Choice products to be excellent.</li>
      <li>Super Quality and a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; price!  </li>
      <li>This little gem is designed to boost the effectiveness and speed of any of Paula&#x27;s excellent serums, exfoliants, moisturizers, treatments--you name it (except sunscreens; you don&#x27;t want to dilute those).&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>So far good results .</li>
      <li>I received a sample of this in the mail and liked it so much I purchased a full size bottle.  </li>
      <li>I am now using the entire Paula&#x27;s Choice range and it&#x27;s fantastic - great quality in terms of ingredients and really effective products at really affordable prices, it mixes really well with the super antioxidant serum</li>
      <li>truth be told i dont actually need to be this bright.</li>
      <li>you purchase a full size product of Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
      <li>I really had wished it worked better than it did.  </li>
      <li>, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream.</li>
      <li>so of course I was willing to try the serum!  </li>
      <li>She puts her own products thru the same rigorous procedures; something almost--if not all--other skin care companies don&#x27;t</li>
      <li>I got a sample and so far I love it.</li>
      <li>Only time will tell if it is effective.  </li>
      <li>Just to be certain I was not imagining the great improvements to my skin, I stopped using it for a while and saw my skin reverting to its wrinklier, less glowy self.</li>
      <li>a consumer, I love how involved they are with the community, that they offer a 100% money back guarantee and that they do no animal</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and love the way it makes my face feel.  </li>
      <li>This seems to do a good job of moisturizing, although its heavy and sticky.</li>
      <li>if my husband and i didnt use this together, id buy the deluxe sample size for myself, or id buy another glass dark bottle</li>
      <li>Honestly, it took less than 9 days and they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>Really like this product.</li>
      <li>Meh, didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
      <li>Some don&#x27;t like the glass bottle packaging, but I find it very convenient</li>
      <li>I have no idea if that is the way it is supposed to work (pretty much free floating), but it makes screwing the top back on to the bottle more difficult.  </li>
      <li>When I buy at PC&#x27;s website, I always buy enough to qualify for free shipping, so that plus the frequent sales keeps me purchasing there.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is sticky in texture and isn&#x27;t my favorite to apply, so I usually add it to moisturizer.</li>
      <li>(light diminished the effectiveness of the vit c) and store half</li>
      <li>The clear plastic &amp;#34;stopper&amp;#34; that is supposed to help prevent oxidation is not attached to either the dropper mechanism or the bottle.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;As far as a product review</li>
      <li>its frequently on sale.</li>
      <li>the whole bottle only lasted me a month.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>I mean who doesn&#x27;t want better looking skin, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Vit C/E/Ferulic acid (plus a few other ingredients) is far more effective than any other versions, all typically costing well over $100.</li>
      <li>They usually have free shipping, too.</li>
      <li>If I am starting to run out of this product it makes me nervous, I have used other much more expensive versions like Skinceuticals CE Ferulic in the past but this product is superior.</li>
      <li>I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
      <li>And it does nothing for dark circles under your eyes, I&#x27;ve used it two weeks straight.</li>
      <li>the foil &#x27;freshness&#x27; seal on the bottle wasn&#x27;t exactly sealed and about 1/5 of the bottle was wasted from the start.</li>
      <li>If the same apparently faulty assembly exists with the yet unopened bottle, it will be the last bottle I purchase.  </li>

<li> Paula&#x27;s products are based on substantial medical research, including properly conducted independent double blind testing, peer reviewed results, and published results in true medical journals, all of which are listed on her web site.</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to know if it is making a difference</li>
<li> It has a strange smell, and my husband calls me &amp;#34;bacon face&amp;#34; when I put it on.</li>
<li> I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved.</li>
<li> for background, a little about me: I am not affiliated with Paula&#x27;s Choice in any way, I generally like her skin care and dislike her makeup.</li>
<li> My skin is dry, dry, dry!</li>
<li> Looks like I&#x27;m in it for the long haul, so I am careful to buy when it&#x27;s on sale on the PC website.</li>
<li> do.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I added this serum to my daily routine and was shocked at how fast some old red marks and two age spots vanished!</li>
<li> Paula makes no claims that can&#x27;t be substantiated and while vitamin C is expensive, her&#x27;s is about as reasonable as it gets for something of such quality and potency!</li>
<li> didn&#x27;t notice any difference as compared to any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> I want that spot and some other brown spots gone</li>
<li> But the price here isn&#x27;t bad either given that it includes free shipping.</li>
<li> I found the packaging to be less than I would expect from a Paula&#x27;s Choice product.  </li>
<li> It faded the spot a little and did brighten up my skin a bit, however, not the way I had</li>
<li> It smoothed out wrinkles in my forehead that were there after using sporadically for a few weeks.</li>
<li> Lid did not fit</li>
<li> hes been looking tired with dull skin lately and this gives him an instant pick me up.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any difference, but I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
<li> Regardless, if all ingredients were listed on Amazon&#x27;s site, I could (possibly) have prevented my painful skin mess and the trouble of returning his product.</li>
<li> if i stop using it will my skin keep its brightness or get dull again soon?</li>
<li> Sorry to say that, but the quality of the container is not what I expected from Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
<li> did I really spend $48 for this crap?</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m addicted...</li>
<li> She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse.</li>
<li> The screw cap and dropper are broken.</li>
<li> I used the expensive skincueticals and tried to downgrade to this, but noticed no improvement.</li>
<li> Disappointed that Amazon does not require sellers to show ALL product ingredients.</li>
<li> Something in this product made my skin break out/rash terribly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its ok.  It does smell like bacon so be prepared.</li>
    <li> This is the best vitamin C serum I have ever used and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different kinds. I love putting it on before bed and waking up with my skin glowing. It&#x27;s great for under eye circles. You can get it cheaper through the Paula&#x27;s Choice website, though. Use this link for $10 off - https://goo.gl/OaekuX and check online for additional 20% off codes. They usually have free shipping, too.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to know if it is making a difference but it has a strong plastic odor that is making me avoid using it! Ugh!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product thus far.  Only time will tell if it is effective.  I found the packaging to be less than I would expect from a Paula&#x27;s Choice product.  The clear plastic &amp;#34;stopper&amp;#34; that is supposed to help prevent oxidation is not attached to either the dropper mechanism or the bottle.  I have no idea if that is the way it is supposed to work (pretty much free floating), but it makes screwing the top back on to the bottle more difficult.  I had ordered a second bottle which hasn&#x27;t been opened yet.  If the same apparently faulty assembly exists with the yet unopened bottle, it will be the last bottle I purchase.  Sorry to say that, but the quality of the container is not what I expected from Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
    <li> The screw cap and dropper are broken. The bottle leaks everywhere.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Skin is clearer and more even</li>
    <li> If I am starting to run out of this product it makes me nervous, I have used other much more expensive versions like Skinceuticals CE Ferulic in the past but this product is superior. I am now using the entire Paula&#x27;s Choice range and it&#x27;s fantastic - great quality in terms of ingredients and really effective products at really affordable prices, it mixes really well with the super antioxidant serum and I feel that when I&#x27;m using both that I can face the morning with confidence!</li>
    <li> the foil &#x27;freshness&#x27; seal on the bottle wasn&#x27;t exactly sealed and about 1/5 of the bottle was wasted from the start. the whole bottle only lasted me a month. did I really spend $48 for this crap? (price at time of writing this review) total ripoff. didn&#x27;t notice any difference as compared to any other product I&#x27;ve used. avoid</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s making any difference, but I&#x27;ve been using it. It is sticky in texture and isn&#x27;t my favorite to apply, so I usually add it to moisturizer. It has a strange smell, and my husband calls me &amp;#34;bacon face&amp;#34; when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Reduces wrinkles. Adds a definite glow. Gives skin a youthful vibrancy. Yes, really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for background, a little about me: I am not affiliated with Paula&#x27;s Choice in any way, I generally like her skin care and dislike her makeup. My skin is dry, dry, dry! I am mid-60s with wrinkles, some sun damage, no blemishes. This Resist C15 Super Booster is the best skin care product I have EVER used! Bar none. I saw immediate results. Just to be certain I was not imagining the great improvements to my skin, I stopped using it for a while and saw my skin reverting to its wrinklier, less glowy self. Believe me, I returned to using it morning and night. Looks like I&#x27;m in it for the long haul, so I am careful to buy when it&#x27;s on sale on the PC website. But the price here isn&#x27;t bad either given that it includes free shipping. When I buy at PC&#x27;s website, I always buy enough to qualify for free shipping, so that plus the frequent sales keeps me purchasing there. I highly recommend this product. Some don&#x27;t like the glass bottle packaging, but I find it very convenient and I know it preserves the fragile vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients as listed on the PC website:&lt;br /&gt;Key Ingredients: ferulic acid, acetyl octapeptide-3, glycerin, panthenol, tocopherol, sodium hyaluronate, ascorbic acid&lt;br /&gt;Product Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C/antioxidant), Ethoxydiglycol (slip agent/penetration enhancer), PPG-26 Buteth-26 (emulsifier), PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil (thickener), Tocopherol (vitamin E/antioxidant), Ferulic Acid (antioxidant), Sodium Hyaluronate (skin-repairing ingredient), Acetyl Octapeptide-3 (cell-communicating ingredient), Glycerin (skin-repairing ingredient), Panthenol (skin conditioning agent), Sodium Metabisulfite (stabilizer/antioxidant), Triethanolamine (pH adjuster), Phenoxyethanol (preservative).</li>
    <li> This little gem is designed to boost the effectiveness and speed of any of Paula&#x27;s excellent serums, exfoliants, moisturizers, treatments--you name it (except sunscreens; you don&#x27;t want to dilute those).&lt;br /&gt;And it does! If you have never tried any of her products, this is a great start. It even comes in sample size, and like all her items it is backed by her terrific customer service and return policy.&lt;br /&gt;All Paula&#x27;s products are based on substantial medical research, including properly conducted independent double blind testing, peer reviewed results, and published results in true medical journals, all of which are listed on her web site. She puts her own products thru the same rigorous procedures; something almost--if not all--other skin care companies don&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I added this serum to my daily routine and was shocked at how fast some old red marks and two age spots vanished! Honestly, it took less than 9 days and they were gone.&lt;br /&gt;This Vit C/E/Ferulic acid (plus a few other ingredients) is far more effective than any other versions, all typically costing well over $100. Her price is just $40.00 US dollars. And it works. Wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Nice product . So far good results .</li>
    <li> Disappointed that Amazon does not require sellers to show ALL product ingredients. Something in this product made my skin break out/rash terribly. Perhaps this product contains salycic acid or hyaluronic acid??? (both to which I&#x27;m allergic). Or perhaps I&#x27;m unknowingly  allergic to ferulic acid (which was listed). Regardless, if all ingredients were listed on Amazon&#x27;s site, I could (possibly) have prevented my painful skin mess and the trouble of returning his product. PLEASE DO NOT OMIT ANY INGREDIENTS ON FACIAL SKIN PRODUCTS ADVERTISED ON AMAZON!!! I cannot speak to the quality of this product for individuals NOT allergic to any ingredients, but I have found other Paula &#x27; s Choice products to be excellent.</li>
    <li> all her products deliver</li>
    <li> YEA!!  you have Paulas Choice products!  I have used Paulas Choice for many many years,  this product was out of stock stock at Paulas Choice.com&lt;br /&gt;Norge Star saved my face.  I now know where to get Paula&#x27;s Choice products&lt;br /&gt;My Face and I Thank You!!</li>
    <li> Super Quality and a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; price!  Paula makes no claims that can&#x27;t be substantiated and while vitamin C is expensive, her&#x27;s is about as reasonable as it gets for something of such quality and potency!</li>
    <li> Would not purchase.  Lid did not fit so the serum did not last</li>
    <li> Meh, didn&#x27;t notice much difference. I used the expensive skincueticals and tried to downgrade to this, but noticed no improvement.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> It really works. It smoothed out wrinkles in my forehead that were there after using sporadically for a few weeks. Deep, deep wrinkles. I am beyond amazed.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and saw my dermatologist. She prescribed mirvaso ($90.00 cream) that hurt my face and made the condition worse. I carefully researched the condition, purchased The Body Shop Tea Tree Skin Clearing Facial Wash, Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid, Resist C15 Super Booster (a vitimin C and E lotion) and the Eminence Blueberry Soy Night Recovery Cream. It didn&#x27;t hurt my face (just a little sting with the BHA Liquid but nothing like the harsh &amp;#34;medicine&amp;#34; the doctor prescribed) and my skin is much improved. I use the Blueberry Soy as a day moisturizer too and add MD Solar Sciences Tinted Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50. I was not paid for this review and I don&#x27;t write them often but the products made such a difference I thought other women would really benefit.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to be picked to try this product!  I have a decent sized brown spot on my nose and a few areas of my face so of course I was willing to try the serum!  I mean who doesn&#x27;t want better looking skin, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a consumer, I love how involved they are with the community, that they offer a 100% money back guarantee and that they do no animal testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as a product review and did it work for me?  Well, yes and no.  I used three drops two times a day.  It faded the spot a little and did brighten up my skin a bit, however, not the way I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you purchase a full size product of Paula&#x27;s Choice Resist C15 Booster, you will pay $48 for .67 fl.  on Paula&#x27;s Choice website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, for that price point and the ok results I achieved, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product for myself.  I really had wished it worked better than it did.  I want that spot and some other brown spots gone and I&#x27;m hoping someday I will find a product that actually removes the spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to BzzAgent and Paula&#x27;s Choice for letting me try the booster.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast delivery. No problems!</li>
    <li> This seems to do a good job of moisturizing, although its heavy and sticky. Thing is, it also makes me break out. And it does nothing for dark circles under your eyes, I&#x27;ve used it two weeks straight.</li>
    <li> Love this product. My second bottle. It has improved the look and feel of my skin. I use it nightly.</li>
    <li> Oh man I love this stuff.. I got a sample in my birch box and I&#x27;m addicted... Cleared my face up and made it look glowy ... Thank goodness!!!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the mail and liked it so much I purchased a full size bottle.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and love the way it makes my face feel.  It also seems to lessen the look of my wrinkles which is a bonus!</li>
    <li> I got a sample and so far I love it. [...] enjoy!</li>
    <li> Wow. It does what it says it will do. brightens my skin within minutes of applying and lasts all the next day. even my husband noticed and thats saying a lot. hes been looking tired with dull skin lately and this gives him an instant pick me up. brighter more radiant skin. its frequently on sale. remember that after three months the vitamin c is no longer effective. if my husband and i didnt use this together, id buy the deluxe sample size for myself, or id buy another glass dark bottle (light diminished the effectiveness of the vit c) and store half my paulas choice vit c in it in the fridge, to stretch out those 3 months of effectiveness to 5.  anyway. my only concern is...am i hooked on this? if i stop using it will my skin keep its brightness or get dull again soon? truth be told i dont actually need to be this bright.</li>
