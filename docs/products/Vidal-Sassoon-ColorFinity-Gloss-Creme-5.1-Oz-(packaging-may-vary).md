### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an excellent product for a leave-in and enhances shine without being oily.</li>
      <li>But I think it works best on damp hair.</li>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>I think the best of the three is about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>I had purchased this specifically to add shine to my color treated hair, but have discovered that it is the very best thing I have ever found to deal with staticy fly-away hair.</li>
      <li>Very good product.</li>
      <li>great i love this!!!  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>But leaves my hair feeling great</li>

      <li>Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>This is good stuff for men</li>
      <li>It has a tendency to get frizzy (even at this length) during the humid Georgia summers, and it just doesn&#x27;t look as good at those times.  </li>
      <li>Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>It didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or heaviness, which I liked a lot.</li>
      <li>Oh.. and it also makes it nice and shiny.</li>
      <li>It works best if you use it right after you wash your hair and then put a quarter sized amount (more or less-whatever works for you.</li>
      <li>Nothing I have tried, including Static Guard, has help, but this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine and when the Santa Anas blow here in California I look like a crazed Chia pet.</li>
      <li>Nice and easy to work with.  </li>
      <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
      <li>I would compare it to many higher-end salon products.  </li>

      <li>What I was super impressed with is that my hair after it dried, was SUPER soft and very shiny!</li>

      <li>So Much Vidal Sassoon!</li>
      <li>I guess I will be stalking this product for a price reduction and buy some more in the future.</li>
      <li>But with slightly damp hair, it&#x27;s easy to distribute evenly and easy to comb my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Third, it&#x27;s fairly easy to wash off my hands.  </li>
      <li>Since I did see some improvement, since the cost is low, and since it&#x27;s an easy product to work with, I&#x27;ll go ahead and give 4 stars.r.  </li>

      <li>Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  </li>
      <li>it makes my hair look a little bit shiny but overall great product to use.</li>
      <li>I needed something that left my hair smooth after it dries.</li>
      <li>The Vidal Sassoon does stay in my hair and it does smooth out my hair (only for max 8 hours after putting it on though).</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and it softens the curls and keeps the curls together.</li>
      <li>Too soon, and I don&#x27;t really feel like it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I really really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product does not make much of a difference in terms of keeping tangles from forming throughout the course of the day.  </li>
      <li>do think my hair is shiny after using this, though it was reasonably shiny before, as well.  </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable since most cremes do cost roughly $5-$7 depending on size and brand.</li>
      <li>My secret to natural looking beautiful curls is this gloss!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Many products weight my hair down and make me look like a scraggly animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now when I brush it, my hair was back to its original soft, wavy and curly beautifullness that it was before I ever colored my hair.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  </li>
      <li>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  </li>
      <li>I use just a small amount on dry, styled hair and instantly the static is gone and my hair remains fly-away free all day.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried applying this product at three different times: immediately upon getting out of the shower (with lightly towel-dried hair), about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower, and when my hair was completely dry.  </li>
      <li>First, this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, even though I have to use a large amount.  </li>
      <li>I use it for styling my naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>, as far as APPLYING hair treatments goes, this one has a lot of advantages.  </li>
      <li>I think the frizz might have been reduced some, but my hair doesn&#x27;t really come close to looking like a shampoo commercial.  </li>
      <li>it made my hair soft but not shiny..</li>
      <li>, as far as APPLYING hair treatments goes, this one has a lot of advantages.  </li>
      <li>I almost cried because I now have my hair back to its normal self again.</li>
      <li>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, it does make my hair a little easier to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
    <li> I purchased this gloss creme because it happened to be on sale, and I actually didn&#x27;t think I would even like it. Now I wish I had purchased more :(  I use this to dampen my hair when I brush it back into a ponytail and it does a GREAT keeping my hair together. I really really like this stuff. I guess I will be stalking this product for a price reduction and buy some more in the future. 5 stars from me.</li>
    <li> I had just decided one day to try it on my hair,just a few days ago my hair was so awful,it was stringy, and rubbery, and broke off every time I brushed it.Now when I brush it, my hair was back to its original soft, wavy and curly beautifullness that it was before I ever colored my hair.It felt like there was never any damage to it.I&#x27;m serious.I can;t recommend this product enough.I almost cried because I now have my hair back to its normal self again.Thank You So Much Vidal Sassoon! This is the only hair repair product I will ever buy.Seriously.Please give this a try.Before you go to the salon and spend a ton of money trying to fix your hair if it is severely damaged, just pick up this product in stores, it is only $4.95. That price for a miracle? YES PLEASE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this specifically to add shine to my color treated hair, but have discovered that it is the very best thing I have ever found to deal with staticy fly-away hair. My hair is very fine and when the Santa Anas blow here in California I look like a crazed Chia pet. Nothing I have tried, including Static Guard, has help, but this product is amazing. I use just a small amount on dry, styled hair and instantly the static is gone and my hair remains fly-away free all day. Oh.. and it also makes it nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
    <li> Ordered many times before.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This is good stuff for men</li>
    <li> I used this for about 10 days in a row and saw no improvement.  In fact, it seemed to dry out my hair and leave it frizzy on the ends.</li>
    <li> This was recommended as a hair gel sibstitue for frizzy hair and works well. I don&#x27;t die my hair so I can&#x27;t comment on the color part. But leaves my hair feeling great and I can actually style it with this and it stays better than light hold gels.</li>
    <li> Does the job, tames my wild thick hair.  It does that for a fraction of what you would pay for other products like this.</li>
    <li> This is one of my ALL time favorite hair products. I use it for styling my naturally curly hair. It defines my curls without having a sticky feel to it. It even smells nice! If you have curly hair that&#x27;s frizzy, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair and let it dry I pump some in my hand and define my curls. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard at all, my hair is soft to the touch when I use it. My secret to natural looking beautiful curls is this gloss!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Although I love the actual product (which is the reason I rated it five stars), when I opened the packaging I was sad to see that there was a crack in the bottle, and it was leaking everywhere. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to return it to get a refund because it&#x27;s just such a hassle. I&#x27;m probably just going to patch it up! Hopefully that doesn&#x27;t happen to anyone else!*</li>
    <li> it made my hair soft but not shiny..i wanted it to work tho because i wanted my long hair to shine..</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair soft and shiny. I have very curly hair and it softens the curls and keeps the curls together. Doesn&#x27;t feel like there is anything on your hair after it dries.</li>
    <li> Just ok, doesn&#x27;t really give shine.  Leaves a film on hair.  I prefer Paul Mitchell skinny serum.  This stuff does smell amazing and would probably work great for someone who has thick hair.  Now with a coupon I paid only a $1 for this so wouldn&#x27;t buy again but does everything it claims but make my hair shiny.</li>

    <li> it makes my hair look a little bit shiny but overall great product to use.</li>
    <li> This is a review for Vidal Sassoon ColorFinity Gloss Creme, 5.1 oz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a hard time finding hair products that work well for me.  I have fine, thin, straight hair that is slightly layered and shoulder-length.  Many products weight my hair down and make me look like a scraggly animal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this when I get out of the shower, mostly on the ends, but I&#x27;ve used it all over my hair, too.  I find that it helps to protect my hair when blow-drying.  It also eliminates the fly-aways and frizziness after drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product helps to make my hair look sleek, but it does not prevent my from being able to style it in a more voluminous manner, if I so choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also will use some of this on the ends of my hair, prior to having it colored.  This seems to help keep it from breaking around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, and the price is very reasonable.  I would compare it to many higher-end salon products.  It is worth at least three times the discount store price that I paid for it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and a half, and I&#x27;m having mixed feelings about it.  I think perhaps it&#x27;s not exactly the product I need, but I&#x27;ll go ahead and share my experience and hopefully the information will help someone out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have thick, waist-length, straight, color-treated hair.  It has a tendency to get frizzy (even at this length) during the humid Georgia summers, and it just doesn&#x27;t look as good at those times.  (Note: I do not use any kind of blow dryer nor do I ever apply heat to my hair.)  I was hoping this product would improve the appearance of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think my hair is shiny after using this, though it was reasonably shiny before, as well.  I think the frizz might have been reduced some, but my hair doesn&#x27;t really come close to looking like a shampoo commercial.  This product does not make much of a difference in terms of keeping tangles from forming throughout the course of the day.  In my case, it does not add body, but since I don&#x27;t want to add body, this is all right.  I do actually like that it seems to make my hair lie a bit flatter against me.  I also have to use a lot more than the dime-sized amount recommended by the bottle to see any effect at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of things I do like.  First, this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, even though I have to use a large amount.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel sticky or greasy or oily.  Third, it&#x27;s fairly easy to wash off my hands.  Fourth, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.  Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, it does make my hair a little easier to comb out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried applying this product at three different times: immediately upon getting out of the shower (with lightly towel-dried hair), about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower, and when my hair was completely dry.  I think the best of the three is about 30 minutes after getting out of the shower.  Too soon, and I don&#x27;t really feel like it \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; to my hair.  With dry hair, it&#x27;s difficult to distribute the product evenly in my hair.  But with slightly damp hair, it&#x27;s easy to distribute evenly and easy to comb my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m having a hard time assigning this product a rating.  One the one hand, as far as APPLYING hair treatments goes, this one has a lot of advantages.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  Subtle changes, yes, and they ARE improvements.  But nothing stunning or dramatic.  (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, and I love the shampoo and conditioner from the same line.  I think this just might not be what I need.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product is cheap enough that it is certainly worth a try.  I suspect people with other hair textures and lengths, or other styling goals, might find a lot to like.  Since I did see some improvement, since the cost is low, and since it&#x27;s an easy product to work with, I&#x27;ll go ahead and give 4 stars.r.  With dry hair, it&#x27;s difficult to distribute the product evenly in my hair.  But with slightly damp hair, it&#x27;s easy to distribute evenly and easy to comb my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I&#x27;m having a hard time assigning this product a rating.  One the one hand, as far as APPLYING hair treatments goes, this one has a lot of advantages.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m not noticing a huge difference in the appearance of my hair.  Subtle changes, yes, and they ARE improvements.  But nothing stunning or dramatic.  (I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad product, and I love the shampoo and conditioner from the same line.  I think this just might not be what I need.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this product is cheap enough that it is certainly worth a try.

    <li> I&#x27;m an African American with relaxed hair and I wasn&#x27;t sure how this was gonna work for me but it&#x27;s great. It works best if you use it right after you wash your hair and then put a quarter sized amount (more or less-whatever works for you. I have short hair) on your hands and work it through your hair. Then blow dry it. Or air dry it, if you prefer. But I think it works best on damp hair. Afterwards my hair felt super soft and light. It didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or heaviness, which I liked a lot. I would buy this again, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> great i love this!!!  What I was super impressed with is that my hair after it dried, was SUPER soft and very shiny!</li>
    <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Okay, nothing fabulous!  Comparable to all the other glossers out there.  Don&#x27;t overuse or too greasy.</li>
