      <li>Avery good buy.</li>
      <li>Price was good, works like a charm.</li>
      <li>Good foot scraper.</li>
      <li>good product..fast shipment</li>
      <li>Thank you for good service.</li>
      <li>Does a fairly good job trimming callus areas.</li>
      <li>Loved this item and *</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>so i liked this purchase for that reason</li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>Happy, thanks!</li>
      <li>and I love it, so</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>And why all the typos in the instruction manual (I&#x27;ve come to expect more from the Germans).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not quite sure why....</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>Not a bad deal!</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Fine for the cheap price.</li>
      <li>I bought an amazing pumice scrub at the same time and have honestly had no need for this.</li>
      <li>Very useful tool.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use, took tons off my cracked heels and never cut myself once.</li>
      <li>probably worth the price!</li>
      <li>This is easy to use and does a great job of trimming down calluses on feet</li>
      <li>But it does great on my rough feet.  </li>
      <li>Great, just be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
      <li>I liked it very much would highly recommend</li>
      <li>Have used this product for about 4 years and keeps my feet looking nice all year--never have dry, crusty or callused areas.  </li>
      <li>but when you first start using it, caution should be used not to overtrim as you can cut your foot.  </li>
      <li>If you live near a Jack 99cent store, or can find one easily, pick one up from there.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t pay much - so</li>
      <li>It seems to work very well when I was using it.  </li>
      <li>I was surprised how easy it was to use and how quickly the dry skin just peeled off.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This works really well.</li>
      <li>I also like that new blades came with it.</li>
      <li>The blades are not as sharp and clean shaving as I had hope, the callus remover I bought this one to replace (I had misplaced my original) cost me only a $1 and is (I found it again) much sharper and cleaner shaving that this one.</li>
      <li>Seller shipped fast - packaged well - product is low quality - would not recommend.</li>
      <li>It works really well especially for the price</li>
      <li>My set is complete now</li>
      <li>This is a very effective tool for removing thick dead skin on feet.  </li>
      <li>The name is just really too long.</li>
      <li>At first I thought it was because the blade grew dull after the first use, but when I changed the blade (it comes with a set), the same thing happened.</li>
      <li>Apparently this is not a letter opener.  </li>
      <li>just what I expected thanks</li>
      <li>Have also used a pummace stone, which is good for small problem spots or touch ups, but use this at least every 4-6 weeks.</li>

<li> What a great tool for those nasty callus&#x27; that form.</li>
<li> As with any product that does this, extreme care if you are diabetic.</li>
<li> works like a charm, very sharp, gotta be careful</li>
<li> This product really works, goodbye expensive salon pedicures!</li>
<li> Kinda hard to use.</li>

    <li> just what I expected thanks</li>
    <li> The blades are not as sharp and clean shaving as I had hope, the callus remover I bought this one to replace (I had misplaced my original) cost me only a $1 and is (I found it again) much sharper and cleaner shaving that this one. At first I thought it was because the blade grew dull after the first use, but when I changed the blade (it comes with a set), the same thing happened. Boo. If you live near a Jack 99cent store, or can find one easily, pick one up from there. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a year and still the blade works well.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Should have gotten this months again!!</li>
    <li> works great i have very thick rough callus&#x27; on my big toes and this cut them off easy.  great product</li>
    <li> Works great, used on my husband&#x27;s feet. Just be careful not to go to deep with the blade. I also like that new blades came with it.</li>
    <li> It works on feet that look like they have been on a Walk about in the Australian Bush.</li>
    <li> Kinda hard to use. I bought an amazing pumice scrub at the same time and have honestly had no need for this. Also was a reasonably long delivery time in comparison to having things delivered within 2 days.</li>
    <li> Thank you for good service. Very useful tool.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Super easy to use, took tons off my cracked heels and never cut myself once. Total lifesaver.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever. It did take forever to arrive but I love it.</li>
    <li> This works really well. I was surprised how easy it was to use and how quickly the dry skin just peeled off. I will buy again if I need too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;m really happy with it.  It works perfectly.</li>
    <li> This product really works, goodbye expensive salon pedicures!</li>
    <li> Love this! It works really well especially for the price</li>
    <li> very nice design...works great!!</li>
    <li> Does a fairly good job trimming callus areas. As with any product that does this, extreme care if you are diabetic.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and I&#x27;ve never encountered any wound yet in the entire length of my use. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I must be clumsy because it&#x27;s very hard to put together and once I think I have it there, it falls apart.</li>
    <li> Not very good quality, quite disappointed since I had to wait so long to get them</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and does a great job of trimming down calluses on feet but when you first start using it, caution should be used not to overtrim as you can cut your foot.  Until you get a feel for using the trimmer, it&#x27;s best to undertrim than to cut the foot.

Have also used a pummace stone, which is good for small problem spots or touch ups, but use this at least every 4-6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive. Was shipped from China. Also, the instructions had lots of typographical errors. The box said it&#x27;s Made in Germany, but then why was it shipped from China? And why all the typos in the instruction manual (I&#x27;ve come to expect more from the Germans).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, the product works great and I love it, so it gets five stars. But I&#x27;m still a bit puzzled about why it came from China.</li>
    <li> Price was good, works like a charm. No need to pay for overpriced sap items when they all do the same job. Happy, thanks!</li>
    <li> Sturdy and does the job well.</li>
    <li> this thing did not even work it did not even go against your skin i threw it away dont throw away your money after reading this</li>
    <li> The name is just really too long.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective tool for removing thick dead skin on feet.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I liked it very much would highly recommend</li>
    <li> Good foot scraper. I recommend to do the scraping over the toilet- it&#x27;s pretty disgusting!</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with product</li>
    <li> Threw it in the trash. It took out chunks of skin.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped fast - packaged well - product is low quality - would not recommend. I didn&#x27;t pay much - so probably worth the price!</li>
    <li> yes. just utube how to use it if you don&#x27;t already know. this is the sh*t for removing callouses.</li>
    <li> Fine for the cheap price. Delivery takes weeks from China.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work as well as my last one. Not quite sure why....</li>
    <li> What a great tool for those nasty callus&#x27; that form. Easy to use. The blade can be used on both edges so you get a lot of use before changing the blade. Avery good buy. I ordered several.</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely matter, im a skater so my feet constantly builds extra skin. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Have only use it once.  It seems to work very well when I was using it.  I like the extra part, which is included.</li>
    <li> good product..fast shipment</li>
    <li> Apparently this is not a letter opener.  And it does not fetch a tennis ball.  But it does great on my rough feet.  You get the refill blades, the grater piece and the handle.  Not a bad deal!</li>
    <li> Not the color I wanted.  I already had an orange one.  I was hoping for blue.  I didn&#x27;t bother replying or sending them back.</li>
    <li> Loved this item and ***** 5 star</li>
    <li> Great, just be careful not to cut yourself.</li>
    <li> great product. I buy these at walmart but they dont come with enough blades so i liked this purchase for that reason</li>
    <li> works like a charm, very sharp, gotta be careful</li>
    <li> Works well.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I could not figure out how to put this together. I kept it too long to send back and ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I have been needing one of these for the longest. Gonna save me a lot of money doing it at home than going to the salon. My set is complete now I also have a foot spa that I use along with this</li>
    <li> Blade is sharp, advise to use it carefully to avoid deep cut.</li>
