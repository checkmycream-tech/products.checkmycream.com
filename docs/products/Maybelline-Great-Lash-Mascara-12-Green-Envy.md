      <li>Maybe I got an old product but it was fairly dry,the little that did go on looked blackish,would not recommend</li>
      <li>When I saw this mascara advertised I went straight to Amazon and ordered it.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing to have an alternative to black.</li>
      <li>people don&#x27;t realize you have green mascara on until light hits your eyelashes at just the right angle</li>
      <li>old loves it!!</li>
      <li>i bought the green and absolutely love it..</li>

      <li>I highly rec applying white before this color!</li>
      <li>Love the shade of green, but it takes several strokes to get enough on your lashes.</li>
      <li>Color is rather teal than grass green as I expected, but it was OK.</li>
      <li>The green is extremely flattering and I&#x27;m just hoping this product will always be available!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m ready to try some of the other colors now as well.</li>
      <li>Does not dry out or flake.</li>
      <li>I always get Royal Blue from Maybelline, but this is the first time I saw Green Envy.</li>
      <li>and when I think it may be a bit much I can simply go over it a bit with some black mascara .  </li>

    <li> Tired of the same old mascara? Pair this color with a teal liner for a pop of spring. After searching fruitlessly for this color which I had heard about, Amazon came through for me. It&#x27;s my go to for spring and early summer looks.</li>
    <li> I like Maybelline and the special colors add a special look when wanted.  The smug factor is very low even in heat.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got an old product but it was fairly dry,the little that did go on looked blackish,would not recommend</li>
    <li> The product came quickly and was a beautiful teal green color which was just as advertised. This product can&#x27;t be found in stores so I was glad to see it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Good mascara. No complains. Color is rather teal than grass green as I expected, but it was OK. Overall nice product</li>
    <li> Because I take a star off for the complicated nature of the stroller and another for the parts that break/come apart easily.</li>
    <li> I love this new color mascara.. i bought the green and absolutely love it.. you can just brush it on and put some lipstick and be on your way.. it makes your eyes pop...</li>
    <li> Great green color and goes on smooth.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m a connoisseur of colored mascaras and this one is one that I will not be repurchasing. It clumps like crazy straight out of the tube and the color payoff is just so-so. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in my local stores - love to wear it in Green!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the blue color and loved it, but with hazel eyes it didn&#x27;t look quite right. This green really brings out the color of my eyes. I have never seen it in the stores. Will be ordering more to hide away.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the shade of.green. I thought I would be getting a darker green but.....no! It Is really more of a teal. I would never order this again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, the color is perfect for making your eye color pop.  I wish it was easier to find!</li>
    <li> Get plenty of compliments.  My eyes are green so the green on lashes really stand out.  Does not dry out or flake.</li>
    <li> The result is underwhelming. I don&#x27;t see so much color (green) while my lashes are blond.</li>
    <li> Got in time well packaging , I thought the color will be brighter  , but all I. All it good</li>
    <li> This would be better if it were more product coming out on the lashes.  Not enought produce coming onto the lases in my opinion, to even enjoy the color!</li>

    <li> This mascara is amazing! It&#x27;s so refreshing to have an alternative to black. I&#x27;ve received several compliments on it because it&#x27;s different and brightens up your eyes! I want to get all different colors!!!</li>
    <li> This really makes your eyes pop and not in a buggy eye way! lol I love the green mascara look and when I think it may be a bit much I can simply go over it a bit with some black mascara .
