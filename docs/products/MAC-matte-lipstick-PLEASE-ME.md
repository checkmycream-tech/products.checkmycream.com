      <li>Gorgeous color and amazing formula.</li>
      <li>The lipstick was too pink for me but perfect for my best friend.</li>
      <li>This color is very very beautiful though ;)</li>
      <li>It looks smooth and beautiful on.</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>

      <li>I liked the color.</li>
      <li>Great color - requires a top coat for a better look.</li>
      <li>Shipping was very fast and I loved the color!</li>
      <li>Please make sure you read reviews before buying anything online.</li>

      <li>love this lipstick I always use it</li>
      <li>The color is OK but not by itself.</li>
      <li>After very significant qualities.</li>
      <li>Colors, super nice, my favorite color.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good lipstick.</li>
      <li>so your lips need to be smooth and hydrated for this lipstick to achieve the &#x27;matte look&#x27; that we LOVE to see in magazines or on our fav celebrity stars...</li>
      <li>Over all a good everyday shade that would look good with so many looks .</li>
      <li>Well, so much the better.</li>
      <li>Can you give me discount then so much the better, but when.</li>
      <li>It wore off pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is my first experience with MAC lipstick.</li>
      <li>I advise to buy a sugar lip scrub prior to use.. Enjoy!</li>
      <li>, you&#x27;re better off going to the actual MAC store or the REAL MAC website.</li>
      <li>This is mac matte finish medium pink color with yellow undertones ,one of those shades that would look good on pretty much every skin tone.</li>
      <li>Haha</li>
      <li>It’s very glossy rather than matte.</li>
      <li>I was surprised at how horribly dry and sticky it was.</li>

<li> Hard to believe this is a real MAC lipstick.</li>
<li> so it stays for long time</li>
<li> However once I put it on it was very dry ?</li>
<li> When I got my package, it was crushed</li>
<li> Not worth the price though.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s a little drying</li>
<li> Not sure why… Maybe the sun had damaged it during shipping…</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t think this lipstick would be quite so thick and dull.  </li>
<li> Fake Fake FAKE!</li>
<li> Then you won’t end up like all the 1 stars down here, disappointed!</li>
<li> THIS IS THE WORST FAKE MAC LIPSTICK I HAVE EVER</li>
<li> FAKE!!!</li>
<li> Quality was horrible.</li>

    <li> FAKE!!! DO NOT BUY THIS EVER!!!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think this lipstick would be quite so thick and dull.  It wore off pretty quickly.  I liked the color.</li>
    <li> love this lipstick I always use it</li>
    <li> Fake Fake FAKE! Please don&#x27;t not buy this, you&#x27;re better off going to the actual MAC store or the REAL MAC website.</li>
    <li> Well, so much the better. Colors, super nice, my favorite color. After very significant qualities. After this would be able to buy. Can you give me discount then so much the better, but when. Haha</li>
    <li> The color doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. This is clearer</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, for the price you pay you would think this is legit MAC. However once I put it on it was very dry ? Not sure why… Maybe the sun had damaged it during shipping… Idk. It’s very glossy rather than matte. Please make sure you read reviews before buying anything online. Then you won’t end up like all the 1 stars down here, disappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good lipstick. Not worth the price though. &amp; the color is different than the picture. When I got my package, it was crushed (I realize that&#x27;s not the company&#x27;s fault but maybe it could help them out to know what delivery company NOT to ship with)</li>
    <li> Great color - requires a top coat for a better look.</li>
    <li> Quality was horrible. Hard to believe this is a real MAC lipstick.</li>
    <li> The MAC lipstick picture and the actual color is very different.  The lipstick was too pink for me but perfect for my best friend.</li>
    <li> It is exactaly what I thought and was hoping for. It looks smooth and beautiful on. Got it for a great price!</li>
    <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;The item was very nice as I expected&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color and amazing formula. Love this!</li>
    <li> its matte ladies... so your lips need to be smooth and hydrated for this lipstick to achieve the &#x27;matte look&#x27; that we LOVE to see in magazines or on our fav celebrity stars... some days it looks great, some days my lips looked cracked with this lipstick. I advise to buy a sugar lip scrub prior to use.. Enjoy! This color is very very beautiful though ;)</li>
    <li> Shipping was very fast and I loved the color! MAC is great.</li>
    <li> This is mac matte finish medium pink color with yellow undertones ,one of those shades that would look good on pretty much every skin tone. It&#x27;s a matte finish so it stays for long time but it&#x27;s a little drying so you have to put a balm underneath.it has a vanilla scent like all mac lipsticks . Over all a good everyday shade that would look good with so many looks .</li>
    <li> Amazing color. Great seller</li>
    <li> Great color, although is matte doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE WORST FAKE MAC LIPSTICK I HAVE EVER CAME ACROSS,...IM GOING TO GET A REFUND..i WOULD NOT HAVE GIVEN IT ONE STAR BUT IT MADE ME...ITS A MATTE LIPSTICK...SO TELL ME WHY IT GOES ON AS A GLOSS?</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with MAC lipstick. I was surprised at how horribly dry and sticky it was. The color is OK but not by itself.</li>
