Sock are very comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose they also sell one that cover more leg, but these are perfect when all you want to moisturize is your fee.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it, I would buy it again and the packaging and delivery were perfect.</li>

    <li> They feel good on my feet, but I was hoping for the ones like Earth Therapeutics made before, which are more soothing and last longer. These are not the same.

    <li> i bought these to have a counter color to some blue moisturizing socks i&#x27;d bought. Well, i opened the package and took out the socks to brag to my teen son. Guess what? HE took them - he loves them. and seriously, if i can get a 15 year old boy to take any notice of his feet, I&#x27;ll take having my socks stolen.</li>
    <li> These socks are really really soft. They make my feet really soft. Every time I take off the sock, I get fuzzies on my feet from the socks. I love wearing them.</li>
    <li> I wear these with my gym shoes and blisters are a thing of the past.  Great comfort!  I highly recommend them to all.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my parents. They are enjoying them. Socks keep their feet soft. Needed to wash a few time to get rid of fluff.</li>
