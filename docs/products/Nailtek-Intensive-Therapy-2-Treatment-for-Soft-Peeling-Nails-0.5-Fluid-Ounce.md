<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the best product for growing healthy natural nails.  Use this once a day and you will never where false nails again.  This is an awesome price</li>
    <li> Perfect. Prompt shipping and received product as described.</li>
    <li> Am not sure why my nails began breaking, peeling, bending, but this stuff has solved all the problems.  I apply one coat and the protection is in place.  My nails are even beginning to grow out.  I put on one coat a day for 2 or 3 days, then remove it and start all over with one coat.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with color nail polish, but the application is so smooth that I imagine polish will glide on easily.  Great product!</li>
    <li> great product and the only thing that grew my nails.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before, very good</li>
    <li> It works the way it says it will. Im in love with this product.</li>
    <li> My nails have honestly never grown before this product and I am 54 years old!  I ordered it by reading the reviews and if you follow the directions you won&#x27;t want to go spend all that money on gel nails.  This gives you the same look and feel (almost) for a FRACTION of the cost!  You must put it on everyday and take it off once a week though or it will build up and peel off.</li>
    <li> If you have problems growing your nails this what you need</li>
    <li> This did not do anything to make my nails feel stronger or keep them from cracking or peeling.  It says to reapply everyday but what you end up with is a very thick, soft layer of this stuff on your nails and it just peels right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, the search continues.  My nails are damaged from years of acrylic nails.  They get about to the end of my finger and then the corners crack and the nail peels right off.  I really hoped this would help but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
    <li> I used this product for 5 years and loved it.  In the last year the formula changed and now lit doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
    <li> Great product and it did strengthen my nails. Use it as a base coat and top coat. My nails were healthy but the edge would peel off so I purchase this product and I can see the improvement. I have used this product previously and had a good result back then. Also I noticed the polish lasts longer when I top this off as a topcoat too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> No complaints..... received timely and item works perfectly</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 or so years &amp; very rarely have a broken nail. I keep my nails coated in this 24/7.</li>
    <li> After being ill from the flu for two weeks I noticed how not only my body was weak but so were my fingernails. They had become paper thin and were splitting in the middle which made it almost impossible to even have a fingernail much less lengthy ones. After researching nail strengtheners on amazon I came across this one, Nailtek Intensive Therapy II treatment for soft nails, and couldn&#x27;t believe the amount of great reviews. After a month my nails are not only back to normal they are in better condition. This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add this also... When I first removed this polish/treatment from my nails so I could start over again I at first thought I wasn&#x27;t getting it all off because my nails had actually improved so much that they have a stronger, healthier texture now. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Servizio eccellente!!</li>
    <li> This nail polish makes my nails grow faster and healthier.</li>
    <li> ordered by mistake.  have used for a long time and never saw  an improvement</li>
    <li> i cant really tell, it might have made my naisl stronger and grow. but i think ti also turned them yellow and sort of did the same for my actually nails. i took it off. the affect was not permanent.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good for peeling nails.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as instructed on the bottle, and my nails are still very brittle, chip a lot, and break a lot. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for weak and spitting nails.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great to strengthen weak nails. Have used it for years. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It has hardened my nails up really good.  It is also an amazing top coat!  Apply a coat before color and one after color and then apply daily.  Update:  So it has been over a year of using this product and I official no longer have the need for acrylics or gel manicures.  My nails grow fast, hard, and rarely ever break (I keep them long most times so you can&#x27;t avoid breakage altogether).  This is amazing stuff and well worth the price.  I keep a bottle at my desk at work and also at home.</li>
    <li> It does strengthen my nails while I&#x27;m wearing it, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lasting effect when I go back to regular nail products.</li>
    <li> Great price compared to my nail salon or other retailers. The packaging was legit! I have the weakest, most brittle nails and this product has changed everything!! I use every day/following the instructions and in only a month I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference!</li>
    <li> cured my peeling nails from Jamberry removal.  Love this</li>
    <li> did nothing for me, but I have very problem nails</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I love it.</li>
    <li> You have to apply it every day but it WORKS!  I&#x27;ve tried SO many products to try to heal my soft, peeling nails, especially on my thumbs, and this is the only thing that has worked!  Much cheaper than other &amp;#34;nail repair&amp;#34; products too (which are usually about $10 per bottle).  Just make sure you remove all the layers of polish about once a week or the buildup will peel off.  If you&#x27;re diligent about using it every day, it really works!</li>
    <li> Recieved very quickly and it works great! Very satisfied :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful price. Shipped quickly.  I have used this product several years for soft, peeling nails and it is the only product that allows me to grow nails.  It is great if you will use it as directed.</li>
    <li> i cannot live wfantasticithout it</li>
    <li> Good product.  Put it on after nail polish and it dries perfectly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this polish. Its the only polish that has actually made a physical difference in the strength of my nails. I actually HAVE nails now and can even put colored nail polish on that doesn&#x27;t peel off because my nails are flimsy. No more flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that after a period of time of using it you need to switch to the maintenance by NailTek to prevent them from peeling. While they are significantly harder they will peel differently for lack of a better explanation with chunkier peeling. Keep an eye on your nails and they will be beautiful!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, if you wanna go to a quick dance or something.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t last that long,  and you can see the streaks on where you put it at.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Nailtek Intensive Therapy is the only thing I will use for a base coat. My nails only grow and remain strong when I use Nailtek. My nails no longer peel and are not brittle. This is the most awesome product ever. I will always be a loyal NailTek user! My nails thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for difficult fingernails.  I like it a lot.  Works great.</li>
    <li> My nails are growing like crazy and as strong as acrylic.  LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I have extremely brittle nails and was desperate for a solution. When I use this product my nails are harder. Be sure to use every day.</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised - prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  I use it every time I give myself a manicure.  It has helped my nails, along with using oil on my cuticles every day.</li>
    <li> wife loves it! was recommended by a nail technician and she uses it since then.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well and the price can&#x27;t be beat. My nails tend to crack or splinter when I do my handy-man jobs around the house; this product has eliminated most of these incidents.</li>
    <li> This really does the job. Nothing else I have used stopped my nails from breaking, peeling, chipping the polish, etc. I&#x27;m serious. Nail Tek II works!  Follow instructions on the box, especially the part about applying daily, taking off weekly, etc. Also I had to get some super heavy duty polish remover to get this off my nails. But it was easy to find and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Best product for fingernails. Much cheaper thru Amazon too.</li>
    <li> It made my nails worse!</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference with strength, but I loved the shine it gave.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this yet but gave it a high rating because it came highly rated from a friend.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Nailtek! I had paper thin, soft nails all my life. They could fold and not break. I did the acrylic tips thing all through high school until college when I became tired of trying to keep up with expensive fillings. I went for a regular manicur and the manicurist told me she had something to fix the sad state of my nails if I promised to come back to ber every week (the manis were $6 so it wouldn&#x27;t hurt) then handed me my first bottle of Nailtek. This stuff is so amazing! After a few months of using it as directed it got my nails to the point where I no longer had to use it and manicurists would always comment on how \\&quot;beautiful\\&quot; and \\&quot;strong\\&quot; my nails were. Fast forward to years later.....I HAD to order some now because I haven&#x27;t uses any Nailtek on over a year and my peeling nails are screaming for it. Can&#x27;t wait to get back to beautiful natural nails!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery at a great price. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great product recommended by a friend who does nails.  My nails were soft and peeled.  This product performed above expectation!  After 4 weeks my nails are stronger, and growing longer!</li>
    <li> This literally saved my life! I came across this product from a blogger I think who reviewed this product. I&#x27;m really happy with it. My nails were becoming really thin from acrylics and shellac. I usually put a coat of naill tek under and over a coat of regular nail polish. If I&#x27;m super lazy, I only put a few coats of Nail Tek and it makes my nails look shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> I do not recommend as this product dried out my nails and even though they were harder, they would easily chip due to the dryness. Instead, I&#x27;ve been using the OPI Nail Envy and I am loving it.</li>
    <li> Great! Easy to apply and dries fast!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Durable and stays on my nails even in dish washing and other cleaning.</li>
    <li> If you have peeling nails, I&#x27;ve found Xtra for Previously Unsalvaeable Nails, NK14000, by Nail Tek works the best. This would be my second choice.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working OK  -</li>
    <li> This really helps my nails....Thanks</li>
    <li> used nailtek II in the past but haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see positive results</li>
    <li> This product has really worked for me and I was desperate and had tried many other products.  I&#x27;ve always had lovely strong long nails and suddenly they were starting to peel and split.  I saw this recommendation for my type of nail problem and decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve been using it every day for 3 months (taking it off on Sundays and starting over), and now I&#x27;ve only one nail that still tends to split.  I use a good nail glue product on it which halts the split and use the Nail Tek II on top of it.  The rest are growing out long, hard and perfect again!</li>
    <li> I purchased both the intensive therapy and ridge filling foundation, used both together, and it bonded my soft, badly peeling nails back together. But only for about a day and a half, then the tips of my nails chipped off, polish and nail together! I also wash my hands, a lot, which is probably why the nails are so bad to begin with! I am wearing them by themselves, and they are not yellowing either. Formaldehyde is considered one of the toxic three, and has been removed from most popular polishes sold in this country. Many of the studies done identified it as a carcinogen that is harmful when inhaled by form. Here is a list of ingredients in this product: ethyl acetate, sd alcohol 40b, butyl acetate, nitrocellulose, tosylamide/formaldehyde resin, acrylates copolymer, triphenyl phosphate, trimethyl pentanyl diisobutyrate, isopropyl alcohol, butyl alcohol, formaldehyde, benzophenone-1, hydrolyzed wheat protien, dimethicone, calcium panthothenate, violet #2. I am posting a very similar review for the other nail Tek product also. This product dries to a matte finish, and doesn&#x27;t make much of a noticeable difference. You can find better ones in the grocery store, minus the carcinogens. Read up on it; using formaldehyde products will actually make your nails much worse in the long run!</li>
    <li> No different than clear nail polish</li>
    <li> This product really works. I ran out this bottle which is part of a three step process before running out the the other two steps. I was glad to see amazon sold this separately, because the other place I bought this from only sells the set together instead of separately.</li>
    <li> Nail tek intensive theraphy II was one of my favorite item for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I always used to use it for protecting my nails.&lt;br /&gt;It has been very effective for peeling nail.&lt;br /&gt;But! this product is a little bit different and weird.&lt;br /&gt;It takes longer time to dry than I used to use since&lt;br /&gt;last time. and it&#x27;s very sticky for a while after It&#x27;s dried. I&#x27;m not sure the reason.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I have used it several times.</li>
    <li> Great product highly recommend if you have brittle nails</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I was never ever able to grow my nails due to them always splitting or peeling. This product allowed me to grow them long and all at the same time. This is the first time in my life that I have ever had all my nails long and its been months. I would absolutely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Really helps my nails</li>
    <li> I have had soft and peeling nails for years, but a couple of weeks of using this product has allowed them to grow long - they look great.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this leaked &amp; I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the box as it was &amp;#34;glued&amp;#34; to the side of it.</li>
    <li> So far so good. No chilling my nails feel hard and only applied 1 coat.</li>
    <li> Despite using it at least 2-3 times a week nails still weak.&lt;br /&gt;.Will try the Nail tek III before truly panning product</li>
    <li> First strengthener and lengthener that I have use that has worked.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, my nails are still splitting.</li>
    <li> Really good tried buying it at a beauty supply store and it was not the same product it would not dry and did not do any good at all for my nails.  Had to order it online and it&#x27;s great.</li>
