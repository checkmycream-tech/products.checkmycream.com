<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Amazing product! My eyes  are now so clear...I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels in my eyes. Kinda refreshing! Other than that, I know it will take some time for me to see a difference so I will update and let you guys know. So far so good.</li>
    <li> This product is very helpful, and affordable. I put the drops in my eyes after mixing them with distilled water, and my eyes felt much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using the extract for 2 weeks now, no difference .</li>
    <li> Its in pure grain alcohol, i didnt notice that when i bought it, the taste is mostly of the alcohol which being pure grain tastes like garbage to me. My eyes felt less tired after a few days of taking it which is what its supposed to do, this didnt improve my vision but my vision is fine anyways.</li>
    <li> I am seeing improvement,you must stay constance ,I work with lots of chemicals,so I am taking Sinus plus and the eyebright formula along with lower bowel to remove the toxins.Remember herbs take time to heal to restore health instead of masking the problem.</li>
    <li> Used this as eyewash and took pills for six months according to instructions.&lt;br /&gt;My opthalmologist just told me that my cataracts have gotten worse.&lt;br /&gt;I completely wasted my time and money and still need surgery.&lt;br /&gt;Also, cayenne pepper is painful in eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Two stars because it is an effective (if painful) eye wash.</li>
    <li> Burns your eye. Totally ineffective. I eventually had a cataract operation</li>
    <li> I have used the dops for a year now and my vision is so much better&lt;br /&gt;it for sure clear the eyes...it burns when you put the drops in but&lt;br /&gt;it goes away....</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom who has been diagnosed with macular degeneration in both eyes and elevated presure in her left eye.  She had been applying brimonidine, 1 drop daily, in the left eye and lost the ability to see color in that eye.  Her vision also diminished in the 6 mos. of 1 drop daily.  She had many side effects from brimonidine.  After using Dr. Christopher&#x27;s, Nourish Herbal Eyebright Extract as an eyewash 3 times a day she got improvement in just 2 days!  She has continued experiencing improvement in vision as well as seeing colors again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is working her way up to 10 drops, 5 drops per eye cup, 3 times daily, and drinks the solution after she washes her  eyes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT as an eyewash, heat the distilled water until you see steam coming up from the water then add your drops, this will evaporate the alcohol from the solution.</li>
    <li> I have recently been (officially) diagnosed with glaucoma and mild cataract. I was searching for herbal remedy that could help decrease/stabilize my eye pressure and clear up the cataract when I found this. Since this is just a little bottle costing about $10, I gave it a shot. To my surprise, my eyesight became sharper in just two weeks after I started taking the drops orally (I am not doing the eye wash). I have been on it for a month now. Although my cataract still persists (worse in my right eye), I have noticed a decrease in the \\&quot;fogginess\\&quot; out of my right eye, and everything looks much sharper. I intend to keep using this product and will start doing the eye wash when I&#x27;m at home. I highly recommend this product - give it a shot, you have nothing to lose.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just been oral taking about 15 drops in my bottle of water once a day, and within a couple days my eyes were less dry and my vision slightly clearer.  I still am not sure if I&#x27;m imagining it, or what.</li>
    <li> I use this with an eyecup. Place about a teaspoon of water in the cup and then add ONE drop of the Eyebright and wash your eye. This is very powerful and should NOT be used undiluted. Trust me I tried. Don&#x27;t do it. But it is very refreshing if used diluted. I think it helps eye health.</li>
    <li> must use more often great product!</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product some several months back from my typical product i&#x27;ve been using for years. Honestly, I saw results within as little as a few days. The great thing about this product there are no adverse side affects, not the best tasting product but it truly does work. I don&#x27;t take it everyday and only once a day and my eyes are great and trust me i was squinting at everything before using this product. This is truly a great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for my father.  For the last couple years, he started to have eye problems.  Not seeing clear at night or vision just blurie for no reason.  Only one week of using this product, he says he can see better, he eyes doesn&#x27;t feel tired all the time like he used to.  Yesterday, I just purchased 2 more, one for my dad and one for my cousin.  Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> Although my instinct told me not to put cheyenne pepper in my eye. I thought I would try it anyway. It burned and left my eye red! I would not recommend this product for application to the eye, even as an eye wash. It may be effective if you are looking for an oral solution- but so far I notice to improvement in the moisture of my eye.</li>
    <li> I got my first eye floater about a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking an enzyme called serrapeptase hoping that would get rid of it.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It faded it, but it&#x27;s still there.&lt;br /&gt;Eyebright seems to be my final resort before just coming to terms that the floater will always be there.&lt;br /&gt;Getting old sucks.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I was really scared what the drops in my eyes would feel like.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a long time contact lens wearer so the action itself didn&#x27;t bother me, but would it sting?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so I took my first dose this evening October 21st, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;I only used two drops per eye cup and...I knew this whole thing would be trial and error.&lt;br /&gt;I did my right eye first and obviously didn&#x27;t get a good enough seal because water started dripping down my face.&lt;br /&gt;And my eye kept squeezing shut.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t burn but my eye did feel full, big...almost frozen in place if that makes any sense.&lt;br /&gt;I counted to about 30 seconds and really tried to move my eye around.&lt;br /&gt;I looked in the mirror and my eye was fire red which is normal so I know the solution got in there.&lt;br /&gt;The left eye was a lot easier. I got a better seal and the result was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second night was much easier but...I put the drops in luke warm water when the instructions clearly said to add simmering water to the drops.&lt;br /&gt;I read the label and sure enough there is grain alcohol in the drops.&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!!!&lt;br /&gt;Use simmering water as the alcohol provides a massive sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night three I actually followed the directions and the drops still stung but not as bad.&lt;br /&gt;Hot water will help burn off the alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;The main eye floater in my right eye appears to be breaking up but it&#x27;s too early to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;October 30, 2013, review update.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the eyebright drops for a week and notice the main floater in my right eye is a tad lighter.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but a little lighter is better than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice my eyes being any brighter or my vision improving but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 8, 2013, update.&lt;br /&gt;I started taking ten drops internally twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The eye wash itself is hit and miss with me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m doing it maybe four times a week. It&#x27;s just kind of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice something this morning, my main eye floater in my right eye has a clear spot right in the middle of it.&lt;br /&gt;Now my floater looks like a mini donut lol.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty cool, more updates later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 26th, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Final update.&lt;br /&gt;I upped the dose to 15 drops twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gone and I&#x27;m sad to report there was no further change in my eye floater.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this product is great for other eye issues like pink eye or cataracts so I have a hard time giving it a thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;For eye floaters...forget it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice my eyes being any brighter or my vision improving but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;November 8, 2013, update.&lt;br /&gt;I started taking ten drops internally twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;The eye wash itself is hit and miss with me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m doing it maybe four times a week. It&#x27;s just kind of a pain.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice something this morning, my main eye floater in my right eye has a clear spot right in the middle of it.&lt;br /&gt;Now my floater looks like a mini donut lol.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty cool, more updates later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 26th, 2013&lt;br /&gt;Final update.&lt;br /&gt;I upped the dose to 15 drops twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is gone and I&#x27;m sad to report there was no further change in my eye floater.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this product is great for other eye issues like pink eye or cataracts so I have a hard time giving it a thumbs down.&lt;br /&gt;For eye floaters...forget it.</li>
    <li> My eyesight has been slowly deteriorating so that I was using reading glasses and was just about to up the strength of the glasses when I bought this product.  I work a lot on computers and recently my eyes have started really hurting quite often.  I&#x27;ve only done the eyewash a few times since I seem to get it all over my face, but it cleared up the painful eyes immediately the first time and my eyes haven&#x27;t hurt since.  I started doing the tea instead 2-3xs a day and noticed a difference in just a few days which I thought was amazing.  I have been doing the tea off and on for about 5 weeks.  My eyesight is not perfect but I definitely don&#x27;t need stronger glasses now and often don&#x27;t need any reading glasses at all.  I will start with the eyewash again and see if that corrects everything.  I think this is a great product and it works fast.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this after video gaming for hours.  It help&#x27;s bring clarity back within minutes.  It has a slight burn but no real difference from putting in a medicated eye drop.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions for the eye wash, to a T. Burns like straight gasoline in the eyes. I cant use it, even super diluted. I know it has cayenne. ?? In the eyes though?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using the eyebright capsules and I do *think* i feel a little better but i&#x27;ll know more as time goes on.</li>
    <li> works very well...diluted with distilled water is gentler for first time users</li>
    <li> This did not work like I expected it too</li>
    <li> Although you can dilute this Herbal Eyebright Extract in hot water and wash your eyes with it, it is intended to be taken internally. I see many reviews of people dropping this product into their eyes, and the cayenne, which is an accelerator for certain herbs taken internally, will sting. I have mild cornea burns from being flashed by the reflectors of a solar oven, and thought to give this product a try. I began with the recommended dose, 10 drops in my tea or juice, 3x per day.  This dosage painfully intensified my symptoms, which told me that it did affect my eyes, so I backed off and started 5 drops per day, slowly building up to the recommended dose. Healing naturally is a slow process, but I can attest to the effectiveness of this Herbal Eyebright. I have noticed less pain and pressure and am hopeful that over time, I can see all of my symptoms relieved. Remember, Christophers Herbal Eyebright is not an eye drop, it is an herbal supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(-: By the way, these drops compliment ginger tea nicely :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gross and there aren&#x27;t directions so you aren&#x27;t sure wether to use as an eye drop or ingest it. Do NOT use as eye drops- I learned the painfully hard way- so I place a couple drops under my tongue- it tastes horrible and no effects as of yet</li>
    <li> After putting a few drops on my tongue there is no way I&#x27;m putting this in my eyes. More power to those that do. I know you dilute it blah blah blah..........I have been taking a dropper full in some berry juice every morning and after 3 weeks have got better results than just eyebright by itself especially if you add in a dropper full of Coleus Forskohlii. How I test this is by how well I see when I wake up in the morning. Before, I woke up not being able to read anything and no crust in the corner of my eyes. Now I wake up with clear vision and crust in the corners. The condition I have is interocular pressure which stops ocular fluid from flowing freely in and out the eye. The eye doctor gave me drops that made my eyes scratchy, irritated and red (like a druggy). Now my eyes are much more clear and feel better. Still have problems with too much computer usage.</li>
    <li> This product works great for pink eye. It has cayenne pepper in it, so it stings. Diluted a little with boiled distilled water, I used it on my granddaughter who had contracted conjunctivitis. She cried for less than a minute, &amp; because it hurt her I didn&#x27;t want to do it again, but just that one treatment took care of it. I have since used it on myself with excellent results.</li>
    <li> thanks for such a nice product this product works very well!</li>
    <li> It does sting but that just lets me know it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my eyesight, and found another purpose for it. I got pink eye, and used this, and it cleared it right up, after one episode of rinsing. I rinsed my eye several times in a row, 4-5 times. Pink eye....GONE! Now, if only I would remember to use it regularly for improvement to eyesight, I will report then intended purposes.</li>
    <li> Wow! I was really skeptical about this one because of my not-so-stellar results with herbal remedies in the past. But this one really works! I used the eyecup that other reviewers suggest and the two products work great together. On my first wash, I was really scared about the burning so I only put one drop. To my surprise, it actually felt really soothing with just one drop. Afterwards, I didn&#x27;t notice any significant increase in my eyesight. However, my eyes stopped hurting (after months of constant strain) for a few hours, and I was more than delighted to have been rid of that nasty eyestrain that has been giving me a headache for so long! After a few days of use, I have noticed that some halos that I used to see when looking at lights have disappeared (though the lights are still blurred). Everything, in general, seems sharper and I have noticed that my ability to focus images has gotten slightly better, since everything is sharp and all. For any curious readers, I usually put a couple drops into a cup of tea everyday. I wasn&#x27;t too sure what the instructions meant by \\&quot;tea,\\&quot; so I just made tea instead! In any case, I still do get occasional eyestrain but usually immediately after an eyewash with the formula it all goes away. So this has made my days a lot better and I am going to continue to use to get rid of that awful prickly, burning sensation typical of strained eyes for good!</li>
    <li> I got this drops for my second cousin, She&#x27;s about seven years old, She was having problems with her eyes to the point that She needs to wear glasses, I really didn&#x27;t ask what exactly is her problem, all I know that the swelling on the eyes went down according to the doctors and She&#x27;s doing Much better...</li>
    <li> Wow! What a difference in my eyesight!! I am extremely satisified with this product. I purchased it to be used as a preventative for macular degeneration and glaucoma as these diseases tend to run in our family. I had Lasik surgery a few years ago for high myopia but the surgery was not able to provide me with 20/20 vision. I still would require corrective lenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, within the past few months, my night vision began to deteriorate to the point where I couldn&#x27;t drive.  Then, my day vision began to deteriorate as well. After about 2 weeks of using this product as an eyewash 3 times a day, I saw an improvement in the clarity of my vision which in turn improved the distance. I don&#x27;t have 20/20 but overall, my vision has improved drastically. Thanks for an awesome product!</li>
    <li> shipping is super slow and the quality is so bad. It burns the eyes. My fathers eyesight got worse after use this product. I am so regret I bought this.</li>
    <li> Love this! Great product; has worked well on my dry eye. Will buy this product again. Thank you very much</li>
    <li> I am a 53 year old woman, in good health.  My eyes have not been &#x27;comfortable&#x27; for many years.  Dry, irritated, one infection, and i kept rubbing them.&lt;br /&gt;I finally got this product. I did try all the usual STOOPID dry eye drops, USELESS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i just started today, with clean water and a few drops. It felt SO GOOD, MY EYES HAVE NOT FELT THIS CLEAN AND CLEAR IN YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know alot about Eyebright because i&#x27;ve used herbs my entire life,,,,,but never got into the eye area before. Now, at this age,,,i have found a REAL BENEFICIAL product and i TRUST Dr. Christopher&#x27;s great knowledge.  I am excited to have this product.  For now,,,,i will just use it daily to get used to it....(of course i was scared,,,but the slight sting DOES go away,,,AND, i think it&#x27;s the alcohol that stings which means its like a disinfectant) but don&#x27;t be scared.  Right now, i just did it and I will probably use it forever.  Thank u Dr. Christopher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In ending,,i want to reiterate that my eyes feel like they just had a soothing massage and the WHOLE eye area feels RELAXED.....</li>
    <li> Taste terrible and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.  I am on my second bottle so maybe a wait and SEE attitude is better.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like to give one of Dr. Christopher&#x27;s product a negative feedback, but this product is really really burning your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;after reading the reviews I thought to give it a try. the instruction warn you of temporary burning , however the burning was just intolerable, in fact while closing my eye after that one drop I put I was wondering if there was a mistake and I have ordered the wrong item or that was not for the eye .&lt;br /&gt; I recommend the capsules for this same product, they are great and they did a great job for my eyes</li>
    <li> Ive used this product over the last 3 days according to the directions. After the initial emotional hurdle of willingly placing cayenne in my eyes, I now actually look forward to it. On day 1 my first attempt was with 1 drop and although I noticed a slight burn, it was hardly uncomfortable. The second use I upped the drops to 3 and even then it wasn&#x27;t bad. I noticed a big difference at 4 drops and have been content with 4 for the second and 3rd day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure whether this is a placebo effect, but 15-20 minutes after I am done with the wash, things do appear to be more crisp - especially things at longer distances. And my eyes don&#x27;t feel as tired or sore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to keep using it and increasing the drops to 5 when I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I will adjust my rating once this initial bottle is used, but for now i look forward to using it, and it makes my eyes feel less tired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I never finished the first bottle. After several weeks I noticed myself worrying this stuff might actually be making my eye site worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reduced the rating to 2 stars accordingly. It might work for some, but my instincts were to stop using it.</li>
    <li> It does sting when you use it, but anyone who has used an oc eye drop for allergies will be fine. I haven&#x27;t noticed the cayenne pepper, which I think is a good thing, because if you can smell it or taste it there&#x27;s probably too much in it. What you do notice when you smell it is the alcohol. I love the taste of it, but I&#x27;m strange like that. I use it as both a supplement and eye wash. I only use it as an eye wash when I&#x27;m having problems like dry, burning or itchy eyes. I do love the way my eyes feel after doing a wash clean and refreshed. It also feels like the skin is tightening up. It&#x27;s great! Only gave it 4 stars because I wish they&#x27;d just make it into an eye drop so you can use it while out. Just because I can&#x27;t remember if they&#x27;re listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Wildcrafted bayberry bark&lt;br /&gt;Organic Eyebright herb&lt;br /&gt;Wildcrafted goldenseal root&lt;br /&gt;Wildcrafted red raspberry leaf&lt;br /&gt;Cayenne pepper 40 MHU&lt;br /&gt;Base of 45% pure grain alcohol and distilled water</li>
    <li> I think this product works. I&#x27;ve been using it as an eye wash and have noticed my eyes look more clear. I have chronic itching in my right eye and noticed that this product seems most effective for relieving itch when taken orally so, I go back and forth between the eye wash and the drops.</li>
    <li> Received the extract in a timely manner.  While I thought I was ordering product with another doctor&#x27;s name on it, I am sure this will do just as well.</li>
    <li> I started using this product directly after detached retinal surgery. I&#x27;m well schooled in the use and effect of herbs so welcomed the slight stinging sensation that occurred with it&#x27;s use. It reduced swelling, prevented infection and sped healing. I refused the use of the steroids recommended by the surgeon.</li>
    <li> t kind of burns but seems to be helping a few stubborn styes on my eyelid. Too bad the Dr Christopher glass eye cup is a disappointment (poor fit and as a result leaky) I will look for something else to apply this product</li>
    <li> so many issues with my eyes my dr. had me on 4 different eye drops that did not help but made things worst due to side effects so I got this drops been using for 4 weeks now use 3 drops with eye wash yes it burns but the results that I got make me want to do it regardless. went to the eye dr. and  my distance and near and night vision improved, the dry eye issue is totally gone, light sensitivity is gone</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to try this product due to the poor handling of it.  75% of it had leaked out when I received it.  I hardly doubt if it could be replaced because if I return it, there&#x27;s nothing to return.  However, the seal is not broken, the lid was defective.  Turned out to be a waste of money but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably a great product.</li>
    <li> I would give it six stars if I could! This product has really helped me with my eyes that have been plagued with problems over the years.  My eyes were looking dingy and red all of the time. Now the whites look white and the white crescent that was forming around the outter edge of my iris is beginning to recede ( this is a sign of inflammation)&lt;br /&gt;The itcy feeling has also gone away! I take this product internally and as a eye wash per the manufactures instructions. Yes, it burns a bit when you use it, but so do do a lot of medications in dropper form that Doctors prescribe for the eyes. Give it a try (unless of course your worried about an allergic reaction) you will be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this off and on for years.  I find this very soothing to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a word of caution for those who haven&#x27;t tried it before, it is not meant to be used directly from the bottle into the eyes.  It&#x27;s much too strong!  You should put a couple of drops in an eye cup  filled with warm distilled or purified water and use it as an eye wash.  This formula contains cayenne pepper, which  stimulates the eye tissue and improves circulation in the eyes.  If you start out with 2 or 3 drops in an eye cup, you can build up a tolerance to the hot pepper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  have found it to be a wonderful relief to allergy  eye symptoms.  I can&#x27;t speak  for vision improvement, although my eye doctor said I have the  eyes of a healthy 25 year old.  I&#x27;m 73.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although  I see some of the reviews say they got rid of cataracts with this formula, I developed them while using this, I&#x27;m not sure if these  reviews are true..  I used NAC and Eyesight RX  to get rid of the cataracts.</li>
    <li> I had heard that the Dr. Christopher&#x27;s brand was sold and the products were not as good, but this is just as good as what I&#x27;ve been purchasing for many years. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this so I have no results so far. Hope it works. I have been using it several times a day along with the eyebright capsules.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a long time and really appreciate it. Nothing seems to clear my eyes as well as this.</li>
    <li> This item arrived on time in perfect condition.  Since I only received it a few days ago I have only used it three times.  I have been suffering from fall sinus issues and my eyes were tearing.  I used it as an eyewash with one drop the first time, because so many have mentioned the burning.  It actually burns less than the drops prescribed by my doctor to help with dry eyes.  Using an eyecup and following the directions, I immediately upped the dose to three drops.  Still not as unpleasant as my prescription drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now on to how my eyes feel.  They feel refreshed, clean and the mucus that I did not know was on my eyes washed out.  I cannot wait to see how my eyesight improves as I am also taking the drops internally (again the taste is not unpleasant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to purchase drops as needed from this seller.</li>
    <li> Great quality, great service!</li>
    <li> Dr. Christopher and his family not only make, but tell you how to make formulas, teas, etc. to keep yourselves healthy. I even use his products for my pets. I highly recommend all his formulas/capsules and books.</li>
    <li> I am so DISAPPOINTED in this product.  I will probably send it back.  It is supposed to be eyedrops....so I thought but you have to buy an eye cup and get distilled water, heat it up then put a few drops in and wash your eyes with it.  I feel I did not get what I expected.  Too much work!</li>
    <li> Four drops in distilled water in an eyecup (twice daily) have yielded significant reversal of cataract in about 2 weeks !</li>
    <li> I LOVE ALL OF DR. C&#x27;S PRODUCTS!...Quality Quality Quality...Not a bunch of marketing crap that is good at selling junk.  His products sell themselves and have continued to build the credibility OVER THE MANY years.  The names of the products have changed a couple of times (thanks to FDA regulations), however, the formulas are the same.  Gentle, trusted, and just nourishing!  My eyes have gotten clear, brighter and the whites are brighter just from a couple of days of using this.  I am also a student to the SNH and understand the foundations of these formulas.  Dr&#x27;C&#x27;s favorite herb is probably cayenne, but I NOW KNOW WHY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/26/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a year of using this product 1-2x/day 6 days/week (rest 1 day) and my eyes are much better condition.  I have updated this for anyone who may find it concerning that with using this eye wash and has pus looking mucus accumulation or eyes stuck together in the morning - PLEASE DON&#x27;T STOP using.  I mention so that one understands that this eye wash is cleansing and healing and DRAWING toxicity to the surface and out of the eye.  Over time, and cleansing this will stop and they eye will clear even more.  NOTE: This product contains cayenne and yes it burns (only initially) but it becomes sadistically soothing after a while.  Cayenne brings circulation to the eye and is very beneficial.</li>
    <li> The real deal!!  Great product!</li>
    <li> makes my eyes feel clearer and brighter</li>
    <li> All natural and has helped with the redness and broken veins in my eyes from being on the computer to long. I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> I tried for about a week - it burned as they said it would and I could live with that - but didn&#x27;t do much else except make my eyes red.</li>
    <li> I will be honest, I don&#x27;t follow the instructions with use for the recommended 3 times a day. However, after using this my eyes feel very fresh, vision is noticeably clearer, and it helps to expel mucus from my eyes. Will continue to use and keep around my house. Eyes are whiter and brighter after use, if only I could commit to the 3 times daily I would have perfect eyes!</li>
    <li> great product. improved my night vision</li>
    <li> made my eyes redder diluting w water didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ll use as mouth wash yuck hate wasting money</li>
    <li> I think my vision is clearing up.  It refreshes my eyes after staring at the computer screen for a few hours.</li>
    <li> This formula is strong and so far it works for the purpose I am using it for (eye wash).</li>
    <li> I think the product is good, my only pause is that it has cayenne in it which makes a woman of my age have more hot flashes so I think I will not use it for a while.</li>
    <li> For years I managed a health food store.  During that time, I experimented and found a cure for cataracts using Dr. Christopher&#x27;s eyebright formula.  I simply put 4-5 drops of the formula into a half full 1 oz. dropper bottle of boiling distilled water.  After cooling, I&#x27;d shake it up and flush my eyes every morning and evening.  The cataracts were gone in two months.  I made a fresh batch once a week.  A doctor confirmed that I had cataracts and confirmed that they were completely gone after the two month treatment.  The longest it took anyone to dissolve the cataracts was five months and that individual had well developed cataracts.</li>
    <li> Fast accurate shipping. It was everything I hoped for.</li>
    <li> I do not suffer from any eye conditions, however I do work in front of a computer for many hours.  By the end of the day my eyes are tired and red, and my vision is a little blurry.  Dr. Christopher&#x27;s Herbal Eyebright Extract has already improved the clarity of my vision and my eyes&#x27; appearance.  After 3 days of use 3-4 times each day my eyes are white and feel great!  Truly, I haven&#x27;t had pure white whites in my eyes for at least 5 years.  I am thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use of this formula my eyes did feel very clean.  My vision was even crisper and brighter than usual.  Although I didn&#x27;t do any medical eye tests, I am certain that the clarity with which I could read was improved.  The text on my computer screen was noticeably sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are suffering from any forms of eye problems - including failing vision, cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration, retinopathy or night blindness... or just want cleaner, fresher, healthier eyes - I highly recommend this eye wash formula. It is far more than a washing cleanser - it helps to rejuvenate and heal the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found a great glass eye wash cup that I use: [[ASIN:B0016B9YPO Eye Wash Cup 1 Count]]. The shape of this eye cup is ideal - better than the other glass eye cups that I have tried.  The hourglass shapes gives your fingers a sturdy place to grip.  The size of the cup opening fits my eye perfectly.  And the glass is textured for a better grip. I highly recommend using glass over plastic whenever possible.  There are far too many studies showing the toxins in plastics that are absorbed in our foods and water.</li>
    <li> I love this herbal formula!&lt;br /&gt;I am using 1/2 strength to start, and it only burns a little.&lt;br /&gt;I could notice a difference right away, with my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I have bletheritis, and have felt like there was sand in my eyes for a long while.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that after only 2 nights of use, my eyes have felt normal again.&lt;br /&gt;After mixing the formula in a cup of boiling water, and letting it cool for use&lt;br /&gt;in my eyes, I drink the remainder.  I have high hopes that soon all symptoms&lt;br /&gt;will be gone...I highly recommend this formula.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not often that I find a product that I am 100% satisfied with and fulfills all it claims.  I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff and will make sure to keep it on hand.</li>
    <li> my eyes feel really good after using this.  start out with a few drops just to see if it burns.  it took about 15 drops in a cup of water to make the tea before i began to feel a tingle. now i am using more per cup.</li>
    <li> I threw the product away because the instruction on it was not clear to follow</li>
    <li> READ THE INSTRUCTIONS !!!  I didn&#x27;t. I put this extract CONTAINING CAYENNE directly into my eyes.  Dillute it, use the dillute solution as an eye wash; that way it works effectively.  I have not used this as a dietary supplement.</li>
    <li> As the reviews I read before I bought it state&amp;#34;this stuff works great&amp;#34;.  More like eye medicine than regular eye drops...  stings a little for a minute.  But it works great, cheaper that the drugstore variety, does not take much.  Helped with my dry eyes.  Could not be happier with the product!</li>
    <li> No changes and the bottle is half already.</li>
    <li> i really love this product. i love how clear my eyes have become and no more irritation even when i wear my contacts.</li>
    <li> just received  it 2 day ago to early to rate, but I have high hopes</li>
    <li> I have to continue using it but it has helped lighten up my double vision from a brain injury in a week when I used it for a week straight . I stopped i got lazy i still have some left and use it once in a while i still have some double vision . this makes my eye look bubbly and moist and not dry and thirsty. i like it</li>
    <li> My 84 year old grandma can really see better.  She had cataract.  This stuff is slowly melting them.  It does burn your eyes.  But it is worth it.!!!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews carefully before I made my purchase. Glaucoma runs in my family and then I got a really annoying eye floater and was a bit concerned. I don&#x27;t want to use eye drops for the rest of my life from the ophthalmologist, so I was looking for an alternative. I understand it doesn&#x27;t work for everybody the same way. My results have been on a lower key, but I did notice a slight improvement. There are times when I&#x27;ll realize I am seeing completely clearly without my glasses. So, I think I will continue to use this and see if things get progressively better. I will be going back to the eye Dr. soon and am curious to see what their tests indicate. Will update with results later.</li>
    <li> bought this for a friend I will update as soon as I have information.</li>
    <li> Been using this as eyedrops with distilled water and manuka honey. My eyes are much clearer. Trying to hold off cataracts. A little sting but it feels good. I&#x27;ll keep up with it.</li>
    <li> I doubt this product does any real harm, but I noticed that my vision became more blurry.  I know it did not help at all.  I did experience some burning when applied, but it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> Want to go blind? Use this!&lt;br /&gt;For God&#x27;s sake it has alcohol and cayenne pepper in it!</li>
    <li> this product burns---I used it in the most diluted strength, too.  Maybe I should have tried it for more than 3 days but I was truly afraid it might irritate, even damage my eyes.</li>
    <li> The use of this product as eyewash is soothing to the eyes. Also taking this procuct orally helps with nasal congestion.</li>
    <li> This is some excellent product... the eye wash part, takes some getting used to... but, the product works very well...</li>
    <li> I like Eyebright. It&#x27;s somewhat addicting once you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried it, I put four drops, as directed, in a glass eye cup. I could barely apply it. It burned so bad. However, I was persistent. I used basic yoga techniques of breathing through the pain, and I eventually got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about two weeks, the burning was almost non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only change I noticed, after one week of use, is that my eyes aren&#x27;t as bothered by allergens as much. For me, this is a big improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is no miracle worker, but it does help.</li>
    <li> The drops taste weird and very bitter.  Kinda leary of putting it directly in my eyes....  Would be nice if they included an eyewash cup for that purpose.</li>
    <li> you need a eye cup which I don&#x27;t have.&lt;br /&gt;I totally don&#x27;t like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy an eye cup at some point.&lt;br /&gt;This product remains in my medicine unused.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I buy Dr Christopher&#x27;s line often. Don&#x27;t have dry eyes and the first day I used it my eyes felt great, like it needed the cleaning. Now I don&#x27;t wake up with morning muck that I have to blink away : )</li>
    <li> This product is terrible, and a waste of money, plus, it makes your eyes worse rather than better. The directions were followed exactly, so that was not the problem.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say i see a change in my eyes they are brighter and whiter and i love it</li>
    <li> From all the reviews, it is a good product but whomever applied the inventory control label (bar code) to the bottle applied it directly over the manufacturer&#x27;s directions for using the product.  When trying to remove the bar coded label, it destroys the manufacturer&#x27;s label.  However, I read a recent  review of this product in that the reviewer says he/she applied four drops directly to the eye and it burned fiercely.  Yes, I would agree with that because even though removing the bar code label from the bottle destroyed the manufacturer&#x27;s directions for use of the product, the warning label warns that this product contains \\&quot;cayenne\\&quot; and an appropriate warning when putting it in your eyes.  Cayenne will create more than simply a severe burning sensation I think!  No amount of yoga can help you with that!</li>
    <li> I purchased to help me strengthen my eyes as I work on restoring my vision with some exercises form the Bates method.</li>
    <li> Eyes felt better inside one day.  Internal use only but directions give formula for eyewash but not needed for me.  I take A LOT of supplements to maintain most excellent health, so want to advise that this product may be working IN CONJUNCTION with other supplements.  So tricky to figure exactly what works but CAN tell right away when improvement occurs.</li>
    <li> My mom has ordered this from New York and have used for years so I found it here for a much better price. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  I tried it both orally and in the eye.  I did not see any improvement.  It is also slightly painful to put in the eye, and a lot of work to keep up with the regimen they suggest.  I used it for a few months with no improvement.  I usually don&#x27;t buy meds with no scientific basis, but I thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.  I hope others have more success with it than I did, but my guess would be that most of the glowing reviews you read around the internet for this are fake.</li>
    <li> This is also very good my dad been using it every since its came and i likes it alot thanks</li>
    <li> This is what I want, it is recommended.</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference and it definitely helps with my itchy eye symptoms lately. There is a sting but that goes away quickly. The directions are clear and easy to follow. Glad I bought this one and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> this product has helped my eyes but if a person has serious eye problems please ask your doctor.herbs to keep eyes healthy is why i bought it and i like it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product, but I did not determine if I was getting any results.</li>
    <li> Great for eyes but burns like the dickens. Thank You</li>
    <li> I should have known better .... product doesn&#x27;t work AND the seal was broken when I received it.  Leakage in the mailing envelope.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product along with another herb to try to eliminate a cataract without surgery. It&#x27;s going to be a long process so I can&#x27;t  really rate the product justly right now. However, I have noticed that it brightens up the white of your eye. It stings on the first contact because of the cayenne but after that it&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;ll report back at a later date.</li>
    <li> Aging eyes are not as bright, white without this product. Daily use (10 drops added to juice) slowly restored a brighter, more youthful appearance that no other product provided.</li>
    <li> An Iridologist recommended this product for my small cataracts.&lt;br /&gt;A second photo of my eye showed they have gotten smaller.&lt;br /&gt;I Use it as an eye wash &amp; also drink a solution of it every day.&lt;br /&gt;Directions are on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Experienced immediate relief from redness &amp; swelling when used as a diluted eyewash!!! Thank you for this natural remedy. Truly amazing!</li>
    <li> This is stuff is wonderful. I will reorder and probably use the rest of my life. Has eliminated the need for expensive prescriptions. only need to use once a day now.  I have even got my son using. WE both have bad allergy eyes. A total must have!</li>
    <li> too spicy for my eyes</li>
    <li> Burned my eyes and my throat.  I also seemed to end up with a stuffy nose each time I used it.  I am not typically allergic to things so I was surprised by my response.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my friend. She is very happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> It may have worked but I didn&#x27;t use it because it tasted horrible. And it wasn&#x27;t leaking when it arrived, so I may have just been bad from being half open or something.</li>
    <li> I noticed an improvement within days of starting to use it. It does burn my eyes a little bit and makes my eyes water.</li>
    <li> The is the greatest thing. It does work. Yes it burns but it works. You must follow the directions. It will take a few treatments before you SEE a difference. But remember to follow the directions. Remember it takes a few treatments before you notice anything. Again it does burn but the more you do the less the burning.  Soon you don&#x27;t feel a thing.</li>
    <li> This product was the most surprising thing I stumbled across, by complete accident. It hearkens back to the 1800&#x27;s pharmacist mixing tonic and salves, but by gosh It Works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eye specialist told me my swollen eyes had a viral infection, allergies, AND a bacterial infection. Furthermore, all three were preventing each other from getting better with various prescriptions so I was just stuck with it for life. I had become used to my dry, puffy and itchy eyes, but they were a constant source of misery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this stuff, I found by complete accident while searching for something else on Amazon. For Ten Bucks, why not? In just 1 week&#x27;s time of using morning and night daily, my eyes are in such better shape. You are instructed to put 1 to 5 drops in an eye cup with Purified water, and blink, look around for several seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are not red, puffy or itchy from dryness anymore. My eyes used to look like &amp;#34;John&amp;#34; from Garfield, you know the big bug eyes? I have an old fashioned glass eye cup which makes the process easy and sanitary. Be advised one of the main ingredient is Cayenne Pepper! Yes, really, and it does burn for a moment, but you blink through it and will feel so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side bonus, my eyes which are normally a &amp;#34;steel blue&amp;#34; are now a much brighter shade of blue, more like turquoise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your eyes hurt and doctors have you using a bunch of strong medicine with potential side effects, try this! Sometimes the oldest tricks are still the best tricks!</li>
    <li> i USED THIS PRODUCT 1 TIME IN MY BAD EYE AND IT BURNED LIKE HELL. iT ALSO MADE WHAT LITTLE EYESIGHT&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE IN THAT EYE BLURRED FOR SEVERAL HOURS. I DUMPED IT DOWN THE TOILET.</li>
    <li> Great product, great delivery time too!</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase. I can&#x27;t say that it works but I like it anyways. I&#x27;d like to think that as time goes on its helping me in some way. I don&#x27;t mind the taste either.</li>
    <li> I must say it STINGS LIKE HELL lol.. But it works awesome I just need to figure out how to measure the drops right.. lol I told my friend it felt great and gave her a drop and literally SCREAMED lol that was to funny.. the next morning she called and begged for more.. This is a great product and I will order more...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, red eyes for about 10 years now. Nothing seems to help. I&#x27;ve been to an opthamologist &amp; optometrist, tried many different eye drops, compresses, and lots of other remedies... nothing has ever worked. The whites of my eyes also get kinda \\&quot;dingy\\&quot; looking... the whites just aren&#x27;t very bright. People comment on it often and it&#x27;s always bothered me. I just heard of this product and ordered it a couple weeks ago. It has made a big difference! And I don&#x27;t even use it everyday. I take it orally and as an eye wash. My eyes are so much brighter and clearer. I still have some red but it has really improved. I will continue to use it and hopefully my eyes will clear up completely. This stuff has worked so much better than anything my doctors have ever prescribed or suggested. It does sting when you use it as an eye wash, but you can reduce the dosage and its not as bad. The burning &amp; redness go away quickly... leaving brighter eyes almost immediately. I believe this is exactly what I&#x27;ve been needing and I feel much more confident about the way my eyes look. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> I chose to dilute the extract and wash my eyes in it. I put only 2 drops (label says 1-5) into a small eyecup of filtered water once a day. My eyes felt much better, the itching gone from blepharitis. I had hoped to continue to treat cataract development, but my eyelids developed a red inflamed rash. I think the cayenne burned my sensitive eyelid skin. I stopped using it and the itchy rash went away with applying hydrodortisone cream for 3 days. No google search mentions how the cayenne content can burn skin with direct contact.&lt;br /&gt;I also did not receive the item within the stated time. It arrived after another week.I shall try more diluted and also try taking internally but weaker than suggested on label. Be careful!</li>
    <li> Burns like hell, no fun at all. But it got rid of a minor eye infection that was not cured by antibiotic eye drops. Imagine putting hot pepper into a wound, now think of that feeling in the eye. It worked for me however.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s been using it not as eyewash but as a dietary supplement for the past three weeks and she noted improvement in her allergies in the first week. It relieved her itchy and watery eyes better than anything else she has ever tried. She hasn&#x27;t complained about her eyes since the first week. We came across this formula by searching the net for natural ways to fight allergies and it paid off in a big way. We bought the eyewash cups so she can try it as an eyewash when it comes in the mail but as a supplement it worked wonders for her.</li>
    <li> WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE! I have had red, itchy, watery yet dry eyes for years. Have spent so much time and money on allergists, eye doctors, acupuncture, compresses, vitamins, etc to get rid of the bloodshot, itchy, dingy look to my eyes. Within three days this marvelous tincture gave me tremendous relief and within two weeks, I am cured. With zero side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions. I put drops in my tea 3 times a day and do an eye wash in morning and at night. Approximately 5-6 drops in eye cup per eye (plus pinch of salt). Does not sting badly for me and I do not mind the taste in my tea. Intend to use this indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day or two, I had total relief from discomfort but even redder eyes. But with consistent use, within a week there was significant relief from all symptoms. Be patient. It is a wonderful product. Hope it helps you too.</li>
    <li> very good product... highly recommend...I use as eyedrops... after a couple seconds of slight burning in the eyes... eyes feel great .... works great on tired eyes... I see no downside In using them to promote eye heath.. as for It contains many herbs vital to heathy eyes...</li>
    <li> After purchasing this item I read some reviews and found that the product is not proven and possibly not even safe. I still have the bottle but have never used it. Better safe than sorry.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t good to run out of this. I have replaced using my expensive eye drops for using these as an eye wash . It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t just help the symptom, it heals .</li>
    <li> really good stuff...HOT but makes my eyes feel more refreshed</li>
    <li> Since starting to take this herbal tincture I have not noticed any difference at all in my eyesight, nor in my dry eyes. I can&#x27;t bring myself to do the eye wash as this has cayenne pepper in it, &amp; I&#x27;m allergic to it topically.</li>
    <li> I have been having problem with my eyes. In someone told me to order this in I did.  If you anger over the taste of the drop.  But it works.</li>
    <li> I have always had sensitive and irritable eyes. I bought this to use as an eye wash fully aware of all the warnings that it does sting or burn to a degree. I have used it nine times so far (I use about once a week) and it makes my eyes feel AMAZING! I will confess that it does burn a bit, but I have noticed a decrease in that sensation with each use. I love the way it makes my eyes feel like they&#x27;ve been thoroughly cleaned. I love it.</li>
    <li> This eye drop product contains pepper. I do not want to put it in my eyes. Hoping to get my money back.</li>
    <li> my eyes are in perfect condition but i just wanted to whiten them the eye wash is impossible to do so i had to just drink it and i noticed no results in whitening my sclera</li>
    <li> I use this product but more interestingly I use it on my dog that has a tumor,terminal cancer. I wipe her eyes with a clean clothe soaked in eyebright and water and also put it in her drinking water. It has help her a great deal and I have benefited from it&#x27;s use as well.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised at how well this works, especially compared to off the shelf eye products. Can be used as eye drops also, you do have to &#x27;prepare&#x27; it yourself if using as drops. Simple instructions for that included.</li>
    <li> You can take this internally or use as a wash for your eyes.  It has peppers in it so at first you would think the idea is nuts.  I must say it&#x27;s not the most comfortable sensation....but it really makes your eye sight better with in minutes.  After the burning sensation which goes away quick.  I continued to use it and lumps in my eyes have disappeared and the other one reduced in size.  I am going to start using it again and hope to stick with it long enough this time to improve my vision.  I don&#x27;t tell you that it stings to discourage you, but rather to let you know that is what is supposed to happen and it&#x27;s short lived.....and well worth the gain.  You will want to find a glass eye wash cup....</li>
    <li> I bought this tincture in hopes of helping my 47 year old eyes stop the aging process after the eye doctor told me the inevitable was going to happen....bifocals.  Well I had been using it for a few months went in for my one year check up and the doctor said I did not need bifocals and that one eye had actually improved on distance and the other on close up reading.  I cannot say for sure that herbal eyebright is the only reason that happened but I can say I am pleasantly surprised and going to stick with the tincture for years to come.</li>
    <li> This product has helped with chronic dry eyes.  Eventhough I don&#x27;t do the wash, I have soaked my eyes with the dropplet, and I can feel my eyes breath again.  It has also helped to take the tired looking way my eyes look, and makes them brighter.  What I have done is take another bottle with distilled warm water and put 5 drops in the bottle, shake well, and soak my eyes by letting the drops cover the eye.  It does sting for a minute, but feels better aftewards.  I wish it could take away the floater and flashers, but I don&#x27;t think it works for that.</li>
    <li> Can someone please let me know if it is normal if it BURNS your eye? Like you feel like its burining so bad you cant open your eye and when i do is like nlood-red</li>
    <li> I had dry eyes for years I&#x27;ve tried many other OTC and prescriptions with little results, after using this product for about 2 months dry eyes are a thing of a past for me. I started by doing the eye-washes, but now I mostly mix it with tea and consume it like that. It has also made my eyes look more clear and my vision is also more clear. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After using several days so far, my eyes feel a lot better, after much computer eye strain!</li>
    <li> i just started using it for the last 2 days. I did feel a small tingling for 5 drops..so I use 3-4 drops. My eyes feel clean for now..I havent seen a real effect on clearness of vision or eye brightness. Will post another review after 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> This little bottle was placed in a box much too large with a couple of packing pillows/cushions.  When I opened the box I discovered the contents had spilled during shipping. It was a mess.  Happily I was credited for the purchase</li>
    <li> Healed my dry eye syndrome completely. 4-5 drops in eye wash 2x a day and my eyes slowly went back to normal. I would highly recomend this</li>
    <li> My husband is using this extract to help with his cataracts &amp; it seems to be working. He is using it in conjunction with Dr. Christopher&#x27;s eyebright capsules</li>
    <li> Ive been taking this supplement 2-3 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some months of using it I went to my eye doctor for a check up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are STABLE!! Every year my eyesight gets worse, well NOT this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy and I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I been bothered by dry, gritty, burning eyes for years and nothing help (even prescription drops) but this has helped tremendously, the stinging when first used is to be expected because of the cayenne but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for this natural product. The ony thing negative I can say is it does not come with an eye wash cup, but I still love it.</li>
    <li> Use this every morning. Makes my eyes feel clean, stimulated and clear.</li>
    <li> use it every day.  my eyes are much happier!! thanks, Dr. C!</li>
    <li> I have been using this eyebright extract for a few weeks in combination with other treatments for redness and dry eye.  I think it is helping on all counts and I will continue to use it.  I have not experienced burning or any other issues with 5 drops in my eye wash cup.</li>
    <li> On effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My vision itself has not improved, but my eyes don&#x27;t hurt (even after looking at a computer for hours) and they&#x27;re prettier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But true story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no words for how bad this stuff tastes - and I&#x27;m someone who will put up with anything if it benefits my health.  I *dread* this part of my day (because I don&#x27;t have any vessels suitable for an eyewash).  This stuff is what happens when trees throw up peppery mulch and cancer.  I hold my nose through the entire ordeal, then swallow a gallon of chocolate milk before I even consider letting my nose go.  My boyfriend thinks it&#x27;s hilarious though, so if you&#x27;re dead set on taking it in your mouth, have a video camera on hand.</li>
    <li> Surprised by very good performance, like it</li>
    <li> This liquid leaked a tiny bit, but was so well wrapped that nothing else was damaged.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t recommend it burn my eye like hill its like you put a hot chille pepper into your eyes.</li>
    <li> I mix 10 drops in orange juice and drink quickly. Tastes horrible in water and the OJ makes it bearable. Only on my 5th day and can focus better and read street signs alot further then before. For $10 it was a no brainer to me if it worked awesome; if not its only $10. Well ended up being worth the risk and Best $10 I&#x60;ve ever spent.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much improvement.I am still using.</li>
    <li> I like this, but the first time I used it, I was going to use it straight from the bottle! -- so glad I read the instructions -- you MUST dilute this!  Even so, I used it at a higher-than-recommended strength and it was just too much.  My eyes actually felt irritated after.  So I&#x27;ll never do that again.  I now use about 3 drops in about an eighth-to-a-quarter cup (I don&#x27;t actually measure the water -- and I don&#x27;t use tap, I use a water that I drink, Arrowhead) and I rinse the whole eye in that small glass cup.  I think it works well at clearing up the eyes, but I don&#x27;t find it as SOOTHING as another product I&#x27;ve tried, such as Eyebright from Wisdom of the Ages, which uses a totally different formula.  (That one doesn&#x27;t require dilution.)  Still, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Just remember:  DILUTE first!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product,I believe it is working for me.Just give it some more time,will continue to use rhis product.</li>
    <li> Tried it as an herbal eye wash and didn&#x27;t find it helpful. The sensation was refreshing but find it most helpful to ingest about 20 drops 2 times a day when my eyes are extra irritated usually from the weather or dry conditions.</li>
    <li> My eyes are perpetually itchy, especially during allergy season.  This stuff works really well.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
    <li> this is great product that works. thanks</li>
    <li> Recieved this product today and the company that it comes from applies there company label over the directions ... when you attempt to peel it off ... you take the directions off with it... suggestions dont put your company label or packing label across the directions PLEASE!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product .. definitely helpful to the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware: it contains cayenne .. YES! like the hot power in your spice cabinet..same stuff! Please follow the directions for diluting the drops of eyebright into sterile water (boiled, cooled to hot, add drops, let continue to cool to a comfortable temperature so you don&#x27;t burn your eyeballs!) You will still know it when the drops go in your eyes, but not to worry, just close your lids and the initial sensation caused by the cayenne will go away quickly&lt;br /&gt;The cayenne stimulates blood flow to your eyes, and that will help nourish your eyes and hopefully you&#x27;ll soon notice improved vision!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my personal after thought: you might want to find you a small stainless steel pan or cup in which to heat the water. Use it ONLY for this purpose so there will be no foreign matter or grease residue on the cup.to contaminate your eyedrops. Just a thought...</li>
    <li> I would love it IF I could handle it.  10 drops 3 X a day is too much, could not get past the first drop it burns too long, felt like cayenne pepper was too much in the bottle.  Really wish I could do this, but with that much of a burn, no.  I could handle 1 burning drop 3 a day not 30 in each eye. I really wanted to like it.</li>
    <li> I took it for about a week or two, and I didn&#x27;t notice many effects. Good in theory, bad in practice.</li>
</ol>
