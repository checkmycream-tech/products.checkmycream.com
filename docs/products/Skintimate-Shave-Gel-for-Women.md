### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy to see that Amazon carries Skintimate shave cream</li>
      <li>Great value</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
      <li>It is earning 2 stars based solely on the pleasant fragrance and NOT on the merits (or lack thereof) of its moisturizing capabilities.</li>
      <li>I loved Skintimate cream shave.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>I am so glad I could buy some on Amazon!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for moisturizing but also good for someone with sensitive legs that sometime get irritated by shaving.  </li>
      <li>This shave cream is really nice.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, a nice smell should be a given.</li>
      <li>Then you squeeze and the cream comes out in a nice even stream.</li>
      <li>This goes on smoothly, protects skin from the razor fabulously, washes off easily, leaves skin feeling smooth, and smells great to boot!  </li>
      <li>so I will be able to purchase it in future.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Buying a 6 pack on here is most assuredly one of the cheapest ways of purchasing this item.</li>
      <li>I love this shave cream.  </li>
      <li>As some reviewers mentioned, it does tend to clog on the razor so you do have to rinse your razor more thoroughly and more often</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more creamy and oily, so it does feel quite luxurious on your skin and it does an okay job of soaking in for smoother skin.</li>
      <li>My skin didn&#x27;t feel or look more moisturized after using this product.   </li>
      <li>My favorite shaving cream.</li>
      <li>I think rubbing my legs with sandpaper may have been more soothing than the razor burn that occurred.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite shaving cream, and I can no longer find it anywhere at the store.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>My shave wasn&#x27;t noticeably better.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive skin, and this does the job perfectly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and gets a closer, cleaner shave.</li>
      <li>It is non foaming and more like a lotion that leaves your skin nice and smooth for the razor to pass over and also leaves the skin nice and smooth (instead of dry and rubbery) after rinsing off.</li>
      <li>Side note ladies, if you want the smoothest legs of your life, try exfoliating, then smooth on this stuff and let it sink in for a minute or so, then shave.</li>
      <li>It does not rinse as cleanly as the gel products.  </li>
      <li>The one redeeming characteristic of this shave cream is that it smells nice</li>
      <li>You squeeze a little and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
      <li>Once I figured it out, I realized it was pretty easy.</li>
      <li>Yes the pull top is a bit of a pain to use and it does take forever to rinse out of your razor blade,  but if you can look past those two minor flaws, it&#x27;s a great product performance wise, it does what it says.</li>
      <li>lasts longer, either way i still have really dry skin and get razor burn, but I felt this was a better value and more travel friendly than the cans.</li>
      <li>I expected to just be able to use it in the shower with ease and to have better moisturized skin.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s  a small price to pay for a great shave.</li>
      <li>I like this so much better then regular shave gel</li>
      <li>My skin is noticeably softer and more moisturized compared to regular shaving creams or gels.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find Skintimate shaving lotion at my local stores any longer.  </li>
      <li>It does clog up the razor more quickly than gel leaving you to rinse your razor more frequently, but that is a small inconvenience.</li>
      <li>, I think it&#x27;s worth what you pay, and you get a decently close shave.  </li>
      <li>and it stays clean during travel, no mess or anything.</li>
      <li>Yes, it is a different feel than shave gel, but it works just fine and doesn&#x27;t leave the shower rusty.</li>
      <li>Neither of which was accomplished with this product.</li>
      <li>, I get a much closer, cleaner shave, but don&#x27;t knick my legs or get razor burn anymore</li>
      <li>It gets stuck in the razor and doesn&#x27;t come off in the water very well.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product for the two reasons mentioned in the title of this review.  </li>
      <li>I find that it works better than the other shave gels that are available in the big box retailers, but not as well as some of the high-end mens items.  </li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s more difficult to work into a lather compared to the gel products, so you will need to use more.</li>
      <li>sum up, I highly recommend this shaving product if you are looking for one that works and will not leave the shower rusty.</li>
      <li>(I am a bit more sensitive to fragrances than the average person)</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving</li>
      <li>:) I always had trouble buying shaving cream until I discovered this one!</li>
      <li>Smooth shaving with much less skin irritation.  </li>
      <li>My legs are silky smooth and actually feel slippery while they&#x27;re still wet.</li>
      <li>As far as moisturizing?  </li>
      <li>Who wants rust rings left in the shower from where the can sits?</li>
      <li>Not only does it help with the shave but leaves your skin very moisturized</li>
      <li>so it lasts for  a pretty long time.</li>
      <li>but this is the only one that seems to really moisturize.</li>
      <li>I started trying different shaving creams/lotions (A LOT of them) after I suddenly developed an allergy to my normal shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>I will never go back to normal gel or cream.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite shaving cream and is hard to find in stores anymore!</li>
      <li>My legs aren&#x27;t dry anymore either, they&#x27;re much much softer looking/feeling</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the major foaming ones (skintimate, barbasol, you name it.</li>
      <li>I get VERY dry skin that would not stop itching in the winter no matter how much lotion I slathered on, and every time I shaved</li>
      <li>I use about a green olives worth for my entire leg, bikini area to toes.</li>

<li> Takes half a bottle to shave one time.</li>
<li> I have read that some other users have complained about this &amp;#34;gunking up&amp;#34; their razors, and while that may seem to be the issue, I usually end up rinsing mine multiple times during a shave anyways, so it does not bother me.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t like to waste</li>
<li> a few years ago I decided to give it a try.</li>
<li> The container looks small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot</li>
<li> I am not sure what I will ever do if they stop making this stuff.</li>

<li> This year Walmart has taken it off its shelves which was disappointing.</li>

    <li> As someone who suffers from incredibly dry skin during the cold autumn and winter months, I was looking for a product that would offer some relief after shaving.  I thought the \\&quot;cream\\&quot; base would offer that protective moisturizing barrier between razor and skin.  Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that this product is little more than a thin lotion.  It layers on so thinly that it becomes incrementally more wasteful than using the shaving gel from which I had just switched, since I had to layer it on so thickly.  And, ironically - even though the lotion itself is thin, it tends to clog the razor as it builds up between the blades.  It does not rinse as cleanly as the gel products.  As far as moisturizing?  I think rubbing my legs with sandpaper may have been more soothing than the razor burn that occurred.  It is earning 2 stars based solely on the pleasant fragrance and NOT on the merits (or lack thereof) of its moisturizing capabilities.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shaving creams, but none have been as bad at this one. It gets stuck in the razor and doesn&#x27;t come off in the water very well. I could only shave two or three times with the razor before having to throw it out because the cream is stuck in my razor.</li>
    <li> I have always been upset that no company had come out with a shaving product container that could be left in the shower without rusting. Who wants rust rings left in the shower from where the can sits? Traditional shave gel container rust after one shower unless you take it out and dry and and store it somewhere else after each use, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this at Walmart a few years ago I decided to give it a try. I loved Skintimate cream shave. Yes, it is a different feel than shave gel, but it works just fine and doesn&#x27;t leave the shower rusty. This year Walmart has taken it off its shelves which was disappointing. I tried another brand called EOS which is so heavily scented it bothers my nose. (I am a bit more sensitive to fragrances than the average person) I am happy to see that Amazon carries Skintimate shave cream so I will be able to purchase it in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up, I highly recommend this shaving product if you are looking for one that works and will not leave the shower rusty. It does clog up the razor more quickly than gel leaving you to rinse your razor more frequently, but that is a small inconvenience.</li>
    <li> This shave \\&quot;cream\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t lather, but instead goes on like a body wash. It is easy to use and gets a closer, cleaner shave. My skin is noticeably softer and more moisturized compared to regular shaving creams or gels. I won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Great value and it doesn&#x27;t rust! and it stays clean during travel, no mess or anything.</li>
    <li> lasts longer, either way i still have really dry skin and get razor burn, but I felt this was a better value and more travel friendly than the cans.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product for the two reasons mentioned in the title of this review.  Bad Packaging: When you&#x27;re in the shower trying to use this product, it&#x27;s obviously going to be pretty slippery. The shape of the bottle makes it hard to grip, and therefore, hard to use. Even if you are not shaving during your shower, it&#x27;s still really tricky to get the last amount of shaving cream out of the bottle when there is only a little left because it is really hard to squeeze unless you are using two hands. It made me really appreciate aerosol shave cream packaging because at least then you know that you have used the entire product. I don&#x27;t like to waste and I&#x27;m going to have to throw this bottle away without using whatever is left because I simply cannot get it out.  Underwhelming Performance: My shave wasn&#x27;t noticeably better. My skin didn&#x27;t feel or look more moisturized after using this product.   The one redeeming characteristic of this shave cream is that it smells nice but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that purpose. In my opinion, a nice smell should be a given. I expected to just be able to use it in the shower with ease and to have better moisturized skin. Neither of which was accomplished with this product.</li>
    <li> I had never heard of the &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34; before a friend brought hers with us on vacation.  I had forgotten my gel, so she allowed me to use hers.  I have not gone back to gel since.  This goes on smoothly, protects skin from the razor fabulously, washes off easily, leaves skin feeling smooth, and smells great to boot!  I will never go back to normal gel or cream.</li>
    <li> Only shave cream/gel I will use. Nothing else comes close to giving me a close shave with no irritation. I have super sensitive skin, and this does the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving cream and is hard to find in stores anymore!</li>
    <li> I adore this stuff. My legs (and lady area) ADORE this stuff. It&#x27;s fantastic!!! My legs are silky smooth and actually feel slippery while they&#x27;re still wet. One bottle can last over a month even if you&#x27;re shaving every couple of days. I use about a green olives worth for my entire leg, bikini area to toes.</li>
    <li> My favorite shaving cream. You squeeze a little and you&#x27;re good to go! :) I always had trouble buying shaving cream until I discovered this one!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving cream, and I can no longer find it anywhere at the store. It doesn&#x27;t foam up, so you get a closer shave, while still getting a layer of moisture. Plus, this one is formulated specifically for dry skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and won&#x27;t go back!</li>
    <li> Love this product! Smooth shaving with much less skin irritation.  The other shaving lotions do not compare! I have not been able to find Skintimate shaving lotion at my local stores any longer.  I am so glad I could buy some on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shaving creams that say they&#x27;re for dry skin but this is the only one that seems to really moisturize.</li>
    <li> I have read that some other users have complained about this &amp;#34;gunking up&amp;#34; their razors, and while that may seem to be the issue, I usually end up rinsing mine multiple times during a shave anyways, so it does not bother me.  For this being a &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; product, it works well.  I find that it works better than the other shave gels that are available in the big box retailers, but not as well as some of the high-end mens items.  All in all, I think it&#x27;s worth what you pay, and you get a decently close shave.  Buying a 6 pack on here is most assuredly one of the cheapest ways of purchasing this item.</li>
    <li> This is not as adveftised,it does not foam up at.Takes half a bottle to shave one time.Waste of money,hate this product.Wont order again.</li>
    <li> I love this shave cream.  It&#x27;s excellent for moisturizing but also good for someone with sensitive legs that sometime get irritated by shaving.  I&#x27;m starting to have a hard time finding it so i hope they don&#x27;t quit making it.  i have used only this since it has been put on the shelf.</li>
    <li> I started trying different shaving creams/lotions (A LOT of them) after I suddenly developed an allergy to my normal shaving cream.  I&#x27;ve tried all the major foaming ones (skintimate, barbasol, you name it. If it&#x27;s sold in a store I&#x27;ve tried it.) and also some other lotions like EOS.  None have worked as well as this one. As some reviewers mentioned, it does tend to clog on the razor so you do have to rinse your razor more thoroughly and more often but it my mind that&#x27;s  a small price to pay for a great shave. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the bottle being slippery. It is a bit hard to get the last bit out, but packing it against your palm seems to work well. I get VERY dry skin that would not stop itching in the winter no matter how much lotion I slathered on, and every time I shaved I would get horrible razor burn.  Using this stuff, I get a closer shave and I never get razor burn.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t break me out. My local store stopped carrying this so I tried the EOS and instantly noticed my razor had an uncomfortable drag that I never get from this stuff and my legs were a lot drier after showering, so I decided to see if they had this on Amazon and thank goodness they did.  Side note ladies, if you want the smoothest legs of your life, try exfoliating, then smooth on this stuff and let it sink in for a minute or so, then shave. Follow with lotion afterwards and you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
    <li> This is definitely different than the gel products from this same brand. It&#x27;s more creamy and oily, so it does feel quite luxurious on your skin and it does an okay job of soaking in for smoother skin. However, it&#x27;s more difficult to work into a lather compared to the gel products, so you will need to use more. Overall, I like it because of how my skin feels after I use it...but it just depends on what you&#x27;re looking for and what you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro tip- I felt like a fool when I first tried to use the product because of the weird design. Once I figured it out, I realized it was pretty easy. You just pull the pink flower looking thing- no need to twist. Then you squeeze and the cream comes out in a nice even stream.</li>
    <li> I like this so much better then regular shave gel, I get a much closer, cleaner shave, but don&#x27;t knick my legs or get razor burn anymore like I used to with regular shave gel.  My legs aren&#x27;t dry anymore either, they&#x27;re much much softer looking/feeling so I don&#x27;t have to slather on moisturizer. The container looks small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts for  a pretty long time. Yes the pull top is a bit of a pain to use and it does take forever to rinse out of your razor blade,  but if you can look past those two minor flaws, it&#x27;s a great product performance wise, it does what it says.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have very sensitive skin when it comes to shaving and I also suffer from eczema. It is non foaming and more like a lotion that leaves your skin nice and smooth for the razor to pass over and also leaves the skin nice and smooth (instead of dry and rubbery) after rinsing off. I am not sure what I will ever do if they stop making this stuff.</li>
    <li> This shave cream is really nice.  Not only does it help with the shave but leaves your skin very moisturized</li>
