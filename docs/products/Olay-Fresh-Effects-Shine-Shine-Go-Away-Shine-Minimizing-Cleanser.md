      <li>This cleaner had kept my skin fresh and light-feeling and with no shiny layer of oil on top of my face from morning to night!</li>
      <li>You use it sparingly, it does a great job cleaning your pores and leaving your face feeling soft and refreshed.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s creamy and lathers easily.</li>
      <li>This is a new product for Olay and it is a good one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally found a cleanser that my skin</li>
      <li>Great for daily use.</li>
      <li>I stay shine free (</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s nothing this good out there as far as a one step cleanser for this amount of money.</li>

      <li>The combo of the cleanser and face brush leave my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>

      <li>this product does it leave your face soft and smelling nice.</li>
      <li>The cream is a light gray color which makes it look pretty cool.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly, product as described.</li>
      <li>picked this up on a whim during a quick trip the the drugstore.</li>
      <li>when I wash and I love finally being able to wash my face and not having to check a mirror all day to see how oily it&#x27;s gotten.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is also good because some face washes make my skin flaky.</li>
      <li>and it was a nice enough size sample that it lasted two weeks which is what you need to tell if a product is working for your skin type.  </li>
      <li>I bought this first as a sample size with the cleansing brush and couldn&#x27;t wait to buy full size.</li>
      <li>While it was very effective, I fear it was clogging my pores in order to keep the oil under control and besides, it&#x27;s just one more step in my complicated skincare regimen</li>
      <li>AND it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
      <li>This really keeps the shine at bay!</li>
      <li>Matiifying is the way to go, the problem is no matter how many times a day I blot it just comes back.</li>

      <li>I wish i can find them easily in any local stores.</li>
      <li>It feels like my skin can really \\&quot;breathe\\&quot;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been really sweaty in california this summer.  </li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive, blochy, and combination (oily around the nose, dry on the cheeks) and this stuff makes it clean and fresh and even seems to calm the blochyness.  </li>
      <li>Really minimizes the shine on my face during the day.  </li>
      <li>It really helps to take the shine away before I apply my makeup.</li>
      <li>I also like that it is gentle.  </li>
      <li>and it really does keep shine away while gently cleansing the skin.</li>
      <li>It keeps the shine away for the whole day.</li>
      <li>And it takes for ever to wash off, really slimy ):</li>
      <li>I bought this on clearance at a local store and my roommate loves it he switched from his Neutrogena oil free to this.  </li>
      <li>really reduces my shine on face throughout the day</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;re not a greaseball, this product will probably be too much for you.</li>
      <li>It is a decent cleanser and does minimize the shine for awhile</li>
      <li>I bought this cleanser and had high hopes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not an Olay fan since their products are normally moisturing-</li>
      <li>I use this cleanser with a neutrogena oil minimizing toner and the Olay fresh effects long live moisture lotion</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a new product for Olay and it is a good one.  You use it sparingly, it does a great job cleaning your pores and leaving your face feeling soft and refreshed.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The shine is not completely gone, but a vast improvement. Plus, it feels nice when I massage it on my face : )</li>
    <li> I bought some of this at the store and since I am prone to oily skin, I bought it. It is a decent cleanser and does minimize the shine for awhile but it does not last all day. My main complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to wash all the way off when I use it, it feels like there is some residue on my face after using it instead of that freshly washed feeling that you get after washing your face. For that reason alone I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been really sweaty in california this summer.  Even though I don&#x27;t usually break out at all, the weather has made my t-zone oily and gross, my skin is usually dry..  This face wash is GREAT and fixes the problem.  The formula is really creamy and thick.  Even a little pea sized amount washes my whole face, so I think this bottle will last me a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, which is also good because some face washes make my skin flaky.</li>
    <li> i got this in a small sample tube when i purchased the va-va-vivid brush (which was disappointing) and liked it so much i bought a full size tube. i love the scent and the consistency, it&#x27;s creamy and lathers easily. a little bit of the product goes a long way. it makes my face feel clean and soft. does it reduce oil? for me, not really. i think that&#x27;s because i use the cleanser and then shower in the morning. maybe if i used it in the shower or afterwards it would work better for my oily skin.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It has a great scent to it. I use this cleanser in the morning like it recommends and it only makes sense to use it in the morning to control the oil on your face throughout the day. The cream is a light gray color which makes it look pretty cool. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel dry after using it. It somewhat helps reduce some shine on my face, but you won&#x27;t see such a dramatic difference. This product also helped clear up some acne on my face which is a plus! I will definitely repurchase this product. You can find coupons for a dollar off this product in your local ads.</li>
    <li> good product, fast shipping, happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser and had high hopes. I have combination skin with a lot of shine in the tip of my nose mostly. I know that the product doesn&#x27;t totally eliminate shine, but I was hoping that I would see some difference. I used this product both day and night since it also claimed to remove make up and dirt. Not the case! I still had to use make-up wipes after using this product because it didn&#x27;t get the make-up off completely. The only thing this product does it leave your face soft and smelling nice. Other than that I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
    <li> Works great and really cuts out the shine. Will definitely buy again in the future. Also used tinted moisturizer in the bb line.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the stores near me. Love LOVE love this stuff.</li>
    <li> This removes makeup in one step which is why I love it. It takes off mascara-yes, mascara. Wet, lather, rinse, no need to repeat. There&#x27;s nothing this good out there as far as a one step cleanser for this amount of money.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample and it was a nice enough size sample that it lasted two weeks which is what you need to tell if a product is working for your skin type.  My skin is sensitive, blochy, and combination (oily around the nose, dry on the cheeks) and this stuff makes it clean and fresh and even seems to calm the blochyness.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Really minimizes the shine on my face during the day.  Will definitely buy this regularly as my beauty regimen.</li>
    <li> Love this product, use all the time to remove my makeup</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite facial cleanser. I&#x27;m so sad Olay discontinued it. Amazon is the only place I can find it at this point. It really cleans your face thoroughly, takes of any make up (including mascara) and doesn&#x27;t dry you out. Also doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. It lathers up well with just a small amount. Love love love it.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make any difference for me. And it takes for ever to wash off, really slimy ):</li>
    <li> I am not particularly impressed with this cleanser - it doesn&#x27;t feel like my oily skin is really clean, and that all my make up is removed.  Maybe it helps with the shine but I cant say for sure.  I will continue to use  Olay foaming cleanser for oily skin (blue and black tude) which does a better job.</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever. So that I can find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Bought this for a family member who can no longer find it at the store. Great product, uses it with the lotion. Arrived quickly, product as described. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to find something that actually works for years now. This really keeps the shine at bay!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy mine here but wanted to leave a review on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered from acne since I was a teenager and now in my mid-30s it hasn&#x27;t gotten better. I have had a greasy,shiny face as long as I can remember and as a foundation wearer- its truly a mess. Oil can age you in ways you cannot believe. It settles into every crevice and wrinkle in your face to highlight it. Matiifying is the way to go, the problem is no matter how many times a day I blot it just comes back. No matter the weather.&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up on a whim during a quick trip the the drugstore. And I have to tell you- I&#x27;m not an Olay fan since their products are normally moisturing- a total no-no for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am not surprised at all to see 100% positive reviews here. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve used EVERYTHING. I can wash my face in the morning, apply my make up and go all day long into the night with no shine. I simply cannot believe it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love and will buy as many bottles as I can find and afford as lines like this don&#x27;t seem to hang around long.&lt;br /&gt;It is refreshing to find a product that delivers and at an appropriate price to boot.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I wish I could still find it in store&#x27;s!</li>
    <li> I love it! I&#x27;ve always had issues with cleansers, but this stuff works. It does take time, and I do use the other fresh effects products. But is def worth the money!</li>
    <li> Did not do anything for my  face</li>
    <li> I put this on everyday twice a day and my oily skin was still there and I broke out even more</li>
    <li> I bought this on clearance at a local store and my roommate loves it he switched from his Neutrogena oil free to this.  Break outs are down since he switched and he likes the shine control.  He suffers from mild breakouts, so this problely not the product someone with acne.</li>
    <li> I have had extremely oily skin my entire life, even into adulthood (late 20s now) and I have used proactiv, clinique, and thousands of other drug store and mail order skin products. I was so desperate that when I&#x27;d recently found that putting \\&quot;monistat chafing gel\\&quot; on my t-zone helps keep oil at bay I actually starting using it! While it was very effective, I fear it was clogging my pores in order to keep the oil under control and besides, it&#x27;s just one more step in my complicated skincare regimen so it worked, but I wasn&#x27;t 100% satisfied with it. This cleaner had kept my skin fresh and light-feeling and with no shiny layer of oil on top of my face from morning to night! It feels like my skin can really \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; when I wash and I love finally being able to wash my face and not having to check a mirror all day to see how oily it&#x27;s gotten. I use this cleanser with a neutrogena oil minimizing toner and the Olay fresh effects long live moisture lotion and I am now fearless with great skin all day. This product passes the camera flash (terrible for oily skin!) and hot humid day tests :-)</li>
    <li> The face wash does a really great job at making my skin grease-free. However, it makes me break out. I normally only get 1 or 2 pimples a month, but when I was using this product, I constantly had break outs everywhere on my face until I stopped using it 2 months later. If you do use this face wash, I recommend using a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> Perfect solution to oily  skin. I have oily t-section and it is super irritating even in dry weather. I have used many products in the past which have left my skin very dry and flaky followed by very oily. I tried olay fresh effects and was not expecting anything great. In fact I was sort of prepared for the disappointment. I was so wrong. Loved the product from the moment I washed it off my face. My skin felt supple and nice. Not dry not oily. Just nice. I will continue to use this product and will recommend it to anyone looking for less shine experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cleansers I have used in a long time. It actually does what it says and I even got my fiance to use it for his shiny forehead. A+</li>
    <li> My weird combination/oily/acne-prone skin seems to HATE every single cleanser I&#x27;ve tried up to date. Literally every single one has either irritated my skin, made me more oily, dried my skin out, broke me out or (I don&#x27;t know how this happened) one even managed to somehow burn a layer of my skin off... So frustrating. This cleanser though...it&#x27;s perfect, it does not dry my skin out, break me out, make me oily or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels clean, but not tight, dry and uncomfortable like every other cleanser has left my face feeling AND it manages to keep the shine on my  T-Zone to a minimum for most of the day (over 9 hours). I&#x27;m so happy I finally found a cleanser that my skin and I are happy with AND it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best! I got a small tube of it with the Va-Va-Vivid face brush. It is awesome! Best face wash I have ever used. I have weird skin, it&#x27;s usually oily in some places with random patches of dry flaky skin. This evened out my skin, no oiliness, no dry patches! The combo of the cleanser and face brush leave my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleanser. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products for my face, and this is the only thing that&#x27;s completely cleared my breakouts. It will dry your face just a little, but it will be wonderfully remedied with some CeraVe moisturizer. Awesome awesome awesome.</li>
    <li> Literally love this stuff. I cannot find anything that I like as well as this product. I have extremly oily skin and it leaves my skin still feeling soft without the extra shine. Would recommend to anyone who has oily skin!</li>
    <li> I bought this first as a sample size with the cleansing brush and couldn&#x27;t wait to buy full size. I have sensitive skin and it really does keep shine away while gently cleansing the skin. Great for daily use.</li>
    <li> If you have habitually oily skin like me you&#x27;re probably skeptical (I only tried it because the price wasn&#x27;t too bad). I&#x27;ve been let down too many times before, but I&#x27;m pretty impressed. The morning that I use this wash on my face I stay shine free (but I have to use it every morning because it doesn&#x27;t continue on to the next day). If you&#x27;re worried about shine but you&#x27;re not a greaseball, this product will probably be too much for you.</li>
    <li> I never ever leave reviews. I have oily skin my cousin bought this by when she was visiting I inquired I tried.. and I fell in love. My face felt perfect not dry not oily.. Perfect. It keeps the shine away for the whole day. I have never loved a skin product this much. I would recommend to everybody..</li>
    <li> This is a great cleanser if you have oily skin. It really helps to take the shine away before I apply my makeup. The only con is that it is very difficult to rinse off.</li>
    <li> It is ok, does what it says, but nothing unusual.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Great result. I wish i can find them easily in any local stores.</li>
    <li> best wash ive ever used , for oily combo skin! really reduces my shine on face throughout the day</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have been using this product for a while and we love it!!  It smells great and it works really well.  Your face feels refreshed and clean after you use it.  It helps clean out your pores and gets rid of that tired look.  I also like that it is gentle.  I don&#x27;t find that it dries out my skin.  It&#x27;s also affordable.  It&#x27;s great for people with oily skin!!</li>
