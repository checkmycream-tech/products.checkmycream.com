### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product!  </li>
      <li>I am so happy I did!!!</li>
      <li>and I am absolutely  thrilled with the results !!</li>
      <li>Which is ideally how you want them to be, so that they can withstand banging into things without snapping off.</li>
      <li>My nails are great.</li>
      <li>LOL.  </li>
      <li>The convenience is great</li>
      <li>and it has worked remarkably.</li>
      <li>This supplement sounded good.</li>
      <li>Good product--I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
      <li>Their price is good and I received it promptly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got it!</li>
      <li>The rate at which they are growing is phenomenal!</li>
      <li>I never use a hair drier or any kind of iron.</li>
      <li>This product is really good, so I was happy to find it online through this particular vendor.</li>
      <li>For that, I won&#x27;t purchase until more information is released.</li>
      <li>This combination worked better and faster (for me)</li>
      <li>but this one had more of one of the ingredients.</li>
      <li>I have been taking them for 6 months now, and my hair is thicker, stronger and more lustrous than I ever remember it being.</li>
      <li>but I think it will take a couple more months to determine if my hair has grown in thicker.  </li>
      <li>so I am going to re-order for 2 more months to see what happens.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon suggested it.</li>
      <li>Love it, will continue to use it</li>
      <li>and I love having them sent to me without having to reorder.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It came to a point where patches of scalp were becoming visible.  </li>
      <li>It is damaged easily.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m already seeing a HUGE difference in both my hair and my nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got to tell you this has made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s important to gracefully accept the changes that come with advancing age, but I just couldn&#x27;t muster any feelings of grace as my hairline began to recede.</li>
      <li>Using both at the same time will give great results.</li>
      <li>I noticed significant improvement within two weeks or so after switching brands and reducing dosage.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I do lose more in the shower, but the thickness really has doubled!</li>
      <li>but it was a lot more money, and I have to say that this is comparable for much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had 1 full inch of growth in these 60 days.</li>
      <li>I took a full months worth of these</li>
      <li>They are much healthier and growing very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have problem hair that is naturally blond, fine and light.</li>
      <li>super fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It has been over a year now and still no new growth, but the texture of my EXTREMELY fine hair is slightly better, BuT  for whatever reason it no longer holds a permanent.  </li>
      <li>I did have extremely thick, beautiful hair.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser confirmed there is lots of new growth.  </li>
      <li>Amazon is very reputable but today we live in a world where we can only &amp;#34;trust&amp;#34; the label ingredients.</li>
      <li>What I like most about this is only 1 tablet per day.  </li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>absolutely nothing!</li>
      <li>I send them straight to this product on Amazon.com!</li>
      <li>, I haven&#x27;t measured exactly how much, but I will post an updated review in another month.</li>
      <li>No adverse effects and a great price for a 2 month supply in comparison to other similar vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The first month I really didn&#x27;t notice much of anything.</li>
      <li>The product really works-almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really see any change with the hair, which is why I&#x27;ve given it a 4 star as opposed to 5 star review.</li>
      <li>It really strengthens and re grows hair</li>
      <li>Not so much on my skin and nails that i noticed</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;silvering&amp;#34; up as much (I&#x27;m 77).</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for your service.</li>
      <li>For example, I swear by Garden of Life supplement(s) and product(s) (organic, pure, potent etc etc) IF you search for &amp;#34;Escali Hair Supplements&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Escali&amp;#34; or anything close, there are NO websites or places to buy these from other then</li>
      <li>I bought several orders of Elon Matrix 5,000 Biotin, but Escali is the exact same thing and the cost is a lot more manageable.</li>
      <li>Best of all my thin dry hair feels thicker and shinier than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
      <li>if I just give it &amp;#34;a little more</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t notice it right away, but after two months, you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference.  </li>
      <li>After two months my new hair was so noticeable that even my hairstylist commented.</li>
      <li>After 2 months of taking 1 tablet a day, I began to get new growth around my hairline and at the crown.  </li>
      <li>and I started seeing new hair growth after about 45 days.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been taking this long enough to notice a difference but they&#x27;re easy to take</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently finishing my first bottle which was 2 month supply.</li>
      <li>I started taking these pills back in November 2012, the exact date was the 15th, so it&#x27;s been about 2 months.</li>
      <li>I am still deciding if I will continue it as I have been a life time perm user just to add some body and volume to my limp fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve clearly noticed an improvement with the nails.  </li>
      <li>Within weeks of taking one per day I could tell that the thinning had completely stopped .  </li>
      <li>So far, I like the pills as I can tell there is some change in my natural hair.</li>
      <li>I would like to continue using this product for at least another month before I give an actual honest opinion.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is now almost four months and my hair looks and feel more dense than I can remember in the recent past.</li>
      <li>I will definitely continue taking these vitamins as I get older.</li>
      <li>I tried different shampoos and vitamins but this brand/strength has helped me put a stop to the shedding and regrow normal hair again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Now if the makers could add something to bring back the lush hair I once had, it&#x27;d get 5 stars!</li>
      <li>This form of biotin was suggested by my doctor for general health and to maybe help my thinning hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a year now, and my hairline has grown back completely.</li>
      <li>I was a skeptic , but after my last pregnancy my  hair was  becoming dry and thin and  I was willing to try anything.</li>
      <li>The other product I tried was 3 capsules per day and tasted really</li>
      <li>I have thin nails that break easily</li>

<li> I was steadily losing hair over the past five years .</li>
<li> or so it was clear that my hair was growing faster and less was falling out, but no new growth.  </li>
<li> but she started seeing a difference long ago.</li>
<li> small pills too so not hard to swallow ..</li>
<li> No more hair loss and new hair is growing in.</li>
<li> Other than the usual dryness that a new perm brings, no curl held.  </li>
<li> hair which is normally fragile is stronger and I have less breakage.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t beleive that a little pill makes such a difference</li>
<li> If you need help with energy, pain, or thin hair or bad nails, this is a great product for you.</li>
<li> I have very thinning hair and weak nails due to a thyroid condition.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s much harder to measure hair growth.</li>
<li> Anyway, post-menopause, my forehead was gaining ground alarmingly, so I poked around online and read a bunch of reviews for hair-growth products.</li>
<li> A few years back, I used to take Hair Formula 37</li>
<li> My hair now grows a lot faster, and although it hasn&#x27;t regained its original thickness (probably never will), at least that part hasn&#x27;t gotten worse.</li>
<li> I purchased this in May 2014 and considered returning it due to the pill size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product!  My hair starting thinning badly with early onset menopause, which was so depressing. After researching several vitamins, I took a chance on Escali because of its combination of Biotin, Silica and L-Cystine, which was very hard to find in one tablet. After 2 months of taking 1 tablet a day, I began to get new growth around my hairline and at the crown.  I have been taking them for 6 months now, and my hair is thicker, stronger and more lustrous than I ever remember it being. I will definitely continue taking these vitamins as I get older. If you&#x27;re experiencing thinning hair from illness or menopause, you have to give these vitamins a try.  Follow the instructions and give the vitamins a couple of months to build up in your system and start working. I am so happy I did!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m currently finishing my first bottle which was 2 month supply. I have problem hair that is naturally blond, fine and light. It is damaged easily. I never use a hair drier or any kind of iron. I just cannot. My lifetime issue include split ends, hair loss, tangling after shower (conditioning doesn&#x27;t help), having hard time brushing and combing it. After taking escali for 2 months, I can tell that I start having less tangling and hair loss while brushing. Ordering another one. If you have similar problems, give it a shot.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the pills for the past month and I have noticed some change in my hair in terms of thickness.  I would like to continue using this product for at least another month before I give an actual honest opinion.  So far, I like the pills as I can tell there is some change in my natural hair.</li>
    <li> This brand had all three of the recommended supplements for growing thicker hair in one tablet. I have been taking it for two months, but I did take a break when I started breaking out because I wasn&#x27;t taking a B vitamin supplement which is said to help curb breaking from the biotin. My nails seem stronger but I think it will take a couple more months to determine if my hair has grown in thicker.  I have been taking blackcurrant seed oil as well to help. In the meantime, it is convenient to take this tablet instead of 3 different pills.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic , but after my last pregnancy my  hair was  becoming dry and thin and  I was willing to try anything. After four weeks of this stuff my hair was no longer thinning as it used too. After two months my new hair was so noticeable that even my hairstylist commented. Best of all my thin dry hair feels thicker and shinier than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This supplement is absolutely terrific.  Within weeks of taking one per day my hair wasn&#x27;t falling out in the shower or from brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair which is normally fragile is stronger and I have less breakage. I will definitely continue using this supplement for as long as needed.</li>
    <li> I was steadily losing hair over the past five years . It was getting to the point where my scalp was visible.&lt;br /&gt;I have used biotin supplements in the past but they don&#x27;t compare to Escali . Within weeks of taking one per day I could tell that the thinning had completely stopped .  I have been taking since as part a daily regimen .&lt;br /&gt;It is now almost four months and my hair looks and feel more dense than I can remember in the recent past.</li>
    <li> I ordered Biotin after months of seeing my hair get thinner and thinner. It turns out my brush blow dryer was the culprit. I have taken Biotin for almost 5 months and I started seeing new hair growth after about 45 days.  My hairdresser confirmed there is lots of new growth.  I have not seen a change in my fingernails at all. I have thin nails that break easily and I have not noticed any change in texture or strength.</li>
    <li> It really strengthens and re grows hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Escali 5000 biotin mcg. silica &amp; L-Cystine for awhile and it has worked remarkably. I have very thinning hair and weak nails due to a thyroid condition. I&#x27;ve got to tell you this has made a huge difference. I finally have my hair growing in and my nails have grown quite a bit. Love it, will continue to use it and it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I had gotten very ill with c-diff and stayed that way for months. My hair started falling out. I don&#x27;t mean loosing some, we&#x27;re talking loosing big amounts each day. Shower drain covered with hair. I did have extremely thick, beautiful hair. The doctors wanted me to start on an expensive supplement to help with growing my hair back. I got on the internet and searched for like ingredients and found this escali Biotin, silica and L-cystine in the same strength for 1/2 the prescribed supplements cost. No more hair loss and new hair is growing in. The proper nutrition changes a lot of things. I would recommend this product highly.</li>
    <li> The product really works-almost immediately.  I had taken it previously, and saw results, but got lazy.  As soon as I took it again, it worked within a week.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking this long enough to notice a difference but they&#x27;re easy to take and I love having them sent to me without having to reorder. Thank you so much for your service. Keep them coming.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
    <li> I have been faithful in taking each day. In around three to four months I will review &amp; get back.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my hair and nails, now that I&#x27;m in menopause.  I&#x27;ve clearly noticed an improvement with the nails.  They are much healthier and growing very quickly.  I don&#x27;t really see any change with the hair, which is why I&#x27;ve given it a 4 star as opposed to 5 star review.</li>
    <li> Fully equivalent to alternatives but this one had more of one of the ingredients. (I am MD husband of consumer)</li>
    <li> My hairdresser asked me what I had been taking/doing because my hair has doubled in thickness!  You won&#x27;t notice it right away, but after two months, you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference.  I do lose more in the shower, but the thickness really has doubled!</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s supposed to happen again?  LOL.  I&#x27;m trapped!  I feel like if I just give it &amp;#34;a little more time,&amp;#34; it might have noticeable effects.  Hmmm!</li>
    <li> These hair vitamins seemed to have helped my hair become stronger/thicker. I have been using them for the last 4 months and my hair is healthier.  It may have grown slightly.</li>
    <li> FOR REAL!&lt;br /&gt;Now, as usual, who knows if is the biotin working or that she was meant to stop shedding? She also says that her nails are stronger and she will continue taking it because it must be working. She took it for about 1 year now but she started seeing a difference long ago. Now I hope that this review does not make the price go up!!</li>
    <li> This product did not work for me - my nails peeled severely. I noticed significant improvement within two weeks or so after switching brands and reducing dosage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Escali biotin/silica/L-cysteine for 2 months. I usually shed lots of hair in spring (noticeable when I Swiffer the bathroom floor and in the sink). No longer. I&#x27;m retaining the hair I&#x27;ve got and it&#x27;s thicker and I&#x27;m not &amp;#34;silvering&amp;#34; up as much (I&#x27;m 77). Good product--I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> I began taking these several weeks ago. Prior to that, I was taking 5000 mcg of biotin per day.  My nails seem to be growing a bit faster than they were with the biotin alone, although my nails aren&#x27;t the reason I&#x27;m taking it.  I&#x27;m taking it for hair growth but it&#x27;s much harder to measure hair growth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite a wihle and I&#x27;ve noticed hair growth in places that were thinning and none of those areas have gotten worse.  I also like that I only have to take one tablet a day.  Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the second product I have tried.  What I like most about this is only 1 tablet per day.  The other product I tried was 3 capsules per day and tasted really bad.&lt;br /&gt;I have been taking this product for about 1 month and the hair thinning seems to have stopped a bit.</li>
    <li> there is a weird smell in this bottle. I am not sure if it is toxic.</li>
    <li> I started taking Escali 5000 mcg Biotin Silica &amp; L-Cystine a little less than 2 months ago and I&#x27;m already seeing a HUGE difference in both my hair and my nails. My nails are stronger than they have been in years! The rate at which they are growing is phenomenal! Plus, my hair is getting thicker than I ever imagined it could. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair was so thick. I thought I&#x27;d have to wait a long time to see improvements, but I am pleasantly surprised to see noticeable results in less than 2 months. Even friends have noticed the difference and want to know how they can get thicker hair and stronger nails. I send them straight to this product on Amazon.com! I&#x27;ll use this for the rest of my life!</li>
    <li> I started taking these pills back in November 2012, the exact date was the 15th, so it&#x27;s been about 2 months. The first month I really didn&#x27;t notice much of anything. But within the beginning of the second month, about week 5 of taking them, I noticed my nails just took off!  I have to also say that my nails are very hard, but yet flexible.  Which is ideally how you want them to be, so that they can withstand banging into things without snapping off. My hair has always been very slow to grow, slow as in about 1/4 of an inch a month. And I&#x27;ve noticed that it has picked up growth, I haven&#x27;t measured exactly how much, but I will post an updated review in another month. A few years back, I used to take Hair Formula 37 and it worked well but it was a lot more money, and I have to say that this is comparable for much cheaper. I definitely recommend taking these.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what to make of this product.  The more expensive brand was suggested by my dermatologist and was told it would be 6 months to a year to show any improvement or difference in my hair.  She was correct.  At about 5 months or so it was clear that my hair was growing faster and less was falling out, but no new growth.  It has been over a year now and still no new growth, but the texture of my EXTREMELY fine hair is slightly better, BuT  for whatever reason it no longer holds a permanent.  Other than the usual dryness that a new perm brings, no curl held.  I am still deciding if I will continue it as I have been a life time perm user just to add some body and volume to my limp fine hair.  I have also realized my nails have grown faster, but again not any stronger.  I dont think it is the product per se, but it hasnt worked for my particular hair type in the way I was hoping,  which is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s important to gracefully accept the changes that come with advancing age, but I just couldn&#x27;t muster any feelings of grace as my hairline began to recede. (If I was a man, maybe, but I know they hate going bald, too!) Anyway, post-menopause, my forehead was gaining ground alarmingly, so I poked around online and read a bunch of reviews for hair-growth products. This supplement sounded good. I&#x27;m so glad I got it! Within a month little baby hairs were visible on areas that had been shiny before. It&#x27;s been a year now, and my hairline has grown back completely. I&#x27;m so grateful!</li>
    <li> I took a full months worth of these but I could not tell a difference at all. May work for some but not me</li>
    <li> I take these pills with all my vitamins every morning..  You have to be diligent and take everyday and you will see the results after 6 weeks..</li>
    <li> We have used this product for over two months now, and we&#x27;ve noticed improvements ---hair strands are thicker, new hair sprouting, and less shedding of hair. We recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have completed 1 bottle so I have taken them for 60 days. I&#x27;ve had 1 full inch of growth in these 60 days. No adverse effects and a great price for a 2 month supply in comparison to other similar vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a manufacturer website for this product bc I haven&#x27;t had any luck with research on this brand</li>
    <li> quick shipping and the taste isnt bad .. small pills too so not hard to swallow .. i have alot of hope they will work as well</li>
    <li> My hairs were falling out at an abnormal rate .  I had to buy those catchers so that they wouldn&#x27;t clog the sink or drains.&lt;br /&gt;It came to a point where patches of scalp were becoming visible.  I came here to Amazon to search for a solution. I tried different shampoos and vitamins but this brand/strength has helped me put a stop to the shedding and regrow normal hair again.&lt;br /&gt;I started taking it as directed about two and half months ago and I am absolutely  thrilled with the results !! I can&#x27;t beleive that a little pill makes such a difference but thankfully it does.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in May 2014 and considered returning it due to the pill size. I never returned it so I decided take them once my Hairfinity was low. I must say my hair was defiantly thicker.. This combination worked better and faster (for me) then several months of Hairfinity HOWEVER...&lt;br /&gt;I do question the manufacture. For example, I swear by Garden of Life supplement(s) and product(s) (organic, pure, potent etc etc) IF you search for &amp;#34;Escali Hair Supplements&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Escali&amp;#34; or anything close, there are NO websites or places to buy these from other then Amazon :-/ not even a company website to reference standards, products, ingredients, testing... absolutely nothing! Amazon is very reputable but today we live in a world where we can only &amp;#34;trust&amp;#34; the label ingredients. I just find it a little odd that there is no website or point of contact for this product. For that, I won&#x27;t purchase until more information is released. The convenience is great but I&#x27;d rather buy Biotin, Silica and L-Cystine separate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this for a month and I can already feel my hair getting thicker along with a thickening shampoo. Using both at the same time will give great results. Will continue to purchase this!</li>
    <li> This form of biotin was suggested by my doctor for general health and to maybe help my thinning hair. My hair now grows a lot faster, and although it hasn&#x27;t regained its original thickness (probably never will), at least that part hasn&#x27;t gotten worse. My nails are great. I bought several orders of Elon Matrix 5,000 Biotin, but Escali is the exact same thing and the cost is a lot more manageable. I&#x27;m glad Amazon suggested it. Now if the makers could add something to bring back the lush hair I once had, it&#x27;d get 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I have been taking one per day, every day for 2 months.  I have not noticed a difference but it does say to wait 4-6 months so I am going to re-order for 2 more months to see what happens.  I will update then....</li>
    <li> This product is really good, so I was happy to find it online through this particular vendor. Their price is good and I received it promptly. I will continue to reorder from them. If you need help with energy, pain, or thin hair or bad nails, this is a great product for you.</li>
    <li> These worked well on my hair. Not so much on my skin and nails that i noticed</li>
    <li> super fast shipping! second time order this, and probably not the last. thanks!</li>
