    <li> When it comes to dark spots I&#x27;ve tried it all (at-home peels, hellaciously over priced professional peels, painful laser peels, murad/sephora hydroquinone, prescription higher % hydroquinone...) and have seen results but have never fully gotten rid of my spots. So. I wouldn&#x27;t call myself an expert, but I&#x27;ve had my fair share of experience dealing with dark spots.  This product actually works. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week and so far can see noticeable results- both in the lightening of dark spots and the quality/texture of my skin.  I will update after a full month with my final review, but so far the only thing I regret is money spent in the past. This system is effective and for the price, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Too fragrant to use on face. No appreciable difference with sun spots on hands, though did leave them feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I have used this for couple of months and my dark spots are significantly lighter. very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> no results, no improvement.</li>
    <li> love this. Really helped to fade my acne scars on my cheeks. Not to drying. No problem with peeling, flaking, or dry skin like other peels. I think it smells good as well. I&#x27;ll be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love these two serums. I have only been using them for about three days and nights and I can already see a difference! Recently, I&#x27;d noticed some small discolorations on my cheeks, nothing major. I assumed this was due to birth control pills and sun exposure. I don&#x27;t like to wear face makeup daily, so I needed a product to even-out my skin tone. I love the light, non-greasy, serum texture of both of these products and I will continue to use them!</li>
    <li> Good product, I highly recommend it ....</li>
    <li> I love these two products together! If you stay consistent you will definitely see results</li>
    <li> So far so good and hope to reorder sooon.</li>
    <li> OverNight peel came with open tube. Half of the cream leaked down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally shocked that this is working.  I got pregnancy mask pretty bad with my son but I&#x27;ve been hesitant to buy product.  I have good skin and I don&#x27;t use any product except sunblock.  I hate putting creams on my face because my skin tends to be oily and I just end up feeling greasy.  But THESE, wow!  I have to say that they are light and don&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky and they WORK.  The first week, I saw dramatic improvement.  After that, improvement slowed down, but it&#x27;s still getting better.  I&#x27;m really impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ll keep going until I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon anymore.  At this rate, that&#x27;ll probably be one more order and another month.  This was completely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Absolutely no changes to my skin.  What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for year. Having stopped using it daily for some period of time, ad soon as I start using it daily I see the difference it makes and how well it works very fast and effectively. I use it for acne spots and it does wonders. Also, being a flight attendant I need a moisturizer that will protect my face from drying out and fine lines and this product is amazing for that as well. Use it every night consistently and you will see how it makes your skin feel and look healthier.</li>
    <li> It is good stuff but I have to use it regularly it really works .</li>
    <li> amazing for dark spots and acne marks. Will purchase one from the seller again before I ran out.😊👍👍</li>
    <li> The results don&#x27;t last last long. I am an African American woman and the product actually does work, hence the four stars. However, if you stop using it then your dark spots will get darker. This is not a permanent fix, only temporary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a permanent fix for dark spots, I wear a bentonite clay and apple cider vinegar mask three times a week, and a grape seed and rosehip oil combination serum at night.</li>
    <li> After about 10 days of use, it cleared up an embarrassing dark spot left by acne.</li>
    <li> I am using this skin corrector to help me rid of some spots. It will take time, but mean while in order to see results I have to keep using them both.</li>
    <li> Items is as described and was as I expected. It has been almost 2 weeks and I can see the difference.  I use it on my face,  neck and chest, shoulders and back for sun spots.  They are almost gone</li>
