### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Dr. Miracle&#x27;s leave in conditioner, is the best conditioner I have ever tried.</li>
      <li>and i am happy with the result</li>
      <li>Works great for my hair after getting out of pool</li>
      <li>and i am happy with the result.</li>
      <li>It was delivered opened with a nice amount of the product spilled on the bag!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for all types of hair.</li>
      <li>Good price here.</li>
      <li>Nice to have a leave in condition.</li>
      <li>but it works great if your hair is freshly washed</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Oh, darn, I guess I&#x27;ll be going to hair store to spend money I don&#x27;t have on a better product.</li>
      <li>Love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
      <li>The conditioner that comes with hair color or dye works so much better</li>
      <li>Satisfied with this product</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s like nourishment for my hair.</li>
      <li>Nothing outstanding, okay.</li>
      <li>this one is doing its job:)</li>
      <li>I love Dr. Mircles products</li>
      <li>it makes the hair smooth, shiny, and more manageable.</li>
      <li>But not the best thing for the bottle not to be securely closed.</li>
      <li>but today i just added some to my water bottle, hoping that whatever good ingredients it does have will help it make for a decent watered-down detangler.</li>
      <li>I will keep using this product, makes my hair shiny and beautiful, I wish it came in a bigger bottle, because I have a lot of hair!</li>
      <li>tingles and feels great - leaves my hair super soft and smelling minty !</li>
      <li>It is not greasy it spreads well, does not leave residues and i feel the hair smooth.</li>
      <li>I became light headed during the course of styling my hair in cornrows and stop using it mid-use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, this formula is more enriched in ingredients that are meant to help in the health of hair so this was one of the main reasons i bought it.</li>
      <li>I geased and message my scalp with this leave in conditioner every other day, works very good for me my sister also use this daily..</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This product is exactly what I wanted, it actually came 2 days earlier than anticipated and was in good condition.</li>
      <li>First of the production company must have drop extra perfume oils in this bottle because the scent is too darn strong.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot, either, to cause this.</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>I am very upset</li>
      <li>I normally don&#x27;t write a review after one use</li>
      <li>though  i tend to go with products more heavy because usually they work better on my hair( conditioner, mask)</li>
      <li>I have 4c hair and live in the desert...</li>
      <li>Walmart stopped selling this where I live</li>
      <li>This product does wonders for natural styles and soft curls.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, and because of this i&#x27;ve only used it a few times (freshly cleansed hair)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the way this makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.  Again ladies you have to figure out what works for your hair.  Everybody&#x27;s hair is different.</li>
    <li> My likes this product</li>
    <li> Works great for my hair after getting out of pool</li>
    <li> Love it.  I have 4c hair and live in the desert...i use this to rehydrate my hair every day...as well as a deep conditioner on wash days..hair is soft and fluffy..but you have to mix with oil to achieve shine.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite leave in conditioner, it&#x27;s like nourishment for my hair. It keeps my edges intact, and prevent frizz. I love it.</li>
    <li> Usually i don&#x27;t critique smell when it comes to products because i just take for granted and expect that a product for hair will smell at least decent. The smell of this product is annoying, but it&#x27;s not why i&#x27;m giving it bad review. It&#x27;s a sidenote that i just wanted to get out of the way. On to the meat:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is just too watery. It just sits on my hair, dries it out, and causes it to stick together. It doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot, either, to cause this. I was expecting something thicker, i&#x27;ll admit, but in the case of this product its consistency works against it. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair, and because of this i&#x27;ve only used it a few times (freshly cleansed hair) but today i just added some to my water bottle, hoping that whatever good ingredients it does have will help it make for a decent watered-down detangler. But i would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. Walmart stopped selling this where I live so I had to look elsewhere. Good price here. Other bad thing was the bottle caps weren&#x27;t closed all the way so they leaked a little during the shipment. It didnt make a big mess with the leak. But not the best thing for the bottle not to be securely closed.</li>
    <li> It was delivered opened with a nice amount of the product spilled on the bag! I love Dr. Mircles products however this leave in conditioner is extremely watery!!</li>
    <li> I have a afro hair type 4a&amp;b and it is usually very hard to find products that leave my hair the way i want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not too expensive though it is more expensive than the other leave in i have purchased .&lt;br /&gt;However, this formula is more enriched in ingredients that are meant to help in the health of hair so this was one of the main reasons i bought it. I am not a fan of its texture and smell for me it is too liquid and the smell is not amazing. I am using on dry hair daily and i am happy with the result it makes the hair smooth, shiny, and more manageable. I tried once on dump hair it did not work well for me. So i am just using on dry hair and i am happy with the result. It is not greasy it spreads well, does not leave residues and i feel the hair smooth. though  i tend to go with products more heavy because usually they work better on my hair( conditioner, mask) this one is doing its job:)</li>
    <li> Nothing outstanding, okay. Similar to others, But is lightweight which is a plus .</li>
    <li> This product is exactly what I wanted, it actually came 2 days earlier than anticipated and was in good condition. I&#x27;ve read some of the earlier reviews about it being too watery but it works great if your hair is freshly washed and you apply it immediately after. This product does wonders for natural styles and soft curls.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this product</li>
    <li> I geased and message my scalp with this leave in conditioner every other day, works very good for me my sister also use this daily.. thanks</li>
    <li> I didnt work for me because its too watery. dried my hair instead of moisturize it I wont buy again sorry i couldnt give better review. The conditioner that comes with hair color or dye works so much better thats why I made this purchase</li>
    <li> I will keep using this product, makes my hair shiny and beautiful, I wish it came in a bigger bottle, because I have a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> if you are NOT using this every week to deep condition your hair then you ought to be ... tingles and feels great - leaves my hair super soft and smelling minty ! tingles for about an hour after you wash it out !&lt;br /&gt;If you do not have a sit under dryer i suggest wrapping your head in a plastic bag and wrap it in a towel for an hour or two ! the results will shock you !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
    <li> Nice to have a leave in condition. Always working on rebuilding my hair.</li>
    <li> I normally don&#x27;t write a review after one use but I don&#x27;t plan to use again so I have no choice. First of the production company must have drop extra perfume oils in this bottle because the scent is too darn strong. I became light headed during the course of styling my hair in cornrows and stop using it mid-use. Furthermore, the product is very thin...I guess I am not use the water-like consistency. I am very upset but maybe I can pass along to a friend. Oh, darn, I guess I&#x27;ll be going to hair store to spend money I don&#x27;t have on a better product. I am so mad right now.</li>
    <li> Dr. Miracle&#x27;s leave in conditioner, is the best conditioner I have ever tried. It&#x27;s good for all types of hair. Buy yours today!</li>
