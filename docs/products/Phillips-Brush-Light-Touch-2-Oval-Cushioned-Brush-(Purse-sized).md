      <li>We have used this brand brush since they were little girls and am so happy I can still find them on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I have used these brushes most of my adult life.  </li>
      <li>As a thin-haired female, this brush is the softest, most comfortable brush for my hair.</li>
      <li>good brush  easy on hair and small size great for my little girl</li>
      <li>For a real tangle friendly brush get this one...</li>

      <li>I give my daughters a new Phillips Light Touch brush every year for Christmas.</li>

      <li>What a terrific surprise to find it available at Amazon!</li>

      <li>Way better than the brushes we all find at our local Wal-Mart.  </li>

      <li>It works well with fine or thick hair and is excellent for wet or dry hair.  </li>
      <li>my daughter has absconded with one because even she loves it more than other brushes she has.</li>
      <li>Good brush, but really small for adult.  </li>
      <li>I use mine to blow dry my hair because it grips my fine hair to give it lift.</li>
      <li>I had one of the Phillips hair brushed for many years and finally had to thow away.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great brush, good quality and a perfect size for my 3 year old daughter.  I could not find anything like this at stores.  No more screaming when I brush her hair.</li>
    <li> I am a retired hairdresser and we used Phillips brushes all the time. Both sizes, big and small. My husband has been  using the small one for years. I had a hard time finding another one until I checked with Amazon.com. My husband was thrilled that he had a back-up one. It doesn&#x27;t tear out your hair and he can brush and dry his hair at the same time. I&#x27;d say this is a very good choice for a good hairbrush. Lots of professionals use them.</li>
    <li> I love the Phillips Light Touch brushes. I&#x27;ve used them since I was a little girl and refuse to use any other. I was so glad to see a &#x27;purse&#x27;-sized brush. I have two -- one for my purse and one for my travel bag.     If you love the Light Touch brush, you have to have one of these!</li>
    <li> Phillips Hairbrushes are the best.  Now I need to replace my larger one and I will be set.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. I had these brushes but could find anything similar till I thought of Amazon. Thank thank you so much.</li>
    <li> This is replacing an old brush that I really, really liked.  This brush rates only 1 &#x27;really&#x27;, but then we only just met.</li>
    <li> I have had 2 phillips brush&#x27;s for about 20  years.The one&#x27;s I just bought are not even close to as good as the old one&#x27;s.The bristles on my old one&#x27;s are thicker,and the white dots on the ends are bigger.I am a hairdresser and always loved them.I won&#x27;t be looking for them anymore.  Thank You  Carol Lee</li>
    <li> Nothing special about this hairbrush, it is a typical brush.  For a real tangle friendly brush get this one... The Wet Brush Detangling Shower Brush (you don&#x27;t have to use it in the shower obviously) - this works on all 3 of my kids - all agree that it does not hurt and one has straight, medium length thick hair, one has super long, curly hair and the other had thinner long hair.</li>
    <li> Good brush, but really small for adult.  Great for kids and the purse.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic hair brush.  It works well with fine or thick hair and is excellent for wet or dry hair.  I love brushes that have the little plastic tips on the bristles, they&#x27;re much more comfortable and it can feel like a little massage for your head.</li>
    <li> Love all the Phillips brushes.  They last a long time!</li>
    <li> the best brush I have ever owned. I am thrilled to have found them here.  I have used this brand for 15 plus years.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush, I have had several in the past and they lasted a very long time.  I had a hard time finding them here and was excited to finally find them at Amazon.</li>
    <li> This brush is literally heaven! It goes through any tangles, without yanking on your hair! Great for people with thick hair!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at such an expensive, ordinary-looking brush at first (even when I had it in my hand). It is small, but the bristles are so soft that they don&#x27;t pull the hair out, yet still get tangles out. Love it.</li>
    <li> I have used Phillips Light Touch brushes for about 30 years. I have a hard time finding them in stores, so I was very happy to see that Amazon sold them. Although I have been personally using this type of brush for many years, I only rarely need to replace them. They last years without even losing bristles. But after a while, the writing wears off the brush and it starts looking old, so I order a new one. I use the old brushes on my long-haired dogs.&lt;br /&gt;Several years ago, a dog breeder saw my brush and remarked on how it was a great design for dogs. So I now have brushes for me and brushes for my dogs. They love being groomed with these brushes and they glide nicely through their hair. Tangles come out easily. I had tried &amp;#34;dog brushes,&amp;#34; and they really did not like them. Now they look forward to being groomed.</li>
    <li> I received a Phillips Brush Light Touch 2.  The brush is clearly advertised as a Phillips Brush Light Touch 1.  The Light Touch 1 is a full size hair brush.  The Light Touch 2 is a purse size brush.</li>
    <li> The Phillips brushes are the best out there.  Your scalp gets a wonderful massage every time you brush your hair, without scratching.    I have purchased 3 brushes now...my daughter has absconded with one because even she loves it more than other brushes she has.</li>
    <li> I started using the Phillips Light Touch Brush in my early 20&#x27;s and was thrilled to see it&#x27;s still in production and available on Amazon!  Yeah!  Way better than the brushes we all find at our local Wal-Mart.  There&#x27;s only one supplier at a Salon close to our home and they never have any in-stock because they&#x27;re so popular.  Thanks to Phillips for a tough, versatile hair-brush that never disappoints!</li>
    <li> Finally replacing the one I&#x27;ve had for 15 years (!!). This is a fantastic brush.</li>
    <li> Great brush, perfect for detangling and fine hair.  Very durable and will last you for many years.  This is a replacement for same brush from over ten years ago.</li>
    <li> I always buy extra for gifts and people seem to love it too. I always have the little one in my purse and the big one at home. Even my dog uses the old one for brushing.</li>
    <li> Repeat customer for this great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for years, and could no longer find it locally.  What a terrific surprise to find it available at Amazon! It really is the best brush!I have the larger one fro my vanity and the smaller one for my purse. No tangles ever - and it massages the scalp while you brush.  Long hair, short hair, dry hair wet hair, even cranky grand daughters hair!  It&#x27;s really the best one out there.  And lasts for years before needing to replace it.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite brush for years...My entire family (extended included) use this and the larger version.  This size is perfect for your purse or travel.</li>
    <li> Just got this brush and it&#x27;s the same length as older one but much narrower . Liked the wider one better. Description have length but not width. It&#x27;s more like a child size brush . I&#x27;m keeping it as its light weight but would&#x27;ve preferred the wider, older one. These brushes do last a long time however unless you&#x27;ve got thick ,long hair .</li>
    <li> Well the brush it&#x27;s self is good, comfortable to use too, only problem is I ordered the light touch #2 and they sent me the light touch  #1 which is almost twice the size, so be careful when you order this, I thought I was going to get the light touch #2.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes they are actually the only ones I ever buy!!!! i have long hair that tangles easily and these are the only brushes that can get thru that without pulling my hair. I keep one at home, one at work and one in my gym bag</li>
    <li> good brush  easy on hair and small size great for my little girl</li>
    <li> Great item, I have used this  brand of brush for years and mine was worn out. I was so pleased to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I give my daughters a new Phillips Light Touch brush every year for Christmas. We have used this brand brush since they were little girls and am so happy I can still find them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful brush. If you have long hair or curly hair this is the one you need.&lt;br /&gt;My friend is a biker and said you have to have one of these if you&#x27;ve been riding with your hair in the wind.  It gets all the knots out without hurting your hair.</li>
    <li> If you need a good brushing, this is the brush to buy.  I think it would be phenom on long hair.  My hair is layered so it tends to flatten my hair out but I still like it.  Seller is incredible.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Phillips light touch brush at a beauty supply store over 12 years ago.  It was and is the best brush that I have ever used in my 45+ years!  I wanted to replace this brush but found that it was no longer available at my supply store.  I found it online where I immediately purchased it, (as well as the smaller, purse sized version which is also awesome). This brush is very gentle on your hair yet definitely does the job for a thick head of hair....it also washes up nicely.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Only brush I have EVER used since I have been on this earth. Im 37 and I can&#x27;t use any other brush! These are the #1brushes in the world.</li>
    <li> Really like the brush, performs well so far with no bristles falling out. Gentle on the scalp. So far wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used these brushes most of my adult life.  I buy them for my kids for Christmas.  I normally use the large one, and keep the smaller one in my purse.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hairbrush!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice small brush and very light, so it&#x27;s great for traveling.  Had the larger version for years and bought another one of those also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes since I was a little girl!! New name, but still the same great brush!¡!¡</li>
    <li> The description stated this brush was 8 1/2 inches. Well, it might be 5 inches long. Very disappointed in the size.</li>
    <li> Nice brush to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my head, and it&#x27;s just the right size.</li>
    <li> My favorite brush ever!  Light, doesn&#x27;t pull and wonderful for fine hair!</li>
    <li> Great brush - my hair is happy and so am I.</li>
    <li> As a thin-haired female, this brush is the softest, most comfortable brush for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like a lot of brushes do. The bristles have small plastic caps at the end of each which makes it soft on your scalp. If the beads/caps come off after lots of use, the bristles can be sharp! Just be careful or maybe replace when the brush gets old.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush from a hair dresser over 20 years ago and have used it every day since, but it was getting pretty worn.&lt;br /&gt;It suddenly occurred to me to look on line for the Phillips brand-which was still visible on the handle.  Thank goodness they are still being made.  I would recommend this brush to anyone who has fine hair....I use mine to blow dry my hair because it grips my fine hair to give it lift.</li>
    <li> I had one of the Phillips hair brushed for many years and finally had to thow away.  I could not find one anywhere untill I decided to do a search on the iternet.  I ordered 3 just so I would always have one.  Love the brush</li>
    <li> I had purchased this brush many years ago, probably 10 or more.  With use every day, some of the tips had come off and I panicked, thinking I&#x27;d never find another.  The name on the handle was long gone, so I didn&#x27;t even know who made the brush.  I went on line and found my little brush!!  I&#x27;m even thinking of ordering another, just for a backup!  Love, love, love it!!</li>
