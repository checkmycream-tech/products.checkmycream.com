### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I went to the hair salon which my stylist is the best and teaches color</li>
      <li>This brand is AWESOME.  </li>
      <li>but it still turned out great!</li>
      <li>The bleaching part of the kit is awesome, I wanted my hair purple</li>
      <li>But, The color is great!!</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>ALL HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL!!</li>
      <li>I was very happy with the consistency of the bleach and the dye, as well as the packaging.</li>
      <li>I ordered Splat in Lusty Lavender because it seemed perfect.</li>
      <li>Bleach worked perfectly, and the dye turned out just like on the box.</li>
      <li>This is the best purple you&#x27;re ever going to get (I can&#x27;t judge the bleach that comes with the kit).</li>
      <li>I was very happy with the outcome.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>The bleach was the best part of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>when I do it will look awesome!</li>
      <li>Over all, this hair dye is the best</li>
      <li>It already looks incredibly faded.  </li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>It came out the perfect bright purple I was wanting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Luscious Raspberries, Crimson Obsession, Lusty Lavender, and Aqua Rush; all giving me beautiful results.</li>
      <li>hair turned out wonderful and I loved it.</li>
      <li>color Lusty Lavender is also a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>On the plus side it works great as a marriage test as my husband now has purple hands, legs, and a stomach.</li>
      <li>recommend to everyone that they read the 5 star reviews and take their tips into great consideration.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;ve also tried both of Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s newer purple colors; both london lilac and velvet violet and both gave me a black-purple color that looked great, but darker than what I was looking for).</li>
      <li>By the way my husband is the one who bleached my hair and put the purple in lol</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have great results at all.</li>
      <li>The end result is incredibly purple, and it has a good depth of color.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>he would kill me if I told people that: anyhow I wash the purple out (2 bottles) and am a bit happy but also a tad upset because it wasn&#x27;t even.</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>Great color</li>
      <li>Great for college students who don&#x27;t have transport to get supplies.</li>
      <li>He was so great helping me and keeping my spirit up as he dyed my hair</li>
      <li>The best thing about these kind of colors (Splat, Color Fiend, Manic Panic) is that you don&#x27;t have to throw out the rest of the bottle if you have leftover - you can use it and use it.</li>
      <li>It worked great and looked great.</li>
      <li>I guess its great.  </li>
      <li>That was by accident but it still turned out great.</li>
      <li>You will not be happy in the end</li>
      <li>SO It worked great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really happy about it</li>
      <li>for eight bucks over the counter, it&#x27;s a great deal too.  </li>
      <li>LOL.</li>
      <li>It made my girlfriend happy, so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
      <li>But it turned out amazing!</li>
      <li>But it is perfect if you are just wanting to use as a test to make sure you like the color on you.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure your hair is perfectly squeaky-clean and un-conditioned before you apply--if it&#x27;s oily at all, the dye won&#x27;t soak in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>What a great way to get my favorite hair dye at a discounted price!</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t even hoping for a bright color, just a touch.</li>
      <li>but there was like bright purple, pinkish, and reddish colors.</li>
      <li>color is bright, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>A bright, reddish purple color, nothing like what&#x27;s on the box.  </li>
      <li>It was a bright magenta color for weeks.  </li>
      <li>The color Aqua Rush looks like a gorgeous color, however, it does not stay.</li>
      <li>The top of my hair was brilliant purple</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s at a good price, but just to let you know</li>
      <li>good quallity for the price.</li>
      <li>Bleach your hair the day before and use a good conditioner to repair it</li>
      <li>Keep the color dye on your hair a good while.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>and once you put it in, good luck getting something else in to repair the color.</li>
      <li>If you want to dye your hair, go to Sally&#x27;s and get the good stuff.</li>
      <li>ALL good hair dyes stain your skin,</li>
      <li>the dye is very beautiful and rich in Color.</li>
      <li>Special Effects is still the best colored dye in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a good 10 years now and have tried a great many colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving my hair right now! :D</li>
      <li>your best to not get the dye on your scalp as it very much does stain.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>and they worked better!</li>
      <li>Better yet, go to the salon!</li>
      <li>Make sure you rinse all the bleach out (keep your eyes covered!), then shampoo your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
      <li>But then I took a shower, washed my hair just one more time, and POOF!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you use a towel that you don&#x27;t mind having bright stains all over.</li>
      <li>It fades amazingly.</li>
      <li>The bleach that the kit comes with was amazing and didn&#x27;t go away.</li>
      <li>amazing</li>
      <li>Oh ladies, my God watch youtube and get a good shampoo and conditioner and take vitamins and lots of water to keep it healthy.</li>
      <li>The purple dye is of a watery inky substance, if you have any kind of length you will need two boxes.</li>
      <li>I have been doing my own hair for over 15 years</li>
      <li>I liked it still though.</li>
      <li>Color was GORGEOUS but splotchy, ok, user error, no problem.</li>
      <li>and you just won&#x27;t know that kind of information till you&#x27;re standing in front of the mirror...     </li>
      <li>I feel like if the bleaching kit had the brush, it would&#x27;ve been an easier process to do my own hair.</li>
      <li>I have increased the # of stars from 2 to 4 because their rep was so kind and helpful.</li>
      <li>Since I have never dyed my hair on my own like this</li>
      <li>I know how to dye my own hair; have been for years.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not going to take the time to learn how to use this product effectively</li>
      <li>I was really impressed by the color after I dyed it, but after maybe three days it started to really fade.</li>
      <li>Another thing I&#x27;ve learned over the years with these kind of colors is that if the bottle says to leave in for 30 minutes, leave it in for 60.</li>
      <li>and you just won&#x27;t know that kind of information till you&#x27;re standing in front of the mirror...</li>
      <li>(DO NOT USE A NICE TOWEL)</li>
      <li>This purple washes out really quickly for me but while it&#x27;s in it is a beautiful color.</li>
      <li>it fades quickly, and the color always drop off, but it is very beautiful and special</li>
      <li>For the price of one application, it&#x27;s a very easy way to keep this color in continuously.</li>
      <li>Now, that I know I love it, I will be getting a more permanent hair dye!</li>
      <li>I was drawn to the beautiful purple color on the box, because that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> While the color of this hair dye is vibrant, it doesn&#x27;t last. My daughter has had two applications of this particular brand. One in an actual salon and one at home, neither laster more than one week.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for almost ten years now and I have never NOT used Manic Panic.  I decided to maybe change it up a little and I bought a box of this.  I was drawn to the beautiful purple color on the box, because that&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few tips, from a first time user:&lt;br /&gt;1- the bleach doesn&#x27;t work that well.  I spent five minutes mixing it, and it still turned out spotty.  My hair is naturally a medium brown color and kind of dense, and it bleaches super easily, but using the included bleach it came out a coppery orange color.&lt;br /&gt;2- The color I got was more of a pink-y purple color, a more vibrant and less dusty dark purple&lt;br /&gt;3- I&#x27;ve been doing this for years and my color is ALWAYS even and not streaky, but this turned out super streaky&lt;br /&gt;4- It dyes skin WAY better than it dyes hair, and is super hard to wash off.&lt;br /&gt;5- Even if you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll need it, buy two boxes.  You&#x27;ll need two boxes.  Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad look, and I like it a lot, it&#x27;s just NOWHERE near what I was going for.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, so I can&#x27;t offer any opinion on how quickly it washes out, but It seems like it&#x27;s not going anywhere.</li>
    <li> The color Aqua Rush looks like a gorgeous color, however, it does not stay. When washing it out, even with cold water and no soap, it doesn’t take, except to stain some bits green. The only positive is it bleaches out easily.&lt;br /&gt;The color Lusty Lavender is also a beautiful color. This one takes to the hair and stays for a few washes. When it does fade, which is quite fast, it is very difficult to remove. Bleaching it only turns it into a neon pink. After that, no other color will cover it without turning purple again, even orange.</li>
    <li> I used this product a few days ago. I did everything the instructions told me to do, and I ended up with a complete mess. Some areas were super dark purple, some were this hideous orange/pink color. And my scalp got stained really badly. Anyway it was so bad I had to go to a salon and get it fixed for 150 dollars I don&#x27;t have! And my hair is so dry and dead now after multiple bleachings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this dye is NOT semi permanent. After one wash, it turned out to be this sickly pink color, but the pink wouldn&#x27;t come out, no matter what the hair stylist did. The colour will fade, but it won&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use this dye again. Poor quality, and horrible looking color.</li>
    <li> I used the Lusty Lavender hair dye. If you do not know what you&#x27;re doing, ask someone who does to help you out. My mom used to work in a hair salon so she knew what she was doing, and my hair came out great.&lt;br /&gt;Rather than slopping the bleach onto my hair and letting it sit for 10-30 minutes, I combed more and more through my hair for ~30 minutes, making it sure it was wet the whole time. I wound up doing that twice, because the first time I didn&#x27;t put enough in the back near my neck or on the hairline in the front of my head. After bleaching twice, I had a fairly light blonde color. Make sure you rinse all the bleach out (keep your eyes covered!), then shampoo your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Next, with the dye, I did the same thing with combing it in. Apply it liberally. If you have long hair, you might need two boxes. Make sure the parts you want dyed are totally saturated. After I did that, I let it stay in my hair for an hour and a half. IGNORE what the box says about keeping it in half an hour. Seriously, the longer you keep it in the better. After the time passed, I rinsed the dye out with cool water, and then shampoo&#x27;d my hair again. The water came out clear after a couple of minutes. Again, cover your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use petroleum jelly to cover my neck, ears, or forehead, but you probably should. It stained in places, I got the majority of it off with windex (yeah, seriously, it works. that&#x27;s what they use in hair salons sometimes too). It WILL stain. It&#x27;s hair dye. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Don&#x27;t wear anything you care about, lay plastic down in your sink/shower/whatever. It&#x27;ll probably stain your scalp. It came off of mine the first time I shampoo&#x27;d it again. It WILL eventually come off, don&#x27;t panic.&lt;br /&gt;When you shower, I suggest washing your hair with cold/cool water. The colder you can stand the better. Then, when you&#x27;re doing washing your hair, put on a shower cap and then you can use warm/hot water.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is really vibrant purple. It&#x27;s comparable to the color of Rarity&#x27;s mane in My Little Pony, haha.</li>
    <li> Before I used Splat I had bleached my hair and tried using another purple product. Didn&#x27;t work. The top of my hair was brilliant purple but the rest was hardly purple. One almost midnight run to Walmart later, Splat redeemed my hair and made it pretty. I ended up re-bleaching part of my hair and redyeing it, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Now my hair is purple but with some pinkish streaks that really add dimension. I absolutely love it. Splat worked wonders on my hair. I will definitely do this again!</li>
    <li> when i recieved it the package was all wet and the box inside was busted it was the peroxide that leaked out everywhere. I found they sell it at a local store so i will not be ordering it from online any longer.</li>
    <li> The packaging makes it look like it will be a deep royal violet, but the color was more like magenta. And that is after bleaching first and dyeing multiple times. I&#x27;m pretty picky about what shades of purple I like, and it&#x27;s frustrating when the box looks right but the real color does not. But, I guess that&#x27;s what happens when they photoshop the model&#x27;s hair instead of actually dyeing it.</li>
    <li> The first time I got this I had to go to Walgreens, I was a little worried because of the other reviews with it not working or it turning pink but it turned out even better than I thought. I have medium length hair and I got 2 boxes but the bleach wasn&#x27;t enough but it still turned out great! It is kind of messy but if you take your time then there is no problem just cover your floor with plastic wrap or a trash bag and make sure you cover the sink too. This did not stain my tub and only stained the towel the first three rinses but that&#x27;s ok because as with any hair dye you should always use a old towel and it does help if you use a hair dryer. It also runs every time I clean it, but after the first 3 washes or so it doesn&#x27;t run as much. The first time I used this I only let the dye set for maybe 45min. This time I am going to have this as an all day task just to see what happens. This time I got 3 boxes so there is extra bleach and I should have dye left over so I can redo the roots later. I also recommend going to Wal-mart to see if they have it because I paid $9.99 at Walgreens and today I went into Wal-mart and they just got this in for $8.92 its only a dollar cheaper but its the same thing and I was already there so there was no point in me going to the Walgreens. Overall I do recommend this hair dye and I hope this helps!</li>
    <li> Never again will I buy this hair dye. Ever, ever, ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I went to HEB (a local grocery store) and bought Splat in hopes of getting my hair purple. In fact, I bought two boxes of Splat because I&#x27;d done a small amount of research prior to buying it and many people had complaints that the amount of bleach given in the box was too little and being I don&#x27;t have a pixie cut and rather have hair to my shoulders- I wasn&#x27;t going to risk half-a**ing the dye job by not putting the correct amount of bleach to cover my head and get it to the level they asked for in the box&#x27;s instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Well, I bleached my hair as the instructions ordered and got to the actual dying process. While dying my hair, two drops of purple fell onto the bathroom tile and were quite quick to stain it. I used all sorts of things to try and clean it off, even the shower-cleaning agents the Splat company&#x27;s Myspace representative said to use. Finally after tons of scrubbing, it went from dark purple to a super light pink which wasn&#x27;t nearly as noticeable. Now for the staining, I don&#x27;t hold that against Splat in the least since after all, that&#x27;s the idea of the hair dye- you WANT it to stain your hair technically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So after covering my head in not one, but TWO, bottles of hair dye, I waited extra long to have it truly stick to my hair. (Side note: I&#x27;ve come to find that MANY people who often dye their hair un-natural colors recommend to let it sit extra long.) If anything, after the tile staining I had high hopes that this hair dye would stay...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BUT BOY WAS I WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Upon finally rinsing my hair out, I looked in the mirror expecting purple and found a bright pink! It was absolutely horrendous. It looked nowhere NEAR purple. Not only that, but my hair felt incredibly gross and when touched, left my palm pink! When rinsing, the water wouldn&#x27;t even run clear, period. It was just more and more pink. The whole event was just downright terrible. I ended up having to waltz into Walgreens with this horrible hair color and get a burgundy red to color over it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hair looks great now, but certainly no thanks to Splat. I&#x27;ll never use this product again and though everyone&#x27;s hair is different with some people having hair that takes the color in and others who have hair that won&#x27;t... I&#x27;d say buy this with EXTREME caution, because you could be the latter of the two and you just won&#x27;t know that kind of information till you&#x27;re standing in front of the mirror...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Possibly in horror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like I was.this horrible hair color and get a burgundy red to color over it with.

    <li> I ordered this product hoping it would do what I wanted. The bleaching part of the kit is awesome, I wanted my hair purple and it ended up more of a pink. I&#x27;ve had it in for a week and it is washing out and fading quickly.  If your looking for something washable and Not permanent then this will work for you! If you want something permanent then this wont work,</li>
    <li> it fades quickly, and the color always drop off, but it is very beautiful and special</li>
    <li> It is a decent product for the money you pay for it, no matter that it doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair long enough. But, The color is great!! I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> It made my girlfriend happy, so that&#x27;s all that matters.</li>
    <li> Do not use unless you have blonde hair I have light brown and after leaving in for an hour I&#x27;m left with an ugly red color, on the bright side my entire body is purple, just like the box:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using splat for about five years now and I adore their darker colors. Their dark blue, purple, and dark greens come out very well and stay in foreverrrr. I applied the color in hair that had been washed the night before with no conditioner, I thoroughly worked into my hair and used a decent amount, be sure to coat your hair in the product. After applying the color I put on a shower cap and left it in for 1 1/2 hours, you may need longer if you have thicker or ethnic hair. I washed it out in ice cold water and applied conditioner, after drying it I also used a spray-on leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Splat lasts quite a long while and this particular purple fades into a bright purplish-pink.</li>
    <li> I like this dye. I didn&#x27;t use the bleach, just the purple. I&#x27;m currently redying it as I type this. It stains. Bad. Easily. It&#x27;ll stain anything it touches so for pete&#x27;s sake use some gloves and vaseline the heck out of your forehead. I&#x27;ve just been dying my bangs with this as of late on a natural medium brown color. It turns out pretty decent actually, given I didn&#x27;t use the bleach. Nothing super bright but that&#x27;s to be expected with medium natural hair. It lasted about 2 months before the very last of it washed out for me. Even as it faded it was a very pretty purple, with streaks of my natural color popping back through. I&#x27;d reccomend it.</li>
    <li> Box was smashed but the product was unharmed, however the directions were wet and unable too read.thankfully I had the directions from a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this item from wal-mart a week ago. I bleached my hair, which did everything I expected. Not complaints about the bleaching part. But when it comes to the color, dear lord, not even close. I expected a purple, or some sort of lavender. Maybe even a lilac. Nope. My hair was fushia. I wanted purple, like it looks on  the box or somewhere close, I didn&#x27;t get close to that. I got fushia, magenta color. Not only that my hair is maroon, fushia, and orange. I left the dye in for about 40 minutes, as long as it said on the instructions. And I still only got fushia. I dyed it multiple times, and it&#x27;s still not even close to purple. It&#x27;s every other pink or red variation, but not purple. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anyone looking for what&#x27;s on the box. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this. Spend it on color jamz or manic panic. I was not happy with this product at all. I honestly wish I could return it for a refund, but since it&#x27;s been open and used, I&#x27;m going to have to keep dreaming.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
    <li> washed out after 3 washes over a week. My hair&#x27;s brown, red, and kind of purple now.</li>
    <li> So I had light blonde hair, I bleached it with the Splat lightening kit. I bought extra bleach cuz I have a lot of hair. I&#x27;ve bleached my hair a few years ago and it tingled a lil but the Splat bleach burned horribly! It was as if my head was on fire! And I like to think I have a pretty high pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards the bleach turned out OK. Not the white I wanted but platinum blondish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used this \\&quot;lavender\\&quot; to do streaks to frame my face. Well it made a mess and after just a little time in my hair it turned hard. I&#x27;ve never had hair dye turn hard, like dried paint. I washed it out after the allotted time. It was kinda purple kinda pink. I left it for a 2 days unwashed, then washed it with color safe shampoo and my hair turned pink!! Like fuchsia in some spots and Barbie pink in others! Plus there are weird patches that completely washed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note about the Splat bleach. I have parts that are turning green. No I haven&#x27;t been in the pool and no I&#x27;ve never dyed my hair green/blue or even something close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible haird dye! Didn&#x27;t last a single washing. I&#x27;m so very disappointed. Not worth the money and time.</li>
    <li> I love Splat and I have been using it for over a year.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every brand of purple hair dye, and this is by far the best!  It lasts for about 4 months on my hair and then fades to a lavender that is very pretty--I like it even better than the initial color!  My natural hair color is a medium ash blonde, and I&#x27;ve never had to bleach it, the Splat just covers it right up.  I know lots of people like special effects, but this color is much stronger and lasts a lot longer, and it is very gentle on your hair without any damage or stripping.  I&#x27;ve applied Splat \\&quot;lusty lavender\\&quot; about 8 times, and here are my \\&quot;pro tips\\&quot;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The color will change in intensity depending on how much product you put in your hair during dying.  If you don&#x27;t put in enough goo, it will turn out very light.  I think the reviewers who got a pink color just didn&#x27;t use enough product.  If you use a ton of it, it will be very dark and deep.  If you use a medium amount, it will be a medium purple.  Be sure to comb it all the way through so it&#x27;s not streaky.  Buy two boxes--that way you know you will have enough, and if you have extra you can use it for root touch-ups!  Also, make sure your hair is perfectly squeaky-clean and un-conditioned before you apply--if it&#x27;s oily at all, the dye won&#x27;t soak in as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) It will stain your skin--use petroleum jelly on your ears, neck and forehead.  ALL good hair dyes stain your skin, if it&#x27;s something that soaks into your hair, it&#x27;s going to soak into your skin too. I always use latex gloves when applying and rinsing, because they fit better than the dumb plasticky gloves.  Also, put down some glad press n&#x27; seal on the bathroom counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) When you get the dye in, pin or clip your hair up and wrap your head in press n&#x27; seal.  I usually let it sit for a couple of hours.  It&#x27;s just a stain, not a developer, so it won&#x27;t fry your hair.  You could leave it in all day if you want to.  Also, don&#x27;t shampoo your hair for a week or so after you dye it, so that it has time to \\&quot;set\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) When you rinse it out, your hair will not rinse clear unless you are using cold water.  If you use warm water, the water will always be a little pink, even after a few months of shampooing, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Your towels will become purple.  As long as your hair is wet, it will stain towels, pillowcases, and your neck, but when your hair is dry it won&#x27;t stain at all.  If you sleep a little bit sweaty, it might re-hydrate the dry hair next to your face and stain your skin a little bit pink, so for the first week or so, try to keep it away from your face and neck while your sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Compared with other hair dyes I&#x27;ve used, it rinses out of the tub really easily.  If something is stained, you can dissolve the stain with an ammonia-based cleaner and give it a go with a Mr. Clean magic eraser and it will come right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) People will stare at you!  I sometimes forget that my hair is purple, and then I&#x27;m like, \\&quot;jeez, why am I getting all these weird looks?\\&quot; ;-)ou dye it, so that it has time to \\&quot;set\\&quot;.    4) When you rinse it out, your hair will not rinse clear unless you are using cold water.  If you use warm water, the water will always be a little pink, even after a few months of shampooing, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.    5) Your towels will become purple.  As long as your hair is wet, it will stain towels, pillowcases, and your neck, but when your hair is dry it won&#x27;t stain at all.

    <li> I have dyed my hair before but this was the first time I attempted to do two things a) Dye my hair an unnatural color b) actually bleach my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like Splat did the job decently enough. I have naturally jet black hair + I have natural Afro-textured hair, so I had to put the bleach in for the maximum time. Perhaps I should&#x27;ve put another round of bleach to allow my hair to get completely pale blonde in some parts but because of how pretty some of it looked, I decided not to do a second bleaching job. Also, I didn&#x27;t want my hair to get too fried. Some of my hair is a strawberry blonde now, other parts of it is a pale blonde..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my hair didn&#x27;t come out the color of the box. Well the majority of it anyway, most of it was like a reddish purple, and the sides were more towards the lusty lavender since I put more bleach on the sides for a semi ombre effect. I feel like if the bleaching kit had the brush, it would&#x27;ve been an easier process to do my own hair. However, I did enjoy the product for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the peeves I had with the product was that IT GOT ALL OVER, EVERYWHERE. If you aren&#x27;t careful, it could stain everywhere. And it&#x27;s definitely important to make sure you take all the proper precautions to make sure it doesn&#x27;t get all over. If you have afro-textured hair and it isn&#x27;t a TWA, for the love of everything that is holy, GET TWO OR EVEN THREE KITS. I almost used up most of the hair dye and I have an awkard looking twa, I could only imagine how it could for someone with more hair. Also, wash your hair with cold water and color friendly shampoo. The color is starting to fade, but it manages to look pretty.</li>
    <li> I have dirty blonde natural hair color. I used Feria platinum blonde bleach kit to get my lighter. Then I used the bleaching kit inside this one. I left the color on for 2 hours put up in a processing cap to lock it in. It worked fantastic. I have been doing my own hair for over 15 years and I have used many different kinds of extreme hair color. This one by far, worked the best! I noticed the places where I got it on my scalp, showed up darker in my hair. That was by accident but it still turned out great. I would recommend this to anyone. If you have dark hair, it will take several bleaching kits or a high developer to achieve the pale blonde you need. This has to be done weeks apart or your hair will melt and fall out. For thick hair or long hair, get two kits just to be safe because you will have to dye it twice. The colorant won&#x27;t harm hair but the bleach will. I also left the conditioner in my hair for 20 minutes, again in a processing cap. That helps bring some nutrients back in and then use a heavy hair cream to seal it in. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and it was the first time I had ever dyed my hair an unnatural color on my own. I wanted to dye the top of my hair black and dye the underside of my hair purple. Since I have never dyed my hair on my own like this (I&#x27;ve used box sets for one color but have never bleached or attempted multiple colors), I was a bit nervous. First I applied the bleach to the areas I wanted to be purple and wrapped those areas securely with tin foil, waited 30 minutes, and then I applied a semi-perm black L&#x27;oreal. Waited another 25 minutes. This allowed the black to set and also my hair to bleach PERFECTLY. I rinsed, dried up, and then applied the purple dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dye is not like regular dyes. It is very concentrated. It will GET EVERYWHERE. And stain everything. I was not prepared. Also, leaving it in for the 25 minutes that it stated in the instructions was not enough time at all. When I rinse it after 30 minutes, the color was more pink I had missed a lot of my hair. But! The great thing is since this is not like regular dyes, I just did a do-ever. I wasn&#x27;t aware that this dye actually doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, or I would&#x27;ve left it in longer. I reapplied the dyes to the now pink strands of hair and waited another 30 minutes. This time the color came out BEAUTIFULLY VIBRANT. But oh my god, was it everywhere, and if it touches you, it will STAIN you for days. Not like other boxed colors where you can wash it would pretty easily. This stuff will stick on your skin. I think I spent 2 hours dying my hair and 4 hours getting it off my skin with very minimal progress. So be very, very careful. Get extra gloves. You will stain every towel you&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair turned out wonderful and I loved it. But the color didn&#x27;t stick and after a few washes, it had dulled pretty heavily. Still looked nice though, but rinses out quickly. Later found out I should have left it in longer since it is not a developer. I also found out you can keep the dye for touch ups without damaging your hair so your color will remain vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to do this again, I would leave it in MUCH, much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was nice about this color was that even though it stained me ridiculously, it didn&#x27;t stain my bathroom or tub at all. All the purple rinsed away with ease. Now if only I could say the same about my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Be careful with the dye.&lt;br /&gt;2) Don&#x27;t be afraid to leave it in longer or reapply until you get your desired affects. I mean, literally leave it in for hours.&lt;br /&gt;3) You must bleach your hair for the dye to stick whatsoever. Seems most negative reviews had people who didn&#x27;t want to bleach and were unsatisfied with the results.  To put it in perspective, I dyed my hair black at the same time as I bleached my hair and when I applied the purple I applied a lot of it to the recently-colored black strands because I was having a difficult time separating my hair without accidentally separating the blond. This color did not touch my black hair AT ALL. When I reapplied it, I noticed this, and pretty much slathered the purple dye everywhere with no regards to the black. It didn&#x27;t change the color of my black hair what so ever. This just shows you how big of a difference bleaching is. If you&#x27;re not going to bleach, don&#x27;t even bother.&lt;br /&gt;4) Save the remaining dye for touch ups :)I wish I did that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a very time consuming dye process, mostly because I was inexperienced with bleach and dying unnatural colors. You have to really make sure you get that purple ALL OVER the parts of the hair you want colored. Don&#x27;t be afraid to get it on non-bleached parts of your hair in the process. It won&#x27;t stick at all so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Use a lot of the product and let it sit for as long as you can stand it. Be prepared with tinfoil, extra gloves, bands, clips, and other equipment. Also be prepared to stain everything if you get your hair wet. I worked out and I stainedmy work out shirt with the color leakage, so you have to be very aware of when it&#x27;s wet. Make sure it&#x27;s completely dry after you shower or else you&#x27;ll stain everything. But it&#x27;s worth it. I got so many compliments and people didn&#x27;t believe that I colored it myself. I&#x27;ll take a couple of stained towels for a bright, vibrant color!</li>
    <li> I have dyed my hair just about every color there is. I have tried many, many hair colors plus food coloring and kool-ade, but SPLAT is by far my favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last color I experimented with was Purple.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was bleached to a light blonde color. And I used a \\&quot;brass banisher\\&quot; to remove the bright yellow look.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Raw color: lasted only about a week, and it was more on the blue side than I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Manic Panic Amplified: that was awful! It made my hair this muddy, ashy, violet, puke color!&lt;br /&gt;Finally I used SPLAT lusty lavender, thinking at least it would be better than the nasty color the others had turned my hair. But it turned out amazing! I have been using SPLAT ever since!&lt;br /&gt;It is a more red based purple that is gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, So here are my tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Get 2 boxes! To make sure you have enough and you have some extra in case you missed a spot or need to do a root touch-up later. Also get some vinyl gloves, they work better than the ones provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Bleach your hair the day before and use a good conditioner to repair it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Wash your hair with some dish soap. Sounds strange, but you need to remove all the oils from your hair and nothing cuts grease better than dish soap. Use a quarter sized amount of dish soap and a quarter sized amount of your regular shampoo and make sure you get your roots well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. This stuff stains very well, so cover everything! I like to put an old damp towel on the edge of the counter around the sink so when you are picking up your mirror, comb, and tint brush and setting them down you don&#x27;t get purple  fingerprints on your counter and sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. The usual wear gloves and protect your clothing, for your skin use petroleum jelly (or jam if you prefer :P)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Really saturate your hair with the dye. If you use too little your hair will turn out more pink than purple. Be very careful about getting it on your scalp it will be there for a long time! Cover your hair with a shower-cap or a small plastic bag. If you let the dye dry out, it will be less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Leave the dye in for 1 to 6 hours, this will ensure that the dye really penetrates the hair follicle and makes it last longer. It does not have the chemical composition of a permanent dye so it is safe to leave in for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Rinse with cool water and use a good conditioner. Hot water will fade the color faster. Try not to shampoo your hair for a day or two after dying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. My secret weapon against stains? If you got some dye on your skin use some NOXZEMA Anti-blemish pads! They have salicylic acid in them which removes the dye and the texture of the pads are great for scrubbing really soaked in dye! Works every time without fail! Even if the dye is days old!&lt;br /&gt;As for your counter-top, floor, sink, walls and bathtub? Get some 409 and start scrubbing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. When you do shampoo your hair use a shampoo with a low detergent content such as baby shampoo or at least a phosphate free shampoo. Forget about \\&quot;color preserving\\&quot; shampoo it still strips the color out, sometimes even faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. As with most dyes it will stain your pillowcases and collar for a few days after you dye it so be careful with wet hair! Wear black and sleep with a towel under your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up for me is BLUE ENVY!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all I got. Have fun! :)will be there for a long time!

    <li> After bleaching hair and allowing color to set it turned out more pink than lavender and the color continued to fade with each wash so that it ended up pink, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This crap is so pigmented! I love it. It fades amazingly. However, keep in mind that for the first few washes, this dye will stain every pillow you&#x27;ve ever owned! I suggest investing in a purple pillowcase or a white pillowcase that you&#x27;ve always wanted to purple Rorschach up! Definitely has great staying power, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I loved the color when I first did it and even more when it began to fade to pink.  The only issue is that it bleeds a lot when you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff stains everything and fades to weird colors, it also rubs off easily, so i wouldnt use light colored towels, pillow cases, or wear light shirts (if you have longer hair) for about three weeks after first applying it</li>
    <li> My friend wanted me to dye his hair for him but he was on a budget. We went to walmart and found splat. I was leery at first because it was a 10 dollar hair dye AND bleach kit. I mean i&#x27;ve always heard you get what you pay for when it comes to beauty products. We picked up the Blue envy and went to my house to dye it. Bleach worked perfectly, and the dye turned out just like on the box. It worked great and looked great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different hair color and this washed out within 3 washes. It quickly turned from a lovely violet color to light lavender to light pink. I was very disappointed. The bleach kit worked really well though. That almost made it worth the money, but, overall, it was messy and I had to clean out my bathtub after every shower because the color ran so profusely.</li>
    <li> So I really like the dye... But it&#x27;s NOTHING like the color on the box. It&#x27;s more of a real purple color than a lavender. I was expecting something different. Luckily I am cool with it, if I was pickier I would&#x27;ve been furious.</li>
    <li> Color isn&#x27;t holding.  The stuff is very messy, even for hair dye, but my main issue is that after a week, it bleeds pretty horribly when you shower.  Ruined a towel drying off today.  Can&#x27;t imagine the mess it would make in a swimming pool.  Then as someone said...good for the first 2 inches of hair.  So after a week, it is dark near the scalp, but not purple in the other areas.</li>
    <li> Not happy. The item came all wet because of the 1 application spilt all in side. I would like another kit sent</li>
    <li> I normally color with Color Jam from Sally&#x27;s but bought the Lusty Lavender Splat on a whim. At first I was very hesitant to use it figuring the pedestrian accessibility of the dye (ie Walgreens) would mean an inferior product but luckily that was not the case at all. My hair is a My Little Pony swirl of purple and white and I was able to get a vibrant dark purple that has lasted several weeks without staining the white portions of my hair during washes. It is slowly fading to a pinkish violet vs the dingy blue I was worried I would be left with. Comparatively I think Splat has stood up better then many of the Color Jam shades I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things to note when using this product or really any vibrant dye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. IT STAINS...that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Keep it from getting on things you don&#x27;t want stained including but not limited to: scalp, face, hands, counter top, towels, floor, clothes...&lt;br /&gt;2. You can protect your skin by applying vasoline. Wear gloves to protect your hands when applying dye.If you are only dying part of your hair cover it in tin foil while you wait.&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure to comb or massage in the dye so you don&#x27;t miss portions that have clumped together&lt;br /&gt;4. The longer you leave the dye the more vibrant it will be. The color from a 20 minute application will not last as long as several hours of application. There is no developer in the purple dye so it will not damage your hair to leave it in&lt;br /&gt;5. The dye will continue to leak small amounts after subsequent washing but it can be minimized by rinsing in cold water and blowing dry.&lt;br /&gt;6. Lighten you hair before applying dye if you want vibrant effects even if you are already blond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And last have reasonable expectations of the product. Many of the negative reviews I have seen for this product are from people who are dying their hair for the first time and made some mistakes that would have been experienced with any colored dye. If you are wondering if Splat will perform in line with the other products out there the answer is an unqualified YES.out there the answer is an unqualified YES.</li>
    <li> I used the pink splat. I have blonde hair so I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair before putting the color in. I have now had pink highlights for 5 months now and it is still as vibrant as day one. I used the bleach to do other highlights in my hair and the bleached highlights are still just the same as day one. I wash my hair every other day and it hasn&#x27;t fades out at all.</li>
    <li> My friends and I tried this product, and it was terrible. All of them turned out different shades of purple/pink and made it look way too bright when it was supposed to be a dark purple. We will never use splat again.</li>
    <li> .....because that&#x27;s all the purple I got from this. First, the bleach. My hair is dark, dark brown, so I left the bleach in for an hour, just like the little chart on the instructions said. While it was in, my scalp was itchy beyond belief. After I washed it out and dried it, my hair was a sort of caramely color, no where near the white-ish blonde I heard it was supposed to be. So I thought, \\&quot;Hey, it&#x27;ll look better after the purple, right?\\&quot; Wrong. It may have just been operator error, but after the leaving the color in for half an hour (again, just like the chart said), I washed it out and only about the first inch of my roots was the bright purple I wanted, and the rest was an unappealing (to me at least) purpleish pink with patches of the caramely color showing through. So I put everything that was left in the bottle (about half)on it again, waited another half an hour, and go something that seemed a little more promising when I washed it out again. There was much more of the purple color this time, and I thought I was saved. But then I took a shower, washed my hair just one more time, and POOF! the color was back to how it was after the first dye, if not a little worse. Needless to say, I wasn&#x27;t pleased.   So, the only good thing I can say about my experience with this dye is that it washed out of my bathtub fairly well. That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m going to try something else to try to fix the horrible mess my hair has become.</li>
    <li> Left the color in for half an hour. Stained my skin purple and my hair a weird shade of pink... :(</li>
    <li> I used the bleach power with my own developer (clairol 30) on my dyed black hair and ultimately got it to brassy blonde after a few applications. After shampooing my hair I used the dye and left it in my hair for roughly an hour. I rinsed it out in the shower with lukewarm water and waited for the water to run clear as directed. After about 15 minutes the dye was still bleeding profusely even after conditioning so I just got out. (DO NOT USE A NICE TOWEL) I used an old tee to dry it and let it air dry-the whole shirt was stained. After it dried, it was a very pinky-purple and the little orange was showing. Each day it just got uglier so I applied it again after shampooing, and it looked like it had before. It bled like hell all over and stained my hands pink whenever I touched it. The bleach was the best part of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would instead recommend punky colours purple dyes. After two weeks it now looks like the splat dye did on day one. It doesn&#x27;t take well on my roots but the color overall stays true. My hair smelled like grape Gatorade for the first week and only bleeds a little with color-safe shampoo. After a week I can use a towel instead of that shirt on my hair confidently.</li>
    <li> The color is very vibrant. The bottle says it will last six weeks - lasted seriously about 6 months for me (and yes, I wash my hair!). Not only did it last 6 months of normal use, I had to use a color remover AND bleach it twice to get it out! (By the way, color remover smells worse than anything. Don&#x27;t use Clairol color remover.) If you aren&#x27;t ready to really commit to this color, you&#x27;re better off with another brand. This is truly a STAIN. It will stain your hair, and it will stain your scalp.... Seriously, it will take FOREVER to get it off of your skin. You can use Vaseline on your forehead, ears, and neck, and have a friend to help you with a comb, for your scalp, or it will be a nightmare.   The other shades of Splat didn&#x27;t last as long, but always longer than the box says.     Splat (as well as most other unnatural colored hair colors) is safe for your hair (no ammonia!), and okay to use riiight after dying.     The color is very vibrant. I have used 3 shades (this purple, blue, and red), and they have very great color. If you don&#x27;t want something as vibrant, you can tone it down by mixing it with hair conditioner (not 2-in-1 of course! Only conditioner) in a cup or another bottle.     Another thing, it&#x27;s a pain to wash off in the shower when first coloring it. It seems to take forever and ever for the water to run even almost clear, and it is a mess.     The best thing about these kind of colors (Splat, Color Fiend, Manic Panic) is that you don&#x27;t have to throw out the rest of the bottle if you have leftover - you can use it and use it. Mixing with conditioner will tone it down (depending on how much you use), and make the bottle last longer. That&#x27;s what I do and the color is still vibrant.    Another thing I&#x27;ve learned over the years with these kind of colors is that if the bottle says to leave in for 30 minutes, leave it in for 60. It won&#x27;t damage your hair at all! As long as it stays moist (try a shower cap), it will keep on working.     The bleach in thiskit.... I didn&#x27;t have great results at all. I&#x27;d suggest buying different hair bleach.</li>
    <li> The red is great for fake blood in Halloween&lt;br /&gt;Also dyed my hair without the bleach&lt;br /&gt;And just bleached the tips of my hair&lt;br /&gt;Resulting in a darker shade of red and red tips&lt;br /&gt;Yeah sure it stains, wash your hands with alcohol or bleach&lt;br /&gt;I used my perfume since it seems to take it out perfectly&lt;br /&gt;The only problem you have now is you can&#x27;t sit anywhere&lt;br /&gt;You will stain the pillow or couch&lt;br /&gt;Specially if it&#x27;s hot and you start sweating&lt;br /&gt;Big no no&lt;br /&gt;I saved my bottle for a year now still works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair by myself for years and years, and I have never ever had as bad of an experience with a hair color as I did with this one. I knew going in that it was not going to be a quick process. I read the instructions and followed them exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY short. 4 inches at the longest point. I used the entire bottle of purple. There are places that I know were covered that the dye &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t take&amp;#34;. Parts of my hair are a nice purple color like on the box, the rest of it is bright pink. Magenta pink. I left the color on for the additional 30 minutes that it says to for thick hair and it still looks horrible. I could not imagine using two boxes of product on my hair that is four inches long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have to figure out what I can use to cover over the top. I will never use a Splat product again.</li>
    <li> This product provides very vibrant colour, but only for a few days. It washes out exceptionally quickly, and I would find purple splotches on my sheets from where it had bled out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this is a good product, and it comes with all the necessary accouterments, e.g. hair bleach (necessary for me, as I have dark brown hair) and clear, concise instructions as well as dye bottles and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for vibrant, fun, short-term colour, this product is for you, but beware potential mess.</li>
    <li> Great product, only bleached my ends because i was afraid it would damage my hair, which it did in the spots i did bleach, but it was a beautiful dark purple on the spots that werent bleached and faded into a bright pink/purple color. love this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dyeing my hair for 15 years, I know how to dye my hair. Nothing before has been such a messy experience. There wasn&#x27;t enough bleach in the kit to do more than my bangs and the dye stained EVERYTHING. My scalp is still purple where a bit dripped, two weeks later. It runs out every time it rains or I sweat and I&#x27;m looking forward to it wearing off.</li>
    <li> Okay so. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with splat a number of times, and while my hair is naturally dark and requires 2 bleach kits, the color is amazing. Never have I had to redye parts of it. Never have I had such vibrant, long lasting results (I&#x27;ve tried Ion, Special Effects, Manic panic, salon mixed colors-nothing works this well) It&#x27;s long lasting, a little messy (USE DARK TOWELS) and like I said, double bleaching is a pain, but the results are worth the fuss. ESPECIALLY if you have thick hair. No other dye does it quite right.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this product from my local Rite-Aid.  I had my friend help me with this because I&#x27;m not experienced with dying my hair at all.  I have medium to dark brown hair, so we had to let the bleach sit in for nearly an hour.  Not only did the bleach burn something horribly, but it didn&#x27;t work well at all.  My hair was really pale looking and then turned orange after washing and drying it (as per instructions).  I had to go to bed soon but I couldn&#x27;t go to work with nasty orange hair so we put in the dye and we let it sit in for about an hour, as per instructions.  For whatever reason it didn&#x27;t stick to some parts of my hair? It came out with random blonde spots.  Not to mention, it stains EVERYTHING. I&#x27;ve had my hair &#x27;purple&#x27; for a while now, and it&#x27;s still washing out in the shower.  Most of it is faded and now my hair is brown, orange, blonde and reddish purple splotchy coloured.       [...]  [...]    I can tell that some of it is gonna stick in but I can&#x27;t even dye over it or bleach it again to fix it so I&#x27;m stuck with this until my hair grows out and I can chop it off.  I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong or something, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone else.  I&#x27;ve heard that the Manic Panic or w/e from Hot Topic is much better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Special Effects, Manic Panic, or Punky Colors. I was in a rush to just get it done but I was out of dye, so I picked this stuff up from the store because it was all that was available. I&#x27;ve dyed my hair countless times with various dyes and know how to make them last- I&#x27;ve never had one start noticeably fading even a little in less than a week (if it wasn&#x27;t great dye) even though I still shampoo my hair carefully with natural shampoo (because my hair gets intolerably gross if I don&#x27;t wash it daily), usually with Special Effects or Punky Colors it lasts looking good for at least a month or so. I shampoo without conditioning, dry, then leave the dye in for a minimum of 4 hours before carefully rinsing out and only scrubbing my scalp to get the dye off of it for the first day or two before shampooing it all. I don&#x27;t bleach my hair because I have ash blonde hair and prefer the dark color I get when I dye on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this dye, my color started very noticeably fading after the first time I washed it. It&#x27;s fading at different rates in different places which it&#x27;s never done before. About 5 washes later and half of my hair is back to its original color, the parts that are purple are very faded. It also seemed to stay on my scalp for unusually long. I would definitely not recommend this product at all and I will be going back to the top brands right away.</li>
    <li> Worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s a bit lighter than it shows, but than again, I had a lighter blue-ish in my hair and once I used the lightener it lightened it even more. But I&#x27;ve had it for like a week or so, and it&#x27;s staying in and I&#x27;m getting tons of compliments! I had never used Splat before, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised it I ended up using it again!</li>
    <li> Very fun for subtle or all over color. Be very careful with contact to skins and fabrics this goes especially for your scalp!</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair with Garnier Nutrisse hair color for a couple of years now, and during my firsts weeks at college I decided it was time for a hair-change as I saw this on the shelf while I was picking up my usual color. When the time comes to use it, I start with the hair lightening kit that comes with the color. As my hair was rather dark before hand, I don&#x27;t fault it for not getting the color as light as I would have liked it, but like I said, that was fine. I figured my hair was light enough for the color so a couple of days later I follow the instructions and really saturate my hair with the stuff. ~65 minutes go by and here&#x27;s where the fun starts.&lt;br /&gt;First; This stuff takes forever to wash out adequately! I know I used a lot, but it took me about 11 goes with the shampoo and an exorbitant amount of time for the water to run even mostly clear.&lt;br /&gt;Second; The color wasn&#x27;t even in the slightest and nowhere has it really set in but closer to my roots! So my hair is many varying shades of pink, yellow, and purple (my previous color was a purplish red) which isn&#x27;t bad per se, but definitely not what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too late did I learn from other people who have used this brand that it sucked for them, too.&lt;br /&gt;Ah well, at least it&#x27;s only hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different Splat colors, and they&#x27;re all perfect. Last long, good stuff. Just got my Lavender in the mail today. Box sealed, everything&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;Few tips for people new to Splat:&lt;br /&gt;1. IT IS A DIRECT PIGMENT COLOR AND IT WILL STAIN STUFF. Be really REALLY careful of where you dye your hair and where you rinse it out. If you get it on your skin, unless you know good remedies to get dye off things, expect it to be there a few days.&lt;br /&gt;2. Whenever you wash it, yes, the color will bleed gradually. That is to be expected. While your hair is some fun color, pick a towel that you don&#x27;t care for and use it exclusively to dry your hair after you rinse/shower from here on out.&lt;br /&gt;3. Keep the color dye on your hair a good while. I usually leave it in for more than an hour. Use a shower cap, or tie a plastic grocery bag around your head. This will help your hair in taking the dye, plus an extra step in preventing a mess.&lt;br /&gt;4. SPECIAL NOTE: should you decide you don&#x27;t like it and want to change it back, I&#x27;ve heard of people trying to use a product called &amp;#34;Color Oops&amp;#34;. It rinses out the colors in in your hair that have been deposited by dyes. THIS DOES NOT WORK ON DIRECT PIGMENTS LIKE SPLAT. It works on other kinds of box dyes. So, if you don&#x27;t like whatever color you use from Splat, you&#x27;ll just have to dye your hair a dark color and hope that colors covers what you did, or try and bleach it, which will probably suck. So be careful and color wisely! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good seller, great product, definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Totally fried my hair :( I suggest anyone buying this product also buy a color intense treatment to go with it so you can apply after the bleach is washed out. It&#x27;s really time consuming when you have long dark hair. Bad for brunettes but awesome for blondes. (if your hair is already light, no need to use the bleach)</li>
    <li> I came across splat on a random trip to Wal-Mart. I&#x27;m always looking for new purples to try out. I picked up splat thinking what the hell I need a touch up anyways. When I first opened the box I was a little upset to find a small vial of purple dye. my hair is already bleached to a pale yellow so I can&#x27;t vouch for the quality of the Bleaching process. The purple dye is of a watery inky substance, if you have any kind of length you will need two boxes. If you&#x27;re just touching up you can comb it through and it will add some dimension to your already colored hair. Of all of the dyes I&#x27;ve ever used, this one stained my skin the worse. Try not to get it on your scalp it took a Clorox wipe to get it off in desperation. I did not like how much it &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; if you get caught In The rain or accidentally get your hair wet. Expect to have purple streaks running down your face and on your clothes. The color is pretty vibrant but you can get a better quality dye that doesn&#x27;t run off so easily.</li>
    <li> Pretty good for the price point. Not a permanent color and comes out on bedding or clothes if your sweat or get your hair wet. Leaving the color on for a VERY LONG TIME under a shower cap while going about the rest of your day is the best way to get good color saturation; following the instructions on the box resulted in not so great color that washed out really fast, but leaving it on for hours on end to get the saturation up left color that lasted for weeks before I felt like it needed to be redone.</li>
    <li> I was tremendously excited to try this after having seen several people with amazing Splat-dyed hair at ComiCon.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my hair apparently wants no part of bleach or purple dye!  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a bunch of research before trying this, and followed all the instructions carefully. I was very happy with the consistency of the bleach and the dye, as well as the packaging. The kit was easy to use, cleaner than some I&#x27;ve tried, and the times suggested for bleaching &amp; dying were completely reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One round of bleach was not enough to sufficiently or evenly strip my (naturally medium brown) hair, but further bleaching resulting in looking like a derelict barbie doll! Despite not naturally having any red in it, my hair bleached down to a reddish blonde and wouldn&#x27;t budge any farther. The purple looks amazing in the few spots that it actually took, but large parts of my hair barely took any purple dye at all, despite having been bleached and my careful following of the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly, it looked pretty bad, but having spent almost 10 hours on the process from start to finish (large chunks of that time being the required blow-drying to complete dryness between every step) there wasn&#x27;t much else I could do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye does wash out quickly whenever it comes in contact with water at all, but that has actually worked in my favor as it is evening out, and becoming more of a berry shade with blends less obnoxiously with the parts of my hair that are still mysteriously reddish blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergo, my tips for others are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have not used this before, consider getting a professional or thoroughly experienced friend to help you in case you too end up needing to do some trouble shooting mid-way through the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If your hair is not already blonde, seriously consider sticking to the darker colors (blue/red) that will still show without bleaching, or buy an extra lightening bleach kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Have a backup plan, and give yourself lots of time to both do this and to potentially fix it before any important dates/events, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanted to love this, but won&#x27;t be using it again.br /&gt;3.

    <li> I gave this hair dye 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it yet. But I&#x27;m sure when I do it will look awesome! I have to get some more courage to make this bold statement.</li>
    <li> What a great way to get my favorite hair dye at a discounted price! Great for college students who don&#x27;t have transport to get supplies. Same product as in stores but cheaper</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair with this kit and I love it. I am a brunette with honey highlights so the dye took differently to different sections of my hair, also I didn&#x27;t lighten or bleach my hair at all. I JUST USED THE DYE NOT EVEN THE INCLUDED LIGHTENING KIT. Overall I really love the product I have long wavy hair so two bottles were needed. Here&#x27;s a photo of it dyed, I haven&#x27;t shampooed it yet but I have conditioned it twice. Also be sure to get all your strands, my brown shows through so be careful of that.</li>
    <li> I loved how the color looked in my hair but its been about two and half weeks and my ends are nearly completely faded. The top sides of m hair still look nice and purple but the bottom is faded to a barely there pink in the blonde parts of my hair and the rest looks like my typical brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;This is what it looked like right after it was done.&lt;br /&gt;http://s3.photobucket.com/user/Mehlenna/media/10492384_10204197674880524_1712081034113081444_n1.jpg.html</li>
    <li> This is the  first time I&#x27;ve tried Splat, and I have to say I&#x27;m pleased. I used the color Lusty Lavender and love the way it came out. &#x27; Of course as with any semi-permanent hair dye it&#x27;s fading pretty quickly, but it is fading into a pretty pinkish purple. It&#x27;s always a plus for it to fade to a pretty color rather than something dull and not so pretty. Yes, the color did stain my pillowcase and some articles of clothing, but nothing major. Going solely off of my own experience this is an overall great semi-permanent hair dye.</li>
    <li> If you like to change your hair color this is not the product for you. Ive tried everything to get this out for over 7 months now and its still in there. I went to the hair salon which my stylist is the best and teaches color and she said she hasn&#x27;t seen anything like this. She bleached it and it actually got a brighter color. (bleach shouldn&#x27;t do that). I have tried just about every product out there as far as hair color and this is the worst. It you are sure you want the same color forever and don&#x27;t wanna change it I guess its great.  When I did it in the first place it took a week to get off my moms hand since she did it and it went through the glove and then she had to peal it off.</li>
    <li> More specifically, avoid following the timing instructions for the color. I, and 2 friends, split a bottle to color segments of our hair. My best advice is keep it on for at LEAST an hour; 30 minutes will leave you with a bright pink!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I can say the dye is very gentle; it didn&#x27;t damage my VERY fine, BLEACHED hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from a medium/dark dyed brown, to blonde (which looked your standard barbie-fake yellow as per the dye) but I KNOW I could&#x27;ve gone lighter, since I tested a segment for 1+ hr and got a nice shade of whitish blonde. I just didn&#x27;t feel like waiting the time for it since I was dying over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point there being; the dye is good and scrubs off your skin and furniture as long as you clean it ASAP. Just keep it on LONGER than suggested!</li>
    <li> Vivid lavender, lasts several weeks, goes in pretty quick and easy. Minimal bleeding when washed. Be sure to lighten dark hair before coloring. Be bold.</li>
    <li> I like this hair dye a lot!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as conditioning as Manic Panic is, but it stays on a lot nicer. I dyed my hair from blonde in the last week of January, and it&#x27;s still very very vibrant and nice - just a bit lighter.&lt;br /&gt;(Refer to the link with my picture)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first experience with Splat and I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;N.B. It bleeds A LOT. You need to watch out if your hair is damp or wet. I usually wear dark clothing after I take a shower. I&#x27;ve noticed some of the stains are removed easily with a good detergent in a long wash.&lt;br /&gt;The more you put on, the darker it gets, since it&#x27;s so concentrated (and hence the long-lasting effect, I believe). So try to put it on evenly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t squeeze it out the way the instructions tell you to. Squeeze it into your hand first at least, or put it on a bowl and apply with a brush. If you squeeze directly, the part the hair colour pours on goes darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, here&#x27;s a picture of me and how my hair&#x27;s been since I dyed it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only touched up the roots that faded faster because of me rubbing my scalp when shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I was extremely frustrated with this product!  I bleached the ends of my hair, as suggested, as I have dirty blonde hair with a bit of a red tint to it. I had to wash and dry my hair, bleach it, wash and dry, then dye, leave the dye, and then rinse. (Directly followed packaging) However, as soon I rinsed the &amp;#34;access dye&amp;#34; almost all of it rinsed away leaving me with NEON PINK hair. Not pleasing, as I was expecting purple. Not a fun look for a purple dress in a school picture, and three months. :|</li>
    <li> it was very messy but what do you expect when dealing with hair dye. the purple was nice some very very dark others a pink but that was probelly cause i didnt do the whole head just strips. i like it!</li>
    <li> I have bought this hair Dye Kit twice now. I love the Color it is easy to use. I work in a group home and My boss is super conservative but it ties in real will with my Black hair. the reason I gave this Product 4 out of 5 stars is simple. The Gloves they give you in this Kit could be way better quality I think. cause I have had the purple go through the Gloves and Stain my hands. so now I use latex Gloves that I can get from a drug store. the dye is very beautiful and rich in Color.</li>
    <li> Well I have used this product twice in the last 2 weeks. First I had to bleach my hair. My hair is thick and a little pass my shoulders and my hair was almost black. I had to buy two boxes and use both bleaches. So I let that sit for an hour. I am scared to leave it on longer than that. So I wash it out and the top is practically white but the bottom of my hair was a light brown. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the purple on my hair so I made my husband for buy me the Splatz bleach kit (2 boxes). So I tell him only do underneath the really light parts. Well I wait another hour me wash it out. It came out a lot lighter but not like I wanted it. I said what the heck I&#x27;m going to put the purple in. By the way my husband is the one who bleached my hair and put the purple in lol he would kill me if I told people that: anyhow I wash the purple out (2 bottles) and am a bit happy but also a tad upset because it wasn&#x27;t even. Yea of course it wouldn&#x27;t be even on the top and the bottom since it was two different shades of bleached hair but there was like bright purple, pinkish, and reddish colors. I wish it would have been more even. Anyhow i ended up ordering two more boxes for the purple and not even 2 weeks later I made my husband dye it again. This time it&#x27;s much better and much more even. I&#x27;m really happy about it but I can&#x27;t believe I went through that much trouble to get it right. I think next time my best bet would be to get it bleached professionaly and then go home and add the purple myself. Anyhow if you buy this item beware because it&#x27;s really hard to get off your skin. Of course all dye is. I even used Vaseline around hair line and ears and still had purple ears and a purple hair line lol. I decided to put some household bleach on a wash clothe and wiped the areas with purple. It really burned but for the most part the purple came off. Oh and the pictures are before I dyed my hair the second time. I didn&#x27;t take pics of the updated hair.</li>
    <li> Not even close to the color it says</li>
    <li> Cute color but bleeds like CRAZY when your hair is wet even after many many washes.</li>
    <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say a lot of the 1 star reviews on here are crap. They made me overly nervous to try this product, but thankfully I actually read a lot of the very helpful 5-star reviews before trying this out and I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for a good 10 years now and have tried a great many colors. (I&#x27;ve also tried both of Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s newer purple colors; both london lilac and velvet violet and both gave me a black-purple color that looked great, but darker than what I was looking for). I&#x27;ve been wanting a more vibrant purple since most I&#x27;ve tried ended up having a more red tint to it. I found the Splat Lusty Lavender at Target and decided to give it a try. I knew it was different than the other dyes I&#x27;ve tried so naturally I came to the internet for advice and I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot comment on the bleach because I did not bleach my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helpful tips from my experience(and ones I found helpful from other reviewers):&lt;br /&gt;-PETROLEUM JELLY IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. Use it all around your hairline to keep the dye off your skin. (Keep in mind the petroleum jelly will not wash out with just water if you get it in your hair, so if you&#x27;re worried about your hair looking greasy use a sulfate-free shampoo when you wash the dye out)&lt;br /&gt;-Leave the dye on as long as your patience will allow. I left it on for about 4 hours with a plastic bag tied on my head to keep it moist.&lt;br /&gt;-Try your best to not get the dye on your scalp as it very much does stain. I use a cheap toothbrush to get my roots but I didn&#x27;t heed this staining warning as much as others and have purple splotches all over my scalp. I dyed my hair 3 days prior to writing this and there are still bright splotches of purple, so be careful and be aware.&lt;br /&gt;-All dyes can stain towels, so be sure to use old ones you don&#x27;t care about turning colors.&lt;br /&gt;-Works on non-bleached hair(but probably not dark or black hair). My hair was a faded red color from when I last dyed it about amonth prior and my hair turned out a dark deep purple, nearly black.&lt;br /&gt;-The color will continue to run when you wash it, even a week later so remember to use an old towel to dry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-My hair is a little over shoulder length and I used almost all the dye. If you have long hair, I highly suggest you buy 2. Better safe than sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Great color, didn&#x27;t have to bleach&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Stains skin, color runs when damp, time consuming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to everyone that they read the 5 star reviews and take their tips into great consideration. Using a stain for the first time made me nervous, but the people who know what they&#x27;re doing gave GREAT advice. Many of the 1-star reviews didn&#x27;t heed allergy warnings, didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough or had problems with the seller itself. If you&#x27;re not going to take the time to learn how to use this product effectively then you shouldn&#x27;t waste your time using it at all.</li>
    <li> Once I finally got the color purple I wanted on my hair it was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short and WHITE blonde already. But I did use the bleach part of this kit to touch up my roots. It burned my scalp and any other part of my skin I may have gotten it on so bad, I had to jump in the shower and rinse it off within 5 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, because of not being able to leave it on as long, my roots came out orange. The first time I used the purple dye none of my hair took it at all except my front bangs, and it turned it pink instead of purple. So, I tried it again. The second time I could tell a HUGE difference and only left it on for 10 mins. It came out the perfect bright purple I was wanting. And even covered up my orange roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did drip. BAD. And it says if it gets on your skin, It will stain. And IT DID. I tried covering my head first with the cap they gave you, but it still dripped down my face, back, everywhere. So I finally just wrapped a whole towel around my head. The dye got all over everything. My tile floor and all. I even wiped it up immediately after it dripped and it still won&#x27;t come up in some places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest covering your floor and counters with old towels (or white towels you can bleach). Also, purchase a 2nd pair of gloves. They only give you one pair but since you are having to bleach your hair first then dye it the purple you really need 2 sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says to use a wet cloth if it gets on skin, and that did nothing. I have a 2 year old, so I grabbed his baby wipes and they worked better! Still had to scrub the skin, but it definitely came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up falling in LOVE with this color. But once I washed my hair about 3 days after, my hair turned a light pink. No more purple. So if you are looking for something that doesn&#x27;t last long this is for you! It says it last up to 6-8 washes but definitely not true. I was disappointed because I fell in love with the color so much, I was wanting it to last longer. But it is perfect if you are just wanting to use as a test to make sure you like the color on you. Now, that I know I love it, I will be getting a more permanent hair dye!</li>
    <li> So I bleached hair to the yellow stage everyone says to do. I disagree. I say bleach it to almost white. However everones hair is different. If you have black hair then get it yellow then proceed. I then put my choice of toner on whole head. After that I pulled out a bottle of splat purple! Oh by the way I did NOT use their bleach kit in the box! It wont even be enough unless your doing a few sreaks. I use the blue stuff I cant remember the name of. And a 30 developer. My hair is a dark to med brown with auburn highlites naturaly. I hate it. Been a blonde forever, Lady Gaga came out so I decided to get freaky with my hair. Anyway this stuff really works. I left it on for an hour. On bleached hair it came out the color on the box. The unbleached hair (due to me using a cap) was a differnt color which I loved. To bad they dont make the color I accidently made. I was not doing all over head just streaks. SO It worked great. WARNING:The dye will get on everything. use old towels. Wash cloths etc. Wont stain sink. Have comet on hand. I applied this to my hair with my hands. WHy? I have no clue! Dumb Blonde? NO dumb woman! So yes I had deep purple hands for 3 days!!!!! But it came off. Takes a while for water to turn clear. wash it out and dont shampoo for a few days. Yuck I know. Hide in your bedroom from your husband and tell him you have the flu. I have hidden in my room for years, months on end with the flu various headaches and other ailments just to avoid this man! If you are a hopless romantic and happen to adore and love your husband please allow him entrance to the room. So hair tip and a husband tip! Good luck! Oh ladies, my God watch youtube and get a good shampoo and conditioner and take vitamins and lots of water to keep it healthy. What we eat and drink will decide the health of hair! Research research!</li>
    <li> All dyes dye your skin but this stuff is instant. Unlike Ion and other dyes you have NO time (none, zero, zilch) to remove it. It got so stressful I only finished some of my head before saying &amp;#34;F this&amp;#34; and jumped in the shower. Another reviewer recommend Noxzema and that is the only reason I&#x27;ll be able to leave the house tomorrow. Vaseline does nothing for prevention.  If you think this is a good dye either; congratulations on being a hair dye wizard or  do yourself a favour and try Ion or another brand and see how much easier dying can be.  On the plus side it works great as a marriage test as my husband now has purple hands, legs, and a stomach. He was so great helping me and keeping my spirit up as he dyed my hair (yes I had help. I&#x27;ve never needed help with dying my hair before), scrubbed my neck, face, and ears, and ran to Sally&#x27;s to get me some Ion.  Update. Ok I was able to get some of the dye off my hands. But my scalp is a mess. Huge blots of purple wherever Splat touched it. THIS IS NOT NORMAL! If you think this is how dye needs to be please, please try another brand and see how much better it can be.  I got some Ion from Sally&#x27;s in purple to cover up what I could. It does not dye anything it touches instantly. It does not leave gross blotches on my scalp. When rinsing it out the water clears in less than 3 minutes. It&#x27;s thicker so it&#x27;s MUCH easier to get it to stay where you put it. It doesn&#x27;t have to be Ion but seriously do yourself a favour and try another brand.</li>
    <li> This is our second experience with SPLAT (Purchased from Walmart and Rite Aide not Amazon) The first time we purchased the Blue Envy  (walmart) to dye the UNDERSIDE of my daughter&#x27;s hair. It turned aqua/teal very uneven, very light....  I assumed it was because we did not use enough dye on her hair (it&#x27;s thick mid-back length) she has ash blonde hair but we bleached it to get optimal results.    This time we purchased the Lusty Lavender (rite aide) because last time the color was so light and uneven we purchased TWO kits. Again, bleached the UNDERSIDE of her hair dumped two full bottles of dye on that section of hair. This time, while the color is very even - it&#x27;s pink.    Here&#x27;s the kicker, when we did my daughters hair blue we also dyed my niece and nephews hair also using SPLAT We used luscious Raspberry on my niece - also uneven and well orange. Again we figured this was a \\&quot;not enough dye\\&quot; issue We put the Lusty Lavender on my nephew - that turned out a dark almost black-purple with one box.    Now this isn&#x27;t my first rodeo with hair dye I dye my hair every 4-6 weeks as I have since I was 12! This isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;newbie\\&quot; operator error, this is in my opinion, a consistency issue with the dye. I should not need to dump more than two bottles on a small portion of my child&#x27;s hair to get a result that even comes CLOSE to the color on the box.      ETA - spoke in depth with a SPLAT rep, they were very kind got a full history of her hair processing and had some suggestions for next time to get the desired color. They are replacing the products  so we can try their suggestions.  I have increased the # of stars from 2 to 4 because their rep was so kind and helpful.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. But fades too quickly.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re going to get this color and product PREPARE TO HAVE YOUR ENTIRE BODY COVERED IN HAIR DYE. Lust Lavender stains like the devil and will be stubborn when you try to take it off. Take my word for it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my hair plenty of times before and I&#x27;ve used a lot of different hair dyes, but so far, I think Splat is the best. About a month ago, I went to the salon to bleach and dye my hair purple. It faded out not even in two weeks, so I went to the store to get a refresher. I refreshed my hair with Lusty Lavender a few weeks ago. Considering my hair faded out to a very pale pastel purple/ashy blonde, this color worked pretty well. I left it in for a bout 30-50 minutes. My hair is just past shoulder length and I used the whole bottle. If you have longer hair, I suggest getting two bottles or more. Comb it through, and make sure you get the little hairs on your forehead and sides or else they will stay lighter and will fade quicker than the rest of your hair! Afterward, the color turned out a very, very, very bright and vibrant dark purple. I loved it! Right now, it&#x27;s a medium shade of lavenderish-dark fuchsia and I still love it. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the most it will fade out. Over all, this hair dye is the best and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> My daughter used Pink Splat over the summer.  She didnt use the bleach part, just the color, over her naturally blonde hair.  It was a bright magenta color for weeks.  It slowly faded to a nice pink.  Then by the time school started, it was still pink!  We tried to remove it faster with clarifying mask, clarifying shampoo, and Color OOPs dye remover.  Nothing even touched that color!!  Her hair is still pink and i guess it will take a few more months to fade out.</li>
    <li> The bleach that the kit comes with was amazing and didn&#x27;t go away. The hair dye stayed in for about one week then faded out</li>
    <li> It simply washed right out after one wash. Whats the use of that?! Waste of my money. GRRRRR not happy about that!!  There was no hint of color after I showered, none at all. Not even exagerating here.</li>
    <li> Looks pink in my hair, not purple and fades quickly.</li>
    <li> Good but product doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is just my hair or the product but within just a couple weeks my purple is very faded and I have to add more purple.  I tried adding it to the shampoo like it says in the directions to keep the color but that didn&#x27;t work either.  The first few days the color is awesome but after that it goes from being purple to being a very diluted red/purple.  I did bleach my hair before applying it too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different and or outrageous colors and styles for my hair. This kit also came with bleach so that the color would stand out on darker hair...or you could forego the bleach and just use the purple as highlights.</li>
    <li> The bleach in this package ruined my hair and the purple turned out to be a yellowish color and not the purple on the box, and it faded very very fast.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dyed my own hair many times and never had any problems. This product will not rinse out. My scalp is horribly stained and breaking out. It has been a week and my towels are still staining after a shower. My sweat is pink. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would rate the product highly or ever use it again. It should be pulled from the market.</li>
    <li> Just got this kit in the mail, it was well packed by amazon, but the box of hair dye was smashed before it was wrapped in bubble wrap. The peroxide bottle was half-empty when I opened it, and everything inside was soaked. The bleach packet is totally bloated and activated from the spill, the directions are a mess, and the gloves are full of peroxide as well. Awesome. Luckily, I wasn&#x27;t planning to bleach my hair, and the bottle of purple dye was intact and safe to handle after rinsing it off. I&#x27;ll update with more information about the actual color after I use the (ONLY usable item in the whole kit) bottle of dye.  (Fun fact: I ordered this off Amazon because all the Splat boxes at my local chain store were smashed. Maybe it&#x27;s just a special product feature?)  ***Edit/Update*** I changed my initial rage-rating from 1 star for the terrible condition it arrived in. As stated, I didn&#x27;t use the bleach, just the purple dye. I applied most of the bottle to collar-bone length auburn/brown hair. I covered it with a shower cap, and let it sit for two and a half hours, blow-drying the shower cap part way thru. The end result is incredibly purple, and it has a good depth of color. It looks dark and dramatic in low light, and almost ultra-violet purple in good sunlight. It bleeds everywhere when it&#x27;s wet, even  to the point of sweating at night leaving purple hair dye streaks on your cheek. After a wash or two some streaks of hair have lightened to a softer violet than the rest. I&#x27;ll probably have to do bi-weekly conditioner touch-ups wit the remaining bits in the bottle. Overall, it works, even on unbleached hair, but it bleeds, and isn&#x27;t the highest quality product. You get what you pay for, I suppose, but when you&#x27;re on a budget, it DOES do the job.</li>
    <li> To start I would tell you NEVER EVERA BUY THIS PRODUCT. Its a complete rip off the Color fades out of the hair within about a business week id rather recommend kool-aid packets in your hair they last longer. Lastly this crapy dye kills your hair so if you don&#x27;t like having a shaved head then should probably head this warning.</li>
    <li> Color was GORGEOUS but splotchy, ok, user error, no problem. Major staining of my ears, neck, forehead and scalp, ok, maybe I didn&#x27;t protect myself as we&#x27;ll as I should have. My biggest beef is that although I let it sit for half an hour and the initial color was gorgeous, two weeks later I am still not rinsing clear, I&#x27;m still flaking purple if I scratch my head and when I sweat I get pinkish purple sweat rivulets running down my face and neck. Working out and working at the barn is a colorful nightmare. Also in two weeks the color has faded from a rich purple to a bright fuchsia. Not impressed and won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I ordered Splat in Lusty Lavender because it seemed perfect. The picture on Amazon shows the exact color I&#x27;m going for, and it comes with a bleach kit! Awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except not so much. The bleach kit was no match for my hair. Naturally, my hair is a golden brown and full of red and blonde highlights. I&#x27;ve recently begun using Henna King Wine to dye it, so it&#x27;s currently bright red. Figured this would be no big deal because the box says it works with dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never bleached my hair before, so I decided to start with a dip dye. This way, if I ruined my hair, I could just go get the ends trimmed. Followed the bleaching instructions exactly, and my hair never got any lighter than strawberry blonde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Gave the purple a go, anyway, again following the instructions exactly, and it came out the same exact color as the rest of my hair. There&#x27;s not even a hint of blue pigmentation in the color. Really disappointing. Will be going with a different brand when I try again.</li>
    <li> i love splat colors. They&#x27;re really vibrant, plus they last really long (i&#x27;ve used pink fetish and crimson)&lt;br /&gt;BUT THE BLEACH. i have used it on my both my friend and i with horrible reactions. Within 10 minutes, raised white bumps and redness were really apparent and it itched/burned like CRAZY.&lt;br /&gt;It does lift pretty well but i recommend anything clairol or sally&#x27;s instead.</li>
    <li> I loved the red splat, because it was what is said red.....this lusty lavender has a pink base color &amp; fades to pink much to quickly.....** if u like pink go ahead&amp; buy this dye, but if u want purple: try SplatHairColor:purple desire or PRAVANA PURPLE, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do</li>
    <li> I love this color because of these aspects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is bright, and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff stays and fades nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap. Who doesn&#x27;t like that?&lt;br /&gt;You can get it at most drugstores!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its not true to the box. I kinda expect that though.&lt;br /&gt;It will stain you, your family, your dog, and everything else it touches.&lt;br /&gt;The lightener needs ventilation. You will inhale it ,and it will be unpleasant. I&#x27;ve had to do mine outside before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But overall, this is a great color. I know it gets a bad rap, because well...most of the time it&#x27;s not used correctly. If you have over lightened your hair and it is beyond damaged, no color will take very well. Your cuticle is almost gone, so not many color molecules will stay. At the same time, if you decide to put product in your hair prior to color/lightening, then expect mediocre results. If your cuticle is not clean and product free, how is anything going to get in there? It does stain a lot and bleed, I will not deny that. I can&#x27;t count how many times I&#x27;ve sat for two hours in the bathroom scrubbing because my mom had found stains in there. I also have a few pillow cases stained...because my wet hair decided to have its period after my shower. Mine faded really nicely; it went to a pale pastel color(also had blue tips that faded pretty as well). These are two separate times of the year that I&#x27;ve used the color, I&#x27;ve dyed it straight blue and black in between these times. The first one was right after a rinse in the summer. The second one was after it had faded for about a month in spring.</li>
    <li> This brand is AWESOME.  I am a girl and have very thin and short hair (pixie cut).  My hair was dark brown before, so I bleached it then put the Splat lavender color in.  I let it sit for a couple of hours, because the longer you leave the color in the more intense the result would be.  After I rinsed my hair out and dried it, the purple in my hair was very intense.  After a month or so, it faded to a nice light purple/pinkish color that I liked very much.  Another great thing about this brand is that it does not fade that fast at all.  I didn&#x27;t need to re-color my hair for about five months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few words of precaution, though; THIS COLOR WILL STAIN EVERYTHING IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH.  Your clothes, skin, furniture, towels, etc.  Make sure that you protect your skin with petroleum jelly and wear gloves while applying and rinsing or else you&#x27;re going to have some color stains for a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is also very runny.  it will run in the shower, while swimming, etc.  Make sure you use a towel that you don&#x27;t mind having bright stains all over.</li>
    <li> I read almost every review out there for this product and I was really thinking about not doing it. My hair was a dyed medium brown color and I wanted to just dye the underneath layer of my hair to the purple. So after lots of time thinking about it I just went for it. A lot of people were saying that the bleach is sucky. Really it wasnt. My hair turned to a strawberry blonde color after about 60 minutes. I left it on longer just because I really wanted to purple to stick. The bleach did not damage my hair at all. My hai felt the same way it did before. I then up the purple on and left it on for about another hour. After washing it out it was purple but not a deep purple that I wanted. I liked it still though. The next day I woke up and it was the purple color I wanted all along. This product is messy and does stain! Definitely get someone else to help you!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair with this at the same time as [[ASIN:B000WSF41A Punky Semi-Permanent Colour Cream Flamingo Pink 3.5 Oz.]] and [[ASIN:B0015R5WYG Punky Semi-Permanent Colour Cream Plum 3.5 Oz.]]. The Lusty Lavender has faded a lot faster. Granted, it faded to a light purple that doesn&#x27;t look that bad (very pastel), but because I colored it at the same time as the other two colors, it is quite noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the included bleach, it was also just ok. It did the job, but I had to leave it on quite a while and it still wasn&#x27;t as light as I would have preferred. I have used other bleaches before and they went a little quicker with less of a brassy tone. Since I have medium brown hair naturally and almost always have it colored, I also used [[ASIN:B002PMLGWW L&#x27;Oreal Paris Colorist Secrets Haircolor Remover Hair Treatment]] before the bleach which usually helps cut down the time needed with the bleach as well as the brassiness left by the color remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not bad for the price - but mediocre. I may still buy it in the future because it has a good price, it is readily available, and has a good variety of color, but I will take Punky Colour if given the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first week or two with this color is the best and the original color did turn out well, pretty close to the girl&#x27;s hair on the box for me. It did take about two and a half weeks (on bleached, thick, wavy hair washing every 2-3 days with dry shampoo in between) for the color to fade. I did not notice a lot of bleeding or staining with this either (unlike the Punky Colour which is still coming out on my towels three weeks later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be best if you don&#x27;t want the color for too long or aren&#x27;t sure how it will look/how long you want to keep it.</li>
    <li> This dye is ok. It&#x27;s got a nice color but fades pretty fast. It stains, of course, but a little baking soda and dish detergent cleans it off surfaces and skin really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bleach, however, is complete crap. The box says process twice for dark hair, but what it means is \\&quot;process until your hair falls out; if you&#x27;re lucky, it will be blonde by then.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to stick with professional bleaching. It&#x27;s more expensive but worth the price. Special Effects is still the best colored dye in my opinion.</li>
    <li> i have shoulder length hair and only dyed half of it purple and i used the entire kit because i saw reviews saying that the color looks pink if you dont use enough. This is my first time using colorful hair dye (i&#x27;m a frequent user of normal dye) and im disappointed. the color varies in different spots of my hair; the area near the roots is purple, but directly after rinsing the product out of my hair the color dripped off and the rest of my hair is a pinkish color. I do like it, but it isn&#x27;t what i expected. the color is also incredibly messy to apply, and you should cover your entire bathroom with newspaper or old towels before unless you want purple floors LOL. I didnt give it a higher rating because of the color varying from what is on the box and because it rinses out way too easily and after 2 brief washes the color has already noticeably faded. But on the plus side, the kit includes stuff for bleaching, and it is of a surprisingly good quality, given that it completely bleached my black hair. Also it&#x27;s at a good price, but just to let you know i bought mine at my local drugstore for 7 and change.</li>
    <li> I have been using splat since I was 16 and I&#x27;m 23 now. I love the red one the best. I&#x27;ve tried every color they have :) I&#x27;ve tried different brands for vibrant hair and thus is the only one I&#x27;m happy with.</li>
    <li> I used two boxes of this two months ago to dye my hair purple and it is still purple. It got better and more vibrant as the color washed out. I plan on redoing it soon with a third box I have though because it is now starting to get too light for my taste. Recommended!  EDIT: It is now three years later, and I have since used Luscious Raspberries, Neon Green, a blue and another purple shade. ALL HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL!!</li>
    <li> I dyed my hair green last night... I didn&#x27;t even stick a full day.  It already looks incredibly faded.  Don&#x27;t buy this.  It&#x27;s a waste of your time.</li>
    <li> For reference, I used Splat in Lusty Lavender.  I have long light brown hair that takes bleach fairly easily, but is also oily so I can&#x27;t really get away with not washing my hair every day.  I don&#x27;t have any hair salon type knowledge some people have written about with toners or mixing anything in... all I used was what was in the box, plus a bunch of dark towels to spread around the bathroom (this stuff stains, be careful), vaseline for my hairline, and a box of latex gloves - I went througIh a lot as the process went on, plastic wrap, and foil. (Not as complicated as it sounds, I promise.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the bleach it came with to do 4 streaks in my hair.  Directions were straight forward.  It does burn a little close to the scalp, so be forewarned if doing this at home.  (I did it once at home, and once taking the bottle to the hair salon and having them apply it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using No Bleach:  If you have lighter hair, this is a TINT so it definitely will &amp;#34;stain&amp;#34; hair, but with bleach yields brighter results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left the dye in for 4 hours.  I took each strand, covered it liberally, twisted it into a little bun, then wrapped it with a piece of plastic wrap as best as I could... and then tried to take off a glove so one hand was clean... and wrapped the plastic-covered-bun in a ball of foil.  I wanted to leave it in as long as I could (since it&#x27;s a tint/stain, not a dye, no ammonia smell).  I did this all 4 times and then took a plastic shopping bag, covered my head and tied the handles at my forehead like it was a bandana.  THIS WAS ENTIRELY NECESSARY - THIS STUFF STINKS.  I mean, really, its not so bad for maybe 5 minutes, but it&#x27;s this horrid jelly smell, just awful.  With the hair in plastic, foil, and under the bag, I could not even smell it.  I&#x27;d have never lasted 4 hours without that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RINSING:  It rinses the color of Barney the dinosaur in the shower.  A bright, reddish purple color, nothing like what&#x27;s on the box.  I&#x27;ve heard water runs clearer faster using cold water.  Regardless, it ran for the first week or so of washings.  Wet hair stains.  It stains towels, use dark or purple towels.  Cover your pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color:  !-2 Weeks:  Initially, it was close to the color on the box.  Very soon after, it began to lose some of the bluish tones and shifted to a more reddish purple.  If you are looking for that bluish purple on the box, it will not last very long at all.  I have considered using a solution of half Lusty Lavender and half the electric blue color they have in hopes that the blue tint will temper the red as it fades, but I have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: 2-8 weeks: For 2-3 months or more, my hair retained color... it faded to an AMAZING bright fuchsia pink, especially on the strands where I had used bleach.  No blue tones left at all.  If you were were hoping for a LASTING bright magenta tint?  This is it.  If you were hoping for bluish-purple (as I was)... then this is not the dye for you.  Again, I haven&#x27;t tried mixing it with the blue to see if you could make it a more blue purple, but as far as the color on the box, it does not stay like that for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stars: I would give it 2 stars for being the color advertised on the box - I tried it twice, once having a salon apply, once at home, and it just didn&#x27;t come out that color.  I would give it 5 stars if I&#x27;d wanted magenta, for having a super long lasting tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for bluish purple, Punky Colour makes a &amp;#34;Violet&amp;#34; color that starts out so deeply ultraviolet blue it&#x27;s amazing.  I don&#x27;t know how that one fades (yet) but I know it covered my bright clown magenta Splat hair and left me with the bluish purple I was going for, bluer than the color advertised on the Lusty Lavender box.  (It also rinsed clear my very first shower at home, only needed to be on for 30 minutes, and smells like grape gatorade - not perfect, but a good smell instead of Splat&#x27;s rotten jelly smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I was paying $60 to have my hair dyed purple at my cheap salon!  The dye wasn&#x27;t staying but a couple of weeks before being noticeably disappearing.  The third time I went they had to get new dye and it was a more expensive one so it stuck really well but my gray roots were showing before the purple wore off so my husband suggested I try &amp;#34;touching it up&amp;#34; by overdying with this dye.  Well, it worked far better than I expected from a cheap dye.  It worked much better than the usual my salon was using!  Six weeks out and I need to cover the roots again but the rest is still pretty vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only trouble I have with this is it does seem to rub off a lot especially at first, onto my towels, collars and so on so watch what you wear or the color of towel you use.  And yes, I did rinse plenty.  This kept happening even after several shampoos although it got less and less and it isn&#x27;t enough to make me say no to using it again.  In fact, I just reordered a set of two!</li>
    <li> Lasts for a long time! Has a very pleasant smell, and isn&#x27;t terrible for your hair. It does outlast any other hair dye, though. I dyed my hair with this nearly two years ago, and there are still purple streaks in my hair.</li>
    <li> stains hands and does not stay in hair</li>
    <li> the colour was awesome bright when i first had it in, then it faded really fast, but as long as you dont g swimming much or take good care of it then it should last really long!</li>
    <li> In order for this product to work, you must bleach your hair first. The product will only take on the bleach parts. So if you have blonde hair and want streaks, don&#x27;t worry only the bleached streaks will take the  color. Bleach your hair for about 10-30 minutes depending on your hair color. I have black hair so I bleached it down to a light brownish color (30 min). I recommend you bleach your hair and then shampoo and condition as normal, blow dry and then apply color to hair. Leave the color in for a few hours so that it 1. lasts longer and 2. the color penetrates deep into the hair. Of course the color does stick to hair after only 15 mins, of if you&#x27;re in a rush that&#x27;s fine. On my hair it&#x27;s a dark purple, and I get compliments all the time. I&#x27;ve had it in my hair for a month and it has faded but still remains vibrant.</li>
    <li> This purple washes out really quickly for me but while it&#x27;s in it is a beautiful color.</li>
    <li> Great, long lasting color!&lt;br /&gt;The gloves fell apart instantly though, so I recommend getting more heavy duty ones. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using dye on my hair for over 15 years, and this was one of the worst.&lt;br /&gt;I started off with medium blonde hair and was looking for a bit of a color wash. Wasn&#x27;t even hoping for a bright color, just a touch. I followed all of the instructions, but the dye itself didn&#x27;t take anywhere on my hair except the ends in splotches. And even then it was only faintly purple in those areas. I just was very unhappy with the color hold of this product, and would not purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;I had good luck with Raw, but the color only lasted for about 2 weeks. Same problem with MP.</li>
    <li> I only did strips in the front of my hair. Left the bleach on for an hour. It did not bleach all of my hair, but only the first two inches. Decided to try the color to see what it would cover. Hey progressive shades could be okay. Color was very runny, but looked really dark. Left if on over 30 minutes. It dyed my scalp (and I was really trying not to get it on my scalp) dark purple - darker than the color on the box. The rest was a pink/magenta color. After one wash I can see strips of white blonde peeking out, the pink is turning into a rust red color, and yet my scalp is still dyed dark purple. VERY disappointed. Already ordered Punky Plum to try cover this mess up.</li>
    <li> I used it for my hair and it didn&#x27;t really bleach well, the color also doesn&#x27;t stay in for long, but that&#x27;s cause i have dark hair. Other than that it is really good</li>
    <li> There warnings all over that it will stain everything it comes into contact with.  Yes, everything except YOUR HAIR!  I use color regularly, and left this on twice as long as they said to.  You could barely see any hint of color at all.  Certainly not the color represented on the box.  I will not buy or recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this, hoping to get purple hair. I hoped to get it.&lt;br /&gt;I have bleached my mom&#x27;s hair tons of times.&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the bleach not bleach my hair all the way, or bleach it to the right color, i ended up with purple, pink, orange, red, and yellow hair.  Over the next few weeks, the purple was washing out every time i washed my hair until i am now left with zero purple.  Very disatisfied with getting purple but my hair actually looks cool.</li>
    <li> Unlike a lot of the unusual palette hair colors, Splat lasts- I get a good month, at least, out of a bottle, and by a month I mean &amp;#34;still looks close to the color that started out on my head.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, and find that I don&#x27;t need to bother using more than half the bottle for thorough coverage- after three or four weeks, I actually use the leftover for a touchup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One immediate drawback: it does NOT look like the purple on the box. I&#x27;ve dyed about 5 times in a row now, and I&#x27;ve never gotten the shade pictured on the package, even when I&#x27;ve bleached first. It&#x27;s a great color, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it&#x27;s much closer to a red-purple (magenta) than a blue-purple (indigo) like the photographs suggest. As I let the initial bleaching grow out, my natural color (dark brown-black) causes the successive treatments to come out a dark, even-toned purple- yay! It fades to a nice pink- it doesn&#x27;t start looking &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; for close to two months at least. For the price of one application, it&#x27;s a very easy way to keep this color in continuously. I haven&#x27;t tried their other shades (blue etc.) but in my experience, the outcome will have a lot to do with how thoroughly (if at all) you&#x27;ve bleached your initial hair shade out. TIP: the directions for how long to leave in the color treatment are a little on the low end. I go for 45 minutes- 1 hour. It&#x27;s quite safe- I haven&#x27;t had any hair health problems since I started coloring. Good luck!</li>
    <li> super color but more pink than purple. good quallity for the price. i hope for permanent color and i&#x27;ll write in 4 weeks :))</li>
    <li> This box I bought from online, I found that the bleach mixture was more concentrated due to the fact that I definitely felt the burning/tingling sensation, I only lasted 30 mins on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the versions I bought in Duane Reade I can leave on easily for any hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I get a great bleach job with the online version in half the time. (30 mins with burning)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the in-store version, to get the same result with out the burning, takes about 1-2 hours.</li>
    <li> Red hair after trying this.</li>
    <li> when i got this i was happy and thought (because of how dark the dye was) that even if i bleached it it would end up being the purple on the box. it wasn&#x27;t. it turned out more of a pinkish purple and not the color i wanted AT ALL. then when i went to bleach it back to blonde 4 to 5 months later not all of it washed out so i had light pink patches. this dye does not work well for everyone, and sadly im one of them :/</li>
    <li> Do not use Splat hair dye! Just wrote this review on their Facebook wall...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy Splat hair color again! I usually color my hair a darker red but wanted to go a bit brighter so I bought the bright red box dye from Splat. I know how to dye my own hair; have been for years. Now my scalp, neck, and parts of my ears have splotches of bright red! Today I bought Color Oops to try and fix this mess and not even that could get all of this crap out! Everyone do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t buy Splat! Better yet, go to the salon! I&#x27;ve learned my lesson! Now I have to walk around at work and in public with this mess on my head. Thanks for nothing Splat!</li>
    <li> I am a huge splat fan, but this is my first time using lusty lavender. The purple is not the same shade of purple on the box, the actual color is more pink, close to magenta. Also, with every time I wash my hair, the dye is still staining my towels. By now it shouldn&#x27;t be (this usually doesn&#x27;t happen)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the red version of this dye and have been using it for quite some time. I must admit the first time i used this is was kind of a fushia reddish color, i was hoping for more a deep red. The second time i did it it came out perfect! I was very happy with the outcome. I wash and condition my hair as normal, and as it does bleed and fade it still looked really great. I went about 2 months before having to re do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the way i got the best results was when i left it in my hair for 1+ hours wrapped in aluminum foil. This&lt;br /&gt;is actually a stain and not a dye. The more time you leave it in the better the color will be. I then added heat every now and then. That allowed the dye to really soak in to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally blonde hair so i never use the bleach, i wish i could purchase just the color without bleach. I dye on top of color each time and never had any problems</li>
    <li> I recommend using Adore hair dyes. They are only $5.50 on Amazon, and are MUCH MUCH MUCH more effective. I recently switched to them, and it was a great decision. The only color they do not carry is green, but mixing colors of their brand is okay, so you can get the exact shade you want if you buy blue and yellow.&lt;br /&gt;I have years of experience, hear are some ways that Adore is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price difference, obvi. Adore does not come with gloves or bleach, though. Just the color.&lt;br /&gt;With Adore, I could wash my hair out with hot water the first time, with Splat, you must use cold.&lt;br /&gt;With Adore, there is a very large collection of colors that are all semi-perm, INCLUDING natural shades, so if you want to dye your hair a purplish-brown, you can mix some up and have it. You want bright hot pink hair? You can. Want just black without the forever commitment? You&#x27;re in luck. So many more choices.&lt;br /&gt;Adore hair color is much more pigmented, from my experience so far.&lt;br /&gt;Adores African Violet is a great purple with a blue base, meaning it is TRUE PURPLE. Unlike splat, that will fade to an orangey pink color after three weeks, it fades out to a light purple. Plus, African Violet is PERFECT for mixing up some toner.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B005TVSIY0 Adore Creative Image Hair Color #113 African Violet]]</li>
    <li> The product was way below my expectations. It was expired. I love this brand but the provider sucks. I dye my hair constantly with this brand, it is really reliable as a brand, it holds its color for Weeks and when it starts fading away it is beautiful. But the provider SUCKS. Side note, know this product dries your hair so use alot of moisturizing conditioners and leave on products. :)</li>
    <li> this is definitely the best semi-permanent dye I&#x27;ve used.  for eight bucks over the counter, it&#x27;s a great deal too.  don&#x27;t listen to the one star reviews---if you prepare yourself properly and follow certain guidelines, this color should produce very vibrant results.  here are some helpful tips:  1.  make sure your hair is just-washed clean, and un-conditioned, with no styling products in it.  the dye won&#x27;t stick as well if your hair is weighed down at all.  2.  make sure you use enough dye and saturate your hair with it, buy two or more kits if you have to.  the more you use, the better results.  3.  leave the dye on for awhile.  it will not harm your hair to leave the dye in for an hour or more---just not the bleach!  4.  rinse with cold water.  your hair will fade more each time you wash it---using cold water will make it last longer than if you rinse with warm/hot.  5.  wash your hair minimally to make the color last longer.  I recommend using dry shampoo if it gets greasy.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed by the color after I dyed it, but after maybe three days it started to really fade. I know all hair types are different but the box said for it to last 1 to 6 months leave it on for 30 minutes. My hair doesn&#x27;t hold color as well so I put it on for an hour. I have since re-dyed it once after 4 days and it still did not take like the first time. Now if your wondering if I pre lightened where I wanted the dye, I did. It was a darker blond but it still should have stayed. Over all its not bad for the price but plan on re-dyeing your hair often.</li>
    <li> This dye is vibrant and bright - better than what I was getting with Manic Panic.  Just so people know what they&#x27;re getting, when I first dyed my hair \\&quot;Lusty Lavender\\&quot;, it was a bright purple that looked kind of like the Ravens Football Team&#x27;s purple or the sort of artificial bright purple you&#x27;d expect to see on grape bubblegum.  But it took less than a week for that to look decidedly fuscia/magenta.  And now it&#x27;s really closer to very bright pink than purple.  I have very dark hair, and I bleached it a while first, so it&#x27;s possible that the purple would be less pinky if I had left the bleach on for less time.  I still prefer it to the Manic Panic Midnight Blue I was using.  I&#x27;d rather have my hair fade to a bright pink than a dull greenish yellow. :D  But it isn&#x27;t what I was expecting from the color pictured on the box (or from the name).</li>
    <li> Do not purchase this hair dye! I wanted my hair a dark purple, not a bright purple so I left out the bleach. Nonetheless, the color literally stained my scalp all over like the rest of the reviews say! I had to wear a beanie for two days to hide it. I let a friend convince me that it wasn&#x27;t that bad and the negative reviews are just &amp;#34;their&amp;#34; experience not mine. So despite the warnings, I bought it anyway. Big mistake! To make it worse, the color keeps coming out every time I take a shower. It&#x27;s unbelievable how much dye is still coming out and it&#x27;s been 3 days. Also, the top of my head is a lush dark purple and the bottom is a faded rustic purple. How did that happen!?!?! My hair looks horrible right now! Please, do NOT purchase this dye. You&#x27;ll be better off getting it professionally dyed.</li>
    <li> I used the purple desire and would NEVER use the brand again. EVER! In the house it was a very pretty purple but outside it was a horrible blue and pink. I followed the instructions to a tee, but it wasn&#x27;t what it said it would be. My scalp was a darker purple than my hair and hopelessly staind. This brand doesn&#x27;t just bleed, it washes out and stains everything even when your hair is dry. Clothes, bedding, fingers, everything. God forbid you have to scratch your head or start sweating. Yes even sweat will make the color start dripping down your forehead, and I don&#x27;t even sweat all that much. Another problem is the stains on your scalp last longer than the color in your hair. Five days in and my hair became this nasty reddish brownish pinky dingy purple. It looked horrible! If you care about your appearance in the slightest, THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT. You will not be happy in the end and once you put it in, good luck getting something else in to repair the color. I&#x27;ve been trying for 2 weeks with other products but it seems as though what&#x27;s left of the wretched color won&#x27;t allow anything else to take. This brand will end up costing you a lot more then it&#x27;s purchase price and it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in almost every color. I used the blue for a chunk of hair a few months ago and it faded to a really gross color within about a week. I then tried again with purple, pink, and red. It also runs every single time my hair gets wet and I can&#x27;t put on a shirt until it&#x27;s dry!!! My towels and pillow cases are ruined, even weeks after, it still runs. I haven&#x27;t been caught out in the rain yet, but if I do, whatever shirt I have on will be ruined. I am never buying this again and I am throwing away the other 4 boxes i bought. Also, the purple ended up looking really gross, nothing at all like the box.</li>
    <li> I started out bleaching my medium dark brown hair and although my hair is only to my shoulders, I didn&#x27;t have enough to really saturate my hair. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t turn out quite right but thought by the time I put in the color it wouldn&#x27;t matter that much....I was wrong. The color, which was to be left in for 30 min if I wanted it to last more than a month, didn&#x27;t really take. I left it in for a half hour and after I rinsed it out my hair looked slightly tinted pink.  As opposed to the purple it should have been.  Not happy with this product :(</li>
    <li> I love splat products as the colors are bright and long lasting. I have had this purple, the orange and the dark blue. I am a bit upset with the purple as it doesn&#x27;t fade to light purple (even though my hair is as white and possible) but instead goes pink. I fixed this by mixing it with some turquoise I had lying around to give it more of a blue base.</li>
    <li> This stuff is totally messy, not worth the money, and stains everything in sight. Once the stuff is mixed, it tends to clump really fast which will clog the tip of the applicator. My hair is dark brown. The bleach turned my hair blond. Once the dye was applied, it ruined hands, shirt, towel, everything. It was even rubbed in. Washed the bleach out thoroughly, applied the hair dye. Dye started to come out after several washes, even when it was dried. It got onto my pillow case when I slept and is still coming out after 24 hours. If you want to dye your hair, go to Sally&#x27;s and get the good stuff. I look like a my little pony character right now. My hair is purple, raspberry, blond, and brown. Not buying this again. Ever.</li>
    <li> Not very long lasting, it washes out very quickly. The &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; hair color ended up looking more like highlighter pink after rinsing the dye out, and even that faded completely out within two weeks.</li>
    <li> If you are not used to bleaching the product inside might be too much for you, I have always used japanese bleaching product and it&#x27;s more tender to you head skin, but this! i hurts so bad within 15 min. the color was ok it stayed for about 3 weeks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving my hair right now! :D First time ive put any type of color in it and people keep complimenting me left and right</li>
    <li> Works well on bleached hair. I did it on mine with out bleaching it, on black hair. It didnt show up so well but thats only because I didnt bleach it first. It still shows up in the light but not as well as it would on bleached hair.</li>
    <li> Dyed my hair purple for the first time, my hair was originally burgundy/dark red. The bleach is super strong, the smell was overwhelming and my eyes watered for a good 20 minutes, but it definitely did the job after about 20 minutes. Rinsed and dried my hair, it wasn&#x27;t too fried, which was a surprise, and put in the purple for an hour. It took okay, kind of made it a dull purple, so I decided to buy another box, forgo the bleach mixture, and just redye with the purple one more time for another 60 minutes. Great color, hair not too fried (although i am also using a leave in conditioner everyday) and doesn&#x27;t seem to be rinsing out too fast (i&#x27;ll update in a week or so) but I CAN&#x27;T GET IT OFF MY SCALP. Seriously, if you hit your ears or forehead, expect to have dark marks for a couple days, stains skin way more than any other dye I&#x27;ve every used, which I guess is a good sign for the hair? Decent product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 1 Week: Despite cold showers and only using shampoo twice, a lot of the purple has washed out. Although there&#x27;s definitely still hints of purple in my hair, especially near my roots, I can see it&#x27;s quickly changing to more of a burgundy color, which is still very pretty! Took about four days to get it off my scalp, there&#x27;s still purple on my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Photo is a little redder than actual color, hair is purple purple with hints of my burgundy popping through where I didn&#x27;t quite get the bleach.</li>
    <li> I put the hair color in after I had bleached my hair, then I let it sit for an hour. I rinsed my hair out and it all came out.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t by this dye. It is the worst. First of all when I bleached my hair it came out this weird mixture of yellow orange not blonde.  Also the smell will give you a migraine no matter how well the room is ventilated. I was on my back porch in the fresh air and it was still bad.&lt;br /&gt; As for the actual lavender color it gets over everything even after you have dyed your hair. The amount of color that comes out of your hair is crazy when it gets wet from anything including sweat. My pillows etc have stains on them and my hair was done a week ago. After the first shampoo in cold water my hair was purple on one side and a pink everywhere else. The dye doesn&#x27;t hold at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy.</li>
    <li> Let me just say, I added dye TWICE. This is the result of bleach + 2 coats of Lusty Lavender.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this color on my hair I had to bleach my hair first and it&#x27;s a really vibrant color. I was kind of disappointed when I washed my hair and the color started to fade really quickly. I am going on vacation soon and I&#x27;m nervous about it fading all out and getting all in the pools. It says to mix the dye with some shampoo and that helped a lot but I&#x27;m still trying to find out how to stop it from fading. Overall though its really a good product if you want a vibrant color.</li>
    <li> love the color but it went out so fast</li>
    <li> Definitely not the purple shown on the box, much more like an amethyst color (fuschia and purple-ish).  Also, it&#x27;s a bit thinner than their other colors so take extra precaution around your face &amp; neck to avoid staining.  Though it fades from it&#x27;s original color quickly, the much more faded color (which incidentally looks more like a pastel lavender) lasts quite some time.  Four stars because the color didn&#x27;t match the box but still a pretty color.</li>
    <li> I received this wrapped in plastic and completely soaked.</li>
    <li> This kit works amazing i actually used this to bleach my virgin indian hair.It works really well and it is not messy at all. My indian hair is actually 18in long so it was pretty easy to bleach. It took less than five mins for the hair to turn .for those of your girls that are looking to bleach virgin extensions this is the product</li>
    <li> It stays on for a long time, even as it fades, especially in my preschooler&#x27;s light hair... good thing its just a tiny portion of hair. I have dark hair that was stripped of color when I had professional color panels put in. It was a brand called previa or something like that.  When it came time for my 3rd touch up I switched to this kit to do at home and it was definitely more pink than the purple I originally had. It lasted about 4-5 weeks before I needed to touch it up again, just don&#x27;t shampoo every day to prolong it&#x27;s vibrance. It will stain your hands, but after a day or two it will fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the color and how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an old man (31 years old) with a lot of gray. I did not use the bleach in the kit, I just brushed the dye into my hair (with a hair dye brush I bought separately). This stuff is great. I&#x27;ve tried 2 other brands purple hair color, but they were junk (only stayed in for one wash, not super colorful). This is the best purple you&#x27;re ever going to get (I can&#x27;t judge the bleach that comes with the kit).</li>
    <li> I bought this from a local store &amp; it was a waste of 10 bucks. It&#x27;s like using one them hair color sprays you use at carnivals for kids. I thought it would look realistic, like in the picture on the box.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. It barely works. It didn&#x27;t even come out purple on my hair, it just ended up a deep pinkish burgundy. 4 washes later it&#x27;s gone and my hair is just a brassy red, which is simply the color undertone of my pre-lightened dark brown hair. I&#x27;ll try Manic Panic next time.</li>
    <li> Well first of all let me tell you that I absolutely love this brand. It&#x27;s vibrant, it doesn&#x27;t fade a lot, it&#x27;s long lasting, it&#x27;s basically perfect. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other hair dye brands (manic panic, Ion colour brilliance, adore, etc..) but if any of them fail I always count on this brand. I&#x27;ve used Luscious Raspberries, Crimson Obsession, Lusty Lavender, and Aqua Rush; all giving me beautiful results. But let me tell you, THIS STUFF MEANS BUSINESS. As fantastic as it is it will dye ANYTHING it touches. Your skin, the counter, the tub, the towel, your pillow. But I always find that if you use cleaning products with some sort of bleach in it right after you get out of the shower, it will get off the ring of colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the staining I highly recommend this product.</li>
