<li> this product was recommended in the hospital due to a old scar I used every day and help me to aliviate the dryness of it.</li>
<li> Everyone should have it to heal raw places as the result of too much moisture.</li>
<li> This product is not available locally.  </li>
<li> bottom was always rough</li>
<li> I still wipe/clean all areas, but if it is not easily removed it gets left.</li>
<li> needed skin protection on my rear end area due to surgery this product works</li>
<li> Also, I was advised by my son&#x27;s nurses that you should not necessarily attempt to remove all of the product when wiping as it will adhere to broken down tissue for extra protection.</li>
<li> Her rash was gone in less than a day</li>
<li> After the 2nd application of Sensi-care, the skin was no longer red, raw or even painful.</li>
<li> well no more rashes</li>
<li> We tried all sorts of products to counteract our baby&#x27;s horrible diaper rash and NOTHING worked better than Sensicare.</li>
<li> (For some reason I have a difficult time anticipating when to make my next order.)</li>
<li> I have a j-tube and the skin around it was red, raw and very painful.</li>

    <li> This was given to me in a hospital by a nurse the first time I used it. It is great for any type of skin problems. It helps with healing. I really love  it and have used it many years.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with the price for a product that works well for my husband who is in a wheelchair.</li>
    <li> needed skin protection on my rear end area due to surgery this product works realy well no more rashes the only thing is the shipping cost there is pricy</li>
    <li> When I get a rash or itchy skin this works so well. It is not greasy like most creams. It takes away pain too.</li>
    <li> My baby is almost always diaper rash free because of this products.  I learned this from the nurses at NICU/hospital.  Thanks a lot!!!</li>
    <li> We were introduced to this cream in the NICU, and it&#x27;s the longest lasting one we&#x27;ve come across.  A little goes a long way on any kind of a rash, and it beats Desitin hands down.  We mentioned that we got this cream to one of the nurses, and she&#x27;d never seen this brand used outside of a hospital setting.</li>
    <li> My daughter has been suffering from chronic diarrhea for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Her bottom was always rough but since I used this cream last year it has completely healed.&lt;br /&gt;So I can call this cream amazing bottom cream!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for adults as well as children!</li>
    <li> great product! works all the time and gets rid of all baby rash.  love this product. thank you to my doc for recommending</li>
    <li> this product was recommended in the hospital due to a old scar I used every day and help me to aliviate the dryness of it.</li>
    <li> This product was used in the hospital to help prevent diaper rash for my preemie. It worked so well that I continued to search for and order it, and it continues to work amazingly! It also helps to heal/soothe any rash that shows up if/when we happen to miss a spot when applying, or we run out! (For some reason I have a difficult time anticipating when to make my next order.) I have found that the product works best when applied thickly (you do not rub in.) Also, I was advised by my son&#x27;s nurses that you should not necessarily attempt to remove all of the product when wiping as it will adhere to broken down tissue for extra protection. I still wipe/clean all areas, but if it is not easily removed it gets left.</li>
    <li> Works well and stays put!  Not always easy to apply or to wipe off, but then that would not be as protective!</li>
    <li> everything perfect especially the packaging, which was especially good.</li>
    <li> It worked great for me</li>
    <li> Everyone should have it to heal raw places as the result of too much moisture.</li>

    <li> I have a j-tube and the skin around it was red, raw and very painful. After the 2nd application of Sensi-care, the skin was no longer red, raw or even painful. Cleans very easily. I am glad I can order this from Amazon.  I always receive my order very quickly without problems. Thank you!</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PROTECTIVE CREAM FOR sustaining healthy buttocks skin on disabled daughter.  Not only heals but keeps skin from any breakdown.  This is the ONLY product KAISER uses for precious people with incontinence to insure breakdown never present.</li>
    <li> We tried all sorts of products to counteract our baby&#x27;s horrible diaper rash and NOTHING worked better than Sensicare. Her rash was gone in less than a day and I truly swear by this now. I highly recommend giving it a try if you too are battling stubborn diaper rash.</li>
