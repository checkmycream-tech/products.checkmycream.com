      <li>, I don&#x27;t think they are worth it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend putting a coat of clear nail polish over them to prevent any possible chipping, but even without that they are great</li>
      <li>These nail decorations were fun and stayed on for weeks.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found that applying a clear coat over the applied strip helps, but they could still be better in terms of durability.</li>
      <li>Young ladies would love this</li>
      <li>I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Scratched and peeled off within a few hours, and I tried to repair with remaining extra stickers.  Then I could not get them off with nail polish remover.  Overall, frustrating.</li>
    <li> I had a slightly difficult time applying the nails, but I think it is because I hadn&#x27;t tried them out before. Once I got them on though I received a compliment at least once every public outing! Mine lasted looking great for about 5-6 days. Then they still looked fine, but I noticed the imperfections. Getting them off though is a pain, but that could be because I have cheap nail polish remover. You have to rub really hard and long to get them off with cheap nail polish remover. All in all though I prefer this over fake nails (because fake nails hurt if I bump them) and painting my nails (because painted nails chip within a day).</li>
    <li> Very happy with product, would buy from this seller again!</li>
    <li> I think these are so much fun and a nice change from just plain nail polish. I must admit though, the first few times I used them, they didn&#x27;t save time at all and in fact, took longer than if I&#x27;d just painted my nails so be aware of this and don&#x27;t try these when you&#x27;re pressed for time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions exactly and had only a slight problem with getting one of the strips to adhere to the tip of one of my nails. Once I used them a second time, I found that slightly stretching the part of the strip that is going to be on the tip of the nail does help them to adhere much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I used the strips, the better I got at it and now it takes just about the same amount of time to apply them as it would if I were just painting them but with the added benefit that there is no drying time so once you have them on, you can just go about your business. However, I recommend that you let them \\&quot;rest\\&quot; for a few hours on your nails before you go take a warm shower or immerse your hands in warm/hot water - even with gloves on - because they do seem to last longer if you take that little bit of extra care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought several boxes of different patterns and have used them 5-6 times now and I really like them. You&#x27;ll find that you&#x27;ll have pieces of strips left over or at least I did because my nails are only a medium length so I took some of the larger left over bits and cut them in a diamond shape and applied them to my already painted toenails and they worked just fine for that and especially when I put a clear top coat over them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that there are so many patterns to choose from and I got them for a great price too.</li>
    <li> These were so easy to use! They stayed on over a week. Very easy to take off with nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> Great price and they are SO super cute! I love this product and I love decorating my fingers and toes with these!</li>
    <li> I love this brand of strips they go on easy and last. They come in beautiful colors and patterns and come off easily.</li>
    <li> The designs are great, they are fairly easy to install as well. However, the design only lasts about 2-3 days on your fingernails.</li>
    <li> From the moment I saw these I wanted to try them. I have been plagued with nails that peel and could never do a decent manicure at home, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune at a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Love Letters and Girl Flower and they are FANTASTIC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the Salon Effects themselves almost act as a strengther/band-aid for weak nails. Then they are so easy to put on that you wish you had been doing this for YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer wrote that her polish started chipping after a few days...just put on a top coat and refresh it every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my Love Letters manicure and Girl Flower lasted for 2 weeks each. I had to finally take off the polish simply because they had grown too far from the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is that you will need to spend a lot more time removing the polish than with regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT IS WORTH IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps those of you who have been trying to decide about these!</li>
    <li> I use the Cut it Out design and get compliments constantly from friends, neighbors, family, total strangers. Mine don&#x27;t quite last 10 days but I work with dogs so my nails are getting nipped a lot. The key to application is stretching the strip over the top of the nail once it is adhered at the base of the nail. The first time I tried to put these on I didn&#x27;t do that and they didn&#x27;t last a day. Something about stretching them slightly makes them stick to the top part of the nail and will last longer. I tried to save the leftover strips to do a touch up on a few nails after about a week, but once the package is open the stickiness goes away. Still, a great look for the price and it&#x27;s easier to do every time you do it.</li>
    <li> Product is just as shown and at a much better price than in the stores.  These are great for quick manicure that lasts 7-10.. sometimes 14 days.  Very easy to apply.. Love them.</li>
    <li> I gave these 3 stars because they are kind of hard to put on by yourself, the larger one came nowhere close to fitting my thumb nail or even the next size down way to wide, the size after that would have been way to small so I tried to trim its which did not work out so well. Only put on the one so far it has been 3 days and it is still on mostly anyway. It has started to come off on the one side that I did not trim. I have now tried a top coat to see if this keeps it on better. now mind you I live in the mountains and use my hands a lot so with so much abuse to my nails I am surprised they are on at all. I am in my 50&#x27;s so I don&#x27;t think ill ever use them on all my nails for me it would be way to busy but to use them as an accent to the other solid nails it is cute. Young ladies would love this</li>
    <li> I L-O-V-E love these nail polish strips. I use them for my toes, and they last at least a month. I wore a set until the nail grew out far enough to look bad; still no chips. You do need to follow the directions closely &amp; prep the nails, or they won&#x27;t last near as long. I have wider big toe nail than the largest strip, so I just turn one sideways. They are a pain to get back off, but on the flipside, that&#x27;s what makes them last so long. I really like this combo pack &amp; it&#x27;s a steal compared to the prices at my local stores.</li>
    <li> These were very easy to apply and lasted almost two weeks. They went on smooth and look great. It&#x27;s a unique way to do something different with your nails. The stickers look and feel like real nail polish without the dry time. It&#x27;s a very good deal since you get two packs, much cheaper than the store. I will defiantly buy these again.</li>
    <li> The Sally Hansen polish strips are great. They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat and they last for two weeks. I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
    <li> I love this pack I did my nails and feet. I get many compliments and questions on how they can do it also. wish I could let y&#x27;all see a pic.</li>
    <li> I have ordered several sets of Sally Hansen Salon Effects and find that they are great buys. These packs are much more expensive in retail stores and the online price is far more acceptable. They come with instructions on how to apply them and I have had no difficulty in putting them on. They look cute and I have received many complements when I have them. They last me between 1-2 weeks (I do not do any difficult work with my hands though, but I do wash them extremely regularly because of my work). I find that the quick application time is great, as when I apply regular nail polish I often end up smudging it because I don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for it to dry completely. I do still put a top coat on top of these every time I apply a set. Additionally, most strips are long enough that you can use them for two nails if you cut them in half first (I do not grow my nails out too long, compare to your nail before you cut them so you don&#x27;t waste a strip). I find this way I get two sets of nails out of each set.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit difficult to remove and take a little more time to get off than regular nail polish, but considering the short application time I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> they arrived quicly. They work well. easy to apply. make sure to wear gloves when you wash dishes though. they come off easier the more they get wet</li>
    <li> like them. No dry time and they are easy to apply once you get the hang of it. I don&#x27;t wash dishes so they last about a week still looking fresh. After that the polish stays on, but forms lines or cracks.</li>
    <li> I really liked these. They look GREAT! The reason I gave 3 stars instead of 5 is because a couple of the strips were completely dry and would not stick on. Thankfully the ones that didn&#x27;t work weren&#x27;t my size anyways. It&#x27;s still a great product and it arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;They last very long. The nail polish strips started to chip a week after I applied them. Even after the week they only chipped a little bit. Now I&#x27;m on my third week and it&#x27;s chipped at the tip, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> I have used incoco nail strips before and this was my fist time using Sally hansen&#x27;s, I have to say that the Sally ones feel cheap (still cute) but cheap. I won&#x27;t be buying Sally Hansen nail polish strips anymore because even tough they are cheaper, I don&#x27;t think they are worth it.</li>
    <li> I love these nail trips because of how cute and easy to apply they are.  They look nicer than nail polish and are much simpler.  The only issue that I have with them is the fact that they chip easily and only last for 3-4 days.  I&#x27;ve found that applying a clear coat over the applied strip helps, but they could still be better in terms of durability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year.  Actually, I quite literally just finished doing my nails five minutes ago with Girl Flower.  This is why I love this product so much.  I can do my nails and IMMEDIATELY get on the computer to work.  No waiting.  No BS.  No chips for 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few fun tips I wanted to share for using these strips:&lt;br /&gt;- Use a top coat!  Must Must Must.  The manicure lasts SO much longer if it is coated in a high-quality polish.  My favorite clear top coat for these is Sephora by OPI.  It is heavy duty enough to protect the manicure, yet thin enough to go under any loose bits of nail decal.&lt;br /&gt;- The ones with a white backing (i.e. Girl Flower and Fly With Me) look awesome if you use a jelly polish as a top coat.  I applied OPI&#x27;s \\&quot;Last Friday Night\\&quot; (from the Katy Perry collection) to my present Girl Flower manicure.  It adds a bit of additional depth and sparkle to the finished product.&lt;br /&gt;- If you&#x27;re handy with manicure scissors, there is enough nail decal in one single package (1/2 the box of the regular Sally Hansen retail packaging, or 1/4 of the box advertised) to do sport-length nails and a complete pedicure.  There is one strip that is obviously for a big toe.  You can cut that in half to do that toe, and use the one or two nail strips that don&#x27;t fit your hands to do the remaining four toes.  It&#x27;s easier than it sounds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Amazon and good sales at the drug store, I&#x27;ve gotten this product inexpensively time and again.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone that doesn&#x27;t work in a corporate environment.  Even if you do work in a corporate environment, the strips are simply too fun not to play with.  If nothing else, do your toes!</li>
    <li> These are very easy to use, just make sure to follow the instructions that come inside the box along with the tools you need. It includes the file and that stick  (cuticle pusher) that professional manicurists use. The only additional thing you will need is the nail polish remover and cotton to make sure there are no oils left on your nails to ensure proper adhesion.&lt;br /&gt;I used these on both my fingernails and toe nails, and the ones on my toes lasted about 10 days with very minor chipping and the ones on my hands lasted about 6 days (with frequent handwashing). Removing them is trickier but not rocket science, you just need a good amount of nail polish remover on your cotton ball and a good deal of rubbing, it feels exactly like removing about 3 layers of nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;I am having so much fun with these! The designs are so cool, compliments abound when I use these!</li>
    <li> Love these and use regularly.  Bring out your inner little girl with beautiful artwork for your nails. Once you figure out application goes on quick and easy and last about as long as polish would. Price better than in stores if your considering trying.</li>
    <li> I had used the All-a-Flutter the first time, because it was pearlized the strip was a little thicker than these and easier to apply, but they were just a bit too light for me at least this time of year. (Winter) Still application was fairly easy, and I discovered with these that if I accidentally used a strip that was too narrow, I could use the other side of the strip or another strip if the other side gets messed up and just apply it flush with the side that needs covering. Buff with my finger and it was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the Girl Flower yet, but I find these do last as long as they say with a top coat (you may not need it, I just feel more comfortable with it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use my finger to buff, I only use the orangewood stick on my cuticles and the edges of the strips. It doesn&#x27;t give as clean an edge as I would like but only I notice it, no one else does. I&#x27;ve posted pics and because of the closeup you&#x27;ll see what I mean.</li>
    <li> I like these for my toes because they last a lot longer than on my fingernails... patterns are fun! I also like that you don&#x27;t have to wait for these to dry and it comes off surprisingly easy with nail polish remover</li>
    <li> I was sent a different flower design than what is pictured here. Other that that, the butterflies are still on after a week</li>
    <li> Way too much trouble to put on! Took a long time and the file included to file off the excess DID NOT work. I had to use scissors. I covered them with clear coat and they still came off after only 1-2 days. Not worth it in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend these nail polish strips. They work great and are easy to apply. Fun for ladies of all ages! For me depending on the design and how rough I am on my nails they last anywhere from 5 to 8 days. If you put a clear coat of polish over them once everyday they will last 10+ days, Just wait a few hours after applying the strips before applying the top coat of clear polish, if you apply it too early the edges have a tendency to peal. Have fun!</li>
    <li> FUN, FUN, FUN! I like Sally&#x27;s strips and these were just plain ol&#x27; FUN. Easy to work with, lasted two weeks and looked wonderful ~ I received may compliments on both the Girl Power (my favorite) and Fly With Me.</li>
    <li> I read lots of reviews before buying these and *thought* I understood how to follow the directions, but my first try at using Sally Hansen Salon Effects Real Nail Polish Strips did not go as well as I had hoped. I understood some of the complaints, actually. But as I watched the wear pattern (chipping and lifting) I realized that the reason I wasn&#x27;t having a good experience was probably because I hadn&#x27;t prepped properly. So, the second time I tried them I went very slowly and paid particular attention to roughing up the sides of my nails along the cuticle edge, as well as the tops. I was much more generous with the nail polish remover for the final pass. When applying, I was very careful to place them well inside my cuticles. I too only used half the strips, so one package definitely gives two manicures. They have good staying power and do not chip easily. I am really satisfied with them, and highly recommend them: especially for women who can&#x27;t apply bottle polish for any reason.</li>
    <li> They are best Purchases I&#x27;ve done! , easy to use and they arrive fast! I bought like 10 different  designs of the brand</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of these saloon effect strips since they were introduced in 2011 and I have used many of them. But this particular set, although very nice, was completely dried out. The strips did not separate from the protective slide at all and I had to peel them using tweezers. Then I applied the strips i managed to save on my nails using base and top coat to stick them on. The result looks nice, but I gave me a very hard time trying not to destroy the dried strips, canceling the easy application idea of this product.</li>
    <li> My natural nails grow amazing and these are great.  They last a long time and it doesn&#x27;t chip the way regular polish does.  Super easy way to get designs on my nails without the mess or expense of going to a nail salon.</li>
    <li> The best thing about them, is no drying time! The more you use them, the easier they are to put on and take off with just regular nail polish. I love them, hard to go back to old time drying nail polish!</li>
    <li> These are really cute. They work pretty well but didn&#x27;t last as long as the box says it will, even after I applied a top coat to protect it. I also don&#x27;t like that once you&#x27;ve opened a set, whatever ones you did not use in the set will not be good the next time you go to use them. I&#x27;m going to see if covering the package up will help prevent them from hardening and becoming useless. Hopefully it helps... Other than that, they are really cute and I&#x27;ve gotten quiet a few comments about how cute my nails are.</li>
    <li> The designs are just as they look in the picture preview. I like the fact that it&#x27;s no mess, and it sticks very easily to the nail. I definitely like this.</li>
    <li> These nail decorations were fun and stayed on for weeks.  I would use these again, although I&#x27;ve since used other Sally Hansen Salon Effects that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> The designs are cheesy but I chose them for the price. The flowers are particularly weird but I have not try them on yet. Maybe they will look OK.</li>
    <li> Awesome patterns. They go on very nicely, the nail strips are very stretchy and fit very well onto many nail shapes. They give you extras in case you mess up. Taking them off does require more effort than usual but it is totally worth it. They last for weeks and dont chip. I leave mine on for up to 2 weeks, until they grow out too much. I would recommend putting a coat of clear nail polish over them to prevent any possible chipping, but even without that they are great</li>
    <li> The strips came out good, but they did not really stretch like I thought so I ripped a couple of them and some of the tips chipped a little but that may be more to me not pressing the edges all the way down.</li>
    <li> These are super easy to use, last for weeks and much cheaper here than Walmart, and even cheaper than other brands or the salon.</li>
    <li> I tried the I love you stickers which were great. These were the worst. None of them fit my nails. They looked so cheap. I tried both with the same results. I was so mad. I just did a water marble instead.</li>
    <li> These nails are really the best. Once you put them on they stay forever. My best time: 9 whole weeks. not a chip.</li>
    <li> I love all sally hansen nail stickers.  I have been using them so long I can get them on in about 5 minutes flat and they stay on until I take them off with polish remover (every Sunday).  LOVE them!  I will not go back to polish as it chips.</li>
    <li> Used the butterfly appliques. Didn&#x27;t dry instantly. Smudged after they had set for hours. Chipped the second day. Don&#x27;t like</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t last very long when you work on a keyboard everyday but it is very easy to apply</li>
    <li> Did realize how much I really like these nail strips until I bought some and then I said I need more Amzon was running a deal and I said why not.....</li>
    <li> Nice design... Easy to do and it fits...</li>
    <li> This product has revolutionized my fingertips! I am terrible at polishing, but these look great every time. The butterflies got lots of good attention! :) Plus, they are a fraction of the price at drugstores or Walmart.</li>
    <li> These were priced so low how could you not buy them? I love these things! They go on so easy and you can do dishes right afterward. They last almost a full two weeks and I have noticed that if I put a coat of clear polish over them they can last a little longer even.</li>
    <li> I have a nine year old nail polish junkie and she&#x27;s been begging for these things for a long, long time but I refused to buy them because of the cost.  This price made it much easier to make the purchase. They lasted a long time when she put a top coat on.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It was very hard to apply to small nails and did not stick well at all. was a waste if time and money. I would not recommend.</li>
