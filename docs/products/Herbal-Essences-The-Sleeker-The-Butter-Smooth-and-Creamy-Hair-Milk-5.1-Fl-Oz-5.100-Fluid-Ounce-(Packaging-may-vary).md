      <li>Loved the product - smooth silkiness!</li>
      <li>works nicely too</li>
      <li>this will probably bug you a bit, but i liked it and it made my waves piecy.</li>
      <li>I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>
      <li>easy to put in hair and works fairly well.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very light, non-sticky, non-flaky cream.</li>
      <li>but I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the smell and</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I love love love this stuff..</li>
      <li>I love &amp;#34;The</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>loved this product, really helped!</li>
      <li>The very first time I used this, I was really satisfied with the results.</li>
      <li>It has a heady smell, like a sweet buttery coconut, and can be a bit overwhelming at first</li>
      <li>have long, color-treated, fine hair but a good amount of it.</li>
      <li>And very affordable :)</li>
      <li>In my personal opinion it smells really good.</li>
      <li>My hair used to be naturally straight, but it started becoming bushy, frizzy, and turning into wavy hair.</li>
      <li>really does make you hair smooth.</li>
      <li>My hair soaked it right up as I ran a brush through it</li>
      <li>I much rather use Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle hair mask - it really does smooth my hair and kept it shining for days.</li>
      <li>First, after washing my hair, I apply this to damp hair by taking the size of a quarter amount and placing it everywhere but the scalp.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>First of all shipment was great, it came a day earlier than the expected.</li>
      <li>so looks like people are scooping this up fast.</li>
      <li>not a game changer</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I primarily bought this because I wanted that extra shine after straigtening my hair.</li>
      <li>After washing my hair I added 2 pumps and it was nice and seemed silky then after my hair dried it was as crunchy and frizzy as I could get.</li>
      <li>My opinion is this product is fine to  use on dry hair, as well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also, not sure why some people are complaining about the scent, because it has a nice floral smell.</li>
      <li>It did not weigh my hair down and also imparted a bit of body----so important for the fine-stranded among us!</li>
      <li>I have blown dry my hair and used a straighten iron, my hair feels bouncy and light afterwards.  </li>
      <li>I have finally found a product that tames the crazy static hair and in general creates a nice, smooth look.  </li>
      <li>This product, however, masks that weird smell of the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not thick with a liquid consistency.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it really does anything to smooth my hair either.</li>
      <li>got the frizzies with natural curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I was able to tame it years later, but it would still be frizzy.</li>
      <li>I applied it thoroughly through my hair after I shower and wait a few hours, since my hair takes a while to dry, then come it out, and it turned out really smooth and straight, almost back to my naturally straight hair.</li>
      <li>and it really cut down on the frizz and made styling so much easier</li>
      <li>Overall I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love the way it makes my hair soft and not fly away.  </li>
      <li>The only con is the bottle size, but other than that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>Then I use a wide tooth comb and gently brush the ends of my hair to ensure all my locks get the same amount of product.</li>

<li> but this product does leave a little bit of a tacky feel to your hair, so if it is for a hairstyle you plan on running your hands through and the texture not be changed</li>
<li> I use this after I wash my hair everyday.</li>
<li> flat iron smells weird (Its a remington one, and i feel like all remington irons smell a bit funky).</li>
<li> I wish I could return this since I am not happy with the product.</li>
<li> I live in Florida, where the humidity is terrible.</li>

    <li> This product is amazing. I love the way it makes my hair soft and not fly away.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for am honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> This stuff smells and works amazing!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel great</li>
    <li> I love this product! I live in Florida, where the humidity is terrible. This works wonders for my hair. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is gross. Makes hair sticky.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It leaves my thick curly hair soft and curls maintained. Also, not sure why some people are complaining about the scent, because it has a nice floral smell. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> easy to put in hair and works fairly well.  not a game changer though</li>
    <li> I use this after I wash my hair everyday. To me it makes my hair softer.</li>
    <li> loved this product, really helped!</li>
    <li> First of all shipment was great, it came a day earlier than the expected. The product itself was also great. I have curly hair, for fellow naturals type 4a. This is both good for moisturizing hair and its great for anti-frizz. In my personal opinion it smells really good. It&#x27;s not thick with a liquid consistency. Overall I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great for taming flyaways!  In the Fall/Winter season, when the electric heat is turned on, I always begin my search for a smoothing product.  I love &amp;#34;The Sleeker The Butter&amp;#34; shampoo, so I thought I would give this a try.  I use it on my wet hair before blow drying, but also a small dab, rubbed between my hands and applied to my dry hair.  I have finally found a product that tames the crazy static hair and in general creates a nice, smooth look.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Smells great!!! works nicely too</li>
    <li> I love love love this stuff.. the smell is delicious and makes my hair feel amazing!!</li>
    <li> This product does not deliver on the sleekness it promises to deliver.Smells good though.</li>
    <li> I tried this but it actually left my hair really greasy and heavy after usage. I&#x27;m not sure it really does anything to smooth my hair either. I much rather use Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle hair mask - it really does smooth my hair and kept it shining for days.</li>
    <li> Smells great and does smooth but this product does leave a little bit of a tacky feel to your hair, so if it is for a hairstyle you plan on running your hands through and the texture not be changed this will probably bug you a bit, but i liked it and it made my waves piecy.</li>
    <li> got the frizzies with natural curly hair.  This works great.</li>
    <li> Love this product to sooth my frizzy hair!</li>
    <li> I just bought this today at Walmart. It was the last one on the shelf so looks like people are scooping this up fast. It has a heady smell, like a sweet buttery coconut, and can be a bit overwhelming at first but I still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dabbed it on my fingers and ran it down the lengths of my dry hair so I didnt have to wait until tomorrow morning after Ive had a shampoo to start using it. FYI It does say to use on wet hair. My hair soaked it right up as I ran a brush through it and oh dear Gawd! My hair is incredibly sleek! I curled my hair this morning and it didnt pull any of the curls out either. My opinion is this product is fine to  use on dry hair, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, color-treated, fine hair but a good amount of it. It did not weigh my hair down and also imparted a bit of body----so important for the fine-stranded among us! I will give an update after using it on wet hair and for a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Used it when hair was wet and styled as usual; it made my hair soft, fluffy, and shiny. Repeated use has increased the health of my hair. I wont go without it now.</li>
    <li> This stuff is heaven sent and I can&#x27;t wash my hair without it now! I&#x27;m 3b/4a hair texture and needed something to moisten my hair types while transitioning . This will moisturize your hair and then some. It&#x27;s a very light, non-sticky, non-flaky cream. I find it best to start at the tip of the hair moving upwards. I have blown dry my hair and used a straighten iron, my hair feels bouncy and light afterwards.  The only con is the bottle size, but other than that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Love the way this work (and smell!) But have to use 3-4 pumps on my not-thick should length hair. So a bottle doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> The very first time I used this, I was really satisfied with the results. My hair used to be naturally straight, but it started becoming bushy, frizzy, and turning into wavy hair. I was able to tame it years later, but it would still be frizzy. I applied it thoroughly through my hair after I shower and wait a few hours, since my hair takes a while to dry, then come it out, and it turned out really smooth and straight, almost back to my naturally straight hair. It&#x27;s amazing, and it&#x27;s my favorite hair product!</li>
    <li> Loved the product - smooth silkiness!</li>
    <li> really does make you hair smooth. love it</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how creamy it is. I bought a different item before this one and its like wax on my head I can not use it. I used this for the 1st time the other night and it came out creamy, I applied it before blow drying and it really cut down on the frizz and made styling so much easier, I definitely recommend this product for frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Love the smell. I primarily bought this because I wanted that extra shine after straigtening my hair. First, after washing my hair, I apply this to damp hair by taking the size of a quarter amount and placing it everywhere but the scalp. Then I use a wide tooth comb and gently brush the ends of my hair to ensure all my locks get the same amount of product. Then I blow dry my hair until its completely dry, then move onto straightening it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My flat iron smells weird (Its a remington one, and i feel like all remington irons smell a bit funky). This product, however, masks that weird smell of the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great! And very affordable :)</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and bought it after reading all the raves about it. I got this and did exactly what the instructions said and was sadly disappointed in the texture this product left my hair in. After washing my hair I added 2 pumps and it was nice and seemed silky then after my hair dried it was as crunchy and frizzy as I could get.
