<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am a professional barber with 3 pair of outliners/Detailers and these are by far the best..&amp;#34;One hitters OUT DA BOX&amp;#34; Par excellent....no need to adjust....the light weight small size is great for detailing and outlining the beard.  Now I need to replace my other outlines.</li>
    <li> When I opened the package, there were aunts and larvae in the box. It was absolutely disgusting! I&#x27;ve never had an issue before ordering from Amazon, and I hope my next experience is better.</li>
    <li> Real person/real review....perfect cut, close/sharp lines/corners, nice weight and general feel, quick shipping. I would recommend</li>
    <li> OK let me begin by saying this clipper is a fine piece of equipment for those looking to keep it clean.  For 10 years I have utilized the Andis T outliner which parallels this product in performance.  So without getting into the crazy debates over which one cuts better in my opinion this cuts better out of the box due to a closer setting than andis out the box.  So once you adjust the blades they perform equally.  Now the differences begin with the much better ergonomic feel of this clipper.  For a self hair cutter weight could be a difference in maneuverability which is of the utmost importance when edging, lining up, etc. this beats it but it takes some getting use to you just because of it&#x27;s very convenient but smaller size.  Another positive which probably will make it more of a favorite is the fact this clipper doesn&#x27;t get hot at all!!! For those of us that use the Andis know they can become the devil in your hand if you use them to long;) Again for the self barber speed is usually not what you want to do when cutting your own hair.  Now with that been said both clippers perform well.  Also VERY IMPORTANT if you are looking for the new improved T Wide Blade this model will not have this blade, but I find the smaller blade is not a problem at all but a positive because I do still use my andis which has a bigger blade.  So this provides me with yet another option for a cutting blade.  All in all love this little clipper and if anything changes will repost if need be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been compelled to write a review before, but find myself doing it now.  This is the best beard trimmer I have ever used. Also, I haven&#x27;t had any problems with nicks or cuts while edging without the guards.</li>
    <li> Love this trimmer - Had a Wahl Peanut for years until I blew it up in Italy a few months back. Needed a fast cut when I got back before going to work so my wife picked me up a Conair - What a piece of junk!! After basically tearing my hair out for a few weeks and getting no closer than 1/8&amp;#34;, I spent some time looking for a trimmer that would take my hair as close to my scalp as possible and settled on the 8290. The thing is fantastic. Never had a closer trim and if it lasts as long as the Peanut, will not need another trimmer for at least 10 years. Recommended STRONG BUY</li>
    <li> This a great trimmer i order from discount jungle but i received the 8081 Burgundy Detailer instead but im still satisfied to the fullest.</li>
    <li> nice item easy to use..not noisey..kinda light for detailers</li>
    <li> WARNING: reports of recieving used ones may be true. I ordered amazon direct, low and behold i recieved a box that was taped with dirty scotch tape. I was surprised as hell. So i inspected the trimmer and found only misc fibers or packaging debris that looked alarmingly similar to human hairs in certain lighting. So I disasembled the trimmer and found it oiled up profusely actually dripping. Maybe it was cleaned? I dont know honestly unless I got another unit to compare. But under a magnifying glass i found no  actual human hair inside the blade assembly at all, not even one. So i just kept it. I&#x27;d still advise to Inspect your package, more importantly the blade assembly after unscrewing everything to see if it actually collected inside where its hard to clean out. there&#x27;s hardly anyway to know if it&#x27;s been used without actual black or thick buildup of hair that&#x27;s very obvious. Least in my experience still A bit concerning the way it was taped up. So on to the review!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACTUAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;So far its near perfect. Its quiet, lightweight but not flimsy, blade cuts super close (when adjusted as per instructions) and best of all.... It mows threw my super duper thick coarse facial hair which in my opinion compared to most people I would consider a 9/10 for coarseness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why people are getting cut, they must be really pushing the blade into the skin, I have less cuts with this than my Wahl rechargble did and it was really weak and couldn&#x27;t trim without tugging hairs on my face or jamming. I always shave with skin pulled tightly and never push into the skin. So far its fairly cut proof in reality. Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can be a 5/5 if it lasts me a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;2/24/2016, is time of this writing. The on off switch broke internally. It stopped working mid use with half my beard shaved off. I had to fiddle with it for 10 mins just to clean up my face before it completely stopped turning on. Wow what a bummer it was great until then...close shave, powerful, never gets hot. And all because of a cheaply made switch it&#x27;s useless. I now need to decide whether to buy a new one, or go to a different product.Wow what a bummer it was great until then...close shave, powerful, never gets hot.

    <li> Was very happy to get this detailer with the blade adjustment tool because I went to my barber supply shop &amp; the ones they had did not hav that tool. Maybe you don&#x27;t need it if that&#x27;s the case but I am would like to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. The detailer itself is just great to me much thx</li>
    <li> Received ontime and as described happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Pretty good quality trimmer, has held up fairly well under simple grooming use</li>
    <li> Great for line work and edging around the ears. Not too loud and small and light.</li>
    <li> Lightweight and very compact design. I&#x27;m bias towards the andis t-outliners which I have been using for over a year now so those trimmers have set the bar in which other trimmers should be compared with. Out of the box, the 5 star detailer looked very sleek and i was surprised at how small it was. I will definitely make use for it when traveling, very portable. For some, these will probably be easier to use rather than the t-outliner because of the lightweight design. As for the edge-up itself, out of the box this detailer was superb ALMOST as good as my t-outliner with the PROMATE blade. I haven&#x27;t adjusted the blade on the 5 stars yet to get a better line but i have a feeling when i do this detailer is gonna be killin&#x27; it. Overall i would highly recommend this product to others. Being an amateur barber myself I think the Wahl 5-star detailer complements my t-outliners very well and i&#x27;ll be hard-pressed deciding which one to use whenever i do my line-up. Just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, for those negative one star reviews, potential buyers should completely disregard what those idiots say because like I said before, the 5 star detailer trims great out of the box but not to the point where it can irritate your skin unless of course you have adjusted them to cut closer.</li>
    <li> It is defect. It is not possible to become a replacement.</li>
    <li> These trimmers leave clean straight lines getting it close to the skin as possible. You do not need to add pressure on the skin as these trimmers are sharp already and will pinch if you add too much.</li>
    <li> Really good unit.  I&#x27;m not a professional......just use it on myself and my son.  Working great for us.</li>
    <li> Worth every cent, good quality</li>
    <li> Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer does a great job. Well made. Very accurate. Motor does not get too warm with continued use.</li>
    <li> This detailer works great! Sharp. Cuts a close cut once you adjust the blade. I love my detailer. Gives great shape ups and line ups.     This is my first detailer. I was looking into the Andis Superliner, but decided to go with this Wahl Detailer because it seemed to have a pretty solid rep from a lot of barbers. I wasn&#x27;t sure how long the detachable Andis blade would last.     Overall. Happy with this detailer.</li>
    <li> Wether you are a mountain man or a hipster this is a tool you need to keep your man hair in check. Quality build will last a lifetime and help you mans cape if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Great price for this tool.</li>
    <li> This clipper is professional barber sharp. It&#x27;s compact size allows you to take command of it and maneuver in a way that yields sharp lines.</li>
    <li> One Word all caps &amp;#34;PRECISE&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I got this detailer(8290)to shave my face, trim beard &amp; stache. I normally would just use my andis gtx (black outliner ii w/ t-blade). The detailer is alot lighter and smaller and i wanted a dedicated piece strictly for my face, I pushed the blade up, so it cuts really close like a razor. @ $45.xx shipped it&#x27;s a good deal i&#x27;d recommend it. It gets 4 stars</li>
    <li> The trimmers have been cutting the back of my neck bad, I called the customer service they said since the trimmers are defeated that I have to pay for the fixing the of trimmers. The shipping cost and the work that needed to be done. The person I spoke to was rude and didn&#x27;t help me out much. I tossed them in the trash, Wahl is a horrible company and I will never buy any of there products again. Ill rather go with Andis any day.</li>
    <li> Great piece to add to my line up thank you wahls.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is a barber and he mentioned that he wanted these clippers. I researched and decided to purchase from Amazon. Everything the description said was true! They are tiny and precise (after he adjusted them). The only thing that was not as described was the sound. It was supposed to be \\&quot;silent\\&quot; but there is a buzzing sound it makes. Other than that, the clippers are GREAT!</li>
    <li> lovely trimmer nice clean shaving good</li>
    <li> The clippers are nice, but almost too small compared to the gray Andis pair I have. I got used to the on and off switch, which I did not notice at first. What bothers me about the clippers is the bulky cord and the loudness. It is very loud compared to the Andis, which is quiet. Also, a smaller and lighter cord should have been used, like the one on my new larger Wahl clippers. Also, I do not need the long cords that they put on clippers, etc. I still wonder why they put those bricks, as they call them, on smaller items. They are ugly and tend to take up a lot of socket space. I keep telling myself that I will check on items to see if they have the smaller cords and regular plugs before I buy items, but then forget to do it.</li>
    <li> Zero gap it using a mirror and it is pure awesomeness</li>
    <li> Best trimmer ever. Ths thing has the power of a full size clipper. Will mow right through wet hair, curly, thick, dense, anything. Cut extremely close. Makes the sharpest perfect lines ever.&lt;br /&gt;Caution; not very kid friendly though. Sometimes its to sharp for thier soft skin. Have a backup of a different brand for the little guys just in case you see it leaving a red mark on them.</li>
    <li> I wanted to say that I was very impressed at how effective and it really does  what it suppose to,detail ,I&#x27;m thankful for that!</li>
    <li> Amazing! I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it! It gives a close and even trim, is very precise, and is comfortable to hold. I highly recommend this trimmer!!</li>
    <li> They suck! Not powerful at all! I love Wahls, they are all I use but I hate this clipper. I tried to use them but wasn&#x27;t getting the job done. Now they collecting dust under my station.</li>
    <li> Once you get over the weight difference between these and other clippers. ....they will become your go to favorites.</li>
    <li> Best trimmers I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> Did not get to use it being that mine arrived with hair in the blades</li>
    <li> I been using Andis T outliners for years but needed something less bulky for kids hair cuts. I came across the Wahl Detailers. Great product close cuts, sharp line ups. I gave the product 3 stars, I would have had no problem giving the product 5 stars but the Detailers were used which is still not a huge problem but the were used and full of hair. I recommend buying them new directly from the store or manufacture but if you dont mind used be prepared for other peoples hair to be still in the blade. Also remove the blade and get the hair out of the body of the Detailers. After that and i good cleanse and oil them up they will be good to go. Great product but seller could&#x27;ve made them more presentable.</li>
    <li> Cuts ok. Motor seems weak compared to my Andis.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I needed to help replace the other one. Yes, I will by another one when needed.</li>
    <li> other then my andis sylliner II this is the best clipper i have owned. it is great for all around shaping and plus i use it for making designs on the head</li>
    <li> finally after watching detailer in action on youtube i bought 2 ,counting days down till delivery .finally the man arrives with package right on time .he says you look like a kid who saw santa at xmas i reply you a bit late santa but the wahl detailer is worth waiting for.unpacking with excitement soon turns to disappointement when plug wont fit  our aussie system anyhow after buying power transeformer the wahl detailer is every barbers dream came true and much more ........so please wahl make detailer for australian market soon  ciao too all from joe the barber ..sydney australia</li>
    <li> Small, sleek, lightweight and handles well. I use it to design and line up my son&#x27;s hair. Although it is my first detailer, it cuts precisely and accurately. My husband uses it all the time to detail his beard and mustache. Thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> After seeing a couple of videos on youtube I noticed these to be in more barbers hands, and not in mine!!! So I decided Hey let me try these little things out, so far so good they produce some of the cleanest sharpest lines I&#x27;ve ever seen by an electric trimmer. The rotary motor is pretty strong which you can tell by the \\&quot;Humm\\&quot; as soon as you flick the switch.  Also, comes complete w/ a pro- set tool which definately comes in handy, haven&#x27;t used on any small children but I&#x27;m sure out the box it would be good for them. Only \\&quot;Semi-Complaint\\&quot; would be the size of the blade, it&#x27;s pretty small when compared to other trimmer blades, I know Wahl came out w/ a \\&quot;T-wide\\&quot; blade that is sposed to come w/ these but it didn&#x27;t come w/ my standard detailer... All in all a very solid product by Wahl, I think I might have to purchase all 3 versions... The \\&quot;Definition\\&quot; &amp; the \\&quot;Five Star\\&quot;!!!!</li>
    <li> Loved it . Very good clipper . Very precise and quiet. Wahl makes a great clipper for my barbering job</li>
    <li> These are light weight sharp clippers that you can take on The road or use in your barbershop. Give these a try you&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> Very light weight and durable. Blades are sharp but does require some breaking in. You can also &amp;#34;zero gap&amp;#34; them by adjusting the blades. In addition, you can also purchase the wahl  T- Blade which is a great blade once adjusted and broken into. I would also recommend if you do have sensitive skin, you might want to be careful when you are adjusting the blade. It can get pretty sharp and can leave marks on your skin or even cut you.  All in all, very good product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic tool for trimming Closer than my wahl all metal top of the line beard trimmer. I use this for trimming around the edges. It is plastic however looks great has a nice sound to it and runs like a top. High quality seems as though it should run forever.</li>
    <li> Great clippers highly recommended.  A must have in every barber shop.</li>
    <li> IF YOU SHAVE YOURSELF...This product in my opinion is by far the best trimmer/detailer to use.  I&#x27;ve been using the Andis Professional T-Outliner for the past 4 years now and it is a great product as well. However, there were a few reasons why I finally decided to go with the Wahl Detailer. First, the size plays a big part for anyone who does they own trimming. Andis T-Outliner is small but causes a lot of \\&quot;blind spots\\&quot; when you&#x27;re shaving in front of the mirror. To clarify, blind spots are where your wrist/hand is obstructing your view of your shaving path. The Wahl Detailer is slightly smaller, sleeker, and lighter which reduces these blind spots.  It&#x27;s so light you can use three fingers and still have a great vision of your shaving path. Secondly, the Wahl Detailer provides a more precise shave. With the Andis T-Outliner, no matter how clean or new the blade is, there are always some areas that I have to constantly go over again. The Wahl Detailer is so sharp that it almost feels like a straight edge. The closer the shave, the better the beard looks. Lastly, I love the fact the Wahl product comes with trimming guides for those that want to lower the length of their beards. I own a pair of Wahl clippers which I used in conjunction with my Andis T-Outliner. However, now I don&#x27;t need either anymore. I simply use my Wahl Detailer to lower the length of my beard using the attachments included in the box. Then it&#x27;s just a matter of doing the detailing of my beard. Another plus is that I have more space on my sink with one less shaving tool to use. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and at this point I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
    <li> The machine is the same color but it&#x27;s not the 8290 it&#x27;s the other one.The machine itself works good but does not come with the twide blade the way the newer machines are sold.you end spending the same amount of money you would have spent if you had bought the machine at sallys.</li>
    <li> This trimmer is great. It&#x27;s a quality tool made from metal, not plastic. It works great. A coiled cord would be nice, but I&#x27;m not complaining. I wouldn&#x27;t trade this trimmer for any other. I bought one for my son, too.</li>
    <li> Pros: For a clipper this small, it&#x27;s more powerful than you would think. It looks and feels a little cheap but it doesn&#x27;t cut like a cheap clipper.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t over heat like my Andis Outliners do... a huge plus since I cut my own hair. I&#x27;m very meticulous and it takes me a while to finish sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with guide attachments that I&#x27;ve used to trim my beard down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: While it&#x27;s powerful for a small trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t give as crisp a line as say a Styliner in my opinion. The blades appear to be zero gapped already do I&#x27;, not exactly sure if there&#x27;s a way to make it any sharper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the little hairs out of the blades is a little harder than Andis clippers for some reason. They get stuck and I really had to work back and forth with a toothbrush to dislodge some of them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All In all, I like it enough to where I won&#x27;t return it and will continue to use it. That being said, I think I will be buying a Styliner as my go to line up trimmer and using this for travel or quick touch ups.</li>
    <li> Not quite down to the skin, but close. The machine is a little on the small side but that can be a good thing.</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to get this trimmer as my barber always uses it on me and does a good job! I was in the US late last year and wanted to get it, I didnt because I stay in Africa and the voltage is 220V unlike the US which is 120V. I couldn&#x27;t just stand not having my trimmer and decided I would get it and purchase a step-down transformer with it.&lt;br /&gt;Well my Trimmer got to me quickly (thanks to Amazon Prime), I am happy with the product and I am VERY sure my friends back home would want theirs also.... and YES! the packaging was good.</li>
    <li> They are ok, not powerful enough for me... I&#x27;m going to stay using my andis t-outliners...</li>
    <li> Great liners to have but the standard blade that comes with these aren&#x27;t the best so I would upgrade the blade ASAP!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow IG: Moblie_cutz</li>
    <li> These trimmers are by far one of the best, in my opinion they are better or at least on par with the T-liners. However these clippers are sharp enough I wouldn&#x27;t recommend zero gapping these because it may not cut everyone but believe me it will attack those clients with Sensitive skin! I&#x27;d recommend getting the T wide blade for these!</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmers! They cut really well and they look great. I&#x27;ve been enjoying these timmers since I bought them. Loving these trimmers!</li>
    <li> Save your time and get a good old t-outliner. upgrade the t-blade with a pro-mate gold blade (sold separately) and you will get razor sharp shape ups right out of the box.  No 0-gapping needed.</li>
    <li> I bought these to chop my beard to down stubble as I&#x27;m quite tired of using the small and ineffective ones built into the back of my electric razor.  This trimmer cuts through thick facial hair without flinching and typically in only a single pass.  The T-blade is perfect for getting into awkward corners around mouth and nose.</li>
    <li> Works like a dream ,easy to 0 gap ,for razor sharp edging! Stays cool, really light ,great when using on kids also!</li>
    <li> I love it, n such a GREAT buy!!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;m so happy because it came on time, and everything was right.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Amazon for quite a while now and have never written a negative review.  I cannot make a statement on how good this product is.  I would love to give it a 5 star review as others have.  Unfortunately the seller Maitri Mega Mall sold me a used item.  There were hair clippings all over the package and the trimmer itself.  I&#x27;m returning it today and looking to purchase the same product new from another seller.</li>
    <li> Ordered thses to shave with. I was need of a pair trimmers i could use on my face and get a nice close shave with. These trimmers work just fine. I can shave and not worry about cutting myself. They are small enough to be held in one hand. I would recommed to anyone wanting to buy.</li>
    <li> For years I had a rechargable beard trimmer, which I hated. I decided to splurge and get a new one, and I decided that there was really no benefit to rechargable, so I went for this set, and I am really happy that I did.&lt;br /&gt;The design is great. It is small, but feels good in your hand. It&#x27;s all metal, so it has a very quality feel too it. It has a little hook on the bottom that you conld concievably use to hang on something. I just toss it in a bag under. When I ordered, I bought a bottle of mineral oil. I probably should have waited, because the little container that came with it will probably last a long time. My favorite thing about these trimmers is how powerful they are. My old rechareable ones used to get caught up in my beard, and tug away. I have not had that problem at all with these. In fact, I needed to do some emergency hair trimming on my dog, who has a thick, thick coat, and these trimmers had no problem whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to me for the unit is that it didn&#x27;t come with enough lengths. I wish it had a few more. I can order more off Amazon, so I will do that one day.</li>
    <li> Wigady Wack, not a good cut.</li>
    <li> Do not waste money on this. It&#x27;s small,noisy and blades are not sharp.</li>
    <li> Worked great but got some customer complaints that the trimmers hurt them. The blades were very sharp and pinched your skin. Maybe I just got a lemon!</li>
    <li> Great trimmers light weight only complaint would be they sometimes nip my clients</li>
    <li> I have been using this trimmer for the past week and the results are just outstanding. Achieving the perfect fade and precise edges is just a piece of cake. Also this trimmer is set to cut a true &amp;#34;zero&amp;#34;, so avoid to much pressure or use the zero guard that come with it. The latter is for all the amateurs that cut their guests... Duh!</li>
    <li> For some reason, I cant ever find the perfect trimmer for my clean powerful edge cuts. This is powerful but very prickly that it leaves cut marks and irritations. I like the power but not the performance.</li>
    <li> I just opened the box and I was surprised to see that the clippers were used.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure who returned this item.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t rate the clippers to see how they cut.</li>
    <li> This is the detailer/trimmer I&#x27;ve been looking for all these years and I got it at a reasonable price. Does all the small jobs I&#x27;ve had problems doing before with other trimmers. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I open the package I was surprise because it was so small. Actually it was smaller than the length of my hand. But its true good things come in small packages. This thing works! I am not a barber and I use it to cut my hair bald and trim my face. It has exceeded my expectations in both areas. This is the 1st trimer I can cut my hair with the grain and get as close as I could with a typical adjustable trimmer. So I was amazed by the job it did when I went against the grain. When I trimmed my facial hair it looked like I just came out of a barber shop. This little trimmer gets the job done! Highly recommended for anyone who likes to save money and do their own haircuts.</li>
    <li> Works great thank you</li>
    <li> Above average power for size. Good choice for finishing work, not shaving an entire head. For the competitive price, hard to talk oneself out of purchase.</li>
    <li> these edgers do an outstanding job when it comes to shape ups, line ups, edges!! I&#x27;v been using the andis T outliners for a while now and I also love them as well. but the andis are a bit big for me at times. I have small hands so naturally these wahl detailers fit great in the palm of my hand and they&#x27;re also light weight witch is pretty nice when doing shape ups. Right now if I had to choose between the wahls or andis I would choose WAHL. The only thing that I have found wrong with ordering these trimmers from this particular company is that the black part on the bottom piece of the trimmers had a few scratch&#x27;s right out of the box. the chrome finish was fine and they work great, so im thinking it may have been someone just throwing the box around during shipping or something. For me this is okay I don&#x27;t mind the couple of scratch&#x27;s. i just wanted to put this out there so that if someone does care about it they will know. All in all im very happy with the product and the shipping time too it only took 3 days to get here. so that was nice. i also ordered the T wide blade with these and i cant wait to install it and try them out!! hope this review helps ya out.&lt;br /&gt;  god bless,</li>
    <li> Good machine only thing. not that good on the beard and edge ups I would go with the Outliner II from andis for that but this is a good one to have.</li>
    <li> si compro 6 unidades me las pueden enviar todas juntas ósea en el mismo envió a Venezuela</li>
    <li> Received and open restock package and a beat up box with no attachments and carrying bag as the amazon described in their web page and wrong model number when I look on the back of trimmer that model number was 8081 not 8290 totally different from model number I order and what the box says, if you buy one of these trimmers pay close attention to that small detail ...I guess it wasn&#x27;t my lucky day I packed the item right away and send it back to amazon for a full refund.</li>
    <li> I like the blade better on the these detailer then the burgundy detailers</li>
    <li> Good trimmer at a great price . I cut all day at the barbershop and this trimmer does a good job.</li>
    <li> Razor sharp lines, easily adjusted to zero overlap, quiet and cool running. Much better than my old Outliner II.</li>
    <li> I got these instead of the 5 star detailer because I wanted a machine that could do all tasks associated with trimming .  I found the T-wide on the 5 star just a bit too wide and found them bumping into parts of the trim they shouldn&#x27;t and I had to constantly watch the opposite end when doing a line up . The black detailer is perfect. A bit narrower blade and was perfect for designer chinstraps and things I fount the T wide just to wide to do comfortably .  Don&#x27;t get me wrong . The 5 star is great but I just found it to be better suited for a more limited set of tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional barber . I just enjoy cutting my own and friends hair so I dont need 5 different machines. I found the wahl 5 star seniors and the black detailer to do everything I need done in 2 machines. I haven&#x27;t zero gaped either yet and find them both very tight . I may at a later date when I&#x27;ve gotten to know them better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These trimmers are loud if you will be cutting kids hair though . Little kids might get scared when they here the 2 stroke sounding motor near their ears . They are also smaller than they looked in the stock photo which I liked , average on weight . I am very happy with the purchase and would recommend these to a friend .</li>
    <li> I purchased these clipper for my mustache and all they did was frustrate me. I used them for about 45 seconds and put them in the box and returned them.</li>
    <li> EDIT: Its been 9 months and I STILL LOVE this trimmer. I see soo many reviews about people saying the blade wasnt sharp this and the adjustment tool didnt work that. I&#x27;m just going to say that they must not have followed the directions or knew what they were doing.  With the adjuster it allows you to Zero gap the blade so that it is so sharp you cant press it against your skin or drag it without it cutting you. I have NO idea what they were doing lol. I&#x27;m still VERY happy with mine. Very little maint. if any has been required to keep these going well. Buy these trimmer, take care of them, and you&#x27;ll never need another pair. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I already had a pair of andis T-edgers, but in a strange series of events I left those at the in laws in Kentucky. After realizing I&#x27;d left them, I decided to make a move and grab another pair, but after some reading I came across these trimmers, and decided to give them a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;The trimmers themselves came in a nice box packaged with instructions, a trimmer adjustment tool, 3 guards ( 1.5, 1, 1/2 ), trimmer oil, and a blade guard. The package was more than adequate and was just as you&#x27;d expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;-------------&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a nice black, grey, and kind of shiny chrome look. Its very interesting looking, and fits nicely into your hand. It is a bit smaller than my Andis, and I heard online a few places that it feels like a toy. After holding it I can promise you its very sturdy, and has some weight as to let you know this is NOT a toy or a walmart trimmer. The on off switch resides along the bottom of the unit, as does a hook to hang the trimmers and the power cord. It is smaller than my andis but as a large man, I can assure you its easy to hold and still feels ergonomic in my hands. I&#x27;d like to note these do not get hot EVER! I lined up myself and my roomates with this and it doesn&#x27;t get nearly as warm as my t edgers did. The RED ones are the newer ones, and initially I was just going to return these for fear they wouldn&#x27;t be as good, but after using them there is NO way I&#x27;d return these. They are EXCELLENT !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blades&lt;br /&gt;------------&lt;br /&gt;I was upset at first that the RED detailer is the newer one with a slightly larger blade, but remember that LARGER doesnt mean better ! Out the box this comes with a fairly sharp T-blade, that cuts ok. After pulling out the instructions and using the trimmer blade adjustment tool that came in the package I EASILY was able to adjust these as sharp as I wanted. WHEN I TELL YOU this is the SHARPEST blade I&#x27;ve ever had, trust me. Once you adjust this you have to be careful !!! There will be no need to go over lines more than once or twice MAX. it left a SUPER sharp line that almost didnt look real! I actually went and adjusted them again after the first few shaves to make them a little less sharp. You won&#x27;t have to press or anything. A simple light hand will do just fine !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even worried about other trimmers. This will get as sharp as you want them too ! YOU&#x27;VE BEEN WARNED !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall value&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;I didnt understand why there was such a big split between these and the t-edgers from Andis. I do now. They both have their differences, and honestly both can get the job done. I prefer the slightly smaller size of the wahl detailer, and I also prefer the fact that this wahl doesn&#x27;t get hot ! It took a half second or so to get used to the size, but after that it wasnt an issue even in the least. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend these to anyone !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL I did my best to give you a SOLID review on these trimmers, as I know sometimes you need a good firsthand review to make a decision. I have owned BOTH the andis T-Edgers and these. I prefer these for a few reasons but know they can both get the job done. I&#x27;m confident that if you order these you&#x27;ll be MORE than happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. I&#x27;m not a worker of Wahl or Amazon, but I feel when I come across a good product I want you all to know ! Happy trimming !</li>
    <li> I have been shopping on Amazon for about three years now, And never had a problem with any of their products. But I was very unhappy with the way this trimmer had arrived. When I open up the box I notice that the storage case that comes with the trimmer had been cracked. I think is happend because the shipment box it came in had the air bubble pastic only on one side of the box. The trimmer had a huge scratch in it to add to my already unhappy order, also I think this is one of the older models because the newer trimmers come with the T-WIDE blade that is 1/4\\&quot; wider. However The trimmer does work and does have a fancy look to it, but the motor in it sounds and feels kind of cheap, unlike the andis t-outliners. I get the feeling that within a year the motor in this trimmer will burn-out, next time I will think twice before ordering anything like this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great with the t wide blade! Good edger to use for any barber . I love these liners !</li>
    <li> This trimmer is a very good trimmer.  The power, the accuracy with the 1/2&amp;#34; snap on adjustments, and the length of the cord are all amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the blade rusted after a weeks use.  I did use the oil that comes with it too.  I still use it and it trims well, just have to be careful with it until my replacement blade comes.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a christmas gift and he loves it. Good price and it arrived earlier than expected. Very easy buy</li>
    <li> Work great, and it they go out I will buy another pair detail good, good on kids old people fit in tight spots like over the ear excellent.</li>
    <li> One of the best Wahl products for Professionals Haircuts !!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is very strong powerfull and super nice looking for my shop</li>
    <li> I think i love this trimmer lol. I&#x27;ve had it for about 18 months now. I&#x27;ve dropped it multiple times, rarely ever oil the blades and it still works like it did when i bought it. Being a African American, a nice line is important. I use then at least twice a week so they get a decent amount of use and  I&#x27;m not one for spending $20+ a week at the barber, so i use these on myself. They are easy to handle and the cut is close. Good on the neck and mustache. If i was to take better care if them i think they would last for a couple more years without having to change the blades.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  I was trying to duplicate the trimmer that my local barbershop uses for trimming my ears, neck, etc.  I have bought several kinds but still can&#x27;t find the precision yet, but this is the best I have seen so far.</li>
    <li> Heavy duty and well made with a commercial cord. Works very well and the wider blade is very handy, however,it is quite noisy.</li>
    <li> i use these these with the wahl T wide blade and it works well for those crispy lines</li>
    <li> I bought a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Detailer. When I opened the box, it was obvious that it had been previously used. There was someone&#x27;s hair under the blade. The blade itself had some sort of black plastic residue on it, almost like it had been used to cut plastic. There was also a long scratch on the chrome body and two dents as if it were dropped.  I returned it. Hopefully they don&#x27;t resell it to someone else unless they sell it as a used product at a discounted price.</li>
    <li> My wife is a Cosmotologist and I purchased this for her since her last set of clippers final gave out. I saw these online and decided to give it a shot. They are decent clippers for someone that just would like a decent set but I have to warn you, they do cut the skin. My wife has never had a set that has cut the skin like that before. They are nicks but it still cuts. Not good for young children. The blades seem to be slightly dull as well.</li>
    <li> Trimmer looked used and blade was rusted</li>
    <li> The barber in my family, love how their easy to handle.</li>
    <li> These are amazing and there part of my arsenal for barbering. Wahl&#x27;s are my best clippers.</li>
    <li> Trimmer is great but this one arrived used (with hairs in it) and with parts missing!  Not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> These are the best liners I have ever used hands down out the box ready to go! Light weight, fits nice in the hand, and just an all around good pair of liners!</li>
    <li> Excellent trimmer. It cuts close right out the box and has a medium to high learning curve for self adjusting. I&#x27;m not sure what the difference is between the black and the red versions. I own the red. The only problem with this trimmer is (and check with your local barbers to verify this fact) is that theses particular 5-star versions DO NOT LAST LONG. I have had other Wahl trimmers and andis clippers for 5 to 7 years now. These first broke on me within the first 6mos of ownership. I touch base with one of the regular barbers I go to when I&#x27;m feeling lazy and want to spend $20+ on a fade to inquire about his experience, based on my occurrence. A couple of the guys confirmed that the Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer are great for beginners to pros (I&#x27;m in the middle) but, expect to buy new ones on a regular basis. Yet, my 6mos trimmer flat-lining was strange. Maybe I just got one of those one in a million bad motor and \\&quot;plastic internal piece.\\&quot; Anyhow, I did grab up another pair and I&#x27;ll stick with the Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer until Andis comes out with a good competitor. Their current \\&quot;new\\&quot; head to head trimmer does not OVERALL compare to the quality of the cut of this Wahl product. I just wish the longevity was a bit better. But, at the end of the day, it&#x27;s about stylin and profilin on the cheap by fading my own head. I figure I&#x27;m still saving BIG by replacing my Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer Powerful Rotary Motor Trimmer instead of dishing out 20bones every 2 to 3 weeks - the trimmers pay for themselves then I look at it that way :-)</li>
    <li> I keep my scruff trimmed up great with this. With the included guards I can go close or leave it longer evenly. Saved me tons of $ from not using a regular razor anymore. You won&#x27;t get as close of a cut as a rzor, but pretty close! Love that is a plugin instead of batteries so it never dies. Cord is pretty long too which helps.</li>
    <li> Powerful little clippers. Works well keeping the beard in check. The guards are a perfect addition.</li>
    <li> 110 voltage was sent to me here in Australia instead of 240 voltage. Only America uses 110. I was hit with considerable postage costs when I returned the trimmer and have since bought the identical item with a 240 voltage from elsewhere. Would think twice before buying from overseas again.</li>
    <li> Great buy! Really close shave and gives you a precise edge. This is worth the money. I&#x27;ve had this for about 6-months and still love it.</li>
    <li> After having to track it down for a 2 or 3 days.... It was what I looking for.  Worth the purchase</li>
    <li> This product has small size and it fits well in my hand. I saw other products and in the end came to deciding between the Wahl Hero or Detailer. I chose the Detailer as I was afraid that the bump on the Hero body would interfere with my hair cut. After seeing different videos on YouTube I felt that this has less bump than the Hero. The blade that comes with this product is the standard blade, not T-wide. I felt the T-wide blade being wider could be unsafe for a horizontal hair cut near ears. The body has metal screw inserts to hold the blade screws which may prevent it from breaking. There are some comments on Youtube that plastic bodies of old version 5-star Detailers that do not have these inserts break after some time (From YouTube reports it looks like the new ones have these inserts). Zero gap blade adjustment is easy. There are a few videos on YouTube demonstrating that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first time I used it, when I opened it to clean the inside of hair the white plastic part which holds the blade popped off and the spring came out. Here are the instructions to put the spring and white part back -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  If you removed all four screws then leave the bottom screws slightly loose and tighten the top ones to about 70%-75%. Hold the Detailer with left hand such that the part of the body with the Detailer name is away from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Note that there is a small black plastic piece protruding from part of the body towards you and there is a horizontal groove on part of the body that has Detailer name. The white plastic part has grooves on it (these are for the long arms of the spring) and a small hook (which goes in the horizontal groove on the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The spring is &#x27;J&#x27; shaped when seen from the side. Place the short arm of this &#x27;J&#x27; spring on the black plastic piece (on the case facing you). The long arms should be away from you. Slide the white plastic part in on the motor and make sure that long arms of the spring are in the grooves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Now, with the right thumb, press the white plastic part down enough such that the little hook on it would go under the horizontal groove on the casing (with Detailer name) when it is closed. Close the casing and tighten the screws.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. Work&#x27;s wonderful and does a great job. I&#x27;m glad I choose this trimmer over three other brands. This trimmer is now a part of the family..</li>
    <li> The only thing I wish is that it had a few &amp;#34;longer&amp;#34; plastic attachments for longer hair locations.  This is a great trimmer for short trimming and for precise trimming.</li>
    <li> Timely delivery..the clipper performance so far is second to none...high quality performance. I recommend this for home use n some professional</li>
    <li> Out of all the rotary trimmers that I&#x27;ve used these are the best that I&#x27;ve owned. They are sharp and precise.</li>
    <li> The Wahl Professional 8290 Detailer is a powerful trimmer. Especially for it&#x27;s small size. It is somewhat louder than some trimmers but that&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;deal breaker&amp;#34;. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;  I usually use the &amp;#34;Andis&amp;#34; line, however, I wanted to try something different and was impressed by the Wahl trimmer after checking it out via a video demo.</li>
    <li> For years I have been a dedicated Andis fan and I only used their products and clippers. I heard a lot of fuss in the barber community about these trimmers so I decided to purchase a pair. Let me start off by saying these by far are one of my new favorite clippers. When adjusted properly these clippers will give you clean crisp lines every time. They are very light weight and are only 5\\&quot; long so they are easy to handle. Don&#x27;t let the size fool you though they are a very strong professional tool.</li>
    <li> Best trimmer in my opinion.Perfect for shape ups and doesn&#x27;t irritate customers.</li>
    <li> so far best trimmer i&#x27;ve used i&#x27;ve used the wahl peanut for the longest,i feel like this one is like a step further, need to get t-wide blade though for some reason the burgundy one came with the t-wide blade but this one came with a pro blade adjuster wich is the bright side to this.</li>
    <li> Best Wahl Detailer because its small and lightweight. Its the perfect tool for the toughest cuts!</li>
    <li> The machine works smoothly and very fast, save time so we can handle more customers.&lt;br /&gt;They are happy, we are happy</li>
    <li> I bought this trimmers and i am very disappointed with the wahl&#x27;s trimmer 8290 it already broke tried to have it repaired by wahls and nothing i have called i have emailed nothing very saddened by the out come i truely liked the way they were working all of a sudden engine bogged down i thought hair clogged it so i went to clean it and put blade back engine moved slow like the power in a battery went dead it has a cord now it doesn&#x27;t wanna work the way it should please contact me at colon_reynolds@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> I have been longing to get a very good trimmer and I found it in the Wahl brand. It is great and affordable unlike some other brands and does as good a job.</li>
    <li> NOT AS POWERFUL AS I THOUGHT. PROBABLY WILL BUY ANDIS CLIPPERS NEXT TIME.</li>
    <li> I put the T-wide blades on mine and they work well. I love the fact that they don&#x27;t get hot like my Andis T-Outliners. I use them to line myself up and shave, so I adjusted the blades to get as close as possible without biting me, particularly around my neck. There are videos on YouTube to help with adjusting your blades to your tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great trimmer is the Wahl Hero. It&#x27;s smaller and it has a small hump on it that I initially thought was going to be an issue. However, it seems to be a great idea because it helps me hold it at the proper angle when using them.</li>
    <li> Recieved next day unexpectedly. Quiet, long enough cord, sharp. Very nice!</li>
    <li> For some reason mine doesn&#x27;t trim hair very well. Alot of times I just see the blade slide over hair without cutting any off. Not sure if its a dull blade or bad design, but it&#x27;s been like this since new.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite trimmers!.. Light weight, close shave and thanks to Super sonic delivery I got in two days!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fast and just as described. Will buy from again</li>
    <li> I have nothing negative to say about this purchase. Amazon is always my go to decision when I need to make an online purchase! No disappointment here...</li>
    <li> used. disgusting. had hair in the blades, and was just thrown in the box! I am so disappointed why shoukd i pay full price for simething used!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small,sharp and powerful...soo far soo good. I&#x27;ll check back with you after a few months of using them.</li>
    <li> I had a Andis which cut 100 times closer than this POS. Never gets close even when just trimming and lining up. Will never buy a Wahl again. Do yourself a favor and stick with Andis.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after reading the other reviews on amazon. My experience was not as pleasant. It di not cut very close and did more grabbing and tugging than I felt comfortable with. I tried to use the adjuster, but that did very little to help. Actually- it didnt really adjust the clipper blades- returned it.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetologist and have used these for years!  I love them,sharp, light weight and quite! my only complaint is after 3 years the cord rips from base.  I still buy more...  This is my second pair.</li>
    <li> I use this detailer almost every day to trim my hair because it does a great job, oh the price at amazon was a great deal.</li>
    <li> Great product. Light weight but mighty</li>
    <li> I did my WEB homework and asked barbers, they all coincided. It is an excellent product, I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> It cut better than the trimmers from Wal-Mart, but I returned it and got an Andis gtx.  Although, the Wahl will probably out last the Andis because it&#x27;s has a rotary motor.</li>
    <li> Great linners however Whal Hero is my favorite!</li>
    <li> Good and light ! Does not heat up</li>
    <li> They cut bald cut my hair last week and still don&#x27;t need a cut yet  a little pricy but let&#x27;s see how long they last I am happy it with them .</li>
    <li> Fast Ship, Nice Trimmers, Thanks</li>
    <li> Great clippers. Cuts real close after aligning them properly. Half the size of andis t outliners. Really light and quiet motor doesn&#x27;t heat up. These are my first Wahl outliners. I usually use andis outliners but I&#x27;m super satisfied and recommend these Wahl detailers.</li>
    <li> I use this to trim my beard and to line it. It works great and it great for a clean up when you do not want to shave. It is light and easy to use, the cord is long. Comes with 3 guards, 1/2, 1, and 1 1/2, also comes with a small brush and oil.</li>
    <li> Once they were adjusted these trimmers give you that professional finish. They are worth every penny. If you are a barber or aspiring to be one they are a must have to put you in the game.</li>
    <li> I love these edgers better than the wahl hero, its better to grip their quiter and cut more effective. I put the T-wide blade on the detailers and I feel like a left the barber. I highly recommend these edgers, and to get the T-wide blade. Warning if you get T-wide blade don&#x27;t zero gap them or you will slice and cut your head up. The blade is really sharp out the package. I am a wahl fan I by nothing but wahl products because their cheaper than other clippers.    Update 4/16/15 I currently do not use these clippers as a haeavy hitter anymore, I finally got my wahl hero adjusted like I wanted them, and they hit harder than the detailers, I still like the clipper.</li>
