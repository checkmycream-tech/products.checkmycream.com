<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! Best invention ever!</li>
    <li> very nice and saved me lots of time</li>
    <li> No more mess!  I&#x27;ve been looking for this product for a couple of months now and I finally found it at Amazon.  I love it, I use it all the time, now when I do my nails I have no more mess around my fingers. Very pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> Too small after 5 uses product is finished</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. Perfect for painting my non-dominant hand, which always ends up looking like a hyper two years old painted my nails. Finally no mess and my nails look clean! Smells like strawberries for some reason, but Im not complaining.</li>
    <li> Works good but oh my.. The smell 😳 It&#x27;s sickening.</li>
    <li> A manicure starter must have!!</li>
    <li> The liquid tape is extremely useful and the smell isn&#x27;t really that bad. Great product! I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time. Had slight problem with order but company, even though being in USA and me in the UK, respond straight away to my email and resolved problem fantastically. Great customer service. Would order from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is as good as the claims and makes creating perfect nails easier! Simple to use and worth it. Only downside for me is, I felt it had a strong odor. Definitely to be used in a ventilated area!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a product worth trying out for yourself. I was using glue before and find this product is so much easier to put on exactly where you&#x27;d like. Also, I think it smells pretty good. The only down side is the amount of stickiness. Don&#x27;t put it on two fingers next to each other. You&#x27;ll stick yourself together. I suggest one finger at a time. Otherwise, awesome product. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> It smells nasty, but works</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Liquid Palisade as well as this Mess No More. Liquid Palisade is so dang expensive, it&#x27;s ridiculous. Even though this product takes 2-3 coats, I would say it&#x27;s worth it. It dries pretty quickly and, if you apply 2-3 coats, peels off really well. Those of you giving 1 or 2 stars probably only tried 1 coat. Yes, 1 coat of this product will not work! THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE DEAL BREAKER, MY FRIENDS.  It&#x27;s affordable, works well, and is a good idea. I have one more tiny teeny con about this product that shouldn&#x27;t be a problem to most. I have shaky hands, so I get this stuff on the nails, when I only want them on the cuticles. Unfortunately/fortunately, this stuff dries clear (or light pink) so I don&#x27;t even notice until I do my water marble and then... POOF! the design is not on freaking half of my nail! But, hey, that&#x27;s my fault! Because it dries clear, it would work perfectly as a peel off basecoat. I LOVE THIS STUFF! Remember, look at the glass half full, not half empty! :)</li>
    <li> Pretty cool stuff. Works great!</li>
    <li> Worked amazingly, smelled terrible.</li>
    <li> This product does well keeping the nail polish off of your skin; I just find it incredibly difficult to take off. If you have any rough skin around your nail it won&#x27;t come on in one single peel. It also makes the nail polish flaky when coming off so you have tiny pieces of nail polish flying everywhere when you remove it.</li>
    <li> It take to long to dry</li>
    <li> Works great but after I had purchased it, I found it cheaper on a different page. :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money for a different remover. This stuff is difficult to remove. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> My daughters love this!</li>
    <li> Very good for nail polish clean up.</li>
    <li> Works very well! Product arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Oh My GOSH does this stuff STINKS!  I threw it out  UPDATE:  My sister bought the same item and kept hers.  It does work, however after less than 30 days, hers completely dried into a glue ball INSIDE the tube.  Yes it was closed properly  There are a lot of other products to buy that do the same thing.  Save your money on this</li>
    <li> My twelve year old daughter loves this!  It does work well for keeping nail polish off the skin. It makes a twelve year old&#x27;s job look neat and perfect!</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! It&#x27;s a little difficult to get up at first but after a couple of uses it gets easier. (Just needed some practice!) Saves time and makes clean up so easy! And I&#x27;m not slathering my clients in acetone! (Always a plus)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, omg! Exactly what you need if you&#x27;re like me and get nail polish everywhere.</li>
    <li> The name &amp;#34;Mess No More&amp;#34; says it all. No more wasting time to redo the nail that went wrong .. It&#x27;s easy to remove once your done. I got 3 of those .. One for me and the others for my friends, and we just love it. Highly recommendable !! Just buy it !!</li>
    <li> Works amazing. First of all item arrived on time and as described by seller. It has a nice smell to it when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use it: 1. Apply base coat. 2. Apply this Mess No More liquid tape around my nail (be generous and do half your finger if you&#x27;re doing water marbling). 3. Apply whatever color nail polish. 4. Remove Mess no more liquid tape with tweezers before nail polish even dries. 5. Apply top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries very quickly so make sure you apply only 1 layer of this liquid tape because if you go over the same area twice the first layer will stick to the brush tip. Would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This product works as expected. It says to put on two coats and mostly it works, If it goes on a little thin you just need to scrap a little, then it peels off completely. I love it</li>
    <li> This stuff does work I love it, I tell all my friends about it does have a funny smell but it doesn&#x27;t last on your fingers I&#x27;m so happy with this stuff I also love the name mini mani moo so cute.  When I run out of the one I just bought I will be buying more. Thank you to the people who  invented this product its amazing.</li>
    <li> It actully keeps your finger policy free</li>
    <li> Its really good But one tube broke from underneth..</li>
    <li> Great product . Peels off easy and takes the mess with it . Very useful .</li>
    <li> I really hate the smell due to the latex, even though they tried to make it smell better... Other than that, it&#x27;s fantastic! Ps: obviously do not purchase if you&#x27;re allergic to latex!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping , I got exactly what was advertised .. thanks a bunch</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought I would</li>
    <li> Works very well! Exactly how it says in the instructions</li>
    <li> In order for it to work, I have to put thick coats, otherwise it&#x27;s very very hard to be peel off from my skin. For this amount to be used every time, this little bottle will not last long.</li>
    <li> It worked very good have seen it in videos but didn&#x27;t know it worked so good</li>
    <li> Was not as easy to use as I thought it would be.  I am willing to try it again and see if I can apply a thicker coat to make it come off in one strip.  It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> Delivered very promptly good product good organized for busy company!!</li>
    <li> I just got my package today, and I tested it out right away...it works perfect... I even tested 3 fingers, I applied one coat to one finger, two coats to another and 3 coats to the 3rd finger...each one peeled off super easy! Now, I do tend to have &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; skin in general, but the skin around my nails is pretty dry...so I hope that helps others looking to see if it will work for them. And as for the smell... it smells like amonia, but don&#x27;t worry, you only notice it if you stick your nose in the tube....trust me, your fingers won&#x27;t stink after its dry...it&#x27;s really not a big deal ;)</li>
    <li> I like this liquid tape, but it would be very helpful if it didn&#x27;t dry clear. It&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;ve got good coverage over my cuticles because of the clear color.</li>
    <li> Works just like it was promised to work.  Easy to use and arrived quickly. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect! Just add a little around your finger and then paint, it makes painting your nails quicker. In the package you get a set of nail stickers, I don&#x27;t recommend using those only because their REALLY sticky and it takes FOREVER for them to come off, but other then that great product overall.</li>
    <li> This product works very well, it doesn&#x27;t smell very good though.</li>
    <li> this stuff works great.</li>
    <li> I tried this immediately and it was super easy to use and did the job.</li>
    <li> Great product especially with nail art water marveling and sponging, makes clean up a breeze</li>
    <li> Well, yes, no more mess, ONLY if you can accurately put it around the nail. I can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, there is no better feeling then ordering something and it does exactly what it claims. I have used this a couple of times already and the clean up involved is minimal.It is easy to use and easy to remove.</li>
    <li> This product does not work as described. Back to using q-tips &amp; polish remove...</li>
    <li> This works perfectly!!</li>
    <li> Now I can make pretty nails by myself:)</li>
    <li> The product itself is excellent. It peels right off when you pull it. Although I believe that if its tip were paintbrush like, applying it on the skin would be easier.</li>
    <li> Very good but needs to have 2 coats and it&#x27;s not the best smelling thing</li>
    <li> Although you have to be extremely careful when applying it so i doesn&#x27;t get on your nail, once you have master that, the job gets done as promise and it is quite easy to hace your mani and pedi time at home!</li>
    <li> Works great but smells terrible! Use in well ventilated areas!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Cheaper than most of the similar products out there.  My only complaint is that it takes a few coats.  I love that it dries a dark pink too, very easy to see.  The applicator tip is perfect too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised. It does not roll off easy</li>
    <li> Great product. Literally no more mess!</li>
    <li> This product works like a charm for me when doing nail art gradients and ombré designs. Perfect for easy clean up.</li>
    <li> Ok but not that easy to peel off</li>
    <li> Works great, 13 year-old daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like what you see in the nail art videos! My nails came out looking great!</li>
    <li> Product works great! Peels right off with tweezers. Wish it was a slightly bigger bigger container for the price and the smell was a little more pleasant though...</li>
    <li> might as well skip using this all together because I had to go back and clean my cuticles and fingers with nail polish remover. Even using more than one coat, it just peals off the nail polish on your nail. I</li>
    <li> Great product but smells awful. Doesn&#x27;t work with gel nail polish but it works for regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This stuff really works.  This is going to be my go-to tool for when I paint my nails.  This stuff is amazing.  I wish I would have known about something like this sooner.  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> The product works, but I think it would be better with a brush applicator instead of a sponge. It&#x27;s hard to be precise with the sponge.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. I liked it when I first got it. When I came back to use it again the tape was completely dry. It was all stuck together and ruined the brush. The container was in fact closed tightly. It&#x27;s okay for the money, but I would not recommend it if you don&#x27;t use it daily.</li>
    <li> This product works perfectly!  I applied the 2 coats as suggested and did a sponge application of polish and the mess around my nails peeled right off! Product dries very quickly and the odor does disappear rather quickly too (as is stated in the instructions.)  I really like the sponge tip on the applicator, it made applying the product very easy and I had more control of placement compaired to using a brush tip applicator.  I will purchase again when my supply runs low!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift as I do a lot of nail art and it works fine for keeping polish off the skin around your nails but doesn&#x27;t seem real useful for nail art as you&#x27;ll likely ruin the art trying to peel it off. I&#x27;d also like to mention that I did a test run using this on my right hand and Elmers School glue on my left in the same manner and got the same results.....and Elmers school glue costs about $1. It would also be faster (and cheaper) to just clean up with a small brush and some polish remover.</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time and works great. Once my bottle is empty, I might try another liquid tape called &amp;#34;simply peel&amp;#34;. Some people say it works better but I wanted to try. By this product works very well.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this product. It really makes cleanup a breeze, no more getting nail polish on my skin when I paint them:)</li>
    <li> Awesome my nails are easy to paint. No mess!!! Recommend!!</li>
    <li> Perfect liquid palisade. Love the applicator. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad and goes away one the product is dry (about 1-2 minutes)</li>
    <li> Came in on time And works well.</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s so practical!!!!</li>
    <li> No need it is not good</li>
    <li> Great item fast shipping works awesome I love this product great price highly recommend for a easy clean up 😃</li>
    <li> It works amazing! I have freedom to use my nail polish as often as I can.</li>
    <li> Love it!, works great</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Does exactly what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do! Although one thing I would change it instead of the applicator being a lip gloss sponge be a brush for closer cuticle contact!</li>
    <li> This really works.  Makes clean up much easier.</li>
    <li> Love it! Works perfect!</li>
    <li> Is not too bad but dry it si quick</li>
    <li> May work well with regular polish, but does not clean up easily with gel.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to apply and works very nicely, I&#x27;m glad I bought it. I love doing designs so this is perfect when things get messy.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm!!! The instructions were very easy and it peeled off in one nice piece!!</li>
    <li> I apply 2 coats and it comes off easily. plus it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell</li>
    <li> Couldve used Elmers Glue &amp; saved myself $20.</li>
    <li> My niece got this for free to try, and we were excited to try it out. She cleaned her nails and then sat down to put this on. It is so thin it was too easy to get on your nail. Then once she switched hands, it was sticking as she tried to apply to the other. Almost all of it ended up coming off before we even started applying any polish.&lt;br /&gt;We decided plain old white glue will still be what we use!!</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Kind of expensive but works goo lower the price ad I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Love it. It&#x27;s so nice and easy.</li>
    <li> Works amazing. Seriously. Stop messing with tape and use this. It peels off like glue. In one big strip. I don&#x27;t ever have to worry about mess anymore around my nails. And the shipping was super fast. I think I got it in like 2 days after ordering. I will be buying from this seller again. This is my new favorite product. Especially for my daughter who&#x27;s trying rub my things with her nails. This is amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this forever! It&#x27;s an exceptional product and shipping was so fast! Will definitely be purchasing again!!!</li>
    <li> I honestly thought it would be a lot better. It kind of works.. but it&#x27;s actually really messy. Luckily the glue doesn&#x27;t stick to anything you wouldn&#x27;t want it on but doing my nails all my fingers kept getting stuck together which was very annoying. I rather clean them up afterwards then apply this. It&#x27;s an annoying extra step. Not buying again.</li>
    <li> To my surprise this item works really well!</li>
    <li> The product smells like rotting flesh.  There is no package information nor list of ingredients, when or where it was produced.</li>
    <li> Works really well, but has a very bad smell.</li>
    <li> This product is extremely helpful for those who always apply nail polish messily. I highly recommend. Even if you don&#x27;t struggle painting your nails the process is faster so you&#x27;re not as careful to get over your cuticles.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok just smells weird and is harder to use</li>
    <li> I just got my parcel and it turns out nothing inside :( i feel very upset as i was looking forward to use this product. I have no idea what went wrong but now my order is gone! 😓 i received the package with two holes and when i opened there is nothing inside other than that paper 😓</li>
    <li> This is a good product but it comes off in many pieces. I prefer to use Bliss Kiss Latex. It works a lot better.</li>
    <li> I am completely satisfied with both the product and the shipping. The package arrived early and the product is easy to use and very effective. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Works great, but after ordering this one I found several other options where you get MORE for the same price (10ml vs 4oz). They&#x27;re not the same packaging, but function the exact same way.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for ways to make this  ,but it&#x27;s easier just to buy this. Works  great</li>
    <li> When my package got lost in the mail, the company was so helpful and sent out another one to me right away! I&#x27;ve used this product twice already since getting it about a week ago and I&#x27;m in love! It has made clean up so easy! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> Yes very happy with it</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.easy to use and does the work.</li>
    <li> Mess No More requires a precision that makes it unnecessary to use at all. If I had great ability to paint precisely, I wouldn&#x27;t need it. So it wound up making a mess with the polish - a different kind of mess than getting the polish on my cuticles. Instead, the liqid tape got where I wanted polsih, so it peeled off the polish on the nail itself.</li>
    <li> I wanted liquid tape so I could  try all the new ways to paint nails. This product is wonderful! If you&#x27;re in to water marbling or sponging or just want to stay &amp;#34;in the lines&amp;#34; this product is perfect.  I Will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come off cleanly and don&#x27;t like the applicator.</li>
    <li> Girls you got to have this</li>
    <li> not alot of product for the price smell stays on fingers</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this liquid tape! No more cleaning up the mess after trying to do your own nails. It&#x27;s affordable and works great. No need to spend big money on this! Pretty nails all the time!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it!</li>
    <li> I thought that this product could have been better. I opened it and it smelled terrible. Then I put it around my cuticles and it was very thin. It dried very quickly which was very nice however it came off very stringy and I had to try many times before the latex came off. The nail polish came off of the barrier so there was no use of using the product. It sort of worked at first. If this product was thicker and the application part was easier, I would like this product</li>
    <li> Not the best liquid palisade I&#x27;ve used. It dries almost clear and is hard to find the beginning to pull off. It also took some of my polish off my nails after I removed it and I waited until my polish had set (20 minutes).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the 1 &amp; 2 star reviews. This stuff works great. 2 coats and let it dry. It is thin but it makes it easier to use not harder.  There is a smell but does not smell after it has dried.  I&#x27;m excited to have this product in my collection.</li>
    <li> Love love it works magic it just takes awhile to take of</li>
    <li> Smells funny but it works great...I&#x27;ll buy more for sure</li>
    <li> When I go to peel the tape from around my nails it would pull the nail polish away from my nail or it wouldn&#x27;t remove the polish at all.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how I did my nails before I got this stuff.  It almost reminds me of when I&#x27;d put Elmer&#x27;s Glue on my fingers &amp; then peel it off when it dried, however this works much better!  I apply it all around my nail &amp; then polish them when the liquid tape dries.  I normally do a couple of coats &amp; then when it&#x27;s all dried I use tweezers to pull the tape off.  This way I don&#x27;t take a chance of smudging my pretty nails.  It works well &amp; is very satisfying!</li>
    <li> This product is so good. I ordered this sometime in June, so I&#x27;ve had time to work with it. Works really well with just one coat of the glue. It leaves your nails neat if you get a little messy with polish. However, you do have to work quick because it does dry very fast and you have to be careful to not touch your other fingers, toes or your skin because then it will pick up and start coming off. It does have a strong smell but I don&#x27;t mind it. Other than that happy with the product :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this product but it does the job! Just apply 2 nice coats, wait for it to dry and it peels right off with no fuss.</li>
    <li> It helps if you plan on doing gradients or stamping on nails.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly! For marble nails i recommend just to use tape:) Everything else you will need this product! :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
    <li> I in no way shape or form consider myself to be a nail artist. To be frank, I suck at painting my nails, but this stuff helps me &amp;#34;stay within the lines&amp;#34; if you will. It really helps me paint my entire nail without getting polish on my fingers.</li>
    <li> So glad I got this I make a mess when I paint Wish I had gotten more than 1.</li>
    <li> Works good but kind of expensive</li>
    <li> I got this for my 12 year old daughter who loves doing nails but hates the mess the polish makes around the nail bed. She tried this out and said, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s awesome!&amp;#34;  Definitely a great way to keep your cuticles clean while painting nails with sponges or other methods. This is easy to apply as it has a wand like a lip gloss and glides on smooth. The bottle is small enough that you could take it anywhere in case you needed to touch up your nails while traveling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to peel off as I thought, but it&#x27;s still pretty effective.</li>
    <li> This is a cool product. I bought it to try and the only complaint I have is that the applicator would be better if it was thinner or perhaps a brush, the tip on this one made it hard to get the edges precisely and got some on the actual nail, so when I peeled off it took some of my toe polish with it. Smells like a butt, but once it dries it goes away. I figure this is the same as elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
    <li> excellent product, love it. but stinks..</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. Had a bit of a struggle taking it of cause it was hard to lift but it did its purpose.  Just wish the bottle was bigger considering I do my nails everyday. Overall im pleased</li>
    <li> I love this! Easy to use and fast drying! Works just as well as liquid palisade! But 10-15 dollars cheaper!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product and I love it very much! I bought two of them already!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work quite as I expected, but still a good product. It helps to protect my skin from the UV light and makes clean up easier.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> a little messy but great for young girls to use on grandmas</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! The more I do my nails the better I get, but I always struggle making the lines above my cuticles nice and smooth.. Always ends up getting on my skin and doesn&#x27;t look as professional. Using Mini Mani Moo makes that&#x27;s problem completely disappear! And makes doing ombré nails easy to do without the mess! Did my nails using this product and then I have a pic of my nails without it. HUGE improvement!!&lt;br /&gt;Blue and coral Aztec nails is without this product, pink nails other ombré chevron and bow WITH this product! So amazing!!</li>
    <li> This product works great for &amp;#34;masking&amp;#34; off any part of your skin. I used it just the other day when tinting my eyebrows. I protectected the surrounding skin I didn&#x27;t want colored and saved myself from the painful scrubbing I always have to do to get the dye out of my skin afterward. I haven&#x27;t done it but I&#x27;m sure this product could be used the same way protecting your skin along the hairline when coloring your hair too. It washes off easily with warm water and light rubbing. Great multipurpose beauty item to keep on hand!</li>
    <li> Works as described. Helpful for small fingers.</li>
    <li> amazing, stuff it works</li>
    <li> Have to make sue u apply two coats before starting the nail polish, otherwise it will be taking forever to peal them off,</li>
    <li> Worked ok.  A little difficult to come off, as it does not come off in one or 2 pieces, I found myself picking at it with tweezers like an orange peel that just won&#x27;t peel.  Yes, it smells going on, but it doesn&#x27;t smell after it dries.  Sticks if you get your fingers too close together and will start to peel off if that happens before I apply any polish.  I would call this an OK product.  If you are allergic to latex, this is the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are NOT allergic to latex, I found that a latex based liquid tape (like Sassy Cat&#x27;s Kitty kaps latex liquid tape) works better for water marbling and stamping, because it comes off in ONE piece mostly (or one in a half).  I did not have to struggle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this &amp;#34;Mess No More! Liquid Tape for Pretty Nails&amp;#34; is a more cost effective product ($9 +S&amp;H),  than the natural rubber (ie..latex) based Liquid Palisade ($22 + S&amp;H), but for a more easily manageable AND cost effective product, I prefer the latex based brush on Sassy Cat&#x27;s Kitty Kaps Latex Liquid Tape ($7.50 per 7.5ml bottle &amp; $4.50 ship) from their website.</li>
    <li> this product works very well you just need to apply a good amount would prefer a different brush</li>
    <li> This stuff is WORST.. It&#x27;s over priced.. I found other stuff that way cheaper &amp; works wayyyyy better! This crap a smell to it as well.. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻</li>
    <li> This does what it says it&#x27;s going to do. The real problem I have with it is as you&#x27;re putting it around your fingernails, it&#x27;s creating little balls of stickiness around the opening of the container and on the wand. If you don&#x27;t pull them off, you will end up with them inside the bottle. If you don&#x27;t mind having to do that, then go for it. It does keep your cuticles free of nail polish.</li>
    <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose, but the formula is very thin and smells awful.  I think I&#x27;ll give the purple stuff a try.</li>
    <li> Im sure you could use elders glue in the same manner but this is way easier</li>
    <li> Very recommended! Easy to use and works well.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of this stuff, and the applicator wand in this particular version is better than the one that uses a brush (rendered useless after the first use) but I guess I need practice for application...it works, but there is still clean-up needed after manicure.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and remove, will save you lots of time and less exposure to acetone/solvents for nail art projects.  Applicator is perfect for quick swab coverage of skin surrounding nail.  Even when I waited too long to remove (after lacquer had dried), it still came off pretty easily.  If you like ombre and watermarble style nail art, this is a must have.  From here on out, this is a permanent item in my tool kit.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t  work like I have seen on instagram</li>
    <li> Works well, just wish there was more for the price it is.</li>
    <li> a little hard to use, but with practice, i&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on how clean my ombre is. super glad that i bought this. very worth the investment for anybody who likes DIY nails.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product, plan on getting another bottle in the near future.</li>
    <li> Not as good as another but worked good</li>
    <li> I really liked it but the one thing is that when you put it on it sticks to everything and peels off before you can paint your nails but if you do one at a time it works well</li>
    <li> This works great, I have problems doing my right hand nail. Now is much better will try some nails art.</li>
    <li> I just recently got started with nailart &amp; this was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased liquid latex. If you follow the directions (basically, put on your second coat before your first coat is dry), it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But BE CAREFUL when you&#x27;re pulling it off. I did an &amp;#34;under the sea&amp;#34; scene on my nail, complete with a fish, coral &amp; a sandbar, over a dry-brush background (took me, like, an HOUR to do all that stuff!), but when I tried to pull off the liquid tape, it snapped back into my wet polish &amp; screwed up my artwork. :/ But I&#x27;d consider that an O.E. (operator error) and not a product defect. lol The only reason I gave it four stars is because the angled sponge applicator tip makes it hard to get riiiiiiight up next to the nail bed and/or cuticle. If it had a brush applicator, it might be more user-friendly.</li>
    <li> It really works , i tried it and it works,  thank for making my life  simple.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter she loves it works great</li>
    <li> Thank you the product is amazing</li>
    <li> Product works great, it started getting clumpy on the applicator after several uses but overall I love it !</li>
    <li> It is useful but the liquid sticks to my skin to tight</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes for easy cleanup</li>
    <li> This product works wonders for nail art clean up! When you do gradients or water marbling, it gets everywhere. With this liquid tape it is easily cleaned up! It smells, but once it&#x27;s on your fingers it doesn&#x27;t. This product works and is amazing!</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! It smells bad but the smell isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
    <li> It works so well. Now I dont have to scrub with nail polish remover to get polish off the side of my nail :-)</li>
    <li> I received my bottle broken and the product spilling out so I couldn&#x27;t really tell you what is was like.</li>
    <li> Works really well. No more mess 👌🏼👍🏼</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> It does have a wierd smell smell before application but it does it the job. Espicially for water marbel designs. Happy with purchase &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I loooove this stuff.  Follow the directions and it works as promised.  No more mess from ombre manicures!  If you would like to follow my public instagram account to find tips, tools and ideas check out @manisandhammies</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it that it had latex in it, but it&#x27;s a good product if you&#x27;re not allergic to latex.</li>
    <li> Works great no more mess.. 👍</li>
    <li> Meh. Still going to try the purple one that&#x27;s all over the nailsphere - this one didn&#x27;t work as well as I anticipated. Very thin.</li>
    <li> In videos it worked great but when I got it and tried it, it worked but it is very hard to peel off. It comes off in a few rips and shreds but not in one pull, other than that it works okay.</li>
    <li> Good product fast delivery</li>
    <li> I orderd it to Austria and I am very happy with it! It came in time, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and to remove! I give all 5 stars for this product! Amazing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright but messy and doesn&#x27;t go on well</li>
    <li> COOL!!! Why hasn&#x27;t anyone thought of this before??? Would recommend to family and friends..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK but it&#x27;s just Elmer&#x27;s glue.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions to use the product. I did water marble when I did my nails. When I cames to peel off the product stuck on my finger. Only a small bit was there that I could peel.</li>
    <li> Perfect condition. Product is amazing. I use it for almost all of my nail art.</li>
    <li> awesome !! Loved it 😀</li>
    <li> I get pretty messy when I paint my nails. This really helps keep my manicure neat.</li>
    <li> This product is brilliant, I brought it as I&#x27;ve not got a steady hand so when painting my nails I used to get it on my skin but using mess no more has enabled me to be able to do my own nails again. The delivery was quick too</li>
    <li> Parfait. Produit génial. Livraison rapide. Je la recommande vivement.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect. Really good item sending in time. I recommend it</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Keeps the polish and designs off my cuticles when I do my nails...fun to peel off</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed to, just would recommend you do 2 or 3 coats of it instead of just one. One layer is hard to peel off.</li>
    <li> This product worked do well! I use it all of the time.  Just make sure that you let it dry for the amount of time said.</li>
    <li> perfect, they are just like I wanted them</li>
    <li> It works pretty well. 2 coats works the best. The lip gloss-like applicator kind of makes it difficult to apply in small amounts. It&#x27;s messy.Would be much better with a small, thin brush. Smells like fish, but it&#x27;s not strong so don&#x27;t worry about the smell. Although I would not buy it again. It is very expensive for just a small amount of liquid latex. You can find liquid latex for $10 for 4 ounces, without Ammonia, here on Amazon. This and liquid palisade are just overpriced products.</li>
    <li> Mess no more is a big help to do I g my nail.I am so grateful that I have this product and I will definitely be getting another when j need it</li>
    <li> Love this product Works very well</li>
    <li> Hated it.  Very messy, hard to remove after polish was applied.  Will never purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint?&lt;br /&gt;The brush doesn&#x27;t get as close to my cuticles as I&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in pen form or had a striping brush.&lt;br /&gt;But by far the best latex product I&#x27;ve used :)</li>
    <li> Elmer&#x27;s glue works better. Good idea though.</li>
    <li> Expensive,  shipping was forever and ELMERS GLUE for .99 cents works three times better. Really.</li>
    <li> Pros:  reasonably easy peel-off, especially if you put on 2 coats; keeps polish off your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  wand applicator is a bit awkward to use; color same as your skin, so hard to see to peel off; need 2 coats; very expensive for amount in tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried just using plain latex body paint and it works just as well, if not better.  You can pick a color that is easy to see and a whole 4 ounces for $11.  I put it into an empty nail polish bottle and used the brush to apply--works better than the wand.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work like it is suppose to at. I feel like I wasted my money on it. :(</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!!! I ombre my nails, A LOT and I can&#x27;t even imagine doing messy manicures without this stuff now. Saves SO much time!! Amazing product! 5 stars from this lady!!</li>
    <li> Took forever to ship so be patient but my daughter loved it.  I understand you can get similar results with Elmer&#x27;s glue but she says it isn&#x27;t the same.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! Really comes in handy when doing stamping or sponging polish on your nails, it keeps you&#x27;re edges clean. Not fond of the smell but it disappears after you apply it to your skin. Will be buying more soon.</li>
    <li> After a snow storm snaffu, this company made my daughter&#x27;s sadness, because it missed her Birthday, into GLADNESS, by sending her another one!  So, thank you, and she is LOVING the Mess No More Liquid-- and she&#x27;s doing all of our nails!</li>
    <li> This helped sooooo much with water marbling nail art which is the main reason I got it. It works soo well and is a great price compared to others I have seen.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my step Daughter who is all about nail design lately.  She LOVES this product and says it works &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase work perfectly fine</li>
    <li> Good product. Just what I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and product works a treat!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> This really works! It came in sooner than the expected delivery date. It&#x27;s thin, easy to use, and dries quickly! I will definitely buy this from the company again when and if I run out.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works exactly as described. Will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing and it works like magic. The first day I got it, mess no more wasn&#x27;t peeling off right but it takes a few days just to get working right. I recommend two coats of it the first couple times :) good luck!</li>
    <li> I have only used it once but it will be extremely beneficial for doing at home manicures. I have tried to be neat with polishing my nails but it is near impossible for me to do it perfect and it takes me almost an hour. I go through at least 3-4 double ended Q-tips cleaning up my cuticles and skin around my nails. I used this and I only used one side of a Q-tip. It takes time to put this on as close to the nail as possible without getting it on the nail but I rather do that than the clean up after. Plus I usually ended up messing up at least one nail when I was trying to do clean up. Using this I can try to be careful with the polish but whatever gets on the skin I can leave it until the clear coat dries and then peel it off. Like I said I have only used it once so far but I am a fan. I may not use it for nude or light colors but definitely for medium tone and dark colors which are the hardest to polish for me. Came quickly. Package appropriately. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I really like the masking fluid!  The product does exactly what I want!!!  It&#x27;s just the applicator that is lacking.  The product comes in a lip gloss tube with a lip gloss sponge tip applicator, while the tube itself is fine for dispensing, the sponge tip cannot get into the areas that you would need the masking fluid for!  I have deep curves around my nails and cannot get the sponge tip into the areas closest to my nail bed.  I currently use a separate brush from my nail art kit to apply the liquid, but that leaves the cap open and dries out while I try to get enough product on my brush.  And then it gets dried gunk on the lid.  I am really tired of cleaning up my cleaning product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would buy this over and over again, but only if there was a better applicator.</li>
    <li> So happy! It came in the mail sooner than expected. I tried it immediately and loved the result of it and how easy it is to apply! Definitely worth the money and now I can use glitter without problems!</li>
    <li> Came on time, not really sure about this liquid tape it didn&#x27;t completely dry. Could have been my error, I don&#x27;t know if I used to much</li>
    <li> Other than the smell, its great stuff!</li>
    <li> This actually works!!!  I wasn&#x27;t sure when I ordered but it works great!  Would recommend this product!!</li>
