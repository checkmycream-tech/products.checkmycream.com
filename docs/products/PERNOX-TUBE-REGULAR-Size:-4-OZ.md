      <li>I use to be able to buy this at Drug Emporium till about 8 years ago, like so many they went of of business.</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
      <li>I am so excited I look,and look at the mirror!</li>
      <li>It smooths and exfoliates so that make-up goes on more easily.  </li>
      <li>Best exfoliater,  because it uses micro poly beads as opposed to ground shells as some other products do.  </li>
      <li>My older grandson loved it.</li>
      <li>I wish they would make the lemon in the bottle available again.</li>
      <li>From all the products available, my dermatologist recommended this one.</li>
      <li>Those that are available on Amazon has been scalped to the highest price that can&#x27;t be afforded anymore by me.....</li>
      <li>It keeps me skin clear and bright.  </li>
      <li>It is very effective at deep cleaning every trace of oil and grime off</li>
      <li>My face has never felt so clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>Originally I used it to treat my adolescent acne.  </li>
      <li>It leaves skin feeling clean and silky.  </li>
      <li>It was a quality product then and helped clean my face thoroughly.</li>
      <li>and always use this with a light touch .... gently!!</li>
      <li>Pernox is awesome for faces with major break outs or just occasional zits.</li>
      <li>Just wish the price was more reasonable.</li>
      <li>My skin feels really clean and fresh when I use it.  </li>
      <li>To all the loyal users- what product have you found??</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Pernox for over 20 years - I&#x27;ve tried to use other cleansers, but nothing works as good at keeping my skin blemish free.  </li>
      <li>When I first started using this scrub, I fell in love with the grainy, sand-like texture (similar to my favorite scrub in the Olay Microdermabrasion Peel Kit) and the concentrated consistency.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I have tried many products off the self that don&#x27;t have a professional grade exfoliate.</li>
      <li>Pricey but worth it</li>
      <li>Pernox is well worth the price.</li>
      <li>After 30 years of acne, I have finally found one that works: it keeps my complexion clear and it works great.</li>
      <li>However, there is a slight odor that isn&#x27;t too pleasant, but its worth using.</li>
      <li>My skin is left so smooth and clean!</li>
      <li>Now that I am older, I use it once a week for a clean re-surfaced, fresh faced look...</li>
      <li>I have VERY oily skin and at age 62 my skin is clear, smooth and wrinkle free.</li>
      <li>I first used Pernox over 30 years ago.</li>
      <li>It is great for oily skin secondary to medication.  </li>
      <li>but Lemon Pernox is my favorite facial scrub ever!!</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
      <li>This scrub has more of an astringent quality than it does a creamy or emollient nature (people with oily skin will especially understand what this means).    </li>
      <li>I revisited the product recently and was pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best facial exfoliator I have found -- very grainy, so it scrubs the dead skin</li>
      <li>When I was a teenager, I washed my face with Pernox two to three times a day, and my upper back once a day, to successfully control and prevent acne.</li>
      <li>I started off using it twice a day when I first got it</li>
      <li>Thank you so much!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since 1969 and have never found a better facial scrub.</li>
      <li>It leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh like no other soap or cleansing product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It helps keep my skin very clean and my pores very open.</li>
      <li>Keeps mine clean and clear.</li>
      <li>It smells good and it takes very little each time you wash.</li>
      <li>an effective and powerful scrub - try a small amount VERY GENTLY at first.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff---it really works and keeps my skin clear like no other product.</li>
      <li>I have found it keeps my face free of pimples and sores with a daily usage in my morning shower.  </li>
      <li>This really is</li>
      <li>Very abrasive but not scratching.</li>
      <li>It can be very drying.</li>
      <li>charging $99 is a real rip off.  </li>
      <li>Its the real deal.</li>
      <li>I bought this scrub, but was very spectical even after, I read the reviews.</li>
      <li>Now I use it to keep my face looking fresh and young.  </li>
      <li>Tried many other &#x27;scrub&#x27; type products over the years.  </li>
      <li>Wait a few days between each use at first and slowly increase usage to what is best for you without irritation or redness. ....</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be scared by the price - a little goes a long way and it is an extremely effective product!    </li>
      <li>It is also good for scrubbing deodorant off, which is very hard to remove and can build up and cause discoloration.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend if your skin breaks out.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend Pernox.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll clean pores very well, but not necessarily make them smaller.</li>
      <li>It leaves my face with a new polish each day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Pernox for over 35 years. When I was a teenager, I washed my face with Pernox two to three times a day, and my upper back once a day, to successfully control and prevent acne. As a young adult I washed with Penox twice a day until my early 40s, and then switched to once a day as my skin grew less oily with age. I am 52 years old, but my skin looks like I&#x27;m about 40. Pernox contains scrubbing granules that remove dead skin, leaving your pores clear and open. It leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh like no other soap or cleansing product I&#x27;ve tried. Although Pernox has gotten expensive, a 4 oz tube provides me about 100 uses, so the cost per wash is still fairly cheap.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many, many years, and I like the results that I get from it.  It became difficult to find in drug stores, so I began purchasing it on line.  It is rather expensive, but one tube lasts about a year, so that isn&#x27;t too bad.  There is no other product that I&#x27;ve tried that works as well as this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Pernox for over 20 years - I&#x27;ve tried to use other cleansers, but nothing works as good at keeping my skin blemish free.  It is a little expensive, but it lasts for a long time, and it is well worth it.  I wish they would make the lemon in the bottle available again.</li>
    <li> Why has the price essentially tripled within the last year? There is no difference in the product, and it&#x27;s not carried (routinely)in local pharmacies. Is it going to be discontinued?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Smith</li>
    <li> Pernox facial scrub has been around for years. Now it is harder  to find and more expensive. It is great for oily skin secondary to medication.  Amazon has taken care of these problems..</li>
    <li> the size was advertised as 6.xxxxx oz and I  only wanted one not two so that got messed up somehow.</li>
    <li> I bought this scrub and liked it but Lemon Pernox is my favorite facial scrub ever!! I use it every morning and it is not like any other scrub. Pernox is awesome for faces with major break outs or just occasional zits. Keeps mine clean and clear. I have used it for over 20 years and now I buy it for me and my kids. You can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore so I was so happy to find it on Amazon.com.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this acne scrub for years.  It keeps me skin clear and bright.  Please continue to sell it.  It is difficult to find.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my teenage grandson.  I&#x27;m sure it will work well if he uses it.  My older grandson loved it. Please, I don&#x27;t need 20 words.</li>
    <li> Pernox is great for oily skin.  It smooths and exfoliates so that make-up goes on more easily.  It leaves skin feeling clean and silky.  I love this stuff but it&#x27;s impossible to find in stores and some of the on line distributors are slow to deliver.</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product. Ever since she switched to Pernox face scrub, she has not used anything else.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pernox since I was a teenager and I love it!  Originally I used it to treat my adolescent acne.  Now I use it to keep my face looking fresh and young.  It&#x27;s like a mini-dermabrasion and acid peel every day!!  I placed my order and had the item within a couple of days!  Excellent service!</li>
    <li> Product works great for blemishes and oily skin.  Not too drying for skin either. Skin looks refreshed after using.  I highly recommend if your skin breaks out.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Pernox at our local drug stores until they quit carrying it. I was glad to find it on Amazon. It is great for clearing up acne and keeping your face feeling clean. However, there is a slight odor that isn&#x27;t too pleasant, but its worth using. You may also need a moisturizer after. It can be very drying. I like this product because I have oily skin and it really helps with keeping it dry (in my case not too dry.)</li>
    <li> I have been using Pernox for about 6 months at the recommendation of a friend who has been using it for about 15 years (and has perfect skin).  I&#x27;m nearly 40 and have tried just about everything to prevent breakouts.  Pernox has finally got things under control for me.  The texture is gritty but completely smooths skin.  I started off using it twice a day when I first got it and it did cause some drying so I backed off to once a day and that resolved it.  I&#x27;m back to using it twice a day and have no issues with dry patches anymore.  I can&#x27;t believe I had never heard of this stuff until now.  I only hope that Amazon never stops selling it.  I can&#x27;t find it in any stores!</li>
    <li> Best exfoliater,  because it uses micro poly beads as opposed to ground shells as some other products do.  It&#x27;s a product that has been around a long time. My dermatologist recommended it to me in 1977. I have VERY oily skin and at age 62 my skin is clear, smooth and wrinkle free. Can&#x27;t give it all the credit &#x27;cause I&#x27;ve always used sunscreen</li>
    <li> Been using this product for 30 plus years...NOW, I can not find it...!!!&lt;br /&gt;Have previously purchased from Amazon, SkinRx, Hocks, and now I can not find&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Pernox\\&quot;...??? Prices ranged from $65.00 to $70.00 for three (3) 4oz. tubes&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone have information on this product?&lt;br /&gt;Or is there a comparable product on the market?&lt;br /&gt;HELP</li>
    <li> From all the products available, my dermatologist recommended this one. I love it. After 30 years of acne, I have finally found one that works: it keeps my complexion clear and it works great. I have told EVERYONE I know about it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! Please put it back on the market. I have an entire wedding party looking to order. This product has provided excellent results on my skin.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff---it really works and keeps my skin clear like no other product. HOWEVER, I find it super-shady that Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals discontinued this product (which they used to sell for $20 a tube) and then chose to sell off what was left for $80 a tube! How does a company do that?! It would be like Hostess discontinuing Twinkies, but marking up what was left in the supermarkets to $80 a box! SHADY SHADY SHADY!</li>
    <li> pernox is a great product.  the 4 oz tube costs $19 at the most.  charging $99 is a real rip off.  Shame on you.</li>
    <li> I love pernox, have used it for decades,  unfortunately it has been discontinued from production so the prices of whats left , have been jacked up . I guess I wont be using pernox  anymore.</li>
    <li> I first used Pernox over 30 years ago. It was a quality product then and helped clean my face thoroughly. I revisited the product recently and was pleased with the results. Pernox is an abrasive cleanser for troublesome skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since 1969 and have never found a better facial scrub. Just wish the price was more reasonable.</li>
    <li> I was cursed with combination oily skin, and still break out even at age 32. The pernox is great. I just rub it in my face (smells very refreshing too!) and all the dead skin and oil is gone. My skin is left so smooth and clean! No more pimples!</li>
    <li> I have been using Pernox for well over 20 years.  Pricey but worth it, a little goes a long way.  My skin feels really clean and fresh when I use it.  Tried many other &#x27;scrub&#x27; type products over the years.  They don&#x27;t come close.  Pamper yourself, INMO, Pernox is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00123IF9C Pernox Scrub Cleanser Tube For Oily Skin, Regular - 4 Oz]] Best bang for your buck. My complexion has dramatically improved in the year that I have been using this product. My face has never felt so clean and smooth. Once a day application with a moisturizer is all you need. One 4 oz tube lasts 7-9 months. Ignore the oily skin desription, anyone can use this product. A little goes a long way. My husband has started using it, too!</li>
    <li> When I first started using this scrub, I fell in love with the grainy, sand-like texture (similar to my favorite scrub in the Olay Microdermabrasion Peel Kit) and the concentrated consistency. It is very effective at deep cleaning every trace of oil and grime off my skin- my face literally squeaked when I rubbed it after washing. After a week of use, however, I noticed that my skin was drying out and starting to look unhealthy. After doing some research, I believe that this may be due to the cleanser disrupting the pH balance and natural acid mantle  of my skin and making it too alkaline. I think that this cleanser is too harsh to use every day so I only use it once in a while to deep clean my skin and prevent product build up from silicones and other waterproof ingredients. It is also good for scrubbing deodorant off, which is very hard to remove and can build up and cause discoloration.</li>
    <li> I have used pernox for over 40 years.  When I was a teen I needed it a few times a week.  Now that I am older, I use it once a week for a clean re-surfaced, fresh faced look...it works...I have contacted the Ranbaxy and was horrified to hear they have discontinued it and have no info on any more to come....RANBAXY, you are hurting so many people that have used your product for years and years...people write the company and beg they to re-instate making this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself.  I use it about 3 times a week.  It helps keep my skin very clean and my pores very open.</li>
    <li> Pernox is  a product I have been using for years. It was the best product i could find that replaced Listerex scrub when I was a teenager. If there was a drawback it was the funky smell that it had,but I could look past it because it worked so well. Now the price is 295 .00 a tube . Crazy!  I&#x27;m looking for an over the counter replacement. To all the loyal users- what product have you found?? I&#x27;m almost out of Pernox and I&#x27;m going to have to find something soon. Help!</li>
    <li> If you want a serious scrub for your face and neck buy Pernox. It helps with breakouts and oily skin and it renews your skin within days.Others will notice the difference and will compliment you asking you what you&#x27;ve done to look so good. I recommend Pernox for anyone men and women alike with sensitive skin too. My doctor told me about it and I&#x27;ve been using it over 20 years. It has a mild drying effect, so if you have very dry skin it&#x27;s probably not for you. It smells good and it takes very little each time you wash. I don&#x27;t think anyone would be dissappointed!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best facial exfoliator I have found -- very grainy, so it scrubs the dead skin away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is it is a bit pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Pernox.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product of 40 years and my friends  ask about it and have ordered it.  I use it everyday in the shower since it rolls right off and my face is ready for the moisture lotion and the skin absorbs beautifully.</li>
    <li> This product has not attempted to be the cheapest but the best. None of the cosmetic companies hold a lite to Pernox. The manufacturer has not cut corners and the results show . I attended a monthly meeting in which I had not seen people for 30 days, all men, two came up and ask had I received a facelift. Its the real deal.</li>
    <li> Nothing compares to this facial scrub! Nothing! Don&#x27;t be scared by the price - a little goes a long way and it is an extremely effective product!    This scrub has more of an astringent quality than it does a creamy or emollient nature (people with oily skin will especially understand what this means).    This really is an effective and powerful scrub - try a small amount VERY GENTLY at first. Do not start out using this every day!  Wait a few days between each use at first and slowly increase usage to what is best for you without irritation or redness. ....and always use this with a light touch .... gently!!</li>
    <li> Pernox is a wonderful product,but why has Ranbaxy quit making it available. Those that are available on Amazon has been scalped to the highest price that can&#x27;t be afforded anymore by me.....I recently purchased a tube for $299.00 and never again. I&#x27;m forced to look around for other products that can come close to &amp;#34;Pernox&amp;#34; for a much more reasonable price range.</li>
    <li> I was impatient to order this product even though the cost was more than twice what I have paid in the past, but I really wanted it, and I could not easily find a cheaper tube.  Since then, I have found another source where the tubes cost what I am used to paying, so I hope to use that source from now on....</li>
    <li> Pretty good stuff. Slight smell, but you get used to it. Only need a pea-sized amount for face coverage. It&#x27;s expensive but it works. Would recommend twice a day application. It&#x27;ll clean pores very well, but not necessarily make them smaller. Slight reddening/drying effect, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> With my oily skin it is a must have product. I have been using it for 45 years. Nothing else compares. It is expensive and not generally available in retail outlets anymore but nothing else works as well at drying out, defoliating,  and cleaning my type of oily skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using pernox for about 20 years.  I started buying it at my local drug store and now have to get it via the internet.  I have found it keeps my face free of pimples and sores with a daily usage in my morning shower.  Thanks for the great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Giesler&lt;br /&gt;rg1213@hotmail.com</li>
    <li> I bought this scrub, but was very spectical even after, I read the reviews. But I thought to myself, if so many people took the time to review it, and testify it works it must be so. And now I add myself to the list! My big problem was my nose, its oily and looked yuki!  my nose has begun to clear, yaaaaay! I am so excited I look,and look at the mirror! So, glad I bought it, and I will continue to do so! The reviews helped me to decide in ordering, thank you everyone !!:)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 10 years. I use it daily. It is a bit pricey, but there is none other that I found on the market that exfoliates as well. This is not for sensitive skin. It leaves my face with a new polish each day. Very abrasive but not scratching. I have tried many products off the self that don&#x27;t have a professional grade exfoliate. I use to be able to buy this at Drug Emporium till about 8 years ago, like so many they went of of business. Excellent product would highly recommend to anyone looking for a strong abrasive for their face.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pernox for 50 years. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist. I was so upset when I could no longer buy it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please advertise with dermatologists.  I have tried just about all skin cleansers and this is the only one that cleans my skin without having to use a second product with it.  I highly recommend it for oily and acne skin, even as an adult. lc</li>
    <li> The product is always great but it is a task to find the best price and affordable shipping.  This was the winner.</li>
    <li> This is a great product; I&#x27;ve been successfully using it for many years and I will definately buy it again.</li>
