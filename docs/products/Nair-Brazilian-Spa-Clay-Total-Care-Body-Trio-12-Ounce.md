      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>The results were amazing.....</li>
      <li>I wish you could warm it up a tad.</li>
      <li>, THIS STUFF DOES STAY ON IN THE SHOWER WHICH IS NICE</li>
      <li>Waxing feels better than this stuff.</li>
      <li>and I would not recommend this for safe hair removal.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m thinking okay...</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>BE SURE TO USE IT IN THE SHOWER,</li>
      <li>This is okay.  </li>
      <li>Shaving is better</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and was astonished how smooth my legs AND bikini line were!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m just more comfortable with a razor and coconut oil.</li>
      <li>WORKS OK.</li>
      <li>Way better than waxing.  </li>
      <li>Pretty good product...</li>
      <li>I love being bump free.</li>
      <li>OK, I was SO excited abotu this prodict after reading all the reviews.</li>
      <li>Its easy.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to use.</li>
      <li>really easily (just from exfoliating).</li>
      <li>Does not have the strong Nair smell.</li>
      <li>i made a great review earlier..</li>
      <li>Loved my results, I left on maybe 30 secs to a minute more than they recommended</li>
      <li>Both the wipes and the gel smelled great and felt really soothing, but the actual Nair cream itself had a very strong, very “chemical” scent to it, more like something I would use to scrub the shower than something I would use on myself in the shower.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original</li>
      <li>I prefer the original Nair.  </li>
      <li>And, it lasted a full four days before I had stubble on my legs.  </li>
      <li>I had so much stubble even when I exceeded the appropriate maximum time limit.</li>
      <li>I agree with the lady below, this product was awesome and more of us should be giving Nair a 2nd chance and stop using Razors that can cause nicks and all of that money spent, not to mention shave creams!</li>
      <li>The 2nd time I let it process for about 5 minutes before getting into the shower, thinking more time would yield better results.</li>
      <li>Although i was lucky to get it on clearance...</li>
      <li>strong smell, and you don&#x27;t have a reaction to the ingredients (I have fairly sensitive skin and was just fine)</li>
      <li>Easy to use, fast, and no skin irritation</li>
      <li>Next time I will leave it on for more like 8 minutes and see how it goes!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s cheap, it works like a charm, and really takes no effort.</li>
      <li>Well worth it for a beach vacation.</li>
      <li>but I came up with my own substitute by using regular wipes coated with some oil of my choice and it works just as well.  </li>
      <li>With that said - BUY THIS RIGHT NOW AND STOP READING</li>
      <li>I got nice smooth skin in some areas, but others still had a little stubble.</li>
      <li>The second time I left it on longer and it worked great.</li>
      <li>This product was not functional in removing my hair, and I left it on for more than the amount of time indicated in the directions.</li>
      <li>but it works pretty well</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it worked but not comoletely.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty bug</li>
      <li>The first time I used it it didn&#x27;t burn, but it also didn&#x27;t remove all the hair.</li>
      <li>You have to use the wipes first then put the clay cream on and then shower off and then put the gel on.  </li>
      <li>my sin is so smooth and feels like a professional job.  </li>
      <li>AS IT IS MESSY, IT WORKS GOOD ON LEGS</li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the most expensive nair product (which is for good reason if you look a t</li>
      <li>I left it on longer and all the hair came off leaving me with smooth legs AND bikini area for the first time in YEARS.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It removes hair pretty nicely, but there are only 2 pre wipes in the box which doesn&#x27;t seem like enough to me.</li>
      <li>This product is pretty decent.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really get rid of much hair.</li>
      <li>THE SPONGE IS CHEAP AND TINY</li>
      <li>The smell is very agreeable.  </li>
      <li>, DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL</li>
      <li>Very disapointed with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I had bought this mainly to try on my super sensitive bikini zone.</li>
      <li>Is even effective on coarse hair, which I have had difficulty removing with similar products.</li>
      <li>This product is not the same as their sensitive skin formula it is much much better, I cannot use anything else.</li>
      <li>I do think it&#x27;s very cheap of them to give you so little wipes for that first step</li>
      <li>I was careful to follow the directions (including the pre-Nair-day test!) and waited for the maximum allotted time before trying to wipe off the stinky cream; it turns out that Nair works much better than it smells.</li>
      <li>It does take off the hair, but the cost of the damage to the skin is not worth it to me to be smooth shavin&#x27;!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s high quality</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommend, I will not need to spend practically 200 bucks to be waxed ever again unless they discontinue this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations</li>
      <li>I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I settled on the Brazilian Spa Clay Trio after looking at several of Nair&#x27;s other products because I liked the idea of pre-</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work completely!!</li>
      <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the cream on long enough but it removed the hair nicely but it grew back just as fast as shaving.</li>
      <li>Normally I have to shave my underarms every day, but this lasted two-three days.  </li>
      <li>I decided to use this product because I normally purchase the Nair Spa Clay hair removal in the shower (the tube with the brush).  </li>
      <li>BUT NOT DELICATE PARTS</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super important to apply a THICK layer..</li>
      <li>I then thought I would try it on my legs thinking the area previously used on is of course more sensitive.</li>
      <li>so confused why this has such great reviews.</li>
      <li>but i have very sensitive skin)</li>
      <li>and I did not suffer any burn reaction, my skin was smoooothhhh and the hair was completely removed!  </li>
      <li>First time I only used on my legs/underarms</li>
      <li>I used it exactly how I read the directions not only did it leave about 1/2 the hair</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far, I have used the Nair Spa Clay once, to remove hair from my underarms.  I have dark, med to coarse hair; I followed the instructions exactly but had to leave the product on for 12-15 minutes before I could wipe away the hair.  Didn&#x27;t completely remove all underarm hair but certainly removed a lot, if not most of the hair.  The smell is very agreeable.  It was easy to use. I will try this product again.</li>
    <li> OK, I was SO excited abotu this prodict after reading all the reviews. However, it just did not work at all for me. I have brown hair, not very thick, and I followed directions to a t. The first time I was conservative and did the 2 minutes before getting any wet, then at the 10 mark rinsed off with a cloth. Literally maybe one hair came off. The 2nd time I let it process for about 5 minutes before getting into the shower, thinking more time would yield better results. Instead, it slowly leaked from my bikini line to THAT area and burned it! It also burned my underarms, but not to the degree of pain of my netherregion. I had to use polysporin for the burning, and again minimal hair came off. I had plenty left, but threw it all away. This was a waste of money, and pain &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> Gave me a rash had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Tried it the first time and didn&#x27;t leave it on long enough. No results. Next time I will leave it on for more like 8 minutes and see how it goes!</li>
    <li> I decided to use this product because I normally purchase the Nair Spa Clay hair removal in the shower (the tube with the brush).  But they were out at the store so I decided to give this a go.  I had not shaved in a while and when reading the areas to use the product I decided to try it on my legs and arms.  The results were amazing.....my sin is so smooth and feels like a professional job.  Way better than waxing.  The buffer pad also makes a big difference.  The only downfall was the amount of product they supply you with.  The actual hair remover (used in step 2) is a lot but the butter pad (step 1) and the gel (step 3) are very small.  .</li>
    <li> Awesome! Have thick hair and its all gone!</li>
    <li> Great quality product!</li>
    <li> i made a great review earlier.. About the application process. Its easy.  BUT THE HAIR GREW BACK IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME AS SHAVING , not good</li>
    <li> Got rid of half the hair, but my skin as well.</li>
    <li> This product is good. I have very course curly hair (black) and was a little worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work. Well it did. Love it...my bf does too. Only downside is I needer full 10 minutes and was too afraid to do the inner set of lips...likewise i would be afraid for anal area.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Easy to use, fast, and no skin irritation</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super important to apply a THICK layer.. Otherwise it&#x27;ll be practically ineffective. It removes hair pretty nicely, but there are only 2 pre wipes in the box which doesn&#x27;t seem like enough to me. Burned my underarms so I&#x27;m not doing that again, but it worked well everywhere else.</li>
    <li> I bought this to save money on waxing. I originally used this on my lady parts and it burned me really bad, there was even some blood involved, I followed the directions closely and was miserable for about 48 hours. While it definitely removed the hair it was not a good product for me down there. I then thought I would try it on my legs thinking the area previously used on is of course more sensitive. I had it on my legs for approximately two minutes and there were marks that were burned and painful. I don&#x27;t consider myself to have sensitive skin and I would not recommend this for safe hair removal. It does take off the hair, but the cost of the damage to the skin is not worth it to me to be smooth shavin&#x27;!</li>
    <li> I prefer the original Nair.  This is okay.  It just doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original</li>
    <li> The regular Nair I usually buy is much better. I do not like the gritty texture of this. I&#x27;d rather squeeze regular Nair out of a tube. That is just my preference. This stuff works just the same.</li>
    <li> This product was not functional in removing my hair, and I left it on for more than the amount of time indicated in the directions. It also seriously inflamed my skin despite being branded as gentle on skin. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> For me this works. No burn feeling and no smell. I&#x27;m mixed with tan dry skin.</li>
    <li> Um no. This s*** burns. I had mega chemical burns and I followed the directions. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to do with the rest of it. Because I don&#x27;t want to go through that pain again.</li>
    <li> Works good but it is so cold when you goop it on. I wish you could warm it up a tad. Shaving is better but if you don&#x27;t have that choice this works well.</li>
    <li> Works smoother than any other method I have tried, and leaves my skin very soft and moisturized.  Only down side is that I used about half of the tub to do my legs, bikini area, and underarms.  Normally I have to shave my underarms every day, but this lasted two-three days.  And, it lasted a full four days before I had stubble on my legs.  Well worth it for a beach vacation.</li>
    <li> I was doubtful when I purchased this, but it worked much better than I expected! Is even effective on coarse hair, which I have had difficulty removing with similar products.</li>
    <li> I was looking for an alternative to the regular shaving with a razor, I don&#x27;t like waxing and I&#x27;ve tried the regular nair in the past and didn&#x27;t like the smell and didn&#x27;t think it worked that well.  However I saw this spa clay mix and decided to give it a go.  You have to use the wipes first then put the clay cream on and then shower off and then put the gel on.  First time I only used on my legs/underarms and it worked great!! Loved my results, I left on maybe 30 secs to a minute more than they recommended and I did not suffer any burn reaction, my skin was smoooothhhh and the hair was completely removed!  The second time I tried on my bikini line which I don&#x27;t remember if the instructions said not to be but if it does don&#x27;t do it! lol I didn&#x27;t get too bad of a reaction but I definitely got a lil burning sensation and quickly washed off and applied some cortizone cream and it cleared up in a few days so note to self I will never use on bikini line but will continue to purchase for my legs/underarms. I do think it&#x27;s very cheap of them to give you so little wipes for that first step but I came up with my own substitute by using regular wipes coated with some oil of my choice and it works just as well.  I&#x27;ve switched over to the pump though because I find it less messy and I get the same results.</li>
    <li> If you are anything like me, you have severely sensitive skin to ANY hair removal method from the knees north.  You have probably tried literally every single product that you could get your hands on and cried every single time you wasted another dollar and STILL got those annoying razor/chemical/rash bumps on the thighs again.  If you are like me... READ ON!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As stated above, I have tried almost every Nair, Veet, NoNo, Sally Hansen... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it! With that said - BUY THIS RIGHT NOW AND STOP READING REVIEWS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, there was the familiar tingle of chemical hair removal, and the slight discomfort that follows. No, it didn&#x27;t entirely fade away when I rinsed off the product.  BUT THERE WERE NO BUMPS OR REDNESS after using the hydrant moisturizer following my shower!  AND I even WASHED with SOAP after I rinsed off the Nair!!!!!! I have extremely thick hair, and it was not easily removed the first time out.  The second time I used the product (three days later) I left it on longer and all the hair came off leaving me with smooth legs AND bikini area for the first time in YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: tingle (well, duh, it&#x27;s a chemical!), does NOT stay on well in the shower, you cannot purchase the hydrant separately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: no red bumps!</li>
    <li> Ummm this IS the best nair product for hair removal. I haven&#x27;t the slightest clue why anyone on here hasn&#x27;t reviewed this product. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the most expensive nair product (which is for good reason if you look a t it&#x27;s actually contents). I don&#x27;t even need everythg that&#x27;s in it except the spatula and the sponge and of course the product no need for the moisturizers etc which by the way are excellent. This is the only product that won&#x27;t burn you. I have tried it on my legs, bikini, armpit and...not to be too personal but my rear as well in the nooks and crannies and everything. This product is not the same as their sensitive skin formula it is much much better, I cannot use anything else. HIGHLY recommend, I will not need to spend practically 200 bucks to be waxed ever again unless they discontinue this product. Thank you nair for making the world a less hair place without all the pain. God bless you lol</li>
    <li> It did work but i found myself using twice as much as i normally would have with other hair removal creames.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it it didn&#x27;t burn, but it also didn&#x27;t remove all the hair. So I used it again a couple of days later and I didn&#x27;t even leave it on for very long and it burned me so bad I was bleeding a little. I will never use again. Waxing feels better than this stuff.</li>
    <li> I even read the reviews before I bought this, so I can&#x27;t say I wasn&#x27;t warned. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton, and this was the cheapest thing I could find with the best reviews. To get to the point, it barely worked and somehow I still ended up with razor burn in spots, despite not using a razor. This stuff does NOT stay on in the shower, it&#x27;s a mess going down the drain, I used it for the longest time recommended and my results were still meh. In the end, don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> I just bought this product at a regular store and i was very hesitant. I used Nair years ago and it made me break out. This product, which was regularly priced at 13.99 at the place where i purchased it... but it was on clearance for only 3.50! I&#x27;m thinking okay... after all these years, i&#x27;ll give it a try and at such a price... ill go go for it! Let&#x27;s just say. I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be using razors for some time!! I was totally impressed! It didn&#x27;t burn, it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation (not only do i have skin allergies but i have very sensitive skin) it didn&#x27;t even smell bad! It tingled a tiny little bit, but nothing to complain about! I followed the directions and was astonished how smooth my legs AND bikini line were! No matter how thick or thin or long or short, it got it all! I agree with the lady below, this product was awesome and more of us should be giving Nair a 2nd chance and stop using Razors that can cause nicks and all of that money spent, not to mention shave creams! I got everything i needed in a little box! Although i was lucky to get it on clearance... After knowing what i do know, i would&#x27;ve gladly spent that 13.99. Only thing i wondered about was the wipes that you are supposed to use before you add the Cream. They only give you 2 wipes. I don&#x27;t know if you need them every time you use this treatment or if there is a place where you can buy just the wipes? Every girl must try this!!! And don&#x27;t worry about getting it wet when you get in the shower... It&#x27;s just part of the process! Easy peasy!!</li>
    <li> Solves my waxing despair!  I can get rid of the hair in those difficult places now without the pain, without ten minutes wait time and without the horrible old Nair smell.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again as soon as I run out.  Got rid of all my husband&#x27;s hair in the spot applied too. Just waited 5 minutes &amp; removed to find bare skin where thick hair once was!</li>
    <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the cream on long enough but it removed the hair nicely but it grew back just as fast as shaving. Not worth the extra work to me.</li>
    <li> Im so confused why this has such great reviews. Just tried it for the second time on my bikini area... Did it for the maximum time and my hair was inly 1/8-1/4&amp;#34; long... Very minimal hair removal. So disappointed idk what to do with this. Id rather sugarwax myself and deal with the pain than with this disappointment.</li>
    <li> I ordered this before a cruise in hopes that I wouldn&#x27;t have to shave my bikini area (7 days). I decided to try it out at home a week and a half before... I got rid of some of the hair but not everything. I ended up just using my epilator... which I try not to use too often because it hurts.</li>
    <li> I loved the idea of this product. I used it exactly how I read the directions not only did it leave about 1/2 the hair but I also had a bad burn in which I needed to seek medical help for in which my doctor said I am probably allergic to something in the ingredients but I could not find anything in the listed ones that i am allergic to. Which only food type extract is peach. I would have given a 1 star but did not want to hear from the company that would like my rating removed...</li>
    <li> I ordered on Saturday, received it on Tuesday! THIS PRODUCT IS AMAZING! I never use nair cause it never works. But this did in one try! Does not have the strong Nair smell. I left it on for 10 minutes and all the hair came off one try. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations but wow. This stuff is awesome.</li>
    <li> Works great.  The only depilatory cream that has ever worked for me without burning.</li>
    <li> Very disapointed with my purchase. Didn&#x27;t work completely!!</li>
    <li> WORKS OK. STILL MESSY JUST LIKET THE PUMP, THIS STUFF DOES STAY ON IN THE SHOWER WHICH IS NICE BUT IT SEEMS TO TAKE LONGER TO WORK.. THE SPONGE IS CHEAP AND TINY, DOES NOT WORK VERY WELL, USE THE SPATULA TO APPLY AND TO REMOVE. BE SURE TO USE IT IN THE SHOWER, AS IT IS MESSY, IT WORKS GOOD ON LEGS BUT NOT DELICATE PARTS AS IT BURNS.</li>
    <li> To my surprise it works and I will be using it a lot because the summer is coming up. Yay!</li>
    <li> This product is pretty decent. I had bought this mainly to try on my super sensitive bikini zone. I get razor burn and ingrown hairs really easily (just from exfoliating). I tried it and wasn&#x27;t completely disappointed. I got nice smooth skin in some areas, but others still had a little stubble. Nothing a razor couldn&#x27;t take care of. I used some on my legs, but that didn&#x27;t work as well. I had so much stubble even when I exceeded the appropriate maximum time limit. It didn&#x27;t work any miracles for me, but it might with some other people. Honestly, I&#x27;m just more comfortable with a razor and coconut oil.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in the time it says it needs to and barely took off half the hair</li>
    <li> Works great it you are patient. The first time I used it, it worked but not comoletely. I think I had left it on 4 minutes. The second time I left it on longer and it worked great. I love being bump free.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I use it all the time and it works beautifully. Prompt service and I will order again. Thank you</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me at all and they will not give refunds.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product... I was a bit worried about stinging etc but it works pretty well it can remove thick hair in only 10 mins!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with everything you need and it&#x27;s a pretty bug jar!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is the smell it&#x27;s horrendous...</li>
    <li> The product works but what&#x27;s up the expiration date. My box is expired!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a razor and foam gal (I&#x27;ve used guys&#x27; razors for years with great results) but always wanted to give Nair a try, as it looked much easier to use and less expensive than name brand razorblades. With spring (hopefully?) on it&#x27;s way to my part of the world I decided now would be a great time to give the goop a go. I settled on the Brazilian Spa Clay Trio after looking at several of Nair&#x27;s other products because I liked the idea of pre- and post- removal skin care. Both the wipes and the gel smelled great and felt really soothing, but the actual Nair cream itself had a very strong, very “chemical” scent to it, more like something I would use to scrub the shower than something I would use on myself in the shower. I was careful to follow the directions (including the pre-Nair-day test!) and waited for the maximum allotted time before trying to wipe off the stinky cream; it turns out that Nair works much better than it smells. All of my bikini line hair was completely wiped away without so much as a single tingle, itch, or spot of razor burn, and the hair in question was pretty course. My hair seems to have grown back just as thick as it started, but I had almost a week without stubble, which is much longer than the 2-3 days I get with shaving. If you can get past the (very!) strong smell, and you don&#x27;t have a reaction to the ingredients (I have fairly sensitive skin and was just fine) I totally recommend giving this a try. It&#x27;s cheap, it works like a charm, and really takes no effort. I only did my bikini line, but I still have a very large amount of Nair cream left for future use, and almost the whole squeeze bottle of after-removal gel. If there&#x27;s any down side other than the smell, it&#x27;s that they only include two pre-use wipes when there&#x27;s clearly enough product to have many uses!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice ang good it&#x27;s high quality</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really get rid of much hair. Didn&#x27;t wash off with water either. 👎</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this product zero stars! Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product does not work at all!</li>
