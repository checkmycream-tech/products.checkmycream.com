      <li>Nice smelling colonge, not to strong.  </li>
      <li>glad i found it on amazon.</li>
      <li>sure i love it</li>
      <li>Sent lasts pretty well through the day, for the price the cologne is good.</li>
      <li>vanilla is a safe bet, most individuals enjoy the aroma..</li>
      <li>It sells for much less than most popular men&#x27;s colognes, yet it delivers with a pleasant scent which is not \\&quot;too much\\&quot; of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like this because it&#x27;s light and a splash.</li>
      <li>the aroma brings back a lot of great memories.</li>

      <li>I first tried this cologne 15 years ago as a present from a friend and have loved it ever since!</li>
      <li>Just by chance I tried on Amazon and sure enough I was able to purchase it.</li>
      <li>This is a real man&#x27;s fragrance... !</li>
      <li>AS WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED IT.</li>
      <li>Product was, of course the real thing.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t return it either, stuck with something I really dont like.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t make an educated review on this product...</li>
      <li>I like Coty&#x27;s Vanilla for woman, but since my fiance&#x27; broke it off with me before this arrived, and I never received so much as a \\&quot;thank</li>
      <li>Love it, and can&#x27;t wait to combine with other juice.</li>
      <li>It is masculine while not being too sporty like its a deodorant, or too much like a woman&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent choice for any occasion!</li>
      <li>I use to wear this stuff in high school.</li>
      <li>My husband loves Raw Vanilla and is always pleased with it no matter when he gets it.  </li>
      <li>Decent standalone scent, but really adds a second dimension to others.</li>
      <li>its a pleasant fragrance..TIP: adding a small amount of baby oil prior on your skin prior to applying perfumes extends the life of your cologne/perfume.</li>
      <li>I only wish it was a spray, I&#x27;m too new school for a splash...</li>
      <li>naturally the latter is for females..</li>
      <li>Vanilla is a soft, somewhat musky scent with an obvious vanilla hint.</li>
      <li>It offers a discreet aroma that lasts as long as colognes 3 or 4 times more expensive.</li>

    <li> My husband loves Raw Vanilla and is always pleased with it no matter when he gets it.  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores where we live.</li>
    <li> Decent standalone scent, but really adds a second dimension to others. Currently wearing a spot on the wrists with a spritz of Prada Infusion on my collarbone. Does wonders for the \\&quot;soapy\\&quot; scent of the Prada; the sweet second whiff is great. I especially enjoy what the teak/bamboo/vanilla does for Burberry Brit. Love it, and can&#x27;t wait to combine with other juice.</li>
    <li> Product was, of course the real thing. Price was good and delivery was prompt. In relation to the price of the product, shipping was kind of pricey. No complaints</li>
    <li> Coty&#x27;s Raw Vanilla is neither expensive nor overpowering.  It sells for much less than most popular men&#x27;s colognes, yet it delivers with a pleasant scent which is not \\&quot;too much\\&quot; of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some men&#x27;s fragrances tend to be too overpowering, or offer something too pungent or too \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raw Vanilla is a soft, somewhat musky scent with an obvious vanilla hint. It is masculine while not being too sporty like its a deodorant, or too much like a woman&#x27;s perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent choice for any occasion!</li>
    <li> I like Coty&#x27;s Vanilla for woman, but since my fiance&#x27; broke it off with me before this arrived, and I never received so much as a \\&quot;thank you\\&quot;, I would have to assume he didn&#x27;t like it.  I really can&#x27;t make an educated review on this product...</li>
    <li> I like this because it&#x27;s light and a splash. I can put it in my gym bag and splash it on after my work out. I think a spray would bother the other people in the gym locker area around me.</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND FIND IT TO BE AS GOOD AS WHEN I FIRST DISCOVERED IT.</li>
    <li> I first tried this cologne 15 years ago as a present from a friend and have loved it ever since! It offers a discreet aroma that lasts as long as colognes 3 or 4 times more expensive.</li>
    <li> Not the kinda smell I want to walk around with.</li>
    <li> I guess for the price what do you expect, smells very cheap and almost nothing like vanilla. I couldn&#x27;t return it either, stuck with something I really dont like.</li>
    <li> two of my fave mens fragrances, the other is body heat by bodman</li>
    <li> Just in time, very good congrats!!!  sure i love it, now i smell better thar ever!!! ha,ha,ha.</li>
    <li> Not on par with the spray on...</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but my girlfriend LOVES it. That&#x27;s about the best you can say  about a scent. I only wish it was a spray, I&#x27;m too new school for a splash...</li>
    <li> I used this a number of years past.  I was not able to purchase it in my city.  Just by chance I tried on Amazon and sure enough I was able to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is a real man&#x27;s fragrance... !</li>
    <li> had the cologne before&lt;br /&gt;wife loved it then loves it now&lt;br /&gt;nice to see i can still purchase it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;russ</li>
    <li> I use to wear this stuff in high school. glad i found it on amazon. the aroma brings back a lot of great memories.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t judge it because you think vanilla if for women and men can&#x27;t wear this.  This is a musky vanilla smell that is great and women love on men.  just wish you could find it in a larger bottle</li>
    <li> hola i got this for my dad&#x27;s  b-day..its a soothing fragrance. he loves it and hardly asks for much in terms of gifts, nonetheless it was hard to locate at a mass merchandise retail store.  hence the glory of amazon. RAW VANILLA  can be compared to vanilla lace by victoria&#x27;s secret..naturally the latter is for females..however RAW VANILLA can be unisex if one was so inclined. Bottomline..vanilla is a safe bet, most individuals enjoy the aroma.. Makes a great gift for your loved ones and for you..its a pleasant fragrance..TIP: adding a small amount of baby oil prior on your skin prior to applying perfumes extends the life of your cologne/perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick service.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling colonge, not to strong.  Sent lasts pretty well through the day, for the price the cologne is good.</li>
