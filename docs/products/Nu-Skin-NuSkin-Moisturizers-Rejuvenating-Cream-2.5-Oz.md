<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used nothing else for decades. Love the way it soaks totally in (if you used PhBalance) For years people complemented me on looking much younger. Even Rejuvenating cream eventually can&#x27;t defeat Mother Nature.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because one person I knew is selling Nuskin, and posted that this cream won a  kind of award,  best moisture cream,  Sisly is even in the second place&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; But I am very disappointed when I  saw it, even worse after I use it . I feel my skin is dry,and hard to breath. I  feel I  put wax on my face , even could see white staff on my face.  I will not beleive Nuskin  products any more.</li>
    <li> Yes, this is THE BEST facial cream I&#x27;ve ever experienced, and trust me (I&#x27;m 53 yrs old) , I&#x27;ve tried them all, even the $300 ones  ... and they can&#x27;t hold a candle to NuSkin.  I NEVER feel oily, nor do I ever shine with oiliness.  This cream seems to have an intellectual mind of it&#x27;s own.  It soaks in, and works it&#x27;s magic wherever it NEEDS to  .. never making my face look oily or shiny.  My face never feels tight, just normal, and my foundation makeup works so much better after I&#x27;ve applied this rejuvenating cream first.  Also, my makeup cleans off easier later.  I used to have to search for a NuSkin rep to order products made by NuSkin.  Now, I&#x27;m SO HAPPY that I can just order from Amazon.  .</li>

    <li> Very Nice product and good on-line shop, very fast delivery. Very Good. Why need to write at least 20 words experience.....Anyway, I am very satisfied about this order/product/delivery/nice seller! (i use the NAPCA Mist + this cream as my massage cream, overall - feel good!!</li>
    <li> Last month I bought 6 pieces of Nu Skin NuSkin Moisturizers Rejuvenating Cream. However, after receiving them I checked each bottle without packaging and manufacturer date.  Could you tell why there isn’t any information about production and expiring date on the bottles?</li>
    <li> I have used NuSkin products for over 20 years.  This particular item really keeps your face hydrated and looking years younger.  I would recommend any NuSkin product to everyone!</li>

    <li> Pretty good product.  Not oily and very moisturizing.  However, I can only use it once in a while coz if I use it daily or nightly I notice that sometimes I get breakouts after I wake up in the morning.  So will use it on emergency bases for my skin when it needs good nourishing/moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Have used this product before. Really happy with it.  Leaves skin feeling soft and looking smooth with or without makeup.</li>
    <li> The cream is very rich. A little goes a long way. And it does what it says. There&#x27;s no sent at all which makes it great. I use it at night only because I find it more beneficial.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Prompt delivery</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two years. For the price, quality and the result, this cream is unbeatable. I also using nu skin galvanic spa gel as well. Love there products.  I am 28 but still need to show my ID when I buy drinks.</li>
    <li> Better price than I can get as a NuSkin dealer...same product</li>
    <li> Please note that a Sponsor Distributor ID# is not a promo code and it should not be posted and used freely, it&#x27;s against Nu Skin&#x27;s policy for a good reason. Would you want someone unethical to be your business partner? What if you like using Nu Skin products so much that you want to become an active distributor? If you use a Sponsor ID# from someone you don&#x27;t know, unbeknownst to you, you could get stuck with a business partner you hate for life. I had bought Nu Skin products about 5 years ago from a beauty salon and I love it. Now, I&#x27;m a distributor and have a wonderful sponsor distributor to help and guide me to grow my Nu Skin business. This might be the business opportunity that you&#x27;ve been looking for and it may become your future and retirement income one day. Please don&#x27;t throw it away lightly by signing up with a wrong distributor who we already know is unethical.</li>
    <li> I was waiting for more than 2 month, I call the carrier and doesnt know where is the product, I really would like to have my money refound since I never get it and is not my problem, I write before but no one help me out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and really love it. Very glad to be able to get it at such a good price.</li>
    <li> I have not opened it yet but have been using the product direct from NuSkin for many many years and that should speak volumes</li>

    <li> This product is excellent for dry skin. It absorbs fast and leaves face smooth. It is great for your neck too.</li>
    <li> Everyone in my house, my fiance, my son and me all swear by this product. Works on everyone and makes your skin so smooth without grease</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nu Skin for a little over a year. Thought I would try this particular cream.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased and look forward to seeing results as I have with each product&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased from them. So far, I love the feel when I apply it. Seems to smooth on&lt;br /&gt;easily in A.M. and I can&#x27;t wait for P.M. to apply again before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very joyful consumer</li>
    <li> I have used this product for approximately 35 years.  I am almost 70 and look at least ten years younger than I am.....as told to me by others.  Not a personal opinion!!!  Some people have even told me to lie about my age.....this is only a testimony to the product but I suspect beginning its use at a younger age would be the most beneficial.  I was 35 when I first tried it and cannot say enough about its effectiveness.  I use it once in the morning and once in the evening....very light....nothing heavy.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you try it....and I don&#x27;t even work for the company.  (:</li>
    <li> So far so good,  need a little more time to see results.</li>
    <li> Absorbs great non greasy mild if any fragrance.  Just the best I have found for the price.  Three more words needed..........done</li>
    <li> Moisturizes the skin without a oily look or feel. Skin looks hydrated after one use. Love this product! Yes I will continue using.</li>
