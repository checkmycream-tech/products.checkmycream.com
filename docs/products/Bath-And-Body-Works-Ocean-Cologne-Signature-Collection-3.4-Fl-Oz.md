      <li>I love the scent and so does he.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t decided which I like better; the bottle or the body spray.</li>
      <li>but I do wish the top spray piece didn&#x27;t leak if you move it</li>

      <li>Good buy compared to if I purchased it at the actual store.  </li>

      <li>I would compare this to Nautica Blue, Cool Water, and Polo Blue.</li>
      <li>I got this from the store as a set to try out something different, being a guy that buys 70 dollar colognes I didn&#x27;t expect much</li>
      <li>Ocean isn&#x27;t like other colognes because it doesn&#x27;t have that distinctly \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; scent to it (you know, like when you smell rubbing alcohol and you feel it in your eyes?)</li>
      <li>we looked at other places for this particular brand and the prices seemed to be double what we paid for it here!</li>
      <li>, she definitely buried her head a little deeper into me when cuddling hahaha</li>

<li> If you blind buying or getting it as a gift, GO for it.</li>
<li> but my girlfriend went crazy over it</li>

    <li> perfect! just as it is when in the  store.</li>
    <li> I honestly love all of the scents for the men&#x27;s at B&amp;BW. This is my second favorite next to the Twilight Woods. I bought this for my Father-in-law for Christmas and I know he&#x27;s going to love it!</li>

    <li> This product smells great.  Good buy compared to if I purchased it at the actual store.  Great deal!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s obviously not anything fancy.  For the price though its a good smelling cologne although after about and hour the scent dissipates and goes away.  Like i said in the title, for the money...not too shabby.</li>
    <li> I am very happy to have gotten it a a lower price and still at good quality. Fantastic! hope to buy again</li>

    <li> Mucho commentos! smelling like a million bucks for less than $30 --one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine..</li>
    <li> Was bought at a nice price l, cheaper then the store but I do wish the top spray piece didn&#x27;t leak if you move it but other then the the product is great</li>
    <li> I have bought this for bf a couple of times here. It saves you a few bucks from buying it in person in store. It is definitely one of my favorite men&#x27;s cologne. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> This smell is my main scent I like to smell and seems like others like it also.</li>

    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend after smelling it at bath &amp; body works. We both loved it so I knew I had to get it for him. It&#x27;s about 10 dollars cheaper online and it&#x27;s legit. It lasts all day but its not overpowering. It&#x27;s a very clean smell which I love. I would compare this to Nautica Blue, Cool Water, and Polo Blue.</li>
    <li> I would not purchase this fragrance again.</li>
    <li> Smells great, not to overwhelming. Good for day-to-day use.</li>
    <li> In store at B&amp;BW this cologne is $35, I found it online for only $20 including shipping. Absolutely great bargain. Made for a perfect gift and it actually smells quite amazing as well. Definitely best bang for your buck. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
    <li> Your basic shower/light scent. If you like polo blue then you can beat this one for the price. If you blind buying or getting it as a gift, GO for it. Clean smell.</li>
    <li> i have been using this product for&lt;br /&gt;years very happy with the results&lt;br /&gt;one problem is the spray nozzle&lt;br /&gt;keep sticking  very trying but the&lt;br /&gt;fragrance ok</li>

    <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend for valentines day. It is an amazing price for this product. It smells great and fresh, NOT to heavy! I love the scent and so does he. I&#x27;m definitely going to order this again soon. Maybe I&#x27;ll keep it for myself. LOL.</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for my dad and it smells great. worth the price, definitely recommend it. great gift option.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product</li>
