      <li>When I was in high school a friend told me about Calandre, and how it was always her mother&#x27;s favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I have traipsed through many a department store, even Macy&#x27;s in New York with no luck.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was very happy to find Eau de Calandre at Amazon. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere for ages--must not be popular any more. Unfortunately, 3.4 oz was the only size available. Would have liked one I can carry on an airline. Delivery was very speedy.</li>
    <li> I usually get compliments when I use Calandre.  I first discovered it in Europe in the 1970&#x27;s and have never been able to find anything I like as much.  Wish it were easier to find in stores here.  The perfume is light and appropriate for everyday use, yet distinctive and sophisticated. I&#x27;d describe it as a light and greenish floral with oriental, bergamot undertones. While it is not sugary or fruity like some recent additions to the market, the green is not at all sharp and lemony, just mysterious!</li>
    <li> Very famous flagrance, very stylish and fresh.  A very good gift for a middle age woman.</li>
    <li> I bought Calandre 40 years ago and I have always remembered it as my favorite. The fragrance is fresh, crisp and long-lasting. My daughter who is in her mid twenties likes it too, so I conclude that it is a scent that can appeal to younger as well as older women.</li>
    <li> It was just as we remembered it from way back in the 1970s.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised</li>
    <li> love this old school fragrance</li>
    <li> The fragrance is light and airy...as beautiful as I remember it.</li>
    <li> Great seller. Product very hard to find. This is the only perfume my mother in law will wear. Glad it was available.</li>
    <li> The real deal. Lasts all day. I&#x27;ve worn calendre for 30 years. So glad to find it here. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Whenever I go out wearing Calandre, people ask me what perfume I am wearing!  This perfume is so fresh and light.  While I do wear others at times, I always come back to Calandre.  I highly recommend it for people who just want to wear a subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was dating a gentleman who wore the male version of Paco Rabanne. He asked me if he could buy this Calandre for me because he loves the fragrance on women. I decided to buy it myself.     Unfortunately I broke up with him before he got the chance to smell it on me... but everybody else who has been around me comments that it smells very nice.     I don&#x27;t like the smell when it is first sprayed on, but like any good quality cologne, it takes a few minutes to mingle with your body chemistry... and then it smells amazing.</li>
    <li> It has been many years since I&#x27;ve used this product.  It had been my exclusive scent for many years.  The present scent is not as I remember it.  Not at all.  I can&#x27;t imagine that I would have liked it back then if it smelled as it does today.  I was very disappointed and returned it.</li>
    <li> My grandma loves it, I don&#x27;t like this perfume though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;old lady fragance&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Used this scent in the 70s when it originally came out. Nice to see it&#x27;s been brought back. However this revitalized batch seems to have a much stronger scent than from what I recall. I liked it for it&#x27;s light soft smell. This one makes more of a statement. I&#x27;ll just use way less when applying.</li>
    <li> When I was in high school a friend told me about Calandre, and how it was always her mother&#x27;s favorite perfume. It smelled great on our friend. All of us girls went out and bought Calandre. It had become a favorite for all of us. I use to be able to buy it at the upper scale department stores. It is difficult to find now. Calandre remains my favorite. I am passing it on to my 2 girls for Christmas. I hope they like it too!</li>
    <li> It came on time. It&#x27;s just that it is not the scent that i like.</li>
    <li> I made my mom really happy for buying this Calandre for her as a surprise gift.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s her favorite fragrance since decades and she got really pleased!</li>
    <li> Always good service from Amazon.  Calandre is one of my favorite scents for day or night.  I am enjoying it right now!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came on the market. Always get a compliment. Haven&#x27;t seen it lately, so I&#x27;m rationing what I have left.</li>
    <li> Vey good price for a very good product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the longest time, this one did not have the same smell</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume for years, nothing comes close. I&#x27;m happy to see I can get it still. It was sent promptly and at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> BEEN WEARING THIS SINCE 1969.  COULDN&#x27;T FIND FOR A SUBSTANIAL PERIOD OF TIME AND SUDDENLY IT APPEARED.  NO OTHER SCENT LIKE IT.</li>
    <li> Paco Rabanne Calandre has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for years. It has been nearly impossible to purchase in this country. I have traipsed through many a department store, even Macy&#x27;s in New York with no luck. Last year, even the internet was unrewarding. This was a GREAT find, price was fantastic, and delivery was prompt. I was able to surprise my wife on her birthday.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for carrying Calandre! This was my signature scent for many years before I was no longer able to find it in Department stores.... I was totally thrilled to find it available through Amazon. My order just arrived and I could not wait to give myself a spritz. Smells as wonderful to me today as it did many years ago. It is a light, clean, classic scent that is not too strong or overbearing and will not fade away shortly after you apply it. I sincerily hope that it&#x27;s availability will continue because I would like Calandre to be my signature scent once again!</li>
    <li> The items I received were exactly as described.  The products came packaged as if I were to have purchased them in a store.  I am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why this cologne is not available virtually anywhere in the US; it seems to be available in the UK and on a very few US websites.  So I am happy to get it at all, since I have been wearing it since 1966!  However, since it has become scarcer and scarcer, the price has incresed dramatically.  What I used to pay around $35 for is now $75.  (And it wasn&#x27;t in 1966 that I paid $35; it was up until a few years ago--when I could buy it at the flea markets in Florida.)  So the price is the only thing that keeps me from giving this a five star review.</li>
    <li> This is a perfume is used to wear years ago.  I&#x27;m really glad I found it again...Amazon is Amazing!!! This is a great perfume that right out of the bottle, is sensual, soft and sexy!  Its really has a soft fragrance, but stays on a long time which is a problem I have with some frangrances! I&#x27;ve gotten alot of complements from this one!! I used it only on &amp;#34;special occasions&amp;#34;...well...mostly but I just love it anytime...</li>
    <li> Twenty-five years ago I used to wear perfume. After two decades of working in the trenches of child rearing, I realized that I missed my trademark scent... Paco Rabanne&#x27;s Calandre. When I decided to buy a new bottle, I discovered that it was nowhere to  be found. I searched everywhere for it...shopping malls ....airport terminals... knock-off stores-- still no Calandre. Finally, a light bulb went off in my brain and I logged onto Amazon. A couple of keystrokes later I found my elusive bottle of perfume! I placed my order and in under a week Calandre was at my door and on my pulse points.       Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s signature scent and hard to find.  Reasonable price. Great shipping.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a dear friend In Australia who absolutely loves this fragrance and could not find it.  It is not available where she resides. She is so pleased and feels it is her signature scent.</li>
    <li> Not authentic, made in Spain, totally different scent. Quite disappointed.</li>
    <li> This should have been a minus 10 stars - I have been wearing ONLY  Calandre for 30+ years on a DAILY bases. I always purchase my next bottle at the halfway point of my last bottle. I have never had the need to open the new bottle until the last is gone. When I did open it -  it was past the point of being able to return and it was counterfeit and a POOR COUNTERFEIT at that. whoever made it did not even attempt to get the original scent right; the counterfeit is so FLOWERY that I gagged at the smell. Paco Rabanne does not make Calandre anymore so the supplies must be gone and now there are only counterfeit out there. The Counterfeiters can easily copy the package, but not the scent. I think the counterfeiters are dupping the perfumeries  and they need to check out their suppliers and those suppliers need to check their suppliers.... I knew this day would come  - the real Calandre is gone....</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why this fragrance is not readily available in stores because every time I wear it, I always get compliments.  Unfortunately, I cannot smell it on myself, but I love how I know I smell when I wear it.  It is soft yet sexy and understated but distinctive.  Four of my friends wear it and we always talk about how much we love it.</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I was able to find Calandre on Amazon. It has been impossible to get, and I was down to my last few vapors. I find that Calandre has a scent that I think is sharp, high-pitched, a bit citrus and if it had a color it would be green. I also like Rabanne&#x27;s other old scent called Metal, which is even sharper than Calandre. These are not musky at all, not flowery, not sweet. not heavy. They last a long time on me, and when I used to drive to work every day, my kids noticed that my car smelled like Calandre. Rest assured, nobody else is using these scents any more, so you will be different. People always ask what I am wearing, and then tell me they couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I was using up my last bottle that I got in a duty free shop in London 8 or more years ago.....It is worth every penny. Some perfume websites will try to tell you that you will like one thing or another if you like Calandre. Not true. If you like Calandre, you will not want anything else, ever again. It&#x27;s like finding the love of your life.</li>
    <li> If you want a sickeningly sweet perfume that will repel everyone around you by burning their noses then this is the perfume for you. This perfume will ensure that everyone knows that you are the oldest person in the room.  Along with the exorbitant cost, I can only assume it is still around because there is a generation of women, now in their 80s, that liked really sweet disgusting perfume. As a bit of advice for all you women looking for a good scent. There are more smells than just sweet. Smells like lemon, or lime, or coconut, or cinnamon. Think fresh and clean, not sweet. You can google what smells men like the most, this is definitely not on the list.</li>
    <li> Happy and very satisfied, great delivery</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping.  I did not like the smell, maybe others will like it. It has that musky smell. I like a perfume that smells sweet flowery and citrus. However, if you spray this perfume on top of other sweet or flowery perfume, the combination is OK.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love Calandre! Have been wearing it for mega year&#x27;s and, poof,  it was gone! So glad to find it again!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20 years now. I never fail to receive compliments when wearing this.</li>
    <li> A scent I can&#x27;t live without!  I cherish very spray since it cost a fortune, but I was thrilled to find it.  Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> Every 4-5 years -- when the previous bottle finally runs out--I give my wife another Calandre.  Even at about $80 a bottle, that&#x27;s just a buck thirty-three or so per month to stay a hero in our house.</li>
    <li> The Eau de toillette was not the original nor the package and the smell was all evaporated: my experience with this product was not good</li>
    <li> I started using this perfume in my twenties,  stopped using it for awhile in my thirties and now I&#x27;ve found it again! I have always loved it! and always received lots of compliments on it. Thanks for having it available!</li>
    <li> This is not the original formulation that my mom wore in the &#x27;80s.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good or bad but it doesn&#x27;t work on me at all.  :(</li>
    <li> Received in good condition - enjoying use</li>
    <li> Have loved this perfume for 15 years now. A real shame it is no longer widely available anymore. It is light and fresh yet strong enough that you only need one or two spritzes to smell great all day long. Glad I was able to get it from Amazon. I was worried about the shelf-life of the perfume because as far as I know it has been discontinued, so I was concerned that it would have turned into a darker colour (It should be clearish)and would have smelled old in a gone bad sort of way. It did not however, it smelled pretty good.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume since I was a teenager; it has a very good fresh fragrance and when I use it people always has to say something nice and ask me what I am using to smell so extremely  good.</li>
    <li> The Calandre smelled just as it should -- fresh and beautiful.  Since it is so hard to find, I was afraid it might be stale or old, but it was exactly as it should be.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this again - I&#x27;ve used it for years but you can&#x27;t buy it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Wore this as a teenager so it is a return to golden youth. Smells as divine now as then!</li>
    <li> it is my very favorite, so you can imagine the disappointment when I opened the box and found a SUBSTITUTE perfume...I called and was told &amp;#34;oh, we don&#x27;t carry that.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Next time I will get the 1.7 oz so that the fragrance doesn&#x27;t turn.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Great gift idea.</li>
    <li> About 20 years ago, my aunt, who was visiting from France, gave my mother a bottle of Calandre.  It was such a beautiful scent, and on occasion, I would sneak into my mother&#x27;s room, and steal a spray or two.  On one occasion, I was able to purchase a bottle at Bloomingdales, but could never find it again.  Then by sheer coincidence, I check Amazon and was thrilled to find they carried it.  This is a timeless, classic scent--not heavy, not too light, evokes an innocence that is rare in most perfumes.  I hope Amazon will continue to sell this product, so that I can continue buying it for my mom.</li>
    <li> Thank you, thank you and thank you. This has been my go to scent for years and I now have a source. This fragrance is timeless and ageless. It also does not scare people away when worn in public. Terrific service.</li>
    <li> This is a subtle woody fragrance that has been discontinued by Paco Rabanne.  I&#x27;ve worn it for over 30 years and there were going to be a lot of unhappy people in my life if I couldn&#x27;t wear it anymore as the fragrance &#x3D; me.  So glad I found it on Amazon.  It was delivered in perfect condition and promptly.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for many years and loves it.</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume since my marriage.  I was thrilled to get it.  The price was excellent.  And it came on time.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this fragrance years go and remembered it so fondly I ordered it.  It gave me a huge headache!  It&#x27;s heavy with rose and just too strong for my taste.</li>
    <li> Good price for a hard to find fragrance</li>
    <li> I have loved this fragrance for forty years. The last bottle I bought was near the end and I no longer live near my fragrance shop. I saw it on Amazon and thought &amp;#34;yeah&amp;#34;! It is nothing like the wonderful scent it should be.. There is an unpleasant, metallic sort of finish to the scent. I looked into returning but found it couldn&#x27;t be done. I am stuck with an expensive bottle of disappointment.</li>
    <li> Scent was putrid.  Definitely not the same as the last one ordered.  Packaging was different.  Lettering was different.  Bottle stamped &amp;#34;Product of Spain&amp;#34;.  Tried the return route but, it is non returnable.  How about contacting me, Amazon.  You do read these, correct?</li>
    <li> I´ve been using Calandre for over 40 years. Sometimes when you order online the fragrance is not as I expect.  This time it came perfect!</li>
    <li> a classic classic perfume, good for the day activities not overwhelming aroma.</li>
    <li> It smells fantastic!!! Just like I remembered; I got my first bottle when I turned 15 and I&#x27;ve been using it for more than 40 years... The price is a bit higher than before, but I like it so much and it&#x27;s so hard to find Calandre that I am willing to pay extra.</li>
    <li> Paco has always been my favorite scent.&lt;br /&gt;so yes, it did meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> Have used for years. Best price ever.</li>
    <li> Different color, scent is different.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years, love it, it is floral and light. For every day use. Get lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for years and can only get it on the internet. I buy two at a time just in case. I will be crushed&lt;br /&gt;if it is ever discontinued.</li>
    <li> This has been my signature fragrance for many, many years.  I always get compliments when I wear it!</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent since age 16.</li>
    <li> I love this 1969 perfume if I could I&#x27;d wear nothing but this all the time.</li>
    <li> this arrived very fast, and the product is simply perfect, just as I remember it the packing is very nice and its a good price for this fragrance I was lucky to find it they don&#x27;t sell it everywhere.</li>
    <li> I love this cologne.  I used it in the past and could not find it anywhere.  Thank you, Amazon! I am so happy I was able to buy it from you. It is light and fragrant. I am allergic to all kinds of colognes,  but not this one.</li>
