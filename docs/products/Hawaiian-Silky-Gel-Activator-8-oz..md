    <li> This gel makes my hair sooo soft! My daughter is 3 with curly hair and it keeps her hair so soft as well! It makes her hair look so pretty when I do ponytails in her hair. But the jar is tiny for the price!</li>
    <li> For the price,  the jar was extremely small. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a Black friend .Since she requested it I will assume she loves it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived in good condition. Product was given as gift.</li>
    <li> Works wonders on my curl pattern. Provides great hold and lasts all day without flaking. I love this product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This product transforms my 4b hair into 3c hair and stays moisturized for at least 5 days.  I am on my second jar.  Love it. Love it. Love it. I would have never known about this product if African Export had not mentioned it on her YouTube channel. Thanks sista!</li>
    <li> Good ingredients, followed the directions, however left my hair sticky. I tried it alone, then tried it with the Hawaiian Silky Miracle Worker. Didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Gave both products to a friend and it works great for her!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t give it less than 3 stars because I&#x27;ve seen the results on other people.</li>
    <li> Tried to use for wash and go, but failed. I&#x27;ll try some other style with it.</li>
    <li> I used this on my short natural hair after spending a couple of hundred dollars on product for natural black hair. Finally found a product that works!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have the curl and the moisture that I needed. I highly recommend this if you are rocking a TWA, ladies! I&#x27;m hooked!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hawaiian Silky for a while now and I love it!! I have 4b hair and it has been the ONLY product that leaves my hair feeling soft and moisturized for days. I layer it first with Taliah Wajids curly cream and then Hawaiian silky. They are a great combination together. After I apply it I flat twist my hair and unravel it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I loved this product! Seen raved reviews on YouTube and tried it for myself... I&#x27;m a believer, so glad I decided to try it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my hair and it brings out the natural curl. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Waste of my money didn&#x27;t curl my hair at all perhaps is good for longer  hair.</li>
    <li> Too thin...and does not work on my hair type at all.</li>
    <li> Great product for natural hair. Very moisturizing. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I was a bit disapointed in this gel.  I had heard that it was wonderful to use on natural hair in a wash and go style.  While I did receive a nice curl pattern, the activator was flaky the next day.</li>
    <li> Quality of product Not what was expected</li>
    <li> It moisturizes my hair. It brings out my curl pattern. It has glycerine so I would use it more in the spring or summer more.</li>
    <li> this is a great product. I have tried all kinds of products for my natural hair. this gives a sheen and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair sticky.</li>
    <li> I am 50 years old and have been menopausal for sometime, now.  Menopause has made a huge change in my hair.  I stop relaxing (store brought relaxers) about five years ago, and only used Just for me Texturizers, but I still saw a huge change.  My hair became more dry, thin, and more tangled with each shampoo, even when I co-wash it... it tangled...I&#x27;m talking about tangles that took 6 hours to undo.  So I did the B/C and started from scratch.  My hair would be baby fine at times for two weeks then get&lt;br /&gt;a little course.  It was crazy, due to my hormones, but I have stuck it out.  I did the B/C in July, 2013.  I came across AfricanExport&#x27;s on Youtube because I was having trouble with moisture and she was waving about this product.  I had been using Long Aid, but it stopped working, it wasn&#x27;t keeping my hair moist.  The HS gel was sticky when I applied it to my hair, but after a day or two I noticed that my hair was moist, it was nice, I liked it.  Another thing I noticed was it is easy to wash out, and u can use it as a detangler.  It doesn&#x27;t define your curl, at least not mine... but it does give plenty of moisture during the winter months.  I am ordering my second jar, this time in the 16 oz at Ebonyline.com.  I really like this gel for moisture.  Thank you for carrying this product because if they don&#x27;t have it I can order it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb 7, 2014 UPDATE:  I decided to put some oil on my hair...and my hair was silky soft...the sticky feeling I had went away.  I had stopped using any oils or grease, just water and gel or any water based product like lotion or hair milk.  But the oil and the gel activator together works wonders.</li>
    <li> Great Product For Natural And Permed Hair! 😁</li>
