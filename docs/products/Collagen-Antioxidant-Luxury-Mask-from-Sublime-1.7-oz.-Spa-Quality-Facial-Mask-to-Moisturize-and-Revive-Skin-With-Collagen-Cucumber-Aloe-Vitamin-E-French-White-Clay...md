<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really like this mask. My face felt great after. Very soft and clean. The mask was very cool and refreshing. No irritation to my very sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> This product keeps your face looking soft and it smells delicious</li>
    <li> Beautiful package, and the cream feel great. My skin feel alive.</li>
    <li> This is a spa quality facial that you will not regret getting. It feels so luxurious, leaves your face smooth and clean and smells wonderful. It is cool and refreshing and I only wish I had known about it sooner. I would give it more stars if I could.</li>
    <li> My wife received this as a gift and has been raving about it for days. Even I noticed a nice change in her skin tone. Her skin looks and feels softer and smoother. I&#x27;m no expert on skin masks but this stuff really works well. She will definitely be ordering this again. She highly recommends it!</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about purchasing this item because I have super sensitive and very dry (mature) skin.  To add to my concern,the glass container was shipped in a thin cloth bag tucked into the same box with a pair of shoes I purchased from Amazon.  The product came without instructions. (I found the instructions online)  The mask smelled a bit off to me, but I tried it.  WOW!!  NO ITCHING..no burning....great results.  I am going to investigate Sublime Beauty&#x27;s other products because I use G.M. Collin, a Canadian product, which is great--but very expensive. This mask is a superior product at a reasonable price and most of all IT WORKS!!</li>
    <li> Just got this the other day and have only used it once, but so far I love it. Has a nice, creamy consistency that goes on easily and is not messy. When it drys it doesn&#x27;t crack all over the place like some do. Easy to wipe off, and leaves your face feeling smooth and refreshed. It is a little pricey, but sometimes you just have to treat yourself...i mean it is your face! Maybe I will change my mind after I see, or don&#x27;t see,  the long term effects of using this product, but as of right now I am satisfied.</li>
    <li> My wife just loves this product.</li>
    <li> I use this mask as a rotation to my clay mask, love it!</li>
    <li> I love the feel of this mask. My skin felt amazingly soft and smooth when I took it off.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works. I used it about 4 times now, and I see no change. Maybe I am supposed to try it for a really long time and it has an effect after chronic use, but I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was wonderfully done though. Visually very stunning and comes in a its own hoity toity little white mesh, see through draw string bag. I think it might serve as a nice gift. I personally did not see any change after use.</li>
    <li> I have recently had some lazer treatments on my face for younger more vibrant skin.  I am 51 and when I began using Sublime Beauty only 6 months ago, I saw such a difference in my skin that I wanted to go further.  Because of Sublime products I am certain that is why my skin took so well to these procedures.  I healed very fast from the heat of the Lazer and had minimal blemishes after each treatment.  Even my doctor was impressed enough to ask me my face regimen.  I told him Sublime Beauty.  We talked about the ingredients in the products and my daily and evening routine as well and he agreed they were superior among others out there that are even on the high end you find in department stores.  One of my pleasures were putting on this mask.  First of all it felt cool on my warm heated face and second I knew it was healing as well.  I love all of Sublime Products.  They started me on a path of great looking skin and a whole new level indeed.  I feel it is the very best out there.  Try this mask.  You will not be sorry you did.  Start using there line and begin seeing your skin in a whole new way.  The best.  Thank you Sublime Beauty for everything.  Sherri</li>
    <li> Rich, creamy, dries nicely then easy to remove. It left my skin a little dry immediately afterward so I would recommend  a good moisturizer afterward.</li>
    <li> Love this mask. My skin feels smooth, soft and I noticed my pores shrunk and I just have an overall healthy glow and brighter complexion since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful packaging of product. Used once and it goes on nicely and cleans off easily. My skin felt dry afterwards, but added Sublime Vitamin C Serum. I am looking forward to next spa treatment at home.</li>
    <li> I got this in my sample box first...awesome! It definitely restores glow and reduces pore visibility. Easy on, easy off, not uncomfortable to wear while watching TV and unlike most masks of this type, It washes off cleanly without leaving a greasy residue.A little goes a long way so I&#x27;m not having to replace every other week, VERY generous amount, AFFORDABLE and as usual, top quality ingredients - I am never scratching my head with Sublime products ingredient list.Everything in it has a specific purpose and is visibly effective immediately. A+ mask! I use it twice a week and it keeps me looking beautiful,young and fresh! My son can and does use it as well...pores and blemishes incredibly reduced. Another Sublime Beauty favorite!</li>
    <li> Background: I&#x27;m 49 and deployed. The water here is extremely harsh on hair and skin alike and I have been fighting with extremely dry skin for months. I went from clear skin at home to breakouts under my dry patches within weeks of arrival. Even worse, I&#x27;m seeing wrinkles and my skin is beginning to ... sag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product 3 times in the week since its arrival. Here are my opinions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  *The packaging was both lovely and environmentally friendly. The white mesh bag can be reused (think potpourri) and there is no product packaging to throw away until the product is gone. On that note, however, I recommend a much smaller jar for the tiny amount of product that is provided.&lt;br /&gt;  *The scent is almost indiscernible.&lt;br /&gt;  *The product is creamy and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;  *The mask drys quickly, but does not give your face the dry cracking feeling common with other masks.&lt;br /&gt;  *After each use, my skin feels soft and supple. I believe my forehead and smile lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;  *Con: The instructions/ingredients are almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass.&lt;br /&gt;  *Con: price vs. the small amount of product. I am being careful not to use too much at a time, but I love the way it feels so I&#x27;m using it often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first Sublime Beauty product I have tried and I am very please with it. I am considering trying their other products, specifically the COLLAGEN SERUM and REFRESHING CLEANSER. The only reason I hesitate is the cost. If I try them out, I&#x27;ll leave my reviews!</li>
    <li> This mask is great for all skin. It&#x27;s never too early to introduce antioxidants into your skin regimen. This mask comes in a cute organza bag inside of its box. I applied it to my freshly cleaned face. It doesn&#x27;t dry like a clay mask but imparts moisture. It goes on in an opaque white layer. You let it sit for about a 15 minutes. Then you wash it off. It leaves with softer more supple skin. I use this mask about 2-3 times a week. It can be used more often due to it&#x27;s moisturizing properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample Provided*</li>
    <li> Great product, works well with other sublime products . I like all the products I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
    <li> I really liked the way it felt on my skin.  I found it applied best with a flat foundation brush.  It was easy to remove with just water.  It felt really high quality and luxurious even when dry. My skin felt soft and rejuvenated after using the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone with combo to dry skin that wants their face to feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> This antioxidant mask came a beautiful container. It has a look of makeup brand in the market.  I really like the smell because it&#x27;s not too strong like other mask I&#x27;ve before.  It a sensation when on face, then I feel skin tighten.  I usually the for about 10_15 minutes then wash face off. My facef feels refresh and clean and vibrant, after using face mask. I was fortunate to came across this face mask during a promotion, I really like this and really happy with the result it gives mym skin.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product at a discounted price to test and try it out then leave an honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Great mask. Washes off good and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or hard on my face. The packaging is beautiful!</li>
    <li> This mask is quite lovely! It increased the moisture retention in my skin. I used it a few nights a week after my regular cleansing but before moisturizing. It seems to work for my combination skin without causing breakouts. I was able to try this product at a reduced price but I would definitely purchase again at full price once I am out</li>
    <li> I like this face mask, leaves ur skin feeing nice and clean</li>
    <li> Like a spa treatment. I could tell the difference in my skin with one use. Looking forward to the results after continuous use.</li>
    <li> Best. mask. Ever.  First of all, it came in a tulle bag , like a cute little gift.  The jar is equally pretty.  The mask has a great scent to it and is sooooo creamy and easy to spread across my face.  While it&#x27;s on, I can feel my face tightening (yes, fully aware that the feeling is from the mask drying).  That feeling is noticeably evident in my skin&#x27;s appearance when I wash off the mask and stays for a long time. I use it twice a week and have been getting compliments about how great my skin has been looking and how much younger I appear.  I would not hesitate for a single second to reorder this!&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  My opinions have in no way been swayed by that discount.</li>
    <li> leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.  love this mask!</li>
    <li> I have loved everything that I&#x27;ve tried from this brand. Great product!</li>
    <li> I use it every it, but not feeling</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I have used it twice and it makes my skin feel and look much smoother and younger.  It is easy to apply with my hands or a brush.  In addition, the customer service is very good.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Love it, makes my skin softer and younger looking!</li>
    <li> This Collagen Antioxidant Mask is beautifully packaged. It was recommended to me by a friend in the US and as I live in the UK I was surprised how quickly the product arrived. I bought it for my wife and she says it is lovely and it has a luxurious feel to it that makes her skin feel really clean and soft. So it does the job. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Super Mask - got for my wife</li>
    <li> My 5-star review does not do this product any justice. First of all, I still can&#x27;t get over the packaging. I have over 550 (!) purchases from Amazon, and this particular product sticks out in my mind because of how beautiful the packaging was. The only thing better than the way this product looks is how it works. As a beauty junkie and salon owner who has tried an endless amount of facial masks, I have to say that this is hands down in my top 2 products, the other one being three times the price of this particular mask by Sublime Beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Comparable to expensive, high-end beauty products. It is literally a luxurious weekly spa treatment in the comforts of home.&lt;br /&gt;- Incredibly nourishing. My skin remains moisturized for hours after I have already removed the mask.&lt;br /&gt;- Acts as an exfoliant to leave skin feeling smooth and soft by clearing away dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;- Very revitalizing for skin. My face is always brighter and my skin is always more radiant after each treatment.&lt;br /&gt;- Suitable for all skin types. I have sensitive skin, and this collagen mask did not cause any irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;- Light, pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;- Packaging is amazing. Would absolutely make a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Jar is a little bit small. I love this product so much that I honestly don&#x27;t want it to end. Fortunately, I only need to use a dollop at a time, so this should last me at least a couple more months.&lt;br /&gt;- Price can be off-putting. A little bit scary to buy a beauty product from Amazon that is priced higher than some department store brands, but take my word for it... it is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Make my 60+ skin feel so good and it glows after using this!  My skin is so sensitive, I kind of wondered.  But no problem.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This mask is comparable to ones that are used in high end spas.Skin looks refreshed and well hydrated after weekly use.</li>
    <li> First of all, I LOVED, LOVED the way this anti-oxidant mask was wrapped.  So luxuriously gorgeous, that I just sat back and had ti take it in for a minute.  Would make a wonderful gift for a bride (and in fact will end up giving this to my future daughter-in-law).  The scent was pleasant and not over-bearing at all.  I was able to buy this at a promotional price, and wish I could have bought more.  Absolutely lovely product that any woman or girl would love to receive as a gift.</li>
    <li> I have been using a few of these products for over a year now. I was buying Avon products, but now that I am using sublime I will never go back! I love everyone of them!</li>
    <li> I use this once a week on sunday evenings to get myself ready for the week ahead.  Its quite unreal the difference this has made in my skin since i started using it.  I use it to steady myself on sunday to relax and treat my face and I have began to see the big difference it has begun making.  I notice that my tone is more even and the smoothness of youth has started to return.  I recommend this and have bought some for my sisters in law who are wondering what I have been up to since they are noticing a slight glow to my skin.  thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for an honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I started using Sublime Beauty products awhile ago.  I&#x27;ve been using them one at a time so I could tell what each one was doing.  They each had wonderful claims, but I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money over the years on products that claim a lot of things and haven&#x27;t delivered, so I was skeptical.  I am glad to say I have been more than impressed with each of the products I&#x27;ve tried.  Each one has really delivered on what is says it does.  I&#x27;ve used facial masks before but most of them left my face feeling tight.  I have dry skin.  The Luxury Facial Mask really did do several things it claims.  First of all, my skin did feel more moist after using it; not dry or tight at all.  Second, my skin really did have more of a glow.  As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin doesn&#x27;t naturally glow like it used to; it had become more dull.  While my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, it does feel moist and glows.  I have read that collagen, aloe, cucumber and vitamin E are all good for my skin, but whatever combination they&#x27;re using is working.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product three different times.  We went to visit family we hadn&#x27;t seen in nearly a year, and several of them, at different times, commented on how good my skin looked and how I looked younger, and two of them were guys who definitely wouldn&#x27;t say it if they didn&#x27;t mean it.  That to me is an anti-aging product working successfully.  I can really tell a difference over time with the Sublime Beauty products.  Most other products from brands including Estee Lauder, Lancome, Bobbi Brown and Borghese have made my skin feel good, but I didn&#x27;t see the difference in it I am seeing with these products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 7 - Update.  I have continued to use this face mask and the texture of my skin has continued to improve.  In addition, I have not had to use much product each time, so I am pleased with how long the product is lasting.</li>
    <li> This is the best facial mask I have ever used!!  I put it on and 10 minutes later I was still waiting to dry...because what we have all been used to is the dry hard feeling when a mask dries on your face.  When I felt it after 15 minutes it was dry but moist!  I washed it off and it came right off not like other masks that I have to almost scrub off because it has hardened on my face. My face felt soft and was hydrated after. I have used it twice and am still using the product that was in the lid. This stuff is going to last a long time!</li>
    <li> This mask leaves my face refreshed and vibrant! It does not dry or crack, it leaves your skin feeling nurtured. I like applying it and resting while I drink some tea. It makes me feel relaxed and pampered. This mask is like no other...</li>
    <li> I cannot say enough good things about this collagen mask. It arrives in a sheer fabric bag. The jar is beautiful,  and it looks great on my vanity. The mask itself makes my skin feel amazing. It&#x27;s fairly thick (see photo), but feels airy when applying. It goes on so evenly without much effort at all. It has a very light, fresh scent, probably from the cucumber (see the photo I took of the ingredient list if you&#x27;re curious). When it dries, it doesn&#x27;t make my face feel stiff like other masks. It&#x27;s almost like when you apply liquid foundation, and it dries but you can&#x27;t feel it on your face. When I rinse it off, my face feels so smooth and hydrated. It doesn&#x27;t leave me with any tightness or discomfort,  just super smooth and hydrated skin. I try so many skin care products, and this one is at the top of my list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review -</li>
