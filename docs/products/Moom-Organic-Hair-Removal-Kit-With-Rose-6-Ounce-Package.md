      <li>It was easy!  </li>

      <li>Works great and rinses quickly and easily with just water.</li>
      <li>I love the lavender one, for whatever reason, I feel that it works better.</li>
      <li>I recommend, as many reviewers have stated, heat this product as stated.</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t paid to review this product :-)</li>
      <li>Make sure you read the instructions.  </li>
      <li>I bought this at ross and love the hell out of it, when I ran out</li>
      <li>I also think they should give more strips for the amount of product.</li>
      <li>I like this and if I could get better at using it, I would probably give it 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product, however, it ran out prett fast.</li>
      <li>I am really satisfied with this product.</li>
      <li>love it</li>
      <li>Have used both the original and the Rose Essence and don&#x27;t notice a difference between the two.  </li>
      <li>More importantly, my daughter likes it.</li>
      <li>Sooo easy to use....</li>
      <li>Removing the wax off your slin has never been so easy.</li>
      <li>Nice smooth legs for her and the residue washes right off in the shower.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using any kind of product like this (wax, sugar, etc).  </li>
      <li>It was easy to clean up.  </li>
      <li>The hair was gone and my skin was silky smooth.</li>
      <li>I had a pain free experience with the product, and it&#x27;s quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This wax smells nice and is definitely high quality.</li>
      <li>I was nervous at first, but everything is OK</li>
      <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
      <li>So, best case scenario, I can sugar wax with this every 25 days, but of those 25 days only 9 days would I be without hair or red bumps.</li>
      <li>But worth every penny and safer than having a salon wax you.</li>
      <li>It got here on time and it was definately worth the price.</li>
      <li>I love how gentle this product is and doesn&#x27;t cause me any type of irritation after using, but mainly it gets rid of the hair.</li>
      <li>so it wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
      <li>maybe i just didn&#x27;t do it right</li>
      <li>First of all because it doesnt hurt or irritate my skin, and second of all because it smells amazing.</li>
      <li>In fact, it leaves your skin soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know, it was my first time</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what is says.</li>
      <li>Well it is certainly sticky.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very effective and if anything is left behind, it could easily be dissolved with water, not with synthetic solutions.</li>
      <li>and you are ready to use.</li>
      <li>/&gt;- Only heat it for about 15 seconds, stir it and give it a chance to cool off&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it still pulled out maybe half of the hair after many applications</li>
      <li>My skin had the same soft and smooth feel after both.  </li>
      <li>Did OK for my first time, I usually get this done at my hair salon, but the prices are going up and up plus the tip.  </li>
      <li>My skin was left smooth and soft and the hair gone.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s not messy!!</li>
      <li>The first real wax product I could actually use myself and see the results.  </li>
      <li>And you have to make sure your face is absolutely dry, with no oils or it will definitely not work.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I have a few tips.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m very hairy with DEEP roots), but that&#x27;s normal with any wax.</li>
      <li>I like the gigi hard wax or cirepil soft wax much better.</li>
      <li>However, I used the whole jar, and it was barely enough to do both my legs, from knees to toes.</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that is dissolves with water, no more sticky mess.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended &amp; will definitely use again.</li>
      <li>I would recommend reheating it after the first leg (if doing legs) or 20 min of use because it&#x27;s harder to apply and stickier when it&#x27;s cooled off.  </li>
      <li>Because its simply sugar and other natural soothing ingredients, it rinses right off and doesnt leave any sticky residue.</li>
      <li>and I had red bumps for a week despite it being for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive, so I guess that is not much of a surprise.</li>
      <li>I think the problem is not so much the wax but that I can&#x27;t get down the technique to do it properly.</li>

<li> Just warm your jar in the microwave for a few seconds and spread it on thinly.</li>
<li> I have relatively thin but dark hair, and I have a huge problem getting any waxes or similar products to actually stick to my hair well enough to pull it out.</li>
<li> Note that this scenario is probably not different than it would be for waxing, and I would prefer this to waxing if it was the only other option, but I don&#x27;t think I\\&quot;ll be using this again.</li>
<li> I use it for my bikini area and it barely hurts compared to other products!</li>
<li> I would highly recommend using an ice bag on the area for at least 1 hour off and on to minimize redness.</li>
<li> My only complaint, is that it&#x27;s a little funky smelling, but I&#x27;ll get an unscented one next time.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and wouldn&#x27;t consider any other product.</li>
<li> Extremely please with this product and the seller.</li>
<li> I estimate that will take about 2 weeks, since human hair usually grows</li>
<li> Actually it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
<li> I will not use any other hair remover product.  </li>
<li> Using this product without heating to thee recommended temperature causes a mess.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also used this on my bikini line (also cold) and it works really well.</li>
<li> It did the job, yes I did have to go over again in a few areas</li>
<li> It took a few times to master maxing with this product.</li>
<li> Left all the hair behind.</li>
<li> If you live in a cold area, all you need to do is heat it in microwave for 5-10sec</li>
<li> I was very disappointed as most people seem to swear by this</li>
<li> but in part I blame myself for I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;mj using it correctly.</li>
<li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried other wax kits in the past</li>
<li> I was not very impressed with this product.</li>
<li> Now one of the nasty part of growing older is the ability to grow hair in places that never were a problem before.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, it also didn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs.</li>
<li> I cold wax my eyebrows.</li>
<li> ..use your hands to cup cold water and rinse off all the product don&#x27;t leave any on your skin..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Moom - I&#x27;ve been using Moom for about 6 months now. It&#x27;s easy to use and I have a few tips.&lt;br /&gt;- Putting a thicker layer of wax helps when you take the strip off&lt;br /&gt;- Only heat it for about 15 seconds, stir it and give it a chance to cool off&lt;br /&gt;- Cut the larger strips if you are doing smaller areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product quite simply did not work for me. I have relatively thin but dark hair, and I have a huge problem getting any waxes or similar products to actually stick to my hair well enough to pull it out. I followed the directions and put a bit of baby powder on the area and it still pulled out maybe half of the hair after many applications and I had to shave the rest. I was very disappointed as most people seem to swear by this but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I was not very impressed with this product. I love the lavender one, for whatever reason, I feel that it works better. The rose wasn&#x27;t as good, but I can&#x27;t specify why, it just didn&#x27;t seem as effective.</li>
    <li> Now one of the nasty part of growing older is the ability to grow hair in places that never were a problem before.  Think of your grandma.  So, I thought what the heck I&#x27;ll try this stuff.  Well it is certainly sticky.  The problem was that the hair did not go with the sticky.  Hey, if you like  being sugared this is the stuff for you.</li>
    <li> It dont work any better then what I made myself, but it does work and it smells nice</li>
    <li> I like it. More importantly, my daughter likes it. She/we decided to forgo shaving and dive into sugaring instead. The result? Nice smooth legs for her and the residue washes right off in the shower. And weeks before needing to do it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it about five times since I bought. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin at all, even when you wax the same spot twice. However, it doesn&#x27;t always get all the facial hair but in part I blame myself for I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;mj using it correctly. Other than that, great product. Didn&#x27;t give it give stars because it doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair. And you have to make sure your face is absolutely dry, with no oils or it will definitely not work. I loved the fact that is dissolves with water, no more sticky mess.</li>
    <li> Love this wax! I use it for my bikini area and it barely hurts compared to other products! love it and i will continue to use this product that fell from the heavens.</li>
    <li> Good item for the price i am very satisfied with the quality of the product.  Very good deal for the money.</li>
    <li> The first real wax product I could actually use myself and see the results.  I use this on my arms and do it just as it says and you will get great results too.  Mine lasts a good month.</li>
    <li> It took a few times to master maxing with this product. I&#x27;m happy with the product, however, it ran out prett fast. I only did my legs, bikini, and arms.</li>
    <li> I have tried this on my bikini line and on my eyebrows. Sometimes it works on my eyebrows if it is cold in the house. Didn&#x27;t work at all on my bikini line. Left all the hair behind. I like the gigi hard wax or cirepil soft wax much better. This wax is way overpriced for what it does, or should I say doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> Sooo easy to use....Best if used with wax warmer....  washes off with water.... already purchased more!!</li>
    <li> I like this and if I could get better at using it, I would probably give it 5 stars. I cannot figure it out. I also think they should give more strips for the amount of product.</li>
    <li> Oh, yay, a hair removal product that actually works! I recommend, as many reviewers have stated, heat this product as stated. Using this product without heating to thee recommended temperature causes a mess. Yes, this product will clean-up with water. Yet, heating it will produce optimal results.</li>
    <li> I bought this at ross and love the hell out of it, when I ran out I just had to have it again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great seller</li>
    <li> I like this product but I just have a low tolerance for pain so it wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> Extremely please with this product and the seller.</li>
    <li> This product is basically made with sugar water. It&#x27;s very effective and if anything is left behind, it could easily be dissolved with water, not with synthetic solutions.</li>
    <li> I cold wax my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve also used this on my bikini line (also cold) and it works really well. My only complaint, is that it&#x27;s a little funky smelling, but I&#x27;ll get an unscented one next time.</li>
    <li> I am really satisfied with this product. First of all because it doesnt hurt or irritate my skin, and second of all because it smells amazing. It got here on time and it was definately worth the price.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what is says. I had a pain free experience with the product, and it&#x27;s quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s not the problem I have. After using the product, I got red bumps that lasted for 2 days. Then, just 11 days after using it, I got red bumps again when some of the hairs start to reappear. Note, not all of them are reappearing yet. And, once they all have reappeared, I have to wait for them to get to 1/4\\&quot; to use the product again. I estimate that will take about 2 weeks, since human hair usually grows 1/2\\&quot; per month. So, best case scenario, I can sugar wax with this every 25 days, but of those 25 days only 9 days would I be without hair or red bumps. Note that this scenario is probably not different than it would be for waxing, and I would prefer this to waxing if it was the only other option, but I don&#x27;t think I\\&quot;ll be using this again.</li>
    <li> I use MOOM on my face.  It does not rip your skin off or leave it irritated.  In fact, it leaves your skin soft and smooth.  And, if a bit of hair remains you can reuse the fabric strip with the wax on it that you just pulled off ... just press it back on and let her rip.  Have used both the original and the Rose Essence and don&#x27;t notice a difference between the two.  The Rose Essence smells good, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to matter since you wash it right off.  My skin had the same soft and smooth feel after both.  Just warm your jar in the microwave for a few seconds and spread it on thinly.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t buy it on Amazon, but gave it a try. My gal moved that did my threading and waxing and needed to try something. I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried other wax kits in the past and they didn&#x27;t work. Followed the directions except for the microwave time (base it on how you know your microwave functions). Did my waxing and I was impressed! It did the job, yes I did have to go over again in a few areas (I&#x27;m very hairy with DEEP roots), but that&#x27;s normal with any wax. My skin was left smooth and soft and the hair gone. It lasted 3 weeks and I&#x27;ll have to do it again. But worth every penny and safer than having a salon wax you. Actually it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as other waxes I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This sugar paste worked very very nicely. The hair was gone and my skin was silky smooth. However, I used the whole jar, and it was barely enough to do both my legs, from knees to toes. maybe i just didn&#x27;t do it right, I don&#x27;t know, it was my first time</li>
    <li> good wax...doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin</li>
    <li> Removing the wax off your slin has never been so easy. Because its simply sugar and other natural soothing ingredients, it rinses right off and doesnt leave any sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! You don&#x27;t have to heat it and it&#x27;s not messy!!</li>
    <li> Works great and rinses quickly and easily with just water. I will not use any other hair remover product.  Btw...I don&#x27;t work for Moom and I wasn&#x27;t paid to review this product :-)</li>
    <li> This product is so easy to use, and very effective.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and wouldn&#x27;t consider any other product.</li>
    <li> It last for one month only</li>
    <li> This wax smells nice and is definitely high quality. However, it irritated my skin and I had red bumps for a week despite it being for sensitive skin. My skin is very sensitive, so I guess that is not much of a surprise. Unfortunately, it also didn&#x27;t pull out all the hairs. I think the problem is not so much the wax but that I can&#x27;t get down the technique to do it properly.</li>
    <li> Make sure you read the instructions.  I waxed my upper lip and chin.  Did OK for my first time, I usually get this done at my hair salon, but the prices are going up and up plus the tip.  The product worked just like it said..I was nervous at first, but everything is OK..use your hands to cup cold water and rinse off all the product don&#x27;t leave any on your skin..I would highly recommend using an ice bag on the area for at least 1 hour off and on to minimize redness.</li>
    <li> I love how gentle this product is and doesn&#x27;t cause me any type of irritation after using, but mainly it gets rid of the hair. If you live in a cold area, all you need to do is heat it in microwave for 5-10sec and you are ready to use. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was my first time using any kind of product like this (wax, sugar, etc).  I read the instructions and went for it.  It was easy!  It didn&#x27;t hurt (just felt like a band-aid coming off).  It was easy to clean up.  I would recommend reheating it after the first leg (if doing legs) or 20 min of use because it&#x27;s harder to apply and stickier when it&#x27;s cooled off.  Highly recommended &amp; will definitely use again.</li>
