<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I personally preferred the Gel over the Lotion. But this is not too bad. But after this, I think I will still go back to the gel, as it gives you better slide if you do deep work. The owner/company was not as bright, and could not find my shipping address (which I have never have such problem before). After a few phone calls back and forth, I was just keeping my fingercrossed and hope it arrives to my door step.</li>
    <li> This massage lotion is always easy to work with on all my clients.</li>
    <li> Great lotion spreads well and isn&#x27;t oily but lubricates skin nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Biotone, what&#x27;s not to like? It gives enough glide and enough grip. It doesn&#x27;t leave your clients greasy and it&#x27;s great for your sensitive skin clients. Also there is really no smell so it doesn&#x27;t distract from your massage or mess with your essential oils when doing aromatherapy. I use it as a carrier in my aromatherapy massages and it works great.</li>
    <li> I was buying an expensive lotion that required about twice as much lotion per massage.  The Biotone Advanced Therapy has just the right amount of slip and lasts longer than other lotions.  The price was great in the gallon jug too.  The pump is a must buy too.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This lotion gives the glide you need for deep work without the friction or leaving a heavy oily feel on skin. It also absorbs easily to the skin of clients that may be dehydrated leaving their skin moisturized. It washes from sheets easily and also has no loud scent for those sensitive to smell and when using your own Aromatherapy added to it.</li>
    <li> Hands down one of the best massage lotions on the market.  The gallon is great if you like to mix with essential oils or have alot of clients.  Make sure you buy the gallon pump with it!!</li>
    <li> My clients and my absolute favorite massage lotion. Quality, perfect long-lasting glide, non-sticky, non-greasy. Absolutely worth every penny. Also great base for blending in essential oils as well.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this stuff for her massage clients for years.  She and the clients love it.  I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> This is silky and creamy - I add it to my regular lotion and it allows me to massage the cream in for a longer time.</li>
    <li> This does a great job.  It is easy to use and not very oily and it has a very low scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years on clients because it doesn&#x27;t require a lot to create a good glide and it absorbs into the skin much better than massage cremes and oils. I hate getting a massage and feeling slick and oily afterward; I imagine my clients wouldn&#x27;t want that either. It has no scent which is a very practical feature in a medical setting that concentrates on the therapeutic aspect of massage rather than some of the more spa-like aspects(i.e. aromatherapy, facials, wraps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had one client tell me she couldn&#x27;t have a massage because she thought she&#x27;d be allergic to anything I used (she&#x27;s allergic to almost everything), but when I let her read the ingredients of Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion she was surprised to see no red flags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another client of mine, an elderly woman with several health problems arrived for her first appointment telling me I would have to use *her* lotion that she brought because her skin was too delicate for anything else. She pulled an 8oz bottle of-yep- Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion, and I was delighted to tell her she wouldn&#x27;t have to dip into her own supply because I already use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to any massage therapist. It&#x27;s excellently made and surprisingly inexpensive for its quality.</li>
    <li> I am a massage therapist and this was less expensive than going through Massage Warehouse. Biotone has been amongst my top three lotions to use. The consistency is perfect. It allows for a nice and smooth glide while having some thickness for friction. This lotion also allows for a non-residue for the body and fabric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the nature of my profession we encounter many people with allergies. I have found Biotone to be enjoyed by many who have allergies.</li>
    <li> Its the only brand I use in my massage therapy practice. The unscented formula is perfect for those with sensitivities and perfect for those who like aroma therapy. Blends well with essential oils. Washes out of my sheets!!  UPDATE: JUST MAKE SURE ITS NOT RANCID! This last shipment was spoiled, rancid disgusting smelling, chunky, clumpy. THIS IS NOT THE NORMAL PRODUCT</li>
    <li> My local massage supply store stopped carrying Biotone Advanced Therapy and I was forced to try several different brands while I waited for my shipment to arrive.  I was unimpressed with all the others and one of my clients even noticed the difference as soon as I applied the other brand!    I can&#x27;t say enough about this lotion.  It has the best glide-ability without being too runny or too thick and doesn&#x27;t leave my clients feeling coated with oil as some other brands do.  It can be used for deep tissue or trigger point if applied sparingly and never makes me feel like I&#x27;m slipping as long as I don&#x27;t apply too much.      With all my years of experience and different lotion trials, I&#x27;ve come to use only Biotone Advanced Therapy.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!! I love biotone just can&#x27;t always find it.</li>
    <li> This lotion became moldy and rancid after three months. I actually lost a client because of it. I had kept it in a cool unheated room in our office. I have used Biotone Advanced Therapy lotion for ten years and never experienced a problem with shelf life. I spoke with a CS agent at Biotone and gave him the batch code. He confirmed that it had an 18-month shelf life. Since I had purchased it from Bodywork Mall on Amazon the Biotone agent was unable to help me. He told me to speak with Bodywork Mall directly and assured me that they would help with a replacement. When I called Bodywork Mall the woman I spoke with said that since it was past their return period there was nothing they could do. I pointed out that the lotion didn&#x27;t go bad until after the return period! She put me on hold while she consulted her supervisor. She then told me that they would confirm my conversation with the Biotone agent and promised that she would get back to me and resolve the issue. She never did. I will never purchase from this company again.</li>
    <li> Great product .. Not greasy .. Great product for Swedish to deep tissue massage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for nearly twenty years in my massage practice and I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 2 years and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;It gives enough gliding but not so slippery and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Also my clients like the softness left on their skin after the treatment.</li>
    <li> I use this massage lotion in my everyday practice. it&#x27;s very good for general massage and deep tissue work. The only thing I hate about this particular product is bottle. It becomes to narrow and makes it hard to get that last bit of product out. I have to heat the bottle up to make it almost a liquid to pour out. The inside product however is pretty good. I have only used one other lotion I like better, and it&#x27;s by the same company.</li>
    <li> I have been a therapist for almost 8 years and of all the lotions I have used, this is my favorite. It spreads well and doesn&#x27;t require a ton of reapplication. Super mild. I have never had any complaints or reactions from my clients. I get asked all the time what I use because people love the feel of it. Not greasy at all. I live in Florida, and a bottle I left in my cupholder overflowed from the heat (oops!). All that was left was a tiny bit of oil in the bottom of the cupholder. Love that is mostly water. Doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets ever. Great lotion!</li>
    <li> I use this Biotone lotion for Massage. I like the consistency, it gives me the right amount of&lt;br /&gt;glide without slip.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have to reapply unless the skin is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Biotone Gel which also works very well especially if someone has body hair!&lt;br /&gt;Have tried Samples of other products from different companies but have never enjoyed working&lt;br /&gt;with them!&lt;br /&gt;A Very Satisfied Customer :)</li>
    <li> Nice glide, not greasy. Can add essential oils if you want a scent- but I find several of my clients like the no-scent option if they are going out somewhere after they leave me and don&#x27;t want to smell like a spa :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 14 years. No greasy residue and it doesn&#x27;t ruin my sheets or clothes like massage oil.</li>
    <li> Loved it! Great product! Will buy again. Had great glide and slip to it and washed out of my sheet!</li>
    <li> Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion is my favorite lotion to work with, it has nice glide, very moisturizing without leaving a greasy/oily feeling.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better than the oils. It lasts for a long time. I really recommend it. Customers love it too.</li>
    <li> I have used this product since 2005. I&#x27;ve never found anything that comes close to it. It lubricates well without the oiliness.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biotone products for my bodywork sessions for years and I&#x27;m still completely satisfied with its performance. It has just the right balance of moisture I need to do my work effectively and not have my clients leave my office at all feeling greasy. I also use half as much as any of the best natural lotions I can buy from my local health food store. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone, especially other therapists, looking for a lotion that performs well and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great lotion for massage been using for  over a year no issues.</li>
    <li> Much neater than oil but doesn&#x27;t evaporate like regular lotions. Perfect amount of glide and grip for all massage techniques.</li>
    <li> The product is good &amp; the delivery was on time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quiet some time now, and I love it and so do my clients</li>
    <li> This is a great product and arrives very quickly after delivery. I&#x27;ve ordered several of these over the last year via Amazon Prime and I have been happy with every purchase thus far. This massage lotion has just the right amount of glide professionals expect and the fact that it is hypoallergenic and unscented is an added value for anyone receiving a massage or bodywork.</li>
    <li> I have used Biotone Lotion for a long time and think it is the best product and worth the price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it works great because it last a long time while messaging. It&#x27;s not greasy and lasts at least twice as long as any other message product I&#x27;ve used. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with product and quick delivery</li>
    <li> BIOTONE advancef therapy lotion. Perfect glide for palpating dysfunctional tissue! I work with professional athletes who take their therapy as serious as their training! Using the best products in the industry is a must! Biotone advanced therapy lotion is the best on the market!</li>
    <li> it feels like oil going on...but your skin drinks it up and leaves no oily finish.  I like the viscosity</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by an associate and it lived up to expectations ! It was at an excellent price and I was impressed by the non greasy oily formulation !</li>
    <li> The best massage lotion I have and will ever use.</li>
    <li> This is my go to Massage Lotion. I have tried many many others, but I always come back to the Biotone Advanced Therapy.&lt;br /&gt;It is unscented,hypoallergenic and paraben free. Many of my clients are very health concious and careful about what they put on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;It is also nut oil and mineral oil free.&lt;br /&gt;It has the perfect glide for many different styles of massage.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a bit longer than other lotions, so you don&#x27;t have to constantly pump,pump,pump...&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the very best price including shipping for this product, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006PQ6DY?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for along time , it&#x27;s a great product</li>
    <li> some one refereed me to try Biotone Lotion, i really like the quality on the products, non greasy, smooth glides, no rancid smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a massage therapist for 20 years and have used a lot of different products.  At the moment, this is my favorite for general massage.  Enough glide without being slippery and virtually scentless so no complaints from my clients.  I plan to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than my usual lotion, but it&#x27;s so pliable you save money by using so much less in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been and Massage Therapist for 20 years.  I have NEVER used anything else but Biotone.  I&#x27;ve never had a client have an allergic reaction, plus they prefer the scent free formula. They also love the feel afterwards (smooth and silky),  not greasy.  It&#x27;s pricey, but I do think it&#x27;s well worth it.  This lotion is so thick that I have to nuke it for two minutes, to be able to pour the lotion into my bottles.</li>
    <li> Just received the biotone lotion and I think I am going to like it. I am used to Biotone creme but wanted something less oily feeling after application. I use it for deep tissue massage and it provides just enough glide without drying out too quickly like other lotions.</li>
    <li> i do physical therapy and found this lotion for the massage to my client, wow it works just perfect, i highly recommended. i just order this every time i run out of it.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, I was using expensive oils for my massages this is defiantly the to, seller wascurtious and fast delivery, I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion i have used thus far.  My clients love it and are never allergic to it.  My skin loves it and i have the softest elbows in the world.</li>
    <li> I been using Biotone Advanced therapy for almost 2 years and i really liked and my clients liked too.</li>
    <li> Live this lotion for massages, I&#x27;ve tried lots of different brands but nothing compares, I&#x27;ve used it for about 10 years now.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It has a light touch smooth application and rubs in with no risidual film remaining on my clients skin to get all over my sheets or their clothes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for quite a while now. I have to say, it does not go as far as I was led to believe. I cannot use it at all in a traditional Swedish Massage. It takes constant applications of the lotion to keep clients hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I am able to do decent deep work with the lotion, but to have one lotion that could do light relaxation and deep work was the original idea here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is actually easier and more cost effective to use regular lotion and crème in tandem rather than have this combined product. Most people don&#x27;t want only deep work and this dries and gets sticky almost every couple minutes. Its cheaper just to use the lotion and apply crème as needed. You will use this product way to fast due to multiple reapplications.</li>
    <li> I have&#x27;nt tried to many massage lotions but, this one is truelly incredible. If they get better I don&#x27;t know what to say. What a wonderful product, I rubbed my wife all night and it kept going along with me with little to no reaplication.She also went to bed without showering and the next morning her skin was silky smooth to the touch and no stains were left on the sheets from the lotion. It was almost as if the lotion atracted other moisture to it and alowed my hands to slide on it . I have used oils and other regular lotions and they pale in comparison. I highly recomend this product to any proffesional masseuse or husband that loves to dote on his wife.</li>
    <li> Not greasy, good glide, no real smell, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
    <li> I use Biotone Advanced because it last longer than regular lotion to do massage. The price is also good too.</li>
    <li> this lotion is good.  it lowers the co-efficient of friction as it should.  it doesnt end up too greasy.  If you need lotion, consider this product.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time in my profession not to thick or to thin. Good glide. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Purchased this on the recommendation of my Massotherapist to get a lotion not an oil for home massages. I was surprised how this moisturizes without greasiness. Almost no smell as well.</li>
    <li> The best lotion I&#x27;ve found, it really goes a long way especially for those hairy clients! Don&#x27;t forget to give it a short zap in the microwave to get every last drop!</li>
    <li> After using some other massage lotion and oils on clients, I can definitely say that this lotion is hands down my favorite to use so far. It has no smell, is very smooth, and lends itself to a lot of strokes when massaging. The price is well worth it as well. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> We have a portable massage table at home and my husband and I enjoy trading massages. There is no place to purchase massage lotion in my rural town; the nearest place is 90 miles away. I thought it was rather expensive, but I&#x27;m not sure because I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. It was the least expensive in my web search and it works really good (doesn&#x27;t absorb too quickly so the massage is a continual glide,) but I wish it had a scent, lavendar or lilac or something soothing. Other than that it serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> This is the usual good stuff that BIOTONE provides..however, be advised that this blend has an initial cooling effect when first applied..even after warming in your hands first. Men tend to like this...Women..not so much..and 95% of my clients are Women. I am ordering something else and giving this to the female CMT&#x27;s I work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Markkus</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for the last 20 years as a massage therapist.  I highly recommend it for deep tissue work.  It gives the perfect amount of glide and resistance.</li>
    <li> I have used it for several years in my massage practice and it works so well I never considered switching.</li>
    <li> This is the best massage lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> It works great for pressure points and deep tissue massaging.  Don&#x27;t have to consistently add more. Glide is perfect for working on sore muscles.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I got my license. No essence, great glide, no grease so does not stain your sheets.</li>
    <li> always my favorite I keep on stock.</li>
    <li> This product is great for both Deep Tissue and Swedish (and anywhere in between). I bought a half gallon before to test it out and then went for the whole gallon. It is reasonably priced and great for mixing essential oils in because it has absolutely no sent before hand. Hypoallergenic for sensitive clients.</li>
    <li> Good lotion.  No smell and great for massaging.</li>
    <li> I always only buy biotone for giving massages. I like this one for my pump I wear with the belt, but, I prefer the cream one more because its not as slippery. I like to give slower massages. I have to concentrate a little more with this, so I don&#x27;t move so fast. otherwise...great product.</li>
    <li> used this for 16 years</li>
    <li> I love this massage lotion, it has a nice glide and you don&#x27;t need much to get the job done. It doesn&#x27;t leave your clients oily and its not messy at all. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Super smooth and nice warmed up first.</li>
    <li> First, they are not listing all the ingredients. The ingredients as listed on my bottle (parenthetical descriptions omitted): Water, Octyl Palmitate, Blend of Apricot Oil, Sesame oil, and grapeseed oil, canola oil, emulsifying wax NF, glycerin, grapeseed extract, carbomer, germal, dimethicone, TEA, iodopropynyl butylcarbomate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use this, it makes me itch like crazy, and I&#x27;m not the only one.  In discussing the merits of lubricants with another massage therapist, I discovered she had the same issue with this product.  It might provide a smooth glide, but it&#x27;s not worth it.  There are other, better products out there that provide the same smooth glide and consistency.  I will never use this product line again, and I want to warn everyone I can about it&#x27;s side effects.  After all, if you use a product on a client that makes them itch, or feel bad in any way, they won&#x27;t be a repeat client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good rule to follow, test new products on yourself first, several times, and wait to see if your skin reacts to it before using it on clients.  Just a suggestion.</li>
    <li> We love that it is Hypoallergenic so We can basically use it on any client, But you have to use so much of it in one massage because it gets absorbed so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Good stuff, clients like it&lt;br /&gt;I do hospice massage on very fragile skin!!!&lt;br /&gt;This fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will reorder too.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a gift for a Massage Therapist just starting out in this business field. Reports are that the clients and the MT are very satisfied with the product and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I got this for my BF for Xmas as he is in massage school.  This was a great purchase.  Good price and good massage lotion.  He is getting a lot of use out of it and will probably run through it pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> If you go through a lot of Biotone, this is a reasonable way to buy it. Make sure you get the pump so you can fill your smaller bottles with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product but neglected to be a pump...not sure it&#x27;s even sold here. It&#x27;s a real pain trying to get the lotion into another smaller Biotone bottle. Seriously, they should require that you buy the dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good massage lotion...no scent, but it&#x27;s a little thick to pour and is best heated up a bit. I usually put the bottle in front of a space heater before use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an LMT since 2005, and this is by far my favorite massage lotion. I get compliments from nearly every client on how wonderful it feels and it truly has superior glide without being greasy.</li>
    <li> It came quickly in the mail. Also you barely need any at all. I have been using it almost daily on my clients and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and product as described</li>
    <li> I researched and purchased this lotion about 8 months ago to take along to my chiropractor and massage therapist treatments; both continue to comment on how much they like working with my lotion.  I love this stuff - it doesn&#x27;t smell (I have one of the most sensitive sniffers on the planet), it lasts well during a 60-minute massage, and when used as a moisturizing lotion it absorbs easily.  It is also non-staining.  My chiropractor got some on my slacks once and it washed-out completely.  I see a few massagers complain that they need to use too much, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me whatsoever.  I&#x27;ve had five months worth of weekly visits to chiropractor and/or massage therapist and still have more than an ounce  left in my 8-oz bottle.  I&#x27;m ordering the gallon now, so I can moisturize and still have plenty left for therapy appointments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to refill my 8 oz bottle from the new gallon, we used a One Quart Zip-Loc bag; cut one of the bottom corners, and, like a frosting bag, squeezed the lotion into the small bottle.  Worked great, no mess, no clean up.</li>
    <li> I bought oil too, but only use this. I use this on my clients. The glide is like oil, but without the mess. Some clients have skin that absorbs very quickly, so more lotion needs to be used on them...</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my massage therapist it is a great product.  Our patients love it because it doesn&#x27;t make them feel greasy after a massage and the smell is limited.  All my staff use it as a hand lotion for dry hands because it does a great job in adding moisture to the skin with out the normal greasy residue you get in many lotions.</li>
    <li> This is a great lotion for all modalities. It penetrates the skin while having a nice Swedish glide upfront.&lt;br /&gt;The  unscented can be combined with any essential oil for an aromatherapy massage. Great product for busy therapists!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions for the buck. i would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Works great, not too thick, or thin.</li>
    <li> As a massage therapist I find this lotion versatile and have been able to use this with clients who have sensitive skin with no problems.  A great addition to my practice.</li>
    <li> Our massage therapist swears by it&lt;br /&gt;and our patients love it . One of the most important things about this product ifor our Chiropractic office is that it leaves very little almost no residue on the patient</li>
    <li> Love it. Not greasy, does soak in fairly quickly but I need the moisturization so I love it. Great price.</li>
    <li> Perfect for giving therapeutic massage.  Have used it for years and will continue to!  Perfect glide and clients love the feel Asti is not greasy and messy.</li>
    <li> This is for personal use, I am not a massage therapist. This is the best massage lotion I have used so far.  It does not really have any scent.  It glides over the skin easily without being greasy and lasts a reasonable amount of time for a massage lotion.</li>
    <li> ...all went well . Fast,fast,fast. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Good deal on a very good brand!</li>
    <li> I have experienced the beneficial qualities of Biotone Advanced Therapy Massage Lotion for many years as many of the different professional body workers and licensed massage therapists (LMTs) I have received massage from have used Biotone - I have witnessed Biotone is often the choice of professionals I have met in my travels around the country. Biotone Advanced Therapy is such a high quality lotion that I buy it by the gallon to refill our standard lotion dispensers [[ASIN:B001CD4FT6 Better Living Products Clear Choice Dispenser Three Chamber Shower Dispenser, White]] at home for routine lotion use as well as self-massage of some trouble areas. Since this massage lotion is UNSCENTED, I usually blend in a couple drops of a quality essential oil in my favorite scents - either jasmine or patchouli or citrus or lavender and eucalyptus depending on my mood. Note:  I never mix into the full jug, I always pour some into a smaller container to blend the scents so the full jug can remain \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; and ready for a different scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  water, octyl palmitate (coconut oil ester), blend of apricot oil (prunus armeniaca), sesame oil (sesamum indicum), and grapeseed oil (vitis vinifera), canola oil (brassica napus), emulsifying wax NF (vegetable derived), glycerin (vegetable derived), grapeseed extract (vitis vinifera), carbomer, germal, gimethicone, TEA, Iodopropynyl butylcarbamate. Paraben Free and Cruelty Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotone Advanced Therapy is FREE of artificial dyes and colors, such as the petrochemical sourced FD&amp;C Blue 1 to which many people experience adverse reactions.  I highly recommend Biotone Advanced Therapy for both the professional masseuse as well as the amateur providing massage to their partner.</li>
    <li> Great price, massage therapists love to use at my office</li>
    <li> used this product for years...massage.  the only thing i use.</li>
