      <li>I love this, everyone that I come into contact with, ask what I&#x27;m wearing becuase</li>
      <li>I get more complements on this than any fragrance I wear.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this scent.  </li>
      <li>I bought this perfume as a gift for my mom who has worn Insolence for many years</li>
      <li>Underrated for price, lovely , not my ffavourite.</li>
      <li>but this one is something I can&#x27;t ignore and would love to have.</li>
      <li>I am so glad to have found it.</li>
      <li>My favorite fragrance of all time is Insolence, this one is My Insolence.</li>
      <li>So many people gave me compliments.,</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been out and about and</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t take long to receive this product and the smell is awesome!  </li>
      <li>the scent was fine, but I didn&#x27;t want the My Insolence, I wanted the Insolence.  </li>
      <li>Love the mild fruity scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s both sexy and alluring and worth the price being asked.</li>
      <li>An innocent yet grown up fragrance that is both fresh and sultry.  </li>
      <li>Light but stays with you.</li>
      <li>Not too strong for my pregnant nose.</li>
      <li>I first tried this fragrance 2 years ago when my husband got it as a Christmas gift and since then it&#x27;s been one of my favorite.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to any women out there that love a wonderful perfume that packs a &amp;#34;pow,&amp;#34; without going overboard and being to strong.  </li>
      <li>This is a more realistic price for cologne.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>It has a fun fruity smell and it&#x27;s not too overpowering or too fruity.</li>
      <li>Totally worth it.</li>
      <li>It is a very nice smelling everyday scent.</li>
      <li>someone&#x27;s said, \\&quot;I love that perfume you&#x27;re wearing--what is it?\\&quot;  Scents are hard because not only does it have to smell nice, but it has to smell nice with your pheromones (which you can&#x27;t smell--impossible much?).  </li>
      <li>I first found this perfume from my mother.  </li>
      <li>It is sweet but warm and is a touch heavy ….perfect</li>
      <li>/&gt;This&#x27;ll be my third bottle, and they better warn me if they ever decide to discontinue it so I can buy my lifetime supply.</li>
      <li>any good perfume,  it smells different on different women.</li>
      <li>The bottle looks exactly the same as the original scent.</li>
      <li>This was just what I ordered,the reviews were very helpfull.</li>
      <li>I have paid as much as $58.70 for it.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Chanel #5, not so much.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>In a world where many women&#x27;s fragrances run from tart, to musk, to some that frankly present the fragrance of Raid, I picked this for my wife because of it&#x27;s light, fresh, open, flowery, feminine scent that lingers and above all, complements my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;chemistry&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I highly recomend it.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately they don&#x27;t carry this perfume anymore, so thanks to Amazon, I was able to get it!  </li>
      <li>She wears it very well and receives compliments on it regularly.</li>
      <li>I have to agree with all the other reviews that I am not even aware I am wearing it</li>

<li> This fragrance is not easy to find in the stores.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve solely worn my insolence for the past 3 years.</li>
<li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so I buy it when I see it.</li>
<li> I Have a hard time finding it in stores anymore.</li>
<li> for the cold months.</li>
<li> This fragrance isn&#x27;t bad</li>
<li> I have never had to return anything from Amazon and am disappointed in this product.</li>
<li> In my opinion it is terrible!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I first tried this fragrance 2 years ago when my husband got it as a Christmas gift and since then it&#x27;s been one of my favorite. The scent lasts all day without having to be reapplied. It has a fun fruity smell and it&#x27;s not too overpowering or too fruity. It&#x27;s both sexy and alluring and worth the price being asked. Everyone&#x27;s body adjust differently to differnt fragrances so although it may be perfect for me it may not be for you. I&#x27;d suggest trying it out at your local perfume shop before getting. Leave it on for a few hours, go ahead and shop and then come back before buying.</li>
    <li> The best fragrance. I&#x27;ve solely worn my insolence for the past 3 years. I always get complimented even after a long day and no need to touch up. My husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I have paid as much as $58.70 for it.I love this fragrance. It&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve worn for years and I use to only find it in upper scale department stores for a hefty price. I&#x27;m glad Amazon.com is selling it now.  Will buy again</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this scent.  I have to agree with all the other reviews that I am not even aware I am wearing it and I have people constantly complimenting me.  I had someone say that they wanted to stand beside me all day because they loved the scent.  This is my signature scent.  I hope they never discontinue making this or I will be lost.</li>
    <li> the scent was fine, but I didn&#x27;t want the My Insolence, I wanted the Insolence.  However I was not allow to return or exchange this item so now I have a 69.00 bottle of perfume decorating my vanity!!</li>
    <li> This fragrance is not easy to find in the stores.  I was happy to see that Amazon made it available.  It is sweet but warm and is a touch heavy ….perfect for the cold months. I love how it remains on my clothing after I have used it.  Not many fragrances last as well as this one. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I get more complements on this than any fragrance I wear. From friends and total strangers,  male and female.  The Raspberry note is discernable but its still not too rruity.  An innocent yet grown up fragrance that is both fresh and sultry.  Light but stays with you.</li>
    <li> This was just what I ordered,the reviews were very helpfull. I would recommend this product to every one. In the past I ordered insolence but it was not the same as my insolence. I am so glad to have found it.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this perfume!! Highly recommend this to any women out there that love a wonderful perfume that packs a &amp;#34;pow,&amp;#34; without going overboard and being to strong.  And my husband loves it too!  I first found this perfume from my mother.  She received this as a gift from my dad.  He had purchased it at Macy&#x27;s back in 2007. Unfortunately they don&#x27;t carry this perfume anymore, so thanks to Amazon, I was able to get it!  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> Yummy floral.  I get tons, and tons of compliments when I were this perfume!</li>
    <li> How does one describe a fragrance? In a world where many women&#x27;s fragrances run from tart, to musk, to some that frankly present the fragrance of Raid, I picked this for my wife because of it&#x27;s light, fresh, open, flowery, feminine scent that lingers and above all, complements my wife&#x27;s &amp;#34;chemistry&amp;#34;. She wears it very well and receives compliments on it regularly. It&#x27;s a regular birthday present from me. Larger bottle lasts about a year. Then again, I like White Shoulders as well. Chanel #5, not so much.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I&#x27;ve been out and about and someone&#x27;s said, \\&quot;I love that perfume you&#x27;re wearing--what is it?\\&quot;  Scents are hard because not only does it have to smell nice, but it has to smell nice with your pheromones (which you can&#x27;t smell--impossible much?).  It&#x27;s going to be a bit different for everyone.  That being said, this is such a smart, light, fruity, almost mischievous perfume that will complement a ton of people&#x27;s base scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This&#x27;ll be my third bottle, and they better warn me if they ever decide to discontinue it so I can buy my lifetime supply.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume.  So many people gave me compliments.,</li>
    <li> Love the mild fruity scent. Been using it and I tried other perfume but this one is something I can&#x27;t ignore and would love to have. Hope My Insolence will stay forever.</li>
    <li> Underrated for price, lovely , not my ffavourite. Smells very nice though.</li>
    <li> Great value! Speedy shipping!</li>
    <li> I love this, everyone that I come into contact with, ask what I&#x27;m wearing becuase I smell so good!My Insolence last for a long time too. I put it on, I don&#x27;t even smell it anymore, but others do and love the way it makes them feel, to smell this wonderful perfume! I will wear this for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I hope they will continue making it. I Have a hard time finding it in stores anymore. Please Please tell Guerlain to keep making it!</li>
    <li> Received item on time....pleased with my purchase. No problems</li>
    <li> I absolutely love My Insolence! Didn&#x27;t take long to receive this product and the smell is awesome!  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Product was perfect. Fast delivery. Excellent service. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and light and fruity. Not too strong for my pregnant nose. But I bought the wrong one I thought this was the original insolence. I&#x27;m still keeping it. It&#x27;s a nice nice summer spring scent.</li>
    <li> And people always ask me, \\&quot;what smells so good in here?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not joking when I answer, \\&quot;me.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any good perfume,  it smells different on different women. I&#x27;ve even complimented women who are wearing the same without even knowing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find, so I buy it when I see it. Totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume as a gift for my mom who has worn Insolence for many years but I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. This perfume is not Insolence by Guerlain. I&#x27;m not sure if the name My Insolence represents something different from Insolence but the smell is completely different. In my opinion it is terrible! The bottle looks exactly the same as the original scent. If this was supposed to be another product wouldn&#x27;t they have changed the appearance? I have never had to return anything from Amazon and am disappointed in this product. Not only is it not what I expected but after spending $71 I&#x27;m unable to return it and get something I do want.</li>
    <li> It is the fragrance that I love and the price of it retail is out of sight. This is a more realistic price for cologne.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. One of her favorites. I highly recomend it. It is a very nice smelling everyday scent.</li>
    <li> This fragrance isn&#x27;t bad but I ordered it by mistake. My favorite fragrance of all time is Insolence, this one is My Insolence. Similar but not the same.</li>
</ol>
