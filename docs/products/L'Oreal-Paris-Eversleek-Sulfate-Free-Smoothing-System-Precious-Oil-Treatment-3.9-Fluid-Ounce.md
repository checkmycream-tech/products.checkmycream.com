      <li>This is the best hair oil which i used.</li>
      <li>It makes your hair look silky and beautiful!  </li>
      <li>However,  it is the best oil that I have found for my purposes.  </li>
      <li>An excellent buy and must-have for unruly, curly hair.</li>
      <li>An excellent addition to thermal protection before using the Blowdryer.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS!!!</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Argan Oil is a great product.  </li>
      <li>It works and smells great</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair with great texture.</li>
      <li>It smells great and feels sleek, as they say it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see myself not using this product I love it!!</li>
      <li>Not as delicious smelling as morrocan oil, but way cheaper and works maybe even a bit better.  </li>
      <li>Good product for the $.</li>
      <li>Best product I have found to smooth out my frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>Good product for hair</li>
      <li>But this is a great substitute if you are on a budget, or rather save the money and buy some more hair products to try.</li>
      <li>&quot;  twould be to find  that Santa deposited a year&#x27;s supply  of Loreal Ever Sleek precious oil treatment in my stocking at Christmas:-) !!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>, It&#x27;s a 10, Aargan Oil, Fredrick Fekkai and way more!</li>
      <li>What a fabulous, refined, oil!!</li>
      <li>I love this !</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
      <li>For $10, you can achieve amazing looking hair temporarily.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s precious Argan Oil -- isn&#x27;t a detangler nor much of a conditioner, but what it does do brilliantly is add shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We will use the product up, but I have already replaced the Moroccan Oil and we are using that most days again.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I just wasn&#x27;t so in love with the price and figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper option.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for a good oil for my hair, and this is definitely the product I am happy</li>
      <li>We all love Morrocanoil.</li>
      <li>idea of \\&quot; striking it rich\\</li>
      <li>It is elegant &amp; silky :</li>
      <li>(makes more manageable)</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I use it on damp hair and also on dry hair; works great!</li>
      <li>As a whole , pleasant</li>
      <li>What I love about it, though, is that it is a very effective detangler for my curly hair and leaves my hair wonderfully soft.</li>
      <li>but Loreal makes good products and is reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>Love this oil - smells good, makes my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I bought because I kept having issues with the ends of my hair getting all frizzy and breaking easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However if you take my application method as a guide, you&#x27;ll look like you have super healthy, shiny hair.</li>
      <li>Also it smells fantastic</li>
      <li>Makes hair light, silky and shiny.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s been a whole day and my hair still smells nice :</li>
      <li>but I also smooth it on my face &amp; hands.</li>
      <li>Works better than products I have paid more than twice as much</li>
      <li>This leaves her red hair shiny and great looking, while my long hair has a nice healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think it works better than John Frieda&#x27;s skinny serums and is very versatile.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great styling tool since it kinda provides a natural soft hold to my hair, so I can skip those yucky</li>
      <li>I wish that it had more of a penetrating effect, with long term results, but it works better than almost everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>but it works to calm my hair, i like to use it when its damp</li>
      <li>What it does is add great shine, although you have to be careful how much</li>
      <li>It leaves the hair soft and looking healthy.  </li>
      <li>And for my own locks I use just enough to get my palms covered.</li>
      <li>Once you figure out the right hair to serum ratio to use, this problem will be solved.</li>
      <li>It soaks in an leaves my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
      <li>it was the first time I bought a hair care thing.</li>
      <li>My hairdresser said she had never seen my hair in better health in the ten years she has been styling my hair.</li>
      <li>-)&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I can find it at Walmart&#x27;s because I have been pretty dissppointed since I only found it at CVS on one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>My daughter and I used the Moroccan Oil every second or third day and loved it.  </li>
      <li>Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save price is very competitive.</li>
      <li>This product should be used for very dry/brittle hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m ready for blow-drying.</li>
      <li>Works really well on my dry/frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This has a scent...can&#x27;t really put my finger on it</li>
      <li>MY HAIR FINALLY REALLY SHINES,</li>
      <li>Really good for thick hair helps with control and makes hair softer</li>
      <li>The strong smell doesn&#x27;t linger for to long.</li>
      <li>Tried many other options.</li>
      <li>the smell is not good at all, unlike other Moroccan/argan oils that smell wonderful.</li>
      <li>I used a full pump as directed and after about 5-6hrs out, my husband said I had a white film(?)</li>
      <li>This is the very BEST product I have ever used on my naturally curly, crazy hair.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic for overworked, dry, brittle, salon treated, or winter damaged hair.</li>
      <li>decent, it didn&#x27;t have the softness and shine it</li>
      <li>If you have natural african-american hair, this works really well.</li>
      <li>Literally my hair looks just as good, if not better than before I bleached it! :O</li>
      <li>would say I can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
      <li>It is more expensive, but worth every penny and lasts forever!</li>
      <li>I tried this product after trying Moroccan Oil for the first time recently.  </li>
      <li>but there&#x27;s a perfume that smells exactly the same.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Smells great AND doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily for very long afterwards (compared to other products that have just weighed down my hair and kept it looking oily all day).</li>
      <li>In fact most decent hair products are ridiculously over priced.</li>
      <li>My only  negatives (small) are that it does not &#x27;sleek&#x27; my kind of hair as much as I would like, and the effects dont seem to last all day.</li>
      <li>Received whole different product, I didn&#x27;t read anything about colored hair...</li>
      <li>Makes my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I put it in when hair is drying and its adds a natural, non greasy not too shiny luster.</li>
      <li>I accidentally found this product and it works beautifully on my naturally curly mane.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes to my natural hair after I put this stuff on.</li>
      <li>This does not seem to make the hair as soft or glossy as Moroccan Oil.  </li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, shiny, and manageable.  </li>
      <li>oil does what it says it does, and as long as you follow the instructions (my mom used like, half the bottle and her hair looked like a greaseball), you&#x27;ll get hair that gets compliments all day :)</li>
      <li>I put it in my hair right after a shower when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
      <li>This is very convenient product, i really like to use, my hair like silk after apply Loreal previous oil treatment oil, I definetly recoment this product.</li>
      <li>It definitely reduces frizz, improves softness, and is not difficult to blowdry your hair with it if you add it when wet.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of thick and not light.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This stuff is amazing I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years I put it in my hair right after a shower when it&#x27;s wet. I bleach/dye my hair blonde so my hair gets very dry and damaged and I don&#x27;t see myself not using this product I love it!!</li>
    <li> Love this oil - smells good, makes my hair soft. I use it after spraying on ApHogee leave in detangler, conditioner. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price. In fact most decent hair products are ridiculously over priced.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have been using it for a few years now. I think it works better than John Frieda&#x27;s skinny serums and is very versatile. I either use two or three pumps on my long mid back shoulder length dyed blonde hair when completely wet or a single pump when my hair is 70 percent dry. It definitely reduces frizz, improves softness, and is not difficult to blowdry your hair with it if you add it when wet. (makes more manageable) The worse part of many serums is either that weird hard to dry blowdry feeling once they are in, or ones that leave your hair limp and greasy or sticky when dry. Once you figure out the right hair to serum ratio to use, this problem will be solved. Not as delicious smelling as morrocan oil, but way cheaper and works maybe even a bit better.  I have used biosilk, John Frida, Paul M. skinny serum, Morrocan Oil, It&#x27;s a 10, Aargan Oil, Fredrick Fekkai and way more!</li>
    <li> I use this daily on my long, thick, damaged hair as a protectant and daily moisturizer. I wish that it had more of a penetrating effect, with long term results, but it works better than almost everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! It works and smells great</li>
    <li> I tried this product after trying Moroccan Oil for the first time recently.  My daughter and I used the Moroccan Oil every second or third day and loved it.  I just wasn&#x27;t so in love with the price and figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper option.  This does not seem to make the hair as soft or glossy as Moroccan Oil.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the small as much as M.O. and the container this one comes in is poorly designed, so that when one pumps, the oil tends to drizzle down the side of the bottle and get messy.  We will use the product up, but I have already replaced the Moroccan Oil and we are using that most days again.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair oil which i used.</li>
    <li> Argan Oil is a great product.  Leaves hair soft, shiny, and manageable.  Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save price is very competitive.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I bought because I kept having issues with the ends of my hair getting all frizzy and breaking easily. This stuff has helped my hair get stonger and I don&#x27;t have it frizzing at the ends anymore!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good oil for my hair, and this is definitely the product I am happy I found.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great AND doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily for very long afterwards (compared to other products that have just weighed down my hair and kept it looking oily all day).</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Fast shipping. Thank u!</li>
    <li> An excellent addition to thermal protection before using the Blowdryer.  This product softens, shines and eliminate frizz.  I would recommend the product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found to smooth out my frizzy hair. Works better than products I have paid more than twice as much for!&lt;br /&gt;Love it............</li>
    <li> I love this product. It soaks in an leaves my hair soft and tangle free.</li>
    <li> Received whole different product, I didn&#x27;t read anything about colored hair... This is bull.</li>
    <li> Works really well on my dry/frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> it was the first time I bought a hair care thing. its a gift for my friend, and I also bought one for myself</li>
    <li> Good product for the $. This product smooths and controls my hair without weighing it down. I thought I would have to spend a lot of money but Loreal makes good products and is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> If you want your hair to smell like.... and freezy go and get one. If not try another brand. Waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> MY HAIR FINALLY REALLY SHINES, NO MORE DRIED OUT OLD HAIR.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous, refined, oil!! Not only do I use it to tame my naturally curly, white hair but I also smooth it on my face &amp; hands. It is elegant &amp; silky :-)&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I can find it at Walmart&#x27;s because I have been pretty dissppointed since I only found it at CVS on one occasion.&lt;br /&gt;My idea of \\&quot; striking it rich\\&quot;  twould be to find  that Santa deposited a year&#x27;s supply  of Loreal Ever Sleek precious oil treatment in my stocking at Christmas:-) !!</li>
    <li> LOOOOOVE THIS!!!!!! I accidentally found this product and it works beautifully on my naturally curly mane. This product leaves my hair softer, shiny, and stronger. An excellent buy and must-have for unruly, curly hair.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and manageable.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair with great texture. The strong smell doesn&#x27;t linger for to long.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It makes your hair look silky and beautiful!  I use it on damp hair and also on dry hair; works great!</li>
    <li> As a whole , pleasant</li>
    <li> This is the very BEST product I have ever used on my naturally curly, crazy hair. Nothing compares with it! In fact, after I had been using it for a couple of months, I went to get my hair cut. My hairdresser said she had never seen my hair in better health in the ten years she has been styling my hair. LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> i use it on my ends or through the bottom half of my hair. its oil so dont go overboard. but it works to calm my hair, i like to use it when its damp so it doesnt dry frizzy. works well enough i would get it again</li>
    <li> I recenty bleached my hair and though my hair looked...... decent, it didn&#x27;t have the softness and shine it used to have. My hair is naturally straight and quite thin, so I have to be really careful with hair oils, or else it&#x27;ll look greasy. I recently found this at Rexall for $6 and I decided to give it a try. It only took 1 little pump of this stuff and Oh My Lord my hair felt like it just got done at a salon! Literally my hair looks just as good, if not better than before I bleached it! :O Also it smells fantastic, it&#x27;s been a whole day and my hair still smells nice :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil does what it says it does, and as long as you follow the instructions (my mom used like, half the bottle and her hair looked like a greaseball), you&#x27;ll get hair that gets compliments all day :)</li>
    <li> Makes hair light, silky and shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product worked well on my hair, which is short and unprocessed. It leaves the hair soft and looking healthy.  My only  negatives (small) are that it does not &#x27;sleek&#x27; my kind of hair as much as I would like, and the effects dont seem to last all day. However,  it is the best oil that I have found for my purposes.  If you have natural african-american hair, this works really well.</li>
    <li> This is very convenient product, i really like to use, my hair like silk after apply Loreal previous oil treatment oil, I definetly recoment this product.</li>
    <li> This product should be used for very dry/brittle hair. I have normal hair and even a little drop made it very heavy and greasy. I also don&#x27;t like that there is no heat protectant in this. My advice: use Redken Heat Glide instead. It is more expensive, but worth every penny and lasts forever!</li>
    <li> We all love Morrocanoil. But this is a great substitute if you are on a budget, or rather save the money and buy some more hair products to try. I put a touch of this stuff on my hair ends everyday. It smells great and feels sleek, as they say it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it on my hair before I curl my hair. It&#x27;s a great styling tool since it kinda provides a natural soft hold to my hair, so I can skip those yucky hairsprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say I can&#x27;t live without this product. I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it makes to my natural hair after I put this stuff on. You go L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
    <li> This product --with it&#x27;s precious Argan Oil -- isn&#x27;t a detangler nor much of a conditioner, but what it does do brilliantly is add shine to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on my daughter&#x27;s short, spiky, processed hair and my long totally natural hair. What it does is add great shine, although you have to be careful how much you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally use just a dot on my daughter&#x27;s hair. I spread the oil over my fingertips and then rub them over her head, trying to keep away from her scalp. And for my own locks I use just enough to get my palms covered. I then brush them over the surface of my dry hair, not trying to penetrate to lower levels--just the surface. This leaves her red hair shiny and great looking, while my long hair has a nice healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you don&#x27;t want to do is use too much, especially next to your scalp (unless you want to look like you haven&#x27;t washed your hair recently) nor anywhere else. This is because this is an oil. And oils can make your hair clump and look stringy and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you take my application method as a guide, you&#x27;ll look like you have super healthy, shiny hair. The oil also smooths down some frizzes, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy Eversleek if this is the principle result you are looking for.</li>
    <li> This product is not by any means an 100% frizz-buster as it claims. It also does not leave your hair looking sleek. What I love about it, though, is that it is a very effective detangler for my curly hair and leaves my hair wonderfully soft.</li>
    <li> This review is based on my hair! I have thick, naturally wavy, long hair...and lots of it too!&lt;br /&gt;I think this item is a so so product. For $10, you can achieve amazing looking hair temporarily. This has a scent...can&#x27;t really put my finger on it but there&#x27;s a perfume that smells exactly the same. It&#x27;s not overbearing but definitely not my type of scent. It&#x27;s close to Marc Jacobs sort of scent.&lt;br /&gt;The product does leave my hair feeling slick and shiny but I would definitely not use more than half a pump to achieve it. I used a full pump as directed and after about 5-6hrs out, my husband said I had a white film(?) on my hair. Gross!&lt;br /&gt;As for lasting effect/over time, I have not seen any improvement in texture or shine.</li>
    <li> Really good for thick hair helps with control and makes hair softer</li>
    <li> I bought this the other day and it&#x27;s just alright. It&#x27;s kind of thick and not light. the smell is not good at all, unlike other Moroccan/argan oils that smell wonderful. I am disappointed in this product especially for that price.</li>
    <li> Good product for hair that&#x27;s a bit dull. I put it in when hair is drying and its adds a natural, non greasy not too shiny luster.</li>
    <li> I love this ! Have been using it for several years. I put on damp hair, get out the tangles and I&#x27;m ready for blow-drying.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic for overworked, dry, brittle, salon treated, or winter damaged hair. Took the frizziness out of my hair which is 3/4 length down my back. I cut the use with a little Sea Plasma to help it go further. Works great.</li>
    <li> We use it as a detangler and conditioner for adults and kids with long hair. Tried many other options. This is by far the best. Does not weight the hair down and doesn&#x27;t make it greasy. For some reason they&#x27;ve stopped selling it in stores in the northeast and now sell some awful other spritz kind instead. Amazon was one of the few places that still sells it.</li>
