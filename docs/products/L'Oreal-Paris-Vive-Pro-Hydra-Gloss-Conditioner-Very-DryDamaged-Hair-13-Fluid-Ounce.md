<li> then tried some on my hair, just a little dab</li>
<li> I tried MUCH more expensive products, too, and my hair was weak and felt thin.</li>

    <li> This product works pretty well for me. It smells really good and adds a little shine to your hair. I can never find it in stores though :(</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product many times in the past and have been happy, this time very unhappy. The bottles all came to me opened and leaked out the conditioner, they charged me for one bottle I didn&#x27;t get!!!</li>
    <li> I used the first order and my hair fell out a lot in the tub.  It also left my hair heavy with and no sheen.  I returned my second order.</li>
    <li> nice smell not great product</li>
    <li> I have thick, curly, dry hair and this product worked OK.  My hair felt smoother, but it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as Joico does for me. I will switch back even though it will cost me much more.</li>
    <li> I have dry, naturally curly hair, and this conditioner works great. It makes my hair feel so smooth, and it smells so good when I use it.</li>
    <li> di what the manual promised. But I learned that I have really need only a very little of this to get the most beautyful hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and I have them straightened by Keratin. These hair products works well for me. It&#x27;s a pity can no longer find these products at local store. I am happy I can still order them online.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells lovely and makes hair feel silky soft after using. I detracted one star because it had no long-term lasting effects.</li>
    <li> I asked for the condioner but they sent the shampoo. I was looking forward to the conditoner. I might order the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Not bad, but not a substitute for pureology ! Way cheaper than other hair products my highlighted hair is still hard to comb through with this,</li>
    <li> Purchased for great value. Product makes my wavy/coarse hair far less frizzy and far more manageable!! :D Would re-order f&#x27;sure!!</li>
    <li> doesnt make a difference to my hair.......and kinda pricy comparing to other products that dont make a difference to my hair... u know...</li>
    <li> This works GREAT for my very curly hair. I use it as a cowash and I use it as a leave in. Be careful not to be too heavy handed if you&#x27;re going to leave it in and I&#x27;m always sure to apply an oil to my hair to seal it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It works very well on dry hair.  Too bad it is discontinued, but I&#x27;m glad I can order it online for a few more bucks.</li>
    <li> Took a chance on ordering this with the shampoo.  Very nice for the after rinse.  My dry hair needs some nourishment or it will fly all over but this seems to work well.  Would receommend.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is nice. Does the job but isn&#x27;t too heavy and doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. The smell is very nice.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful conditioner for dry hair.  It keeps the moisture in and smells fantastic.  I can only hope they bring it back one day.</li>
    <li> Everyone one family grabs this conditioner and loves it.  Great results and wonderful scent.</li>
    <li> I new that L&#x27;Oreal Paris, had great products.  The reason I came to amazon to purchase conditioner, was specifically to pick up the hard to find product.  It was much BETTER, than I expected.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully for dry hair, much cheaper than many products</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for my 93-year old aunt whose hair has become very dry and brittle in her old age. After a couple of uses, she noticed her hair becoming much softer and more manageable. Good product, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if my rating for the shampoo will appear with this, so I&#x27;ll be brief:  winter, dry hair, like to wash every day, this stuff keeps my hair looking good even in the cold, dry weather.</li>
    <li> Thought L&#x27;Oreal might not be making this. No one seemed to carry it. It is my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; rinse when I or the stylist have parched my delicate blonde hair. This seems to hydrate it in just one or two uses. Glad to find this here!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, but I can get it at Dollar General for $2.50.  My hair feels so silky &amp; soft &amp; smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> To bad it&#x27;s been discontinued...</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell and leaves your hair very shiny.  I woul order this again, gooo price for a good product.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product</li>
    <li> Alas, Loreal doesn&#x27;t make this conditioner anymore! I use it as a leave in conditioner on my naturally curly African American hair. It adds shine and softness and really brings out the curl. I suspect it&#x27;s the royal jelly in it. Great conditioner that will be sorely missed!</li>
    <li> Tis is quality hair rinse and smells great! Seller shipped promptly!</li>
    <li> I got this for my daughter (three years old) and I because we both have very fine and easy to tangle hair. It is a nice light conditioner, with a mild pleasant smell.

    <li> I grew a Beard for Christmas a Big One and it is unmanageable, this helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried some on my hair, just a little dab and I liked it made my hair more manageable for shorter hair&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I have full head of hair and it just goes all over the place this worked and trained it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue how it will work with women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously very good quality.</li>
    <li> As I wrote the review above for the shampoo, I love this shampoo and contitioner, it makes your hair so very soft and silky.  I color my hair and this conditioner gives it a nice shine.  I highly recommend it if you can find it.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best, too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in the stores anymore.  My husband says it smells great too!</li>
    <li> I was tired of what I was finding at the dollar store and the drug stores and had to find another product to add to an order to get my free shipping so I chose this. I am so glad I did. I have horrid hair..dried out from decades of overprocessing and disdain..This stuff makes it feel like human hair. Nice.</li>
    <li> I discovered this line when my stylist recommended it to me. The price was so low (at Ulta or the grocery stores) I could hardly believe how great it was. L&#x27;Oreal discontinued it and I began to try other shampoos. My hair started to feel like cotton, instead of silky and strong. Even my BFF noticed the difference and thought I was losing my hair! The new line from L&#x27;Oreal is dreadful. I tried MUCH more expensive products, too, and my hair was weak and felt thin. Who knew shampoo and conditioner could make SUCH a difference, especially when they are only on your hair for a few minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had to pay about 3x what this USED to cost, I stocked up on a year&#x27;s supply. Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when the day comes that I can&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
    <li> The L&#x27;Oreal products work wonders with my naturally curly kinky hair. Helps give it the moisture I need without weighing it down too much</li>
    <li> I used it with its shampoo and love them both. My hair was extremely damaged with usage of hair driers and lost hope that anything could help me. But L&#x27;Oreal Paris Vive Pro Hydra Gloss Conditioner really lets me feel my hair beauty on a daily basis. I&#x27;ll re-order it, for sure.</li>
    <li> great product/ great seller</li>
    <li> was not moisturizing my air as expected it.</li>
