<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just got my order of ARKO Shaving Soap in a bowl and I must say its a keeper, I was a little apprehensive about trying it after I read some of the reviewers on here and other web sites that claim it has a Rank smell that takes some getting use to,  which is why I prepared myself for the smell of Limburger Cheese or a dead animal when I first opened it,  But the only thing I smelled was the smell of the old barber shops of my youth and my Grandmothers wash room on the farm, In fact it really smells like the old fashion Ivory Soap we use to use when we took what was known as a Saturday Night Bath. I just held my brush under the hot water and stuck it in the bowl and gave it a couple of twist to load up the brush and that is all that is needed to work up a nice thick lather. ARKO has been producing this shave soap for well over a 100 years so I guess that says it all.</li>
    <li> It looked interesting in my search for Shaving Soap.  Proraso remains my favorite and at 150g compared to 90g Arko is about the same price.  I love the texture and smell of Proraso compared to Arko.&lt;br /&gt;The Arko tub is smaller and thinner with a screw top, so some will argue it is great for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;For home and my hands definitely love the Proraso tub, especially for larger brushes.</li>
    <li> First couple of times using it the lather was a bit insipid, but got much richer after the soap &#x27;softened&#x27; a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but the scent is like from an episode of MacGyver where, for some reason, dude needed to make a fragrance using only the items from the closet where your grandmother keeps her cleaning supplies. Mmmmm, furniture polish...</li>
    <li> no lathering and not very protective. The smell is good though.</li>
    <li> I often buy artisan soaps for $12 to $30 because I&#x27;m into wet shaving.  I&#x27;ve always been curious about Arko.  I&#x27;ve heard the scent is a love it or hate it thing.  Well, I love it.  I love fresh, clean, and a good soap smell.  This has tallow and offers a great shave.  I&#x27;m really impressed.  Will definitely keep it in my rotation.</li>
    <li> The best Shave soap that exists.. Great smell, ladder, packege comes very practical. Sure i&amp;#34;ll order three more.. So gave a try you will not be desapointed.</li>
    <li> This soap smells very clean and fresh. Works great too.</li>
    <li> I like this product it works great stores well and seems to last awhile. If the price was more reasonable or there was a good bulk discount I would have no problem with 5 stars. Oh and by the way just regular soap works fine as well.</li>
    <li> UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2015:  I have continued to use Arko for several months and it is by far the best shave soap I have ever used!  Be sure to use a lot of water with it.  Next order I&#x27;m going to grate Arko sticks with a cheese grater and just a little bit of a Derby Shave Stick for the scent and mash them into a bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried Arko hard round shave puck for the first time.  It was a disaster.  A lot of drag and tugging.  Gave it a second try and it was wonderful.  It&#x27;s like it wasn&#x27;t even the same soap except for the good soapy smell it gives off.  I used more water the second time and it was the best shave ever.  No drag, no weepers, no nicks, and super smooth shave.  Plenty of creamy lather and protection.  I didn&#x27;t know my face could feel so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also convinced that hard shave pucks need to, for lack of a better term, age one time before use.  In other words, soak the hard puck in super hot water for a few minutes, lather but do not shave with that first later, rinse, and allow to sit and age with a few drops of water for 24 to 48 hours before you actually use it to shave.  Have you ever noticed how if a traditional bar of hand soap sits in a puddle of water for a day the entire bar is softer and gives off more lather?  Same with this soap.  Break it in (season it) and you will have the best shaves ever!</li>
    <li> Great shaves with this, lathers up really well with a brush.  The scent is a little &amp;#34;lemon pledge&amp;#34; for my taste.</li>
    <li> Great shaving soap.  The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as described by others.  It is a clean smell and isnt too overwhelming.  It lathers easily with badger brush and it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Great for everyday shaving!</li>
    <li> I have heard of Arko and read about Arko.  How it good it is and how inexpensive it is.  Let me say it smells great, lathers great and provides a great shave.  I will always have this on my shelf.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving soap. I bought the tub so I would not need to bring my shaving mug on business trips. The smell is nice and lathers really well.</li>
    <li> Good, works as a expected!</li>
    <li> I am an avid shaving soap collector and have about 20 different kinds on my shelf. I enjoy changing up soaps every few days but find that, more often than not, I come back to Arko.  I like the clean lemony smell, find the lather to be thick, and provides a good cushion.  Although I can create a good lather directly from the bowl, I prefer to load my boar bristle brush and whip up the soap in a copper shaving bowl.  This makes the lather even better.  I use a lemon after shave which compliments the soap. I don&#x27;t think you can beat this soap for the price. This is also a long-lasting soap; it takes very little effort to create a thick lather.</li>
    <li> very simple but pleasing scent, lather is great!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best everyday soap I&#x27;ve used. The lather is super rich and the scent is light.</li>
    <li> Initially tried it and didn&#x27;t think it was that bad, smelled like cheap soap. Then, after it had been sitting in the shaving cup over night, the smell took over the bathroom. Needless to say it went in the garbage shortly there after. I read a review the smell eventually mellows out - ya, no thanks. I really wanted to like Arko, man I can&#x27;t get past that smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I really wanted to give Arko another chance so I purchased the stick version. I actually don&#x27;t mind the smell of stick version. It is not as strong as puck version.I pressed it into a glass jar with lid and its actually a great soap.Lathers great and gives good protection. I use a Merkur 34C HD DE. and recently learned how to shim the razor to make it more aggressive. IE make your own adjustable razor without buying another one. The Arko worked great and have no issues with razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like stick version, do not like puck version. Worth checking out stick version.</li>
    <li> l love this soap.  It lathers easily &amp; gives great protection while straight razor shaving.  I&#x27;d buy this again!</li>
    <li> Bought this shaving soap alongside my LORD L6 Safety Razor, it has worked out wonderfully.. producing a nice lather i can apply after whisking about the frail brush i own. I highly recommend it, specially for the soft almost imperceptible aroma it leaves after the shave.</li>
    <li> After fifty years of wet shaving I feel I know something about what I like in shaving soap.  This is an excellent buy in shaving soap. It is slick and has a nice, clean smell.  The price can&#x27;t be beat. You can&#x27;t go wrong on this one.</li>
    <li> It has a very soapy smell, and barely works up a lather on my brush (at least in hard water). What lather I do manage to get going on my beard kind of dissolves by mid-shave. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any kind of oils or other additives in here to either lubricate the blade or soften the beard. I can honestly say it&#x27;s about the quality of dollar store tallow soap. I probably won&#x27;t finish this tub out, preferring instead to order an Italian brand. (Sorry Turkey. Your hummus is fantastic. Your shaving soap... not so great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated: On the advise of another buyer, I soaked (or actually, re-soaked) the soap in water. Apparently the first soaking wasn&#x27;t enough. The lathering greatly improved after that, resulting in a thick, long-lasting lather. Lubrication is still lacking, and the sharp scent of tallow soap remains. I upgraded this to 3 out of 5 stars, however.</li>
    <li> Good scent, rich later, terrific value.  You can pay two or three times as much for shaving soap and get poorer results.  I&#x27;ve used Arko for the past month and have found it easy to work up a thick, covering lather and haven&#x27;t nicked my sensitive skin.  The bowl it comes in is little more than a package for transport, however.  It&#x27;s too small to use as a shaving bowl.</li>
    <li> Very boring, smells like soap.&lt;br /&gt;It works fine, I prefer sandlewood.</li>
    <li> It lathers and lubricates very well, rinses clean and smells good. It&#x27;s very lightly scented,  reminds me of ivory soap and that scent does fade completely away after a half hour or so.</li>
    <li> Classic. Great lather, clean scent (though not everybody&#x27;s cup of tea), and probably one of the best values in shaving soap. If you don&#x27;t have a puck or a stick of Arko you owe it to yourself to drop a couple bucks and try it out; there aren&#x27;t many cheaper experiments on Earth. You may find that you love it... that was the case for me.</li>
    <li> For wet shaving, you can&#x27;t ask for any better than Arko. I highly recommend this, especially with the resurgence of wet shaving these days, to beginners who want something easy to lather.&lt;br /&gt;Honesty, I simply put a hot, wet brush after a few shakes on the puck and rub it around. My lather is almost instant and is enough for 3 passes. I was a lover of razorock, but this stuff is cheaper and more effective. And to say that about my Razorock is really saying something.</li>
    <li> Wow great Soap. I recently got into DE shaving and have ordered a handful of cremes and soaps. This has by far been the best and cheapest option for me. I use a Boar Brush and face lather technique and it works excellent. Provides Really good protection and i use a Feather Blade.</li>
    <li> I ddn&#x27;t care for the lather and or the smell. Not worth a purchase even with a bargain price.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is surprisingly good shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Its important to spend your money on things you get to keep and not things you wash down the drain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends got into this retro shaving craze because its a fad!  They buy feather blades (garbage), $60 soap, and whatever else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy a $300 razor... Fine as long as its used and already depreciated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got into this for the savings... I was investigating shave clubs and found no matter what people say the club blades are not better than a mach 3 and certainly not as good as mach 4.  But these olds school blades!!!  AMAZING. I tried all the common blades from around the world and several cheap soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is great for the price and I recommend bluebird, derby, and shark blades.  Dont change them early... They are best after being work in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways this is the soap for real men.  Not prissy guys who got into this because they read the art of manliness book!  Men dont need to be told how to be men and they dont need $60 soap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your not saving money shaving with safety razors then stop!  Because THEY DO NOT work better than a pro fusion glide or mach 4!  They just dont!  They work as well as and cost next to nothing!  But youll never be able to shave mirrorless in the shower without shaving creme like you can with a pro fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nuff said.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving soap I have used. I feel like an idiot for paying $20 for pucks of fancy shaving soap that doesn&#x27;t lather near as well as this stuff does.</li>
    <li> A very cheap shaving soap with a unique scent and great performance.  Really good Slickness.  I use it when I want a simple shave or I go on trips.  If you haven&#x27;t tried it, I recommend.  It&#x27;ll only set you back a couple bucks.</li>
    <li> Gave a good lather, did the job.</li>
    <li> I normally use razorrock and decided to give arko a try and I have to say that there is no comparison. Razorrock is 10 times better than arko. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> A good simple soap IS still best! Lathers easy, really easy, so that your shave is as good as it gets. The smell is....well...a soap smell. Not bad not great just a simple soap smell so that my after shave can do it&#x27;s job of making me smell good to the ladies.  This soap is now firmly on my &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; list of shaving supplies.</li>
    <li> Probably why it is so inexpensive is there is little or no fragrance added.  Its odor is much like Ivory hand soap; their old-style, regular type.  Yet, this shaving soap makes a fine lather and I could not more pleased with it, esp. at the price point!      This is a no-frills shaving soap, but lather well and does the job great.  For those with more sensitive skin, add a bit of glycerin to your puck with the dash of water when lathering.      Arko shaving soaps are inexpensive but function well.</li>
    <li> The same amazing tallow based soap I live in a bowl instead of a stick!!! Love this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 6 months now and it works great...and contrary to some reviews, it does not smell like pee or old lady&#x27;s hair.  It has a nice clean, refreshing odor...a makes you want to shave odor.  It lathers up nicely and lasts long.  This is an excellent product that&#x27;s worth a try.  You&#x27;ll love it.  I do.</li>
    <li> Lathers very well, but very strong aroma.  It&#x27;s not unpleasant, just strong!</li>
    <li> Soap is good, nice scent and lathers well, bowl not deep enough</li>
    <li> Anyone who has ever used an Arko shaving soap stick will be familiar with the soap in this container. The container itself is great as it provides an easy way to pack your soap away when wet from shaving which can be a little messier with the shaving sticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those unfamiliar with Arko shaving soap, it has a scent similar to that of Ivory brand bar soap, which is to say a very soapy somewhat lemony aroma that people either love or hate. It lathers incredibly easily in basically any water condition (from hard water to soft) and the lather is thick and slick and will provide excellent protection for your face while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly if Arko was available in a wider range of scents, people would probably never look elsewhere for a good shaving soap.</li>
    <li> Great shave soap. I like the bowl packaging alot, very classic. Some complain about the scent and liken it to a hotel soap. I on the other hand quite enjoy the scent this shave soap has, it reminds me of a barber shop that I used to go to with my grandpa as a kid. Its simple, gives a great shave what else do you need</li>
    <li> Update: I was reading on some forums and read a suggestion that helped with the smell. Leaving the lid off for about half of a day lets the strong smell dissipate. Now I can use this soap without having the smell last all day and it no longer bothers me. Before trying this I was about to throw this away. Now I will definitely be using this. I&#x27;ve tried this soap with 3 different blades so far (Gillette 7&#x27;oclock sharpedge, Derby, and Astra Superiour Platinum) and it works great with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got into shaving with a safety razor and starting looking into shaving soaps to improve the quality of the shave. After reading multiple reviews and forums I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and highly recommended. I was able to get a good lather with this using a boars hair brush. The shave was very comfortable and close. I would love this soap and continue to buy it if it wasn&#x27;t for the smell. I loved everything about it but the smell. Many people seem to like it but I just don&#x27;t If you don&#x27;t mind the smell or happen to like it I highly recommend it. For me it was to much. It wasn&#x27;t the worst smell but the main problem is it&#x27;s really strong and lingers for hours. It took about 10+ hrs before I couldn&#x27;t smell it any more. To me it smells like a cheap bath soap but magnified a 100 times.</li>
    <li> Since I got into wet shaving I&#x27;ve been reading of the cult like following of Arko, after getting some I see why. It&#x27;s got an awesome scent, lathers up easy even with my hard water and gives great protection. I will ALWAYS have some Arko in my shave den.</li>
    <li> OK, so I have only used this once... and I am sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s inexpensive. It makes a very nice lather with a little work. The lather has staying power, good endurance to the cushion. I like the smell, It reminds me of barbers. I think this is my everyday soap now. I&#x27;ll save my foofoo wool fat organic free range tallow exotic essential oil stuff for special days.</li>
    <li> Awesome shave soap.  It lathers nicely and works for shaving.  The smell is masculine and what I wanted for a shave soap.  The smell does go away when you are done shaving.  I think this is my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Great lather, nice travel type tub, good price. The scent is barbershop , nothing unique or strong, so it is a good basic soap that doesn&#x27;t conflict with the aftershaves I use on a normal day (Clubman, Old Spice.) I also use Proraso Green, Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood, and Brothers Grimm Smolder for more luxurious shaving but find those to be strongly scented and best when used  in combination with their respective aftershaves. Arko is a good fit for an everyday basic soap, and has replaced Williams Mug Soap on my shelf mainly because it lathers up better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I purchased this soap because I had heard that Arko produces a thick, rich lather, even with hard water. Unfortunately, I have not found that to be the case. With my relatively hard tap water, Arko does not lather noticeably better than any other hard shaving soap I have used.</li>
    <li> Works good! Smells good! Easy to lather! Puck fits in an old spice mug too! Reasonably priced compared to $25 - $30 boutique soaps!</li>
    <li> Gave this to a friend before i got use it, but he loves it and said that you cannot find a soap that lathers better. The sent was very appealing, smels like the barborshops i use to go to when i was a kid. Going to have to buy another and try it myslef lol.</li>
    <li> From my husband - The best lathering soap bar none, easy on the skin, smells nice, and won&#x27;t clog any razor even the 5 blades ones (not just safety razor). This is so much more economical than any pressure-dispensed shaving foam or gel and works better too.</li>
    <li> Dries too fast and leaves skin dry after use. I have heard from others that it is good so it may just be my skin. Now I use almost exclusively proraso.</li>
    <li> Very nice soap with a traditional scent. It provides nice cushion and lubrication. The lather wasn&#x27;t very thick, but it did the job in providing a very nice and close shave.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest and best shaving soap out there.&lt;br /&gt;For daily use I suggest the bars as they are slightly cheaper and more or less exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;All ARKO Shaving Soap has that strange aroma that drives some folks bonkers, but I just unwrap/ open the container a few days (weeks actually...) and the smell dwindles to (almost) nothing. But beware..., if you really detest that smell, it&#x27;s here as in the bar.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t really bother me, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Great shaving soap. Perfect for mess free travel.</li>
    <li> Lathers up easily, love the smell, gives a smooth shave. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> You will be very pleased with this shaving soap. First is that is in a convenient carry cup for traveling. Second is the scent. It smells like a cross between ivory soap and lemon soap. Thirdly and most important is the lather it produces. This inexpensive soap produces a thick and rich lather that most $30 dollar shave soaps don&#x27;t come close two. The shave is close and comfortable. Buy this soap!</li>
    <li> Product lives up to a lot of the reviews I read here. It&#x27;s lathers up very very good. The smell of the soap has a barber shop smell to it. Not exactly like ivory soap but a soap smell. Not un pleasent but a soap smell. If you are looking for a fancy smelling product this is not it, but if you are looking for a product that lathers up and provides a great barrier for you razor this soaps for you. I use other soaps and creams in my rotation of shaving. I prefer a sandalwood scent as my favorite. The reason I gave it 5 stars is because it lives up to what it claims. Great lather and great barrier quality. Not my favorite smell but not a bad smell either.</li>
    <li> Good shave soap but couldn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;into&#x27; the scent. :Gave to a friend. He likes it.</li>
    <li> Nice soapy scent, very good glide and cushioning. Leaves skin clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend much more but this soap really is highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;On all the wet shaving forums.</li>
    <li> Very good. Does a great job.</li>
    <li> It works very well it&#x27;s the first soap that I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to put lather gets up in texture and great for a very smooth and comfortable shave I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Super easy to lather! great for beginners and I personally like the smell :) just beware the smell isnt for everyone but most can tolerate it that ive seen because of the great lather.</li>
    <li> Works great I have been wet shaving for 2 years now and I get a close shave with no nicks.  And I also am a cold water shaver. It lathers very thick. The smell takes a little to get use to but it&#x27;s not bad and it don&#x27;t linger after your done.</li>
    <li> Great lather &amp; smooth fell,ideal for travel on the go!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new guy to traditional wet-shaving and this stuff is the best out of everything I&#x27;ve tried.  A must-have in your shave den.</li>
    <li> For the price, you will not find a better puck. This stuff lathers in the snap of a finger and provides cushion for several strokes in the same spot, (if you get a few stubborn hairs). If you face lather and want a good soap for a good price, look no further. It has a soapy smell, not a shaving soap smell. Some may like it, some may not. I personally love Mitchells Wool Fat. For the price, I&#x27;ll take this just because it doesn&#x27;t have to be prepped like Mitchells. Hit it with a wet boar brush and go to town. Great soap for a great price if you don&#x27;t mind a bar soap smell. Try it!</li>
    <li> Works exactly like a bowl of solid shave soap should. Rinse your shaving brush in hot water, touch it to the soap surface and gently swirl it around. In under a minute you&#x27;ll have better lather than any can will provide. It has a very mild smell. No perfume. When done, let dry and replace lid until next shave. It also lasts for months.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying the scent is a strong lemony scent that I couldn&#x27;t stand right out of the package. But, after letting it air out in the closet for a couple dies it has mellowed out enough to where I don&#x27;t mind it. As for performance it&#x27;s great. Very easy to load and lather with lots of cushion and slickness for the blade to glide across. For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat and is definitly the best bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> This is a cheaper shaving soap but good enough. Its smell is pleasant and faint enough not to overpower or linger too long. I also bought it in the stick form, which I think is easier to apply. I think I will buy the sticks when the bowl is empty.</li>
    <li> Arko soap sticks have been my standard shaving soap for about 4 years now. Used a few different brands, mostly the ones that come out of tubes. My facial hair is thick and grows quickly, so I need a soap that produces thick lather and moisture so that the razor does not pull on my stubs - especially if I have not shaved for two days. Arko soap sticks provided the best lather so far, and since then I decided to stick with Arko. The lather consistently good and you gotta like the smell. Not sure what the aroma comes from but definitely adds to the shaving experience (especially if you are using a traditional razor blade, makes you feel as if you are in a completely different part of the world for a few minutes).  I noticed this bowl version a few months ago, and ordered one to test it out. Turned out to be the same as the stick, which is great, but the plus is that it fits perfectly to my standard sized shaving bowl. Should have ordered a few, since it is no longer available. Hope they bring it back to Amazon before I run out.</li>
    <li> A really nice, inexpensive shaving soap that produces a good protective lather. It seems that people either love or hate the smell. Much to my surprise, the moment I smelled it I was flooded with memories of my father shaving in the early 1960s. Perhaps Arko is similar to old U.S. shaving soaps? Maybe it&#x27;s last century&#x27;s idea of what clean smelled like.</li>
    <li> Having used the comparable Arko shave stick before, I wanted to try the shave bowl.  The main problem I had with the stick was that even with a wet brush, I had trouble working the product into a decent lather.  The bowl version has the same great lemony scent but I found it far easy to work into a lather for a good wet shave.  I love their packaging and plan to find another use for the used container once the soap is gone.</li>
    <li> it does a great lather, but it has a laundry soap smell.</li>
    <li> The best lather razor glides through it</li>
    <li> Nice solid soap...I love the size...the scent seems to be an issue with a lot of people, but for me it smells like an old school bar of soap....lathers up quickly and easily...can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> The lather is pretty good, especially for the price. I wasn&#x27;t a HUGE fan of the smell, it kind of smells like a urinal cake to me. I found that some people love the smell and some people really hate it. My &amp;#34;theory&amp;#34; is that some people posses a gene that allows them to smell the urinal cake smell.</li>
    <li> If the scent was better this would receive 5 starts. Overall, this is a nice shaving cream. Excellent lathering,  though not enough lubrication of the shave. It&#x27;s better than the Proraso I bought at the same time as this. I mainly bought this one for travel purposes. But since I tried and disliked the Proraso, I figured I would try this one at home before traveling. Not as good as Taylor of Old Bond Street, but for the price, I could not ask for more. Shipping was fast. Will probably buy again.</li>
    <li> Very smooth feeling against the beard, it lubricates the shaving surface quite well.  The scent is a little off, sort of like a soapy type smell, it does not matter, I use after shave or lotion.</li>
    <li> Arko you either love it or hate it, it seems.  Some detest the smell.  Some love the smell, but I&#x27;ve never heard anyone complain about the lather!  I personally absolutely love the clean citrus smell of Arko.  Arko produces a lovely thick rich lather without trying. At the ridiculously low price of Arko, shame on you for not giving it a try.........</li>
    <li> My favorite lather.  Will reorder when it&#x27;s time.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful soap! It creates a lot of lather and looks like it will last a long time!  I am a beginner with this stuff, so if I can make it work, it must be pretty user friendly!  I plan to buy more of this, but in stick form.</li>
    <li> Not so impressed with this product. It does work but I do not particularly enjoy the urinal cake scent.  For shaving soap I am sticking with Tabac and Cella!</li>
    <li> Great deal, will continue to buy.  Lathers better than any other shaving soaps I have used.</li>
    <li> As good as any other soap I&#x27;ve used. I love the smell, I love the ease of lathering, I love the way it provides a slick and protective surface, I love the ease with which it rinses off. A perfect shaving soap. I have a number of different shaving soaps--not nearly as many as some--but a few top performers including Catie&#x27;s Bubbles, Cella, and Razorock XXX. Arko, at a fraction of the price, is right there with them.</li>
    <li> No joke, this stuff really does smell like a urinal cake. Looking at online forums people either love it or hate it. I now know which one I am</li>
    <li> In a world of men&#x27;s grooming products that are prissy and made to pamper, Arko is the old-school guy who gives you a firm handshake, looks you in the eye, and does his job without complaining. Arko performs, and he performs exceptionally well. It&#x27;s that simple. Shaving soap gives you a better shave than canned goop or cream because it strips your stubble of natural oils that leave it much more primed to be cut away. Prep brush, whip up the soap, lather up and cut the facial grass. The best and closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had was with Arko, and I&#x27;m sold on it. Low-key inexpensive soap that is made to keep a gentleman looking clean and handsome, a great value.</li>
    <li> Arko rocks. Great shave soap for next to nothing.</li>
    <li> If you like using a  shaving brush, this is much easier and neater to use than the squeeze tube some brands come in or the stick Arko comes in.</li>
    <li> Soap is good, lathers we&#x27;ll. some complain about the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, smells like a classic barber shop. Would suggest everyone try this soap!</li>
    <li> great soap not that hard to lather has a lemony smell. really good for the price</li>
    <li> Great value, great smell and great foam.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s shaving soap, what else can you say?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order this again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Never liked smearing the sticks on my face before lathering. With this I can lather in the bowl.  I use it with my Arc 5 by Panasonic. It&#x27;s just the right slickness and hangs on through the whole shave leaving me with an even closer shave than lecric shave. A little more messy but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Arko shaving stick in the past. I bought the bowl to travel with. It worked out great. I prefer a bowl to a stick anyway. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It is okay may be behind the times</li>
    <li> Soap works well, could smell a little less like a shoe cream bit it works well and is manly.</li>
    <li> smells like my grandfather</li>
    <li> I like the smell and the lather it makes but I&#x27;m allergic to it so I can&#x27;t use it,</li>
    <li> Great lather and the container is ideal for travel. Holds moisture well after application. The scent is a little strange, but I will probably become accustomed to it.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this soap. Not quite as much as I enjoy using the soap stick, but pretty darn close.</li>
    <li> I like this soap, has a refreshing classic barber shop smell.......Go with Proraso Red tub though-------trust me its the best!</li>
    <li> I have used it a few times now and I was not that impressed. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong? It dries up way to way to fast even after my brush was drenched to try and combat the soap drying to fast (it smells.......funny, too). Granted it&#x27;s inexpensive, I still expected a little better though. As I said, this is just my opinion based on first hand experience/</li>
    <li> The smell is not bad at all, even refreshing. Smooth larger with much less soap and water. Perfect shave. If you are not using this, you should be.</li>
    <li> Shaved with this for the first time today, first time ever with a shaving soap. I usually use a shaving gel. Im sold on shaving soap now! Great clean smell which made my face feel moisturized and clean. The shave it self was the closet i have had in a long time even with a already used disposable razor.</li>
    <li> This soap performs quite well if you don&#x27;t mind the odor; as some have mentioned some like it, some don&#x27;t. I like it well enough to keep it for occasional use.</li>
    <li> It lathers really well and gives a nice shave but I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> lathers good, price is low, but it smells like an old womans hair.</li>
    <li> Great Product, Fast S&amp;H.</li>
    <li> Found Arko to be a great replacement for the canned foam I was using. It does have a stronger soap smell that might bother some, but non issue for me</li>
    <li> Arko is an awesome soap.&lt;br /&gt;The container is flimsy.</li>
    <li> great lather and nice scent.....recommend.....</li>
    <li> Smells like lemon pledge, not a bad thing. I&#x27;ve used 10 shaving soaps so far, mostly standard wet shave soaps found on Amazon. Arko was the cheapest of all bit oddly the slickest and only one that&#x27;s tallow based at this price point.</li>
    <li> I have used ARKO for about two months. I like the fragrance and the soap lathers up on my brush easily. The soap makes my face slick and allows my razor to glide easily. My skin is left feeling cool and smelling fresh. My girlfriend likes it. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
    <li> After trying about ten different soaps that didn&#x27;t lather easily, I finally ended up with this one...it&#x27;s crazy good lather. The scent isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I love this soap! Great scent,lathers well, one of my favorites,I will have 5 pucks total soon! I may buy more of them as I weed out some of my others that I seldom use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who fall into the &amp;#34;don&#x27;t like the smell&amp;#34; category..other than that it seems OK. I&#x27;ll stick with the Proraso line or try Cella or listen to my barber who loves Barbasol.</li>
    <li> This will make a great travel shaving soap. The top screws on so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it opening in my luggage. It&#x27;s under 3 oz. so no problem at the airport.  It lathers up nice and quickly with a Bore brush, but even better with a Badger brush. It has a very nice fragrance and gives a clean,  close and smooth  shave. It leaves a nice smell after shaving. This soap, along with my Parker A1R travel DE razor and Edwin Jagger Travel brush  has ended one problem when packing for a long motorcycle trip.</li>
    <li> Soap is a quick lathering, ostensibly tallow-based product. The smell is kind-of soapy, with a hint of floral or citrus, but hard to identify. Wished that its scent was more like the lemon kolnyasi famous in Turkey.The lather provides a good cushion while shaving using a double-edged razor.</li>
    <li> All personal reasons but dig the smell and feel!  Reminds me of growing up!  My go to cream</li>
    <li> Smells like a real barber shop right at your very own sink.  Works really well, seems to have good moisturizing ability and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.  Definitely has a smell, but it&#x27;s a good clean smell and not too strong once you rinse your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self-contained bowl makes it ideal for traveling, and I&#x27;ll probably buy a few more just to have one in my luggage.</li>
    <li> Lathers very well, but the scent just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> This has become my everyday shaving soap. It lathers well and provides good protection while shaving. It smells much like Ivory bath soap. Which is fine with me. You can find better prices for this soap on eBay.</li>
    <li> New to this DE shave with brush etc, and have become addicted. Only 4 stars because I have little to compare to. It gives great shave and I really like the clean smell. Soak brush in cup with hot water for approx. 5 mins to make good foam/coverage. Will update later after trying other stuff. Great price!</li>
    <li> This lathers better then Williams mug soap and is much slicker, a great value.</li>
    <li> Excellent lather, but I could not get past the scent.  Like urinal cakes.  Threw it out after one shave.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with this shaving soap. It lathers well, has a pleasant smell, and works better than similarly priced soaps. The container is robust enough to withstand normal travel, if you pack sensibly. I will certainly buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key to my rating system (extrapolate for music and movies): * &#x3D; Terrible. Unusable. Fiction so bad it&#x27;s not even laughable.  ** &#x3D; Substandard. Partially usable with modification, or with lowered expectations. Fiction is laughable.  *** &#x3D; Usable, but won&#x27;t purchase again. Wouldn&#x27;t read fiction by this author again, unless stuck in an airport for 12 hours with nothing else to read.  **** &#x3D; Meets my expectations. Will buy again unless I find a better product. Will read this author again. ***** &#x3D; Exceeds my expectations. Will buy author&#x27;s work automatically.</li>
    <li> He is new to wet shaving....it has a nice clean soapy smell.</li>
    <li> Lathers up quickly and seems to lubricate well. Took a few shaves to get used to the scent, but wife and daughter both have commented on the scent being soft.</li>
    <li> Excellent soap. I&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> Good starter soap to try out</li>
    <li> I like the Arko products.  The scent is a combination of Ivory soap with just a puff of citrus and baby powder.&lt;br /&gt;The lubrication is excellent and provides a very smooth shave.  My only criticism is it tends to leave the&lt;br /&gt;face a bit dry and tight.  That is easily fixed with a dab of moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you get 90% of the quality of some of the top shelf products but at 10-20% of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An excellent value!  I&#x27;ll keep using and purchasing this product as one of my favorites.</li>
    <li> Smells good....just like soap!  Makes a good lather! I like the product and intend to buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Impeccable product. I don&#x27;t need to get wordy about it. This is just quality soap that moisturizes and lubricates well. End of story.</li>
    <li> Decided to spend $5 on this soap and give it a try. It&#x27;s OK but nothing remarkable. The soap has a pleasant aroma to it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the soap smell the first time I used it but it has grown on me. It has a very &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell as opposed to a perfume-y smell and I had to get used to it.  As for its shaveability, this is slick as ice on your skin and really lubricates a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it exclusively for travel, which is at least two overnights a week.  The case it comes in makes it perfect for this and a whole lot more practical than my mug and brush.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.</li>
    <li> Arko Shave Soap is my favorite. It smells and works great. Makes me enjoy shaving again.</li>
    <li> good product. works well. great price.</li>
    <li> Big time strong soap scent. Leathers easily and allows for a good smooth shave. Excellent cost value. But, if you are looking for a sweet smelling soap, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shaving sop that not only smelled manly but worked as well. The soap goes on rich and not to thick, but provides the prefect shave... and I have found the soap of my dreams.Add to that a great case as well. I spent some time in Mexico and this was the best way to go.. I am an ARKO man!!</li>
    <li> smells just like a freshly cleaned porta-can</li>
    <li> Instant rich lather for a great price....some dislike the strong scent but I find it quite refreshing and very similar to Irish Spring soap....the bowl is very handy for travel.</li>
    <li> Ideal for travel, this is Arko shaving soap the same as in the Arko shave sticks, in a case that screws shut and can be stashed in a carry on ready to go. I bought this because I recently traveled through London Heathrow and was stopped for not having the Colonel Conk travel shave soap placed in a 311 plastic bag. This was a pain since one of the benefits of traveling with shave soap is precisely that soap is a solid not a liquid or gel and so can go in carry on luggage without taking up room in a 311 bag. Colonel Conk&#x27;s is a transparent glycerin soap that may be confused with gel and apparently was when I was stopped. Arko is quite plainly soap and looks that way. There should be no more problems. The usual comments on Arko apply: thick, creamy lather, pleasant lemony smell, which unlike some reviewers I do not find to be over done. The shave sticks can be bought in bulk incredibly cheaply here on Amazon and for a long time I used those exclusively (now using Tabac and Pro Raso alongside Arko), but this will be my go to soap for travel. A good deal at the price.</li>
    <li> Very easy to lather, good protection and slickness.  I think the scent is clean and classic and IMHO should be in every den.</li>
    <li> great stuff lather is rich, to add a even better shave add a dab of kiss your face and a few drops of olive oil, best shave ever!</li>
    <li> This is a good soap. It lathers very well. It has a good and slick cushion to it as well. If you need a budget priced shaving soap, this is a great option. The scent is a bit strong for some, but I find it will air out if you leave the lid off for a bit. Doesn&#x27;t bother me though....this is one of my go to soaps.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shave soap on the market and I have tried them all for wet shaving. I am addicted to the nice clean smell too!</li>
    <li> I love the light, fresh scent &amp; hubby loves how well it works for him!</li>
    <li> What they say about Arko is true. It&#x27;s a wonderful performer with a pretty awful smell. I&#x27;ve heard some people say it smells like a urinal cake/puck. The scent is very similar to Irish Spring soap but it&#x27;s just a little more concentrated which can be a little off putting. But for the price, the performance is so good that I say deal with the scent.</li>
    <li> I like the fresh citrus like smell, it lathers pretty fast and it feel refreshing.</li>
    <li> If you have used an Arko Shaving Stick and liked it, you will definitely like this product.  Although the scent is polarizing for some (it smells like soap to me)  it lathers up a storm with minimal effort.  When this container is getting close to being empty I will order another one.</li>
    <li> Easy to lather.  Going to use it for travel.  Smells like citronella to me,m so I&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;ll get double duty out of it as a mosquito repellant when I travel to SE Asia.</li>
