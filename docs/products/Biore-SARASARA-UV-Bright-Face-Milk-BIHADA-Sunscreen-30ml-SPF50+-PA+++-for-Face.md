      <li>I love the consistency of this.</li>

      <li>surely will order again and use this product till the rest of my life.</li>
      <li>and this is my favorite sunscreen for the summer.</li>
      <li>Love this sunscreen so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you do that, you gonna love it.</li>
      <li>So make sure not to use this on your face unless you&#x27;re going to put on a moisturizer beforehand...</li>
      <li>My My make-up looks perfect all day long.</li>
      <li>She loved it and highly recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The best sunscreen I have ever used, hands down.  </li>
      <li>This leaves a very smooth layer on your skin, making it look very radiant and healthy.  </li>
      <li>makes me feel secure to be outdoors.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves no trace of oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is silky smooth and it feels like a liquid powder, if you can imagine what that feels like.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
      <li>I am very please :)</li>
      <li>; is an accurate description, as the product has the color and consistency of milk or dairy cream - very liquid and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and spreads evenly.</li>
      <li>This is an amazing product, which I recommend for people like me, who dislike the oily, greasy feeling of regular drugstore sunscreen and SPF lotions.</li>
      <li>That might be the only downside, honestly.  </li>
      <li>This would be more appropriate for oily and normal skin, if you have dry skin I would suggest the Aqua Rich.</li>
      <li>And does the job just right.</li>
      <li>My skin looks slightly pink and really feels good.  </li>
      <li>A quarter sized amount in the palm of my hand more than covers my face, my neck, and the back of my hands</li>
      <li>So much better than our greasy, smelly American sunscreens.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll come back to this product during the summer and see if I&#x27;ll like it more.</li>
      <li>Also, this product needs double cleansing (oil make up remover+ your favorite face soup), otherwise, it causes acne.</li>
      <li>the pro&#x27;s of this is that it absorbs quickly and is not greasy,which is good for oily skin or hot and humid climates,i tried the other biore sunscreen in the blue bottle,biore watery</li>
      <li>It is light as a feather, shake before applying, and does not leave the dreaded white cast on the face and décolleté area!  </li>
      <li>i think its called,now that one is very good,no colour and non greasy</li>
      <li>I never had this issue before with a sunscreen or any product considering my skin is very oily even during the winter.</li>
      <li>It has alcohol in the formula, and you really feel the alcohol.</li>
      <li>I assume it&#x27;s because of the high alcohol content.</li>
      <li>Skin feels so soft!!</li>
      <li>,i think this sarasara would work for people who have light skin tones with pink undertones,it dint work for me.</li>
      <li>I just bought an extra moisturizer to wear with it which has turned out for the better in the long run.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have oily combo skin, and this made my skin super dry.</li>
      <li>I like that as it makes me feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed immediately, but it&#x27;s definitely different than other brands.  </li>
      <li>Again, I really like that, as it&#x27;s not at all greasy, but it&#x27;s different than other brands and may be new to you.  </li>
      <li>I felt barely any stinging on my skin with this.</li>
      <li>, Radiant Effect Provides SPF 50+/PA+++ UV protection, and also an ideal for make up base.</li>
      <li>I leave it as a make up base, but i&#x27;m not much of a foundation wearer anyways, so this is perfect to just put on by itself.</li>
      <li>But if your skin is really sensitive or dry, this product could make it even drier.</li>
      <li>It leaves it feeling soft and matte (no oily feeling)!&lt;br /&gt;However, it can dry out your face!</li>
      <li>That may just be my skin or the already extremely arid climate I live in.</li>

<li> (I think?), so it&#x27;s more liquidy and is cold when you put it on.  </li>

<li> This sunscreen has a pinkish tint which did not work well for my tan skin,it gave me a weird,shiny grayish pink tint,</li>
<li> It is impossible for me to exaggerate how easily I burn.  </li>
<li> This does not break me out and does not have the greasy feel other sunscreens have.</li>

<li> because of my disease I can feel by stinging in my skin if the sun protection is not strong.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s been tested in some seriously sunny places (summer in Thailand, beaches vacations).  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This does not break me out and does not have the greasy feel other sunscreens have. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Was delivered on time. No hassle.</li>
    <li> I have oily combo skin, and this made my skin super dry. I never had this issue before with a sunscreen or any product considering my skin is very oily even during the winter. It broke me out and I had tons of dry patches. I assume it&#x27;s because of the high alcohol content. I&#x27;ll come back to this product during the summer and see if I&#x27;ll like it more.</li>
    <li> The best sunscreen I have ever used, hands down.  I have skin that loves to burn.  Sometimes, I feel like it finds the one tiny place that was missed by sunscreen and clothes and burns, just to spite me.  It is impossible for me to exaggerate how easily I burn.  Since I started using this sunscreen, I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ve gotten more freckles while out in the sun.  And it&#x27;s been tested in some seriously sunny places (summer in Thailand, beaches vacations).  Trust me when I say this sunscreen isn&#x27;t messing around!  That might be the only downside, honestly.  If you like to tan the rest of yourself and just use this on your face, your face will be paler.  This is perfect for me and my sun-sensitive, cancer-prone skin, but may not be ideal for others.  Love this sunscreen so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things to note: this sunscreen has a little alcohol in it (I think?), so it&#x27;s more liquidy and is cold when you put it on.  I like that as it makes me feel like it&#x27;s being absorbed immediately, but it&#x27;s definitely different than other brands.  Also, once it absorbs your face may feel a little like you just powdered it.  Again, I really like that, as it&#x27;s not at all greasy, but it&#x27;s different than other brands and may be new to you.  One other benefit is that it doesn&#x27;t matter (at least for me) if you put it on over make-up (I know, you should do it under, but sometimes I forget/am re-applying), it works great since it absorbs so easily and doesn&#x27;t require a lot of rubbing in.</li>
    <li> Very nice sunscreen for face... Brightening effect and not oily at all... I am getting a great finish with this product.. So no need to powder... No need to wear makeup...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product for its sunscreen effect but I was extremely happy to find out that it prevents my skin from being oily as well. My My make-up looks perfect all day long. But if your skin is really sensitive or dry, this product could make it even drier.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing! Non-greasy, no odor, no white cast look! It absorbs quickly and spreads evenly. I do not use this sparingly and it still seems to be lasting me a long time. A quarter sized amount in the palm of my hand more than covers my face, my neck, and the back of my hands (don&#x27;t forget about the back of your hands, people!). It definitely drys me out a little, though. That may just be my skin or the already extremely arid climate I live in. I just bought an extra moisturizer to wear with it which has turned out for the better in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not recommend this enough. So much better than our greasy, smelly American sunscreens.</li>
    <li> I have a skin disease and always need the best sun protection products. This one is odorless, colorless, and non greasy. it feels like primer. Amazing. And does the job just right. because of my disease I can feel by stinging in my skin if the sun protection is not strong. I felt barely any stinging on my skin with this. A perfect veil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different types of sun screen from cheap to expensive but all of them were very sticky and it always left a heavy and sticky feeling on my skin. My skin looked always shiny and tended to burst out to pimples and acnes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to know this product when one of my friends went to Thailand and just casually bought one little bottle for her trip there. She loved it and highly recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cant express how glad I am to have found this sun creen. This leaves a very smooth layer on your skin, making it look very radiant and healthy.  It doesnt make my skin look so oily or shiny anymore. I&#x27;M ABSOLUTELY HAPPY about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This is my regiem: In the morning, I wash my face and rinse with warm water. After that, I put the SK essence water on and the final step is putting this sun screen on). If you skin is dry, you can out a layer of serum and then apply this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I surely will order again and use this product till the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used. The SPF 50+ protection is truly effective. You can trust that it will keep your face from tanning, even when you have to spend long hours under the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is silky smooth and it feels like a liquid powder, if you can imagine what that feels like. It goes on smoothly and leaves no trace of oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Japanese Biore sunscreens for years and do not plan to change brands anytime soon.</li>
    <li> I will never use another sunscreen! I love the consistency of this. It is perfect for my oil skin! Another plus is this small bottle last such a long time! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Try it yourself.  It is a very good product.  My skin looks slightly pink and really feels good.  Good under makeup too.</li>
    <li> This would be more appropriate for oily and normal skin, if you have dry skin I would suggest the Aqua Rich. The texture is sooo nice and doesnt feel like you&#x27;re wearing anything. No white cast or funky sunscreen smells.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this is my favorite sunscreen for the summer. I have skin hiperpigmentation problems and this product makes me feel secure to be outdoors. It has alcohol in the formula, and you really feel the alcohol. But it&#x27;s not a problem for me , just put a good moisturizer before using it. Also, this product needs double cleansing (oil make up remover+ your favorite face soup), otherwise, it causes acne. If you do that, you gonna love it. Very good for oily skin too.</li>
    <li> Works so well under MU, or alone. Great product</li>
    <li> lightweight UV block for face and good oil control.( very good for summer ^_^), Radiant Effect Provides SPF 50+/PA+++ UV protection, and also an ideal for make up base. it&#x27;s contains fine light correction powder to cover pores, The Best of all Skin look dullness &amp; Brighten tone give you that radiant look all day!</li>
    <li> Skin feels so soft!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s really small, but I only use a little product when applying the product to my face. It works well!</li>
    <li> I like how this felt on my skin. It was not greasy at all!!! I leave it as a make up base, but i&#x27;m not much of a foundation wearer anyways, so this is perfect to just put on by itself. I am very please :)</li>
    <li> This sunscreen has a pinkish tint which did not work well for my tan skin,it gave me a weird,shiny grayish pink tint,the pro&#x27;s of this is that it absorbs quickly and is not greasy,which is good for oily skin or hot and humid climates,i tried the other biore sunscreen in the blue bottle,biore watery i think its called,now that one is very good,no colour and non greasy,i think this sarasara would work for people who have light skin tones with pink undertones,it dint work for me.</li>
    <li> It finally arrived today, earlier than anticipated !  It is light as a feather, shake before applying, and does not leave the dreaded white cast on the face and décolleté area!  The only piece of advice I would give If you are over 40 and have combo skin, moisturize your drier areas well, because once this is on, it is on , it dries down!</li>
    <li> I rate 5 stars for this item...&lt;br /&gt;Its nice to use and non sticky at all after apply it, just like a powder.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and nice seller...</li>
    <li> Really nice on your skin. It leaves it feeling soft and matte (no oily feeling)!&lt;br /&gt;However, it can dry out your face! So make sure not to use this on your face unless you&#x27;re going to put on a moisturizer beforehand...</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, which I recommend for people like me, who dislike the oily, greasy feeling of regular drugstore sunscreen and SPF lotions. &amp;#34;Face Milk&amp;#34; is an accurate description, as the product has the color and consistency of milk or dairy cream - very liquid and easy to apply.  A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat i have is that I&#x27;m not sure if this irritates sensitive or very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is the best sunscreen I have used in my life. If only they sold it at Ulta stores.</li>
    <li> incredibly greasy and yet totally full of alcohol/astringent.  broke my face out badly.  will not purchase again.</li>
