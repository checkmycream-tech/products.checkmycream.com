<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to wear this fragrance years ago, around the 90&#x27;s.  It is still a strong contender!! It is soft but very comanding!! It is a great winter or summer fragrance.  If you put too much on...it may overwhelm you, just a small spritz or two is great.  Very soft, yet sexy..I love it...</li>
    <li> Perfect! Arrived on time and my wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!  This was a great price too. Department stores are not carrying it anymore,  so this was a find.</li>
    <li> Great prices love it but don&#x27;t put to much on a little goes on just right&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great scent worth the money</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law&#x27;s favorite scent. She&#x27;s so glad she&#x27;s still able to buy it.</li>
    <li> A deluted version of the original!!</li>
    <li> Timely delivery. Perfect product</li>
    <li> Love the light fragrance.  Always get compliments when I wear this.</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife, she loves it and so do I</li>
    <li> Smell is off. Smells like lemon and alcohol</li>
    <li> I love wearing this perfume in the spring and summer. Refreshing! It&#x27;s scent reminds one of just getting out of the shower.</li>
    <li> Product arrived as expected in good shape and as advertised. I would purchase from them again.</li>
    <li> Love it! Light, feminine, elegant. To me it smells like Lilly of the valley. Nice looking bottle. Amazingly inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Spray perfume -always get a compliment  on the pleasant odor.  Easy on the sinus, never hurts or sneeze.  Especially like to spray by bed lines with it.</li>
    <li> Has a really nice smell, the wife loves it.</li>
    <li> I always get compliments when I wear JessicaMcClintock. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> Loved the products and the price. :)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and I can&#x27;t find it in my small town. Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> This  fragrance is  wonderful &amp;  floral. It reminds me of  fresh lilacs or hyacinths.  When I wear it , people say  I  smell so  wonderful.  Really  pretty.</li>
    <li> Wonderful pleasant perfume that I use and bought for my daughter as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> wife loves it! I drove to all the major retail stores for Christmas and no one carries it anymore. Found it on Amazon and she is thrilled. Know where to get it in the future. Thanks......</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this for years and it never gets tired!</li>
    <li> My order was delivered on time, very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Wonderful no quickly delivered</li>
    <li> I love Jessica Mcclintock parfum but this smells wrong. Perhaps they sent me an old bottle that has gone bad.</li>
    <li> Awesome my wife and I love it!</li>
    <li> Very weak aroma. Not at all like the real thing. The very clear color indicated to us it was probably a diluted version. She tried wearing it twice and we both agreed it was not the genuine article. Packaging was great. What was in the package was not.</li>
    <li> I have never had so many compliments on  a scent as this one. Light flowery and not too overpowering. People always ask me if I am wearing Lily of the Valley... I don&#x27;t know what that is but everyone seems to like it.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jessica since the late 80&#x27;s or early 90&#x27;s/ Fresh but not overpowering or heavu/</li>
    <li> Love the light scent!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted At an excellent price.</li>
    <li> I love it.  I love Poppy Blossom more, but it&#x27;s 3 times more expensive!  My mom will not wear anything but this Jessica McClintock. It&#x27;s really awesome for the price. Buy from Amazon to insure you don&#x27;t get a fake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Eau De Parfum Spray for many, many years.  Long lasting throughout the day. I will not leave the house without a quick spray.  I consider this my signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this. Super price. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Delightful fragrance of flowers. My daughter and I love it. It smells so fresh and sweet. Same good product we love.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like I remembered it...</li>
    <li> Arrived on time &amp; in pristine condition. This is my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume because scent last long but not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Always loved this smell and lasts all day</li>
    <li> I finally found the PERFECT perfume! Smells so clean with a hint of floral that lingers and gets many compliments!</li>
    <li> It is one of the best and effective aroma I have ever worn.  Constant compliments from people walking past and they turn around and ask me what am I wearing. They say it smells so wonderful,light, flowery but in no way does it smell harsh.  It&#x27;s a wonderful compliment.  I have been wearing this fragrance at 15 years</li>
    <li> ♥Love this perfume.Its one of my top shelf.Just like the lotion it last alday and you dont have to reapply at all, meaning you save money.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried them yet but always a nice fragrance. Great price!</li>
    <li> I would never take the points away from the product.  I love it. I have used it for years.  It has a fresh and mild floral fragrance to it. And I do get many compliments when wearing it.  This was the first time I ever purchased it online, and  I was concerned that it wasn&#x27;t !00% as fresh as it could have been.  I did appreciate the online price.</li>
    <li> Gift for my mom.  She LOVES the smell-fresh and light.</li>
    <li> I gave this perfume to my wife as a gift and she loved it.  The spray was just as good as the type bought in an expensive store at $ 80.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly I would purchase it again at this reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I purchased Jessica Mcclintock Eau de Parfum Spray for my wife and she still loves it. She has tried several different perfumes over the years but Jessica is still her favorite and I like it best on her by far. Got this product at a great price at amazon, who else?</li>
    <li> My wife only wears this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely scent. I was concerned because the price was so good, but this is the spray I&#x27;ve been using just in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Gift for my best girl. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with the Parfum.....it is a lighter fragrant which lets me believe this is not the original parfum.  I know because I have been using this brand for Years!! I will NOT order again!  Shame on Amazon for selling this........</li>
    <li> I  love it!  It smells the same as the gift I received from Macy&#x27;s!  Lilly of the Valley smells so good! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Awesome fragrance, great service.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s light and sweet, like early spring flowers.  I get compliments nearly every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for years and really like it.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes floral scents.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my mom. She&#x27;s been wearing this scent for 15-20 years when my brother and I originally picked it out for her as a gift when we were little! She still always gets compliments and hasnt changed it since! The parfum was perfectly packaged and in excellent condition at delivery. Came very fast.</li>
    <li> Love everything about this! The price, is great!&lt;br /&gt; The scent is so clean and fresh, without being over powering. Like a breath of spring!&lt;br /&gt;it does smell a little strong when first sprayed, but that quickly fades to a long lasting soft scent that I HAV</li>
    <li> Love it.  I have used Jessica McClintock for so many years it has become m y signature.  So many compliments to count.</li>
    <li> Great price and delivery!</li>
    <li> My very favorite cologne so I bet it will soon no longer be offered, but so nice to find it at a more reasonable price than in department stores</li>
    <li> This is my favorite, I cannot seem to get away from it.  Noathing compares to the Fresh, Clean smell I hae used it for  wow 15-20 years.  I want to find my bar soap is it still available?</li>
    <li> Excellent, swift service!</li>
    <li> Mcclintock is a very lovely scent for any woman who loves to smell fresh and stay smelling for fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for your special lady</li>
    <li> I received it on time. Great price for the amount of product. Every where I was looking at wanted more for the 1.7oz. Bottle then what they are selling this 3.4 oz. Bottle</li>
    <li> Most times this smells like it should and I love it.  I did get one a few months back that just didn&#x27;t smell right and I only used part of it as I thought maybe it was my sense of smell.  The next time I get a bad bottle I will return it.  The last two bottles were great and I get told all the time how good I smell and what am I using for perfume.</li>
    <li> This review isn&#x27;t for the product as it is one both my wife and I agree is ideally suited for her. This reviews the buying process. We found the price considerably better than anywhere else and the prompt response as good or better than the price. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jessica Mcclintock for a looong years. I&#x27;ve never change my mind to use any other perfume since then. I love the scent sweetness smells of fresh flowery.</li>
    <li> The perfume looked new but the bottle did not have the plastic wrap on the outside, which made me wonder if it was really authentic as it claimed to be.</li>
    <li> Wore this for several years, first bottle I ever bought that very little scent to it. I threw it away and went to ebay to purchase one. Very disappointed in this product from you!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne. I plan on buying more. Its less expensive to order it this way then to purchase at the store.</li>
    <li> There is no way that the product we received is original. We still had some original left and it smells much stronger.This product is gone within 30 minutes. Somehow I didn&#x27;t believe the negative reviews because I couldn&#x27;t believe that Amazon is selling fake products but now I know better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: I also tried to return the item but wasn&#x27;t able to. Amazon gives the following error: \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Basically you cannot return the item and your money is wasted.</li>
    <li> If I paid $4.99 for 3-5 day shipping and handling. Then that&#x27;s when I expect to receive my product. This is a gift for my moms birthday (which is tomorrow) and I order this a little over a week ago and its still not here!</li>
    <li> I am stunned at the quality of the perfume!  It is new, fresh, lacks any &amp;#34;aged alcoholing&amp;#34; bitter smell.  It is exactly the way Jessica McClintock is supposed to smell.  It was a brilliant surprise to get such quality, I haven&#x27;t even found a bottle this fresh in stores for a year!  Thank you for the perfect perfume delivery.</li>
    <li> This is one of the most delightful fragrances you will find.  I spritz in the morning and it can be detected at the end if the day.  It is so light and pleasant, no heavy notes or perfumy scents.  I have used this for years and it is just as fresh now as it was fifteen years ago.</li>
    <li> stacy my love scent......its my fav</li>
    <li> Very strong but fragrant lily of the valley scent.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments since wearing this one. Great summer scent.  Packaged very well and arrived quickly.</li>

    <li> my favorite cologne I hope its not true it may be discontinued great bargain</li>
    <li> Love this and was glad to find it online.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> my wife loves this stuff. and it is cheaper than Chanel  smells good and is not over powering. I don&#x27;t  like it when she sprays it in a confined  space. but that just me right..</li>
    <li> Seemed a little watery and weak not as strong as the bottles you buy at retailers. Cost was great though.</li>
    <li> Always enjoy my favorite parfum  spray and receive many compliments</li>
    <li> AWESOME FRAGRANCE !!!!!  This perfume is incredible !!  It&#x27;s not sold in department stores anymore.....so I was elated to find it on Amazon.com !!!  The body lotion and body wash is also available on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has a light scent and everybody always compliments me. It was shipped to me on time. I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Excellent, exactly as ordered...</li>
    <li> love this scent, just perfect!</li>
    <li> This item arrived in the time that it was noted it would come.  It was packaged pretty well.  I was satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Price is half the store price. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Smells a little off. Is this possibly a fake?</li>
    <li> Great! My mom loved it so much, she asked me to buy 3 more!</li>
    <li> Loved the fragrance.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> am well pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Love the perfume and the price, not to mention fast shipping</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years with no problem.  There appears to be something wrong with what I received.  It did not smell the same at all.  Maybe it is old and has lost its potency.  I am very pleased that I was reimbursed.  I love Amazon&#x27;s customer service polices!</li>
    <li> The only perfume I use !!! Love it</li>
    <li> Best fragrance out there.  Smells like spring.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my service expectations!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was expecting!</li>
    <li> This is NOT the real perfume.....I have worn this almost daily since 1991 and as soon as I sprayed it, I could tell the fragrance was off. This was a gift from my husband for Christmas. The distributor is from Virtue Development Company, not the true Jessica McClintock in San Fran., CA. This is a cheap IMITATION of the true perfume...the smell, the name of dist. on back of box and the bottom of the bottle confirm the imitation....Nice try there Virtue!!</li>
    <li> The cap was broken and about 1/8&amp;#34; had leaked out.  Plus the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as other bottles have.</li>
    <li> All goo - professionally wrapped and appropriate fior a gift.</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for years.  I love the floral scent and the bottle I ordered is the larger size at such a great price!</li>
    <li> Jessica Mcclintock is my favorite cologne!  I was happy to find it for a lower price than I have been able to get it for a lower  price than retail.  I wear it every day.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and to find it at this price was wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a light, floral perfume.  I have received many compliments when I wear it.  It has become my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Best statement perfume ever made!</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product from other companies and sometimes it has arrived with some product leaking out or just a shortage or the product.  When I received my perfume  Jessica McClintock from Amazon it came in perfect condition.  I love this perfume and I have got so many comments on how It smells so good.</li>
    <li> So happy to find my perfume, don&#x27;t know why it is no longer in the stores where I bought it for years??</li>
    <li> Great scent&lt;br /&gt;Packaged perfectly</li>
    <li> Very pleased . Made a nice. Christmas gift</li>
    <li> Did not like it, wrong version of fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for many years and I still get so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;People are always asking me about my perfume.</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for over 25 years and continue to be asked by strangers what is that fragrance as they love it.</li>
    <li> Light and clean! I love this scent</li>
    <li> My purchase arrived in a timely fashion and in good shape. I was afraid this item would be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; version of the genuine version. However, it appears to be the real thing.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping !!! It&#x27;s my favorite perfume and it&#x27;s so expensive in the stores. Was so lucky to find it online. Gotta love it,not having to leave your house and still get the best price and it gets dropped right on your door step within 2 days!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!!&#x27;n</li>
    <li> Perfect. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! It stays on long and has a soft floral smell. I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> When I received the perfume it was not wrapped, as it should be.  The fragrance was not like the store bought Jessica Mcclintock.  To me it could have been a knock-off.  I returned it immediately.</li>
    <li> love my Jessica Mcclintock great size for the price. This is a keeper will be replacing once i get low</li>
    <li> this is my signature scent.i get compliments on it.it is the one scent that is a must have for me.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this for years.  Often hard to find and the price was fantastic.  I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my mother(94). She said it was no longer available in the store where she shops.It came right on time and she is happy so I am too.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> It is a delicious scent and very smooth.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a weaker scent than when previously purchased several years ago. Maybe my sense of smell is fading.</li>
    <li> Nice perfume.  Bought as a gift for mom as her local department store quit carrying it.  Fast shipping and a great value.</li>
    <li> Awesome perfume at an awesome price! It is light and flowery and not at all overpowering. Have gotten MANY compliments on it.</li>
    <li> This was a cheap replica! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Ah! Juicy white flowers.  Well if you know what Lilly of the valley is.  This smells like a fresh bouquet of lily of the valley.  Just beautiful.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you like true soft floral notes.</li>
    <li> I have used it for years.  I would never change, I just love it.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites....been using for years...I get a lot of compliments with this fragrance (light, beautiful scent :)</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over 30 years love it.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance at the right price.</li>
    <li> Price went up since I brought it but my mom loves it !</li>
    <li> I am not certain that this is legitimately Jessica McClintock.  If it is, the strength is very weak as opposed to the bottles I buy at major department stores. The color is also much lighter.  I have been having trouble finding it where I normally buy it and thought maybe this was a closeout price. I cannot wear many fragrances because of asthma and this is one scent that is light and does not bother me.  I usually get many compliments on the way it smells.  I have not gotten any since I bought these two bottles.  It smells like the real fragrance, but is not as strong, nor does it last as long as my other.always did.  I am very disappointed.  I did not think with Amazon, I would have to worry about this kind of thing.  I felt like they would only sell legitimate products.  I did not read the other reviews until after I had already purchased product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite! totally love it I have purchased about 3 bottles of it, You can wear it in any season!</li>
    <li> I just love this parfum and I got it  very fast!</li>
    <li> I adore this colongne, it is been my fav for over 25 years!! It is gardenias and lemon essense and I recieve dozens of compliments from males of all ages when I am out in public, groc. strore or other... I will buy this colongne forever. S.</li>
    <li> I have many different kind,s by her but I like EAU DE the BEST. I,ve had so many people ask what kind of PARFUM do I have on they say it smell,s so good. I Just LOVE it.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mother, she loved it</li>
    <li> My favorite for many years.</li>
    <li> My mother&#x27;s fav scent, at a great price.</li>
    <li> My all time fave fragrance. It is timeless and classic. Smells identical to honeysuckles gently blowing in the wind on a warm summer day. Wear this and I guarantee people will randomly stop to ask you what your wearing and tell you how good you smell. ........especially men. Drives them WILD !!</li>
    <li> Have used for years. Reacts well to my body chemistry.  I could not find a better price anywhere.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and so does everybody else.  I put it on in the early morning before I leave for work and by the end of the day people are still asking who smells so good.  I tell them its me.  I get alot of compliments on the unique smell which I love and have worn this scent many years.</li>
    <li> This was a Mother&#x27;s Day gift. As Mom had specifically mentioned that she was almost out of her favorite Jessica McClintock scent, she was very happy with the gift.</li>
    <li> Great to find my favorite perfume once again and at such a deeply discounted price!</li>
