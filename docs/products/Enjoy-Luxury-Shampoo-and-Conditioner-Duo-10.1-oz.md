      <li>Guess there&#x27;s a reason they named this line ENJOY!</li>
      <li>I immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had more people comment on the smell of my hair after using the Luxury Enjoy</li>
      <li>Staff recommended Enjoy, and I&#x27;m glad they did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy to have found it a little cheaper.  </li>
      <li>So i invested in a huge salon sized bottles of the shampoo and conditioner.     </li>
      <li>So i discontinued use after about a month and was stuck with huge bottles of shampoo and conditioner.     </li>
      <li>By lightly curly</li>
      <li>Leaves hair so soft,and silky,and tangle free.  </li>
      <li>I notice an improvement in the condition of my hair--more smooth.</li>
      <li>These &#x27;Enjoy&#x27; selections&lt;br /&gt;helped</li>
      <li>Try the travel size, you&#x27;ll be back to buy more... amazing smell, yet not over powering...</li>
      <li>So I bought the Enjoy shampoo &amp; conditioner and noticed after first use that my hair is not frizzy anymore!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;d probably work better on somebody who has very brittle, damaged, or chemically processed hair.</li>
      <li>Didnt buy on Amazon but love it so much I had to review it anyway.</li>
      <li>The company that send the product did so quickly.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that Enjoy products are a bit more pricey than what you would find at the drugstore, but the extra investment will be well worth it if you truly care about your hair.</li>
      <li>I have tried almost everything out there including Alterna, Chemistry, L&#x27;Oreal (the new shiny bottle that smells like ben gay), Pureology has a medicine smell as well</li>
      <li>this shampoo is truly luxury.has great coconut smell,very thick in texture</li>
      <li>I actually won the shampoo and conditioner at my hairdresser&#x27;s grand opening.  </li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re all sulfate free) and my intention is to give you a general idea of the journey.    </li>
      <li>I loved it at first, my hair was soft and there was definitely less breakage.  </li>
      <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think this shampoo and conditioner made a difference, but after using it for weeks, then trying herbal essences again for one hair wash, I noticed my hair feels drastically different using ENjoy products.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so soft and voluminous and it was super shiny.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser recommended I use this shampoo because it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>Maybe I was using too much conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
      <li>My hair is still very soft, smooth, shiny and most importantly not frizzy!</li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of other products out there (too many to list</li>
      <li>I have fine hair rods, medium length, and live in the hot dry mountain area of California...</li>
      <li>I use the conditioner only for one day and the next time, I use a fair amount of the conditioner with just a drop of the shampoo (yes, this bottle will last forever!).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d give something new a try.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try a new brand.</li>
      <li>The end result is soft manageable hair for years now!</li>
      <li>It makes my hair REALLY soft!</li>
      <li>Enjoy seems to have won me over hands down.</li>
      <li>Plus it lasts so much longer because you only have to use about the size of a nickle.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo gave me very itchy dandruff and dermatitis around my hairline after only 3-4 days of use.</li>
      <li>Great stuff, the shape of the bottle and the color of the bottle are a little weird, but other than that I love it.</li>
      <li>These are quality products that don&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, and they leave your hair feeling clean, hydrated and shiny.</li>
      <li>so you dont have to use much even on really long hair!</li>
      <li>My hair is dry, but not so dry that i need a super hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this to find a less expensive alternative to Pureology that will leave my hair healthy and manageable.  </li>
      <li>I have normal to dry wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Also it is super concentrated, so you need a little and it lasts a long time.</li>

<li> I have normal to dry wavy hair.  </li>
<li> Also it is super concentrated, so you need a little and it lasts a long time.</li>
<li> I do use a small amount of Argonne Oil after a light towel dry on my wet hair before drying.</li>
<li> For the past few months I have been trying all sorts of different sulfate free shampoo, conditioner and stylers on my hair.</li>
<li> the put a small amount in my hands and rub them together, through the fingers and palms, bend your head forward and apply through the ends and gently fingertip rub the scalp.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s highly concentrated, so a little goes a LONG way..</li>
<li> but after a week my hair went right back to being greasy, heavy, limp and lifeless.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m guessing these will last a very very long time</li>
<li> I also hardly have to use an of the shampoo or conditioner because its really concentrated.</li>
<li> to restore my hair to its natural sheen and fullness, without harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> I have long color treated hair</li>
<li> After surgery, my hair became&lt;br /&gt;brittle and very dry.</li>
<li> I have very thick hair that has been colored and with these products my hair feels incredibly soft.  </li>
<li> Both the shampoo &amp; conditioner are very thick, concentrated so just a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
<li> It hydrates my hair and after I straightened it the other day I noticed I didn&#x27;t need to add anything else to my hair to *tame* it.</li>
<li> I wash and straighten my hair every other day and my hair goes limp after just a few hours into my day.</li>
<li> After using this for about a month, My hair was so greasy and heavy.  </li>
<li> It was limp, dull, and lifeless.  </li>
<li> My hair is past my shoulders.and color treated.  </li>
<li> I usually use organic products, but when I do splurg, this is it.</li>
<li> I have very thin, blonde hair, and this product gives me volume and shine that is unbelievable.  </li>
<li> This shampoo was not suitable for my hair type.  </li>
<li> I mean the front of my hair will curl after it&#x27;s been washed, the rest of my hair does whatever it does</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very expensive, however you actually get what you pay for!  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, they do not sell it in reno, nv, but I can order online through amazon for less than ordering elsewhere.</li>
<li> I was convinced they had some secret product they were using</li>
<li> My hair dries into a hideous style I don&#x27;t like but that&#x27;s just my hair annoying me.  </li>

    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I have very thin, blonde hair, and this product gives me volume and shine that is unbelievable.  Unfortunately, they do not sell it in reno, nv, but I can order online through amazon for less than ordering elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over the last five years. My beautician had suggested doing away with shampoo and use only conditioner as there were enough cleansing solutions in conditioner.  It took about a year to get to this point as I was using shampoo about every five days to lift the hair. Maybe I was using too much conditioner.  I have now found my perfect combination of use. I use the conditioner only for one day and the next time, I use a fair amount of the conditioner with just a drop of the shampoo (yes, this bottle will last forever!).  I mix the combination together in my hands before applying to my hair and massage my scalp as I cleanse. I do use a small amount of Argonne Oil after a light towel dry on my wet hair before drying. To apply the Argonne Oil, I find it best the put a small amount in my hands and rub them together, through the fingers and palms, bend your head forward and apply through the ends and gently fingertip rub the scalp.  The end result is soft manageable hair for years now!</li>
    <li> I actually won the shampoo and conditioner at my hairdresser&#x27;s grand opening.  Wow, it is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very thick hair that has been colored and with these products my hair feels incredibly soft.  I use the conditioner on my skin as well as my hair.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing.  Great stuff, the shape of the bottle and the color of the bottle are a little weird, but other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> For the past few months I have been trying all sorts of different sulfate free shampoo, conditioner and stylers on my hair. I have tried almost everything out there including Alterna, Chemistry, L&#x27;Oreal (the new shiny bottle that smells like ben gay), Pureology has a medicine smell as well and I didn&#x27;t bother purchasing it for that reason. I have tried a lot of other products out there (too many to list but they&#x27;re all sulfate free) and my intention is to give you a general idea of the journey.    I wash and straighten my hair every other day and my hair goes limp after just a few hours into my day. My hair is thin, lightly curly and often frizzes after washing and styling. By lightly curly I mean the front of my hair will curl after it&#x27;s been washed, the rest of my hair does whatever it does but it&#x27;s not straight naturally.     The goal for my hair is to make it stop frizzing, add volume, grow it longer &amp; thicker, make it shiny, smooth and of course smell good.       So I bought the Enjoy shampoo &amp; conditioner and noticed after first use that my hair is not frizzy anymore! My hair dries into a hideous style I don&#x27;t like but that&#x27;s just my hair annoying me.  Enjoy seems to have won me over hands down. It hydrates my hair and after I straightened it the other day I noticed I didn&#x27;t need to add anything else to my hair to *tame* it. The shampoo &amp; conditioner did it all for me! My hair is still very soft, smooth, shiny and most importantly not frizzy! I&#x27;m extremely impressed.    I highly recommend this product. Both the shampoo &amp; conditioner are very thick, concentrated so just a tiny bit goes a long way. I&#x27;m guessing these will last a very very long time and they smell great! Like coconuts! yum yum yum!!!!! My favorite smell.</li>
    <li> This shampoo gave me very itchy dandruff and dermatitis around my hairline after only 3-4 days of use. I stopped using the shampoo, but still use the conditioner. I notice an improvement in the condition of my hair--more smooth. I plan to continue to use the conditioner. I also purchased the Hair Mask and have good results with it as well.</li>
    <li> this shampoo is truly luxury.has great coconut smell,very thick in texture so you dont have to use much even on really long hair!</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t use salon-caliber products on my hair, it starts to look awful. I&#x27;d recently been using Paul Mitchell and Abba products, but when I visited the salon store I thought I&#x27;d give something new a try. Staff recommended Enjoy, and I&#x27;m glad they did. These are quality products that don&#x27;t contain harsh chemicals, and they leave your hair feeling clean, hydrated and shiny. They also smell amazing, which is an added bonus. It&#x27;s true that Enjoy products are a bit more pricey than what you would find at the drugstore, but the extra investment will be well worth it if you truly care about your hair.</li>
    <li> Try the travel size, you&#x27;ll be back to buy more... amazing smell, yet not over powering...I&#x27;ve had more people comment on the smell of my hair after using the Luxury Enjoy, sorta nice... I have fine hair rods, medium length, and live in the hot dry mountain area of California... I usually use organic products, but when I do splurg, this is it. Guess there&#x27;s a reason they named this line ENJOY!</li>
    <li> I have normal to dry wavy hair.  Because my hair is wavy it frizzes a lot.  My hairdresser recommended I use this shampoo because it&#x27;s very moisturizing.  He said it would add moisture and keep my hair from frizzing.  He used it on me at the salon and then styled my hair.  I immediately fell in love with it.  My hair felt so soft and voluminous and it was super shiny.  So i invested in a huge salon sized bottles of the shampoo and conditioner.     After using this for about a month, My hair was so greasy and heavy.  It was limp, dull, and lifeless.  My hairdresser told me to use a \\&quot;detoxifying\\&quot; shampoo to remove buildup.  So i did and it worked but after a week my hair went right back to being greasy, heavy, limp and lifeless.  Then i started to get dandruff.  ugh! So i discontinued use after about a month and was stuck with huge bottles of shampoo and conditioner.     My hair is dry, but not so dry that i need a super hydrating shampoo and conditioner.  This shampoo was not suitable for my hair type.  It&#x27;d probably work better on somebody who has very brittle, damaged, or chemically processed hair.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner is amazing!!  It&#x27;s very expensive, however you actually get what you pay for!  It&#x27;s highly concentrated, so a little goes a LONG way..</li>
    <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this shampoo and conditioner made a difference, but after using it for weeks, then trying herbal essences again for one hair wash, I noticed my hair feels drastically different using ENjoy products. I also hardly have to use an of the shampoo or conditioner because its really concentrated. It makes my hair REALLY soft!</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;Enjoy&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner duo is a great investment. After surgery, my hair became&lt;br /&gt;brittle and very dry. As well, I have always used lots of &#x27;product&#x27; in my hair. These &#x27;Enjoy&#x27; selections&lt;br /&gt;helped to restore my hair to its natural sheen and fullness, without harsh chemicals. I would purchase again</li>
    <li> very easy purchase and happy with the product and how fast the seller shipped it to me</li>
    <li> Never used this product before.  Recommended by my hair stylist in Boston.  It is excellent..</li>
    <li> I have been using these products before but was paying salon prices.  I&#x27;m very happy to have found it a little cheaper.  The company that send the product did so quickly.  I&#x27;m very pleased all around.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  However, it is a lot of work to get the last 10% out of the bottle.  It would be great if they changed their bottle shape to a squeezable style.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I purchased the shampoo and conditioner set. The smell of the product is wonderful. You also do not need to use alot for it to work. It leaves my hair smelling great and shiny. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to try a new brand.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Smells amazing.  Very moisturizing. I have long color treated hair and I am completely satisfied every use. Also it is super concentrated, so you need a little and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Didnt buy on Amazon but love it so much I had to review it anyway. All my family here and in Ireland have been hooked on another brand for years and I cant wait for them to try this one.Makes my thin colored hair look fabulous. Learned about it from my hairdresser and you know they always want to make you look good. I was convinced they had some secret product they were using so you only could have shiny hair after leaving the salon. Think this must be it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this to find a less expensive alternative to Pureology that will leave my hair healthy and manageable.  I loved it at first, my hair was soft and there was definitely less breakage.  After a while, I found the it started to leave a build up in my hair.  Had to stop using.</li>
