      <li>It smells good</li>
      <li>I always loved using Garnier when I was still in the Philippines.</li>

      <li>Really makes your face look flawless</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t never order this item any more.</li>
      <li>Love the fruity scent as well.</li>
      <li>I am sixteen with fair skin, and this really does the trick with my acne scars.</li>
      <li>so if I like it, the results may not be accurate since the chemicals etc may not be as the manufacturer intended.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel your skin right away</li>
      <li>When I learned I can buy it online, I did right away.</li>
      <li>this ia my first time to use cream for my face.</li>
      <li>Their products really do work for me!</li>
      <li>Did nothing for my fair african american skin tone.</li>
      <li>However, the products I used to buy aren&#x27;t available here in local stores in USA.</li>
      <li>how gentle it is to my skin type.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;ve used cosmetics past their expiration dates before, but I haven&#x27;t jumped in to use this one --</li>
      <li>so I will admit my assessment does not speak to the products full potential.  </li>
      <li>cuz I think I need to use it a little more.</li>
      <li>What use to take an hour to cover up and suffocate with makeup has been healed, and my new skin has been revealed.</li>
      <li>This stuff, after about a week, really did make a difference in the look of my skin, back to youthful dewey!</li>
      <li>I just started using this product and after I finally recieved it, it is working out so far.  </li>

    <li> the product I received is different from what i ordered.  Don&#x27;t be cheated by the image. They sent me a similar one which is 40 ml and not even 50 ml! I won&#x27;t never order this item any more.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t gotten this item,as soon as i get it &amp; use it,i&#x27;ll let you know how good &amp; well it works,i hope it does take away the blemish marks like it says it does,it was the reason i bought it. thank you!</li>
    <li> It smells good so I caan wear it to bed with no problem.  I can say I have seen some inprovement since I began using it.  However, I do not use it regularly so I will admit my assessment does not speak to the products full potential.  I can say that it lasts.  I will try to update if I see anything dramatic changing.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my fair african american skin tone. Sorry I bought so many.Will not buy again Crap in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER! I am sixteen with fair skin, and this really does the trick with my acne scars. What use to take an hour to cover up and suffocate with makeup has been healed, and my new skin has been revealed. Love the fruity scent as well.</li>

    <li> Not as expected, after the long wait for this product to arrive  there was no change in my skin, marks are still visible.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve used cosmetics past their expiration dates before, but I haven&#x27;t jumped in to use this one -- I may take the small risk and try it -- so if I like it, the results may not be accurate since the chemicals etc may not be as the manufacturer intended.</li>
    <li> Sadly, my skin has a stinging sensation every time i apply it.  It may be too soon to tell otherwise.</li>
    <li> this product works slower than the manufacturer promises but it does work.It is defiantely an alternative to expensive laser removal</li>
    <li> Really makes your face look flawless</li>
    <li> This stuff is so terrible when i just open the box the crean is flow out like half of the bottle. I doubtt maybe that&#x27;s from some customer&#x27;s return. so i can&#x27;t even use that and i throw that away.</li>
    <li> this ia my first time to use cream for my face. I ordered this one because.the brand its trusted and proven that.this is a good product. I will recommend this.to my friend.</li>

When I learned I can buy it online, I did right away. I like how it smells &amp; how gentle it is to my skin type. It doesn&#x27;t peel your skin right away but it does lighten in 2 months.</li>
