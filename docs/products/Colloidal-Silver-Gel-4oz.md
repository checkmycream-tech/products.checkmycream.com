<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My high expectations have been exceeded! Oh W O W ! I was bitten by a feral cat April 9th, hubs had me wash with soap &amp; water, peroxide it out, 3-in-1 ointment and bandage. It bled profusely. By the time the Animal Control Officer arrived it had bled through the bandage. She took a picture and advised get a tetanus shot. I received my gel 4/11/15 and immediately used a cotton tip to apply a layer to the puncture site and the claw marks.&lt;br /&gt;I was thankful for the appearance of the wound the next morning. Twice a day I layer the wounds and leave uncovered, limit movement for 20 minutes to set in real good. :) Today is the 14th and we are thrilled at the speedy healing that&#x27;s taken place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second task: Toenail fungus. I had allowed this problem to go too long without addressing it. Embarrassing at the nail salon, ugly and probably expensive to treat, right? Fungus was the primary reason I bought this gel. I take a cotton tip as an applicator and cover the entire toenail, great attention paid to the cuticle areas and of course the area at the top and behind the affected toenail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 10-toe application, while walking around, it feels like my toes had a breath mint! :D It&#x27;s too soon to make any determination on my fungi, but I am confident a measure of improvement will be evident in the near future.</li>
    <li> FAVORABLE- GREAT SIZE JAR FOR THE PRICE...A MUST HAVE FOR SKIN PROBLEMS AND BURNS, ETC</li>
    <li> it might work ( don&#x27;t know for whom), but it did nothing for neither me nor my dog.  We both use colloidal minerals of different brands with positive results, but with this one, nothing.  I will stick to the brands I know are good.</li>
    <li> In comparison to the other, it lacked in both healing properties and in strength overall.  Perhaps the silver isn&#x27;t high enough or that its missing the additional elements which make the other better - I am not certain if its a combination or some singularity.  In conclusion, I&#x27;d use the Ultra Colloidal Silver over this one.</li>
    <li> nice item,fast delivery</li>
    <li> Goof product, good price</li>
    <li> This heals wounds quickly and kills bacteria.  I am using it also to help heal surgical wounds but not sure if it will help with scarring.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taken me sometime to decide whether I like this product or not; but I&#x27;ve decided I like it. This is a nice product for dry skin. I don&#x27;t see where it has cured anything other than dry skin for me, but I do like the product.</li>
    <li> This product will always be in my cupboard in the bathroom.  My skin looks younger and is staying clear.  Wish I&#x27;d learned about it sooner.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my nurse practioner. I haven&#x27;t spoken with her yet. I gave it to her of her excema. I&#x27;m hoping it helped her.</li>
    <li> With trauma done to a hand and multiple surgeries,&lt;br /&gt;this product was helpful with scares healing faster&lt;br /&gt;than I expected. I keep extra gel on hand, for cuts&lt;br /&gt;or scraps as it fights off infection too.</li>
    <li> Great Price, great product,great for the skin. I&#x27;ve been using on my cystic acne. I&#x27;m no teenager I&#x27;m 45. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is great for my daughters skin. She has eczema and it does well on her skin. It has no odor and scents. Thanks</li>
    <li> I LOVE the soothing feel of this gel on my skin, and the fact that the ingredients are completely natural (no glycerine and/or mineral oil). I use this company&#x27;s lip balm too, and these products are the only ones that work for my dry and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Silver Miracles&amp;#34;, indeed!</li>
    <li> I like to keep it as one of my first aid possibilities have been using it for 3 years</li>
    <li> i struggle with eczema and sensitive skin, but my son and I also use it on our face to help prevent break outs. the gel is odorless, not heavy, and it absorbs quickly. totally recommend buying if you struggle with sensitive or acne prone skin. hope this was helpful.</li>
    <li> I like the jar vs the tube.  I can contol how much I want better.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS INCREDIBLE.  I have been bitten more than once by brown recluse spiders.&lt;br /&gt;These bites are very dangerous.  Research them and you will learn that the skin is affected by both the spider&#x27;s venom and the streptococcus bacteria that all spiders carry.&lt;br /&gt;The brown recluse spider does not want to bite you - it just wants to be left alone.  This time I was  pulling weeds out of sidewalks of our old, Victorian home.  Never saw it get me and perhaps it was a different species of spider...all that are large enough to put two fang-marks into human or animal skin can do the damage.... but from experience, when I saw the six inches radiating from the middle of my leg to the ankle, and from the other direction up to the knee.....red:  I knew that blood poisoning was occurring.  I used another product that is wonderful and watched (Natural Path/Silver Wings  Silver Herbal  Ointment).  I continued to place the ointment and then a small seashell to protect the area and held in place by athletic adhesive tape.  I would leave this on for three days at a time, then let it air-dry during the day.  Then I started with the Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this miracle gel does not have the herbs that the salve has, I then proceeded to start using this.&lt;br /&gt;It is so pure and, while it contains much less amount of colloidal silver, I have to tell you what has happened.  It is incredible...I have to say this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;Every night I rub some of this miracle stuff on and let it evaporate, leaving the then-healing area exposed.  The next morning the result is unavoidable to behold.  Now half the size or less red.  I again anoint the wound with a sall amount of the gel  A spider bite may never totally heal, but it can be walled off by a healthy immune system.&lt;br /&gt;Homeopathic results take longer but they are building up the body&#x27;s ability to handle a problem, I guess. My quarter-size wound (if I hadn&#x27;t scratched it !) would have had black,necrotized tissue that would fester and work deeper and deeper.  I have experienced all of this before, as I previously stated.&lt;br /&gt;This time...in seven weeks...the wound is tiny and pinkish red.  It is about healed....is the size of a man&#x27;s button-down shirt button!  I have shown it to friends and they see its weekly improvement and are amazed as they have followed my prior experiences over the last twenty years.  We live in farm country in a village of 900 people.  Lots of grass, trees, bugs, birds, squirrels, raccoons and more.&lt;br /&gt;Bravo Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Gel.  Fantastic.  Thank you for continuing to supply us who believe in pure products and treating ourselves!&lt;br /&gt;Again to mention that the other product is made by Silver Wings/Natural Path is called Silver Herbal Ointment&lt;br /&gt;nancy morse</li>
    <li> Helps heal faster, great product</li>
    <li> Silver Miracles is an excellent bi-name for this product.  Colloidal Silver Gel has many great applications as it destroys so many kinds of bacteria, viruses and fungi.</li>
    <li> If you use colloidal silver liquid, this one is great for kids &amp; animals for scrapes &amp; bites, etc or skin irritations of any type.  I used this on my dog&#x27;s foot pads when he cut one because he licks any medication - this one absorbs quickly &amp; if he licked it - there seemed to be no side effects and the silver is naturally antimicrobial; this gel has no smell at all</li>
    <li> After I bought this I researched it&#x27;s use.  I don&#x27;t think it will suit my needs.  I suggest you read research before using.</li>
    <li> Good product, helps stop the itch of poison ivy.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a relative who had terrible itchy skin and was not getting any relief from other products so I&#x27;m rating it according to their feedback.  It seems to be working well where nothing else has.  I will definitely be ordering this for myself.</li>
    <li> Atopic dermatitis and found the soap combined with the gel works for me.  It,is well worth the price to try it!  Also, cheaper and less long term effects that steroids all the time.</li>
    <li> Colloidal Silver gel cleared brown age spots from my hands and I am very pleased about that,  thank you  for your product.</li>
    <li> I wish I met this gel years ago.  Best gel I ever I own.  I spend hours &amp; no telling how much I spend money @ medical bills</li>
    <li> Love colloidal silver products.  This is a&lt;br /&gt;Very good one.</li>
    <li> Great for skin infections and irritations. Safe even for babies and and sensitive parts of the skin. You can use it inside the ears or private parts and around the eyes( if it gets inside it will not cause any irritation). You can also use it to prevent infections in cuts or burns anddiaper rash.</li>
    <li> This company needs quality control.  I found a large piece of plastic in the jar.  Makes me wonder what else is in there?  Anyway, I purchased for eczema.  It actually made me rash out. I will be throwing this jar away. :(</li>
    <li> Great price for something that heals my staph infection sores. I was scared that I would have to go back to the doctor to drain and pack the sore with gauze (so painful). My Aunt told me about colloidal silver and all the sores that I have have healed due to colloidal silver. I have used numerous sulfa drugs and antibiotics and nothing works. This product works.</li>
    <li> This version of silver is fairly strong, stronger than American Biotech Labs (my Gold Standard) normally sells in the USA. It&#x27;s fabulous for more serious injuries on your body, like the nasty ugly scar a hand surgeon left on my finger when he ripped it open and put a rod in it, and it was refusing to heal, or like the nasty face-full of big puffy toxin-bumps on my face and body rash that broke out when the hospital gave me only tylenol-based \\&quot;pain\\&quot; medication and I had an allergic reaction. I usually don&#x27;t use this gel on my face unless I scratch off a scab so badly that it&#x27;s bleeding (bad habit) and then only on that spot itself because it&#x27;s strong enough that it can be drying to the rest of the facial skin that&#x27;s NOT injured. It&#x27;s also great for athlete&#x27;s foot or for healing dry winter cracks on your heels; I put generous layers on them, cover with big bandages, or gauze and tape for as many days as it takes. Great stuff, many uses!</li>
    <li> This product contains a highly toxic compound called triethanolamine. Do a simple google search and you will see that it is very bad stuff. It&#x27;s known to cause a sorts of serious problems. Including cancer, immune, and respiratory problems. Triethanolamine is banned in the UK and Europe -- It&#x27;s status in the USA is currently under review. I didn&#x27;t know it had Triethanolamine until i got the jar and looked at the ingredients list. Take the information as you will... personally I wish I would have know before ordering, I would have passed on the purchase.</li>
    <li> use for my eczema.  like it very much</li>
    <li> This is very good for oily skin on the face. I also used it post operation of removing a wrist dorsal ganglion cyst on the scar tissue. Overall I am pleased and will continue to use this for my face as will my wife. I also use oral liquid colliodial silver when I feel like I am coming down with a cold, or after dental work.</li>
    <li> Found this gel rather effective...the best I&#x27;ve found so far for clearing up blemishes you get now and then.  Do question the use of triethanolamine...which I&#x27;d guess is used to make it act as a gel rather than a liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective for cuts/scrapes....various stubborn skin issues....even works on a psoriasis type area near my elbow which nothing else would affect.</li>
    <li> I bought this for hand eczema as it clearly states that it is designed for this on the jar. Not only did it not help but it exacerbated my hands into the worst breakout in 2 years. I am finally getting back to where I was before using it which was a mild to moderate case. It looks like &amp;#34;thick water&amp;#34; and leaves a slightly sticky residue when dry.</li>
    <li> I did not notice until too late to return but the top is severely cracked, not sure if I can use it.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. I had a pressure sore that just wouldn&#x27;t heal. Even with a Rx from the dermatologist, it was still bleeding and very sore. After using this for 3 days, it was much better. I think this gel is great for any kind of sore or irritation.</li>
    <li> This year has been the first time I&#x27;ve suffered eczema... in a word &amp;#34;hell&amp;#34;.  Nothing totally makes it go away.  But this product not only eases the itching and burning, but keeps the areas I&#x27;ve scratched raw (can&#x27;t help it), from getting infected.</li>
    <li> Great for burns, bug bites healing blemishes quickly. Good stuff. I highly recommend this for your medicine cabinets. Get some!</li>
    <li> Honestly this gel hasn&#x27;t helped much at all. Just seems like watery gel.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to add to my first aid kits. I got a pretty bad burn on my arm not too long after getting this product and it healed quickly with using the Gel.</li>
    <li> The product does what it is designed for.  However, the Gel is messy and hard to keep where you want it.</li>
    <li> Every home should have a jar of this.  It can be used on all kinds of skin injuries and really promotes healing.</li>
    <li> But honestly I can&#x27;t tell if this stuff works or not. I use it for itchy spots, the same things you&#x27;d use hand moisturizer for. It looks interesting, kind of a clear gel stuff, no scent. I understand that silver is beneficial for you, think of silverware in the old days, or farmers using silver milk buckets to collect milk. Any benefit might just be believing that it&#x27;s doing you some good. But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing any harm. I feel good about this product.</li>
    <li> It was a gel -----that&#x27;s about all I can say.  It certainly was not worth the price nor the postage.  Poor product.</li>
    <li> if you want this to work even better... put it in a Nubian pyramid for 30 days.</li>
    <li> works for sores and stuff</li>
    <li> This product works better that I could have imagined.  Great for cuts, scrapes, bug bites, and burns.  Great product</li>
    <li> Many benefits of colloidal silver</li>
    <li> Was allergic to this :(</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT GREAT SELLER WILL BUY AGAIN.  This product is so good for acne would never be without it. I tend to break out from the steam&lt;br /&gt;room and this clears it right up.</li>
    <li> every was great and quick to receive. thanks</li>
    <li> I had never used silver until last Winter when I paid a fortune for 0.5 oz. curad silver. It worked so well I decided to check Amazon for a better price.Not only did I find a better price I found a better product in the Silver Miracles Colloidal Silver Gel More PPM,Best price. It&#x27;s wonderful for rashes, burns, cuts and my husbands excema. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I feel better applying this stuff to the children&#x27;s minor scrapes and scratches opposed to these antibiotic ointments.</li>
    <li> Texture seems well and absorption. Nicely packaged.</li>
    <li> Wow, this works great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a bad break out of eczema.. works like a charm and so much better than steriod creams!</li>
    <li> I use this product to remove any bumps on my legs from workingout/sweating in sweat pants, shaving my legs or irritants from laundry detergent. Works like a champ! It&#x27;s a miracle product!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing healing product.  I keep it on hand for cuts, bruises, rashes and anything else requiring topical healing.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Was hoping to target my nail fungus.  Does not really do much, just dries my feet out (they are dry as it is)</li>
    <li> I love colloidal silver period, but when I found this gel I was excited to use it for a disease I have called hydradenitus supperativa. After two days of applying it 3 times a day, I noticed that the burning, itching and inflammation had gone down about 50%. With continued use it has promoted draining. My skin also does not feel as tight, enabling a little more move which was lost.</li>
    <li> I have found so many uses for this, just yesterday it was for a wasp sting on my kid&#x27;s hand...</li>
    <li> I use it in combination their w/x-strength soap and my skin is improving by leaps and bounds!&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to anyone w/serious skin issues.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face for my acne mostly and it works wonders! I have had attrocious acne since I turned 19 and nothing has helped nowthat I am pregnant it got much worse. I use raw black african soap to wash my face, then put this on, let it soak it then use organic virgin coconut oil to moisturise and my skin has cleared up so fast and so thoroughly! I definitely recommend all three products!</li>
    <li> This gel works.  It takes care of cold sores (when caught in the first stages), boils (when caught early), acne, heat rashes, etc.  I always make sure I have some of this on hand.  This particular doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> I cant prove to weather or not this thing actually works or not but, i have had a few instances where i can not deny that this stuff does help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mosquito bites are one of the things, but this stuff is amazing on burns i burnt myself really bad and i put this stuff on it and my burn stopped hurting fast, no scaring and the next day it almost felt healed...</li>
    <li> This product has a highly toxic chemical added in at the very end. Very sneaky..about to send it back and order something else. Ugh I should have read the review sooner.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the house uses it from scrapes to sunburn, works fantastic.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that is very versatile in many situations.</li>
    <li> Good value,good product ,works as well as other silver products that cost more per ounce, quality seems equal.Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I used this to pull the inflamation down on my ingrown toenail as a natural &amp;#34;antibiotic&amp;#34;. Afterwards I was able to cut the nail out. It also works for other skin problems such as fungus.</li>
    <li> Every home should have some</li>
    <li> Just as described a clear gel that absorbs into the skin quickly, it hasn&#x27;t stained or left any discoloring on my clothes.</li>
    <li> So happy to find this gel! I&#x27;m a strong believer in the benefits of colloidal silver, so this is perfect for the 2 legged human skin conditions &amp; our 4 legged pets!</li>
    <li> super product. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have  precancerous spots on both arms and they have always made me look like a spotted leopard.  I know the benefits of Colloidal Silver and this gel surprised me.  My arms always itched and was embarrassed to wear short sleeves.&lt;br /&gt;This gel takes very little and spreads nicely without a greasy residu.&lt;br /&gt;at first when you use it, as ut heals the dry itchy skin you may get s few dry spots.  Just use a small amount if lotion.  After about a week it starts looking better.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend uses it for his itchy skin snd msn it works great.&lt;br /&gt;This IS NOT a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Using this cream has diminished the raised old age spots on my body.  On my face it has helped to lessen blemishes and I hope through continued use will eliminate them totally.</li>
    <li> I like the product very much. Too bad it comes in a huge mailing box, but the product itself is terrific.</li>
    <li> I used this on my face. I have dry spots chapped spots, after putting the gel on my face I had a cooling relief. made my skin very soft. I like it.</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin up significantly over night. I used it everywhere and seemed to help wrinkles, stretch marks, age spots &amp; everything. Amazing stuff, even if just for dry skin and acne. It healed a bad spot on my fingernail where I cut off too much, and we all know how annoying that can be.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face as a &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; and healer.  I use it after a shower on my scalp psoriasis.  I also use it for diaper rash and infections, etc.  It is soothing, pure and natural. It yields results.</li>
    <li> This is really helping my skin, I am using it on healing sores (not open sores) and I love it!</li>
    <li> We use this gel for cuts, burns, infection, you name it it just cannot be beat for natural healing. Plus this is such a good price and it is shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I have always used colloidal silver products, but never a gel. It works wonders on old scars and wounds and I can use it easily on my dog without it running off.</li>
    <li> the only thing I noticed was it kept my skin from being dry otherwise I said no benefits whatever .I will probably not buy it again</li>
    <li> My sister uses a different brand and loves it... I ventured for the cheaper route and was disappointed. It really didn&#x27;t do anything I thought it would...</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It appeared ok for a few days, then gradually turned to water. Useless for the purpose for which it was intended and a waste of money. I notice it&#x27;s now unavailable, maybe others have had the same issue with it. I wouldn&#x27;t have been repurchasing anyhow as what I got was not what I wanted or paid for.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used coloidal silver for several years for such things as upset stomach ,etc.It has worked wonders with NO side effects.It stops viruses that prescriptions don&#x27;t touch.</li>
    <li> Great as a gel but didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.  There isn&#x27;t much else to say about it.</li>
    <li> Seems to work fine for faster healing.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs a jar.</li>
    <li> This product was not as described in the photo.Completely different container....I still use it but will be buying from someone else... :o(</li>
    <li> Shiny and bright. Seems to help eczema​ as I had hoped.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my mother, who uses this faithfully for multiple topical issues, promotes healing and fades age spots.</li>
    <li> I use my colloidal gel with my copper bracelet.. real relief..</li>
    <li> The added ingredient is one I have an allegry to, I thought it was pure , without additives.</li>
    <li> As was described by the seller ! This CSG deserves a good comment,because is a good disinfectant,is good to eliminate the itching of insects bite or allergic rash, and is odorless. The gel is very smooth and refreshing.</li>
    <li> I just love it! It also helps when skin itches</li>
    <li> very fast shipping.  great stuff</li>
    <li> this didn&#x27;t help my psoriasis at all&lt;br /&gt;in fact, it felt like it dried out my skin more&lt;br /&gt;finished the whole tub, and didn&#x27;t see any change</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. My husband uses this on his skin. Helps with all irritations, softens and more. We also use the liquid silver to help fight infections.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great on athlete&#x27;s foot, spider bites, and crossfit rips!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I can not thank you enough. Years of doctors! Years of antibiotics! Only one week of using this product and I feel like a new woman! I had cervical spine surgery and the incision never healed...three years later, a fortune in hospital stays, infectious disease doctors. I can not believe I never heard of this before! I am so happy! Thank you! Thank YOU!</li>
    <li> We use silver gel for cuts and such every time, without fail. It&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a nurse and I used to work in the burn unit, where we used a cream with silver in it to reduce bacteria. This was more effective than antibiotic creams, and it was my understanding that the bacteria do not seem to develop a resistance to silver, as they do to antibiotics.</li>
    <li> great product that heals fast.</li>
    <li> This is truly a miraculous product too!  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate at all to recommend this to any of my closest friends.  It is better to use a natural product any day compared to a cortisone product....................................</li>
    <li> This item has worked great from human&#x27;s to pet&#x27;s and am a firm believer in the healing type properties silver has...watching a young adult with hoof/mouth/and foot disease (a virus that is common but less spoken about)stop itching and rash went away within a day...well she&#x27;s a believer that Grandma knows a little bit about alternative products due to the over use of antibiotic&#x27;s. So if you are not allergic to silver or any components...you might think about giving it a try. Thank you</li>
    <li> I am allergic to antibiotics and I made the mistake of using a prescription antifungal medication in my belly button which was constantly cracking open after healing following a surgery.  By the next morning it was cherry red and oozing pus.  Apparently I had reacted to the cream and developed an infection from it overnight.  Since I am allergic to antibiotics, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to go to the doctor unless there is no way I can take care of something on my own.  So I used tea tree oil and zinc oxide.  I also cleaned it out with hydrogen peroxide every two hours and re-treated.  It became extremely painful, but some of the redness went down.  It was oozing like crazy.  You could actually see the fluid flowing thru the skin.  I was desperate and afraid to go to the doctor for yet another antibiotic I would react to, so I ordered the Silver Miracles silver gel and in the meanwhile I tried the CVS silver gel for one day, which might have helped a little, but there was not definitive difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Silver Miracles silver gel yesterday afternoon and treated it.  I came home today and took a picture for comparrison to see how it was doing.  Yesterday it was a pretty good deep rosey color towards the top with hard swollen areas and a deep red deeper in the belly button.  Today almost everything you can see is a normal skin color and you can see towards the bottom of the belly button it is still bright red.  I didn&#x27;t find any visual evidence of the oozing either.  That&#x27;s an amazing difference in just one day.  In addition, you should know that the infection started almost 2 weeks ago and was kind of stuck at a certain point.  I was really afraid I was going to have to go to the doctor and risk another serious allergic reaction.  I am very hopeful that this is going to take care of the infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, this product is much more cost effective than the one from CVS pharmacy that cost around $8 for 1/2 an ounce vs this one that cost nearly $12 for 4 ounces.  The only thing I would have liked better would have been to have it in a pump instead of a jar, but that&#x27;s not a major thing and it looks like this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  It has now been a week since I first started using the Silver Miracles gel.  It looks so much better.  There are no longer any hard swollen areas, blistery areas and there are only the pink cracks that were originally there that I was trying to treat and ended up being the entry point for the infection.  If I try to treat it with peroxide now it doesn&#x27;t bubble at all.  The silver seems to kill everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important point.  While family doctors typically don&#x27;t prescribe silver gel and are a bit more stuck on antibiotics or occasionally an antibiotic and silver combo (Silvadene), the Wound Clinic at the hospital actually does use Silver Gel on chronic wounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t reommend avoiding the doctor quite like I did as it can be dangerous, but I definitely recommend this silver gel.  I recommend having it on hand and if you should develop a minor wound, try it.  If you are not getting better within a day or two, have pain, swelling, blisters, red streaks, and/or a fever... go to the doctor.  But if you use it and keep it on the wound with a bandage, I don&#x27;t think you will have a problem.early $12 for 4 ounces.

    <li> So far it has worked on my skin problem on my ears as well....and maybe better....that the $30 (my cost) prescription I got from the doctor.  If it continues to work this could be a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> My son likes to put it on his face to prevent blackheads and whiteheads, keeps his skin clean. My sinuses got infected and I used it and the silver relieved the pain and cleared them up.</li>
    <li> I bought this product due to the Source Naturals Silver Salve I normally use being out of stock. It just doesn&#x27;t measure up to what I am used to in regard to fast healing, consistency and relieving soreness etc.</li>
    <li> This is one of the products that was used before the advent of antibiotics. It seems to effectively treat all manner of skin conditions, from acne to cold sores to eczema. It&#x27;s not a miracle or a panacea. It sometimes works better in conjunction with other therapies. But I am convinced of its efficacy as a stand alone product.</li>
    <li> While it helps somewhat... Some issues require Neosporin or Bactroban.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful and it does help with itchy skin...  rashes and other issues like bites etc.  I would truly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product came as described by amazon with no packaging problems and no product problems. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I use this for yeast infections my 11 year old pup gets between her toes and it stops the constant licking rifght away.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, great for family, humans and four legged members as well ;) we use it on all skin issues even mouth sores, bites or cuts on our dogs too. Great stuff, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d buy the gel and mix it with my own vitamin E cream and that way save money because the silver cream is a lot more expensive.  Well, it didn&#x27;t work.  Even when I mixed it with my own cream, it really stung my hands.  I went back to buying the cream which works great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that could calm the inflamed skin on my face from acne. The first problem is that the makers of the gel do not tell you what the inactive ingredients are. The labeling is very amateur and could be made by anyone in their spare room or garage.  There is no proof of quality control and the creators of this product leave you guessing about the potency, ingredients, sources, and uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen no improvement and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day after washing.  It feels like it dries up the skin and makes it feel very tight, but witch hazel would do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed....I wasted my money.  Now off to find a real company that didn&#x27;t just print stickers on their home computer and bottle up god knows what.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care what the folks with diplomas say about colloidal silver. The stuff works better and for a lot less money than our healthcare system.</li>
    <li> I really like this product to help with my stress induced skin outbreaks. It is an antibacterial and anti-fungal gel.</li>
    <li> Contains some bad ingredients.</li>
    <li> I purchased this and the soap also and together they worked miracles.  I have had some abrasions on my lower legs that started with very dry skin and I could not get them to heal.  In less that a month I now have legs that look normal instead of like alligator skin.</li>
    <li> A little goes a very long way and it has helped heal a sore that nothing has worked on in 6 months!  I definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Takes away foot fungus and diaper rash!!  There are other uses...many other uses!!</li>
    <li> I got this product to see if it would help my shingles on my back.  I didn&#x27;t really notice a change but since I stopped using it on a regular basis (I am bad about that!) I really can&#x27;t say if it would have worked.  My shingles are gone but the nerve was damaged which affected my upper back - my skin is numb and my nerve endings keep sending signals that my skin itches (very very annoying).  I was hoping for some relief with any product so I do not feel that because I did not have a good response to this product that I should give it a low star review.  The product did arrive quickly and packaged well.  I will be giving this product another chance and if it helps, great, but not expecting a miracle.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something to help with acne and a recent eczema issue. I am thrilled with this product! I applied at night and the next morning saw a huge improvement. It took about two weeks (applied a small amount each night) to completely clear up the eczema, but it was well worth the wait. My skin is very smooth and healthy. I hardly ever get any break outs now. If I do I simply apply a small dab and it clears up the redness very quickly. The gel dries clear and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue at all. There isn&#x27;t any odor. Great find!</li>
    <li> As always Amazon provides great service and wonderful products.  I received my order exactly as promised.  The Colloidal Silver Gel is a must to keep on hand for injuries, especially burns.  Works wonders. Ann</li>
    <li> This gel is very nice and soothing for any skin condition, from a rash to just dry skin. Not sticky after it dries thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly. Very good price.</li>
    <li> Just as good as what I had before, just a little bit more for the money.</li>
    <li> Seriously micrale product. I applied on my arm, that I burnt while baking, and it&#x27;s been like 6 days and you can barely see any mark.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my five year old son because he has bad eczema and the reviews were so wonderful but it is not working for us.</li>
    <li> There are many uses for the colloidal silver gel but the way I use it is for \\&quot;stinky feet\\&quot;.  Many of us have had this battle for years.  Powders, sprays, creams....you name it and I&#x27;ve tried it with some measure of success but not complete odor removal.  Recently I purchased Silver Miracles and this is the BEST!  Within 2 days feet and shoes were odor free.  I simply rubbed s small amount of gel over soles of feet including toes and what a miracle!  For the first week I used it every day but now not so often.  So glad to have found a solution for my feet!</li>
    <li> Best healing product on the market!  Please buy you  will love it ,skin heals so fast .for all types of skin problems. Should be the number one product for dermatologist Doctors</li>
    <li> Same as the soap, really no difference.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> ...amd works just as well-- maybe better!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;word word word word word word word word word word word word word!</li>
    <li> This is really a nice option to have when it comes to a  colloidal  Silver product.  Put it on an area on daughter&#x27;s arm and cleared it right up.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get any better than this...A great external aid for cuts and abrasions with a cunning ability to keep bacteria at  bay...</li>
