<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Someone also commented it was not 100% boar bristle. The online description itself does not state its 100% though the label on the bag it came it did. So that&#x27;s a blow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only tried brushing my hair with it this evening and so far it seems to be spreading the oil around fine, will update if I notice anything else off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want 100% boar bristles and not a mix, go look at something else.</li>
    <li> This brush is about 50% boar bristles and 50% nylon. My hair is by no means thick, but I still have to section my hair to brush. It seems to do an alright job. I noticed no chemical smell that some people have posted about, nor are my bristles falling out, but I&#x27;ve only used it once since I got it, so I might update the review as time goes on.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Great! After brushing, my hair looks glamorous and feels really soft!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush.  Really gets through my hair to my scalp.  I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s and my hair had gotten dull and lifeless, used to always be soft and shiny.  I read that using a boar bristle brush would help distribute the oils from my scalp through my hair to bring back some of the shine.  I&#x27;m using it daily and it does seem to make a difference.  And my scalp feels more alive, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is well-made and should last a good, long time.  Customer service and follow-up is particularly good with this product, too.  It&#x27;s clear the company making the brush wants to do a good job.  Refreshing.</li>
    <li> This brush is very good at distributing the natural oils throughout my hair with a little bit of time each day. It leaves my thick hair silky and a little wavy (and it seems to make it seem less thicker than it is when I use other brushes), the way it&#x27;s supposed to be. It had a unique scent when I opened the package, but I don&#x27;t pay it much mind  any more...not since seeing the results. I will definitely buy this again, when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Real boar&#x27;s hair! I did the lighter test &amp; it is 100% real.</li>
    <li> Nicely made brush. My daughter and I have very  thick hair so the brush can&#x27;t go all the way through. But it did help oil spread the hair.</li>
    <li> Great size for my long hair.  Won a comparison with my old brush before I throw it out.</li>
    <li> The brush came pretty quickly and in good condition. It was a bit bigger than I thought, but it&#x27;s not a problem. The bristles are strong and firm which is good.  No complaints so far.</li>
    <li> A very nice brush for the money.  Does not pull my grand daughters hair like the cheaper plastic brushes.</li>
    <li> NOT 100% Boar Bristle Brush!</li>
    <li> I just ordered this brush and have only used it a total of two times but I love it!!! I have thick, long hair and it makes my hair soft and manageable. I love that it is all natural boar bristle and that it&#x27;s a nice sturdy paddle brush. The product is exactly as described in the description and Gran Goods has been wonderful! This is definitely a product I will reorder again and recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my first boar brush, and so far I love it. I use it at night before bed or before a shower, not as my everyday brush to get ready. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and have noticed a significant different in how shiny and soft my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, using it does make my hair a little more oily at the roots, so I don&#x27;t use it before work or before going out. Perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong or not often enough. It&#x27;s a great brush to use to make hair shinier and so far it&#x27;s been great right before a shower or bed.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! I would agree with the quality described by the vendor. I have fine, straight hair and was only using a wide tooth comb on my hair to prevent breakage but needed something to smooth and distribute my dry shampoo. This works wonderfully and helps me achieve the volume I want in my hair.</li>
    <li> Very strong boar hair. Brushes hair very well and even brings back the shine. A bit hard on scalp for those who are sensitive (that time of the month). Found new hobby - brushing my wife&#x27;s hair... And she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy. Will not fall apart. We like it. Approved.</li>
    <li> The brush is nicely made but having never used a boar bristle brush before, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I have thin hair, straight hair so I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have an issues brushing my hair with this brush. But I felt like it was only brushing the top layer of my hair and wasn&#x27;t going all the way through which I didn&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ve used it a few times on both wet and dry hair and felt the same way each time so it&#x27;s not something I would personally continue to use.</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  This brush is unique in that it is made so well as to be multi functional. Brush your hair or brush lint, dust, debris off of you trousers or jacket when travelling. Great item to pack and have along.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed when I bought the brush was that it had a terrible smell. I hoped the smell would dissipate but it&#x27;s been over a week and it still reeks. To make matters worse, the smell transfers to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;With regard to how it brushes, I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed. The bristles only reach the very top layer of hair. I have very thick, waist-length hair and this brush just isn&#x27;t working for me.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice that it distributed that natural oils in my hair at all. I&#x27;ve had better luck in that department with the Tangle Teezer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed so I&#x27;m going to return the product.</li>
    <li> great brush, great price!! my daughter has very curly hair and this brush just goes right through it no problem and leaves her hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Great product. My daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> Good quality boar bristle brush..does a good job on my hair</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry, frizzy hair and took a chance on this brush because it is made to distribute oils from your scalp down to the ends of your hair for a healthy skin and stronger locks. I would never use this for general brushing or detangling. It is not meant for that anyway. I&#x27;ve found that my hair is generally too thick and the bristles are too short to really reach through a large clump of hair, so I need to use this brush in small sections of hair to get the desired result. It did leave my hair feeling softer afterwards.</li>
    <li> Great brush been using it for awhile now and its calmed my curly beard down a lot</li>
    <li> I have long, straight, fine hair and this works beautifully to detangle my hair and give me shine. I haven&#x27;t noticed any smell but I&#x27;ve also only used it on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;On another note, my boyfriend has discovered the brush and it works just as well on his thick short hair as it does on mine, so I think pretty much any type can use it.</li>
    <li> Brush quality and sizes were exactly as described.  Service sending the package and email follows ups were great!</li>
    <li> Of all the brushes in the drawer, this is the one my 6 year old goes for, the one that doesn&#x27;t make her whine and complain the whole time. It&#x27;s not my favorite, because it makes her curly hair frizz when it&#x27;s dry, but it&#x27;s great for smoothing damp ponytails.</li>
    <li> This has proven to be an excellent purchase. It did have a noticeably plastic smell when unwrapped, as noted by some other reviewers, but it faded quickly and has not been a problem since. It does an excellent job on my wife&#x27;s hair, and she claims she wishes she&#x27;d bought one forever ago. Very durable and solidly made - I expect we won&#x27;t ever have to buy another one. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great brush!!  Leaves hair silky and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, the bristles are soft. If you have thick hair this probably will not be touch your scalp</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a boar bristle brush before (or any natural type of natural bristle, I suspect), I&#x27;d recommend googling some info about them before buying. You don&#x27;t use them quite the same way you&#x27;d use a brush with hard plastic bristles. You definitely want to comb the tangles out of your hair first, for example, and wait until your hair is dry to brush it. (Maybe you&#x27;re supposed to do those things anyway, for all I know -- I have shorter hair so it&#x27;s easier for me to use brushes incorrectly without too much damage, but I find plastic brushes more forgiving.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of those things, I&#x27;m not sure a boar bristle brush would be great for styling my hair -- but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that anyway. I bought it more as a type of hair treatment, to get the benefits of boar bristle brushing: distributing oils evenly, improving the condition of the hair, stimulating the scalp, extending time between washes, etc. I have oily hair, but all that oil just build up on my scalp. With this brush, my hair feels and looks much more balanced. I do get some static while brushing, but it settles down quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is durable, seems high quality, and has a ton of nice stiff bristles. It feels great on my scalp, and I love being able to help my hair&#x27;s health without having to slather on a ton of extra treatment products!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great brush for the price. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect!  Bristles are stiff enough to tame even the unruliest of heads!</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome! It makes my hair very shiny and smooths all the frizz... when my hair is tangled it will untangle it without ripping out my hair. overall i love this Brush!</li>
    <li> this was a gift to the eldest son and his longggggggg beard and he says he likes the brush</li>
    <li> used one day, seems good</li>
    <li> Better for thin hair, but it works great!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush for conditioning and cleaning hair.  I got this for my niece who has long hair to use at night.  It cleans away the dust and pollen of the day and leaves the hair soft.</li>
    <li> On the positive side, the brush does help to make my (short) hair more manageable, presumably by distributing hair oils more evenly. But I was disappointed at the clunky appearance of the brush. I have fairly small hands, and the brush seems too wide and over-sized. Of course a wooden handle is durable, that goes without saying. I think the brush could have been designed better, especially with female customers in mind. Also, the bristles are fairly short, which contributes to the impression that the dimensions just aren&#x27;t quite right.</li>
    <li> This brush is not for women.  The bristles are 1/2 inch long and only appropriate for short, short hair.  I wish the description had mentioned this detail.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was hoping for, leaves my hair very soft and shiny!</li>
    <li> It is a great hairbrush. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It combs out the static on my hair, so my hair is not that fussy anymore. Live saver!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with their service and the product. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My hair is quite short, but I still manage to get cowlicks. This brush has nicely stiff bristles which tame my unruly hair. It also stimulates the scalp promoting good circulation.</li>
    <li> I used it to brush my dog. She usually stays still and let me brush her - it makes a really good pet brush.</li>
    <li> Love this brush!  Some Boar bristle brushes are too soft, this one is really nice, has some stiff bristles which go through my hair nicely and the softer ones really help the natural oil distribution well.  Nice sturdy handle.  Very happy I found this.</li>
    <li> I am actually pretty happy with this brush for the almost week I&#x27;ve been using it!  The bristles are good and stiff, so they were able to get through most of the layers of my hair, and it does a seriously terrifying good job of volumizing.  Or floofing, in my case.  Easily remedied with a little spritzing with water.  Or not, if you&#x27;re into floof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few cons to the brush, but nothing that should stop you from buying it, should you be looking for a nice brush to give yourself a nice scalp massage/shine to your hair/add volume... and other such things.  There IS a smell that comes from the rubber bedding that the bristles rest in from using recycled rubber.  However, if you let the brush air out after unboxing, the wafting odor goes away.  You&#x27;d literally have to stick your nose in the bristles to be able to smell the rubber scent again, and it doesn&#x27;t brush the smell into your hair.  Believe me, I&#x27;ve done just that, much to the angst and irritation of my poor snoot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are juuuuust slightly shorter than I like, but it still grazes the scalp enough to give some nice stimulation (a pretty darn good itchin&#x27; relief) to your scalp.  I know most people are used to a brush giving the full on scritchin&#x27; experience to your scalp, but I find that usually a lot of that, no matter how delicious it feels, usually makes my hair uber oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those very little things, it&#x27;s a good boars bristle brush to invest in, I think!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair, my hair is on the thinner side and this brush does not penetrate my hair.  I have gotten better brushes by Goody.  Also, the bristles themselves are very short, which is parts of the problem, if they were longer this would be a nicer brush.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought a hair brush in years, but a boar&#x27;s bristle one was recommended to me by my hairstylist. I have curly hair, so I don&#x27;t wash it every day, but the night before I wash it, I comb it out with this brush. It&#x27;s great. It gets through my tangles without tearing out huge clumps of hair and it distributes the natural oils. My only complaint is that the handle is a little too thin for my big hands, but I just have to learn to work with it.</li>
    <li> well made,reasonably priced. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> First thing I noticed was a very powerful chemical smell upon opening the box,followed by seeing that  the majority of bristles were a  uniform length/width nylon... VERY disappointing. I feel cheated both by the seller and the reviewers who did not bring this obvious deception to light.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that can be hard to keep in place.  With this brush, it smooths out the ends and lays much better.  Hair feels softer too.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST hairbrush I have ever had.  It makes my hair look great.  You won&#x27;t go wrong getting one for yourself.  A great buy.</li>
    <li> this brush really does make your hair smoother and shiny. and it does not pull hairs out either. love it</li>
    <li> The brush was all I hoped it would be and more. I am glad I lost my old brush on a recent trip.</li>
    <li> It does appear to have some plastic bristles in it.  I wish it was softer.</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome. I love the way it feels.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  My daughters have long thick hair and they adore this brush.  It leaves their hair shiny and beautiful.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t comb through my hair as well as I had hoped it would. I like firm brushes but this brush is entirely to stiff. It does not work for fine, curly AfroCentric hair. It does not lay down my edges well. It does not reach my scalp (the point in buying this brush was to massage my scalp). In the past, boar brushes leave my hair soft and shiny and my ends smoothed out. I don&#x27;t get any of those results with this brush. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Nice quality brush - made my hair look shiny!</li>
    <li> Very good, stiff brush.  Loving the natural boar bristles.  It&#x27;s helping greatly with my psoriasis.</li>
    <li> Great strong handle and bristles get through long thick hair.</li>
    <li> The brush is fantastic- arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged.  Paired with some deep conditioning, my daughter&#x27;s hair looks and feels soft and shiny!!</li>
    <li> Long wait but it was worth it. soft bristie hair brush. My old brush was over 30 years old and&lt;br /&gt;I expect the same from this great brush.</li>
    <li> this is a not bad brush for long or short hair. it does it&#x27;s job. nice wood handle. the bristles are stiff and it doesn&#x27;t look like 100% boar bristle (maybe 50%).</li>
    <li> Good  product no problems.&lt;br /&gt;Charles Policastro</li>
    <li> I like it, purchased a few weeks ago. Hair feels softer, do not feel the need to wash it as much. Not a bad price also.</li>
    <li> This is a really luxurious brush</li>
    <li> It works fine. It has an odd feel to it and the bristles are not uniform.  Potential Amazon Basic item...</li>
    <li> I was tired of having my hair break off all of the time with blow drying and brushing and read that the best brush to buy was a boar bristle brush.  I had read good reviews about how shiny it made your hair and decided to give it a try.  I love it!  My hair is shinier, softer and absolutely no static or fly away.  My boyfriend has long hair and he tried it and his hair is much softer and shinier as well.  Product came on time and works as promised.  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This brush is great.  My husband has been looking for a good size brush for a long time and this fits the bill. He loves it. He liked the first one I bought that I just bought another one to keep in his travel bag</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the quality of this brush. I was expecting some cheap crap where all the bristles would fall out on the first use. I use this brush everyday and it hasn&#x27;t lost a single bristle. I like the hardwood paddle construction. This is a high quality item, I expect it will outlast me.</li>
    <li> Nice brush.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I really like the brush and it&#x27;s not too harsh on my hair.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of growing out my hair. I hated washing it so frequently, and when it became tangled constantly, I was at a loss. Finally my friends with long hair told me to get a boar bristle brush. Now, I really can&#x27;t help BUT brush my hair when I am at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair impossibly soft, manageable, and it really does evenly distribute the oil over my hair. I absolutely love this brush and I have no idea how I grew my hair so long and never got a brush like this.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great brush. Nice wood and the bristles feel great on my scalp. These types of brushes are not for styling your hair but to condition your scalp and that&#x27;s what this one does. The company is a great company to deal with if you have any concerns regarding your brush.  Might I suggest - if you have any problems with your brush contact the company before you just leave negative responses. And do some research before buying this type of brush - that will lead you to a more satisfactory purchase. I don&#x27;t work for this company but I have had good responses from them.</li>
    <li> This brush has a good wide area, but it is quite firm, which means if you have short hair, your scalp will feel it.  It&#x27;s a good brush.</li>
    <li> Great firm bristles and wide platform.</li>
    <li> this good for all hair types&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words i had received these product in return for my review</li>
    <li> I love this brush, my hair has never been so shiny and soft! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Durable brush,  I wish the bristles were longer for my thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the brush 3 stars bc the brush has an awful smell. It smells of strong adhesive/chemicals.</li>
    <li> A really excellent hairbrush, firm but very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This is my first boar brush, I think it&#x27;s a good brush I just didn&#x27;t like what it did to my hair. I got it because I heard they were good for naturally curly hair. It makes my hair flat on top and frizzy on the bottom.</li>
    <li> No problems, as it should be.</li>
    <li> Keep a &#x27;High &amp; Tight&#x27; haircut.  This brush is perfect for stimulating the scalp.</li>
    <li> Great job. Prompt packaging and delivery.  Extremely satisfied</li>
    <li> Really great product, sturdy and I really like the way it makes my hair feel.  Very smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent example of a well built hair brush.  Everything about it is first class and its a great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry if you purchase this item</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. Work as advertised and make my hair shine. Will recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> The brush was bigger than I thought but it feels great. And it makes brushing a fast snap due to its size.</li>
    <li> Received it quickly and I love it.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Nice sturdy handle, the bristle leave my hair shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> Great for DRY hair, I would not recommend this on wet hair if you have thin hair like me ! Made my hair soft and shiny ! definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> All I expected and more</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my 25 year old Mason Pearson brush and am quite satisfied at a fraction of the cost with the GranNaturals bristle brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush and well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for my thick, curly hair. It&#x27;s large and the bristles are stiff enough to make my hair more manageable. The delivery was timely, and the customer service is good as well. I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Great product, exactly what I was looking for. Inexpensive and came quickly.</li>
    <li> Had a terrible time finding a guy hairbrush for my husband. This one is great. He loves the bristles and uses it daily.</li>
    <li> I am not satisfied with this brush at all. I tried to brush through my hair and it would not touch my scalp as another review had mention.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sad when it comes to trying out things and being disappointed. I have tried a boar bristle brush before and this did not come close to it. For the longest time i always wanted to have my very own boar bristle brushe at an affordable price but this didn&#x27;t really grip through my hair. The one who I have tried was when a hair style was doing my hair too bad I didn&#x27;t look at the brand. But after she brushed my hair it was felt so nice soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like this brush was just petting my hair. Not much grip of hair was caught onto the bristle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it one star but I liked the style of it. I really wanted to love this brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair brush with lovely stiff brittles and high quality. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was that it does flatten your volume out, so please be forewarned. But it&#x27;s a quality product and extremely well made!</li>
    <li> Misleading description of product. Quite stiff as opposed to its description. Nice wood handle but the hairs are not soft s listed.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair brush, bristles have not shown any signs of falling out, sturdy handle, great design, all around good product.</li>
    <li> This brush hurts my kid so much - very course brush/bristles. Pulls out a lot of hair.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Overall good brush for the purpose. It is big.Really big be aware of dimensions if you are accostomed to a particular brush body. The bristles are very short and do not &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; or conform when you use it. For my use they could have been another length longer but are acceptable. Just use care on sensitive scalp.</li>
    <li> I like the brush it makes my hair soft but doesn&#x27;t make it easier to put up in a ponytail.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> Great brush and wonderful price!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and I use this brush and we have very different hair types (very thin and very thick).  We both like it.  It helps with scalp stimulation in my opinion and gives you a good head scratch when brushing.  Good quality handle, does not feel cheap at all.  Bristles have not fallen out of the brush either.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush-feels good on the  scalp and puts my hair where I want it to be. I have short hair so it does not challenge the brush too much.</li>
    <li> Good for smooth shiny hair and slicked back hair</li>
    <li> If I was a horse I would love this brush. It would also be good for stripping varnish from an old door.</li>
    <li> 1 returned the brush. It was described as soft, I found it stiff and uncomfortable on my head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for just two days and already I can see and feel a difference in the health of my hair! I have thick, curly hair, and this brush is wonderful for natural oil distribution from my scalp down the hair follicles which helps my hair from being dry and damaged. My hair is so much softer and shinier since I&#x27;ve begun using this brush, which is wonderful! This is a wonderful brush which is very well made, and I&#x27;m sure will last me a long time!</li>
    <li> I just don&#x27;t feel my hair gets combed well - not deep enough - don&#x27;t like it</li>
    <li> A little rougher than I expected but does a good job</li>
    <li> Works great. I have thick hair so I brush my hair in segments to make sure I get everything. It definitely helps distribute the oils from root to end so that my ends don&#x27;t look so dry. I read the reviews before buying and I saw one stating that the bristles fell out after one use, but that hasn&#x27;t been the case with me at all. It&#x27;s really holding up well against my thick hair. The ordering process was super simple and I received my brush within two days even though I just opted for standard shipping. Would definitely do business with this company again.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush because I can feel it stimulating my scalp while I&#x27;m brushing and afterwards. It only gets four stars because it does seem to cause a lot of static in my hair.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Great transaction. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Well constructed brush. bristles a little stiffer than I had imagined but overall, I am quite satisfied. Shipping was excellent. Item arrived quickly and was well packaged</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy, well-constructed brush. The bristles are affixed securely and are dense. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Good quality hairbrush. Good experience, would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> We would love to suggest using a hemp bag for packaging as plastic is toxic and we have cut enough trees down on this planet!</li>
    <li> Product came in a damaged box and looked as if it was either used or had terrible quality. Also there are slightly more nylon pieces than boar bristles. Returning.  Not going to rebuy.</li>
    <li> This was a great product and I received it in a timely manner. I would order from this seller again. Great job.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, long hair. It&#x27;s full bodied, but the strands are about a halfway point between fine and thick. This brush does not glide through my hair. It&#x27;s only good for superficial brushing (the top layer of my hair), but it will not penetrate to my scalp and brush the buried sections of my hair. A good quality brush for those with finer/less hair, but not for me.</li>
    <li> my son loves this brush</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it. He assumed it was an expensive brush based on the quality.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. Well made. Bristles are little stiff for me but that&#x27;s my fault for ordering that version. Wife has long hair so she&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> Not sure about this brush. It came with a strange,  strong rubber odor. I haven&#x27;t used it yet due to the odor. Trying to air it out. Will update later.</li>
    <li> Recently, I remembered that my grandmother always swore by natural boar bristle brushes. She had amazing hair her whole life. This brush is of excellent quality. The bristles are not too hard and not too soft. I noticed an immediate improvement in the shine of my hair and my scalp feels really great after brushing. I&#x27;m hoping this will also help with my thinning hair issues. I will report back if I see an improvement over time. Meanwhile, I am very pleased with this brush regardless as to whether or not it can help with the thinning issues.</li>
    <li> Really great brush and even better customer service.</li>
    <li> Really nice quality brush...  gentle and wont break your hair!  I have long fine hair, and nearly all brushes tend to break my hair... my hair tangles so easily and plastic brushes tend to break my hair.  The size is really nice, and the bristles are very full and work well on wet or dry hair.  By the way, when I used a plastic brush my hair poofs (static) but when I used this one that didn&#x27;t happen...</li>
    <li> I love this brush and the quality is comparable to a more expensive brush but for way less! Another major plus is the attention to each order by the company, in which they ensure each item from them is to your standards and will do what they can to make you happy. I am absolutely buying more from them !</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say that it is real boars hair or not, no expert here but it seems like it. Not too hard or too soft but the bristles fall out every other time you use it. You&#x27;ll see one or two hanging around in your hair or on the counter</li>
    <li> This brush is coarse, it gets to those stubborn itches below the surface of your beard, and nicely combs the top layer of hair on my head. I like the smoothness I get from the hair after I brush, and my beard looks tamed and groomed after brushing. As long as the bristles stay intact, this is a 5-star purchase.</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair and I was hoping that this would be able to reach my scalp with its bristles to give my hair some illusion of body&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t reach to my scalp  nor pick up all the hair within one stroke of the brush. It is however very well made.</li>
    <li> Great product and customer service</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are a bit more rigid than other boar bristle brushes I&#x27;ve owned, but they feel great on my scalp. I&#x27;ve seen other reviews that said the bristles aren&#x27;t natural- I assure you, my brush is natural. There is a slight chemical odor to the brush, it comes from the mesh used to anchor the bristles. I imagine after a few washes the smell will fade- but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not transferring to my hair...and since I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy sniffing my hair brush I&#x27;m not too worried about this. I think the thing to remember is that although this cost a little more than a standard drugstore hairbrush- this is a boar bristle brush. You could easily drop $250 on a hand crafted boar bristle brush that is perfect in every way. Or... You can spend $13 on a boar bristle brush that has a faint odor. I&#x27;ve had several brushes in this price range and I assure you, none have been perfect and this one is just as good if not better than the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> While I still will use my normal brush for detangling my hair, I bought this brush because my hair was looking flat and dry.  In 2 days of use, my hair looks shiny and lively again!  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is more than a hair brush, it is a scalp brush, giving it a serious scratching -- just what I wanted.  The quality is good -- for the price.</li>
    <li> i have thick hair and this does not cut it. i really have to brush my hair in sections just to get the tangles out and for the brush to really do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. i know the description says works for all hair types: long, thin, thick, normal . . . i am one disappointed buyer</li>
    <li> Did not go through my hair.</li>
    <li> The item description states 100% boar bristles but is a combo with thick plastic bristles.</li>
    <li> BEST BRUSH EVER!!!! It smooths, de tangles, does not break hair. I had a Denman boars hair paddle brush and bought this brush because while I was cleaning the Denman I accidentally pull a lot of the bristles out rendering it unusable...and glad I did. I LOVE this brush. If you need a paddle brush and want the best, get this one &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Excellent brush - bristles are hard/stiff just what I wanted</li>
    <li> This brush is as described and made very nicely. It really does make my hair smoother and shinier. I have shorter hair and it works great. I will definitely be using it before leaving the house. I believe it would work just as well no matter the length of your hair and it would work well on many hair types.</li>
    <li> Great product and super fast service!</li>
    <li> My daughter has long, wavy hair and absolutely hates brushing it. I have bought several different types of brushes and combs (at all different prices) to find one that she can tolerate. I got one of these for her and she really likes it. She has used it on her hair both wet &amp; dry and it gets her tangles out effortlessly. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> A little too stiff for my taste</li>
    <li> Great brush, I have really thick hair and it tends to frizz, but when I use this brush it smooths the hair follicle and looks shiney.</li>
    <li> Great size and great shape! Not too heavy either!!</li>
    <li> Product as advertised and it was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> This item works great on my daughters hair. It is a bit difficult to brush my hair because of the thickness of my hair.</li>
    <li> This brush is beautifully made and will definitely stimulate the scalp when used.  I am very happy with it.  I also went ahead and ordered the Argan oil from this company because the quality of the brush lets me know that the oil will also be top quality.</li>
    <li> This appears well made. The bristle area is appx. 3&amp;#34;x4&amp;#34;, curve-mounted in a flexible rubber (plastic?) substrate mounted in a nicely grained  relatively slim hardwood handle which fits my extra-large hands comfortably, but would also be comfortable for smaller hands. It is, I think, primarily &amp;#34;tip bristles&amp;#34; (I&#x27;m no boar-bristle expert)- which is desirable. The bristles are substantially stiff-  unlike a basic &amp;#34;big box&amp;#34; B-B brush from my experience; you ladies with more/longer hair than I might find this desirable for &amp;#34;brushing out&amp;#34; your longer locks and distributing oils. I use this on my beard and am very satisfied with it (...don&#x27;t have much hair left on pate...)</li>
    <li> My hair is really damaged at the moment, and this brush is perfectly gentle. I&#x27;ll definitely still be using it long after I get my hair healthy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product. It came very quickly. It seems to be the only thing that is taming my frizz.</li>
    <li> This is a sturdy brush and for the price it is a great deal, highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I wish there was a plastic wrap around the bristles but that&#x27;s just me being picky. I love how solid the handle feels, and it seems like it will last for years to come! I also love that they added in argan oil for free during this promotion. This is my first experience from Gran Goods and I love them. I will be buying from them again!</li>
    <li> My sister ordered this brush and I used it a couple times. She really loves it and uses it after she showers or when shes just brushing it.So far it feels like a well made brush.</li>
    <li> I love this brush!  It brings a nice shine to my hair and doesn&#x27;t break my hair like other brushes.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brush! Love it!</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery and a good product.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend was here when my boar bristle brush was delivered so when I opened the package, I let her try it.  She swiped her long hair about 3 times and I couldn&#x27;t believe how shiny it was where she brushed.  I made her go into the bathroom and brush to see for herself.  When she came out her hair was shining all over--she could see the difference, too.  It was also laying better as if the hair had calmed down.</li>
    <li> Nice solid brush just what i needed for my beard.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush and just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This brush is just what I was looking for. I am using it on our dog and it makes her hair shine and she loves the feel of the brush.</li>
    <li> I was told to get a boar bristle brush because they bring out the shine in your hair so I decided to try it. I use a different brush to brush my hair and style it and then I use this to brush a little after I&#x27;m done and I have to say, it definitely improves the texture and shine of my hair so I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
    <li> This comb is good for thick course hair. I combed my daughters hair with it and she loves it.</li>
    <li> Delivery on time. This is my first time to use boar bristle paddle hair brush. Everything is good , but just one thing is not good enought--the chemical smell,  hope it can progress anyway.</li>
    <li> Pretty disappointed.  The bristles aren&#x27;t long enough to even touch my scalp!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush!!! Would definitely te purchase!!!</li>
    <li> I looooove this brush. I actually bought 3 different brands to try and this was by far the best. The bristles are much harder than others, and the varying sizes helps to smooth hair. These brushes do make your hair static-y, but I store mine with a dryer sheet and it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> great high quality brush</li>
    <li> Fantastic brush. The boar bristles really seem to tame my husband&#x27;s cowlicks. Outstanding brush.</li>
    <li> My dad loves this brush. He&#x27;s kinda old so he digs products that were around when he was young in the stone age. He&#x27;s been brushing the heck out of his skullet with this brush and loves it. He says it&#x27;s soft on his mostly bald head and leaves the few sprigs of hair left feeling soft all day. He talks about this brush every time we speak, so that&#x27;s nice. I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
    <li> exactly as described...super quality.</li>
    <li> My hair is so soft after using this boat bristle brush. I&#x27;ve just been using a comb for years. Missing out on all the terrific benefits of a boat bristle brush!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hairbrush and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. It had maybe a dozen bristles fall out when first used and then no more. The bristles (which do not have those horrendous balls on the end) are dense and leave my hair with zero static and a great shine. My scalp is massaged very well and the brush, with its wooden handle and dark bristles, is beautiful to see and display. My reason for not giving this brush 5 stars is that I would want the bristles to be a 1/16 inch longer, the brush handle to be about 1/2 inch longer so it&#x27;s easier to hold with the paddle itself about 1/2 narrower. (I&#x27;m a woman with short hair which has changed texture as it has become 70% silver)</li>
    <li> I replaced my faithful boar hair brush that I got in Germany with this one from GranNaturals. It is really great and smooth; to be honest it is even better than my old one.</li>
    <li> This is my first time leaving a review from a purchase from Amazon but I love this brush! I&#x27;ve always wanted a boar bristle brush but because I had a wooden comb, I didn&#x27;t feel like I needed to splurge and get another one especially because my hair is so pin straight that I don&#x27;t really need to brush anyways. However, this brush makes my hair so soft and shiny, love the smooth wooden handle, and massages my scalp. The only problem is that I wish it is able to &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; onto more hair when I brush because I have pretty thick hair. The reason this item also gets 5 stars is a personalized message from Mark himself from Gran Goods! I really appreciate a personalized message that checks up to see if I like my item which saves me the hassle of searching how to contact the company when it is a terrible item. I like it so much that I would buy each of my sisters (4!) one of these if there was a discount for a bundle package ;)!</li>
    <li> Thick bristles, sturdy construction, and lovely wood handle. I love it. I will probably order more for my family.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Best brush I ever owned. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> Good brush at a good price - hair stylist recommended a natural Boar bristle brush</li>
    <li> This brush was exactly what I was looking for and the price was excellent.</li>
    <li> Good quality brush for the price, as expected, the bristles are tough so go easy on your face and head. Product arrived on time as expected.</li>
    <li> This brush has a unique smell even after a few months of owning it. I purchased it for my teen but she doesn&#x27;t care for the bristles...she does have a tender head. I enjoy a good brushing of the scalp for an invigorating feeling. I just don&#x27;t care for the odor.</li>
    <li> Very good product. Fast shipping. I would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My Husband Loves it... firm bristles soothes his scalp</li>
    <li> The quality of the bristle is excellent. It&#x27;s a great brush. The only issue I have is that it has a strong, almost smoky, smell. I only just got it, so I&#x27;m hoping it will fade.</li>
    <li> This brush is great. Everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Very good quality brush, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Great brush for my beard.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery of a good-quality, well-priced brush. The brush&#x27;s surface has a light curve, good for long hair, gently disentangling the hair without tearing it. Bristles are short, stiff, and dense.</li>
    <li> Needed a boar bristle brush for my longer beard. Seems to do it&#x27;s job as far as spreading oils evenly throughout the hair. Nice stiff bristles. Only downside is the very strong oder from the brush when you unwrap it from it&#x27;s packaging. It eventually lessens over time but doesn&#x27;t seem to go away completely.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and is durable and seems well made!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this brush. I don&#x27;t believe it is 100% boar hair but it makes my hair so smooth and makes my scalp feel good!</li>
    <li> Great brush! Makes my scalp feel happy and my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a tender head grandchild. She loves it. Doesn&#x27;t pull tangles. It had a terrible smell when we opened the package but&lt;br /&gt;I washed it then left it out to breathe and its seems better. I would use this seller again.</li>
    <li> A really good stiff hair brush</li>
    <li> The brush is exactly as pictured. It made my hair feel nice and soft. Gran Goods provided excellent service, informing me when the product shipped and when to expect it to arrive. They also contacted me to make sure I was satisfied with the product. Incredible service!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing brush and it arrived so quick!!!</li>
    <li> I never realized the benefits to these types of brushes until recently, learning that they are used to distribute oil from the scalp to the ends of your hair. I use multiple oil treatments on my scalp for plaque psoriasis and have noticed, over the past year, that my hair was not the same. My hair is long, very thick, coarse, and curly (loose). My curls were taming to the point where my hair only had a soft wave in it and it was very heavy at the top and roots due to my natural oil build up. For as long as I can remember the ends of my hair have looked like weeds- coarse, erratic, and frizzy.  Since I&#x27;ve started using this brush my hair has regained it&#x27;s curliness, which I take great pride in because I get a lot of compliments for my natural hair, and the ends are starting to soften up. They&#x27;re slowly becoming smoother and less frizzy. I use the palm of my free hand on the other side of my hair, sandwiching the hair against the brush, to stroke all the way through to the ends my hair. It&#x27;s extremely easy to clean; remove all hair from the brush, swirl the brush in a bowl of warm water and shampoo for a few minutes, rinse, place face down on a towel to dry. Generally, you need to clean it once a week to prevent putting old oil back into your hair.</li>
    <li> Just what she wanted/needed.  Seems to be well made, didn&#x27;t have any particular odor to it, and the bristles (whether &#x27;genuine boar&#x27; or not) have just the right firmness for her particular hair texture.  Plus of course the price was right, and it shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> First time bought my self a hair brush. I would say I am happy with quality and result. Thank you !</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get used to brushing with this boar bristle hair brush. My hair is thick and find it difficult to brush thoroughly as the bristles barely reach the scalp. I wish that they could make a hybrid of sorts. A hair brush that would have sturdier but semi flexible bristles (similar to the Denman brush) incorporated to help massage the scalp for better circulation as well as the boar bristles to make hair shinier and healthier.... I&#x27;ll be very interested.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too short for me.  I have no use for it.</li>
    <li> Does a great job of making my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter who has very long thick hair. She loves it. Her hair is smooth and soft. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> It really smoothes my hair back. The bristles feel really rough and they tickle my scalp whenever it touches it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m completely happy with this brush. It&#x27;s a great value, and though I&#x27;ve never owned one of the extremely high-end versions (think $200+), I can&#x27;t imagine them being better and worth the exorbitant cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first boars hair paddle brush since I was a child and now I see why my mom bought them.</li>
    <li> The hairbrush arrived extremely quickly as part of my Amazon order. I&#x27;ve never had a hairbrush like this before. So far I like it.</li>
    <li> Very much enjoy the brush.  Very good value....</li>
    <li> Bleached blonde hair is looking so much better when I use this before I shower. The oils of the scalp get pulled through the rest of my hair, making is stronger looking, glossier. My little ones like to brush my hair at night, this is great and feels great.</li>
    <li> No major complaints with this purchase. I have short, fine hair but a lot of it so it can appear to be somewhat thick. It does take a little bit of effort to get the bristles all the way to my scalp, so I just work in sections. Occasionally I get a little static, and occasionally I get a bristle that falls out. I&#x27;ve never used a boar bristle brush before, I know some people that have and their hair always looked amazing and healthy, but I&#x27;ve got nothing to compare to as far as if this is a good brush compared to what else is out there. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my hair yet.</li>
    <li> Nice, very sturdy brush.  Delivered very quickly and in perfect condition as promised. I would buy again from GranNaturals....thank you!</li>
    <li> Was not pleased at all with the quality of this brush...it had such a strong Oder of chemicals I had to throw out..was not natural boar..had to have synthetic material for that strong of smell..</li>
    <li> Nice quality brush.  Not for those with sensitive skin, it is rough on your head at first.</li>
    <li> I should have gotten a stiffer brush. I don&#x27;t like the way the poofy part of the paddle gives way as i brush my hair. The quality is nice though.</li>
    <li> Feels like a quality item. Thanks for the fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This brush is great for the &amp;#34;No Poo Movement&amp;#34;! It&#x27;s gentle on hair, and doesn&#x27;t scratch your scalp. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I have straight, fine hair and this brush untangles it without pulling. I recommend it. Also, the Gran Goods team demonstrated commitment to customer service, which I appreciate very much.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is very stimulating to my scalp and it makes my hair shiny.</li>
    <li> good brush, good follow up on product.</li>
    <li> My hair is in much better shape. Very soft and more manageable. The big thing is that the boar bristles help spread your natural oils from scalp to ends. Not great for de-tangling though, you have to keep at it.</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted and expected to be. Bought this for my husband and he loved it. Thank you Gran Goods!</li>
    <li> Works great. My hair is so soft. Great service. Ordered Saturday night and had it before noon on Monday.</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  Brush is good quality with strong bristles.  Delivered very quickly.</li>
    <li> Very nice, sturdy hairbrush! Good size and durable bristles. Note, I have really thick,long hair so for those of you who with a similar hair type, don&#x27;t expect this to get through it like a regular hairbrush, because it wont. I find it works best as a finishing brush on dry hair, after detangling with a comb, to help spread oils from the scalp through the hair.</li>
    <li> It is to stiff, the old one was soft.</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH,  BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality brush - definitely a great value!  A few things I love:&lt;br /&gt; - brush is made out of natural materials&lt;br /&gt; - firm bristles that effectively detangle and make the hair shine vs. the soft bristles that don&#x27;t brush out tangles&lt;br /&gt; - wide brush that covers more hair at a time vs. the typical skinny brushes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I think this is a great brush!</li>
    <li> I love the way this brush made my hair feel. It left my hair soft and shiney. It&#x27;s very gently for getting snarls out of your hair. The only con, is that it sometimes felt as though it wasn&#x27;t getting completely through my hair. It felt as though it was only getting through the top layer.</li>
    <li> Does not work well with long or thickish hair. The bristles are VERY short, barely touches my scalp. Definitely does not get the tangles out of mine or my girls&#x27; hair. On the bright side, it does make your hair very smooth. I would like to try another sometime, with longer bristles, but I&#x27;m still not too sure it would help at all with tangles...</li>
    <li> Been using this brush for a week and I love it!  My hair feels so much smoother.</li>
    <li> The brush us great!  It has a comfortable feel when brushing my grandaughters hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush! Feels great brushing my hair and my hair looks healthier after using it.</li>
    <li> Very nice brush. Wooden handle and boar bristles. its a good size and my daughter has no trouble brushing her curly hair with this brush.</li>
    <li> Great quality brush. Very good for fine hair, bristles are close.</li>
    <li> I love how smooth this makes my hair!</li>
    <li> great quality, bristles are very stiff and hard .</li>
    <li> Brush is ok however it came with a funny smell which I am trying to take away. Any ideas?  Thanks</li>
    <li> loved this brush..it works really well!</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully to tame my thick hair. It detangles fast too. Saved me a lot of hassle today!</li>
    <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I actually received a compliment on my hair the first day I started using this brush, so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> I use paddle hair brushes with this type of bristle because they are easy on my sensitive scalp.  This is an equal to the normal Aveda model I purchase, if not better.  It leaves the same texture in your hair and it does it in a softer manner.  Next time I order, I&#x27;m getting two.  Good job!</li>
    <li> My sister ordered this brush and I used it a couple times. She really loves it and uses it after she showers or when shes just brushing it. I used it when my hair was dry, I have really thick hair so it left nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were at least 1/4 inch longer.  The present length makes them too stiff.  This is a very painful brush to use.</li>
    <li> Great  brush, my husband really likes this kind of brush. Feels good on the scalp and does the job.  4stars because it was a little larger than expected.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny! I really love this brush and the round boar brush I bought at the same time</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Absolutely love it. Does exactly what it says.</li>
    <li> Bigger and stiffer than we thought, but good enough.</li>
    <li> This is such a crappy brush. I am 17 years old, and I have long, thick hair. I want to grow my hair out incredibly long so I can cut and donate it. If I want to do so, I must have healthy hair. Boar bristle brushes are extremely good for hair, so I bought one. This one sucks. This is NOT for all hair types. The bristles are so short, making it impossible to efficiently brush thick hair. If you are looking into this brush, do not purchase it unless you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> if you have a head of hair this brush is great--large size</li>
    <li> This is a great quality brush.  Seems well made and it feels so great on the scalp.  Perfect for massaging those veins for healthy hair roots.</li>
    <li> Works great on my and my daughters hair. It does have a funky smell at first but goes away. Very gentle brush.</li>
    <li> Although I have yet to use this hairbrush, I am sure that one day soon it will meet and perhaps even go beyond my expectations.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a nice flat paddle brush like this for some time.  The bristles are fine and firm - perfect for their intended use.  I plan on using my GranNaturals Boar Bristle Paddle Hair Brush regularly and with great vigor in the near future.  Thank you for creating such a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Great replacement brush!</li>
    <li> The brush works very well and was shipped in a timely manner. Its comfortable to hold and use and is very lightweight while still being able to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Good quality, have not had an issue since purchase. Quick shipping as well.</li>
    <li> The brush had a string chemical smell. I had tried washing it and left it outdoor for few days to get rid of thr smell. Still made me wonder what chemical was in use and if I  really want to brush my hair with this. Once I dared brush my hair, I found out it was too weak. Hardly went thru and brushed the surface only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush since the past two months now. Firstly I would say that the Customer care service is excellent. About the brush - its study and has no smell. I haven&#x27;t washed it so far so don&#x27;t know. Well I have very dry and frizzy hair and it does tame the frizziness quite a bit and makes my hair look less kinky.The brush is of good quality and value for money.&lt;br /&gt;It does not change the hair type .As far as the oil distribution is concerned I have extremely dry hair and perhaps is not secreting the kind of oil it should. Thus the ends still look dry and slightly unruly however the crown looks much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I noticed is that I do have a lot of hair breaking and sticking inside the brush, I already have very thin hair and it pains me to see it break. Maybe I need to be more gentle while brushing , i&#x27;m applying a lot of friction and hence maybe its breaking off.However I will again update in few months. Hope this helps to others.</li>
    <li> excellent quality - as advertised</li>
    <li> I needed a beard brush.  This is a very large paddle brush.  The bristles are nice and firm.  It will help soften your hair and massaging your face under your hair.</li>
    <li> This brush did not work for my hair. I tried brushing smaller sections or changing my brushing style but the dense short bristles just pushed my hair down onto my scalp instead of lifting and brushing it. May work better for men or anyone with shorter hair. Great quality brush just did not work for me</li>
    <li> A nice large brush.  No loose bristles.  The wood has a pleasing grain.  The quality of this brush exceeds the price.  Can readily double as a spanking paddle in a pinch.</li>
    <li> A very sturdy well made brush. Large and fits well in my hand. Only wish I have.. I would like the bristles to be just a tad bit longer so it would pick up more hair at one time. I have long straight hair and although it works well. I have to separate my hair into smaller sections to brush through it completely.</li>
    <li> The brush is fabulous. It really detangles and smooths out my hair from root to ends. My only complaint would be it has a bit of a smell, but that seems to be going away.</li>
    <li> My fiance uses this brush on his beard and I&#x27;ve caught him brushing a few times in one day. He loves it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my lady and it does wonders for her hair. Bristles are a perfect balance of firm/soft.</li>
    <li> This brush is FANTASTIC!!  Exactly what I was hoping for when purchasing.  Beautiful product and works well.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to tame my toddlers wild curly locks; this brush contains real boar bristles and does an amazing job! It&#x27;s of excellent quality and if I ever lose this brush... Which sometimes happens in my house... I will be buying another one!</li>
    <li> Service and deliver were super great and fast!!! The bristles on the brush are a bit short and so it seems as though I am not really brushing through my hair- just on top of it. So it sucks bc I have to find a new brush. I can&#x27;t remember whether or not the length of the bristles was in the description...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway great service though!</li>
    <li> I love this bristle brush! Most bristle brushes I&#x27;ve had in the past shed, but this one is great! I haven&#x27;t noticed any of the bristles falling out in the few months I&#x27;ve been using it. It works great at moving the oils throughout your hair shaft. I have very long hair &amp; just section my hair off &amp; run the brush through from root to tip &amp; I can visibly see that the oil from my scalp is moved down the full shaft of the hair. It makes my hair SOOO soft after using this. My hair has never been healthier!</li>
    <li> My son has naturally curly hair and It&#x27;s oil in the front where it&#x27;s limp and straight like his dad&#x27;s hair, and dry and frizzy in the back like my hair. I use this to move his natural oils from the front of his hair to the back.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! Exactly what I wanted and arrived before I expected.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I find this brush completely useless, and no one I&#x27;ve offered it to has been interested, non plus.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have a lot of thick hair, but it offers no penetration whatsoever.  In other words, the brush just touches the outer layer of my hair without doing anything.  It feels like a flat surface against my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t come anywhere near my scalp.  The brush does absolutely nothing for me.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look the least bit different and does nothing to disentangle any potential snarls or even separate any individual strands of hair.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I&#x27;ve always had plastic ones in the past, but finally traded up.  What a difference--wish I had done this ages ago.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, it does a good job gettin g tangles out of the strange fur like stuff on top of her head. She runs this wand with tiny fingers through it and wah lah! Straight flawless hair! Miracle brush!</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my husband as he badly needed a new hairbrush.  He prefers the boar bristles to plastic ones  and this brush is just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The price was right too!</li>
    <li> I like the brush. If I had measured, I probably would have gotten something smaller for my toddler to use but it works as expected nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality brush.  It feels wonderful to brush with, and does a great job of pulling the natural oils in my hair away from my scalp all the way to the ends.  I would highly recommend this brush to anyone that likes stiff bristle brushes.</li>
    <li> Great brush for my beard and excellent customer service. The seller shipped the brush the same day I ordered it. I definitely recommend this brush for anyone needing to tame unruly facial hair.</li>
    <li> I wish I had this brush when my hair was long!  I always had plastic brushes then, and they just do not distribute the oils and massage the scalp the way this brush does.  Now that my hair is short, I usually just use a comb or my fingers.  But just a few swipes with the Gran Naturals Boar Bristle Paddle makes my scalp feel wonderful and spreads the oils evenly through my hair.  I can wash my hair every other day because it does not look so greasy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bit big and clunky.  Bristles are short so it seems to only smooth down the top layer of hair.  I&#x27;ll keep trying it and maybe will become more accustomed to its feel.  Overall, I&#x27;m not entirely disappointed, but am not overly excited about it either.</li>
    <li> I found the brush a little big, but the bristle&#x27;s are ok for someone with fine hair. I would not recommend for anybody with thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my husband. He really loves it! He has a medium amount of hair on top, but at times will let it grow to almost shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says the brush is easy &amp; comfortable to use. I took a few swipes through my hair with it so I know the grip is comfortable for both men and women&#x27;s hands. The paddle is very attractive and made of quality wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also commented he feels it stimulates his scalp. His hair does look shinier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a high quality item with the wooden handle and boar bristles versus plastic. I am sure it will last my husband many years!!</li>
    <li> There are a couple of natural bristles (maybe boar) the rest is nylon, you can tell because the bristles are blunt and shiny. There is a chemical smell and without even using it, some bristles have already fallen out in shipping.The quality overall is poor. Perhaps this is a fake of a good quality brush by this brand? Will attempt to return. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The brush is huge and great.  It feels amazing on the scalp, and I&#x27;ve also really enjoyed using it in my beard.  It pulls through tangles and leaves everything soft and fluffed.  Absolutely terrific product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> The brush does it&#x27;s job well but the paddle I received has a two large discolorations or plugs on it. One on the front below the bristle pad and one on the back just above the handle.</li>
    <li> Excellent boars&#x27; hair brush with comfortable handle.  Very stiff on first brushing, but quickly becomes comfortably stiff and brushes my (male, medium cut) hair and gently massages the scalp.  It is (as advertised) wide, and I like it that way.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Great communication.  Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Love this brush. It feels so good on my scalp and  I&#x27;m so glad that I gave it a try. I&#x27;m letting my hair grow out pretty long and want to take great care of it. This was a great purchase!</li>
    <li> Yes the brush work&#x27;s great!I bought it for my  Grandaughter,her hair is very thick. Thankyou</li>
    <li> So far it feels like a well made brush.  Definitely cuts down on some frizziness.  Im satisfied with the purchase</li>
    <li> Works great on my short hair and feels like you&#x27;re getting a head massage at the same time.  Well made.</li>
    <li> Volumizes to the MAX. It&#x27;s unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever used before- absolutely amazing! Love the all natural hair of the brush. It doesn&#x27;t pull like a normal brush would. Makes knots a thing of the past. I would absolutely reccomend to anyone with long, short, or in between hair.</li>
    <li> Like others said, the bristles are too short to brush from scalp through my hair.  I have thin, fine hair and thought it would work well, but even with my hair, the bristles just weren&#x27;t long enough.  Otherwise, the brush is made well.  Will use if for my short haired dog.</li>
    <li> This brush is amazing! No more plastic bristles damaging your hair! Slick, smooth high quality brush!</li>
    <li> Great price and fast delivery. Have been looking for a boar brush for ever.</li>
    <li> Works well however the bristles are sort of rough. Won&#x27;t use it on my 2 yr old daughter but for me ok.</li>
    <li> I was excited to buy this because it was an all natural brush. It has a scent to it but is like a newness scent which I think will likely fade over time. I have super thick hair and it&#x27;s long. It is ok but worked much better on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is shorter and thinner than mine. It glides through her hair and seems to work well. It doesn&#x27;t pull and made her hair feel smoother and softer. Overall, I liked it but for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
    <li> I really like it so far. It is very durable and strong enough to help stretch and style naturally curly hair. I like using it before doing ponytails and using curlformers</li>
    <li> The bristles and shape are as pictured, which is good. My only complaint is the smell. There&#x27;s a strong burnt rubber smell, presumably from the bristle backing, that hasn&#x27;t aired out, so I&#x27;m going to try washing it. It doesn&#x27;t transfer to the hair while brushing thankfully, but I get a whiff of it every time I pick it up to use it. I can handle it but I don&#x27;t have any allergies or a super-sensitive nose, other&#x27;s may find it too much to bear.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent, very high quality brush.  The bristles are exactly the right length &amp;, not like my previous brush, the bristles do not come out.  Love it.  Thanks!!</li>
    <li> love this product, awesome</li>
    <li> 4 stars because the brush does smell a little funny, BUT it works great for smoothing hair and taming frizz!</li>
    <li> Very well made. Love the size!</li>
    <li> Got this for my 8 year old son and he loves it. All the other brushes hurt when he used them, this ones the ticket.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brush. I LOVE this product. I use this primarily as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; brush throughout the day, because in the morning, my thick hair tangles easily overnight and needs harder bristles to get through the knots. However, for the rest of the day this works perfectly to give it a soft, shiny just-brushed looked and is really easy on my hair-unlike other brushes which just seem to love tearing at it. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice brush. It&#x27;s large which makes the brushing go quickly.</li>
    <li> Quality product and graat customer service!</li>
    <li> This brush is nicely made.  Good strong bristles feels like a massage on your head as you comb.  The bristles are in tact and don&#x27;t shed as you brush.  I can see this brush lasting a long time.</li>
    <li> Love this brush and the seller is outstanding when it comes to communication!</li>
    <li> The brush smells.  I think it&#x27;s the plastic under the brisstles. I can describe the smell but I even tried washing the brush and it&#x27;s still horrible.  I will be returning the brush and if it&#x27;s not worth returning then it will be trashed.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  Bristles are firm and the brush is a good size.  Gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This brush is of good quality but the bristles are too short for my thick hair. It only brushes the top layer of my hair, so it is a lot of work to pick up my hair layber by layer to get it all done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a Boar brush before this so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect, but a friend of mine kept telling me how good they were for your scalp.  So I relented and got this one.  I am so glad I did!  It is a really good quality brush that glides through my hair and if I press just a little, I get a nice little massage on my scalp.  I am very pleased with this brush and I will be buying a few more as gifts.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent brush that was made with quality materials and craftsmanship. Not only that but the company as a whole is very customer centric and go to great lengths to ensure the customer is happy. I Highly recommend anyone to shop at Gran Goods and help support small businesses.</li>
    <li> Better than expected and prompt service</li>
    <li> I love my new brush and the customer service as great from Grans Goods. I will buy again, and I definitely recommend these vendors.</li>
    <li> I purchased that brush for elderly man who told me he could not find any type of bristle brush locally,iam shure he&#x27;ll be well pleased with this brush. I liked all the reviews is why bought this brush,plus the value.</li>
    <li> I had seen other reviews about the short bristles.  My hair, though long, is thin and fine, so I decided it would be ok.  As it turns out, the bristles really are just too short.  It takes extra work to brush properly to the scalp.  I love the feel of the brush...the nicely crafted wooden handle...the boar bristles.  With longer bristles, this would be a 5-star hairbrush.  If your hair is thin, fine, and short, then this is a great brush for you.</li>
    <li> great brush slides right threw you hair and makes it soft. would purchase again</li>
    <li> I should have heeded the less than favorable reviews on this product.  Near as I can tell, this brush is not 100% boar bristle.  When I fist got the brush, I ran my hands over the bristles.  About ten of them fell out in the sink, they were un-naturally v shaped, folded in half.  A natural hair, cannot be made to hold this shape, unless this is its natural shape.  Last I checked, boar bristles are straight.  Then there was the burn test, hair should ignite and go to a soft grey ash.  This curled back from the flame into a ball, that when crushed was very black like charcoal.  The brush makes my hair go very flat to my head and have a lot of static when touched.  The rubber pad, could be contributing to this.  The wood handle is nice.  This may have some boar bristles, but this benefit is lost due to the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; bristles.</li>
    <li> The bristles were falling to the floor the first use and I don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard these are great for your hair but I don&#x27;t feel like it really gets through my hair. The bristles aren&#x27;t very long and it feel like it only  brushes the top layer, so to brush my entire head, I have to do it in multiple sections. Not sure if that&#x27;s how all boar bristle brushes are or if its just this one.</li>
    <li> Nice brush good quality  fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love my GranNaturals Boar Bristle Paddle Hair Brush!  I have very fine, curly hair which is difficult to deal with naturally using the brush consistently has helped alleviate the frizzy short hairs that tend to stick up when I pull back my hair.  I&#x27;ve started brushing my hair with it for 5 or more minutes a night before bed and found that my hair is much softer and easier to handle.  The bristles are secure and I have not had an issue with them falling out of the brush.    When I received the brush, I noticed a musky smell that would transfer to my hair and fade within an hour.  This smell is assurance that the brush is made with natural boar bristles and eventually will completely fade from the brush the more you use it.  The smell is not offensive at all.  I highly recommend this brush if you have frizzy hair or just want softer hair naturally</li>
    <li> I like this hair bursh a lot. I was skeptical at first because it makes my hair frizzy but after a couple uses, my hair is now softer and smoother. my daughter likes how soft it is as well.</li>
    <li> This is NOT all boar bristle, it is about 50% nylon bristles. The inner bristles of each little cluster are nylon, and the outer are boar (or at least some kind of animal). I have included pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is INCREDIBLY static-causing. I am returning it immediately.</li>
    <li> This hairbrush has changed my life, I am now a lot more confident than I used to be because my hair is now much more soft and its naturally conditioned. I am so happy now</li>
    <li> I really like this brush! I wanted something natural, like boar bristles, to brush the oils through my hair. It feels wonderful on my scalp! A regular plastic brush doesn&#x27;t stimulate the hair folicals like this brush does. I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ll made product. The bristles were a little stiffer than I had anticipated. I assume they will soften with use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product it sure makes a difference for my frizzy hair. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great brush, easy detangling!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted when I ordered it.  Well made, appears to be ALL natural bristles.  Very happy with how it makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> very well made, works great and has made my hair much shinier and stronger</li>
    <li> I really like this brush, it is a great size and seems to work even better than my other boar hair brush. The handle is nice quality as well.</li>
    <li> Brush is very well made.  I have fragile hair so it&#x27;s used in the front and back of my hair for a smooth look.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great product!!</li>
    <li> Nice Brush-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a Nice Brush, it just didn&#x27;t work on my Hair Type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;F.E. Manuel</li>
    <li> Not for thick hair....I had to force it to brush all the way to the bottom layer of hair. I think it would be great for thin hair.</li>
    <li> Nice brush!!! I have long thick hair. The paddle is wide enough to smooth a good amount of my hair into a quick and neat ponytail.</li>
    <li> This is a really good brush it doesn&#x27;t just look expensive it performs like the high end brushes , I love everything about it ,I wouldn&#x27;t change a thing . It&#x27;s perfect, everyone can use it in your family it &#x27;s for all different hair types .</li>
    <li> This boar bristle brush is perfect for my hair.  It leaves it smooth and shiny and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp with hard bristles.  It is the perfect size.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have extremely thick hair so the brush doesn&#x27;t go all the way through but I discovered that if I use it to blow dry my hair in sections it works great.  It makes my hair so shiny and soft.</li>
    <li> I got this brush for a great deal. It is fantastic. No more crying when I brush my daughters hair.</li>
    <li> Brush is amazing!  It makes my hair super soft and shiny. I love the all wooden handle as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a boar bristle brush before. At first I was slightly dismayed at how short the bristles are. I didn&#x27;t think they would get through my thickish wavy hair...and I was right. But I did a little research and found that they aren&#x27;t supposed to. This type of brush is not intended for detangling. For that I use a very wide-toothed comb. What this brush is for is to distribute oils from the scalp down the length of the hair. This it does extremely well. The best way do accomplish this with my hair is to separate it into sections, and just brush one section at a time. I can&#x27;t get over how fantastic my hair feels after brushing in the evening and all the next day. I am attempting to get away from shampooing my hair daily which has left my hair in worse and worse shape the longer it gets. So the brush gets five stars. And so does the service. The brush arrived well packaged and in good shape in a much shorter time than I expected.</li>
    <li> Excellent hair brush.</li>
