      <li>I will definitely buy more</li>
      <li>They do exactly what they are meant to do</li>
      <li>First let me preface this by saying I&#x27;m the queen of matte.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> So pigmented and such good quality! I really love the colors. Very bright and a little goes a long way. My only complaint is that they are a little sticky and bleed a little. Good deal!</li>
    <li> colors are very pigmented and last a good length of time. not sticky at all</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by how nice these glosses are. I was a little worried because the price seemed a little too good to be true but they are actually really nice and last quite a while.</li>
    <li> better than lip tars! love!!!!</li>
    <li> They came packaged nicely all wrapped and sealed brand new, love the colors</li>
    <li> The comparisons to Too Faced Melted lip colors are spurious.  While they do have very similar colors available, The Melted colors actually stick to your face for several hours.  While these colors are really very pretty and many are well pigmented, they do not stick around for very long.  I will admit my lips get a fair amount of use throughout the day (we&#x27;re not even counting my night job here), so much so that OCC Lip Tar doesn&#x27;t stay on longer than 4-5 hours, so I&#x27;m not expecting 12 hour wear.  A couple hours would be nice though.  I like the texture, I like the shine, the tingly peppermint is nice, they&#x27;re so pretty!  I would just like to have a glass of water without leaving all my lipstick on the glass.  The applicator kinda sucks too, these are better applied with a brush.</li>
    <li> These are great and cheap!&lt;br /&gt;I love melted by too faced but these are just as great. They do give off a minty flavor but it isn&#x27;t horrible! They last a long time and the pigment is perfect!</li>
    <li> Very good products! Love them all!!!!</li>
    <li> ok you no how when you put on regular color lipgloss its faded out or you have to keep putting to much on to get the color you actually want !! Na this lipgloss is literally like paint on your lips ❤️ so in love with it .. Great price to in stores I think there like 6 or 5$ each but don&#x27;t hesitate buy 😊</li>
    <li> These LA Girl Glazed Lip Paints are on point this season~~the color saturation is Amazing and the stain lasts for hours! They have a great shine, but are also easy to dust with a finishing powder for a perfect matte without loosing the color pop!</li>
    <li> Lipglosses aren&#x27;t pigmented enough. I like bright bold colors. Waste of money. Not worth it. Liquidy sticky texture.  Smells funky.</li>
    <li> I will marry the maker is this product, that&#x27;s how good it is.</li>
    <li> I love the colors of this product and it goes on real smooth, but it doesn&#x27;t stay put. It gets all over your teeth and it bleeds. But it looks good when your first put it on! I didn&#x27;t use it with a liner, I may try next time to keep it from bleeding.</li>
    <li> I love them. Didn&#x27;t get the earrings as stated in the add you would get with purchase. But for $15 getting 6 lip stains of this quality is a great buy. Defiently comparable to the Two Faced Melteds. I would order again!</li>
    <li> OMG these are the best lip paints ever, and they&#x27;re reasonably priced.  Better than Two Faced Melted wow.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good these were.  The product arrived quickly, packaging was great and I would gladly reorder from this vendor.</li>
    <li> I love love love these! They last forever you only need a tiny bit and they are so pigmented you can even mix them to make your own custom colors they remind me of my occ lip tars</li>
    <li> OMG I love these. I am a woman of color and I greatly appreciate the pop of color it shows very well on my lips! I also love the minty feel it gives off. THIS PRO DUCT IS AMAZING!!!! P.s. I&#x27;m in love with the purple!</li>
    <li> Colors are very pigminted. They last a long time. They are definitely a dupe for morr expensive ones.</li>
    <li> I love it! Thanks for the gift!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! I absolutely love the colors, beautiful.</li>
    <li> Great product........ They do exactly what they are meant to do</li>
    <li> Absolety love! I placed my order around eleven at night on a weds and received my order on Friday. It was expected to arrive in a week and a half and I was so shocked. It was package so tight and secure I was so happy with the results. The pigmentation is phenomenal. To buy the set was a better deal than buying them on their site. Plus the earrings were an adorable surprise.</li>
    <li> I loved the colors they were amazing I aslo loved how quickly I receiced them</li>
    <li> Just ok to me. I hated the smell and the product didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Love the product...suuuuper fast shipping. Very pleased! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! Lots of variety.</li>
    <li> I love these glosses! They are highly pigmented &amp; the lipgloss is the exact shade as the tube so you know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. You can&#x27;t beat the price either. Finally an inexpensive lip product that is probably 10 times better than the high end products out there. They&#x27;re not sticky, they don&#x27;t bleed, &amp; you basically get the same color coverage as a lipstick. They also have a slight minty smell when first applied which I love. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. The beauty guru&#x27;s I watch on YouTube were right. 2 thumbs up.</li>
    <li> So pigmented and so affordable. A must!</li>
    <li> Great product! Absolute repurchase.</li>
    <li> It works well and color stays for a while, just wish it had a little more of a moisturizing effect</li>
    <li> Really pretty colors, and very pigmented. Doesn&#x27;t dry my lips, but the only thing I didn&#x27;t like very much was the application part of the gloss, it can be a bit difficult. But other than that, great product and it&#x27;s a bargain !</li>
    <li> pretty intense color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful and outstanding. just be sure not to over apply it. small amount on the lips will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt; I use these colors in top of dry lipstick (usually I use lipstick that its close to the color of the gloss) it does give the lips nice glossy and sheer look (it also give the feel of having full lips). definitely got compliment about my make up when I have them on it give the bright glowy face.</li>
    <li> Love the color varieties and will buy again</li>
    <li> These are amazing packaging is VERY Similar to the Too Faced melted lipstick (which I also love) only downfall is they are $21.00 each 😢 but the price of these were amazing!!!! They&#x27;re regularly $4.95 a pop but all 6 for only $16.93!?!? Very happy with my purchase will be getting another package soon to have for safe keepings....will be back!!!!</li>
    <li> I use these colors all the time on top of pencil liner. Pigmented, great, my favorite is coy. Only issue is, they are messy and bleed sometimes. But still worth it!</li>
    <li> highly pigmented long wearing</li>
    <li> I love these lip paint!!! It&#x27;s great and the colours stands out..</li>
    <li> They arrived super fast with free cute earings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a lip product junkie and I have literally tried almost every single brand and type of lip product out there. Believe me when I tell you these are AMAZING!!  They are so unbelievable..so pigmented and last forever. I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with these!  And a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> Great Deal! &amp; Loved The Colors. A little goes along way..more glossy then I thought but Im still in love!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors but very runny and messy.</li>
    <li> I am super impressed by these glazes, especially for the price. They are a great alternative to the Too Faced Melted glazes for a fraction of the price. They do get on your teeth pretty badly, so be sure to blot them with a tissue before walking out the door :) Great lasting power and high-quality pigmentation. I&#x27;m glad I bought these!</li>
    <li> Color payoff with this product is brilliant. The price point is right on base with this product as well. The colors are beautiful but I would say not for the faint of heart. If you are looking for playful colors you may have found just what you have been searching for. Mixing these colors is also amazing to create something very customizable. I have received so many compliments on them. Plus they have an amazing mint scent to them which is lovely. My 3 star rating comes from a few draw backs. First let me preface this by saying I&#x27;m the queen of matte. That being said extremely glossy lip products are not my go to. These are glossy and not always the good kind of glossy. They rub off easily and will get on literally everything. The formula is such that it makes the product sticky and quite oily feeling. They do not last through much of anything such as drinking and eating. I&#x27;m not typically hard on my lipsticks either. I think in many reviews as it mentions the applicator leaves something to be desired. If you are looking for a product to kiss a letter and make a perfect print of your lip this is indeed the product for that. As for pretty much anything else besides looking really amazing on and not moving your lips this is a winner.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy more</li>
