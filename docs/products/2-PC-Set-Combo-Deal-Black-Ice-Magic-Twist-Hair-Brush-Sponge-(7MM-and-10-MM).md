      <li>It works much better on shorter hair.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  </li>
      <li>Great product, works just fine on natural hair, very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Both of my sons have hair that will easily fro, wave or curl, depending on length and style.</li>
      <li>Really Amazing.. Really works..</li>
      <li>I LOVEEEE these products, they really transform my hair into a nice twist style (using the large hole brush) or cute curls/</li>
      <li>Using a regular bath sponge was more effective.</li>
      <li>Wow this sponge is like magic!</li>
      <li>Met all expectations for short hair, not so good on longer hair.</li>
      <li>If you just want some curls that aren&#x27;t full twists then use it for a shorter time.</li>
      <li>It takes probably 8 minutes to get a head full of twists.</li>
      <li>The circular motion used to creates the twists my even help stimulate my scalp since I use a good activator/moisturizer with it daily!!!  </li>
      <li>Super deal.</li>
      <li>My 7 year old uses this brush on his own hair and he looks like he&#x27;s fresh out of the barber shop every time.</li>
      <li>THANKS!!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
      <li>One&#x27;s hair is a little longer; his hair a bit denser/thicker so he uses the one with the larger holes and it works great, gives his hair nice curls/coils that he likes.</li>
      <li>Delivery was right on time too.</li>
      <li>Fast and exact!  </li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it says it do....</li>
      <li>Watch youtube videos before you buy it to really get a feel for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Everything I expected and more.  </li>
      <li>You should pick or comb your hair out before using this so that the hair can really get in the holes and twist.</li>
      <li>We really don&#x27;t use much product.</li>
      <li>We also appreciated the cost.  </li>
      <li>If you really want defined twists you need to use it for a longer time.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>I was able to creat curls on my short natural hair.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
      <li>For best results, use on full thick hair, if you have a thin patch it won&#x27;t work well.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and they cost a little more.</li>
      <li>My son is so into this new fad…he loves his sponges</li>
      <li>The other, uses the sponge with the smaller holes, because his hair is a little shorter and it works great on his hair as well.</li>
      <li>It even turns old hair cuts into something brand new.</li>
      <li>I got it for my 10year old son he like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this will work on straight Caucasian hair, or long curly hair.</li>
      <li>It really works, but depending on your hair texture you have to adjust the &amp;#34;dampness&amp;#34;, or even use it with your hair dry.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m loving them; I have been using sprays, powders and whatever to cover up my thinning spots on my head; using the sponges makes my hair look so much better and less conscious of my thin spots!!!</li>
      <li>I rubbed a little Shea Moisturizer Styling Smoothie in his hair and used this sponge and voila, mission accomplished - define curls that do not frizz all day.</li>

    <li> I bought the product for my 13 year old son who has very unruly thick coarse hair. We are very satisfied with the results after using it. My son now uses it every morning before school.</li>
    <li> My grandson are very pleased with the Magic Twist Hair Sponges.  We also appreciated the cost.  Other family members are expected to try them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work for my son. Wish we could return.</li>
    <li> I wish I had remembered this sponges some time ago!!!  I&#x27;m loving them; I have been using sprays, powders and whatever to cover up my thinning spots on my head; using the sponges makes my hair look so much better and less conscious of my thin spots!!! The circular motion used to creates the twists my even help stimulate my scalp since I use a good activator/moisturizer with it daily!!!  Quite pleased!!!</li>
    <li> My twin boys are 11 and they use them everyday with enthusiasm. One&#x27;s hair is a little longer; his hair a bit denser/thicker so he uses the one with the larger holes and it works great, gives his hair nice curls/coils that he likes. The other, uses the sponge with the smaller holes, because his hair is a little shorter and it works great on his hair as well. Both of my sons have hair that will easily fro, wave or curl, depending on length and style. We really don&#x27;t use much product. I have them spray a little of my  coconut oil on their hair and then they swirl the sponge or sometimes they just dampen their hair with water and then use the sponge. I highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does</li>
    <li> Wow this sponge is like magic! I was looking for a way to define the curl pattern in my son&#x27;s bushy frizzy hair and this gadget delivered. I rubbed a little Shea Moisturizer Styling Smoothie in his hair and used this sponge and voila, mission accomplished - define curls that do not frizz all day. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> great works very good !!!</li>
    <li> Met all expectations for short hair, not so good on longer hair.</li>
    <li> Product is awesome. I like it and would recommend it. I am satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> It was not as expected. Ok product!</li>
    <li> I thought it worked on all hair lengths only short hair</li>
    <li> Great product and ultra-fast delivery. It really works, but depending on your hair texture you have to adjust the &amp;#34;dampness&amp;#34;, or even use it with your hair dry. You also have the option of &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; twist with the 2 brushes!</li>
    <li> This product does not live up to the hype.</li>
    <li> Got my item on time. I haven not used the product yet, I&#x27;m growing out my hair. Heard great reviews about this product, I cant wait to use it! THANKS!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my grandson, and he loves them !!!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal on great brushes. For best results, use on full thick hair, if you have a thin patch it won&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> Love them!! Once I got the hang of it I can&#x27;t live without them!</li>
    <li> I got it for my 10year old son he like it. my now son do his own hair</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with african hair who been trying to get curls for years using curl kits with no success. I randomly used a dish sponge on my hair to get grease out and it curled my hair. I got on google and started googling this phenomenon which led me hair...lol. This is the only thing you need to curl yo hair. I promise</li>
    <li> It does exactly what it says it do....so there&#x27;s that.</li>
    <li> The product is exactly as described. The price could not be beat. It works much better on shorter hair. I was able to creat curls on my short natural hair. I just dampened it with plain water or some product, start rubbing I a circular motion and there you go!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.  I recently purchased the same product from another vendor.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the curl definition it gave.  Using a regular bath sponge was more effective.</li>
    <li> its great..lived up to the advertising...</li>
    <li> The product is great!! It&#x27;s durable, well made and I can see me ordering it again when the need arises.</li>
    <li> Great product, works just fine on natural hair, very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Before buying this product, I watched a lot of videos of how it works on youtube and how to use it. I don&#x27;t think this will work on straight Caucasian hair, or long curly hair. It seems it&#x27;s best suited for twa (teeny weeny afros). I was hesitant to buy the two pack but I wasn&#x27;t sure which size would work best so I saw this deal and bought the one that had both sizes. I LOVEEEE these products, they really transform my hair into a nice twist style (using the large hole brush) or cute curls/slight twists (with the small hole brush). I put product in my hair and then use the magic twist. You should pick or comb your hair out before using this so that the hair can really get in the holes and twist. It takes probably 8 minutes to get a head full of twists. If it&#x27;s not working try circling the brush in the other direction. If you really want defined twists you need to use it for a longer time. If you just want some curls that aren&#x27;t full twists then use it for a shorter time. Watch youtube videos before you buy it to really get a feel for what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Well satisfied with the product and customer service!</li>
    <li> I like the brush sponge, works effectively at creating hair twist.</li>
    <li> It met my expectation. Delivery was right on time too.👍</li>
    <li> These sponges are great!! I&#x27;ve used these before, I purchased them separately in the past.  Because I need two different sizes, I purchased 2 and they cost a little more. I&#x27;m happy to know I can purchase them as a combo from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Works great my son hair,  I very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son and he loves it!!!</li>
    <li> I like it ,and it works well.</li>
    <li> Great product! My 7 year old uses this brush on his own hair and he looks like he&#x27;s fresh out of the barber shop every time.</li>
    <li> Everything I expected and more.  First use showed great results.  Did not believe it would work until I received it.  My son loves it and so does my wife who uses for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Really Amazing.. Really works..</li>
    <li> Super deal. Great seller. Fast and exact!  Product worked well!</li>
    <li> I love it! It does the job! I get compliments everywhere I go. It even turns old hair cuts into something brand new. Must have! Very convenient.</li>
    <li> My son is so into this new fad…he loves his sponges</li>
    <li> Great product. Good price. My son likes it a lot. He can finally get the style that he&#x27;s been trying to get for months.</li>
