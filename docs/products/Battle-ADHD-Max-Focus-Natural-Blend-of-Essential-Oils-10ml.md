    <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it&#x27;s successful but does seem to help my grandson focus better in school.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Do not buy it is crap.</li>

    <li> I had high hopes for this oil due to the number of good reviews. Sadly these are poor quality and I suspect not pure essential oils, more like synthetic fragrance oils.</li>
    <li> I like this on my office desk while I&#x27;m working using a diffuser! Fabulous for long hours!</li>
    <li> Works great for aromatherapy!</li>
    <li> I give this to my son who has adhd and i believe it really has been helping him ive noticed that he has bewn concentrating better and listening more im glad ive tried this</li>
    <li> Multiple oils from this company have been tested and have proven to be adulterated and NOT pure essential oils. Regarding their &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Peppermint&amp;#34;:&lt;br /&gt;These two oils were both adulterated with synthetics. They are not pure oils.&lt;br /&gt;The Peppermint testing states: &amp;#34;The sample was cut with over 50% of synthetic benzyl benzoate.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Lavender testing states: &amp;#34;This sample of Lavender shows heavy adulteration with synthetic linalyl acetate. A dead giveaway is the presence of dihydro linalyl acetate which is an impurity that does not occur in nature but arises from the process of synthetic linalyl acetate production.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Most people purchasing essential oils are using them therapeutically and try to stay away from synthetic chemicals. These &amp;#34;oils&amp;#34; are FULL of synthetics. These are NOT pure essential oils!</li>
    <li> I am giving this to my friends, cousin!!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I tried applying topically diluted, then tried applying topically with no dilution, still no affect, tried to diffuse/inhale.... nothing. Can barely even smell anything, and obviously didn&#x27;t help with focus/control.</li>
    <li> I did not used this for myself. It came in a package that I won so it was free. I gave it to a friend, no complaints and she said it is helping her household!</li>
    <li> I have used this oil mainly at work. I have issues focusing sometimes and keeping my mind focused on my work where it should be. I have applied to my temples and back of neck. I am able to think more clearly and get my tasks done without losing train of though and focus. I have yet to try in my diffuser but will be this weekend. I also let me friend try it for her son who has ADHD and she said she noticed a difference when he was doing his homework. He wasn&#x27;t as fidgety as he normally is and seemed to be concentrating more than he normally does. I am very impressed with the results after trying this. I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own</li>
    <li> I feel it does help in a calming uplifting purifying way....clean energy....not coffee crazy jitters...using it at my study desk and it helps</li>
    <li> My nephew has adhd and I use this in his laundry. I put several drops in when it&#x27;s in the rinse cycle and it does seem to help. The aroma is nice too. I won this as a gift</li>
    <li> Way too weak. One can barely smell it even putting on a lot of it. Did not find it helpful.</li>
    <li> I can hardly smell it!</li>
    <li> I purchased Max Focus oil to see if it would help my son who has ADHD. It really seems to be helping. Able to pay attention. It has a pleasant smell. I just rub some on the back of his neck in the morning. I&#x27;ll rub more on later in the afternoon or put some on his wrists.</li>
    <li> I like this scent.  It really has helped me focus.  Add this scent to your wrists, back of your ear, even has a mist with water and about 10 drops of the oil depending how strong you want it. It&#x27;s perfect! One of my top oils!</li>
    <li> When you need to free yourself from distractions and focus on a project, this stuff is awesome. It smells good too!&lt;br /&gt;For maximum benefits, apply generously, rolling on in a circular motion, 5x each, to temples, side and back of neck. Inhale deeply after each application. Reapply frequently throughout the day to promote concentration. Also try in a diffuser! Best not to use within 2 hours of bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I have been using this on my daughter for a few weeks now and says it is helping her stay focused and works well. This is information from her since she is 12....her teachers say they notice a small difference but middle school teachers have so many students I am not sure how much they would notice unless it was a drastic change. It is definitely worth trying and since we have begun to use this instead of medicine, she has not had any nose bleeds or stomach pains which is a huge factor for me.</li>
    <li> Order arrived quickly. Bottle looks much bigger in the picture and I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see results, but others wise happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I suffer from adult onset ADHD and have tried all the drugs - which all have terrible side effects.  I was looking for a natural alternative and I found it!  I get the same ability to focus as taking strattera - without the cost ($275/month) and without any side effects.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my son he hasn&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
    <li> Honestly, I was too leery of this product to even try it. It was no real information on the label as to what&#x27;s in it and where the oil was harvested. And information on the company is also lacking. I like to verify that my oils are pure and safe and with this I couldn&#x27;t. If I had not had a code to receive the oil for free, I would have definitely returned it. I only want what&#x27;s best for my family and I didn&#x27;t feel this product fit the bill.</li>
    <li> Great smell!!!  I love Villager!!!</li>
    <li> I teach online classes very early in the morning and have been dragging around and unable to concentrate due to extreme tiredness. So I dabbed a drop on each temple and on the back of my neck, and I could tell that it was helping me focus on my work. This product is only mildly scented, so you can put it on and forget you are wearing it. I have this product next to my computer for a quick &amp;#34;brain fix&amp;#34; whenever I need it!  I received this product in return for an honest, unbiased review.</li>
    <li> received this free for a review. it has helped my son with adhd focus and i would purchase again and again</li>
    <li> I love this blend. When I have a lot of work to do on the computer but there seems to be a lot going on around me I will put a drop on the back of my neck and it seems to help me focus on what I need to get done. I have also put a few drops in my diffuser and sit it next to me and it seems to work well. I like the scent a lot. I am very happy with the results I have gotten.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This has helped with my husband&#x27;s ADD.  Smells great and really helps with focus.  Far beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> Kinda crappy dispensing system but as far as how well it works, sure has not helped my memory any in the couple days I have had it.</li>
    <li> Honestly I haven&#x27;t used this oil because there aren&#x27;t any ingredients or oils listed on the bottle. The oil itself has hardly no smell at all.</li>
