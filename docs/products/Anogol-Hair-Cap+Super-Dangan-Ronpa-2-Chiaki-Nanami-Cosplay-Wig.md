      <li>and now they fit my face perfectly.</li>
      <li>It is good quality</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but I had to cut a good 4-6 inches off the front just to get them to rest at my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>, I was very pleased.</li>
      <li>I recommend this for anyone cosplaying Chiaki Nanami-- though, if you want her EXACT color, your best bet is to buy-and-dye, or find another wig.</li>

      <li>I received this wig exactly two weeks after I ordered it, and it&#x27;s in great condition.</li>
      <li>The wig was fantastic!</li>
      <li>I was impressed with the end curls on the wig, but needed to cut them short and re-curl them to make her hair the correct length.</li>
      <li>I used some synthetic hair spray on the wig just to make sure the curls in the back don&#x27;t come out because they are perfect how they are now.</li>
      <li>I love this wig and would recommend it 100%.</li>
      <li>All in all, this wig HAS to be one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve purchased with a low price!</li>
      <li>and I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from the wig.)</li>
      <li>It looks adorable on her.  </li>
      <li>I love the flares at the ends.</li>
      <li>I love this wig</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my FAVORITE wig</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost whitish-purple in the light, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend taking pictures in direct indoor lighting-- sunshine is perfect, and dimmer lights indoors would be fine too.</li>
      <li>Super cute!</li>
      <li>My daughter was so excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
      <li>the wig was a cute style made of good quality it came in a reasonable time frame</li>
      <li>Perfect wig, arrived right on time and is so soft ^.^ doesn&#x27;t tangle easily either.</li>
      <li>in all this is one of my favorite wigs, and the material is fantastic and durable.</li>
      <li>Had to trim the bangs but that was easy peasy.</li>
      <li>Soft and nice!</li>
      <li>Pretty nice and comfortable.</li>
      <li>But it fits fine on my head.</li>
      <li>Slightly more beige depending on the light but had a roomy cap and came quickly.</li>
      <li>Cut and styled accurately, except for the bangs which you will have to cut yourself.</li>
      <li>like everyone has been saying, the bangs need a HUGE trim.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Though it is a bit lighter in the light than the picture, but it still resembles Chiaki&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>An overall great wig, it was styled well and the color matched.</li>
      <li>Anyway, with some consciousness about styling, this wig is really fantastic.</li>
      <li>so they fit against my face the way hers do.</li>
      <li>Not only was shipping fast, but the wig itself is actually really great quality!</li>
      <li>I love it so much!</li>
      <li>(This also helps the hair to look thicker and more natural since it covers the ears more.)</li>
      <li>Pretty soft too and the flips look nice!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s accurate and pretty!</li>
      <li>It also came super fast and is super easy to work with !</li>
      <li>but I love it soooooo much</li>
      <li>but overall I loved it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really pretty and shiny and the fibers untangled easily.</li>
      <li>Its very soft, the color is perfect, and there&#x27;s little to no styling involved to get it to look just right.</li>
      <li>wig was very silky and comfortable to wear, and it stayed in place well</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic wig, very silky, and well styled.</li>
      <li>The bangs are a bit long but that&#x27;s okay!</li>
      <li>The hair is a little long, but it&#x27;s otherwise perfect!</li>
      <li>I would give this five stars if the size for this wig was a bit more bigger..</li>
      <li>so styling the wig isn&#x27;t that much work!</li>
      <li>I love it and it has set the bar for future wig purchases.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this wig if you plan to cosplay as Chiaki, it is well worth the money.</li>
      <li>The picture is very true to the actual product, in terms of colour and thickness.</li>
      <li>This is my first cosplay, and I was a bit nervous about getting a wig, seeing how some aren&#x27;t as promising that they&#x27;re said to be, but the rating for this product is well-deserved.</li>
      <li>I had to trim the wig a bit because the bangs were too long for my face, however, everything else was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! :)</li>
      <li>Also, the pieces that curl in and rest on her cheeks weren&#x27;t really there at all - every bit of the wig curled out, away from the face.</li>
      <li>Looks like real hair.</li>
      <li>and I really recommend it.</li>
      <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the pictures posted, seeing as how it&#x27;s much lighter and a more natural pink champagne/beige.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no skin cap or hair part; all the fibers extend from a central point, which looks pretty cute in theory but does have the tendency to make the head look too big if the hair curls too closely against the neck.</li>
      <li>It was odd putting it on because this is the first wig I&#x27;ve actually gotten, but I love it!</li>
      <li>Soft, pretty accurate color of the picture shown, bangs are long had to cut</li>
      <li>I do wish it was slightly darker or more brown, but I&#x27;m nitpicky when it comes to my cosplays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to all Chiaki Nanami cosplayers.</li>
      <li>If you plan to cosplay Nanami i highly recommend this wig.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It only took two days to get here, it feels SUPER soft, and the bangs were already cut!</li>
      <li>It looks so good that I would even recommend wearing it in public, or with everyday clothes!~</li>
      <li>I have a relatively normal sized face and head, so keep that in mind when you buy</li>
      <li>like the picture i had to style it a bit and cut the bangs but other than that it was just fine.</li>

    <li> Soft, pretty accurate color of the picture shown, bangs are long had to cut but that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> Perfect wig, arrived right on time and is so soft ^.^ doesn&#x27;t tangle easily either. Very happy with this :)</li>
    <li> great quality! roomy wig cap so great for all head sizes</li>
    <li> I had to trim the wig a bit because the bangs were too long for my face, however, everything else was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! :)&lt;br /&gt;Your services are great, and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> The first wig I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I didn&#x27;t have too high of expectations, but they were definitely exceeded. An overall great wig, it was styled well and the color matched. It arrived way earlier than I thought it would, which was a plus since it came in time for Christmas. It came in a bag, but it didn&#x27;t ruin the quality of it one bit. For a bag, it was incredibly well protected. The bangs were a little long, but it covers my forehead nicely since it&#x27;s a bit on the larger side. I love it and it has set the bar for future wig purchases. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone cosplaying Nanami.</li>
    <li> Soft and nice! Feels very real, but the bang flare is too wide for a big face like mine.</li>
    <li> I got this wig just today and straight out of the package it was styled, a little messy but very soft and nice fiber. The bangs are long which I like, because I like cutting my own bangs, and after brushing through this wig it&#x27;s really pretty and shiny and the fibers untangled easily. Really great! Especially for this price!</li>
    <li> The hair is a little long, but it&#x27;s otherwise perfect! The color for Chiaki&#x27;s hair was giving me grief, so I finally broke down and bought a wig that was specifically made for her. When I opened it, I initially thought that it was too dark and had too much purple in it. (Chiaki&#x27;s hair is a strange purple-y blonde and I wasn&#x27;t really sure what to expect from the wig.) It&#x27;s also a little long for her, which is easily fixed. The bangs come long, so they&#x27;ll need to be cut, and her curls come at least to my shoulders before flicking up at the ends. I was impressed with the end curls on the wig, but needed to cut them short and re-curl them to make her hair the correct length. Also, the pieces that curl in and rest on her cheeks weren&#x27;t really there at all - every bit of the wig curled out, away from the face. I needed to cut a few inches off of the front pieces and re-curl those as well so they fit against my face the way hers do. (This also helps the hair to look thicker and more natural since it covers the ears more.) There&#x27;s no skin cap or hair part; all the fibers extend from a central point, which looks pretty cute in theory but does have the tendency to make the head look too big if the hair curls too closely against the neck. Leave the hair too long, your head looks big, but cut it too short and your neck looks really long. (Like Celia from Monsters Inc.) YOU JUST CAN&#x27;T WIN. Anyway, with some consciousness about styling, this wig is really fantastic. 10/10 color, softness, and thickness.</li>
    <li> Bought for an anime fan.  It looks adorable on her.  Nice wig.</li>
    <li> I love this wig it is the perfect shape and color! Despite what other people have said about the bangs, I only had to trim them slightly and now they fit my face perfectly. I used some synthetic hair spray on the wig just to make sure the curls in the back don&#x27;t come out because they are perfect how they are now. I highly recommend this wig if you plan to cosplay as Chiaki, it is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This wig is absolutely cute! Perfect color, and very soft too. I highly recommend it to all Chiaki Nanami cosplayers.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic wig, very silky, and well styled. It looks like the pictures, but the bangs were a bit longer and i had to trim them a bit... However this might just be the best one i own. If you plan to cosplay Nanami i highly recommend this wig.</li>
    <li> My daughter was so excited to receive this in the mail! It is perfect to go with her costume for the anime convention!</li>
    <li> It only took two days to get here, it feels SUPER soft, and the bangs were already cut! The picture is very true to the actual product, in terms of colour and thickness. It might be a little flat from being in a bag, but a little teasing is all you need to have it styled :) I love this wig and would recommend it 100%. It looks so good that I would even recommend wearing it in public, or with everyday clothes!~</li>
    <li> Awesome quality wig! It also came super fast and is super easy to work with !</li>
    <li> the wig was a cute style made of good quality it came in a reasonable time frame i was very happy with the product and i recommend it to everyone out there i rate angelhair with a 5 star rating thank you karen</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome. The bangs were really long and i had to do some cutting but other then that its great! It is good quality and I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this wig exactly two weeks after I ordered it, and it&#x27;s in great condition. However, it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the pictures posted, seeing as how it&#x27;s much lighter and a more natural pink champagne/beige. It&#x27;s almost whitish-purple in the light, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend taking pictures in direct indoor lighting-- sunshine is perfect, and dimmer lights indoors would be fine too. I do wish it was slightly darker or more brown, but I&#x27;m nitpicky when it comes to my cosplays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And like everyone has been saying, the bangs need a HUGE trim. I don&#x27;t know about everyone else, but I had to cut a good 4-6 inches off the front just to get them to rest at my eyebrows. I have a relatively normal sized face and head, so keep that in mind when you buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends to curl/flip up on their own, but it&#x27;s poorly styled. If you live in a sunny area, the heat may press your wig a little bit while it&#x27;s in the mail, causing it to loose its poof. In my case, the back was wavy and flat and looked awful, so I ended up blowdrying it straight on low heat and curling the ends up with gel and the hairdryer, and securing them with a light coat of hairspray. The front pieces do curl under your chin slightly too, but they&#x27;re a little short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other thing I have to say is that the wig fibers at the base of the cap are tangly and matted in some places, so make sure you gently comb your wig before styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is one of my favorite wigs, and the material is fantastic and durable. I recommend this for anyone cosplaying Chiaki Nanami-- though, if you want her EXACT color, your best bet is to buy-and-dye, or find another wig.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my FAVORITE wig and I adoooore wearing it when I can! The bangs were slightly long but I love it soooooo much</li>
    <li> I got my wig in a timely matter, and it was very nice quality! Be warned, the bangs will need a trim, but otherwise, even the ends flip up by themselves. I also likes the little note put in mine. I thought it gave it a sense of being not just mass produced. It was a nice choice to buy it, and it even came with a wig cap! Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! Spot on to nanami&#x27;a hair, shiny but not too shiny! Cut and styled accurately, except for the bangs which you will have to cut yourself. Awesome!!! Looks like real hair. Anangel never disappoints!</li>
    <li> The wig was fantastic! I love it so much! This is my first cosplay, and I was a bit nervous about getting a wig, seeing how some aren&#x27;t as promising that they&#x27;re said to be, but the rating for this product is well-deserved. The wig came out perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig was very silky and comfortable to wear, and it stayed in place well, I was very pleased. Also, it came 12 days earlier than expected! I was so happy. The wig fit perfectly on my head and it was easy to adjust and style, though it did take some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is a bit lighter in the light than the picture, but it still resembles Chiaki&#x27;s hair. Also, the bangs were so long! They reached down to my chin! But it took only a minute or so to cut them down to the appropriate length, so it wasn&#x27;t a major problem, and in the end it looked a lot like Chiaki&#x27;s hair. Also, the curls in the back and on the side of the wig didn&#x27;t stay in place very well, but I blame that on packaging, so it&#x27;s not really the seller&#x27;s fault, and it can easily be fixed and styled correctly with a bit of gel, so it&#x27;s not a very big issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this project was beautiful and I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to cosplay as Chiaki Nanami! I look forward to buying from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The bangs were too long and it took a while to get here</li>
    <li> Very cute! Worked well for Chiaki Nanami but needed some extra trimming around the face. Slightly more beige depending on the light but had a roomy cap and came quickly. Would recommend for cosplay or, depending on how much you would use it, daily wear.</li>
    <li> Super cute! I love the flares at the ends. Perfect shade for Nanami. It&#x27;s very soft and doesn&#x27;t tangle, the bangs are quite long but that&#x27;s expected because not everyone&#x27;s head is the same size. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> like the picture i had to style it a bit and cut the bangs but other than that it was just fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent-quality, especially if you&#x27;re going to be cosplaying Chiaki Nanami. The bangs are a tad bit long, and the hair often curls in the wrong direction, but that can easily be fixed. I received the wig precisely one week before the earlier expected arrival.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s accurate and pretty! I needed to cut the bangs a bit but overall I loved it.</li>
    <li> This wig is perfect! It&#x27;s thick and already curled as shown in my pictures I included. It&#x27;s the perfect colour. The bangs were long, but I already fixed that.</li>
    <li> Pretty nice and comfortable. I wish the last 2 I ordered from this company were the same color and design as the pic, but this wig is cool</li>
    <li> When this arrived I was so happy! It was odd putting it on because this is the first wig I&#x27;ve actually gotten, but I love it! It comes with a wig cap and a little hair band with a heart like in the picture. I love the quality! Recommended!</li>
    <li> Had to trim the bangs but that was easy peasy. It looks just like it does in the picture and hardly sheds at all. Pretty soft too and the flips look nice!</li>
    <li> Very good quality! Its very soft, the color is perfect, and there&#x27;s little to no styling involved to get it to look just right.</li>
    <li> This wig was everything that I expected! Not only was shipping fast, but the wig itself is actually really great quality! I would give this five stars if the size for this wig was a bit more bigger.. But it fits fine on my head. The bangs are a bit long but that&#x27;s okay! Also the tips flip up naturally so styling the wig isn&#x27;t that much work! But the downside about the wig in general, is that it sheds a bit.. All in all, this wig HAS to be one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve purchased with a low price! Would recommend this seller and I am definitely going to buy wigs from them again!</li>
