      <li>These are perfect and a must have for such tasks.</li>

      <li>Thanx again to Amazon and having this item available.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for &amp;#34;sterile&amp;#34; cotton tipped swabs to clean our home humidifier and these certainly fit our needs.  </li>
      <li>clean.....</li>
      <li>I used these to clean around my infant son&#x27;s feeding tube (mickey tube) site.  </li>
      <li>Bought these to use my clean</li>
      <li>These Q-Tip applicators are just perfect for cleaning circuit boards, getting into hard to reach places in devices, and applying everything from isopropanol to mineral oil to mineral spirits to axle grease.</li>
      <li>okay it absored water and blood readily.  </li>
      <li>One important one for me is being able to swab an inflamed sore throat directly with medication.</li>
      <li>Just exactly what you need and nothing else!</li>
      <li>fast delivery, product as promised, thank you !!</li>
      <li>These come in very handy on getting those circuit boards, tight corners, etc.</li>
      <li>I only use them every 6 months, so I appreciate the box size, which fits in a drawer nicely.</li>
      <li>i bought this just for extreme emergency uses when medical help may be delayed.&lt;br /&gt;can be used to clean out wounds, I&#x27;ve done it.&lt;br /&gt;a good item to apply to a wound without touching it, to apply ointment</li>
      <li>Very easy to open.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Very misleading!    </li>
      <li>They work very well, no complaints.</li>
      <li>They are as strong as they need to be to take care of a job such as what we intended them for, but also gentle enough to clean wounds and apply medication.</li>
      <li>Too much hassle to return</li>
      <li>Very misleading.</li>
      <li>bought this for an elderly person to use, it is very flimsy and breaks if any pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this item and the Seller!</li>
      <li>The product is very well made.</li>
      <li>Sturdy....when your done with them can use to stir your morning coffee, mix epoxy, stir little bottles of paint, or use use when you have to apply medication, clean wounds, and other normal uses...cost effective and worth the investment.....</li>
      <li>The cotton is wound pretty tight and does not fray easily.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>The sticks are a little flimsy but unless you need to do real pushing they work fine.</li>
      <li>Only wish the cotton tip be a little more thick thus could hold more liquid.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing Kendall sterile swabs for years, and these are not like my old ones.    </li>
      <li>If you are sensitive, these may not be for you.  </li>
      <li>Credit to Amazon, they fixed the photo.  </li>
      <li>I sent a report, and received an email that it would be fixed.      </li>
      <li>The q-tip itself was in general</li>
      <li>Had half a box left over after the treatments ended and used these in my gun cleaning kit to get into tight fitting areas.</li>
      <li>Beagles typically have ear issues and if I can clean them regularly, it will go a long way in alleviating ear problems in the future.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the only purpose for my purchasing this particular product because I don&#x27;t want to open one box, use one tip and let the rest exposed to air for a long time.</li>
      <li>It broke when a little too much pressure was put on it.  </li>

<li> It broke when a little too much pressure was put on it.  </li>
<li> The Qtips are OK, but are not soft or &#x27;puffy&#x27;...these are harder than usual, with a small amount of cotton making the tip.  </li>
<li> I did try to switch to regular Q-tip type swabs that are not wooden when it was no longer deep, but they were not strong enough to push the packing in.  </li>
<li> Needed a Q-Tip with a long stem for cleaning the ears of cats and dogs.  </li>

<li> Instead, I received 100 loose applicators in a paper bag.</li>
<li> Arrived at my home before I expected.</li>
<li> I ordered the dual-sided Q-Tips and received a box with single-sided Q-Tips, but other than that they do the job.</li>
<li> There may be other biodegradable material that can be used other than wood.  </li>
<li> I was looking for a larger cotton tip and these are quite small.</li>
<li> On occasion the stick part may break but that has happened with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> The only negative is the wooden stick, a slight pressure applied to it and it breaks in half...</li>
<li> For some reason these are really hard to find around town unless you go to a medical supply store I suppose.</li>
<li> Yet another item Amazon has but hard to find in local drug stores (Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS)!</li>
<li> I should have returned them but it would have been too much trouble for such a small item.</li>
<li> very little tip hard non absorbent and sticks are fragile would not reccomend this product</li>
<li> The wood handle seems a little brittle...</li>
<li> Only negative is that there were a few broken applicators in the box.</li>
<li> for hard to reach area&#x27;s.</li>
<li> otherwise, I can&#x27;t complained.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t rate these because I was sent the wrong brand.</li>
<li> I am very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> thank you just what we needed worked well</li>
    <li> they work, break easily though</li>
    <li> The q-tip itself was in general okay it absored water and blood readily.  But the only thing that bothered me was the weakness of the wooden shaft that held the cotton swab.  It broke when a little too much pressure was put on it.  But in a way this may be a good thing, preventing too much pressure on the wound cleaning it.</li>
    <li> Kendall makes some of the sturdiest shafts of all cotton tipped applicator manufacturers. I was looking forward to receiving them. However, these were not the sterile, individually wrapped applicators in the box as pictured! Instead, I received 100 loose applicators in a paper bag. This is not sterile at all, once the bag was opened. I am very disappointed. I could not use them for wound care. I should have returned them but it would have been too much trouble for such a small item. I won&#x27;t be ordering these again. Amazon should correct the picture to accurately reflect what customers will receive for this quantity/price.</li>
    <li> Would like a sturdier handle. There may be other biodegradable material that can be used other than wood.  Individual packing is preferred on some applications.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these applicators to anyone who uses Q-tips for anything.  They reach longer and are sturdier than the others.</li>
    <li> very little tip hard non absorbent and sticks are fragile would not reccomend this product how ever I did not get the Kendall brand receive a substitute product so</li>
    <li> great product...Restore vintage electronics...These come in very handy on getting those circuit boards, tight corners, etc. clean.....Sturdy....when your done with them can use to stir your morning coffee, mix epoxy, stir little bottles of paint, or use use when you have to apply medication, clean wounds, and other normal uses...cost effective and worth the investment.....Would recommend for any do it your self restoration project......</li>
    <li> i bought this just for extreme emergency uses when medical help may be delayed.&lt;br /&gt;can be used to clean out wounds, I&#x27;ve done it.&lt;br /&gt;a good item to apply to a wound without touching it, to apply ointment</li>
    <li> I love to take out one cleaner at a time knowing it is sterile. We use these to swab our Beagles ears with solution. Beagles typically have ear issues and if I can clean them regularly, it will go a long way in alleviating ear problems in the future.</li>
    <li> Bought these to use my clean my Rottweilers ears  and they work great. The only thing I would caution is in the end of the stick that I hold some of the packs have had splinters.</li>
    <li> It is what the Dr. ordered for cleaning out my dog&#x27;s ears, &amp; keeping them healthy.  I will order them again.  Jim</li>
    <li> These did not come as sterile but as 50 each in a pack. Once one pack is open the rest are no longer sterile. The picture is deceiving. Tried to send back even printed out the return slip and UPS/FED EX never came.</li>
    <li> These are great for my purpose. I use them to apply medicine to my foster kittens. It allows me to use the medicine with multiple animals without fear of contaminating the medicine tube. Only negative is that there were a few broken applicators in the box.</li>
    <li> I use these for slide smears, and they are great.  I only use them every 6 months, so I appreciate the box size, which fits in a drawer nicely.</li>
    <li> For some reason these are really hard to find around town unless you go to a medical supply store I suppose. I cannot comment on how well they work in that field but for my uses (detail cleaning cars, engines, helicopters etc) they work great. The only downside for me is something you would want in a medical environment - the individually wrappings can be a hassle, but I guess it keeps the others cleaner for me as well between uses.</li>
    <li> I used these to clean around my infant son&#x27;s feeding tube (mickey tube) site.  They work well.  The stick is fairly rigid, doesn&#x27;t bend or break easily.</li>
    <li> These are just what I wanted!  On occasion the stick part may break but that has happened with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Would definitely order this product.</li>
    <li> Yet another item Amazon has but hard to find in local drug stores (Walgreen&#x27;s or CVS)! Only wish the cotton tip be a little more thick thus could hold more liquid.</li>
    <li> These Q-Tip applicators are just perfect for cleaning circuit boards, getting into hard to reach places in devices, and applying everything from isopropanol to mineral oil to mineral spirits to axle grease. If I ever get around to swabbing my mouth for a DNA sample in the event I need to clone myself I&#x27;m sure they would work for that also.</li>
    <li> This item met all my expectations ! Just like if I went to a local drugstore to buy it !</li>
    <li> Very easy to open. Arrived at my home before I expected. The product is very well made. Q- tip head never shed cotton.</li>
    <li> all intact and in sterile condition.</li>
    <li> I found the product was adequate to my needs and at a good price.  The sticks are a little flimsy but unless you need to do real pushing they work fine.</li>
    <li> They work very well, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This product is very good because I needed something sterile..when I need to apply some betadine or any antibiotic ointment without using my fingers, this thing comes very handy and sterile. The only negative is the wooden stick, a slight pressure applied to it and it breaks in half...otherwise, I can&#x27;t complained.</li>
    <li> Great product! Mostly used for wound care. I feel safer using sterile Q-tips when applying sauves, etc.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Just what I was looking for</li>
    <li> It said 2 per pack, 100/bx under the description of the product.The Q-tips are supposed to be in individual packing with 2 in each. That&#x27;s the only purpose for my purchasing this particular product because I don&#x27;t want to open one box, use one tip and let the rest exposed to air for a long time. However, instead of 2 per pack, I got two boxes with 100 each in one bag! Then there is no point to buy this product since there is no individual packing at all!</li>
    <li> I was running out of the swabs I had and I needed them for wound care.  My daughter went to the drug store to purchase more.  She was told they were a medical supply and they didn&#x27;t sell them.  Where would you go to get medical supplies except the drug store?  I went to the place that sells EVERYTHING - Amazon.  I&#x27;m glad we have Amazon.  The swabs are great and with 100 packages with 2 swabs each, my wound better be healed before I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA (February 13, 2013):  The box did last until my wound was healed.  I did try to switch to regular Q-tip type swabs that are not wooden when it was no longer deep, but they were not strong enough to push the packing in.  I did have the wood on one or two of the swabs break, but most were fine and did the job needed.  With the original batch of swabs, there was a ruler on the packaging to make measuring the wound easy, but these didn&#x27;t have that feature.  It would be a nice addition, but doesn&#x27;t take away from the fact that these did do what I needed for them to do.</li>
    <li> No issues whatsoever.  Thx!</li>
    <li> they are really good and excellent</li>
    <li> I was looking for a larger cotton tip and these are quite small.</li>
    <li> Everything was as advertise. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I ordered the dual-sided Q-Tips and received a box with single-sided Q-Tips, but other than that they do the job.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t rate these because I was sent the wrong brand. I specifically asked for Kendall because they have a measuring gauge for wound depth. The ones I received didn&#x27;t. Too much hassle to return so I kept the Curity but would hesitate to order again.</li>
    <li> I used these to apply a gel like pain killer to the rear of my mouth while undergoing medical treatment.  Had half a box left over after the treatments ended and used these in my gun cleaning kit to get into tight fitting areas. The cotton is wound pretty tight and does not fray easily.</li>
    <li> This says it has 2 packs of 100 per box. The picture shows 2 boxes. Only one box came. Very misleading. The Q-Tips are 2 to an envelope and I&#x27;m guessing there are 50 envelopes. If you&#x27;re doing the math to determine which product gives you more for your money, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
    <li> Thanx again to Amazon and having this item available.  There are so many great uses for the longer &amp;#34;handle.&amp;#34;  One important one for me is being able to swab an inflamed sore throat directly with medication.</li>
    <li> I was looking for &amp;#34;sterile&amp;#34; cotton tipped swabs to clean our home humidifier and these certainly fit our needs.  They are as strong as they need to be to take care of a job such as what we intended them for, but also gentle enough to clean wounds and apply medication. The product arrived in excellent condition and sooner than anticipated.  I would highly recommend this item and the Seller!</li>
    <li> Good for what I ordered them for , I really have no review on this , it&#x27;e purpose is usefull</li>
    <li> Q-tips were packaged in paper bags of about 20-30, not as the 2/pk described.</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this transaction at all... The wood handle seems a little brittle... I would recommend this product...</li>
    <li> bought this for an elderly person to use, it is very flimsy and breaks if any pressure is applied.&lt;br /&gt;Good for just dapping no applying.</li>
    <li> It works as described.</li>
    <li> There are 2 boxes in the picture, but this is only one box of Qtips.  I would not have paid $10 per box.  Very misleading!    The Qtips are OK, but are not soft or &#x27;puffy&#x27;...these are harder than usual, with a small amount of cotton making the tip.  If you are sensitive, these may not be for you.  I&#x27;ve been purchasing Kendall sterile swabs for years, and these are not like my old ones.    I hope this helps.  Questions?  Post, and I&#x27;ll reply.    *****************  Update:  Credit to Amazon, they fixed the photo.  I sent a report, and received an email that it would be fixed.      It is one box.  Other comments in my review remain the same.</li>
    <li> Needed a Q-Tip with a long stem for cleaning the ears of cats and dogs.  These are perfect and a must have for such tasks.</li>
    <li> I had surgery on my back and could not reach the scar to put vaseline on it.  These were perfect! for hard to reach area&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Just exactly what you need and nothing else! Great flexibility and generous tip!</li>
    <li> I pick out my tonsil stones with these. Works great.</li>
    <li> fast delivery, product as promised, thank you !!</li>
