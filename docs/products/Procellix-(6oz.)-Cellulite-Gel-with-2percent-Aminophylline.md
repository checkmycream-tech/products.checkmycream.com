### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>genetics are awesome.  </li>
      <li>This works great</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why these people are saying its good.</li>
      <li>Now that summers coming up, I need to get more!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll let you know if it works better with more muscle on my thighs!</li>
      <li>nice seller:)</li>
      <li>Exercise helps a bit - that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
      <li>I love the product.</li>
      <li>So, I might give it another try with my more toned thighs.</li>
      <li>And I eat healthy and work out a lot.  </li>
      <li>however, what i have noticed is that those unsightly dimples on my butt and thighs are not so prominent.  </li>
      <li>Do I need to elaborate on that title?  </li>
      <li>i started running 5-6 times a week and eating more veggies, so i have a feeling running and diet helped out the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it is nice in that it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>While the cellulite didn&#x27;t go away completely, it&#x27;s appearance was greatly reduced after a month of using this product faithfully.</li>
      <li>It goes on easy with no greesy feelings.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Procellix is the only product that has helped me feel beautiful again.</li>
      <li>Using anti-cellulite lotion to target those jiggly spots beneath your bum might sound like an easy.</li>
      <li>After using this product for 2 months I see a huge decrease in the size of the cellulite bumps.  </li>
      <li>smooth, toned-looking legs bugs me</li>
      <li>with free shipping service it comes in about a week.</li>
      <li>and it really helped get rid of the cellulite on my legs!!!</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m in pretty good shape and run several times a week, but now that i&#x27;m in my 30s</li>
      <li>When i received it it came with a VERY cheap before and after pictures that you can clearly tell was photoshopped.</li>
      <li>So dont waste your money lets just except our celulite, and be happy.</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look right at all.  </li>
      <li>but, if you are proactive and workout and eat right i think you might see some positive changes.</li>
      <li>My sknin felt both smoothier and firmer after the first use.</li>
      <li>First saw this product on a Dr. Oz show that said it reduced the look of cellulite.  </li>
      <li>Upon more research, I have now learned that cellulite is not actually a reflection of fat cells, but the way in which your connective tissue attaches.</li>
      <li>also, when i first started using this product...</li>
      <li>This is my first review on amazon</li>
      <li>But more like iit&#x27;s been on  the shelf too long.  </li>
      <li>The back of my thighs looked smooth for the first time in my life.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this product several times before and it was fine.  </li>
      <li>i thought i&#x27;d give this product a chance, so i bought the \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; from the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, did my cellulite totally disappear?  </li>
      <li>I used the whole tube.  </li>
      <li>I used this product expecting to see a real difference in the cellulite in my thighs.</li>
      <li>Well, that&#x27;s a shocker to me, but it also does explain why there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything that gets rid of cellulite as well as why people who are really skinny also have cellulite.</li>
      <li>Believe me, you can find a product comparable to Procellix, and it won&#x27;t cost you as much.</li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>but if you use it with in two weeks will be much improvement.</li>
      <li>it really did work.  </li>
      <li>it did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
      <li>it is very pricy</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t notice much difference</li>
      <li>I was inspired to buy this because it mentioned (somewhere on some site) that it was a different kind of cellulite cream that actually penetrated the fat cells to do its work.</li>
      <li>But these creams are mainly gimmicks - I don&#x27;t think there is much you do to eliminate cellulite.  </li>
      <li>but so far, it looks promising.....</li>
      <li>This time the product isn&#x27;t what it normally looks like.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no way these lotions it can perform magical liposuction on our legs when it cannot penetrate past our skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all, and I have been using it but no effects whatsoever so far!</li>
      <li>This time same exact product purchased BUT, it&#x27;s a YELLOWISH in color.</li>
      <li>It should be a clear gel.  </li>
      <li>Theyre probably getting payed to write good reviews or its a fake account.</li>
      <li>So, as much as the idea that there is absolutely NO HOPE to get</li>
      <li>This product is not much better than any other that I have used to try to diminish the appearance of cellulite, but it is more costly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not perfect (thanks to gravity) by no means, but I can look in a full length mirror again.</li>

<li> Now I only use it a once a day to maintain my results and my bottle can last as long as two months!</li>
<li> May be a little too early to tell</li>
<li> but, so far, I think I do see a little improvement.  </li>
<li> So far, the front of my thighs seem a little bit smoother from the front view.  </li>
<li> So save your money for a massage, a facial or instead a membership at a Fitness Center!</li>
<li> I have used this product for the past year and it has gotten rid of my cellulite completely.</li>
<li> The change was noticable, but not worth the extra cost.</li>
<li> I paid $20 less for this product last year.</li>
<li> I used to have cellulite on the tops of the back of my thighs and a little on the front.</li>
<li> TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</li>
<li> I have only had the gel for a few weeks</li>
<li> Maybe some special cutting edge surgery -</li>
<li> obviously there is not magical cure to getting rid of cellulite.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, the manufacturers of these lotions make claims far bigger than their britches, leaving us...</li>
<li> Doctor oz recommeded the active ingredient in this gel for cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> However, I have a lot of cellulite - from my stomach all the way down to my knees.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m lifting weights and as my legs slim down the cellulite is diminishing as a result.</li>
<li> Getting older is hard, but having cellulite is worse.</li>
<li> Exercise to lose a little weight - that improves the look of it.</li>
<li> it was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> I saw no results at all, it was a waste of my money.</li>
<li> I believe that this product works, just give it a few months.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these creams.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure there is what they say in there.</li>
<li> I am not sure if this worked.  </li>
<li> I stopped wearing shorts, short dresses and especially swimsuits because I hated to look at my thighs.</li>
<li> unfortunantly product did not work sucks was so expencieve</li>
<li> I used the whole bottle and got no results, very disappointed in this purchase</li>
<li> Afraid to put it on my skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just shocked about the price increase.</li>
<li> I wanted it to work, but was disappointed.</li>
<li> and pm I end up extremely disappointed with the lack of results.</li>
<li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an expensive product!!!!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is what they say in there. It doesn&#x27;t smell like anything at all, and I have been using it but no effects whatsoever so far!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product several times before and it was fine.  This time the product isn&#x27;t what it normally looks like. It should be a clear gel.  This time same exact product purchased BUT, it&#x27;s a YELLOWISH in color. But more like iit&#x27;s been on  the shelf too long.  I dont know but it doesn&#x27;t look right at all.  Afraid to put it on my skin. Who knows might get a rash or something from it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED. It&#x27;s an expensive product!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> obviously there is not magical cure to getting rid of cellulite.  i&#x27;m in pretty good shape and run several times a week, but now that i&#x27;m in my 30s the cellulite has appeared.  genetics are awesome.  i thought i&#x27;d give this product a chance, so i bought the \\&quot;free sample\\&quot; from the product page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, did my cellulite totally disappear?  of course not.  it&#x27;s a $50 bottle of gel, not a $5,000 procedure.  however, what i have noticed is that those unsightly dimples on my butt and thighs are not so prominent.  also, when i first started using this product... i started running 5-6 times a week and eating more veggies, so i have a feeling running and diet helped out the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you buy this product it won&#x27;t solve all your cellulite problems.  but, if you are proactive and workout and eat right i think you might see some positive changes.</li>
    <li> I have cellulite on my thighs.  I go to the gym 5 times a week and watch what I eat, but the cellulite is substantial.  After using this product for 2 months I see a huge decrease in the size of the cellulite bumps.  I think if I keep using Procellix it will eventually disappear.  I used Nivea Bye Bye Cellulite for almost a year and saw no reduction in my cellulite.  I believe that this product works, just give it a few months.</li>
    <li> this gel felt like KY jelly when applied. I used the whole bottle and got no results, very disappointed in this purchase</li>
    <li> Do I need to elaborate on that title?  My cellulite is still the same.  I had hoped for a different result, but that was just wishful thinking.</li>
    <li> This product is not much better than any other that I have used to try to diminish the appearance of cellulite, but it is more costly. I used this product expecting to see a real difference in the cellulite in my thighs. I put it on before going to bed. When the alarm awakened me I jumped up and looked in the mirror. The change was noticable, but not worth the extra cost. Believe me, you can find a product comparable to Procellix, and it won&#x27;t cost you as much. I&#x27;m lifting weights and as my legs slim down the cellulite is diminishing as a result. So, I might give it another try with my more toned thighs. I&#x27;ll let you know if it works better with more muscle on my thighs!</li>
    <li> I bought two bottles of these.  I saw no difference in tightening of skin whatsoever.  And I eat healthy and work out a lot.  Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have to say that this product was a \\&quot;dud\\&quot; for me. I wanted it to work, but was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on a recommendation to use one containing aminophylline.  I used it for 2 months before rendering an assessment. I don&#x27;t know about other reviewers, but in my case I was surprised at how well it worked.  The back of my thighs looked smooth for the first time in my life.  I am definitely going to continue using a product like this.</li>
    <li> I tried this product for almost 2 months.  So far, the front of my thighs seem a little bit smoother from the front view.  However, I have a lot of cellulite - from my stomach all the way down to my knees. Procellix has done NOTHING to decrease the cellulite - I really don&#x27;t notice much difference and I don&#x27;t think it will change.  Exercise helps a bit - that&#x27;s for sure.  But these creams are mainly gimmicks - I don&#x27;t think there is much you do to eliminate cellulite.  Maybe some special cutting edge surgery - but it&#x27;s costly.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on these creams.  Exercise to lose a little weight - that improves the look of it.</li>
    <li> I applied as directed on the label. NOTHING HAPPENED! TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. SAVE YOUR MONEY. TOTAL GIMMICK!</li>
    <li> First saw this product on a Dr. Oz show that said it reduced the look of cellulite.  Since it was recommended on the show, I decided to give it a try.  it really did work.  And it&#x27;s easy to use.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> I think it would take some time to show the benefits of this product but it is nice in that it is non-greasy and absorbs quickly.  We shall see!</li>
    <li> This is my first review on amazon and I just had to review this. I bought it off the actual website.   This has to be one of the worst, scam products ever. When i received it it came with a VERY cheap before and after pictures that you can clearly tell was photoshopped. I used it as directed. I have no idea why these people are saying its good. Theyre probably getting payed to write good reviews or its a fake account. either way. STAY AWAY!!!!!!   DOESN&#x27;T WORK..   dont say i didnt warn u!!!  STAY AWAY!!!!!</li>
    <li> Once again another product that doesnt do what its suppose to do. I have used it for 2 weeks twice a day but have seen no change. So dont waste your money lets just except our celulite, and be happy.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if this worked.  I used the whole tube.  Doctor oz recommeded the active ingredient in this gel for cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;I would try it again... it is very pricy</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the past year and it has gotten rid of my cellulite completely. I used to have cellulite on the tops of the back of my thighs and a little on the front. By using Procellix in the morning and at night for three months it went away. Now I only use it a once a day to maintain my results and my bottle can last as long as two months! If you have cellulite, this is your solution!</li>
    <li> it was a waste of my money. it did absolutely nothing for me. i was extremely disappointed in this product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product for my legs and it really helped get rid of the cellulite on my legs!!!</li>
    <li> Procellix works for my wife, so I order it before she runs out.&lt;br /&gt;She actually gets nervous when she gets low.&lt;br /&gt;Even with free shipping service it comes in about a week.</li>
    <li> I was inspired to buy this because it mentioned (somewhere on some site) that it was a different kind of cellulite cream that actually penetrated the fat cells to do its work. So, I bought it. Upon more research, I have now learned that cellulite is not actually a reflection of fat cells, but the way in which your connective tissue attaches. Well, that&#x27;s a shocker to me, but it also does explain why there doesn&#x27;t seem to be anything that gets rid of cellulite as well as why people who are really skinny also have cellulite. So, as much as the idea that there is absolutely NO HOPE to get smooth, toned-looking legs bugs me, I also think that the truth of the matter should be revealed to all--it&#x27;s like whether you have blue eyes or brown eyes--it&#x27;s in your structure.</li>
    <li> I have only had the gel for a few weeks but, so far, I think I do see a little improvement.  May be a little too early to tell but so far, it looks promising.....</li>
    <li> Using anti-cellulite lotion to target those jiggly spots beneath your bum might sound like an easy. Unfortunately, the manufacturers of these lotions make claims far bigger than their britches, leaving us...women feeling shortchanged after six weeks of use with no results. There&#x27;s no way these lotions it can perform magical liposuction on our legs when it cannot penetrate past our skin. I have purchased Procellix (6oz.) Cellulite Gel with 2% Aminophylline; I eat healthy and work out daily, but unfortunately after using Procellix daily am and pm I end up extremely disappointed with the lack of results. So save your money for a massage, a facial or instead a membership at a Fitness Center!</li>
    <li> Im not overweight but have a lot of cellulite. All over my stomach and thighs and butt. This works great you have to use it daily and when u stop the cellulite comes back but if you use it with in two weeks will be much improvement.</li>
    <li> Getting older is hard, but having cellulite is worse. Cellulite made me feel self conscience about myself. I stopped wearing shorts, short dresses and especially swimsuits because I hated to look at my thighs. I definitely couldn&#x27;t let anyone else see it. I bought and tried every product on the market to get rid of it. Including, rubbing coffee grind on my thighs and I don&#x27;t even drink coffee. Procellix is the only product that has helped me feel beautiful again. I&#x27;m not perfect (thanks to gravity) by no means, but I can look in a full length mirror again. I even bought a bikini from H &amp; M the Beyonce collection. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it... 😄</li>
    <li> This product really works.My sknin felt both smoothier and firmer after the first use.It goes on easy with no greesy feelings.</li>
    <li> I paid $20 less for this product last year. I love the product. I&#x27;m just shocked about the price increase.</li>
    <li> Great product. Takes time to notice the reduction. Be patient with it and use it two times a day. I&#x27;m on my third bottle and will continue to use this product .</li>
    <li> nice seller:) unfortunantly product did not work sucks was so expencieve</li>
    <li> I saw no results at all, it was a waste of my money. Would not recommend or try it again.</li>
    <li> Heather T.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work out and try to watch what I eat but I couldn&#x27;t help notice that I was starting to get cellulite on my thighs. I heard about this product and figured I&#x27;d try it. While the cellulite didn&#x27;t go away completely, it&#x27;s appearance was greatly reduced after a month of using this product faithfully. Now that summers coming up, I need to get more!</li>
