      <li>Love this hand cream!</li>
      <li>I just love this scent, and thankfully my boyfriend does too!</li>
      <li>The scent is amazing too.</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and isn&#x27;t greasy on your hands.</li>
      <li>This is an exact scent match of the Tainted Love perfume and it&#x27;s also a great lotion.</li>
      <li>I wear a lot of their scents and have many handcreams.</li>
      <li>I received this lotion as a sample from sephora and wasn&#x27;t able to forget about it since.</li>
      <li>I love this hand lotion.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly, does a decent job moisturizing lightly dry hands, and has a wonderful warm scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and smells amazing!!</li>
      <li>I have used this hand cream at night, and my hands are still lightly scented by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and my hands feel so smooth when I use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I enjoy this hand cream a lot.</li>
      <li>smell SO good and makes hands really soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of scented lotions, but this one seems to leave just the perfect, subtle scent on your skin.  </li>
      <li>And, it is super moisturizing.</li>
      <li>The scent itself is pretty strong at first,</li>
      <li>The Tainted Love scent has light overtones of vanilla that give way to the warmth of sandalwood tempered by the orchid and white tea.</li>
      <li>Such a sweet and yet sexy scent.</li>
      <li>I would caution people with sensitive noses that the scent is somewhat strong at first, but lessens after absorption.</li>
      <li>A friend of mine plays violin and was worried that using this hand creme would make it difficult to play, but on the contrary, she was so impressed, she placed an order for it too.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this from several stores and it has always been one of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>I just love this handcream and especially the way it smells!  </li>
      <li>Love this cream and how long the fragrance lasts without being overbearing.</li>
      <li>I normally steer clear of perfume scented lotions because they aren&#x27;t nice to my skin - drying, greasy, smells different than the perfume, etc.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very hydrating and the scent sticks throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing and smells heavenly.</li>
      <li>I pretty much wear it to carry the scent, but it keeps my hands soft, too.</li>
      <li>The product does leave your hands feeling wonderfully soft when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>Around 30-40 minutes later with minimal activity, that feeling disappears, leaving your hands feeling better than before, but not as well moisturized as other, more long-lasting hand</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s this vanilla scent and when the vanilla fades you get all the heavy undertones that mix and just smells so much more lovely and complex than surgery or powdery vanilla scents.</li>
      <li>i bought this for my mom on mothersday, shipped fast and came in such a cute packaging, the product is closed so you need a sharp knife or a screw to pop it open because the cap doesn&#x27;t come with a punch, but it&#x27;s not a big deal because it doesn&#x27;t need much pressure.</li>
      <li>However, the moisturized feeling does not last long and the scent seems overpowering at first.</li>

<li> Often when a product uses sandalwood, it is done poorly and the sandalwood overpowers the other scents and the overall scent profile becomes too earthy with little warmth.</li>
<li> I tried the perfume, and surprisingly, I disliked it.  </li>
<li> I would use it everyday if it wasn&#x27;t for the price.</li>
<li> I bought some in a boutique 2 years ago and it is one of the few scents that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches!</li>
<li> Like it was mixed wrong.  </li>
<li> This one from this vendor smelled weird.  </li>

    <li> I normally steer clear of perfume scented lotions because they aren&#x27;t nice to my skin - drying, greasy, smells different than the perfume, etc. BUT! Not this one... This is an exact scent match of the Tainted Love perfume and it&#x27;s also a great lotion. I would use it everyday if it wasn&#x27;t for the price.</li>
    <li> Amazing smell and very lovely packaging .. definitely i will buy again</li>
    <li> I received this lotion as a sample from sephora and wasn&#x27;t able to forget about it since. When I found out that Amazon was selling it, I had to purchase it. It&#x27;s very hydrating and the scent sticks throughout the day. Definitely a steal.</li>

    <li> i bought this for my mom on mothersday, shipped fast and came in such a cute packaging, the product is closed so you need a sharp knife or a screw to pop it open because the cap doesn&#x27;t come with a punch, but it&#x27;s not a big deal because it doesn&#x27;t need much pressure. The scent itself is pretty strong at first, when she put it on i could smell it across the room, but it isn&#x27;t overpowering. It&#x27;s this vanilla scent and when the vanilla fades you get all the heavy undertones that mix and just smells so much more lovely and complex than surgery or powdery vanilla scents.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Smells great and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I just love this handcream and especially the way it smells!  I almost use it as perfume and I get stopped all the time and asked what am I wearing.</li>
    <li> This hand cream is one of the few scented products I use regularly.  Often when a product uses sandalwood, it is done poorly and the sandalwood overpowers the other scents and the overall scent profile becomes too earthy with little warmth. The Tainted Love scent has light overtones of vanilla that give way to the warmth of sandalwood tempered by the orchid and white tea. This is what properly done scents with sandalwood should smell like.  I would caution people with sensitive noses that the scent is somewhat strong at first, but lessens after absorption. In addition, the scent lasts on your hands a very long time. I have used this hand cream at night, and my hands are still lightly scented by morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, where I removed a star came from its use as a moisturizing hand cream. The product does leave your hands feeling wonderfully soft when you first put it on. Around 30-40 minutes later with minimal activity, that feeling disappears, leaving your hands feeling better than before, but not as well moisturized as other, more long-lasting hand creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I enjoy this hand cream a lot. It absorbs quickly, does a decent job moisturizing lightly dry hands, and has a wonderful warm scent. However, the moisturized feeling does not last long and the scent seems overpowering at first.</li>
    <li> Love this hand cream! It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I bought some in a boutique 2 years ago and it is one of the few scents that doesn&#x27;t give me headaches! The perfume is great as well!</li>
    <li> Love this cream and how long the fragrance lasts without being overbearing.</li>
    <li> A sample of this products was sent to me when I ordered some sunscreen lotion on Amazon. I love it! It smells so good and my hands feel so smooth when I use it. I don&#x27;t even have to wear perfume. Some ingredients in it are organic which I like a lot. This is going to be THE hand cream that I&#x27;ll use from now on. It makes for an amazing gift!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this from several stores and it has always been one of my favorite scents.  This one from this vendor smelled weird.  Like it was mixed wrong.  Kinda smelled like nail polish remover.</li>
    <li> I love this hand lotion. It smells amazing and isn&#x27;t greasy on your hands. My only wish is that I could buy it in a larger bottle because I am running through it crazy fast.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and smells heavenly. I am a big fan of Tokyo Milk products. I wear a lot of their scents and have many handcreams.</li>
    <li> Smells warm and delicious! And, it is super moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve ever used. It softens without being sticky. The scent is amazing too.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! Great for gifts, so many compliments!</li>
    <li> smell SO good and makes hands really soft.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect product. The scent is perfect and the item shipped on time. A friend of mine plays violin and was worried that using this hand creme would make it difficult to play, but on the contrary, she was so impressed, she placed an order for it too.</li>
