      <li>Was happy just feel like they sent too many of the same color, for the price was a good deal</li>
      <li>so I can use them on more then just gel nails.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got random colors however the foil is great I wish it was the colors I saw here but I can work with them. I contacted the seller because some looked like they had already been used. So they asked what they could do after that I was happy.</li>
    <li> The order came really fast, but I got three gold, four silver foils, and the rest where different colors.  You don&#x27;t get the colors in the picture. I guess you really get what you pay for ($5.80 worth of foils).</li>
    <li> I did not get all the colors that are posted on the picture but overall i&#x27;m happy with what I got. Beautiful colors and they are pretty easy to use. The only thing i&#x27;m having trouble using them on is gel polish. Other than that it&#x27;s worth getting.</li>
    <li> these had great color , lots of variety, glad i bought them. Got them to do nails with and i just love them.</li>
    <li> I love this method of glaming up nails. After you apply your second coat of your choice of color simply dab the dull side of the foil and it has a really cool effect. The options are endless with mixing and matching the colors in this package. The variety it comes with is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Love these foils.  So easy to use. A good price.&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if they had names and we were able to select the foils.&lt;br /&gt;I would order the ones I don&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> They are beautiful, haven&#x27;t used them on my nails yet</li>
    <li> This is not Transfer Nail Art Foil.  It is just plain nail foil.</li>
    <li> these are ok. They are difficult to use. You have to make sure your nail polish isnt too wet but not too dry to get these to work. I used them a few times and havent used them since.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is a great deal.  The foil comes rolled up in a plastic container, and has to be cut to use.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to do, but not so much that I would not recommend the stuff.  The added bonus of 12 plastic containers which I can reuse as storage for beads or glitter or whatever makes this a BUY item.</li>
    <li> Excellent！This product is full of high quality. It is a better choice to select the similar products from this seller.</li>
    <li> I tried using these with shellac and it peeled off the next day. Ive had much better foil than this.</li>
    <li> I love the product but I received 5 gold, 5 silver,  2 white. I expected 12 different foils. If it didn&#x27;t take so long to receive them I would&#x27;ve sent them back.</li>
    <li> The foils are great, but beware that you will not get the ones you see in this picture. You will get a random arrangement of different patterns.</li>
    <li> While these aren&#x27;t easy to use at first, it gets easier with practice.  You can create all kinds of looks with this foil, from subtle to flashy.  Would recommend to anyone that wants to get attention, as long as they have time to practice and get it right</li>
    <li> I was excited to get them, colors are decent. Rolls arent very big but overall happy. I wish the colors looked like the picture</li>
    <li> I thought this was a good buy considering. I am disaapointed that I got 3 duplicate bottles of foil...however, I liked the duplicates, so meh. Anyways, I thought the foil was long enough to do multiple sets of nails. Overall pleased.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty, I did receive a couple that were similar like silver but different patterns but I&#x27;m still happy with it. Keep in mind they don&#x27;t last very long but it&#x27;s well worth it and I&#x27;m happy with the amount for the cheap price!</li>
    <li> Possibly i&#x27;m not using the right foil glue - but the foil is not transferring over to my nail as expected.  Yes lots of color to choose from unfortunately - not for me.</li>
    <li> I got 3 gold ones, 2 hot pink ones and 7  more random colors. Did not get different ones! Small amount, not good quality. The title says 12 different styles, I only got 9 styles for $6. Will never order from them again!</li>
    <li> I looked up how to apply this on youtube and tried it, but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work. I wish this came with some instructions, or at least guided me to what type of glue to use. The foils came with nothing. Now I have pretty, metallic foils, but no directions on how to properly use it.</li>
    <li> This was a mistake.  I wish I didn&#x27;t purchase this. What was I thinking?  It is a waste.  I couldn&#x27;t even get a 12 year old to want to use it.</li>
    <li> Great colors and very easy to use. Instructions would be nice, but were also found on the internet. Does not wear long and can wear off with in the week.</li>
    <li> Price was good and shipping was fast, bbut I was very disappointed in my variety...or lack of. 5 of my 12 were silver, 2 each of 2 designs and 1 of a third. 4 of my 12 were fuscia,  all the same design. 2 of 12 were same design teal. I only recieved 5 colors out of 12 rolls. 8 were plain design and 4 were fancier.</li>
    <li> Good price &amp; good product</li>
    <li> These foils don&#x27;t come with the glue so you will have to purchase the glue on its own. However, the quality of these foils is fantastic and the colors are vibrant.</li>
    <li> This may be user error but I have not been able to get my nail covered with the foil. Specks of it are transferring but not all of it which gives the crackle effect. Not what I had in mind so I&#x27;m a bit disappointed but the price was cheap so I didn&#x27;t lose too much with the purchase.</li>
    <li> These foils are outstanding! Not only was shipping extremely fast, but they were all in perfect condition. I use them with my shellac/gel manicures/pedicures because the glue isn&#x27;t necessary and it works perfectly. I have done so many sets and they all look amazing! The color combinations are endless :)</li>
    <li> All the colors in this package are beautiful and none repetitive.,  I got a beautiful purple, gold, white, silver a beautiful multicolor, an Indigo, an electric blue, a glittery looking beautiful red, green, a holographic silver,and two more different multicolors. I&#x27;m very satisfy with this purchase and with the seller  since I asked her a question about this foil transfers few days after I ordered and she replied  promptly, very cordially a very helpful.</li>
    <li> I would recommend these colors to anyone who is into nails.  The case they are stored in keeps the product organized and free from any damage while working on nails.</li>
    <li> Foil is nice for the price.  Just take out the word adhesive because it does not come with any adhesive.</li>
    <li> Super sharp! Easy peasy and looks are infinite.  True, I got more silver than I would have liked but overall I am happy.  Want more colors/designs to play with!</li>
    <li> Love the colors but have a little trouble using them but would buy more</li>
    <li> easily peels and doesn&#x27;t last a day.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is you dont recieve all the colors you see in the pic... the foils are all beautiful but not as advertised.</li>
    <li> very nice set of foils they look really nice on and even better with a the tree different colors together</li>
    <li> Love this! Bought it originally because I saw a manicure on popsugar that used these. LOVE IT! So cute and perfect just pops of color. I used &amp;#34;Scraperfect Best Glue Ever, 2-Ounce&amp;#34; with this and it works great :)</li>
    <li> Good does not come alot but works great! Thanks</li>
    <li> Love the colors supplied</li>
    <li> What a huge let down.  I just received my order of these 12 nail foils. Unfortunately what got was not as advertised. The listing clearly states &amp;#34;12 Different Styles in the kit.&amp;#34; However what i got in my 12 piece kit was 3 of the exact same aqua blue, 3 of the exact same christmas green, 3 of the exact same dark blue shattered holo, 2 of the same white irridescent, and one clumpled up (damaged) gold.  Other than the white and gold, im not pleased with the colors or the fact that i didnt get 12 different styles.</li>
    <li> This is another product, that I didn&#x27;t understand.  It is rolled up foiled, pretty but you have to cut it yourself. If you don&#x27;t have something small and precise to cut it into fine pieces it is a waste of time.  Buy the foil already cut into small pieces.</li>
    <li> In the description of foils. It says 12 different foils. However, I did not receive 12 different foils. I received 9 different foils which means 3 are the same. I tried to leave 1 star but that was not acceptable so I&#x27;m trying 3 stars</li>
    <li> I am using this product for jewelry making.  The foil enhances my  designs.  It holds up well to glues and glazes which  really pleases me.</li>
    <li> Very cool product, lots of compliments on my nails, the color choices are awesome.  If you don&#x27;t have this product you should buy it soon!</li>
    <li> messy loose their luster after top coat is put on. Tried different tricks I found on line but still messy. Won&#x27;t use foils again.</li>
    <li> Thought they would be longer but it&#x27;s a good product</li>
    <li> I received 12 little containers, but only 3 colors. Gold, silver and a transparent color. They definitely don&#x27;t adhere by the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say I hate the product, it&#x27;s actually fun to use, just wish they would have sent more variety of colors as advertised on the picture.</li>
    <li> These were a waist of money. I could not make them stay in one place even with the bonder and they kept ripping.</li>
    <li> Yes..my granddaughter is very pleased. Terrific price and product....quick delivery considering the distance.</li>
    <li> Not all the colors like in the picture but it is still really good.</li>
    <li> These are too beautiful but be sure to buy the recommended adhesive which did not come with the product... However it arrived in a timely manner</li>
    <li> Well it isn&#x27;t exactly what I expected to get.  I didn&#x27;t get all of the colors pictured.  I got 4 different variations of gold but none of the red,white, or green designs that were shown. The little pots were also not full of the foil.  There is a very small amount of foil in each, leaving PLENTY of empty space inside. They are also a bit difficult to get on my nails but I&#x27;m sure that will get better with practice.  It&#x27;s not too bad for the price but they should have been up front about the fact that they are not sending full containers or the colors pictured.</li>
    <li> Have not used them yet ~ good variety of colors.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to everyone I know and anyone that asks. Nail foil is fun, easy, fast and best of all it looks so nice and you can do it yourself.</li>
    <li> i got the foils but there was no adhesive to use the product .. i am having a hard time ordering the adhesive by it&#x27;s self .. so i do not really know if this product works til i get some adhesive  .. when you read the description of the product  you would think the adhesive comes with it</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this product.Each foil came packed in a little jar.There was a lot of different colors to chose from.Unfortunately it does not come with nail glue.</li>
    <li> This should come with it&#x27;s own clear coat because it disintegrates the second you try to protect it.  However, it&#x27;s so shiny and glittery and amazing, you stare at your nails all day.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t colors on picture</li>
    <li> Great product - quick delivery!</li>
    <li> it is a random pick that I got in mine. and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great it didn&#x27;t take long to get here  only thing is it doesn&#x27;t come with glue and some are the same colors but other than that great</li>
    <li> love,love,love this  product it was easy to apply and the color ia great. i would recomend this to everyone .</li>
    <li> These are Fun, and look Great! Thee foil does fade fast, but it&#x27;s still fine...  Just don&#x27;t forget to order the foil adhesive!</li>
    <li> Was happy just feel like they sent too many of the same color, for the price was a good deal</li>
    <li> These transfers are really cool.  I&#x27;m not into some of the colors (green/electric blue).  I have got a lot of compliments on my nails when I&#x27;ve used them.  They are easy to use and perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to wait forever for their nails to dry.  Make sure that the base coat is tacky before you put the transfer on it and it comes out nearly perfect every time.</li>
    <li> The girlfriend was fairly satisfied with these foils, and said they were a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I was happy to get these. I can&#x27;t wait to use them this will be no first time ever using foil. .for the price ND the amount this is great for a beginner..Cannot wait to use them. ..thank you</li>
    <li> Colors choices were ok. Got 5 rolls that I will never use.</li>
    <li> I love the colors and designs of the foil and how great of a price it was! I have no complaints</li>
    <li> still learning how to use it, but it&#x27;s not bad.  The directions are not in English so when i first used it, I had to wing it.</li>
    <li> It worked but it only lasted for like a week. Not the best purchase. I would not recommend and it doesn&#x27;t work like it says it does.</li>
    <li> Now what I need to know is where do i get the glue from to apply it to my nail.</li>
    <li> foils look great, work great, however its a bit of a dissapointment that they didnt come with the nail foil glue. I got this as a present. Now its been sitting on my girlfriends shelf because she has no glue for it.  to top it off it arrived two months late, after having to resend it. No tracking, and first time it got lost.</li>
    <li> These are beautiful colors bright quite shimmery I would recommend</li>
    <li> The foils are a very low quality foil.  I received 10 of the same foil.  Most of them damaged because the foil is so thin.  I will always think twice if a product comes from  Eta Tech.</li>
    <li> Well, i have issue putting it on for my daughter, she is 6 and think this may have been little early for her, oh well.thanx</li>
    <li> I like usin these give the nail a different look</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic bargain! 12 bottles of foil, huge amount of foil in each bottle. The only issue was it took forever to arrive. If you are not in a hurry, this is the bargain of a lifetime!!! Beautiful colors, beautiful options!</li>
    <li> colors are lovely, but i am not sure which is the problem the glue or the paper</li>
    <li> I love what I got! It took about  two weeks to get here, I was estimated into may so I&#x27;m happy I got it sooner. I got a good selection, just a little sad I didn&#x27;t get gold. The containers alone are worth what I paid, (a little over four dollars), and are a score because I know I can reuse them for my acrylics. It also comes with a great amount in each foil container. Each foil was just about as wide as my queen size bed. (I was opening my mail in bed). Really love what I got!</li>
    <li> I love these foil!!  They work great and I love the variety of colors!!! I just need to get some glue so I can use them on more then just gel nails.</li>
    <li> I only got five colors in 12 tube things but oh well.</li>
    <li> Love these!! Works good! I bought them to use over my gel nail polish. You just cut a small section off and rub it to your nail with silver side down on the nail, pattern side up and boom! total cuteness. I get tons of compliment&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It was great except the one film was falling apart and it was the one i really wanted,so that was all that was wrong.</li>
    <li> These transfer great to nails so far. I have tried most colors, I have not tried a full nail application, just partial design and that is what I wanted this product for.</li>
    <li> Lovely foils. I&#x27;ve used them frequently with my gel manicure, since my purchase several months ago. Great product!</li>
    <li> I got mine in the mail a few days ago. I got different ones than the pictures so im fairly certain they are random. They don&#x27;t come with adhesive, but I didn&#x27;t find any that did, which is OK because i bought  best glue ever, which comes highly recommended by professionals. Which I use for my fimo canes and jewels tool. Its very multi use, and works well for the foils. However, this was the first time I&#x27;ve done foils and it was a bit difficult at first and frustrating so if this is new to you, prepare to have patience! The glue has to be just shy of dry, and you have to press down super hard. But I do love them otherwise!</li>
    <li> These came quickly and were exactly what I wanted. It was fun having the surprise of getting random colors. I didn&#x27;t end up with any that I truly hated.</li>
    <li> OKAY PRODUCT...MAKE SURE NAIL ADHESIVE DRIES CLEAR BEFORE APPLYING FOIL!</li>
    <li> I am having so much fun with these! Nice bright colors and easy to use. Shipped safely and quickly, too.</li>
    <li> havn&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but i&#x27;m so looking forward to it. if what I seen online is reliable this stuff will be amazing. shipping was fast..coming from over seas, and packaging was good. very happy!</li>
