<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I was looking for a lighter look for the summer and was thrilled with this set. It gives you the most natural look even in bright sun! I look like myself only better. The fact hat it&#x27;s good for your skin is also important. My skin can breathe! I&#x27;ll never go back to regular foundation. &lt;br /&gt;  The kit comes with three soft brushes , two different color mineral pots ( with an SPF of 15) and mineral veil which finishes the look. The kit also includes a bottle of Skin Rever Upper which gets your skin velvety and ready for the Bare minerals. &lt;br /&gt; Love the products,love the look!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels on my face. It is very light and you can reapply mineral veil as many times during the day as you need without looking caked on. I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I am really impressed with Bare Escentuals make-up!  It is so easy and fast to apply.  I am not impressed with the application brushes, they are very poor quality.  None the less, the make-up is great.  I had to buy some for my sister for Christmas!</li>
    <li> This makeup is the best. I will never go back to the traditional liquid foundation, pressed powder etc.  It looks great and it doesnt feel like your wearing makeup. My daughters, 18 and 21, are also using now.  What a difference, they no longer look \\&quot;made up\\&quot;, more of a natural look.  As far as coverage, depending on your skin situation, it covers well but if you have serious acne or scarring you may still want to use regular concealer (as my daughter does) under the mineral foundation for even better coverage. Another benefit is that a little of each of the minerals goes a long way.  I have now ordered some eyeshadow and liner and couldnt be more pleased.  This makeup lasts much longer throughout the day and helps control shine longer than traditional makeup/powders.  Love this product, Im hooked!</li>
    <li> I have been an Aveda Consumer since 1991 and I would like say that Bare Escentuals works just as well in the coverage department. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing alot of makeup, especially when using powders. I am interested to see how well B. E. holds up in the humidity. I have found that in the humidity, powders start to look cakey and runs. When using B. E., it does take a few applications to get the hang of applying the makeup. I do love how it covers your imperfications with little effort. I am currently unable to work so I don&#x27;t wear the makeup everyday to determine if it has improved my skin texture. I would like to see how this product holds up during the summer before I make future purchases.</li>
    <li> The product I received was exactly as advertised.  Delivery was within a week.  Price was good.  I would buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> This is probably perfect for the athletic, young skin that doesnt want a heavier product.  For my 30-something skin, prone to blemishes, this wasnt enough coverage for my liking.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you look like movie star like the infomercial but then again, I haven&#x27;t bought and tried the concealer kit either. I will though. If thiis product makes me look this good I can&#x27;t imagine what the concealer can do.  It&#x27;s very light and airy and stays on very well.    Love it!</li>
    <li> After using the Bare Escentuals makeup several times, I finally went back to my old brand. If your complexion is flawless, you might like this product. Being middle aged, I found that I was applying several layers to achieve the look I wanted; then I felt like I was wearing a mask. Not the feel I was after. The product (from the starter kit) I did like was the mineral veil. It puts the final touch on my face giving my old makeup a nice finish.</li>
    <li> I mean I love it anyway, but this make up makes it even more awesome!!! The brushes are sweet, the powder fountation kicks rump, the bronzer is HOTTT, and the mineral veil makes me want to kiss it.</li>
    <li> Been wanting to try this product for a couple years and finally did with great satisfaction.  Really good coverage, I&#x27;m most impressed with how well it covers acne without the cakey look you get from a liquid foundation.  Leaves a nice even toned finish.  Only complaint would be that it doesn&#x27;t stay on long enough.  You have to re-apply a couple times a day.</li>
    <li> I have tired regular cosmetics to Clinque and a few others and nothing tops this!!! Seriously you have to get it. It is a lot at once, but you only use a little at a time and well worth the money. I have gotten complimented on my skin sooo many times since I started wearing this. I even got the kit that&#x27;s called \\&quot;beyond the basics\\&quot; and I use it for eye shadows. They don&#x27;t have too many that are without sparkles so with this is looks natural and feels great!!!</li>
    <li> Normally, I am happy to go without make-up.  I was attracted to this product because of its all-natural mineral appeal.  I love the feeling of it.  At first when I received the package, I thought I made a bad deal, but just a little lasts all day.  I even wore it to bed the first night (as advertised) not wanting to be without that healthy mineral feeling, and when I woke up, I swear there was still a little coverage!  One day in a rush, I used my old brand of loose power and it felt like mud... yuck!  Now, that I&#x27;ve sprinkled minerals all over my face, I never want to use anything else...</li>
    <li> Easy to use and adapt to different skin types and textures.  Love this whole line of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Love this product. You don&#x27;t even feel the makeup on your skin at all. Like what the product says, less is more. The foundation, just a little amount makes my skin look good and flawless. I have sensitive skin and tried many products. So far, this product feels good on my skin without irritations.</li>
    <li> In january, my girlfriend&#x27;s car was broken into, and all of her makeup was stolen. (very odd, but it was in a pretty cool looking box, so i&#x27;m sure the crooks thought they were getting away with something sellable)    And as such she had to replace all of her make-up. Well, after doing some searching, i found the starter kit on amazon for a really good price, and it included a very good base to get her makeup kit back up and running.    She swears by this Bare Escentuals stuff, it is a very natural look, and she loves it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not hard, it&#x27;s light and it looks light. I&#x27;d used another popular name brand makeup for years, but due to a change in formula (and perhaps my hormones) found I had to mix colors and found the coverage to be heavy and uncomfortable. This gives great coverage for more than just minor discolorations. I bought the light color for my daughter for a gift and she loves it. She has minor acne, feels it covers the redness and is comfortable to wear. It seems to last forever, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for a couple of months and don&#x27;t see having to reorder for at least 2 months.</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals is the best makeup I have ever used.  It has never caused a problem and if I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face at night, I wake up looking great in the morning!  I LOVE this mineral based product!</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals is an awesome product.  It makes me look and feel great!!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This kit comes packed!  It is a great value for all that you get!  The brushes are wonderful and the makeup goes on so clean and soft.  I would recommend this kit to anyone trying bare minerals for the first time!</li>
    <li> I bought this makeup after noticing how my sister&#x27;s makeup always looked natural and even. I used to wear very little makeup, just spots of foundation where there were blemishes and powder, because I hated the way it felt at the end of the day. I would get shiny and greasy looking, and it would build up in the creases around my eyes. And the spots of foundation I would wear had to be blended in perfectly, otherwise would show.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now I wear this kit everyday. My skin looks awesome and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or gross at the end of the day. I never have to worry about blending it in, because it is all light powders that warms to your skin color and looks completely natural. I am now collecting all of the their products because they are truly amazing!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of powder makeup, but on really hot days - and we&#x27;ve had plenty - it isn&#x27;t heavy on my face.  I really like this.</li>
    <li> I highly reccomend this product! I&#x27;ve always had to watch what I put on my face and this is safe as can be. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and really does cover any flaws! I wish I&#x27;d have brought it sooner when the infomercials first came out.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat disappointed with the products. Coverage is less than I had hoped, and the brushes, in my opinion, are of low quality.</li>
    <li> I started with the Kit in 2000 and have been using it since.  In the past seven years I have had to modify what I use and where.  The Bisque works great around the eyes (and on the lids to get rid of discoloration and set the shadow).  I have tried it on other faces and didn&#x27;t notice the same results.  It seems to work better with light/medium skin tone and you have to apply color (warmth or another blush).   I can go from fresh and natural to dinner and dramatic in ten minutes with this.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I found Bare Essentials makeup to be good coverage for my skin and easy to apply. It does well in the heat of the Texas summer and you don&#x27;t need to touch it up as often as other makeup I have tried. It is worth the price. I would like to try their other products.</li>
    <li> As a \\&quot;50 something\\&quot; woman with dry skin, I was concerned that this product would accentuate my maturing skin&#x27;s fine lines - not so!  I feel and look like I&#x27;ve been airbrushed!  I&#x27;m still experimenting, but it seems less is better for me. I apply my moisturizer just before brushing on the Bare Escentuals.  This gives me a nice creamy feel and look.  Love it, love it love it!!!</li>
    <li> The product did not live up to what it had promissed. It does not cover very well, which is not a problem for me I did not buy it to cover anything on my skin. All I wanted was an even tone to my face which I never got. It dries my skin and appears cackey on my temples. The moisturizer causes my skin to breakout. I have not had any breakouts for as long as I remember untill I used this product. Sorry, It is not delivering what it has promissed.</li>
    <li> I find BE really great,can not see myself going back to my old foundation. &lt;br /&gt;I can not sleep with it though,my skin really did not like that.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best makeup I have EVER used.  People are stopping me to tell me how nice my skin is and what do I use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Bare Escentuals.  I don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy makeup on my face, and have never worn foundation because of it.  The Medium Beige powder foundation completely covers eye circles, pimples and redness from the shower.  I feel like I don&#x27;t have anything on at all.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I WILL NOT BUY NOTHING ELSE BUT BARE ESCENTUALS I&#x27;M 62 YEARS OLD AND NEVER  WORE MAKE UP BEFORE UNTIL MY STEPDAUGHTER GOT ME TO TRY IT, I&#x27;M HOOKED.  NOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS I BUY THREE PEOPLE IN MY LIFE THIS PRODUCT THEY  ARE JUST AS HOOKED AS I AM.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the quality of this product. Everything you have heard about it is so true.  The product does everything that the Infomercial on television says it does. I have allergies and this makeup is like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  You literally cannot feel it after application and it&#x27;s so easy to use and fast!!  The DVD that comes with it takes you through each step and gives closeups. I would recommend this to anyone.  I just wish this product would have been around when I was young and had troubled skin.  It&#x27;s also great for people that have skin problems. If you are tired of looking like you have makeup piled on your face, you should try this flawless makeup.  You definitely will be surprised.</li>
    <li> this is the best product i have used ever.  it doesn&#x27;t look like you even have make up on.  So natural.  Thanks</li>
    <li> If you are like me and you break out from makeup this is a must.  I just love this product and I have thrown all my other makeup away and I only use Bare Escentuals.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by other products saying they are a mineral makeup...buy only Bare Escentuals...it&#x27;s the best!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! The key to older skin using it is make sure you put moisturizer on under it so it don&#x27;t get creased in the little lines and pores. i have oily skin and i can sleep in this stuff with no \\&quot;ill\\&quot; effects in the morning.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  I would definitely reccommend anyone to buy this and use it!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t cover as well as I anticipated. It looked fine on my skin though. Didn&#x27;t have a cakey look. It looked natural. I will probably try the mineral makeup from Wal Mart before I will ever consider buying this. I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s worth the 60$. I just happened to get this product because I won enough points on another site. I would never spend the 60$ to buy it again though.</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using this product.  I have not broken out as often as I have in the past.  My face feels soft.  I live in Houston, with lots of humidity, plus my t-zone is a bit oily, but this product has been great.  Application is easy.</li>
    <li> I heard about Bare Escentuals from my sister in law, she has such nice skin I thought I would give it a try. Right after I started using it I got compliments on my skin too, People said I looked rested and healthy. I have dark circles, and two small scars and It covered them right up. It is expensive, but really nice, and It does go a long way. The brushs are excellent too. My favorite product it the Mineral Veil, it give your skin a smooth healthy glow.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many foundations including many different powder ones and this is by far the best product I&#x27;ve found.  Coverage is great and wears very light and comfortable.  Two days after getting it I recommended it to my mother.  She purchased it and fell it love with it too.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> It feels great on my face and I have gotten a lot of compliments on my skin.</li>
    <li> Bare Essentials is by far the best foundation ever.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my adult acne.  It provides even coverage.  It covers but doesn&#x27;t cake the face.  I suggest using the Mineral Veil UNDER the foundation if you get oily skin.</li>
    <li> It IS different than normal makeup..but unfortunately it still looked like a makeup mask on my face.  Also, you have to make sure to get your neck because otherwise the demarkation line on your jaw will appear (although the informercial and the included DVD said it wouldn&#x27;t).  Also, if you have dry skin or acne, it seems the accentuate the marks.  Finally, it is not good for shine coverage - I had to put a lot of mineral veil on in order to get rid of the shinyness on my forehead that still showed under the makeup.   &lt;br /&gt;It DID get rid of my undereye circles pretty well, and it did make my skin look a whole lot better than without anything at all.  Any of the above problems did not stop me from using the product daily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been seeing the infomercials for this make-up for years now.  I&#x27;d always wanted to try it, but never had until last month.    My skin is not flawless (I have rosacea, blotchy skin in some areas, and a few small acne scars), but when I applied this make-up, I felt like it was.  I&#x27;ve NEVER felt as beautiful as I do when I&#x27;m wearing this product.  It&#x27;s amazing!  The DVD in the box explains the application process step-by-step.  It actually takes me less time to apply than the thick, liquid foundation I was using before (which for me is a plus b/c I&#x27;m a busy mom of two young children), and I achieve incredible results.    I live in a hot &amp; humid climate, and this make-up stands up to it!  I can go out and run my errands in the humidity, and when I return home, my face still looks like I&#x27;ve just applied the make-up!  It&#x27;s gentle for sensitive skin like mine, and has actually improved my skin the longer I use it!    I&#x27;ll definitely be a Bare Escentuals customer for life!</li>
    <li> I love this makeup!  I have rosacea and have had no results from topical treatments prescribed by my dermatologist.  I was skeptical about Bare Minerals&#x27; claim of lessening the appearance of rosacea; I just bought it for the makeup.  It turns out, their claim was not so far-fetched!  It actually has started to reverse my rosacea!  In the month that I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals my rosacea has decreased the level of redness in my face back to where it was 2 years ago!  I&#x27;ll never use any other kind of makeup again!</li>
    <li> This is a great way to try this product. Everything you need is included--two shades of makeup, finishing powder, brushes, and even a cd to guide you through your first application.</li>
    <li> This kit is an excellent value!  All items are useable---unlike some previous kits I have ordered.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for longer coverage, but all in all I am extremely satisfied with this make-up.  It evens out my skin tone and covers my blemishes.  It is also sort of fun to apply.</li>
    <li> wow, I really thought I would love this and boy what a let down. I Have tried this product five times (each time thinking maybe it would get better) and each time I followed the the instructions. It offered little if any coverage  even when I used layered applications with the concealer brush and the mineral  veil had kind of  a weird white film to it. I have oily skin and the makeup was completely gone in a hour no matter how much if it I applied and reapplied. If you have oily skin, save your money and buy something that isn&#x27;t completely useless.</li>
    <li> I had been thinking of getting this makeup for a while.  I started having problems with my skin and decided now would be a great time to try it out.  I am amazed how well my skin looks, even when the makeup is removed.  My skin looks great with it on or off!  It&#x27;s a lot easier to use than I initially thought. The makeup is very natural looking and it also conceals great! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I really really really love this makeup.  I was so tired of using the liquid foundation and having to wash my hands 3 or 4 times to get it all off.  My mom ordered Bare Escentuals last year and really liked it so I decided to try it as an alternative.  I have to say that it is probably the best foundation I have used.  I even notice that if I&#x27;m in a situation where I&#x27;m perspiring, as long as I don&#x27;t wipe it, it stays on.  No running down my face or getting on my clothes!  I even got complimented on how tan I was looking.  And as a concealer, it works wonders.  Thanks Bare Escentuals!!</li>
    <li> This is a good product for people who don&#x27;t like heavy make-up.  I will wear only what is in this kit, the foundation, some warmth on the cheeks, then the mineral veil for a glow, then maybe some chap-stick.  very low maintenance, and it stays on all day.  Plus it does not clog up your pores!  Everything you need is included and it even has a dvd on how-to.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing testimonies from friends about these products for a few years, but never wanted to spend the money for a product I&#x27;m not already using (foundation). But I have a new job and am looking for some more makeup coverage- and this is perfect. My product arrived quickly and in excellent shape. I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t be using their products again since not only did they not assist me and cancel one of the erroneous orders (which was a duplicate) and save the shipping (which was so inefficient) but it will take them a full six weeks to refund me!!</li>
