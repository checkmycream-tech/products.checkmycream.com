      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
      <li>Kind of a nuisance,</li>
      <li>This product is great for holding fine hair done with a curling iron, I would even use it for a roller set that goes under a dryer for more hold.  </li>
      <li>A very good product at a price i was willing to pay... who could expect more?</li>
      <li>Sets my VERY fine hair for curling/waving, etc.</li>
      <li>I love this spray.</li>
      <li>the price is fair for this and definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite Redken hair styling products.</li>
      <li>Has a pleasant, light scent that fades quickly.</li>
      <li>Better to spray each section lightly before you use your styling tool or rollers.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl unless I use a hair styling product to help it along.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair with zero body.</li>
      <li>I love Hot Sets 22 becausse</li>
      <li>Good product, keeps curl and body especially for fine or thinning hair.</li>
      <li>Most products that are for thermal protection are really meant for flat ironing and have a lot of oils or silicone added to it, but not so great for holding in curling iron sets.  </li>
      <li>my hair looks good until the next day.</li>
      <li>This works great for my fine limp hair.  </li>
      <li>This product has HOLD and thermal protection (I use a very hot curling irons at work) which is what I need when I am setting my customers&#x27; hair</li>
      <li>Goes on easily and really locks in the curl; for use with a curling iron.</li>
      <li>I spray the root, curl, add paste wax &amp; fluff, I&#x27;m good to go</li>
      <li>(or super crispy from how much hairspray i needed to keep them curled for a max 3 hrs)</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t get the same sleek look with the incredible hold that the other provided.  </li>
      <li>I first used it 13 years ago, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for several years.  </li>
      <li>Really smelled like mold!</li>
      <li>I bought this product to use as a styling aid with hot rollers.</li>
      <li>I could start curling my hair and by the time I was done, the first section I curled would be completely straight.</li>
      <li>Try not to spray too much on so that your hair isn&#x27;t over saturated.</li>
      <li>I have really straight hair that no amount of product will hold curls longer then an hour.</li>
      <li>Really works well to create volume and lift while using a roller hair drier.</li>
      <li>It actually makes my curls look and move more natural instead of in chunks like hair spray does.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it is SUPER sticky, but hopefully that will give it good hold.</li>
      <li>The trouble women will go through to for decent hair...:-)</li>
      <li>With this product I usually spray it on right before using the curling iron, curl my hair and then use a  light misting of hairspray.  </li>
      <li>It only takes a very light spritz/spray, apply the hot curling iron for a few seconds, and that&#x27;s it!</li>
      <li>my hair does not usually curl, even if i don&#x27;t wash it for a couple days.</li>
      <li>I tried the Hot Sets 22, hoping it would be the same, but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>I am looking for the old redken &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; spray.  </li>
      <li>If I make a customer&#x27;s hair too SOFT</li>
      <li>The older generation of women DO NOT like soft hair sets but the younger generation does.  </li>
      <li>My only complaint is that Redken has changed the formula for the Hot Sets 22 Thermal Setting Mist and now, it sticks to my curling iron which requires that I clean it after each use.  </li>
      <li>I guess that goes back to the old shampoo and set days where women were used to helmet head hairstyles lasting week to week.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this spray for several months and started developing bumps on the top of my head where my hair is thin.</li>

<li> In the past, I would spray it with hairspray then use a curling iron on it.  </li>
<li> If I used enough spray to keep the set, then my hair was stiff and I hate stiff hair.  </li>
<li> Not a good idea to spray it all over your head and then try to get a comb through it.</li>
<li> Seriously wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
<li> Unfortunate  :-(  </li>
<li> WRONG!</li>

    <li> I have been using this spray for several months and started developing bumps on the top of my head where my hair is thin. Also smaller bumps around my face where the hair touched it. When I stopped using this spray my bumps went away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, It works the best with my hair. Love it. Keeps the ends of my hair from drying out using my curling iron.</li>
    <li> A very good product at a price i was willing to pay... who could expect more?</li>
    <li> Really works well to create volume and lift while using a roller hair drier. I love it!</li>
    <li> It is the same product sold in hair salons and is cheaper. Try not to spray too much on so that your hair isn&#x27;t over saturated.</li>
    <li> The bottle I received was not the same bottle pictured, it was actually pink, but it said the same thing so I thought it would work. WRONG! It actually made curling my hair harder and would hold a curl in at all... disappointed to say the least as this particular spray was highly recommended by my hairstylist.</li>
    <li> I love Hot Sets 22 becausse it works for my hair &amp; helps it look fuller.  Best hair spray ever!</li>
    <li> my hair does not usually curl, even if i don&#x27;t wash it for a couple days. this worked wonders for me. the curls had to be brushed out some, or they&#x27;d of stayed Shirley Temple like. the price is fair for this and definitely worth it. it is somewhat a pain to get out, but i just wash my hair twice and it comes out.</li>
    <li> This works great for my fine limp hair.  It&#x27;s still a lot of work to spray on and then use the curling iron but it works! The trouble women will go through to for decent hair...:-)</li>
    <li> Sets my VERY fine hair for curling/waving, etc. and holds forever, which is something that is tough for me to find for my particular hair.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am a hairstylist and I needed to find a product to replace a product I have been using for years that was discontinued.  Most products that are for thermal protection are really meant for flat ironing and have a lot of oils or silicone added to it, but not so great for holding in curling iron sets.  This product has HOLD and thermal protection (I use a very hot curling irons at work) which is what I need when I am setting my customers&#x27; hair (even mine).  If I make a customer&#x27;s hair too SOFT the set will not last a day or more, and that makes for a very unhappy customer!  This product is great for holding fine hair done with a curling iron, I would even use it for a roller set that goes under a dryer for more hold.  The older generation of women DO NOT like soft hair sets but the younger generation does.  I guess that goes back to the old shampoo and set days where women were used to helmet head hairstyles lasting week to week.  I just wish this product was a little cheaper, the other product I was using was a lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use as a styling aid with hot rollers. My only complaint is that it is SUPER sticky, but hopefully that will give it good hold. Not a good idea to spray it all over your head and then try to get a comb through it. Better to spray each section lightly before you use your styling tool or rollers. Seems to add lots of volume to hair as well. Has a pleasant, light scent that fades quickly.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Goes on easily and really locks in the curl; for use with a curling iron. It only takes a very light spritz/spray, apply the hot curling iron for a few seconds, and that&#x27;s it!</li>

    <li> I am looking for the old redken &amp;#34;sets&amp;#34; spray.  I first used it 13 years ago, but haven&#x27;t been able to find it for several years.  I think it was probably discontinued.  I tried the Hot Sets 22, hoping it would be the same, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I couldn&#x27;t get the same sleek look with the incredible hold that the other provided.  Unfortunate  :-(  I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> Good product, keeps curl and body especially for fine or thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Really smelled like mold!</li>
    <li> I could start curling my hair and by the time I was done, the first section I curled would be completely straight. (or super crispy from how much hairspray i needed to keep them curled for a max 3 hrs) Now I can go all day running my fingers through my hair and have curly hair all day long. It&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
    <li> Seriously wouldn&#x27;t use anything else! Great for spraying pieces before rolling hair. Awesome product for pageants!</li>
    <li> I received this product when promised and it was in excellent condition.  My only complaint is that Redken has changed the formula for the Hot Sets 22 Thermal Setting Mist and now, it sticks to my curling iron which requires that I clean it after each use.  Kind of a nuisance, but I need a setting product to hold the curl--which this one does.</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin, limp hair.  Yeah, not what I wanted but that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve got!  In the past, I would spray it with hairspray then use a curling iron on it.  If I used enough spray to keep the set, then my hair was stiff and I hate stiff hair.  With this product I usually spray it on right before using the curling iron, curl my hair and then use a  light misting of hairspray.  Guess what, the curl holds and my hair looks good until the next day.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine hair with zero body. I spray the root, curl, add paste wax &amp; fluff, I&#x27;m good to go</li>
    <li> This is a product that does well for my hair.  I have fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold a curl unless I use a hair styling product to help it along. This is one of my favorite Redken hair styling products.</li>
