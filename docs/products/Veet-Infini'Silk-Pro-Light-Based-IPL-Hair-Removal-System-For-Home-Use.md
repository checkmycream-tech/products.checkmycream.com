      <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with the progress.</li>
      <li>A systematic approach is best because it does take time.</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Also, you have to shave before you use it, and I have noticed that it works best for me when I shave and then wait 1 or 2 days before I use the Veet.</li>
      <li>The best way to do this is to start at the ankle and work around your leg.</li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>This thing is awesome.</li>

      <li>My legs are looking very good with about 4 treatments</li>
      <li>Ideally, you use this for an extended period of time 6+ weeks and it will cause hair to return a lot finer or not at all.</li>

      <li>Good experience</li>
      <li>Perhaps, I am not as good at this as I thought.</li>

      <li>The GOOD news is that Amazon now sells the cartridges for purchase online</li>
      <li>Laser window is good size</li>
      <li>it works, surprisingly well, and I would recommend this to anyone with hair removal needs.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for 2 months and it incredibly worked on me :)</li>
      <li>The GOOD news is that Amazon now sells the cartridges for purchase online</li>
      <li>The light is very bright when u push the button, so I just close my eyes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So about another 30 days have gone by and I am still very pleased with the product (it would be a shame if I had to trade it in for a Tria because I can&#x27;t get replacement cartridges).</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>(this is way more than suggested) since Christmas, and the results are amazing!  </li>
      <li>the devise is easy to use and I look forward to great results.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>Still, this is AMAZING</li>
      <li>The majority of my leg hair is just gone and I am thrilled.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of digging this thing.</li>
      <li>The majority of my leg hair is just gone and I am thrilled.</li>
      <li>It had a safety feature which prevents using it unless its against a surface that is nice if you have kids around, probably damaging to eyes.  </li>
      <li>Honestly, just buy the Tria.</li>
      <li>but I want to be honest.</li>
      <li>Do this at your own risk, of course.</li>
      <li>I went rouge and didn&#x27;t follow the usage instructions and set my own schedule to use the Veet system.</li>
      <li>But it would be nice if Amazon offered the replacement cartridges too.</li>
      <li>Honestly, just buy the Tria.</li>
      <li>Nice unit, just not built for diabetics</li>
      <li>Honestly, I have no idea, nor do I intend to use it for nine months to find out.  </li>
      <li>Sun glasses might be a good idea just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>That said the \\&quot;gun\\&quot; seems effective.  </li>
      <li>but I want to be honest.</li>
      <li>Anyway, Sharon was very nice, apologized profusely, and offered me free expedited shipping.</li>
      <li>It is extremely bright and you want to make sure you are either wearing laser safe glasses, or you look away.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and hold.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to cover a good bit of skin at one time.</li>
      <li>But the design of this makes it easy to see where you just were and move in a good pattern.</li>
      <li>I found the instruction for this product very easy to follow and very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s ok though, because I&#x27;m still 100% satisfied with my purchase!</li>
      <li>The Tria is looking better and better!</li>
      <li>So far, I am very happy with my purchase, and I can say YES</li>
      <li>far I am very happy with this product as I&#x27;ve had no pain and</li>
      <li>the light is bright, you have to look away</li>
      <li>but it is one bright light for sure.  </li>
      <li>The first 3 were in 2003 and they worked great</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m aware it may take some time for full results to be noticeable, but I&#x27;m pleased with what I have experienced so far.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
      <li>This is surprisingly easy to use and effective.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t accurately rate the Veet Infini-Silk (oy) Pro Light-Based Ipl Hair Removal System for Home Use (whew!)</li>
      <li>This has been the best product I have bought to help remove my unwanted facial hair.</li>
      <li>I wanted to make sure I could see where the marks were.</li>
      <li>However, the booklet says top do rows.</li>
      <li>After going through laser treatment myself and being pleased (but not $1,000 pleased) with the results, I wanted to test out a home laser system.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m really pleased with the progress.  </li>
      <li>I have no doubts that had I been able to keep to the suggested time frame</li>
      <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t put that lotion on your legs when you get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I feel hear and the most pain I ever feel is like an elastic band snapping on my skin.</li>
      <li>I was able to tolerate five, without any discomfort on my legs</li>
      <li>Yes, I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I have hair on 2 toes on each foot and some on the top of my foot.</li>
      <li>Fingers crossed for more improvements to report in two weeks.    </li>
      <li>I returned it because Groupon has better deals in my area.</li>
      <li>I will update after two more uses.    </li>
      <li>: 3 stars&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will update when I am able to use this.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This has been the best product I have bought to help remove my unwanted facial hair. Due to PCOS I HAD very coarse black hair on my chin and neck area as well as fine black hair on my sideburn area (my sideburn area had been previously lasered by the doctor, so the fine hair was re growth). I purchased the Veet machine because I was desperate for an affordable but convenient solution to my very embarrassing problem. I would have to shave daily before using the Veet system, as well as always having to look out for stubborn ingrown hairs. What woman wants to shave her face!! I received my machine in Feburary, it is now April and all my treated problem areas are down to a 90% reduction hair growth and density.  I went rouge and didn&#x27;t follow the usage instructions and set my own schedule to use the Veet system. I did a treatment every 2 days instead of the once a week recommendation. Now because I don&#x27;t need it I only use it once a month for maintenance . I didn&#x27;t have to buy replacement cartridges either! Overall this product is a lifesaver. I can walk around and not feel like the bearded lady from a side show act. Things to consider: My skin is white and my hair was black. I started on lowest setting and worked myself up to full blast. Be smart! Test your skin area! Don&#x27;t risk getting burned because you are not careful. Blonde hairs will remain the same.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for 2 months and it incredibly worked on me :) I was not expecting this result but it is totally worth for this price.No shame! No pain at all! I definitely recommend this product to everyone!</li>
    <li> I am Hispanic with light olive skin, no tan, black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had 6 laser treatments in the past. The first 3 were in 2003 and they worked great but I was unable to finish the treatments because the laser tech went on maternity leave. In 2005 I did one more laser treatment in Las Vegas and it burned my skin so I did not try again until 2008. I did 2 very painful laser treatments in 2008 and had to quit when I became pregnant. So when I saw the TV ad for Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Pro I decided to take a chance and try it for 60 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Laser window is good size&lt;br /&gt;- good price (if it really works)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-There is really no way to make sure u don&#x27;t miss a spot or double laser a spot, the dents don&#x27;t work all the time, and in some areas where u wont be able to get a visual.&lt;br /&gt;- once you hit the trigger u have to wait 5 seconds for the laser to work again. I wish it would just pulse automatically.&lt;br /&gt;- the light is bright, you have to look away&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIRST USE: 11/9/2014&lt;br /&gt;Received it in the mail, read the simple instructions, did my legs, bikini and underarm area. I used it in the lowest setting because I was unsure of how my skin would react.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN: just a little heat, nothing painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair grew back without any change, same amount, not thinner, not lighter, not slower, nothing :(&lt;br /&gt;Skin did not react, no bumps or burns&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SECOND USE: 11/23/2014&lt;br /&gt;This time I decided to go to level 5 on my lower legs , 4 on upper legs, level 3 bikini and underarms and 4 in arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN: had to practice breathing exercises in upper thighs and underarms. nothing bad enough that would stop me from doing it again and definitely LESS than the professional treatments where I had to buy a numbing cream and they used the cool air immediately after the zap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIRD USE: 12/6/2014:&lt;br /&gt;I took 2 advils got some ice packs and got to work. Level 5 or nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN: Level 5 was a little uncomfortable but not painful on my lower legs, very very very painful on my knees, breathing exercises needed in inner thighs and icing required in bikini area. By the time I made it to my underarms I chickened out and did level 4, which was painful but since its so quick, I could manage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS as of 12/10/2014:&lt;br /&gt;wow! A big area on the inside and outside of my outer leg has no hair. I cant believe it. The rest of my lower leg has less hair but it&#x27;s not thinner and it does not grow any slower. I compared my results today with my co-worker&#x27;s (who is also hispanic, same skin/hair color, same amount of hair) professional-laser results and we were both surprised at how similar both our results were. My co-worker has been doing professional laser for some time, I think she said she had 4 laser treatments on her lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thighs: less hair, but not thinner and not growing slower. There are no big patches of hairless skin like my lower legs but since this is my first time doing level 5 on thighs I am assuming results will come with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bikini: no change at all. Underarms: definitely NO change at all. Arms: did my left arm and not my right arm so i can compare results, as of now, no change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/14/14: AWESOME!  I do have places in my bikini area where hair has not grown back yet. I shaved my lower legs on Friday and it has been 2 days and its completely smooth. Before using the laser, I would feel the prickly hairs growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am ordering a 5% Lidocaine here on amazon so I can be ready for next treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTES: I had to change the cartridge already! :(  I also had serious issues doing my bikini area cuz its hard to figure out which area you already zapped without overlapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised that the laser worked in my lower legs where the hair is coarse, instead of thinner hair in my thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update to come in 4 weeks...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DECEMBER 6, 2015&lt;br /&gt;So in January 2015 I had to order new cartridges. Took me a while so I did not get to it until March 2015. Then I had some back problems and finally had spine surgery in October 2015. I could not bend over or sit in an awkward position so I could not continue the laser treatment for most of 2015. All the hair grew back 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I restarted the treatments today. I did legs and bikini (brazilian) setting 5 today, will update in four weeks HOPEFULLY!sition so I could not continue the laser treatment for most of 2015. All the hair grew back 100%.   I restarted the treatments today. I did legs and bikini (brazilian) setting 5 today, will update in four weeks HOPEFULLY!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 6 weeks now.  I can already see about a 50% reduction.  Will update this post in another 6 weeks.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Be patient it will take a couple of months to get results.  Start using it during the winter since you should not expose the skin to the sun (no tanning) afterwards.  I was tired of shaving and waxing and this has been a very nice product to have.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first, but after using the product a few times already I can clearly see some results. I&#x27;m aware it may take some time for full results to be noticeable, but I&#x27;m pleased with what I have experienced so far.&lt;br /&gt;Wow!</li>
    <li> This works really well, I wanted to try the no no product but the reviews were not good. Got this at Christmas with a discount and have noticed a definite improvement in the growth of hair on my legs. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all even on the strongest setting.</li>
    <li> Well, maybe I just got really unlucky but after about 5 zaps, the device no longer works. The fan won&#x27;t turn on, there are 2 blinking green lights, and an orange light is on as opposed to a green light that should be on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instrucions carefully and can&#x27;t figure out what happened. The lights that are blinking? No explanation in the manual for that. Orange light? No explanation for the either. The troubleshooting page in the manual is very vague. I looked online to see if others had this issue and it seems like either I am the only one, or it is too new for there to be much public information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so frustrating! I will update this review after I call their customer service and/or Amazon to try and figure out what is going on...</li>
    <li> It works!  I am not very hairy to begin with, but I hate shaving under my arms and my legs.  I always seem to miss spots.  I&#x27;ve been using the Veet system for 2 months and I haven&#x27;t shaved in over a week!  There is no hair to shave!  I admit I am impatient, so I&#x27;ve been using it more than the instructions say, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative effects at all.  One of my best beauty purchases.  It saved me from having laser hair removal at the dermatologist.</li>
    <li> I love it! It truly works if your have patience and are persistent.</li>
    <li> I will continue to keep updating as I go along. I first received this about a month ago. So far I am happy with the results. First- it is very easy to use. I have no problems starting it up. Instructions were easy to follow with minimal up front work. For the record, I have dark hair with very pale skin (year round pale).&lt;br /&gt;First treatment- I decided to do only part of left leg. I wanted to make sure I could see where the marks were. I was afraid of overlapping. So I shaved one stripe and went to work on that part of my lower left leg. One treatment at level 4 and results were very impressive. 4 weeks later and you can certainly tell where I started my work. I also only did my left underarm. Less hair growing back and much slower growth than my right underarm. I also started on my (you guessed it) left bikini area. Now from years of waxing, I already have a patchy bikini area, but I can certainly see a larger difference moving in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second treatment- I am impatient, so I did not wait the full 2 weeks. It was closer to 1 week. I shaved both underarms and did them both. The difference between my underarms was very very noticeable by this point. I have started using level 5 on my underarms. I also decided to give my whole left leg a go. I completed the whole session. I did move up to a 5 here as well. Pain is barely noticeable except on my knees and very oddly, my tattoos. I have 2 ankle tattoos and one is an anklet going all around my left ankle. I have decided that I will not be using this on my tattoo any longer. The pain was crazy. I was not happy after 1 zap and decided to knock it back to 2. I was still gritting my teeth so decided to not do anymore over my tattoo. I did my entire bikini line again. I am happy with these results. I can see a difference. I can feel a difference. As others have said, i am quite patchy. I am not sure exactly why. Perhaps, I am not as good at this as I thought. I may be missing places. I am going to stick with it though.This is the best at home product I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third treatment- I have now done both legs, whole bikini area, and both underarms. No results as I have just finished, but will update.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it 4 times 2 weeks aapart and have not noticed any change in hair yet. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> No complaints. Haven&#x27;t had time to use it at it&#x27;s full potential.  For the time I have it&#x27;s definitely made a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> Love. So easy to use and I am seeing results!</li>
    <li> I bought this product feeling very skeptical but I definitely wanted to try it. The product does exactly what it says it will! Let me start out by saying that I have very dark and coarse leg hair. Typically if I use a new razor in the morning by the end of the night I will have noticeable stubble. Or as my husband so fondly calls it.. spears... LOL... I followed the instructions and started on a lower setting and have gradually moved up the intensity. The only part of the instructions I haven&#x27;t followed is how often I&#x27;m using it. I was using it weekly for the first 5 sessions, and have now gone to every other week. By week 3 I had already noticed a huge difference in how my hair was coming back. Not only is my hair growing at a much slower rate but I actually have bald spots where hair hasn&#x27;t grown back at all! As for how it feels when you use it, it&#x27;s a slight pinching sensation that lasts for less than a second. The higher the intensity the more &#x27;pinchy&#x27; it feels. I&#x27;m up to level 5 and it isn&#x27;t anything to write home about. The underarms and bikini area are a little more sensitive to it but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint; there isn&#x27;t any sort of consistency of regrowth. For instance, on one leg the hair around my ankle doesn&#x27;t grow back, but on the other leg it does. Is that a product issue? No, I do not think so. I think that&#x27;s just how my body is responding to the treatments for whatever reason. It also seems as though my bikini line and underarms haven&#x27;t responded as well as my legs have. That&#x27;s ok though, because I&#x27;m still 100% satisfied with my purchase! If you are tired of shaving and want a more permanent solution, you have to try this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past month and have definitely less growth!  It is worth the price just for the improvement on my bikini line!  No more thick ingrown hairs after shaving.  (TMI, sorry). The only negative I have is that I used it twice in my lower legs (knee to ankle) and my bikini line and the cartridge needed changed after one leg the 3rd use.  I definitely didn&#x27;t get 5,000 flashes out of it.  :/. Hopefully it was just a bad cartridge and he next one will last a little longer.</li>
    <li> So far only two stars...I used it for more than a month and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference on the hair on my legs, I see a 5% reduction on the hair on my bikini area and like a 10% reduction on my underarms.I will continue to use it and update my review later.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in the beginning of December. I have used it three times so far and I have noticed slowing of hair in the treated area. I have light skin and dark hair. Purchased through Amazon like this you DO NOT get an extra light cartridge. Once i received and realized this I contacted Amazon directly and they gave me a few options and I chose to have a percentage of my money which I was happy with because it cost less then purchasing it directly through Veet. I am not a paid reviewer at all. I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to see permanent results though.  EDIT: I have to say after having used this about 5 times ( I lost track of a couple of treatments) I did go over the recommended length of time. I have noticed some hopefully permanent results. I use this on my stomach and bikini area. Hair has growth has definitely slowed and on my bikini line I have noticed patches of hair where the growth has stopped. I am definitely continuing to use this product it has helped and is much cheaper then laser removal professionally done. I will be purchasing a replacement cartridge just so I don&#x27;t have to wait to continue use for the future when I need it.</li>
    <li> I though it was effective the first a few time. But now after just 20 days the cartridge change light is on. It really does not make sense to pay $ 79 every 20 days.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference. I haven&#x27;t noticed any major reduction in hair growth. I suppose actual permanent hair removal wasn&#x27;t expected, but for the amount of money I paid for the Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Pro, I expected much better results than what I&#x27;ve gotten after 2 months of dedicated use.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Veet Infini&#x27;Silk Pro on Dec, 18, 2014 and received it on Dec. 23rd. I purposely bought the Pro version in order to be able to replace the pulse cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin and brown hair. I had been waxing with sugar wax for at least the last 5 years because I hated constant shaving. I completed the first treatment on Dec. 30th.  I read all the instructions for the device before the 1st use and then proceeded to shave in order to begin the treatments. I hate to say it but there was plenty to shave because, due to the prior cooler summer and working full time, it had been more that 6 months since my last waxing of my legs. I started the treatment at level 1 but after a few pulses, I quickly moved it up to level 5. I completed the treatment on my legs and underarms. As a side note, in the past, I especially hated dealing with underarm hair. I went to waxing because I have a couple of raised moles or skin tags in my underarms that I didn&#x27;t want to nick with a razor. Even with waxing, I always needed my daughter to help me because it hurt so much more and was less effective when I did it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now completed 4 treatments with the device, 12/27, 1/11, 1/25, and 2/8. I showed my legs to my husband this morning and told him it had been two weeks since I had last shaved and he was very impressed! There was no hair to be seen! If I looked closely, I could find a random hair here and there and I could feel a bit of stubble. My underarms are pretty much the same with maybe a little more stubble. The majority of any hair left is on the backs of my legs in the calf region where I could easily have been not as accurate on hitting every spot for treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I want to tell you what I have been doing, especially anything that doesn&#x27;t follow the instructions exactly. My skin may not be as sensitive as yours so please keep that in mind as you read this. I already said that after pulsing 3 or 4 spots I increased the Infini&#x27;Silk to level 5 on the first treatment. I used it at that level everywhere, even though some areas I may have felt more of a sting or more heat when I added more sensitive areas. Any discomfort went away within a few minutes. For the second treatment on January 11, I made some changes. First, I added my upper lip to the treatment regimen. The day before I had experienced my first (and last!) threading of my eyebrows and they did my upper lip too - I did not know there could be so much pain! During the Infini&#x27;Silk treatment, I would close my eyes before each pulse. I felt the sting here at level 5, but again, it was tolerable and went away after 10-15 minutes. Second, I also added the bikini line with the same level of discomfort (but if it works, it&#x27;s worth  it!). Finally, the most important change is that I decided not to worry about overlap in any of the areas I treat. When I do my legs, I move the device a very small amount between each pulse. It is more important to me to make sure that I do not miss any spots. Also, treating in this manner, I don&#x27;t have to look at the device and then look away before the pulse. I can just close my eyes through the whole line of treatment or look somewhere else. I wish I could arrange it so I could read a book while treating! I am sure that there is plenty of overlap but I have not experienced any ill effects. The biggest issue I have is treating the back of my legs where I can&#x27;t see if I have covered every spot. This is due to the natural curve of the calf. Even if you are treating in a straight line, the calves need more treatments to cover all of the surface area and, as careful as I try to be, I obviously miss some spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as of 2/22, I have completed 4 treatments on my legs and 3 treatments on my upper lip and bikini line. While my legs are not perfect, they are most definitely hair-free enough that I could easily run around in shorts and no one would know the difference (if it weren&#x27;t so horribly cold). I have family birthdays to go to today and I plan to show my female relatives the results I have gotten so far. I will complete another treatment this evening. Oh, one more point...I plan to continue my treatments at the every two week interval until the bikini line and all other hair doesn&#x27;t seem to be coming back at all. If there is a negative health consequence to doing this (or, for example, treating the upper lip), the company should state what it is. I have searched and found nothing and I am one that wants to know the why. If it will hurt me, I won&#x27;t do it. If I am seeing no ill effects and have been given no information on possible problems, I see no reason stop treatments that are working.</li>
    <li> broken in 3 month, and i have changed the replacement part still doesn&#x27;t work!!!</li>
    <li> It works!  The treatment process takes many weeks (translation: months), but a home product that works is worth its weight in gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;• Convenience!  Did my treatments at odd hours with NO planning or appointments&lt;br /&gt;• The discomfort (pain) is very small compared to waxing or electrolysis (which is REALLY bad). I felt only a small snap about 30% of the time.&lt;br /&gt;• Price is MUCH less than professional laser treatments which makes the treatment available to regular people.&lt;br /&gt;• The treatment head is larger than the other more expensive devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;• The light is very bright despite the nozzle being pressed firmly against my skin. Consider purchasing eye protection at the same time.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Its been 4 treatments and the hair growth is significantly down. Love it.</li>
    <li> It takes time to effect, for me, it takes three month, so if you are going to use it, take patient.</li>
    <li> Pain to use. Returned</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and I am on my 2nd treatment, and what a difference. I am mixed white and black and it works perfect for me.</li>
    <li> We both use it - my wife&#x27;s axillary and bikini hair (coarse, dark, olive skin) already thinned out after 1 application, same with my back hair. (gray, very white skin). Some areas of the body tend to need more treatments than others.&lt;br /&gt;We got it for $249 with an extra cartridge here on Amazon a couple of months ago-the price must be going up-, and it has already been worth the money, considering it would cost $3K at a spa or dermatologist&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Both of use were able to use level 5 with only some warm, tingly feeling, but no pain at all. Once you got the hang of it, you easily figure out how fast you can apply it and how to follow the grid. So far wife has had 2 full body applications, and I&#x27;ve had a back application, and we&#x27;re still on the first cartridge. Recommend sticking to instructions.</li>
    <li> It is working perfectly thank you</li>
    <li> So far I feel it was a big waste of money...</li>
    <li> I returned this item.  Why?  A friend was doing the pulsing for me, and she got about a third of the way done with my back when the bulb inside burned out.  About 30 flashes.  SO not worth it.  Spend the extra money and let a professional do it.</li>
    <li> This may work for some people . It have my bruises on my legs on the lowest setting. Returned it.</li>
    <li> Nice unit, just not built for diabetics</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since May, 2015 and received fast results but when I turned it on today it exploded on my face on about 10th shock! Pieces of broken glass are everywhere! It was too loud I would go deaf! Thanks god I didn&#x27;t get hurt! They need to take this problem seriously!!! And fix it!!! I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s been so long but guys please be careful!!</li>
    <li> This thing scared the heck out of me. When charged and ready to go it sends out a crazy flash light and then you smell burning hair. I used it multiple times and have not seen a change. Plus, the whole thing kind of gives me anxiety because that light is BRIGHT. I discontinued this because I found it painful and too tedious.    Ideally, you use this for an extended period of time 6+ weeks and it will cause hair to return a lot finer or not at all. If you&#x27;re really looking into a home hair removal, this may be what you&#x27;re looking for but make sure you read all the fine print and warnings.</li>
    <li> I got rashes on my skin after first treatment. Have returned it back.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now. For what it is worth, the Veet system is easy to use and, thus far, I have very few complaints about it. However, it also a little early to tell for certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my thoughts so far...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Well built / Easy to use and hold.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to cover a good bit of skin at one time. Can hold down the button to continuously use, which is nice when doing larger areas like the legs.&lt;br /&gt;The bulb is replaceable, which is actually a pro and con.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can be time consuming to use. It will take you multiple sessions on areas to see (or hope to see) any results.&lt;br /&gt;The bulb is replaceable. However, at this time, I am unable to locate the cost or where I would be able to purchase a replacement bulb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I continue to use the product, I will keep this review updating.</li>
    <li> To start, if you&#x27;re thinking that you can buy this, zap your hair over the weekend, and be smooth-skinned...not quite.  The recommended number of treatments is about 10 (slightly more or less depending on hair color), with them being approximately four weeks apart.  Yep - 10 treatments over about nine months.  After all of that, they say to expect between 55% and 70% hair reduction depending on hair color and area on the body.  They also state the typical full growth cycle for a hair follicle is 18-24 months, over which multiple session may be required to achieve permanent results.  So, not for the impatient or the perfectionist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of cautions and possible side effects is pretty intimidating, so you may want to try and view the manual online before purchasing to make sure you are comfortable using this.  The biggest one that stood out to me (especially because it&#x27;s summer time right now) is that you should not use this on tanned skin, and you should avoid exposure to the sun after using this.  You are supposed to avoid sun exposure for four weeks prior to using this.  That&#x27;s pretty tough here in Tucson, but it might work fine for those of you during winter months in colder climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is fairly easy to use, but it can take a while depending on where you want to use it.  The treatment zone (the exposed flash area) is about 1.25\\&quot; by 0.5\\&quot;, and you need to move that over the area you want to treat, pausing and flashing along the way.  That takes a little time, and it will leave temporary marks at every flash location (intentionally to help you keep track of where you&#x27;ve treated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are some characteristics that I&#x27;d like to point out specifically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BULB LIFE: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;---------------------&lt;br /&gt;The bulb that comes with this unit is rated at 5000 flashes.  Sounds like a lot, I know - but think about this.  The treatment zone per flash is a bit over 0.6 square inches.  One of your legs is probably about 600 square inches or more.  The goal is not to overlap coverage area, but that&#x27;s pretty tough to do perfectly.  So, let&#x27;s say it takes 1000 flashes per leg.  So, 2000 flashes for both legs.  That&#x27;s just your legs.  And, it&#x27;s supposed to take 10 or more treatments - that&#x27;s about 20000 flashes (or four bulbs) for your legs alone.  That&#x27;s just an example, and really just a suggestion to estimate how much surface area on your body you want to cover.  If you really just want to do a small patch, then 5000 flashes is probably sufficient for a whole treatment regimen.  At the time of this review, I don&#x27;t know how much a replacement bulb kit costs, so I don&#x27;t know the total cost of the system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUILD QUALITY: 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;---------------------------&lt;br /&gt;It is mostly plastic, at least on the outside, but the fit and finish are very good and it feels nice and solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ERGONOMICS: 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t difficult to use, but the size of the unit makes it a bit clunky to orient if you need to reach (e.g. to get part of your back).  While fairly well balanced, it is a bit top heavy and can get tiresome to hold for long periods of time.  The noise is (as they say in the instructions) like a hairdryer, but like one on low.  So, neither quiet or particularly loud.  The plug-in transformer is pretty large at 4\\&quot; tall by 2\\&quot; wide (and 2\\&quot; deep), so you&#x27;ll need some room around your plug to get this to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, watch your eyes!  The first time that I used this, I was trying to be careful about the location, and I was watching while I pulled the trigger.  Yeah, it&#x27;s bright.  Very bright.  Didn&#x27;t make me see spots, but it&#x27;ll catch your attention.  So, I closed my eyes for the next flash - and I could still see it pretty easily.  Sun glasses might be a good idea just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;---------------&lt;br /&gt;So...did it work for me?  Honestly, I have no idea, nor do I intend to use it for nine months to find out.  I&#x27;m sure that makes me sound like a quitter - but think if you&#x27;ll fall into the same boat if you buy this.  After reading all of the cautions in the manual, especially about sun exposure (which I get every day here), it makes me leery to use this.  I did try it out on my shoulder, as that is almost always covered from the sun, but I don&#x27;t have the patience it takes to use this for several months in the hopes of reducing hair by about half.  My back is the one area that I&#x27;d like to use this, but it is not easy at all to reach there with this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given all the cautions and caveats, the length of time for the treatment schedule, and the percentage of expected hair removal - I don&#x27;t recommend this unless you&#x27;re looking to treat a small area or are really, really tired of shaving/waxing.o find out.

    <li> I used the veet for about 12 bursts and it stopped. The warning light came on and I turned it off and on as directed in the instructions but the warning light is still on and the unit will not work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had professional laser hair removal done, but as far as home kits go, this one is easy to use. It does take a bit of time - you have to go spot by spot across your legs, or whatever part you&#x27;re treating, so that can take a bit. But the design of this makes it easy to see where you just were and move in a good pattern. I&#x27;ve done two treatments so far with this, and of course with the overall growth cycle of the hair follicles, it&#x27;s a long process. Though I can tell a small difference, I might not have tried it at the best time for my first treatment session. I just did the second treatment a day ago at the time of writing this, so time will tell if it really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love how easy and painless this is to use. For me, the only places it tingled or burned a little when at the highest setting was on my knees and the backs of my ankles. Everywhere else, even for someone with kind of sensitive skin, it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. You just plug it in, give it a few seconds to get started, then place the laser part on your skin, wait for the flashing indicator to come on as ready, and push the trigger. Move to the next spot, wait for the light, and pull. Repeat. It really is pretty foolproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this particular type of technology works on fair skin with dark hairs - so blonde hairs, or those with really tarn or darker skin won&#x27;t really be able to use this product. I&#x27;m pretty sure there are products out there which can accommodate those types, this simply isn&#x27;t one of them. And as with any product used on skin, those with eczema type conditions, rashes, wounds, etc, shouldn&#x27;t use this, but that&#x27;s standard fare for anything like this. But if you&#x27;re like me, and super pale with dark hair, it&#x27;s a great option. Time will tell the overall effectiveness but for now, this is off to a good start.</li>
    <li> First off the manual warns against facial use and use on skin conditions such as psoriasis.  That said the \\&quot;gun\\&quot; seems effective.  It charges up an intense burst of light which has a definite hot sensation.  Not a burn but it is one bright light for sure.  It had a safety feature which prevents using it unless its against a surface that is nice if you have kids around, probably damaging to eyes.  Results seem promising, time be tue true test but it appears to at least reduce and lighten hair.</li>
    <li> This review is going to be a work in progress given the fact that the product takes many weeks to show official results.  I will try and be thorough, yet concrete and concise.  As for my body/hair, I am Caucasian with medium toned skin and have dirty blonde to light brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Directions:  I found the directions to be very detailed and somewhat confusing - written very small and lacking in photo/picture instruction, which would have been helpful.  With all the warnings attached to the product, I was actually nervous to use the device.  That being said, I would follow the instructions thoroughly and certainly test a small area of your body before using the Veet on a larger surface area.  Also, I would test the various levels of power (1-4) and see if there are any marks, burns, etc. that are left on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Use 1:  I decided to use the Veet on my armpits and on my lower legs.  I found that using the device on my armpits was easy because of the small surface area, however using the Veet on my legs proved to be much more difficult because it was difficult to know what areas I had zapped while ensuring that I did not do the same area twice (NOT recommended).  It takes quite awhile to do larger areas of your body and I do think that because there is no real guide or stencil (lack of a better word) that overlapping is somewhat impossible to avoid.  Because of this, my first attempt left me a little red, itchy and somewhat puffy in a few spots on my legs.  These marks disappeared in a few hours.  After use 1 there was no significant changes at all in terms of hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use 2:  Now having the hang of it, the Veet was much easier to use and my ability to cover both my armpits and lower legs was done more efficiently.  Following use 2 I did notice that about a week later there were patches of hair that were missing and other hairs that seemed to fall out or come out very easily.  Also, the Veet will turn some of your moles very dark black.  I visited a dermatologist (for other reasons) and they assured me they would disappear - they did in fact go away.  As for the dermatologist, they had no worries about me using the Veet for home hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Use 3:  Again, using the Veet becomes easier and easier and I notice that I am more careful of not overlapping the same areas twice.  I no longer have itching or any type of redness after using the device.  Following use 3 I have noticed more and more patches of missing hair.  I am eager to continue using the device because I do believe it is working. The system requires patience, but I am eager to see what the results will be in the upcoming months .  . . review TBC.y dark black.

    <li> I have been using this on my arms, armpits, lower legs and bikini line.  I have darker hair with medium olive skin.  I have used it 4 times so far and am really noticing the most difference on my legs and arms - it is definitely working in patches as others have said, but it&#x27;s working.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference really until the third treatment.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a change with my armpits as far as less hair, but I do think the hair is growing back more slowly.  The important thing to note with this is that it DOES take a long time with 2-4 weeks between treatments. And each treatment takes time as well, I started by alternating areas each week to shorten the amount of time for each treatment.  I also used level 5 on all areas (go big or go home!), the bikini area is the only area where the sting was a little much, but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t handle.  The first and second treatments did leave me feeling tingly, but that went away shortly.</li>
    <li> This works. But don&#x27;t expect miracles. I have been having laser hair removal done professionally and this worked to supplement it, but only works on hair that has already been thinned by the laser therapy. I tried using this on a couple of spots that are unadulterated and there was little to no effects. The hair did come back a bit slower, but after 3 treatments there was no difference from the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if used where the hair is already thinned significantly by the laser removal, this dealt the hair it&#x27;s final blow. So, 5 stars if you have really thin hair, 3 stars if you don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I received this two days ago. I only uses 2/5 strength to hit the arm pit hairs the third time today. The hair growth have slowed down by 50%.  I planned to use it again next weekend.</li>
    <li> Not used enough yet to give full review! Shame no bag to put it in after each use!! Has to go back in the box!!!</li>
    <li> First of all, you should make sure that you can use this hair removal system before purchasing. You can not use it if you are dark skinned, your body hair is white, grey, red, or blond, you have any abnormal health conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, a history of skin cancer or potential skin malignancies, or an active implant. You also can not use it on scars, tattoos or permanent makeup areas or if you have herpes. It is not supposed to be used on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this Veet system twice now. It takes several more treatments to determine if it really works, so I will be updating my review in the future (please note that Amazon does not allow me the appropriate amount of time to do an accurate review...I have no choice but to review it now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- you have to shave before using&lt;br /&gt;- you will need someone to help you use this if you want to do it accurately&lt;br /&gt;- you have to wait 2 weeks in between treatments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this device I had my Husband watching (he was curious about the machine and how it felt and worked). It quickly became obvious that I would need his help. We did my legs, underarms and bikini area. This Hair Removal System basically works by a pulse of light. I personally felt no pain whatsoever. I feel a little flash of heat. Very rarely (maybe once per body treatment) I have also felt a slight shock. Neither the heat nor the shock were painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surface area of the light pulse is VERY small, so you will have to do a lot of pulses to complete any area. It leaves a slight indentation on your skin that is suppose to help you see where you have already pulsed. Unfortunately, the mark doesn&#x27;t stay there long enough to line it up on the sides after you finish doing a straight line up your leg. You basically have to guess where you left off. This is another reason why I recommend someone else doing it for you. They can keep track of the areas that have been done easier than you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first treatment I had no irritation and no pain. Following my second treatment two weeks later, my legs were a little sore afterwards. The next day on one spot of one leg I had a trail of pink, raised bumps. These bumps were a little painful and some of them felt like they had hairs ingrown in them. It was only one small spot of my leg, which is weird. I had no irritation elsewhere. Unfortunately, these bumps lasted 3 weeks. I am now getting ready to do my third treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did notice a decrease in hair on my lower legs after the second treatment. It does seem to be working. I am excited to see where I ended up in another 6 weeks or so. I will keep you updated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 7/10/14** I did my third treatment 7/08 in the evening. No irritation initially, but within 24 hours I had several pink bumps again. The bumps are small and itchy and almost feel like tiny bug bites (they are not since I was not outside at all). I am not sure if they are ingrown hairs or just dead hair follicles causing irritation. They are more random this time and on both legs. I am desperately trying not to itch them. My legs do feel like they are growing back less hair at this point, but I am still several treatments away from smooth legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 7/17/14** I have changed my rating to 2 stars. After my above 7/10 update the pink bumps on my skin turned red and extremely itchy. Painfully itchy. I don&#x27;t know why this is happening and why it doesn&#x27;t happen in all the areas that I do the treatment on. What I do know is that I still have hideous bumps on my legs (some are still itchy) and that I don&#x27;t know if I can experience days of itching and pain again. At this point I will not be using this system again for awhile. I may give it a shot again in the winter time when I don&#x27;t have a need to wear shorts and the memory of itchy, painful bumps is not fresh in my mind. Until then, I am done with this hair removal system. I gave it my best shot at reviewing it. I did three treatments and received a bad irritation. I may not be typical, but I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it at this point.m. I gave it my best shot at reviewing it. I did three treatments and received a bad irritation.

    <li> took me a while to adjust to shaving first and then using it. I bought it thinking it would zap the hair away and I wouldn&#x27;t have anymore work to do , but then I discovered it only works if you shave first. disappointing but it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve only gotten to use this twice, but I already have several bald patches in the areas where I&#x27;ve used it.    Overall, the pain is minimal, and even on spots where the hair has stuck around, the growth has significantly slowed. I will update after two more uses.    UPDATE:  This thing is fantastic. Granted, I have pale ghost-like skin and am zapping thick, dark hair, so I am pretty much the ideal candidate for this particular item.     As for the changes, I have been a bit slack about keeping to the suggested schedule; I cannot comfortably reach all of the areas I need to reach, so I have to vary use based on when my husband is around. Nonetheless, I have noticed three major changes:  -significantly less hair. I have several smooth bald patches  -the hair that is sticking around is much thinner, and  -it grows much more slowly     I have no doubts that had I been able to keep to the suggested time frame I would be hairless right now, though I would say that after about 4-5 uses, I have maybe 30% of the total hair that I had before starting.     Some tips for use: start off at level 2 or 3 for the first use. Then move up until you get to 5. Do this even if the pain isn&#x27;t too bad. I did this for myself and experienced zero irritation. However, when I did some hair my husband could do without, we went full blast the first time around and his skin has been extremely irritated for days now. I&#x27;m not sure that there will be scarring, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there was some mild scars...and the pain while using the light was minimal.     So for pale folks with dark hair, I would highly suggest at least trying this out if you&#x27;re considering professional hair removal. I had actually had an appointment scheduled before I ordered this and decided to give it a whirl first. And the big plus is that the cost of the system is about what a single appointment was going to cost.</li>
    <li> I want to start off by saying, I really don&#x27;t like shaving. Unfortunately, I have been &amp;#34;blessed&amp;#34; with dark wiry hair on my legs, that becomes sharp and uncomfortable when I shave. Furthermore, even when I do, I still have little dark dots under the skin, which I find very unattractive. As such, over the years, I&#x27;ve done everything I can to avoid shaving my legs - wax, threading, plucking (Ouch), home laser (Tria) and good old Nads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of doing these things, my leg hairs have kind of gotten less wiry, and some follicles I&#x27;ve actually managed to kill off. About a year ago, I decided to try the Tria generation 4 home laser product. I had some mild success with it, as it did leave me with a few bald patches, but the biggest issues I had with the Tria were: 1. the pain factor (it really hurt me) 2. the cost, and the fact that it only has a certain lifespan and then will be useless 3. the treatment window - it&#x27;s a tiny circle, so it takes a really long time to do 1 leg, and hurts. I eventually sold my Tria to a friend who was willing to take it off my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As summer approached this year, being in a small town and not having a trusted aethestician, I started looking into other hair removal devices on the market. After doing a lot of research, I decided to purchase the Veet Infini&#x27;Silk hair removal device. While still pricey, it was significantly less than Tria, has a much larger treatment window and has replaceable parts, meaning it would not be rendered useless eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my package, I was happy with the packaging, and the look and feel of the device itself. The buttons are easy to use once you figure it out. I went ahead and shaved my legs, and went at it. Initially, I used the 2 setting, no pain, went up to 4. At 4, there is a very light sensation, but it is completely tolerable in my opinion. The biggest consideration of comfort is the light. It is extremely bright and you want to make sure you are either wearing laser safe glasses, or you look away. If you accidentally look at it, you&#x27;ll be seeing tracers for a couple minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, pleased with my treatment, I put the device away and waited the prescribed 2 weeks. Although I didn&#x27;t get a photo, after the first treatment, I would say I did have about a 35% reduction in hair density. Yep, I could see some sparse patches and noticed my hair was growing back a bit slower. Awesome! This is looking promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment 2: Eager to proceed, I shaved my legs and immediately began treatment 2. This time, I cranked it up to 5, and did notice that the zap was a bit stingier, but still manageable, and the flashing light even brighter. Still, if you&#x27;ve used Tria, it&#x27;s a lot less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Weeks After Treatment 2: Woah! I definitely have more significant hair reduction. I would estimate about 75%. This time I took a photo and you can see how sparse and patchy the hair is. Some areas are devoid of hair completely, and some have stubble. It looks like places where maybe I missed a spot. Still, this is AMAZING and I am really excited about the results, coming from someone who has copious leg hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment 3: Just completed. I will be updating this review with my experience and photos as I continue the process. So far, I am very happy with my purchase, and I can say YES it works, surprisingly well, and I would recommend this to anyone with hair removal needs. Love!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 Weeks After Treatment 3: This little device is proving to be a miracle worker. My leg hair is most definitely stunted at this point. I would say now I&#x27;m at about 85% reduction, and what hair there is falls into a couple categories: stubble/straggler hairs and little tiny black spots. The craziest thing is some of these tiny black dots fall out if I just run a nail over them, and some of them came off after exfoliating my legs. It would appear these little baby growths have been weakened and just comeoff. Still loving the results! Stay tuned for treatment 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment 4: I was reflecting on the first time I shaved prior to using the device the first time - it took at least 10 minutes to do both legs. Now, shaving for treatment 4, it took about 2 minutes tops. The majority of my leg hair is just gone and I am thrilled. Treatment 4 went by quickly, and I am looking forward to updating this review in a couple weeks with the outcome.off. Still loving the results!

    <li> If you&#x27;ve already been through a few rounds of laser hair removal, this system will seem pretty familiar to you.  After going through laser treatment myself and being pleased (but not $1,000 pleased) with the results, I wanted to test out a home laser system.  (Quick PSA: If you can afford it, I would suggest you go down to a reputable laser clinic and discuss your skin type with them.  Being very fair skinned with black hair, I assumed I was the ideal candidate, but during my initial consultation my ethnic background played a factor in a way I would not have anticipated and the laser specialist opted to use different levels based on that information - I have friends who have been turned away from clinics because of similar reasons, so before you even try to do something like this on your own, consult a specialist or be prepared to deal with the consequences on your own.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little while to go through everything and read all the instructions, so plan ahead - that first time is not a zap-and-go ordeal, but once you get the hang of it, it will be.  Also, just like a regular laser session, you have to shave right before your treatment for the best results.  The pain level is about the same and the popping sound is no louder than the sound from a professional machine.  There was a little bit of a whirring noise, but that&#x27;s supposed to be normal.  So far, things are not quite as impressive as the office laser treatment, but definitely better than I expected from Veet and I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m really pleased with the progress.  They do recommend significantly more treatments than the professional laser treatments, so I&#x27;ll update once a full treatment round is complete to see what the final results are like!</li>
    <li> So, this is the first time I’ve ever reviewed an item anywhere before, so that right there is saying something. I would normally never buy something so expensive for myself, so when I received this for Christmas, I was beyond excited.  I quickly opened the box and read through the instructions.  This is not a device for everyone and a before you begin, you have to find out if you’re a ‘candidate’.  I recommend doing your research first before even buying this.  Why waste the time and money if it won’t work on you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Unfortunately, if you are dark-skinned, heavily tanned or have light hair, this isn’t for you.  If you do fall into this category, not only may the Veet Infini Silk Pro not work on you, but it is warned that the product could cause burns, blisters or scarring.  Basically, the IPL (Intense pulse light) is attracted to dark pigments, such as your hair.  This concentrated light is absorbed by the dark areas causing the product to do its magic.  If you have dark skin, it isn’t just the hair follicle absorbing this light, but all of the treatment area.  Obviously, this is bad.  Thankfully, Veet has programed the Infini Pro to lock out if the area detected is too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Before beginning, the skin must be freshly shaved- waxing won’t work.  Straight from the shower, I unboxed the Veet Infini Silk Pro and was off.  The product is a little bulky in my hand, but not so much to deter me from using it.  There are 5 different levels to choose from, so I decided to start with level 2.  I pressed the Veet Infini Silk Pro to my leg, then prepared myself for the pain.  There was a “popping” sound and a blinding light, and nothing.  No pain or redness!  It took about 45 minutes to do both legs, from ankle to thigh.  After my legs, I decided to attempt my underarms and bikini line.  Still no pain, but I definitely felt some warmth after each “pop”.  With my 1st session under my belt, I had only one complaint.  Trying to get aclean bikini line is a bit difficult since you really can’t see where to place the device.  It isn’t much of a problem for my legs or underarms since I want all the hair in those areas  to be gone, but it’s more problematic when you want precision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have absolutely no patience and waited only a week before my next treatment.  I saw no change at all after the first and decided to crank it up to full blast.  Level 5 on my legs was a walk in the park.  I felt a nanosecond of heat each time, but nothing that fazed me.  Level 5 under my arms did cause me to jump at first.  This was most likely because I wasn’t prepared.  Maybe 2 spots under each arm felt like a rubber band snap.  Not pleasant, but if it means less shaving, I can do it!  Bikini area was a different story.  Most of the area was fine, but there were a few spots where it felt like I was being stung by hornets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I’ve done one treatment a week (this is way more than suggested) since Christmas, and the results are amazing!  There’s an 80% reduction of hair under my arms, about a 70% reduction to bikini line, and 50% to my legs.  After only a month, I couldn’t ask for a better product!  I will continue to update!</li>
    <li> The Veet System does work - it just takes patience.  If you make the decision to invest in it, you need to be persistent with using it.  A systematic approach is best because it does take time. Always have a spare bulb on hand as it is difficult to track when a new one is needed and you will know because the light won&#x27;t turn green as quickly...</li>
    <li> On the veet website, the pro is going for 299 and that includes a free cartridge.</li>
    <li> I have been using this once a week for almost 3 months now. I know the instructions say to use this every other week, but I have had no skin irritation using it once a week. Do this at your own risk, of course. I&#x27;ve used this on my underarms, legs, and bikini line. I have light skin and black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the highest level treatment everywhere, and in terms of pain, it was very bearable. As everyone will tell you, there&#x27;s a slight snapping/burning sensation in some areas on the highest setting, but it&#x27;s over in a split second. I am used to waxing though, so my pain tolerance is probably already built up a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of results...I have had varied results in the areas I&#x27;ve been treating. For me, this worked the best on my underarms. I noticed about a 50% reduction after the first 3-4 treatments, and the amount of hair that grows back has been steadily declining with each subsequent treatment. I&#x27;m at the point now where I shave my underarms only once a week (right before I use the laser), and see only very slow growth in small patches in between. I would say the hair there is at about 90% reduction now, and with the slowed growth of the remaining hair, it looks like I&#x27;ve only gone two days between shaving rather than a week. Pain in this area is minimal. I get a bit of a sting every once in a while, but not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treatment on the bikini line has been slower. I noticed no difference until about a 6-7 treatments in, and at that point it was slightly slowed growth overall and some small patches not growing back in. Probably about 15% reduction. Subsequent treatments have been slowly stopping more of the hair though. Right now I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m at 35% reduction overall. The pain in this area is a bit more noticeable, but still very bearable. The pain varies with the area as you get further in, much like a bikini wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs have seen no improvement at all. However, the hair on my legs is very very thin, and I gave up treating the area after the 8th round. This may work better if you have coarser hair on your legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cartridge that came with this is still going strong, and I plan to continue treating the underams and bikini line. Each treatment takes me roughly 20 minutes to do now (not including legs), and is not unpleasant if I put on an episode of whatever TV show I&#x27;m watching while I do it. The fan for this thing is a bit loud. Think roughly half the volume of a hair dryer. Not a big deal though. The flashes are also very bright. I do not wear eye protection while using this, but I turn my head away when the flash goes off.</li>
    <li> I purchased my Infini&#x27;Silk in January 2015 and I have used it around 7 times. I have treated my face, neck, legs, arms, armpits, stomach...pretty much everywhere! I normally have to shave my legs everyday, but I can now go at least a week without needing to shave. My legs aren&#x27;t smooth like they are when I shave them, but the hair isn&#x27;t visible for a few days. I have gone through 2 cartridges which is why I am on Amazon today so I can purchase another. The first replacement cartridge was around $40, but now I see 1 cartridge is nearly $80. Not real happy about that considering I either buy one or stop my treatments half way through.</li>
    <li> I love it but it was supose to have an extra bulb and mine didn&#x27;t have one.</li>
    <li> OKay, here&#x27;s the scoop. This thing does work and it works well BUT it takes a lot of applications and still don&#x27;t expect to be completely hair free. It&#x27;s really diminished the hairs on my legs(I barely shave now) but I do still have to shave. What I was most impressed with was my bikini area(and a bit further in). It worked really well there though the amount of times I had to zap it is over ten and still counting. Most of the side area is pretty smooth, it&#x27;s just further in that&#x27;s giving me a headache. The real problem is getting a close shave before using the device, which is crucial to success. Fair warning, I felt barely anything even on the highest levels when I used it on my legs but when I used it on my bikini area it did sting a little... nothing like a bikini wax, just a little zap and completely worth it in my opinion. Again, I add that I&#x27;m still working towards that smooth goal but I have confidence I will get close if not there entirely.</li>
    <li> Item as described. Good experience</li>
    <li> PLEASE READ UPDATES BELOW BEFORE BUYING THIS DEVICE. My rating was originally four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review begins here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am at Day 30 of owning and using the Veet Infini Silk Pro Light-based IPL Hair Removal System for home use. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with the results but I should mention in all honesty I&#x27;m not very hairy, just normal, I guess. But I really (REALLY) hate shaving my legs (lazy) so this device has been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me talk first about the device itself. Ergonomically, the gun feels comfortable in the hand - neither too heavy nor too light so if, like me, you will spend some time on the legs, you won&#x27;t feel hand fatigue. The body of the gun feels sturdy enough in case of an accidental drop but I&#x27;m doing my best to be careful. The unit itself comes with travel adapters and a power cord and the light cartridge comes pre-installed. I&#x27;m going to talk a bit about the cartridge and the power cord - the two things that make this unit stand out and surpass the Tria devices by a long shot. One reason I opted not to purchase a Tria device was the lack of power options. In order to use the Tria, you have to charge and keep recharging the device and you only get about 15 minutes of use with each charge. With the Veet, you plug it in and use it for as long as you need to (in my case, about a half hour to do two legs) but you could laser for as long as you&#x27;d like and not have the frustration of having to stop every 15 minutes. This is a MAJOR plus. The laser cartridges, however, are the main reason one should consider the Veet over the Tria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the laser output covers a much bigger (rectangular) area than the Tria (small round window) and has a bit of a grid thing going on so that it&#x27;s easier to follow a pattern (grid) when working on an area like the lower leg. Goes much faster this way. The other excellent feature is the ability to replace the cartridges when you run out. In fact, the device itself alerts you to when you have about 100 pulses left so you can order the replacement cartridges. On the Tria, when the laser is done, it&#x27;s done - time for a new device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the actual use of the device. I read the instructions very carefully before beginning - please don&#x27;t skip this step. This is a laser and if used improperly can cause burns, especially if used on the wrong skin/hair type (should only be used on fair skin/dark hair combination) since the laser is looking for the dark hair at the skin level. That&#x27;s why you need to shave before you start lasering. If you don&#x27;t shave, all you&#x27;ll get is burnt hair.  There&#x27;s a skin sensor on the device that won&#x27;t allow it to pulse if not on the right skin type. Device pulses about every 3 seconds or so for safety reasons (you really don&#x27;t want to pulse the same spot multiple times accidentally so this is an important feature).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Device has five power levels and you should start with the first level and keep going up a level at a time until you can no longer tolerate a higher level. I am comfortably at a level four doing my legs with just a quick snap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for whether or not the technology itself works, my experience so far has been good. The first time I used it, I shaved both legs but only treated one. I wanted to compare the results and yes, even after only one use, there was a noticeable decrease in regrowth as compared with the non-treated leg. So far I&#x27;ve done about three treatments on the one leg and two on the other and I&#x27;m very happy with the progress. VERY. I can&#x27;t wait to start the bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where I am right now. I will make dated updates to this review as I continue to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this five stars but I took a star off since I can&#x27;t seem to find replacement cartridges to purchase for this or how much they will cost. That said, I will add the star back if I can find the information on replacement cartridges via the toll-free number provided in the instruction booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I can recommend without reservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for updates!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/8/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: I called the toll-free number provided in the instruction booklet to inquire about replacement cartridges. I&#x27;m not exactly sure if the number is for Veet or Reckitt Benckiser, the parent company. In any case, the representative I spoke with had no information and referred me to another number which turned out to be Guthy-Renker, the folks who distribute Proactiv and Wen. I got an operator named Stephanie who was a bit unfriendly (not exactly rude but definitely unfriendly) who told me they had a \\&quot;few\\&quot; replacement cartridges in stock. There is apparently an infomercial about this product, which I didn&#x27;t know about. She told me that I should call another number and then gave me the original number I had called (the number in the instruction manual). When I told her that was the number that I had originally called and that they referred me to the Guthy-Renker number, she then offered me replacement cartridges at $49 per cartridge, 5,000 light pulses per cartridge, free shipping and handling, delivered in 7-10 business days. I purchased two ($98) because of the apparent difficulty in acquiring replacements. I think the price of the cartridge is very reasonable considering how much professional laser treatment costs. But it would be nice if Amazon offered the replacement cartridges too. Or if there were a simple way to purchase through Veet. For anyone interested, the Guthy-Renker number is 888 904 8080.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 7/29/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So several weeks later and my cartridges still havn&#x27;t arrived. On 7/25/14, I called the 888 number and spoke with Sharon, a different representative, who could not find my original order even though I had a confirmation number. In fact, I hadn&#x27;t even been added to the system, which ticked me off a bit, frankly. Anyway, Sharon was very nice, apologized profusely, and offered me free expedited shipping. She said items would go out on 7/26/14 and arrive via 2-day UPS expedited shipping on Tuesday 7/29/14 (today). After waiting all day for the UPS man and not receiving anything, I called the 888 number again to inquire about the tracking info. This time I spoke with Kathy. Kathy tells me that although Sharon did, in fact, authorize expedited shipping, the cartridges are still in the warehouse getting packed. THEY HAVEN&#x27;T EVEN LEFT THE WAREHOUSE! Normally, the cartridges take 7-10 days to arrive. I re-placed the order on 7/25/14. If these actually leave the warehouse tomorrow, I will likely receive them on 8/1/14, which is the standard 7 days! So Sharon either forgot to request expedited shipping and Kathy was covering for the mistake, or she basically lied and never put it through. It&#x27;s exhausting. The Tria is looking better and better! You can actually go to Sephora for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on, an update about the results. So about another 30 days have gone by and I am still very pleased with the product (it would be a shame if I had to trade it in for a Tria because I can&#x27;t get replacement cartridges). My legs are looking very good with about 4 treatments and I&#x27;ve started on the bikini line. The funny thing about the legs is that I can actually see the spots I&#x27;ve missed with the laser by small patches of stubble so I know it&#x27;s really working. Bikini line is actually going extremely well. Although I will say it hurts more near the crease of the leg and I definitely had to go down a level because the laser feels hotter on that area. After a couple of zaps on 5 (what I have been using on the lower leg, which didn&#x27;t hurt at all), I almost felt like it was burning me. Even so, I&#x27;ve yet to get any redness or irritation on any of treated skin, even when it felt like it was burning on the bikini line. But even after only one treatment, I had a very noticeable difference and the skin is smooth, not even a stubble. I&#x27;ve done two treatments each side of the bikini line and am now waiting for some regrowth to zap. I understand it will take about 18 months to completely remove everything (or mostly everything) (hence the replacement cartridges), and I am excited that this really works and I will (hopefully) never have to shave my legs again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/2/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges still haven&#x27;t arrived. Called the 888 number AGAIN. This time spoke with Sharon 2 (different Sharon than previous Sharon). I&#x27;m informed by Sharon 2 that the cartridges still haven&#x27;t left the warehouse. Sharon read the record and called in a supervisor because the order was not placed correctly by either original Sharon or Kathy (there&#x27;s so much doubletalk going on, it&#x27;s hard to keep track of the excuses). Anyway, now that the order is allegedly correct, it will go out via expedited overnight shipping. But here&#x27;s the kicker: it takes three days processing time to ship overnight/expedited. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it anymore, which is sad because it&#x27;s a great product. But what&#x27;s the point if you can&#x27;t go buy replacement cartridges somewhere like Amazon, or CVS, or Ulta? And more importantly, directly from the manufacturer? I am changing my recommendation to reflect this major, MAJOR issue. Honestly, just buy the Tria. It will take longer because of the smaller laser head and the recharging but at least when it&#x27;s out of pulses, you can go back to Sephora and replace it simply and easily. No hassles. The device and results are great but I want to be honest. This is something potential buyers should be aware of BEFORE buying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/6/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally received the package by UPS but upon opening, there was only one cartridge, not two. There was also a packing slip saying I was charged for two ($98). So I called the 888 number AGAIN to ask why. I got Sharon - not sure if it was Sharon 1 or Sharon 2 or possibly a Sharon 3. Anyway, Sharon couldn&#x27;t figure out why I hadn&#x27;t received two when their records showed that two were sent. She insisted two were sent so when I finally offered to email a photo of the packaging and packing slip exactly as they were sent to me so they could see that only one small cartridge could fit inside the box, she relented and offered to send me a \\&quot;free replacement.\\&quot; But she couldn&#x27;t ship it out immediately because it was \\&quot;free\\&quot; even though I had paid $49 for it! UGH! So I asked for a supervisor and got connected to Kathy, who was the first person at the company to seem interested in what had happened. Her apologies were not perfunctory and did not sound scripted like the representatives I spoke with. She said she&#x27;d make sure another cartridge would go out and that I&#x27;d receive it in about four days. She also made a credit to my account but I have yet to see this show up on my account. She also said she&#x27;d have someone follow up with me in a few days so we&#x27;ll see how this turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for some additional good and bad news. The GOOD news is that Amazon now sells the cartridges for purchase online and I&#x27;m sure there won&#x27;t be any problems with shipping through them. The BAD news is the cartridges are $69 each as opposed to the $49 by Guthy Renker. That&#x27;s a big difference. When/if I ever receive the second cartridge, I&#x27;m hoping that the two will be enough to finish my legs and bikini line before they run out of pulses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have such mixed feelings about this device. I really think the device is amazing and it works. It really works. But I just don&#x27;t think the company is user friendly for customers and that&#x27;s half the value of any product. We&#x27;re back to three stars at this point which leaves me neutral for the moment until I see how things progress with the replacement cartridge, the credit, and follow up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay tuned for more updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: November 26, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I feel obligated to make at this one final update. So the legs are pretty smooth now, minus a few spots Ihave missed here and there by not following the grid lines. The bikini area goes so quickly - a few treatments and some spot maintenance seems to be all that was needed and is working quite well. I&#x27;m very happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the customer service portion of the program, I was waiting for a follow-up call from Guthy Renker. Guess what? It NEVER CAME! Surprise surprise. The \\&quot;free\\&quot; replacement cartridge showed up about a month later and the refund was almost two months to get but at least it showed up. Eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to deal with Amazon only and not the company, despite the price differences (which may end up leveling out at some point). At least with Amazon, the customer service is beyond reproach. They really make the customer experience a priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it!

    <li> This is surprisingly easy to use and effective.  I did laser hair removal at my doctor&#x27;s office many years ago until I realized it was just too expensive.  I loved having it done because, although it doesn&#x27;t remove all hair permanently, it keeps most of it away for a much, much longer time than shaving or waxing or electrolysis (all which I have tried).  It is also much less painful than electrolysis (although in some areas it is still pretty painful).  This device works pretty much like I remember from my professional treatments.  You press it into your skin and it leaves an indentation so you can keep track of where you&#x27;ve already removed hair.  It does take a few seconds to &amp;#34;recharge&amp;#34; each time, which can make it feel like a slow process.  I like that it has adjustable levels so I can start light and gradually increase the level until I&#x27;m Ok with the amount of discomfort.  If you have light skin and dark hair (which I do) this is the best hair removal method around - and now that it is available for home use, it&#x27;s actually affordable.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to use this, and then I read the fine print on the box.  Not for pregnant or nursing ladies!  I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant so I will have to wait.  Just wanted to pass this on to any other pregnant ladies considering buying this!  I like the looks of the gun, the large surface area that goes against your skin, and the fact that the bulb can be replaced if needed.  I will update when I am able to use this.  In the meantime, I hope this information helps!</li>
    <li> I found the instruction for this product very easy to follow and very easy to use.  First you shave the area you would like to treat and then you start using the Veet Infini Silk hair removal system.  The system has five settings, the instructions suggest you start at the first setting and go as high as you can tolerate.  I was able to tolerate five, without any discomfort on my legs and I felt a little warmth under my arms.  The treatment schedule is 1 through 4 every two weeks then 5 through 7 four weeks apart then 8 plus treatments as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have done the first two treatments with no side effects. I have been shaving and the hair has continued to grow back in as normal but I&#x27;m only done two treatments, so you can&#x27;t except any results yet. I&#x27;m very excited to complete my 8 treatments and hope to have hair reduction as promised.  The only negative is the light that comes from the lazer bothers my eyes somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy with this product as I&#x27;ve had no pain and the devise is easy to use and I look forward to great results.  I am giving four stars and hope to raise it to five stars when I see results.  I will be updating my progress and let you know my final results.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t accurately rate the Veet Infini-Silk (oy) Pro Light-Based Ipl Hair Removal System for Home Use (whew!) because I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to do so. Based on my (so far) limited experience, I&#x27;ll do my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a natural blonde with fair skin and body hair. The first quality is a plus for the Veet Infini-Silk, the second not so much. Light-based systems such as this one seek melanin in the hair targeted for removal and if there isn&#x27;t much to be found, zapping isn&#x27;t as effective as one would wish. It would seem that the ideal candidate for light-based epilation is someone with fair skin and dark hair because light-based systems are definitely NOT recommended for those with dark skin (even if that color is due to a tan; nix to hair growing from moles, too). So be aware of the rather narrow parameters that qualify a prospective user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As instructed, I&#x27;ve been shaving the areas I want to target prior to use. So far--given that the treatments are monthly--I&#x27;m not seeing much of anything different on my arms and legs but if I&#x27;m not mistaken, I just might be seeing less growth under my arms; that hair is somewhat heavier and a bit darker as well. However, at this stage of the game, it&#x27;s hard to tell, especially since I&#x27;m not all that hirsute (however, a gal can&#x27;t have too little body hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Veet Infini-Silk is very easy to use and I haven&#x27;t found it to be painful. I&#x27;ll update as time goes on but the best I can do at this time is to rate it a \\&quot;so far, so good . . . I think.\\&quot; I&#x27;m hopeful, though, that I&#x27;ll see some results.</li>
    <li> Half-italian.  Hair everywhere.....that is until I started using this!!  Worth the money.  I used to have to shave at least once a day.  Now maybe once a week after the 1st FOUR treatments.  Never thought it would be possible.  Love it.  Get it.  Spend less time in shower shaving.</li>
    <li> So far so good! I have been using this product for about three weeks. I probably use it more often than the directions say because I&#x27;m impatient. I have been using it on my face, underarms, bikini area, legs and even toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been treating one leg and not the other so I can see the difference. I can already tell that the hair on my treated leg is much more sparce and takes longer to grow back than the untreated leg.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have light skin and dark hair. I have also been able to use the machine on full power. Sometimes I feel hear and the most pain I ever feel is like an elastic band snapping on my skin. I have fairly sensitive skin which is why I want permanent hair removal. I have, so far, not had any problems with irritation. Sometimes my skin feels a little dry after treament and is easily soothed. So far, I am quite pleased with my results.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I have been using this every other week for right at two months, I&#x27;ve noticed less and slowed hair growth and some bald patches!&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy it is working. Well worth the money. I am using it on my under arms and bikini line first and will probably start my legs soon. It doesn&#x27;t take long at all, about 10-15 minutes for bikini and arm pits! And to me, it doesn&#x27;t hurt !!! Way less painful than waxing or the tria laser. I have even seen quicker results than I did with my tria, which I quit. The people who say level 5 is painful and they need ice have super sensitive skin! The light is very bright when u push the button, so I just close my eyes.&lt;br /&gt; It works and is not painful to me, slight tingle..not even painful like a rubber band slap.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely give this a try!</li>
    <li> This product did work. The pain/effectiveness was easily manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I returned it because Groupon has better deals in my area.</li>
    <li> Personally I find it is much better than the smaller version. IPL covers bigger area, and is more effective. Although Veet claims that the IPL is the same for both model, I find Pro is stronger than the smaller one,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this machine for about 6 weeks and I&#x27;ve used it 3 or 4 times. I am not expecting immediate results, but the density reduction I have seen in such a sort time is promising. It suggests using it for 18-24 months for full results. I have only used it on my underarms and even on the highest setting the sensation it is bearable. The replacement cartridges are reasonably priced for how long each lasts. I will update this review as time goes on.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing.  I would recommend this Veet hair removal system to anyone.  I have olive skin, &amp; dark hair, with some baby lighter hair mixed in, and it took care of it all...the coarse hair and the soft hair.  This system has done a GREAT job.  Not being self conscious of unwanted hair on my upper lip, chin, arm pits, and bikini line has been an amazing blessing.  I am going to start on my legs next.  I am so so happy with this purchase.  It is ABSOLUTELY painless to me, and I use it on the highest setting.  (My skin is NOT sensitive at all though.)  THIS WORKS!!  It is time consuming, but worth it when you realize you never have to worry about unwanted hair again.  I am always beach/pool ready!  I have also had professional laser hair removal in the past, and this is equal in quality.  It does take multiple treatments over a period of time, but I saw a dramatic reduction every time I used it.  Also, you have to shave before you use it, and I have noticed that it works best for me when I shave and then wait 1 or 2 days before I use the Veet.</li>
    <li> Is was horrible. I did not like that it fails so easily. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Works great! This thing is awesome. Greatly reduced hairs on neck that would always in-grow, so I tried on other areas that did the same, then tried on chest and back since it&#x27;s a carpet and always use hair cutting sheers to keep it tamed, but couldn&#x27;t shave due to the same ingrowing problem. After two treatments on chest the majority of hair is gone, I&#x27;m shocked. Keep in mind it is still there, just very very sparse and thin. Think that will probably go away after a few more treatments.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, it is not stated, but the Silk&#x27;n cartridges DO WORK in this thing too! So no need to purchase for high price through Veet. Get the Silk&#x27;n 3pk on Amazon for $66 ;)</li>
    <li> First I want to explain my skin and hair type since this device should only be used on a certain combination of skin and hair color.    I&#x27;m part Scottish. No, I didn&#x27;t get the beautiful red hair that comes with that heritage. I got the pastey white skin. And no, not Nicole Kidman skin. I have freckles. And, again, no, not the cute summer only freckles that appear on just the nose and the cheeks. I mean, I have freckles. Like the ones you wish would grow together so that you&#x27;d appear to have a tan. As for my hair, it&#x27;s dark. Not just dark, but super dark. And thick. I&#x27;m talking body hair here people, not what&#x27;s on my head. Naturally, the hair on my head is thin. Quite opposite of what I&#x27;d prefer. So, other than the freckles, I&#x27;d be an ideal candidate for this machine.    January 10th, 2015, was my first treatment.  I want to point out that if you have kids, this is an excellent excuse to have some \\&quot;mommy time\\&quot; and have one&#x27;s partner watch the children. So, I showered and shaved just like it states in the instructions. Make sure you don&#x27;t put that lotion on your legs when you get out of the shower. After walking around my bedroom naked trying to air dry my legs, I didn&#x27;t want them damp, I re-read the instruction manual to make sure I would do this correctly. It&#x27;s actually super easy to do. And super easy to mess up. The biggest issue is trying not to overlap. However, the booklet says top do rows. The best way to do this is to start at the ankle and work around your leg. Totally opposite of one&#x27;s inclination. I&#x27;m so used to shaving that I wanted to treat the device like a razor and go up my leg. So, if you work around your leg, the indention that the device leaves shows long enough so you won&#x27;t overlap.    To the pain: How does it feel? For starters, let me just say that I am a wuss. I hate needles, shots, blood draws, etc. When I need blood drawn 50% of the time I ask for a butterfly needle. That&#x27;s the small needle they use on freakin&#x27; babies. So yeah. I&#x27;m a major wuss. Levels 1-3 felt like nothing. I was sure I was doing it wrong or that the device wasn&#x27;t working even though I was seeing flashes of light. Level 4 I only felt a slight warmth. And that could have been my imagination, or it could be because my bathroom was cold and the device was just giving off radiant heat from the other pulses.  Level 5 didn&#x27;t feel like much of anything going up the leg. I didn&#x27;t really notice it until around my knee. And even then, it barely felt like anything. Now, the arm pits are a different story. I figured since I was so brave doing level 5 on my legs, what&#x27;s the harm in trying it out on level 5 in the pit area. MISTAKE! Gradually try out the levels in each area. Level 5 wasn&#x27;t bad until I got into the arm pit crease and up the arm. HOLY MOLEY! Level 4 for the pits for me. I also did my feet. Yes, I&#x27;m not ashamed to say that I have hair on 2 toes on each foot and some on the top of my foot. At least I do for now. Muhahahaha! I will get you toe hairs. It was weird shaving my feet so I could use this device.    Smell: There&#x27;s no real smell. After about 3 different pulses I smelled burning hair. Chances are I sucked at shaving. More than likely it&#x27;s the one or two area we all miss when shaving in a hurry. So, the hair outside of my skin got burnt and the hair follicle is probably still growing hair. Sigh. I&#x27;ll get you next time!    Since this was my first treatment, I can&#x27;t tell you about how effective this is. What I will do is keep updating my review as my hair growth slows, increases or ends. See you in two weeks.    January 25th, 2015:    Just did my 2nd treatment yesterday. I have not seen a difference in amount of hair. However, I have seen a difference in rate of hair growth. I didn&#x27;t shave in between treatments (until treatment day) and my hair wasn&#x27;t long enough to braid for a change. That&#x27;s a win for me. Fingers crossed for more improvements to report in two weeks.    February 8th, 2015:    Finished up my 3rd treatment yesterday.I&#x27;m kind of digging this thing. Before I shaved my legs for the treatment, I noticed that I had some bald spots. Not very large, like the size of a nickel, but they were there. And there was about 5 of those patches on each leg. SCORE! So, this thing is working, it&#x27;s just time consuming. Now only if it could zap my varicose veins too.</li>
