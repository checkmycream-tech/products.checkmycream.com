      <li>for what it is, it&#x27;s good, but the quality could be better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the most savvy with a lipstick tube (I prefer the brushes), so take my application critique with a grain of salt.</li>

      <li>Love the color</li>
      <li>Its a nice smooth lipstick.</li>
      <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>If you haven&#x27;t purchased lip-liner (NYX&#x27;s &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34; goes perfectly with it), then don&#x27;t bother trying to wear this in public.</li>
      <li>Beautiful dark colour and amazing staying power though!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rich deep but bright color that would look great with many skin tones.</li>
      <li>This has got to be the most beautiful shade of red</li>
      <li>Beautiful blue-based red lipstick.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for a good red lipstick for years, and while I&#x27;ve found a few I liked, this one is the best shade I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
      <li>Goes on creamy and smooth.</li>
      <li>This shade of red was perfect for my skin tone and it stayed on very well.</li>
      <li>lol..had to look at the name again to be sure i ordered the right thing.</li>
      <li>it is a very nice rich red.</li>
      <li>Got here just in time for my special event.</li>
      <li>The application, in general, is very smooth, and it has a lovely matte finish.</li>
      <li>It is now one of my absolute favorite reds of all time.</li>
      <li>I 100 % reccomend this, its smooth,long lasting and has a great vibrant color !</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the buy if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;creature of the night&amp;#34; like myself who&#x27;s been looking for a good red lipstick.</li>
      <li>Very pretty color...</li>
      <li>The colour was a rich red shade that would be suitable on any skin-type.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous shade of red and does not wear off fast.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick, the color is vibrant and very pigmented.</li>
      <li>This is a deep cherry red and looks beautiful on me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super pigmented and stayed put all night through a concert only touching up once...which I probably could&#x27;ve gone without.</li>
      <li>I love this red.</li>
      <li>Plus it faded to a pretty lip stain.</li>
      <li>SO PRETTY.</li>
      <li>If you put it on bare lips, or put on more than one coat (this is such a rich color you don&#x27;t need more than one anyway), the lipstick will bleed a little.  </li>
      <li>plus the shipping is fast</li>
      <li>I have light brown/olive skin, and find that most red lipsticks are too pink, too orange, or too brown.  </li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
      <li>I expected this since it&#x27;s so cheap.  </li>
      <li>It long lasting and the color suits most skin tones.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a vampy red, not a pure bright red.</li>
      <li>although it is so pigmented that your lips will stay red all day, you&#x27;ll have to do maintenance on it several times), and it tends to slide around on your lips when first applied, so make sure to use a lip liner, blot, and set the lipstick with a loose powder.  </li>
      <li>: it doesn&#x27;t keep that freshly applied look for long (</li>
      <li>it was the exact red I&#x27;ve been searching for, for quite some time now.</li>
      <li>It too me so long to find the right one, &amp; this is it.</li>
      <li>The lipstick is so smooth and long lasting.</li>
      <li>My attempts only succeeded in making me look like I had been drinking too much cherry</li>
      <li>Would have been five stars if it was a real vampy blood red on me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent red lipstick that would give me the &amp;#34;sexy vampire&amp;#34; look rather than the &amp;#34;creepy clown&amp;#34; one.</li>
      <li>But its pretty dark.</li>
      <li>As far as color goes, this one definitely fits the bill.</li>
      <li>It has a creamy texture and did not dry out my lips.</li>
      <li>This product is creamy and doesn&#x27;t really dry out my lips too much, though it does dry out some.</li>

    <li> Very pretty color...it was the exact red I&#x27;ve been searching for, for quite some time now. It stains REALLY badly...which is why I took off a star. It&#x27;s not a good choice for people (like me) that make a lot of mistakes when applying lipstick. However, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful blue-based red lipstick. Goes on creamy and smooth. Lacks some staying power but leaves enough stain to keep from having to reapply constantly. Best to use a lip brush as it stains when you make mistakes.</li>
    <li> The only reason I docked a star was because it really stains and if you mess up, it&#x27;s not pretty. Make sure to have makeup remover wipes! Beautiful dark colour and amazing staying power though!</li>
    <li> This is must have color for everyone. It is now one of my absolute favorite reds of all time. It&#x27;s super pigmented and stayed put all night through a concert only touching up once...which I probably could&#x27;ve gone without. I love this red. SO PRETTY.</li>
    <li> purchased this product because of the reviews i saw on youtube. lol..had to look at the name again to be sure i ordered the right thing. Its not the color i was expecting, nut i can manage.</li>
    <li> Love the color it is a very nice rich red. It long lasting and the color suits most skin tones. I&#x27;m tan and its wonderful!</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick, the color is vibrant and very pigmented. Is also moisturizing and long lasting! What else can you ask for, and for an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> The colour was a rich red shade that would be suitable on any skin-type. It has a creamy texture and did not dry out my lips. It&#x27;s a fantastic lipstick for a great price.</li>
    <li> Superb quality! Very pigmented and you can get awesome color in just one swipe!&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for a long time and it&#x27;s creamy and feels moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any weird smell like some of the other round lipsticks do .</li>
    <li> This is truly a snow white red. If you apply too much, it does tend to look a bit too dark and vampy but a slight touch on the lips and you&#x27;re ready to go. It does look blood colored, lol, which I love.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very, very pale young lady. I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent red lipstick that would give me the &amp;#34;sexy vampire&amp;#34; look rather than the &amp;#34;creepy clown&amp;#34; one. As far as color goes, this one definitely fits the bill. This has got to be the most beautiful shade of red I&#x27;ve ever seen for a lipstick, and it compliments my milky skin perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it does have it&#x27;s cons. I&#x27;m not the most savvy with a lipstick tube (I prefer the brushes), so take my application critique with a grain of salt. The application, in general, is very smooth, and it has a lovely matte finish. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of bleeding... a lot. If you haven&#x27;t purchased lip-liner (NYX&#x27;s &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34; goes perfectly with it), then don&#x27;t bother trying to wear this in public. My attempts only succeeded in making me look like I had been drinking too much cherry Kool-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other issue is that it doesn&#x27;t have the strongest lasting power. But this is coming from someone who&#x27;s been using Revlon&#x27;s &amp;#34;Overtime&amp;#34; line up until now -- so maybe I&#x27;m just spoiled. *Don&#x27;t* touch your lips or it will smudge off. Also, I wouldn&#x27;t wear this if you&#x27;re planning to go out to dinner; it&#x27;s not going to stay on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, though, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth the buy if you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;creature of the night&amp;#34; like myself who&#x27;s been looking for a good red lipstick.</li>
    <li> This is a fab lipstick and I&#x27;ve taken to wearing it whenever I need a pick me up. It&#x27;s a rich deep but bright color that would look great with many skin tones. And the price is fab.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. It&#x27;s an amazing color. Got here just in time for my special event. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This shade of red was perfect for my skin tone and it stayed on very well. Plus it faded to a pretty lip stain.</li>
    <li> I am VERY satisfied with this lipstick! It&#x27;s a gorgeous shade of red and does not wear off fast. I recommend it and would purchase it all over again!</li>
    <li> i was looking for a red lipstick that was a blood red color. It too me so long to find the right one, &amp; this is it. The lipstick is so smooth and long lasting. This product even arrived earlier than i thought. I 100 % reccomend this, its smooth,long lasting and has a great vibrant color ! plus the shipping is fast</li>
    <li> but it is a bit darker that it is shown on the photo. i do love it the name color goes really good bc i do feel like snow white wearing it.</li>
    <li> Its a nice smooth lipstick. No complaints. Thought it would be darker. But its pretty dark. Would have been five stars if it was a real vampy blood red on me.</li>
    <li> Like the title states, this is darker than I expected. It&#x27;s a vampy red, not a pure bright red. This product is creamy and doesn&#x27;t really dry out my lips too much, though it does dry out some. Overall this is a great product. I don&#x27;t need to repurchase because this has lasted me a while since I don&#x27;t use it often. Though, I probably wouldn&#x27;t repurchase even if I run out because I prefer a brighter happier red than this dark vampy red. Nothing wrong with vampy red! It&#x27;s just not to my preference, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a good red lipstick for years, and while I&#x27;ve found a few I liked, this one is the best shade I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have light brown/olive skin, and find that most red lipsticks are too pink, too orange, or too brown.  This is a deep cherry red and looks beautiful on me. I think it would look great on anyone.  The potential problems other customers might have with this lipstick: it doesn&#x27;t keep that freshly applied look for long (although it is so pigmented that your lips will stay red all day, you&#x27;ll have to do maintenance on it several times), and it tends to slide around on your lips when first applied, so make sure to use a lip liner, blot, and set the lipstick with a loose powder.  If you put it on bare lips, or put on more than one coat (this is such a rich color you don&#x27;t need more than one anyway), the lipstick will bleed a little.  I expected this since it&#x27;s so cheap.  I&#x27;m giving 4 stars because it was a $4 lipstick: for what it is, it&#x27;s good, but the quality could be better.</li>
