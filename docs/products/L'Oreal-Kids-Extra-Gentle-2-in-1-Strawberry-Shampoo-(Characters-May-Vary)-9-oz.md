      <li>&#x3D;) they will love it</li>
      <li>Cute Toddler Shampoo, my son loves cars</li>
      <li>His hair looks much better since we bought this.</li>
      <li>all the rest was a no-brainer:).</li>
      <li>It gives you a nice rich lather.  </li>
      <li>to use, I love it, recommend for people buy it, light and so convinence, shipping fast and cheap, so great and save a lot of money</li>
      <li>I think that the character on items like this makes a huge difference to many parents and all efforts should be made to delivered the advertised product.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo smells pretty good, doesn&#x27;t birth their eyes and leaves hair feeling smooth.  </li>
      <li>and I love how smooth and tangle free</li>
      <li>The shampoo is nice and thick and it makes their hair smell and shine great!</li>
      <li>The smell is alittle strong...</li>
      <li>It does smell good as long as you like that kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>He just won&#x27;t be super cute excited to see it.  </li>
      <li>The stuff smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic</li>
      <li>and this helps smooth it all out.</li>
      <li>I originally got this partly because my daughter loves cars and Lightning McQueen.</li>
      <li>any case, they were soooo excited about the lion on the bottle, and when I poured it onto their hair they thought it was strawberry yogurt.</li>
      <li>Although cheap from a cost perspective, it still isn&#x27;t worth what we paid.</li>
      <li>Also, we both love the smell, it is the closest smell to real strawberries than I have come across.</li>
      <li>... will probably buy it again if we don&#x27;t find anything else gentle with a bottle he likes more.</li>
      <li>Also the price is very comparable with most of non-brands.</li>
      <li>Smells really nice and not harsh.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m super bummed, but we&#x27;ll still use it.  </li>
      <li>The characters also add to the &#x27;fun&#x27; of hair washing.</li>
      <li>This is the BEST at detangling my girls long hair than any other shampoo-conditioner.</li>
      <li>However, after trying several &#x27;tear free&#x27; shampoos that weren&#x27;t really &#x27;tear free&#x27;</li>
      <li>This one came exactly as pictured</li>
      <li>My son and daughter&#x27;s hair ends up clean and soft.</li>
      <li>I was worried when finally switching from J&amp;J since he fights it so much but as soon as it&#x27;s over, he&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>No matter how much goes in their eyes they just wipe their face and keep on playing.</li>
      <li>I decided to find one that worked on hair and was gentle on the eyes.</li>
      <li>Our son likes Madagascar too, just not as much.</li>
      <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that you don&#x27;t get a whole lot of the product so it runs out pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>The character on the labels are cute, they&#x27;re a 2 in 1 but for my daughter I have to use extra conditioner, her hair is super long.</li>
      <li>Great smell and a little dab goes a long way</li>
      <li>worth it to not buy generic.</li>
      <li>We normally use</li>
      <li>This 2 in 1 shampoo left my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair in more knots and tangles than when we were using regular shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My kiddos sensitive skin is not bothered by this either.</li>
      <li>Extra Gentle</li>
      <li>But for normal to thin hair I think you would be able to forgo the conditioner.</li>
      <li>That was actually the main reason I bought it.</li>
      <li>for the smell, it does have a fake kind of strawberry scent I think.</li>

<li> for the smell, it does have a fake kind of strawberry scent I think.</li>
<li> you really can&#x27;t go wrong with free shipping, and the kids need to take a bath sometime...</li>
<li> We use this on my sons thick but straight hair.</li>
<li> It works really well on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair.</li>
<li> but I do feel like they should maybe give some examples or alternate pictures of these other characters.</li>
<li> My son has thick straight hair with lots of cow licks</li>
<li> The image is little different than I got from Amazon.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t bother his eyes or dry out his skin like other shampoos we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> all the way to the next bath night, even if that is a few days.</li>
<li> It was not good as old one I bought from other stores.</li>
<li> all the other scents had Cars pictures as well.</li>
<li> Even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 for my daughter&#x27;s hair I also use the conditioner from L&#x27;oreal Kids as it&#x27;s not enough as she has thick hair.  </li>
<li> Although she loved the scent, the product made brushing her hair a terrible experience.  </li>
<li> I have to say first that we were disappointed when we opened it up</li>
<li> but I can say this at least doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his eyes at all.</li>
<li> Not happy with this product.</li>
<li> is that it is not like you are washing their hair with a thin water-like liquid.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the strawberry shampoo came with Madagascar characters on it.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using it anymore.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m bummed for my son, but incredibly disappointed in amazon. :(</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this line of shampoos. Very good quality. Smells fantastic</li>
    <li> This is the only shampoo I buy for my girls hair. I like all of the Loreal kids shampoo&#x27;s, they smell great. THe one thing that put&#x27;s them above the rest is that it is not like you are washing their hair with a thin water-like liquid. The shampoo is nice and thick and it makes their hair smell and shine great!</li>
    <li> Nice shampoo for kids. Smells good and doesn&#x27;t hurt their eyes.</li>
    <li> Cute Toddler Shampoo, my son loves cars so I thought this would be a neat idea for bath time... The smell is alittle strong... But not horrible... This one came exactly as pictured</li>
    <li> Love the strawberry scent of this shampoo, it smells amazing!! And my son loves the car on the front of the bottle</li>
    <li> Love this line of products! Great shampoo for transition from &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; hair care products! Daughter loves the product as well!</li>
    <li> My son thinks this is the best!!!  So I have to keep it in both bathrooms.  He thinks it&#x27;s the best to be able to use \\&quot;cars\\&quot; shampoo and I think ordering it from amazon just makes it easier!!</li>
    <li> We use this on my sons thick but straight hair. He loves the smell and the characters on the front and I love how smooth and tangle free his hair is now. It&#x27;s much easier to style and looks great all the way to the next bath night, even if that is a few days. It doesn&#x27;t bother his eyes or dry out his skin like other shampoos we&#x27;ve tried. Will be using this again, and again!</li>
    <li> I originally got this partly because my daughter loves cars and Lightning McQueen. Also, the strawberry scent was really nice. It works really well on my daughter&#x27;s thick hair. It gives you a nice rich lather.  Also, we both love the smell, it is the closest smell to real strawberries than I have come across.</li>
    <li> We love these shampoos. The character on the labels are cute, they&#x27;re a 2 in 1 but for my daughter I have to use extra conditioner, her hair is super long. But my sons hair is perfect without extra conditioner</li>
    <li> Yum! This smells amazing! My son has thick straight hair with lots of cow licks and this helps smooth it all out. His hair looks much better since we bought this.</li>
    <li> Cleans kids hair, smells great, no tears!</li>
    <li> Good shampoo for my kid. He loves the smells of this shampoo. Recommend for parents who have kids &#x3D;) they will love it</li>
    <li> Not happy with this product. It was not good as old one I bought from other stores. The image is little different than I got from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Smells really nice and not harsh. Even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 for my daughter&#x27;s hair I also use the conditioner from L&#x27;oreal Kids as it&#x27;s not enough as she has thick hair.  But for normal to thin hair I think you would be able to forgo the conditioner.</li>
    <li> Bought this shampoo for my kids (2 1/2 and 5). The shampoo smells pretty good, doesn&#x27;t birth their eyes and leaves hair feeling smooth.  Only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that you don&#x27;t get a whole lot of the product so it runs out pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This 2 in 1 shampoo left my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s long hair in more knots and tangles than when we were using regular shampoo.  Although she loved the scent, the product made brushing her hair a terrible experience.  We used this five or six times and have since thrown it away.  Although cheap from a cost perspective, it still isn&#x27;t worth what we paid.</li>
    <li> Great smell and a little dab goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have to say first that we were disappointed when we opened it up and it didn&#x27;t have McQueen on it. That was actually the main reason I bought it. Their description does say \\&quot;Cartoon Characters on the bottle may vary\\&quot; so I can&#x27;t remove a star for it but I do feel like they should maybe give some examples or alternate pictures of these other characters. I just figured they meant it could be another \\&quot;Cars\\&quot; picture since all the reviews talked about the Cars bottle and all the other scents had Cars pictures as well. Our son likes Madagascar too, just not as much. I did upload a picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it does have a fake kind of strawberry scent I think. Reminds me of some type of strawberry candy. My husband thinks it smells like bubblegum. It does smell good as long as you like that kind of smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son hates having his hair washed no matter what but I can say this at least doesn&#x27;t seem to bother his eyes at all. I was worried when finally switching from J&amp;J since he fights it so much but as soon as it&#x27;s over, he&#x27;s fine. No rubbing or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good shampoo... will probably buy it again if we don&#x27;t find anything else gentle with a bottle he likes more.</li>
    <li> Smells great and the kids like the design on the bottle.  Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t be using it anymore. I checked the EWG website and this product gets a 5, which isn&#x27;t very good. I switched to California Baby Shampoo, which is way more expensive, but it has a 1 rating on the EWG website.</li>
    <li> This was for my son&#x27;s stocking at Christmas.  He LOVES the characters front the cars movies.  Unfortunately, the strawberry shampoo came with Madagascar characters on it.  He hasn&#x27;t even seen that movie.  I&#x27;m super bummed, but we&#x27;ll still use it.  He just won&#x27;t be super cute excited to see it.  I think that the character on items like this makes a huge difference to many parents and all efforts should be made to delivered the advertised product.  I&#x27;m bummed for my son, but incredibly disappointed in amazon. :(</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is getting longer, so we needed something that would wash as well as condition her hair. This does the trick! It also leaves her hair smelling wonderful.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for kids. This is the BEST at detangling my girls long hair than any other shampoo-conditioner. Almost as good as the stuff from the salon...worth it to not buy generic. Only one thing...could they make a bigger bottle?</li>
    <li> We sent a bottle of L&#x27;Oreal Kids Extra Gentle 2-in-1 Strawberry Shampoo (featuring Madagascar characters on the bottle) to Denver for our 2 week summer vacation extravaganza--you really can&#x27;t go wrong with free shipping, and the kids need to take a bath sometime...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, they were soooo excited about the lion on the bottle, and when I poured it onto their hair they thought it was strawberry yogurt. The stuff smells fantastic. We normally use Fairy Tales Rosemary Repel Shampoo and Conditioner during the school year, but I may change it up this fall and go with the strawberry shampoo and try slathering gel, hairspray, and mousse on their hair to keep lice at bay. The girls prefer this scent, and they really enjoyed picking out a bottle with their favorite movie characters.</li>
    <li> Great item&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, I love it, recommend for people buy it, light and so convinence, shipping fast and cheap, so great and save a lot of money</li>
    <li> We were a &#x27;whatever is on sale&#x27; family when it came to shampoo for the kiddos. However, after trying several &#x27;tear free&#x27; shampoos that weren&#x27;t really &#x27;tear free&#x27; I decided to find one that worked on hair and was gentle on the eyes. Loreal fits perfectly. My son and daughter&#x27;s hair ends up clean and soft. No matter how much goes in their eyes they just wipe their face and keep on playing. My kiddos sensitive skin is not bothered by this either. Additional bonus is the assortment of lovely scents these come in. The characters also add to the &#x27;fun&#x27; of hair washing.</li>
    <li> Taking into account that this is my childs favorite character all the rest was a no-brainer:). Also the price is very comparable with most of non-brands.</li>
