      <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much, so it lasts for a long time</li>
      <li>It is more like a spice scent, but not pleasant.</li>
      <li>use no other conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love Aveda products in general, but other conditioners of theirs don&#x27;t come close to this one, at least for curly-haired babes.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not buy this product. I used the shampoo and the conditioner and it left my hair hard as bark. I had to wash and conditioned my hair twice to soften it  again.</li>
    <li> I have used curl conditioners before and I have always liked them. I am familiar with Aveda and usually love their products. This one is not their standard. It does not have a pleasant smell and it does not leave my hair feeling healthy or curly. It did not enhance curl or decrease frizz any more than a grocery store brand that I was using while wating for the shipment.  It does not have citrus scent. It is more like a spice scent, but not pleasant. I tried to return it,but unfortunately, it is not satisfaction guaranteed. I am going to throw away the nearly full bottle!</li>
    <li> I have been gullible when it comes to advertising language, I&#x27;ll admit.  As such, I&#x27;ve become dubious when I see products targeted at yielding certain results.  But BE CURLY conditioner really does make the hugest difference for me.  I love Aveda products in general, but other conditioners of theirs don&#x27;t come close to this one, at least for curly-haired babes.  Do it.  And don&#x27;t look back.</li>
    <li> This is a great product with a very mild and pleasant natural aloe smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not convinced it is worth the premium price however. I like it 20% more than $8 bottles of conditioner, but it costs 200% more.</li>

    <li> My super-dry hair really appreciates Aveda&#x27;s conditioning system.  Sap Moss was my favourite; this is good stuff, too!</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner.  I have a permanent and it is wonderful for that.  It makes my hair curly, not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I use no other conditioner.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have curly hair and it can be difficult to maintain- especially for a 10 year old.  I bought this for to help with the combing/brushing. It works great- makes the hair soft and looking great.  It is expensive.....</li>
    <li> I love the Be Curly curl enhancer, so I thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner. It actually made my hair straighter than ever. It smells great, did the opposite of making my hair curl.</li>
    <li> This conditioner keeps my hair from frizzing, and has the advantage that if I need more, I can add more when my hair is dry (since it&#x27;s a leave-on conditioner).</li>
    <li> Works well, nice feel. Aveda&#x27;s products are normally very good. Doesn&#x27;t take much, so it lasts for a long time</li>
    <li> Dont see a big diffrence when using Aveda products.</li>
    <li> Again, may I thank you for this wonderful product.  Please continue to make it.  I live in a dry climate and it saves me time and trouble to take care of my hair.</li>
    <li> My curls absolutely love this product.  My hair is soft, bouncy, and healthy looking.  If cost wasn&#x27;t a factor, I&#x27;d use this all the time.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for my wavy hair for a long time and it is worth the money. I have tried many other products, both over the counter and salon, and keep coming back to Be Curly.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve found for my hair.  I still need the curl enhancer to keep the frizz under control.</li>
    <li> I love Aveda products.  Always have and always will.  But when I used this product, my hair just dried out.  Not sure why or what caused this to happened.  I didn&#x27;t change anything in my hair care routine except I added this.  I had to return it because my hair was extremely dry.</li>
    <li> I liked the curly leave in one before and didn&#x27;t know there was 2 different ones but I will try this too since it is so expensive</li>
    <li> great stuff...enuf said.</li>
    <li> makes my crazy large curly hair smell and look awesome</li>
    <li> The best product for naturally curly hair.  Just wash and go.  Ihave used this product for years and will continue.</li>
    <li> not worth the money if you have to use another product to style</li>
