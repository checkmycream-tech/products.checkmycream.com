<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great service , product exactly  as ordered.  Love this product.  Have been using for a year and my skin is noticeably smoother and clearer.  I have dry skin and find this a good deep moisturizer.  A little greasy upon application, it is absorbed within  minutes creating a smooth surface for makeup.</li>
    <li> Loved the cream, but the squirt bottle goes everywhere you have to have your hand all around it or it will go on your wall. And no there is not a clog in the bottle.</li>
    <li> Only product I have tried that works and is gentle on my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 2 months and have noticed that my skin is softer and there are less wrinkles around my eyes. I&#x27;m ordering my second bottle today. It has also helped my rosacea. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I mix with vitimian c. So 1 pump goes a long way. Worth the discount.</li>
    <li> loved it, worked great</li>
    <li> I bought this for mild sun damage and wrinkles. It has helped as expected with these problems. What I did not expect was it completely got rid of my rosacea! No more green concealer for this gal, I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation any more. Just some Porefessional, little blush and I&#x27;m out the door.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for this product.  After only 3 days I saw amazing results.  I&#x27;m a 68 year young woman whose face shows all those years lovingly displayed  in crevices and valleys.  After using this product those signs of joyful living are disappearing before my eyes.  I never thought I&#x27;d be saying goodbye to my wrinkles.  In some ways I&#x27;m experiencing a bit of nostalgia, but getting second glances from 20  something hunks is quickly replacing that feeling with silent giggles.  So, to answer your question about how it&#x27;s going--it&#x27;s going smashingly!</li>
    <li> Almost instant improvement. This is not oily or greasy at all. Not sure what people are talking about. Nice serum that soaks in very quickly.  Melasma appears improved. The smell is from the neem oil. If you&#x27;ve ever used a moisturizer with neem the smell can be shall I say potent. This is no where near that. In fact. I&#x27;d go so far as to say it&#x27;s pretty much fragrance free (with just a slight hint of neem).  I swim daily and this cream is now my go to.</li>
    <li> very nice feel.. light.. i&#x27;m using it for rosacea</li>
    <li> Great deal on this cream! It has worked just as I had hoped it would. The receiving time was better than promised!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with the whole natural thing so when I was looking into serums I knew this one was the best route to go and lucky for me I got an awesome deal. Organic free of alot of bad things you couldn&#x27;t ask for a healthier serum. It applies so easily and smooth makes my skin feel very silky soft (baby bottom cheeks) I love how it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily nor dry it out. So far I see an approve ment in my skin more rejuvenated and firm I feel. Thanks ♡</li>
    <li> This is now my 2nd bottle and I can say this product has been wonderful. I paid more than double last time and I&#x27;m so happy to see its finally on Amazon with a more reasonable price. I receive compliments on my skin and people can&#x27;t believe my age.- Always a good thing :) I totally believe this has helped improve &amp; maintain the condition of my skin. I also really love how soft it makes my face feel. It smoothed out some lines and really helped even out my skin tone. The fact that its all naturaland does not have parabins is also a big plus since i do all i can to not put chemicals on my skin. Overall its a 10/10 in my book. Great! Product!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two weeks but I believe it&#x27;s already making a difference in reducing my fine lines. Looking forward to week 6.</li>
    <li> I did not like at all</li>
    <li> I really noticed a difference in my skin after using this product....BUT  the product did separate also when I dispense the product it always wants to shoot across the bathroom and hit the wall or my bathroom mirror making a mess. Maybe a better quality bottle would help that.</li>
    <li> Product is wonderful! Would definitely order more. Feels like silk! Makes my skin feel so soft. Filled with natural ingredients that are so good for healthy, beautiful skin! LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> i am not usually a reviewer however i have to say that this product actually works. its smooth and it does wonders. this is a must get</li>
    <li> This B3 cream does just about everything! It has prevented my breakouts, it moisturizes, it brightens my skin and it noticeably reduces lines. I’m now on my now on my 3rd bottle and I’ve replaced my regular moisturizer with this.Face feels very soft and fresh every morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks now, and it is great. Leaves my skin feeling so soft. It has made my wrinkles around my mouth and my forehead look a less prominent. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few months! I am so pleased as I have tried so many products lately for my face and haven&#x27;t been as pleased. A friend of mine recommended it and when I saw the price I thought it can&#x27;t be any good since it was so cheap. I will definitely be buying this in the future!</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel so soft.  I get a lot of sun and this has become my go to product.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Truly and amazing product!!!!! Please do not discontinue.  I have tried many B and this is the one. I moisturizing to the point I do not need a cream. It spreads easy and is light. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Great product I gave it to my mom and she loves it and uses it daily doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin and leaves it nice and soft</li>
    <li> I am using it daily.  My skin does appear to be smoother.  Will continue to use to how much difference longer term wear makes.</li>
    <li> It a bit oily for my taste but then again many of the ingredients in this product are oil based. It will leave your skin looking oily and shinny but the results you obtain are well worth it. My skin is definitely younger looking and looks better. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and it makes my skin amazing. Definitely approve this product for the young and old.</li>
    <li> Great stuff I guess, didn&#x27;t notice any drastic difference really but felt good going on. And was light and not heavy.</li>
    <li> Excellent! I&#x27;ve ordered another bottle even though i still have a good bit left. Don&#x27;t want to run out. Great moisturizer and it seems to be making a difference even this early in the game.</li>
    <li> Overall it is a good product. Sometimes it looks greasy because it gives a little shine but nothing major. Havent seen big differences but have to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy the product but bought it because of all the other reviews. I did not see any difference in my complexion but more oily.</li>
    <li> At first thought it was working, but not sure anymore. On the fence.</li>
    <li> The product works well, it&#x27;s a little oily but seems to work well. My problem is that after using it for 2 weeks, the consistency has totally changed, it now comes out as oil, even though I shake it vigorously. It also seems that it is running out after 2 weeks of use (1X per day).</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for a few months now. I like it very much. It has ingredients that I like in a very light formulation. I do get compliments on my skin. I also use a vitamin D serum so I think the combination of the 2 is really excellent.</li>
    <li> There are products out there that charge triple compared to this product, THAT ONLY CONTAIN 2 OF THESE GREAT INGREDIENTS. Ingredients are amazing. Face looks brighter, hydrated and healthy glow. It&#x27;s oily so I only use as a night cream. Two pumps is MORE than enough. my sun damage on forehead has not lightened up. so don&#x27;t expect a miracle. if you have sun damage like me, you will have to opt on using pure glycolic acid for a safer peel or get fraxel treatments. Still such a nutritious product for your skin :)</li>
    <li> This is a great moisurizer that i have been using on my neck to help soften some lines that i have.&lt;br /&gt;They are not gone, but they are not as pronounce.&lt;br /&gt;Light smell and it is naturaly which is a huge benefit.&lt;br /&gt;I already purchased my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Since the first time I put it on I felt my face moisturized, and I would like to keep using it.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. It works great. Thank you very much. Super fast shipping</li>
    <li> This goes on like silk and makes your skin feel so extremely good. You can wear it under makeup or at bedtime to help to work against wrinkles. It is so hard to fine products that are truly all natural and this is the best I have seen yet!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have been using it for about a week now. And I see improvement already my skin is smoother and brighter. Pores are not as noticeable. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this a couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve noticed and amazing amount of skin improvement in such a short time., I have purchased many high end products and have never had the results I&#x27;ve received from this product. I&#x27;ve noticed brighter, more even skin tone and on top of that, I&#x27;ve notice fine lines soften even more. I will buy this again for sure. I only wish the pump dispensed the product a little easier.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel soft smooth and vibrant! Gave an even flawless look after only 3 days of using it!</li>
    <li> Nothing really impressive</li>
    <li> It feels very silky on my skin, and moisturizes well.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice a huge difference, but I&#x27;m going to keep using it daily.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any big difference since using it.</li>
    <li> I love that it has all natural ingredients. It goes on really smooth . I&#x27;m already seeing improvements under my eyes. Even my neck has had a few annoying lines soften and they seem less noticeable. I&#x27;ve also seen a slight but noticeable reduction in my crowsfeet . 4 drops is all I need for my face and neck so I expect this to last a while. One neat side effect was that I noticed extra energy since using this maybe from the b3 absorbing into my body.</li>
    <li> it is good in fine lines</li>
    <li> my face feels smoother and firmer with the use of this product!  I have only used it for a short time and already see a difference!</li>
    <li> No result after two months. Has done nothing to improve my skin. I have uneven skin texture due to cystic acne I had in the past. The product is super duper oily. It&#x27;s not for people with oily skin, but may work better for people with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, customer service is awesome. Overall 3 star product based on my experience.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous. They offered a great promotion on the first bottle and wow! I love it and will be ordering more! Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product on the first application.  It feels VERY oily and it&#x27;s shiny on the skin.  Reminds me of using baby oil years ago for sun-tanning, only more greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product and I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product a few days, but like it so far. It is a nice weight fluid that goes on easily..not sticky at all and moisturizes well.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time so that is a plus for Amazon .</li>
    <li> Very oily on my skin. But my husband loved it, and he uses every day claiming that his skin feels hydrated, soft and helps with wrinkle.</li>
    <li> Works well with my skin; good texture</li>
    <li> I have only had the product for about 10 days and haven&#x27;t seen positive results.  I haven&#x27;t had anyone tell me how long it takes to see positive results.  So, I can say that I have had no bad reactions, like burning etc.  just that I wanted to know when I could see positive results.  After all I have purchased 2 bottles believing I would see good results at a cost to me of $76.91.  If there is no guarantee I would never have made the purchase.  I would still like to know how long before I can see a difference????? I have no negative comments on your product, just hoping for great results.

    <li> I did not realize this had so many different kinds of oils in it. My fault for not reading the ingredients but it made me break out. I need a niacin cream without all the oil.</li>
    <li> This was a very high quality cream, I wish I would have ordered more when it was discounted price. I liked how it soothed and soaked right in just before bedtime.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  Have been using this for a year now and won&#x27;t use anything else.  It&#x27;s light on but gives a huge boost of moisture on your face.  I use it in the morning and evening.  Your face and neck will soak it up and you will feel so good after.  Try it and you will love this product forever!</li>
    <li> Have really noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any changes in face.  Expensive and not really worth the price</li>
    <li> Wonderful product and seller.</li>
    <li> I thought...Another overrated cream.  Did I really need another one?  I guess I did because I am now hooked and hope they never stop making this.  I realized the price had really come down from the original so it&#x27;s time to reorder in case they jack up the price.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels soft, smooth and pretty amazing.  I&#x27;ve worked in the beauty business for over 30yrs and I will say I&#x27;ve tried some crazy expensive creams that didn&#x27;t do anything but hurt the pocket book...So this was a very very pleasant surprise and a tiny bit goes a long way so don&#x27;t be turned off by the size.  It feels light but rich at the same time.  Crazy but true.  Love!</li>
    <li> Used it a couple times nothing great to report, didn&#x27;t notice any big improvement, if anything made my wrinkles more noticeable.</li>
    <li> Feels nice going on. I think my face feels softer &amp; smoother, but not really doing all that much in other areas---like lip wrinkles. Time will tell as to how great this really is. I don&#x27;t know how someone could see miraculous changes to their skin in just a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I love this. It makes my face feel and look smoother</li>
    <li> Love  It!!!!! I just ran out of  B3 cream and going to order more ! would Highly recommend this product! Goes on silky smooth and fast asborbing!!!!!!!! Does the job ! I put it on at night time!!!</li>
    <li> Love it!  I saw this on Dr Oz when a plastic surgeon recommend it and have been using it ever since. It has made a huge difference in my skin and softened fine lines</li>
    <li> Good creamy consistency. Good for dark spot pigmentation. Not very runny. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as Hylouronic Acid products.</li>
    <li> Was way too oily and made my skin look terrible.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because my face waslooking alittle dull latley and wanted something to keep me looking good so I thought I would try this product. Ive been only useing it for 2 weeks and my face looks great. I would reccomend if your looking for instant results.</li>
    <li> Great product, leaves the skin smooth and dewy.  Ordered 2 more already.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much! The one thing I didn&#x27;t really like was the smell of it. Other than that it had good moisturizing properties and I do plan on buying more in the very near future.</li>
