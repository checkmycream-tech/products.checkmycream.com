      <li>My skin so smooth feel so good</li>

      <li>This is why I love Mychelle products.</li>
      <li>(I don&#x27;t have many of those-- still in my 30s) were emphasized.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;No metter what this is perfact product i really love this</li>
      <li>Mychelle products not only work, they smell delicious which is an added bonus!</li>
      <li>I gave the product three stars, because I would like to expect more from the product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I love lavender.  </li>
      <li>Too many products have strong scents and I don&#x27;t care for this.</li>
      <li>It has a great natural smell, that smells like a glazed donut  3.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m easy to please--</li>
      <li>Goes on easy.</li>
      <li>This product as well as the Mychelle Serious Hylauronic Firming Serum, the Perfect C Serum (17% L-ascorbic Acid), and the Sunshield Sunscreen are my 4 favorite products in the Mychelle line!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using their line for several years and am totally happy with the results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;*Now, this one&#x27;s bizarre, but lines and wrinkles</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited for it--</li>
      <li>I used to change creams and cleansers frequently, because I never found one that worked, did not irritate my skin and that I really liked.</li>
      <li>But this cream is greasy gross and made me feel like it wasn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
      <li>Smells good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>like this mild fresh scent</li>
      <li>I love the soft smell.</li>
      <li>The consistency (viscosity) of this product is just right  2.  </li>
      <li>When you wake up even from the first time using it, your skin will be smoother.  </li>
      <li>I particularly like the older version of the night revitalizing cream, which has a sweet vanilla coffee scent.</li>
      <li>I absolutely, totally disagree with the so called \\&quot;review\\&quot; above, as this product is one of my favorite Mychelle products!  </li>
      <li>The product is very sticky and as I touch my face, it balls up and peels off.  </li>
      <li>It feels very \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, and come to find out the ingredients in each product really are \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Face feels fresh &amp; soft when waking up.</li>
      <li>This night cream after applying it just before I go to bed, left my skin feeling so smooth in the morning.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This product simply works, by keeping skin smooth with all natural, simple, effective, &amp; high QUALITY ingredients (NO chemicals/no petrochemicals, no cheap fillers).  </li>
      <li>The night cream also has a nice, calming scent and you only need very little.</li>
      <li>So beware the description is the old formula - the new formula has lavender and goji berries listed in the ingredients.</li>
      <li>Now I am not too sure about their products as my skin shouldn&#x27;t have reacted so badly, it&#x27;s basically healthy skin.</li>
      <li>We all need to use a skin care system that works together to maintain our skins natural ph balance.</li>
      <li>It makes ones skin feel soft and supple, recommend this to anyone.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*It&#x27;s completely greasy.  </li>
      <li>A rich cream that does not feel heavy on the skin.</li>
      <li>Worse than that, the cream (more like a lotion) causes bumps all over my face.  </li>
      <li>This new product is way too greasy for me (combination skin) and may work well for extremely dry skin type.</li>
      <li>I eliminated all other potential culprits ( makeup primer or makeup) but discovered it was indeed this overnight cream by Mychelle that was creating bad skin- very shocking to me as I have used MyChelle&#x27;s vitamin C serum and fruit cleanser successfully for several years  and appreciate the company&#x27;s claim of naturally good advanced skin care.  </li>

    <li> This is one of my favorite MyChelle products, it makes my skin feel healthy and drenched in moisture.</li>
    <li> The product does not work with my toner and brightener from other brands.  The product is very sticky and as I touch my face, it balls up and peels off.  Worse than that, the cream (more like a lotion) causes bumps all over my face.  Will never buy the product again.</li>

    <li> This is the best product line out there for skin care! The night cream is my favorite item that Mychelle makes.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any other cream make my skin so soft and supple. The smell is divine and you will notice visible improvement in your skin tone in only a few short days. Fantastic stuff!</li>
    <li> I have had great experience with the brand. I particularly like the older version of the night revitalizing cream, which has a sweet vanilla coffee scent. This new product is way too greasy for me (combination skin) and may work well for extremely dry skin type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mychelle for probably two years ... and I LOVED it...  but...  the packaging change is one thing - I personally do not like it. It WAS in a pump dispenser (glass) - NOW it&#x27;s in a plastic jar.  I&#x27;d rather not introduce bacteria from my hands every time I use it and I&#x27;m too lazy to use a paddle.    The real disappointment is the formula change - I&#x27;m not a fan of lavender and this reeks of it.    So beware the description is the old formula - the new formula has lavender and goji berries listed in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> I broke out in tiny bumps on my forehead which was truly odd for me as I usually only occasionally breakout around my lower cheek area if at all.  I eliminated all other potential culprits ( makeup primer or makeup) but discovered it was indeed this overnight cream by Mychelle that was creating bad skin- very shocking to me as I have used MyChelle&#x27;s vitamin C serum and fruit cleanser successfully for several years  and appreciate the company&#x27;s claim of naturally good advanced skin care.  Now I am not too sure about their products as my skin shouldn&#x27;t have reacted so badly, it&#x27;s basically healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I started using this night cream only a weak ago so I cannot tell if it will work or not (will update my review later) but all I can say for now is that it has a very strong smell which makes me not to breath through my nose for a minute or so. It also peels off my face which i don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Smells good enough to eat. I use it every night over Firmalift (which lets it soak in deep).</li>
    <li> I love Mychelle products and this one does not disappoint. A rich cream that does not feel heavy on the skin. My skin looks great in the morning. I have found this line to be beneficial for my skin.</li>
    <li> Received quickly, very nice as described.</li>
    <li> I totally disagree with Annabelle J&#x27;s review!  If you didn&#x27;t know, it can be damaging to combine skin care products from a variety of manufacturers. Plus applying a bunch of products not formulated to work together can also be just as damaging as combining household cleaners together. Mixing brands and products can lead to chemical discord with the skin. Some companies will formulate products within a certain ph balance range, blending to complement one another for best results. But one manufacturers range can be quite different from the next one. One brand may not work in balance with another brand. End results, skin becomes irregular and or unbalanced which leads to a number of skin conditions like acne, rashes and allergies. We all need to use a skin care system that works together to maintain our skins natural ph balance. This is why I love Mychelle products. This night cream after applying it just before I go to bed, left my skin feeling so smooth in the morning. I honestly could not believe it. Mychelle products not only work, they smell delicious which is an added bonus! I have tried almost every product by Mychelle,(I purchased 2 sample kits) and I can honestly say they are the best skin care products on the market today. Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> This cream caused bumps on my face.  This is the worst my skin has looked.  I threw it away. Will not purchase this brand name or recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d forgotten I actually bought this a year or so ago and hated it-- so when I got it again online I was so excited for it-- it wasn&#x27;t until I used it for a couple of nights that I remembered why I didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I love lavender.  This smells of lavender.  +&lt;br /&gt;*It&#x27;s completely greasy.  In a night cream, np.  Daytime, when I used it (I know it&#x27;s listed as a night cream) it was gross and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;*It stung my eyes.  This might just be a personal reaction.&lt;br /&gt;*I broke out.  I had a lot of small zits all of a sudden.  Quit using it, voila.  They were gone.&lt;br /&gt;*Now, this one&#x27;s bizarre, but lines and wrinkles (I don&#x27;t have many of those-- still in my 30s) were emphasized.  Seemed like this cream created them during the night or something.  Very very bizarre.  As soon as I quit using it and went over to coconut oil and my Mychelle firming serum, my face went back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-- it might work for you.  I&#x27;m easy to please-- I like to dress up now and again and play with makeup, but usually I&#x27;m a fairly low-maintenance sort of girl.  But this cream is greasy gross and made me feel like it wasn&#x27;t good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I only use Mychelle products since i found them.  Works great.  Very moisturizing.  Goes on easy.</li>
    <li> I have used it before and really liked it.  I am over 50 and have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I even use it sometimes in the morning.  It is wonderful for any skin but I think&lt;br /&gt;especially for aging or sun damaged skin.  There is nothing I didn&#x27;t like about it&lt;br /&gt;short of a mini face lift.</li>
    <li> MyChelle skin care products work great for me, and the night cream is no exception.  I&#x27;ve been using their line for several years and am totally happy with the results.  For sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the best!  I also appreciate the automatic re-order program from Amazon.  It saves money and time.</li>
    <li> Very happy with Mychelle.  I started using it about 2 months ago, and I&#x27;m very happy with the results.  It feels very \\&quot;clean\\&quot;, and come to find out the ingredients in each product really are \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.  I had been using the unscented night cream which my husband informed me is not \\&quot;unscented.\\&quot;. He said it had a very distinct \\&quot;scent\\&quot; and not all that pleasant.  This night cream isn&#x27;t unscented, but the scent is quite pleasant.  Thumbs up for Mychelle!</li>
    <li> I absolutely, totally disagree with the so called \\&quot;review\\&quot; above, as this product is one of my favorite Mychelle products!  1.  The consistency (viscosity) of this product is just right  2.  It has a great natural smell, that smells like a glazed donut  3.  This product simply works, by keeping skin smooth with all natural, simple, effective, &amp; high QUALITY ingredients (NO chemicals/no petrochemicals, no cheap fillers).  This product is fantastic.  Try it, you will LOVE it I am sure! Use this product on your face &amp; the top of your hands before going to bed. When you wake up even from the first time using it, your skin will be smoother.  Use it for a month (or less even), every night, for re-texturizing/smoothness!.  This product as well as the Mychelle Serious Hylauronic Firming Serum, the Perfect C Serum (17% L-ascorbic Acid), and the Sunshield Sunscreen are my 4 favorite products in the Mychelle line!</li>
    <li> Great product, I would prefer it without scent.</li>
    <li> Great product that is creamy and clean feeling, moisturizing. It makes ones skin feel soft and supple, recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the soft smell. Too many products have strong scents and I don&#x27;t care for this. It absorbs into the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> An excellent product.</li>
    <li> I do see some relief in my wrinkles, such as their tightening up, other words the wrinkles would be deeper without the cream.  I gave the product three stars, because I would like to expect more from the product.</li>
    <li> Face feels fresh &amp; soft when waking up.</li>
    <li> One of the better night creams I have used.  Nice light scent.</li>
