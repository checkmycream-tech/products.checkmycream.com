<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice natural moisturizer</li>
    <li> Wife seems pleased with this. And we are both happy with the price. She previously used the Josie Maran brand from QVC and hasn&#x27;t noticed any shortcomings with this one. Those that have purchased Maran&#x27;s products know those aren&#x27;t cheap so we&#x27;re pleased with the quality for the price.</li>
    <li> I use this product at night the day before I wash my hair. I rub a little into the ends of my hair and the dry spots on my scalp and it does wonders for keeping those spots moisturizer and itch-free. I&#x27;ve used olive oil, almond oil, cactus oil, and every commercial hair product on the market to keep my hair shiny and silky and none have worked as well as this. It is better than any popular brand hair oil and it&#x27;s cheaper! I will definitely be repurchasing,</li>
    <li> NO NEED LADIES to waste your $$$ on the higher priced oils. I used Josie&#x27;s for 2 years, but had to buy smaller and smaller sizes due to the way too high price off QVC for her brand. No difference at ALL! Other than the prices. I like being about to purchase a 4 oz. size, without paying over $100. AMAZON rules, and no need to ever go to QVC again, for what they claim, only they have. Big deal, they may have a TSV or something, but the prices they charge just to ship and add on the tax, makes their stuff way over priced. ALWAYS CHECK AMAZON 1ST! Very pleased with this purchase and want it on auto-delivery!</li>
    <li> I used a bottle of Josie Maran&#x27;s argan oil and liked it.  it&#x27;s expensive so I thought I would try this brand since it had fairly good reviews.  Well for one thing it has a smell (Josie&#x27;s had no smell).  It&#x27;s not the most horrible smell but still smells yucky, and thankfully I only notice it when I put it on.  but it smells just like a bottle of grapeseed oil I have from GNC, kinda makes me wonder if it really is argan oil.  But my main complaint is now the skin on my face itches all the time since I started using this a few days ago (and this is the only thing that changed).  So I guess I&#x27;m going back to the expensive Josie Maran brand and I&#x27;ll use this up in some body butters I made.  I&#x27;m bummed.</li>
    <li> The best facial mositurizer I have found.</li>
    <li> I was amazed at how well argan oil works on both my hair and skin.  I have thick naturally curly hair and the argan oil makes it noticeably smoother and softer. I like to mix a little in with my leave-in conditioner. I also use it on my face which tends to be dry and my skin feels smooth and moisturized.    I have also been using it on my kids&#x27; hair. One has curly hair like me and the other has fine hair that get frizzy and fly away. I rub a little into their hair and comb it through after washing it. It make both their hair much more manageable and smooth. It also works great to heal and soothe their chapped skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the hype regarding this oil, but I have to say it has exceeded all of my expectations.  I live in the dry desert southwest which wreaks havoc on skin and hair.  This oil is amazing. It absorbs quickly with no greasy residue and leaves my skin smooth as silk with a nice radiant and healthy glow.  I use about 4-5 drops am/pm and no other moisturizers.  Tiny line and wrinkles are indeed less noticeable.  Best of all, it helps the women of Morocco...</li>
    <li> In the past I have used the Josie Maran brand argan oil.  Because it is so expensive, I decided to try this brand--it was 4 oz for less tham what I would have paid for 1 oz of the JM brand.  I do like this brand, but I have to say that it does seem thicker than the JM kind...oilier I guess.  JM is more of a dry oil type and this is def more like a regular oil.  It does not seem to soak in as well, but I am getting the same results from it, it seems.  I use the same amount at night as would the other brand, but I do have to use less during the day under my makeup and rub it in for a little longer.  It is organic and certified by eco cert, which I really like, and mine had no smell what so ever.  I would order this again.  I also use it on my 5 year old son and it works great for his eczema and boo boos.  I do like the product and would suggest it to others despite it&#x27;s thickness.  Like it.</li>
    <li> ONLY USE A SMALL AMOUNT!  Will add shine and moisture to hair and tame \\&quot;frizzies\\&quot;, great as an allover moisturizer, super cuticle conditioner.  One bottle will last for months so it is a bargain!  I love multi-use products!!</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It moisturizes my skin and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference within a few days. My skin is softer and my face has a healthy glow to it. I would recommend this to anyone. Best of all, this argon oil is all natural and no chemicals in the product which is important to consider these days.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for the skin and hair. It will soften the skin and give it a great glow in the process.</li>
    <li> I first heard about Argan Oil on QVC.  It was supposed to be good for anti-aging, and as a 60+ woman, I&#x27;m always looking for something to avoid wrinkles.  Whenever I hear about a product I&#x27;d like to try, I check on Amazon to compare prices, or find a similar product.  This oil was less expensive on Amazon, and I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a month.  I put about 10 drops on one palm and rub them together and then pat on my face, even my lips.  It really does keep my skin more hydrated.  I was very skeptical at first of an oil, but so far, it hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts.  I&#x27;ve also been rubbing it into my hands before bed, because I have problems with my thumbs cracking open from dryness. I do use my regular face and hand creams on top of this at night.  I think it&#x27;s a great product if you can stand a little oily feel.  I do let it sink in for about 10 minutes before I go to bed, and haven&#x27;t noticed any staining on pillowcases or sheets.  I highly recommend it for anyone with problem dry skin.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY  WORK!!!  IM  VERY IMPRESIVE OF THIS ARGAN OIL AND THINK IS MAGICAL OR SOMETHING...!!  LEAVE YOU SKIN CLEAN, GOOD  I CAN&#x27;T DESCRIVE IT WITH WORDS...</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical, but was on a mission to find something a little more budget conscience than what I was previously using, (name brand \\&quot;Morrocan Oil\\&quot; that is sold in most salons and very expensive) but also be a quality product, ensuring it was 100% Argan Oil(I realize that&#x27;s a bit much to ask for cheap/good but I had to try). I must say I am very happy with this product and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it regularly.  PROS: I like that this product is 100% Certified Organic, that it has the dropper so you don&#x27;t waste, that you can use it on your skin (works amazing, my skin feels great) and I love the way my hair came out today using it. In addition to applying it to my damp hair, as suggested by other Amazon customers, I applied a little of the product to my conditioner as well. (What a great idea) Previously, I had bought the name brand Oil Treatment and conditioner. By adding this product to conditioner, there is no need for me to buy the Morroccan Oil conditioner, thus saving even more money).  CONS: Only 1 minor, I don&#x27;t like the smell BUT it does disappear very quickly, so it really isn&#x27;t a problem. Overall, you can&#x27;t beat the price, quality and amount you get.  I think this product holds up well to the more expensive brand name product being sold in salons. I am definitely going to buy again and again. And, by the way, my hair is very curly (tight curl, thick and shoulder length, frizzy and damaged from using Flat Iron. With this product I have re-embraced my curly hair and no longer use the flat iron</li>
    <li> It takes a little while for the Argan Oil to soak in, but I have a fresh glow.  And my skin feels soft and the fine lines seem less visible. I use it every morning and evening after cleansing.  I do follow it with a moisturizer. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my skin and it makes my colored hair stay in great condition. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it again. Would recommend to anyone, especially if you color your hair. But it is excellent to soften skin!</li>
    <li> I really like how the skin on my face and hands look after using this product. Thge fine line wrinkles were visibly less noiceable, and my normally extremely dry hands became soft and supple for 12 hours inspite of numerous hand washings. My job requires frequent hand washing. This works better than any hand lotion I&#x27;ve tried yet, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Thye pump is no problem--I ease into the punp to better control the amount that comes out. I will be back for more![[ASIN:B003XKY57S ELMA&amp;SANA® Golden Argan Oil 100% Pure Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -4oz(120ml)]]</li>
    <li> I have moderately oily, acne-prone skin that gets very dry around the eyes and mouth and is prone to dehydration in the drier winter months. (Right now, you&#x27;re wondering, why use oils at all? They&#x27;re great for keeping the skintone taut, dewy and even, and the right ones won&#x27;t break you out.) Have been using Silkia Camellia Oil all over the face at night (topped with acne treatments and eye creams) and using the Josie Maran Argan Oil dropper for touch-ups during the drier days. The JM was pretty good, but since I had the small dropper, I never really used that all over the face. Thought I&#x27;d try this product, and it&#x27;s fine, but the camellia oil is definitely better. This product has a thinner, water-like consistency--almost falls out of the dropper. Goes on easily, but I don&#x27;t think it sinks in or gives as long-lasting moisture as the camellia oil, which I&#x27;ll go back to after this is finished (or sooner, if the winter forces my hand)!</li>
    <li> Inspired by other reviews I went to ecocert website and did not find Elma Sana listed. And, I saw this coming as the oil worked initially and had no effect after some time...simple reason is it is not pure...I bought 3 bottles and I want to be reimbursed for this...</li>
    <li> I have only started using this Argan Oil on my face for the past week and I have seen a difference on my skin that I am recommending this to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up having oily skin with acne break-outs and now that I am in my 30s, even though my skin has stabilized and is considered a bit normal, I still do get break-outs and I was worried that this oil would do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels smoother and softer. I will buy again - that&#x27;s for sure. And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I like this Argan oil.  It is great for dry hair ends and dry skin.  It feels really good.  I am glad I found the larger bottle of it so I could have plenty on hand.  This stuff works wonders on your skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try a different brand of argan oil just to see if there is really a difference between the rather large selection of oils available on amazon. And there is a difference. Of all that I&#x27;ve tried, this is the least effective for me. It is of thinner consistency than others, has a very faint scent of generic vegetable oil and is colorless. From all accounts, the natural scent of argan oil is similar to olives and the color is slightly brown with consistency being a little on the thicker side. My favorite brand, Watts, has all these qualities and works great. I have used this one now for about two weeks; the oil does not absorb into my skin as well as the others, and skin feels dry again the following day whereas with Watts I can shower every other day and my skin stays smooth and moisturized even by the third day. Honestly it feels like sesame oil or jojoba oil which does not mean that&#x27;s what it is - maybe the method of processing takes away from the argan oil&#x27;s integrity. All is not lost, however; I can use it to remove eye makeup and will continue using on my body until the bottle is empty, but I won&#x27;t buy it again and will reorder the Watts which still can&#x27;t be beat. I understand that others like this brand very much but for me it is just so-so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****ADDENDUM*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just figured out why this is different from the Watts. The argan nut for this one has been roasted before the oil is extracted. Watts extracts their oil from the raw nut.</li>
    <li> My favorite Argan oil. It&#x27;s 100% cold pressed, so this is a great value. I use this&lt;br /&gt;everyday and night as my moisturizer and I have acne prone skin and it never breaks me out.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> I love this organ oil to add a few drops to my conditioner routine. Out of all the ones I tried this brand works best for me for that purpose in my hair.  This brand however the glass container has a rubber top that after a few months gets dissolved by the oil. The rubber in the top of the item starts to disintegrate somehow by the oil. I live in a climate controlled home with central air always at 72 degrees. It is not a heat issue but seems to be a reaction with the oil and the rubber plunger.  After a few months black rubber will be melted in with the oil. Has happened to mine in the last few purchases.  Now I transfer it to another all glass and plastic jar.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I use it for my hair already for couple years and my  hair looks much healthier and shiny. I am very pleased with the results</li>
    <li> I use this every day on my face, morning and night.  It has helped even my skin tone and gotten rid of most of the little bumps on my forehead.  I tried using my old Murad lotion for a little while, and my break outs returned in full force.  It took about 4 weeks for that to settle down again once I quit the Murad and went back to the oil.  I use it on my hair sometimes, too.  It&#x27;s light and not greasy unless you use too much.  The dropper really helps with that - I first ordered one that doesn&#x27;t have a dropper and made a mess of things regularly.  I&#x27;m going to pour that into this bottle when it gets low because I like this one so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(P.S. Please click YES below if this helps you in your decision!)</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve ordered this product.  I love it.  I use it in all my skin care products, lotions, shampoos and conditioners.  I apply it directly to my face morning and night.  My skin looks great!!!!  It takes years off my skin!!!  I have told several people about this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil and would have given it 5 stars except I don&#x27;t like the smell.  But I love the oil because I can add a few drops to my face moisturizer, or whatever i am using on my hair, or on my elbows or any other product or skin on my body!  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer, use on hair before shampooing, what a difference.  Great non greasy, absorbs quickly-miracle oil  Wish I started using it years ago!</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but this had a rancid odor. I do have the Josie Maran argan oil and that has no odor @ all, and it absorbs really well into the skin. I was trying to seek an alternative to JM&#x27;s oil, but discovered this is not it.</li>
    <li> I use this for my skin and my hair.  It is fast absorbing and works fabulously.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I ordered the smaller version prior to this one, I use it every night as moisturizer over my face , neck and chest area, use sparingly a little goes a long way, just massage in really good and nothing will rub off the pillow etc.&lt;br /&gt;I also think my skin really improved with it, I have much less breakouts or adult acne, as soon as you feel a little bump, dap a generouse amount just on that spot, repeat as much as you can after you washed your face thoroughly, I use lemongrass soap which I also purchased here on amazon. It all feels much gentler on your skin then the neutrogena products, which work well, but if you have sensitive, dry skin, that is sensitive against anything retinol, you definitely would want to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong the Neutrogena brand is very good, but Ican only use it a couple times a week , otherwise it dries my skin out way to much , and twice a week does not seem to keep my break outs under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con for the 120 ml version here was for me , that I did not like the pump as much as I thought it did it does dispense way to much oil with one pump, so I actually kept my small tiny bottle and just refill with the larger bottles content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can not say yet that my wrinkles , which I would describe of medium appearance for being mid 40th, mainly around forehead, side of nose going to mouth and above lip, but overall my skin feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely stick with it for a complete year, and review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recommend this product to some of my friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It&#x27;s great for face (especially under the eyes), all over body (especially feet) and even lightly applied to hair as a moisturizer. Simple, safe and effective---it doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
    <li> Very expensive for what you get. I used it in the skin and it worked like most other oils I used on it. Maybe works better for the hair...</li>
    <li> It literally saved my dehydrated and dry skin. After 2 weeks of using it I see huge improvement of my face skin. I also use it as a hair mask and just love it!!- my hair became silky and its volume expanded.</li>
    <li> Putting this on my face after shaving (electric shaver) is soothing. Keeps my skin moist without feeling oily (takes a few minutes to be absorbed). Also, makes my hair a bit better behaved (down, cowlick!).</li>
    <li> everyday use for mostly anything..&lt;br /&gt;I use it after shaving a few drops does the trick everytime for sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;in my foundation and&lt;br /&gt;in my body lotion :)</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and most oils just go right into my skin and then disappear.  The Argan oil just stayed right on my skin and felt amazing.  I would definately recommend this oil to everyone.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the oil! It is great quality and price! Fast shipping and I would purchase other products from them in the future! Again, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!</li>
    <li> Great on all skin. Renews essentials in the skin. I use it on my face first, then follow with moisturizer and sun screen.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It works wonders for my hair and skin. Never greasy and it never weighs my hair down.</li>
    <li> Before I ordered this product, I read many reviews of this product and similar products.  This received a high rating.  When I received this product, the first thing I noticed was the odor.  It had, not a slight odor, but an odor which, in my opinion, indicated that the product was old and getting bad.  Very disappointed and sad.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 1 fl. oz size argan oil from this company several months ago and liked the product very much.  This is my second order so thought I&#x27;d order the 4 oz bottle.  The oil is clearly of a different quality in the larger size!  It is not as refined (feels greasy) and it has a strong olive-oil-liked smell to it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time in winter. keeps my face/body/hair soft. Not so sticky. But not everyone may like the smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 months now&lt;br /&gt;I put a drop on palm of my hand and rub it then apply only on my hair ends&lt;br /&gt;it make my hair shinny, healthy looking, less fizzy without making it oily looking&lt;br /&gt;What I love the most about this product that it is 100% pure ORGANIC Argon oil no chemicals no silicon added and for such pure organic the price is unbelievable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though during shipment I lost about 2-3 inches of the product :*_*:&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it</li>
    <li> I have tried several different brands of argan oil, this is the best value for the price ( $5 an ounce when ordering the 4 oz bottle ) . The Acure organics brand has the same golden color and nutty smell as this one, but they charge about $14 for 1 oz, you can get it as cheap as $10 for 4 oz from  Essential Depot, but that one has the consistency and feel of vegetable oil and does not sink into your skin very well. I love everything about this one from ELMA&amp;SNA..I even love the blue bottle haha. I use it for my face primarily so the quality is important, I also use it in my hand lotion and mixed with my hair products.. when using for you hair remember a little tiny bit goes a long long way!</li>
    <li> Works Great, I have a short black hair. Gives it nice shape and shine. No more gel or wax. For most nights just argan oil! Plus I sometimes use it on face and beard great moisturizer</li>
    <li> I keep a steady supply of this argan oil with me at all times. It has a very faint slightly nutty smell that my fiancé loves and feels amazing on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t clog your pores, and I use it year round even on the humid east coast in summer. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brands and I find that the cold-pressed version simply absorbs the best and feels purest on my skin.</li>
    <li> Not all Argan Oils are alike.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different brands.  I bought JM&#x27;s first and like it alot, but the price is too high.  After researching the ones offered on Amazon, I ordered this one.  First, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; but goes away after a few minutes.  The other reason this is not my favorite Argan oil is because it is too greasy and heavy.  I use Argan oil all over my body but couldn&#x27;t stand this on my face.  Instead of returning it, I&#x27;ll use it on my legs.  I bought Pura D&#x27;or Argan oil.  It doesn&#x27;t smell at all, soaks into my skin quickly without making it feel greasy, leaving it soft....and the price is right!  Hope this helps if you are trying to decide.</li>
    <li> My hair is bleach damaged, and I was spending quite a bit on restorative salon products and treatments to get it soft and smooth.  Everyone&#x27;s been on about argon oil, and I didn&#x27;t want to spend much on the Moroccan brand to try it because my hair is usually too thin for oil based products.  So, I purchased this (much less expensive) alternative on a whim, and it&#x27;s replaced so many products!&lt;br /&gt;I use a few drops in my hair after showering when its still damp, and it styles smooth and soft.  Long term use has shown drastic improvement in my hair&#x27;s over all health, strength, and texture.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my nail beds to help with cracked, dried cuticles, and it&#x27;s done wonders there.  It moisturizes my skin, and I even use a tiny bit on my face instead of a night moisturizer.  It evaporates into skin really quickly, and is a really light oil so it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or sticky at all.  When you first apply it, there&#x27;s a little bit of a natural &amp;#34;nutty&amp;#34; scent that goes away after a couple of minutes.  It&#x27;s by no means a foul smell, just a really light scent.</li>
    <li> I find this oil versitle and of good quality. Use it on the skin and hair, to moisturizer without an oily feel</li>
    <li> Love this oil I put a few drops in my moisturizer everyday and just makes my skin feel really moist and silky.</li>
    <li> I have a natural curl in my hair and I get it done once a week by using argan oil every morning it gives it a beautiful shine makes it very manageable and its nice to get compliments on my hair. Also use it before applying my skin are on my face. I have very delicate skin but this works perfectly. Kathy</li>
    <li> This review is for how using the oil affected my hair. Firstly, I used this oil in many different ways on my hair because I really wanted to love it. For 2 weeks, I put it on my hair dry and went to sleep. Didn&#x27;t work. For another two weeks, I put it on my hair when it was wet before I went to sleep.  Didn&#x27;t work. Also tried to use it as a hot oil treatment. This didn&#x27;t work for me either. The only way that worked for me was to put very little oil on the dry parts of my hair (happened to be my ends) before blow drying my hair. If I put too much on my hair or any near my roots, it would look greasy. But just a little did the trick and my hair is back to normal again :)</li>
    <li> This is grade A Argan Oil, the real deal, and a decent bargain. It comes in a tinted bottle which is a mark of quality because the shaded glass protects against light penetrating the bottle and spoiling the delicate chemistry of the oil (I did my homework so I know what is good and isn&#x27;t). When you open the bottle there is a distinct nutty aroma is is a good sign that it is still fresh. The only reason why it doesn&#x27;t get full stars is because I have nothing to compare it&#x27;s quality to so I can&#x27;t say it is the best but at this point it is in my opinion. I use it as a moisturizer for my hair, just a little bit it to it tame it and give it some shine. It makes my hair soft and manageable and gives my jet-black hair a richer tone like an obsidian or onyx rock. .</li>
    <li> I am an argan oil fanatic &amp; have bought several different brands and am very happy with this one.  This is an amazing product that I gave my elderly father to use on his dry skin.  He uses it daily, his skin is baby soft &amp; he likes the ease of the pump bottle. There is no noticeable odor, it soaks in quickly &amp; does not leave an oil feeling on the skin.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I Love this product. Leaves my hair and skin silky soft :-) goodbye dry skin and dry hair.  i would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Este produto (óleo de Argan- Elma &amp; Sana) é maravilhoso, agora o vidro que recebi veio com tampa e conta-gotas e bem fechado além de vir com o suporte de Spray , simplesmente o fornecedor está de parabéns, muito obrigada, Elizabeth&lt;br /&gt;O vidro anterior que comprei vazava porque não tinha tampa e nem proteção para o conteúdo</li>
    <li> With argan oil you should slowly work your way up when applying it comes to applying it on your face or it will break you out some. You should use only like 1 or 2 drops at first. What I do is I rub it on my hands and then pat my hands over my face quickly as to not get too much. Doing this does not apply too much of the product for me. I of course put more under my eyes at night as it has amazing results for my under eye area.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th bottle, you cannot believe the difference it has made in my skin.  Less wrinkles and crows feet, more smooth, smooth, soft skin!</li>
    <li> This oil is amazing I have very thing hair and it just adds volume and shine to it . My face is oily in the summer and dry in the winter . It nourishes my skin without being to grease  . Perfect hair and facial oil . Definitely buying again .</li>
    <li> Before I always bought brand Moroccan , but that stuff is too expensive. Then I tried this one.  The price is more reasonable for me as a student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is absorbed very quick without making me feel greasy. And it has not scent. I prefer oil without scent.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I think this one is worthy.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  Protects, shines, smells wonderful and spreads easily.  I use it when I&#x27;m flat ironing my hair and it leaves it silky and smooth, moisture resistant, bouncy; then at night I apply a little to my ends and sleep on a satin pillow case.  Often I don&#x27;t have to flat iron again for two or three days.  Also so you know, I am african american with natural (no chemical process) hair.  I think my hair curl type is in the 4&#x27;s; generally typical hair.  I blow dry and flat iron to get it straight and then sleep on the satin pillow, use the Argan Oil and so on......I&#x27;m pleased with the product.  I hope it works as well for you.</li>
    <li> this argan oil is amazing. it has cleared my skin tremendously and it keeps my frizzy strands smooth, shiny and frizz-free. this has replaced my use of coconut oil for both hair and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at night, I cleanse my face using the oil cleansing method (50:50 mix of avocado and castor oil is my drug of choice) and apply 1-2 drops to my skin after rinsing. in the morning, I lightly rinse my face and again apply a drop or two to face. that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for my hair, after blow-drying, five drops seems to do the trick for a final finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice large size, good quality, no &amp;#34;odor&amp;#34; issues. I use it on my face, hands, hair and nails and am pleased with it for all areas.</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic, I use it on my face and my hair. There is very little scent, and it is so silky smooth. My husband uses it for his beard, and it keeps it very soft and manageable. I would have given it 5 stars, but the dropper leaks a little bit. Not a big deal, but can get a little messy.</li>
    <li> I was first turned on to Argan oil about 3 years ago from a local vendor at an arts market. He claimed Argan oil could be used for hair and skin (as a moisturizer), so I was intrigued! After using it consistently (morning and evening, everyday) for a few months, I became completely hooked and have continued to use it twice daily for 3 years, with 2.5 years of ELMA&amp;SANA use. I have tossed away all of the other harsh products I used to use. With continued daily use on my face, this Argan oil has faded acne scars, made my skin softer and smoother, and replaced a slew of cleansers, toners, serums and moisturizers I used to use that didn&#x27;t produce near the results that ELMA&amp;SANA Argan oil has produced for me. Now instead of spending hundreds of dollars every few months, I spend about $22 for the 4oz bottle and it lasts me about 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, I &amp;#34;oil pull&amp;#34; (oil cleanse) with Argan oil as my cleanser and then dab a touch more as a moisturizer before I put on makeup. In the evenings, I &amp;#34;oil pull&amp;#34; again and my makeup literally melts away. I then splash warm water on my face and pat dry, ready for bed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The greatest benefit for me is that I have been able to gradually switch up my skincare routine from harsh and poisonous chemical-laden cleansers and creams to an all-natural, 100% organic regimen. This is a staple in my skincare routine and I would be amiss without it. Combined with a clean, whole and mostly organic diet, my skin is positively glowing! In addition, my skin glow also benefits from 1/2 a tbsp a day of Green Pasture&#x27;s BLUE ICE™ Royal Butter Oil / Fermented Cod Liver Oil Blend and 2 tbsps a day of Great Lakes Unflavored Gelatin Collagen.</li>
    <li> very nice product - it&#x27;s a very light oil, to use on your hair and skin.  Not too greasy.  I will reorder when I get low.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a favorite and I have ordered it many times. It&#x27;s always been fresh. However, if you order one of the larger bottles I suggest you get a small blue or brown glass bottle (maybe one ounce) to store what you are actually using. Store the rest of it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh. The refrigerated oil will thicken up, but liquifies again at room temperature. I use a couple of drops in my hair after cleansing. I also put a couple of drops on my face on top of my moisturizer (especially in winter). I have very sensitive combo skin but have never had a problem with this product causing any breakout or clogged pores. I also like the fact that it is 100% organic oil and not some unknown quantity as is the case with many of the other &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> i love how it comes with its own dropper, makes it so much easier!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years - This was just a refill.  Very good for skin and hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product since it was organic and a good deal cheaper than other brands.  You only have to use this product sparingly....a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve used this oil both in my hair and as a facial mositurizer and oil wash and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or issues.  This is a good find and has lasted me a long while.</li>
    <li> I am on my third bottle!  I use it as a pre-conditioner for my hair (I leave it on 3 hrs before shampoo) and my hair is now long, soft and shiny. I also use it on my face and hands. It takes care of those little smiley wrinkles by my eyes and gives my face a good glow. Keeps my face and hands from chapping in the winter.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I wonder why it is quite a bit thinner than other brands I&#x27;ve used. It absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn&#x27;t have a much fragrance.</li>
    <li> I like and use argan oil every day, but the problem I have with this particular product is the after-smell, after using I use a cotton bath robe, and after 2 days the robe got a rancid smell. Other than that , the oil itself is good, it works good, it is the smell I cannot handle.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I have ever used regardless of price. I use it on my face, my scalp, my hands and nails.  It is not greasy or oily and absorbs quickly. I like that it is in a cobalt blue bottle to protect the integrity of the product. It is fragrance free which is an added bonus!  Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> I saw argan oil on QVC but it was so expensive that there was no way I would have purchased that brand. As usual, I searched it on Amazon until I found an affordable product that was comparable in quality. I am very pleased with this brand of Argan Oil. There is no smell like some have complained about with this type of product and I love the dropper bottle. I put a drop of this in my cleanser if my face is feeling dry, I use it to remove my eye make-up before I wash my face, I put several drops in my favorite conditioner and I&#x27;ve found that it completely heals any dry patches on my skin when applied full strength. I can also apply a drop to my dry ends  after styling my hair and it adds a nice shine. I will definately be purchasing more of this product. I can&#x27;t tell you how much better the skin around my eyes looks since using it. I think the best thing about it is that you can still use your favorite products and control how much moisture you want to add to them. I&#x27;m sure that will come in very handy in the winter months when my skin tends to get dry.</li>
    <li> this oil is OK but i expected more. Using good brand cosmetics gives you better results on your skin than this oil. After few days of use (morning and night) my skin was too dry, i had to switch to my regular creme from Vichy.</li>
    <li> I use argon oil every day.  REALLY helps to moisturize my skin.  Nice to get this larger bottle.  Josie Maran is good but much too expensive.  Elma &amp; Sana is great oil at a great price</li>
    <li> This is some pretty awesome stuff. It keeps my skin moisturized &amp; healthy. I use a dimes amount in the morning to get that natural glow &amp; it absorbs in my skin very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Growing up I always had oily skin with a lot of acne &amp; this product has reversed it completely. I&#x27;m extremely happy with this cheap, effective product &amp; it&#x27;s my go to stuff!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this oil.  It absorbs right away.  I use it only on my face.</li>
    <li> Lovely and worth the price</li>
    <li> Moisturizing for hair ans skin, no bad odor. Doesn&#x27;t give much shine, though. I use it to tame curly fly away hair.</li>
    <li> Lovely stuff!!  Nice quality and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> High quality oil and packaging. Great product and seller.</li>
    <li> Best purchase yet. I use this stuff on every single part of me! Hair, cuticles, as hand cream, add it to my body lotion, shampoo, AND it&#x27;s replaced my face cream 100% This is a great deal, great brand for this liquid gold! No neeed to go out and buy new products just add a few drops of this to your conditioner, lotions ect. My skin has never looked better. It even works on bug bites to stop itching. Can&#x27;t say enough good things. Pick this up and find 100 uses for yourself</li>
    <li> I got breakouts from using this product. I am not sure if it&#x27;s this particular brand or if it happens a lot with argan oil. Before I bought this, I read the reviews, and there were some reviews mentionning breakouts, and a response that said you could avoid that by only using this product. That&#x27;s what I did, I only used it in the evening, I did not use any other product with it, but I kept my regular skin care regimen in the morning. Surely they do not mean I should have used only that product both mornings and evenings! I could not use it in the morning, it was too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, with most products, all you have to lose is your money, worst case it does not work. But this is worse, not only am I out the money, I now have dark spots from the pimples I got using this. I would say the risk is too high.</li>
    <li> I love Argan oil and am interested in purchasing the best at the best price so I decided to purchase the four organic ones offered on Amazon that interest me the most. This review is comparing [[ASIN:B003XKY57S ELMA&amp;SANA® Golden Argan Oil 100% Pure Cold Pressed Virgin Organic Certified By Ecocert -4oz(120ml)]],&lt;br /&gt;with [[ASIN:B000GS8T0Y 100% Cold Pressed Organic Argan Oil 100 ml BY AAA Shea Butter]]&lt;br /&gt;and [[ASIN:B005GHP5UC Watts Beauty ArganGoldTM 120ml /100% Cert. Organic Cold Pressed Argan Nut Oil - Hair &amp; Body -Morocco]]&lt;br /&gt;and [[ASIN:B001PEZAHI Slice of Nature© Virgin Argan Oil. 100% Pure, Raw, Cold pressed. 100ml(3.5oz)]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing color and thickness, the oils appear the same. The only differences I noticed are slightly different odors and skin sensations with these four oils I purchased at the same time from Amazon. The AAA SHEA butter has a slightly musky / musty odor. The Watts Beauty has a slight deodorized odor about it and increases my heart rate slightly upon application to my skin and appears to engage my immune system as my neck glands will swell shortly after application. The Slice of Nature and the ELMA&amp;SANA have the freshest odor of the four with the Slice of Nature having the stronger nutty scent of the two; skin application feels very soothing and calming in a quenching sensation sort of way. The Slice of Nature feels a little thicker and leaves more of a barrier on my skin whereas the ELMA&amp;SANA seems to absorb in better and be less noticeable upon touch and less sheen reflection. This particular EMA&amp;SANA Golden Argan Oil gets 5 stars from me every time. The differences are subtle and most consumers probably would not be able to tell the difference at all. I considered not posting the review since any difference was negligible, but decided there might be others out there wondering the same thing.  If so, please click helpful below.</li>
    <li> This oil is fantastic for dry cracked hands in the midst of winter. So rejuvenating for dry dry skin. I&#x27;d put it up against any lotion or oil</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The price is great and it always arrives in a timely fashion.  Love argon oil.  Use it all over and if there&#x27;s any left on my hands, I rub it through my hair.  This is one of my indispensable products.</li>
    <li> I love this argan oil.  It is absolutely the best! I use it in my hair, on my skin and nails and it is a miracle worker! I was starting to get adult acne and this oil has almost diminished the scars left behind. Also works wonders on the little bumps on my upper arms, my skin is smooth and soft now. My hair looks so nice and silky without looking oily. You only need a tiny bit of this oil, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> great product! i use a few drops in my hair every day after getting out of the shower and it helps keeps it soft. this is also the second time i have bought from this company as well because they have GREAT prices and they ship super fast!! i got my product in 2 days!</li>
    <li> Product arrived in like two days and was packaged nicely.  Product is not sticky and appears to be high quality.  I use product after showering on my hair...too much will make it greasy.  I also use it on my face and love it!  Bought it for the price and quality.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this Argan oil is on the thin side and smells a lot like olive oil. I have been using the Josie Maran face oil and I can definitely tell a big difference.  You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I had been using Argan oil before, and love it.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is a miracle product. I have started using this over my entire face, despite skepticism about using oil on my T-zone. I use it on face, hands, and hair.  The only downside to this particular brand is the pump. It is too small  to work properly, so I just  use the dropper. Otherwise, I would  give it 5 stars.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff - order it all the time. Mix it with my hand lotion for extra umph.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this item. I am in love with the Josie brand Argan oil and had hoped this would be a nice replacement. The oil has a thinner consistency and the smell is not very nice. It is not horrible but I would not purchase again and am hopeful I can use the entire bottle rather than waste it.</li>
    <li> Why pay two or three times the price at different sources when the Elma&amp;Sana Pure Argan Oil will surely meet all your expectations and beyond? Simply put, it&#x27;s a great product at a very reasonable price. And it works wonders on seriously dry skin leaving it smooth and hydrated.  I LOVE it.  At first application I was quite hesitant because my very sensitive skin made the use of other  costly cosmetic items result in all sorts of ugly rashes.....not this one. The inital gentle scent fades away in minutes leaving behind happy skin, on both face or body. You&#x27;ll not be disappointed with the results! I give it a Five-Star rating for sure.</li>
    <li> This oil has different consistency compare to Josie Maran argan oil. it doesn&#x27;t worth the money, there is a lot of room for quality improvement.</li>
    <li> I love the effect Argan oil has on my skin and even hair, by rubbing&lt;br /&gt;a few drops in palms and running through hair when damp after a&lt;br /&gt;shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always blend Argan oil with a heavier, oil, as Argan is very thin.&lt;br /&gt;This brand blends excellently with olive, almond or others along&lt;br /&gt;with a few drops of your favorite essential oil (I add vanilla or lemon).&lt;br /&gt;It will stretch your Argan, and blends easier on skin. Even up to 50%&lt;br /&gt;Argan, my skin on face/body results are still positive!&lt;br /&gt;My skin does appear healthier and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;t24</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product a few times and this last time around, the product has a strange smell. It&#x27;s almost a sour scent of some kind. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s affecting my skin and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, so it&#x27;s probably OK, but it really makes me question the quality of the source. I&#x27;ve purchased smaller sizes in the past, so I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s the issue? It shouldn&#x27;t be but you never know...</li>
    <li> Equally as good as the more expensive Josie Marin brand.  Its a wonderful moisturizer.  I will buy this from now on.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> I use this for hot oil treatment and to seal moisture in my hair. My hair shines now. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great deal!  Feels so silky going on and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! This product is the classic FAKE argan oil: odorless, colorless, and perfectly clear.. The product packaging is also very clearly lacking an Ecocert label unlike previous Elma &amp; Sana products. I had a slight allergic reaction to this product (topical itching and burning when applied to the back of the hand), so if you decide to use this, DO A PATCH TEST FOR YOUR SAFETY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for with this one. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil, but it&#x27;s just too damn expensive!&lt;br /&gt;So after reviewing a bunch of cheaper alternatives, I decided to order this one.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, wrapped tight in layers and layers of bubble wrap.. so the shipping was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of worried about the plastic pump packaging, as shown in picture. When I saw the tight bubble wrapping, I thought, &#x27;great... the bubble wrap probably pushed on the pump and leaked all over the place!&#x27;  But it wasn&#x27;t a pump!&lt;br /&gt;It had a glass dropper on top with a rubber squeezer, which is the same as Josie Maran. With the dropper, I can control how much I want, not like the pump, not to mention it&#x27;s a waste of plastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so for the comparison:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: JM has more of a very feint nutty smell (I wouldn&#x27;t call it strong like some reviewers say about JM or other expensive Argan oil)  while Elma &amp; Sana has a very, very feint sour smell that resembles a hint of vinegar and few drops of citrus (in the bottle... I had to smell it for a whole minute to figure out what the smell was). But once applied, JM&#x27;s nutty smell disappears completely while E&amp;S&#x27;s sour smell disappears and leaves a soft nut/citrusy smell, which is unexpected but not in an unpleasant way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: Surprisingly, E&amp;S&#x27;s oil was thicker than JM. I applied a drop of both brands on my legs and tilted them. JM ran faster than E&amp;S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbency on skin: After applying a drop of each brand on my leg, I rubbed them the same number of times in a circular motion and waited. They both absorbed quickly, pretty much at the same time. Both do not leave a greasy residue. Absorbed quickly and skin feels very moist &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbency on hair: Surprisingly... E&amp;S oil absorbed faster on hair! I took a little portion of hair from each side and applied one drop of the oil. At first, both hair looked too oily... clumping to each other like wet hair. After stroking and massaging the oil into my hair, E&amp;S absorbed faster, and JM was still oily. When I took each portion of hair and lifted it up straight, the E&amp;S hair was standing, while JM was sagging... like it was being weighed down. Never noticed that before...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: E&amp;S 4oz was $26.99 whereas I got the .5 oz of JM at Sephora for $14 (and the 4oz is a whopping $96!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... I will buy from this brand from now on. I was worried about finding a good, if not great, cheaper alternative to the expensive from all the reviews. I thought I would probably have to try 3-5 different brands! But I&#x27;m very happy with the buy. I recommend this to first time users who are apprehensive about the high price of Argan oil market, and also to frequent expensive oil users who want to save lots of money!my hair, E&amp;S absorbed faster, and JM was still oily.

    <li> It absorbs smoothly.  There is absolutely no oily residue. It does not cause acne breakouts. No irritation with my rosacea. Make up goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> I heard about this a few weeks ago on The Today Show from the woman that wrote &amp;#34;French Women Don&#x27;t Get Fat&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;French Women Don&#x27;t Get Facelifts&amp;#34;! She swears by it and said that she didn&#x27;t even use any anti-aging cream, only Argan Oil! Even though she is older, her skin looked great with just some fine wrinkles!!! Since I&#x27;ve been using it I&#x27;ve noticed that the lines on my neck and around my eyes are alot less noticeable!!! Huge plus already since I haven&#x27;t been using it very long!!! It doesn&#x27;t take much though, just a few drops since it&#x27;s very heavy! I used too much at first and my face broke out, but hasn&#x27;t since I cut back to just a few drops, which will make it last for months!!!</li>
    <li> I had been using my sister&#x27;s Josie Maran argan oil, which is what got me addicted to the stuff. It made my hands and hair feel amazing and healthy. So, I wanted to buy my own but not spend a million bucks, so I ordered this Elma &amp; Sana. I do not know what to make of it yet. It does not absorb as quickly as the Josie Maran. It has a very strong olive or caper smell to it, which does vanish after it finally absorbs. I do think it is indeed argan oil, but I have to admit that I am a little bit suspicious of it&#x27;s quality. I have only been using it for a few days, and I do not really know what they mean by \\&quot;cold pressed\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read in someone else&#x27;s review that the company was not listed on the EcoCert website. I tried to find them myself, but I couldn&#x27;t find ANY list on the ecocert website for any company. So I cannot confirm or deny the ecocert claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good... for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this Argan Oil.  Put it on my skin and hair.  Great product</li>
    <li> Argan Oil, one of the rarest and most expensive oils in the world, contains numerous benefits as a miracle ingredient that not only protects and nourishes your skin, but reverses environmental damage, wrinkles and premature aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The active substances called triterpenoids in argan oil offer amazing skin protection benefits. Not only are they both anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial, but also promote tissue and scar repair and healing as well.</li>
    <li> Second purchase.  Slight smell that can hardly be detected almost odorless.  Smell is pleasant not bad.  Great for hair or face.</li>
    <li> Been using it for three years now. Cannot go a day without it. It had helped my pigmentation marks. Have not seen any new ones and my skin is better than it was. Always use it before a moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve watched several different television shopping channels tout it&#x27;s benefits but their cost was somewhat prohibitive....so I checked Amazon and found an amazing deal.  Love the way my skin feels after I apply just a couple of drops.  I also use it on the ends of my hair to condition.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am recommending it to all my family and friends! It is sooo much better than lotion! I use it in the morning under my makeup and at night after I wash my face. My face has never felt better! I compared this product with the Josie Maran&#x27;s argon oil, and I love them both. They are very similiar. You get a whole lot more bang for your buck with ELMA and Sana&#x27;s but it does have a slight nutty smell to it, while Josie&#x27;s does not, but for the price... you have to make that choice personally. They have the same affect on my skin. Very very pleased. :)</li>
    <li> Perfect moisture for my very dry face without all the chemicals!  I did not like the eye dropper applicator but working with it. :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on argon oil so I can&#x27;t really say if this is better then others. Reading other reviews makes me want to experiment and try other brands to be able to compare. I must say I do Like the bottle it comes in with the dropper. It seems to go on my skin really nice. I also put some in my hair for a treatment. No complaints.</li>
    <li> It appears close to the QVC type. It is easy to use. I will order more of this kind. I like &amp;#34;fair trade&amp;#34; items, because it goes back to the people.</li>
    <li> After having ordered the Argan Oil from another source a week or so prior, I knew what it should smell like and this oil smelled rancid. I checked for an expiration date and there was none. Who knows how long it sat on the shelf before I got it.</li>
    <li> This oil looked and felt like vegetable oil to me. It was different than other argan oils I&#x27;ve used. I was hoping to find a less expensive alternative, but I guess it&#x27;s true that you get what you pay for. I should have known better, as argan oil is not a cheap oil.</li>
    <li> I was a little concerned about using Argan Oil after reading reviews for several different brands, but I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. This particular brand is great! It&#x27;s not too greasy &amp; does not smell at all. Two of my biggest concerns. I also used it recently after my legs got sunburned and it helped with the healing and prevented me from peeling. Will definitely purchase again :)</li>
    <li> This wonderful oil is perfect for skin and hair. I use it everyday, and recommend it for everyone. Enjoy, enjoy!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ on the more expensive brands. This works amazingly! And it lasts forever!!!</li>
    <li> I use this product almost daily for my hair and skin. It works great as an emollient and light moisterizer</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife as a stocking stuffer at Christmas time.  Her hair stylist used a different Argan oil product in her hair a while back and it smelled really good and she liked it.  However, looking at the ingredients, it had a couple of products that I read were silicone based and decided not to buy it.  This was a much better deal (ounces/price ratio), but doesn&#x27;t have any real scent to it.  However, my wife does like the feeling of it on her hands.</li>
    <li> My sister turned me onto argan oil.  I have been using Elma &amp; Sana&#x27;s argan oil for the past 6 months and so far, my skin looks the best it has ever looked.  I am 35 and my skin looks better now than it did in my twenties.  People compliment me on my skin now more than ever. I worried about it breaking out my skin since I have combination, acne prone skin, but I have not experienced any breakouts at all yet. I only use 4 drops each time, so this will last a very long time. I like the smell of lavender and I mix a little of their argan oil with lavender in it.  I previously ordered the argan oil w/ lavender and found that the fragrance was too strong for me.  So, I just mix a little of the argan/lavender oil with the pure argan oil for a lighter cent.  This vendor&#x27;s products and pricing seem very affordable, but I would also buy it from another vendor if comparable and trusted. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but for me, this and sunscreen are the only two things I put on my face everyday.  I don&#x27;t even use a night cream anymore, just this. Hope you have a good experience with this too.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for skin and hair.  Noticed a difference immediately in texture.  Applied to clean dry hair, a drop or two goes a long way to smooth, moisturize, and add shine.  Just two drops after washing my face leaves my skin super silky and is non comedogenic (does NOT clog pores). I LOVE this oil.</li>
    <li> Good moisturizer that I use for my face. Not greasy with fast absorption. I am glad that I tried it.</li>
    <li> I use Josie Maran on my face, but it is too expensive for using on my legs and arms in the winter of dry skin.  So I have purchased several of the Elma&amp;Sana for that purpose.  Got my sister using the oil as well.  Great for dry skin.</li>
    <li> The oil is so light and perfect and the great its come in a glass bottle that will prevent the oil from being spoil</li>
    <li> I have very difficult to treat facial skin due to several health conditions. It&#x27;s dry and aging, it&#x27;s oily, I&#x27;m prone to rashes and I have several forms of acne going on. I usually treat my skin with a heavy duty, expensive vitamin C and retinol serum, but I had to give it up when I became pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is working a little more slowly than my serum, but I&#x27;m getting good results. Red marks are disappearing, and the active acne bumps are flattening out. My old serum would plump up my skin and fade redness temporarily, leaving a sticky residue; the acne was hidden, but always there. However, this argan oil is conditioning my skin and repairing it; the results really seem to be building day by day. The oil take a moment to sink into my skin, but once it does, it&#x27;s weightless. Problem spots flake away in the morning, leaving less noticeable, fading spots underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using a gentle cream cleanser, a facial brush, and this oil--that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m very pleased with the quality and the price is reasonable enough that I&#x27;ve started using it as a body moisturizer. I started using this in winter, so I don&#x27;t know how it will stand up to heat and humidity (sweat, hives, dermatitis--yuck) but  plan to stick with it after pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle I received had a dropper and not a pump. The oil is a bit too heavy to be controlled by the dropper. You have to be very careful when using it, or oil drips down the sides of the bottle. I would have preferred the pump dispenser, as it&#x27;s tidier and more sanitary, but the product itself is still great.</li>
    <li> It is a good argain oil I. This oil really save my life  in a moment that i though there is no solution for a dissease I have.. the condition is peyronie&lt;br /&gt;Im consider to buy the 32oz for 80$ dollars.. This really saved my  life . thanks</li>
    <li> Re Argan Oil- This is one of the best products I have ever used.My skin feels beautiful, soft and smooth after I use it.I can recommend this product to anyone who wants the best  out there for their skin.The Elma &amp; Sana co was wonderful to deal with and I will be back to order again.</li>
    <li> I was a little leery about using this on my face, but it is wonderful. My skin is smooth and soft. This product doesn&#x27;t feel oily on the skin and absorbs quickly. You do not need to use much. I am seeing some improvement with deep wrinkles. I will be buying more of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to compare to Josie Maran and although it was okay, it did not compare. Smell was fine but it was a bit greasier and took longer to absorb than Josie Maran. Not sure if I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a good price. Have tried another brand and this one is superior. Light but effective. I love how it softens the hair without any greasiness.The same can be said if you want to use it on your skin.Little to no fragrance,which I prefer. I would purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I so love this! It comes with a spray pump also, options....I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in this product compared to others because it is cold pressed. Will repurchase in the near future</li>
    <li> the item I received was one ounce and it was supposed to be four ounces.Maybe we can fix that, eh?</li>
    <li> Great! I need some more</li>
    <li> Second bottle: I like this product very much, it leaves my skin soft and supple. My skin drinks the oil and does not leave an oily, greasy residue. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> The price on this is the best I&#x27;ve found.  I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s been doing anything, but I&#x27;ll keep using it until it runs out. I read many reviews on different kinds and a lot of people say different things. From my use, it works similar to lotion but I never know how much to use. Sometimes it feels greasy and sometimes I feel like I need more. I used on my hair and body and both feel fine, although I was hoping that my hair would get a little less dry, but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to help too much. Also the small isn&#x27;t bad like some people say, I can see why they would say it&#x27;s bad but it&#x27;s fine. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I use it on my face, elbows and hair in that order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase of this company&#x27;s Argan oil. I recommend buying the larger size. I wish that I had the first time. It&#x27;s just such a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I am a health fanatic, I research everything that I use on my skin very throughly. I have resorted to making my own body butters instead of buying lotion since good quality skin care is hard to find. I believe in putting only the finest products on my skin without all of the added fluff most lotions have, even organic lotions. Through all my research I came across this pure Aragon oil and it has made my life so much easier! I don&#x27;t have to make my own lotions anymore because tho pure oil is the best moisturizer! I put it on my skin and I get so many compliments on the texture and softness of my skin. It is not greasy and soaks right in. It can get expensive to only use this oil, so I put it together with a little bit of raw unrefined shea butter and my skin glows! I would definitely give this a try!</li>
    <li> I love Elma &amp; Sana Argan Oil, I use it on my face and hands. I started using Argan Oil when  I received it  in a beauty kit, when I went  to purchase  it again at a large make up store, I could not believe how expensive it was. I was glad to find it on Amazon at a very affordable price.  I have trouble with clogged pores and milia pimples from other moisturizers,  this does not clog pores or give me milia pimples.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love it! I was using the Josie Maran brand. That was the only brand I had ever heard of. It is the one that gets all the publicity. But I had to quit using it months ago because it is so expensive. Almost $50 for less than 2 oz! I had no idea that there were other brands that sold argan oil. I found this on amazon.com and was so excited. And I think this is better than the other brand! The oil actually has a slight color and scent of argan, unlike the other. It is also thicker and make me feel like it does more because the other brand is more runny. This is a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used about 4 other argan oil brands and some didn&#x27;t seem all that moisturizing while others actually burned my sensitive skin. I love this brand--always smells like argan oil should, very moisturizing and soothing.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been doing my research on Argan Oil and found out that this would work best for my budget. After receiving it in the mail I was so excited I put it on ALL of the time. I used it on my hair, body and face. After about a week I would notice I was getting really big pimples on my forehead, which is where I would use it to help prevent wrinkles. Well, I&#x27;ve stopped using it on my face because these pimples weren&#x27;t normal ones, they felt like really huge things that over took half of my face!  Plus they hurt. So I&#x27;ve stopped using it on my face and focused on my body, the heels of my feet (I wear a lot of flip flops) and hands. I have to say that I&#x27;m really happy with it overall. Especially when it gets to be dry, this always feels so much better putting it on my hands than regular lotion would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump to this bottle is ok. Sometimes I can&#x27;t just get a small amount that I want, but I just end up rubbing it in my hands anyway.</li>
    <li> My second bottle of Argan oil was rancid, but as soon as I mentioned it (did not even expect an answer) the company called and emailed me immediately to apologize and sent me a new bottle without me even asking for it. Great service, continual contact and my new bottle was as fresh as the morning dew. I love this oil and the price and it compares great with other more expensive brand names. Thank you for your great service.</li>
    <li> It works just fine...I recommend it for anyone looking for a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My wife bought this as a supplemental moisturizer since our winters can get pretty brutal.  She really likes that it absorbs into her skin quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. It&#x27;s also a very reasonable price considering some companies sell it at over $50 a bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this oil. I use it daily on my face and hair.</li>
    <li> little bit thicker than my previous one.smell is not that bad.it smells like wood.feels sticky on skin with one drop.</li>
    <li> This is beautifully emollient, and so is worth the angst associated with using it.  Real argan oil is derived from goat poop in Morocco. Trouble is, one doesn&#x27;t know if it is the real thing or an imitation (which might be better!)/</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks. Works good so far. Will update with further use. Takes time to see results.</li>
    <li> i switched from using different face lotions, organic and sensitive skin and this and that, and after lots of research on what to do found out that argan oil is the way to go.  one pump every day and my face looks great.  after months of use i have less redness, greatly reduced breakouts (also, have greatly changed my diet over the last 2 years which helps).  i don&#x27;t wear make up much but when i do it floats on may face, no caking.  i will never go back to lotions.  i am not sure i will always use this brand of oil, but never lotion again.  don&#x27;t let &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; scare you because you use it on your face....</li>
    <li> I can say enough of this product... will keep ordering... I used it on my hair, hands and as a face mosturizer and even on my  schnauzer&#x27;s schnauze</li>
    <li> works well price is reasonable and I need to put more words down but don&#x27;t want to blah blah blah</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  I work outside and in very dirty dry areas when indoors.  This has helped my skin very much and has saved me much money on body lotions.  I use before my lotion (a few drops on the hand, rub together feel the warmth, then rub on) and by time I have covered my body this way I am ready to put lotion on.&lt;br /&gt;Usually when I get home from work my skin would be so dry and crackly looking but using this just a few days I saw and felt a difference.  I have been using this oil for a over a year now and my skin is just so improved.  My legs and back area have improved greatly.&lt;br /&gt;This is not heavy if you use it the proper way for your skin.  I have not had any breakouts and I have used it on my face (under my regular face treatment) in the winter when I am out in the cold wind.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every season of the year.  Wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous! I never had a problem with my orders. The Argon oil quality is excellent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been doing oil cleaning method for a while now, and this product is great. Loads of vitamin E and clears up your skin (just give it time to work and you&#x27;ll be glad you did.)</li>
    <li> I love aragon oil! Elma&amp;Sana&#x27;s product is awesome, i used it every night and in all my lotions for that extra moister.</li>
    <li> I have been using this know for a couple of months, I love the feel of my skin and it is not greasy, I have long hair and I shampoo it everyday and it keeps my ends from drying.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this for zits, when I get up to three zits, they seem to take forever to go away. Before I would have to buy all sorts of acne creams and they still took forever to go away. Even the moisturizers for the face I am not really fond of, I found only one that I like. Then I was reading about organic argan oil and the many benefits. I really got this for my hair, I was going to just use sulfate free shampoo and then use this for leave in conditioner. Well the time I started doing that, I got a annoying zit and my t-zone was really dry. So I gave this a shot and started using it on my face. I started with the dropper, too messy. Then I used the pump that came with it, and I just use not even a full pump and spread this on my face, my ears and neck. The zits redness and pain go down right away, and then there is nothing!!!! I&#x27;m super happy!!!! Now I wont have to buy all sorts of face moisturizers, and just use this!!! Even my boyfriend uses it only when he gets a zit and he loves it!!! I got two other argan oils to compare, and so far I&#x27;ve tried all three that I bought, but I use this one a lot more. When I get done with this, then I&#x27;ll use another one to see and write a review on it, and then go to the last one. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be sticking with one of these!! I will never buy anymore acne cream ever again, just face wash then use this, oh and all my smile lines around the eyes have gone away!!!</li>
    <li> They better not make this more expensive! It is affordable, whereas the exact same product is 3x more expensive for a better known brand.&lt;br /&gt;I love this. I wash my face, pat it with a towel to get excess water off but so that it is still damp, drop a few drops onto my fingertips and gently massage into my face. Every morning and evening. I have very combination skin, so I get very dry but also have an oily T-Zone, mostly in my forehead. I do need to put a bit of powder on my T-Zone after applying foundation to keep it matte.&lt;br /&gt;This does not give you oily skin however, just highly moisturized and glowing. You look like you have very smooth, healthy skin. I am fairly young but already have nicer skin than many my age. I have been using this for about a year, and going between Olay Regenerist and coconut oil before that.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite, I bought it in a 2 oz bottle before and had no complaints in fact that is a 5 star product with no smell and the thickness of oil is perfection. This 4 oz bottle seems a little different in texture barely more runny and actually has a smell.  I can&#x27;t understand why since I have the 2 oz bottle to compare it to.  Sort of bummed but I&#x27;m keeping it and will go back to purchasing the 2 oz bottle next time -I&#x27;ve bought other brands and smell is an issue on some others so beware.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times &amp; am a very satisfied customer. My skin loves it too -Constantly getting compliments on how great it looks. Bought it on Amazon from Elma &amp; Sana.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible product that it has transformed my hair. I live in South Florida and this product has help me to tame my hair in a high humidity environment. I highly  recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of 100% pure cold pressed Argan.&lt;br /&gt;Will but it again.</li>
    <li> Although the actual oil is the same as others, it is the glass packaging especially the eye-dropper that initiated a 2 rating. The glass eye-dropper is extremely fragile and I dropped it and the tip of it shattered and then the oil would run all over the place when I tried to use it. It should be plastic because we are working with oil and your hands get slippery. I won&#x27;t buy it again since the bottle is glass as well. I have to be constantly watching to make sure I don&#x27;t drop the bottle. I admit, it was my fault for dropping it but oil and glass don&#x27;t mix. I will make sure to purchase plastic bottles in the future. The idea of the eye-dropper is somewhat of an inconvenience too. I like the plastic with the tops that you can tip and the oil comes out in drops.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand of Argan Oil for about 6 months. Yesterday I went to see my chiropractor and he asked me if I had changed my diet since I last saw him 4 months ago. I asked why, and he said the wrinkles I had in my face when I last saw him have filled in and my face is so smooth that he just could not believe that I was 70! I tried other more expensive brands and they didn&#x27;t do anything for my face like this one does. I am reordering the 4 oz bottle today!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying Argan Oil on my body. I have yet to use it on my face, but because of all the rave for argan oil, I thought I should give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before Argan Oil, I&#x27;ve tried extra virgin olive oil (organic) and also Trader Joe&#x27;s jojoba oil (100% &#x27;pure&#x27; but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s organic). I have to say that the consistency is somewhere between the two, leaning more towards olive oil and even smelling more like olive oil. The jojoba oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s was the right consistency for me: it was oily but a tad bit more runny which is more appropriate for body oil and easier spread. It also absorbs easier. This may mean that it&#x27;s not as &#x27;organic&#x27; or &#x27;pure&#x27; as this argan oil, but it&#x27;s really all about your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil absorbs quite well but it&#x27;ll take a while to absorb so make sure you give it some time to sink into your skin because it&#x27;s not exactly instantaneous like most body lotions are. I have to say that this would probably make an excellent moisturizer in the winters when the air is very cold and dry, but perhaps not so appropriate for summer/hotter climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a good product, but like I said it&#x27;s all about preference. If you want something thick like extra virgin olive oil, the consistency is pretty similar except olive oil is thicker. I tried using this on my lips but I think I might have put too much? Somehow it didn&#x27;t sink very well.. Maybe next time I just need to dab a tad bit, but it doesn&#x27;t feel as moisturizing as my organic EOS lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a natural moisturizer in the winter, this will be good but remember that it is on the pricey side for a small bottle. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (11/9/2012):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought the Josie Maran starter kit which came with a very small bottle of their Argan Oil. I just want to make a short comparison here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency:&lt;br /&gt;JM - Lighter, runnier, not as runny as Trader Joe&#x27;s Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;E&amp;S - Thicker(than expected), but still not as heavy as extra virgin olive oil. Somewhere in between evoo and JM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell:&lt;br /&gt;JM - Unscented (for me at least.. I really don&#x27;t smell anything I don&#x27;t know why people think there&#x27;s a nutty smell to it)&lt;br /&gt;E&amp;S - More nutty, towards vegetable oil scent. When putting it on my body I feel like I&#x27;m about to put myself in the frier or something, lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absorbency on skin:&lt;br /&gt;JM - Fast, but not as fast as lotion&lt;br /&gt;E&amp;S - Takes quite a while (I always use it after a shower, I don&#x27;t know if that affects the absorbency rate)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing level:&lt;br /&gt;JM - Better for face, lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. Skin can still breathe and after it absorbs the initial \\&quot;slick\\&quot; oil feeling is gone&lt;br /&gt;E&amp;S - Better for body, heavier, takes longer to absorb but moisturizes and lasts longer imo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Conclusion -&lt;br /&gt;I find that JM is better on the face because: 1) unscented 2) lighter feel 3) not too heavy to make my face break out. I also only use it at night when I&#x27;m about to sleep because I don&#x27;t like oily face during the day.&lt;br /&gt;E&amp;S is better as a body moisturizer, though I guess if you don&#x27;t mind the weirdly nutty/vegetable smell, you could put it on your face too if it&#x27;s super dry. I wouldn&#x27;t lather it on though, I feel like just a few drops would be more than good enough.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy using this product. It feels light and absorbs quickly. I apply make up over it right away. I haven&#x27;t noticed any thing different in my skin appearance. But I will continue using it because of how it make my skin feel.</li>
    <li> I bought this in a smaller size and liked it so much I bought it in the larger size. Now it is not the do everything for your skin it says it is, at least not for me.  But it works very nice for certain things. I like to use it on my upper eyelids, it works better than anything else I have tried . But use only a tiny amount because if any gets in your eyes they will water for hours. I also like it for the fine lines around my mouth.  Also great on hands......takes a few years away from the appearance and they  feel like silk.  Absorbs well and no fragrance to irritate my allergies. I&#x27;m sure it works nice for dry skin on arms and legs, but I prefer regular lotions for these. i would recommend it for these uses.</li>
    <li> This product does have a small odor but it is not unplesant.  I have allergies to all kinds of fragrances but this product does not cause me any problems.  I will purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> It seems to be really softening my old skin and making many of the lines disappear! I didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
    <li> Really good product, great price. Great for hair to use overnight, or add to shampoo, use after swimming or in the sun.</li>
