      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This massage lotion was very calming and soothing.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t really smell it though.</li>
      <li>so I just use a little more and there&#x27;s no issue.</li>
      <li>I used this oil after bathing, just to try it on the skin, and it left my skin soft without an overpowering scent, unlike the Exotic Aroma oil from the same company.  </li>
      <li>i think it&#x27;s a little strong, the wife doesn&#x27;t)</li>
      <li>I already used this oil for massages with my clients and have treated 5 clients so far and the bottle still have plenty left 8/8 full left.</li>
      <li>I feel like it is a pretty large container for the price, it will last me a long time!</li>
      <li>I used this as a bath oil and a moisturizer directly after the bath--</li>
      <li>When using, it lasted a long time before absorbing into the skin.</li>
      <li>Spill a little on a sheet or blanket and it comes right out in the wash with no signs of staining or discoloration.</li>
      <li>I was able to massage a little longer than usual.  </li>

<li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
<li> This is a lightly scented oil, without a lingering unpleasant odor.  </li>
<li> The oil can last a while all you need is a small amount</li>
<li> The Exotic Aroma turned a little funky-smelling on the skin after use with the massage stones giving me a sickly feeling.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s thick enough that you don&#x27;t need a lot, but it still absorbs well in the end.</li>
<li> Unfortunately has an overwhelming smell of stale peanuts.</li>
<li> but my partner thought her skin felt a little greasy.</li>
<li> I tried quite a few oils until I found this one, and I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
<li> I highly recommend the Soothing Blend oil, and slept with it on the skin without unpleasant effect.  </li>
<li> The oil base must have been old.</li>

    <li> I liked this one the best.</li>
    <li> The massage oil is great, smooth and not heavy. The smell is potent, so if you don&#x27;t like lavander I&#x27;d stick with the unscented. The bottle looks nice. However the label is not at all like the one shown in the photo and is closer to paper than a plastified label. If you reach for the bottle and your hands are oily you will get oily hand marks all over your label. Not that big of a deal, its just that this was going to be part of a bigger gift and I spoiled the label by picking it up with oily hands! They will be getting a different massage oil and I&#x27;m keeping this one!</li>

    <li> gets the job done…not too oily. can&#x27;t really smell it though. works good for my in home massages from the husband.</li>
    <li> I used this as a bath oil and a moisturizer directly after the bath-- it does moisturize the skin quite well but my partner thought her skin felt a little greasy. (I have drier skin than her though.) The scent is the really awesome part of this. Its light, but still somewhat noticeable during a bath or massage, which is just what I was looking for. For the price, its a very good value as well.</li>
    <li> I purchased the unscented &#x27;Master Massage Oil&#x27; for the rest of the entire body. A little bit goes a long way and I am very pleased at how easily it washes off for my clients. I use the Aroma Therapy Oil over the shoulders, chest and stomach so they get the full effect of it. It has a very soothing scent that is not over powering. I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend and I very much like this massage oil.   It has great &#x27;feel&#x27; and its scent is right-on: light, enjoyable, relaxing.   I feel that the cost for this oil is well-priced and I would suggest this   for anyone.</li>
    <li> Works great and smells relaxing</li>
    <li> This is a great massage oil, and has a pleasant lavender scent.  Not sticky or too oily,  great for soothing sore muscles.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This massage lotion was very calming and soothing.  I used it on my hubby and he liked the way it felt on his skin.  I was able to massage a little longer than usual.  Very nice product!!!</li>
    <li> Great body massage oils, my only complaint is that they are a bit oily but it soaks in relatively quickly.</li>
    <li> This massage oil is very nice. It has a nice smell and works in well. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and we really like it. I have it in my wishlist to purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> It smells ok, (i think it&#x27;s a little strong, the wife doesn&#x27;t) but that&#x27;s not really enough to knock a star off it. What I like the most about it is it&#x27;s viscosity and easy clean up. It&#x27;s thick enough that you don&#x27;t need a lot, but it still absorbs well in the end. Also, water cleanup is a breeze. I wash my hands with soap after and there is no greasy feeling left at all. Spill a little on a sheet or blanket and it comes right out in the wash with no signs of staining or discoloration. I tried quite a few oils until I found this one, and I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
    <li> It has a nice, simple smell of lavender and great with skin and touch. I look forward to purchasing more oils from Master Massage in the future.</li>
    <li> This lubricating component is great, great glide, dries with no residue or staining.. nice.  But the smell while pleasant is very strong.  I wish it was only 10% the strength.</li>
    <li> I prefer using KY scented massage oils and this Master Massage Soothing Blend.  I&#x27;ve heard the other scents of master massage aren&#x27;t as good, so I just stick with what works for me.  Soothing Blend MM or Ky Scented oils.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Works great for giving massage at home, wife loves it. The smell is great, I wouldn&#x27;t buy any other scent. I do wish it lasted a little longer, but it seems very natural so I just use a little more and there&#x27;s no issue. You don&#x27;t have to wash it off after use, which is perfect.</li>
    <li> Fantastic massage oil, fun to use, nice aroma, sensual. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using on sheets you don&#x27;t want to ruin, though.</li>
    <li> I already used this oil for massages with my clients and have treated 5 clients so far and the bottle still have plenty left 8/8 full left. The oil can last a while all you need is a small amount and it covers the entire back. I just love it what can I say! Thanks seller!</li>
    <li> Works well, smell is relaxing. Aroma could be a bit stronger though.</li>
    <li> Second time purchasing it . Love it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good, but smells to strong</li>
