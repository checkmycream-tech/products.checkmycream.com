      <li>This particular oil leaves a disagreeable, almost rancid, odor on your skin as well as any garment you wear after using it.  </li>

      <li>I am not an expert but after doing some research I found out that avocado oil should taste slightly nutty while sweet almond oil should have a slight scent.</li>

    <li> If you are looking for sweet almond oil, or any carrier or essential oils, Dr. Adorable oils are of excellent quality and very inexpensive. I use this in a roller bottle mixed with essential oils and it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I like how almond works on ,y skin.</li>
    <li> I make sea salt body scrubs which contain a variety of oils, with sweet almond oil being one of them.  This particular oil leaves a disagreeable, almost rancid, odor on your skin as well as any garment you wear after using it.  It takes days for the odor to dissipate, and stays in the garment indefinitely.  Even after laundering the affected garment(s) several times, the oil odor is still present.  I have not encountered this with other brands of sweet almond oil.  Needless to say, I was not satisfied with this brand of oil and I will not use it in my sea salt scrubs due to the odor it leaves on the skin and garments.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, smoothness, size and the cost. Thank you so much I am still taking it day by day.</li>
    <li> I mix this with salt for a body scrub.  Smells good and makes my skin soft. A lot cheaper than mediocre quality scrubs they sell.</li>
    <li> Was bought for some homemade cream recipes.  Seems to work just fine.  Will be ordering more when I run out</li>
    <li> Everything as promised</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I use this oil in my hair regimen. It moisturizes your hair and your skin. It&#x27;s very affordable and the shipping was very fast too. I will be repurchasing this oil.</li>
    <li> Arrived super fast, well packaged, and the shipper was really nice too. Sent me an e-mail (and responded quickly when I told them I accidentally gave the wrong address). The oil seems to be good quality, and also does not have a smell to it (as a carrier oil shouldn&#x27;t) so this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; oil. Check out essential oils for that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for OCM with some other oils from this guy too. Worked well and came off as easily as you can expect it to. Overall great product and quick shipping (ordered sunday, got it wednesday).</li>
    <li> hey there. I hope this finds everyone well. This is a great carrier oil. It does not smell like sweet almonds. You have to buy sweet I&#x27;m an essential oil and drop a few drops of that into this. And then you will have a wonderful massage oil. I bought this thinking it had a sweet almond smell I did not know this is just a carrier oil. But, Dr.A&#x27;s products are great. I&#x27;ve used evening primrose oil over and over again.</li>
    <li> I ordered two different oils, the avocado oil and the sweet almond oil ( both apparently pure). I am not an expert but after doing some research I found out that avocado oil should taste slightly nutty while sweet almond oil should have a slight scent. However, I received two identical bottles with different labels (one says avocado, the other sweet almond oil) and that is the only way I can identify them. Both oils have no smell or taste at all....that makes me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to order from Dr Adorable inc again simply because I realized that there is no real proof of authenticity and furthermore I dislike that these &#x27;precious&#x27; oils are sent in plastic bottles.</li>
    <li> Really good quality butter! I order from this company a lot because I feel that I&#x27;m purchasing quality. My man&#x27;s father had a really bad case of eczema from Chemotherapy, his skin looked like that of an alligator and he could not find relief to get any sleep. I purchase these butters and made a body butter and in about a week and a half, his skin was totally clear from the dry patches that he had previously suffered from. I was trying to help him sleep, I didn&#x27;t realize that it would clear his skin in this manner. Very high quality oils to mix inside your butters or to just place in your bath water. Thanks to the company for putting such a great product out there.</li>
    <li> always great products</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping and price, not much to say about the product, it&#x27;s Organic Sweet Almond Oil!! Lol. Feels very nice. I bought this for my mom to use because she has rosacea, and I heard this product can really help. I mixed it 30% along with 30%  Grapeseed Oil, and 40% Evening Primrose Oil. Also added a couple drops of Eucalyptus EO, Lavender EO, Clary Sage EO, and Tea Tree EO. This all using the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method) look it up!! :)</li>
    <li> It was a great price and I am very satisfied with it. I use it for my hair and scalp and my hair is looking and feeling great. I just read that it can also help dark circles under your eyes. I just started using it for that...I guess we will see. I see that others have complained about the smell. Mine has no smell...I like that.</li>
    <li> Nice Oil, seems pure and unscented which is how sweet almond oil should be.  If there is a strong scent, most likely it has been altered.  However, am giving it 4 stars because of the packaging.  It was not sealed and it is easy for the oil to come out in quantity (since it is so thin), without a stopper closing top.  Some of the bottles I&#x27;ve used have this feature as to prevent excessive quantity to come out.  So just be careful when pouring; otherwise, great product!</li>
    <li> I recently started making my own moisturizer. Tried various oils, most were too heavy and left me greasy. This almond oil is just right. My skin is soft, and most of all not greasy.</li>
    <li> Exactly what was advertised.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> i use it on my baby as body oil works very good never had diper rash no smell doesnt freeze it means pure oil am hlad i bought it will buy again and recommend to my friends</li>
