<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> fast shipment and as described.  thanks</li>
    <li> I love having wavy hair with this tool! MAkes me feel like a mermaid. I have thick hair, and it makes it easy to style. I usually do my whole head in 30 minutes. and I dont need to use it on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> Was able to use this item maybe 5 times before it randomly stopped working! I have no clue what happened, but it will no longer heat up. I&#x27;ve tried using different plugs throughout the house, but still nothing. I&#x27;m pretty upset about it because I loved the way it waved my hair. Hot Tools is generally a great brand, but maybe my particular one was faulty. Will order another one and hope for the best!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. I bought this for my daughters hair and the waves were too big for her hair. Need something a little smaller.</li>
    <li> Bulls*** item. Mine broke after two months, I&#x27;m NOT happy.&lt;br /&gt;I literally used it a handful of times.</li>
    <li> I would never buy a waver like this one again.  Instead of a nice beachy wave it looked more like a nice 80s crimp.  I am going to try the actual wavers with barrels instead of this version.</li>
    <li> Ok so this has been my holy grail ever since i got it, it makes my hair so pretty and people compliment and ask me how I did my hair and some thought I permed it! As an amateur user of the deep waver Im pretty pleased with all the compliments! the only trouble with this is that i have no way of putting it down, im always afraid its going to burn something if i put it down without it completely cooled. it does get kind of heavy after using it for 5-10 minutes and it gets really hot, but the results are totally worth it! Oh and this deep waver does not give your hair the nasty burnt hair smell at all, i love it.</li>
    <li> Best Hair Waver on the market.  Heats hot and the waves last all day, even on my thick hair.  This is my second purchase of this model, after about 3 years my old one stopped heating. This Hot Tools Waver is also very easy to use!</li>
    <li> Creates awesome waves, the waves resemble finger waves when you use a lot of hair at a time. Or you can use less hair at a time and create a beautiful wavy look. Easy to use, love the lock button because it gives your hands a rest while you style each section. Everyone has been asking me how I styled my hair. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product heats up quickly and delivers the results it promises. I get so many compliments on the looks that I create with this Hot Tools product. I have been a licensed cosmetologist for 10 years and I would recommend this product highly! Just a tip...unless you have extremely course, thick, resilient hair I would keep the temperature between 280 and 320 degrees....your best bet is to keep the temp cooler and hold just a second longer.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Great quality item, works as described and the waves created are perfect!!!!</li>
    <li> Lock &amp; Mane did a great job delivering this item and selling it as described. I was a little bit sketchy about purchasing an item on Amazon because it was my first time doing so. This being said, I e-mailed them to ensure that the item would be new and qualified for free shipping. They responded in a timely manner and they were very understanding and nice about it. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for more. The estimated delivery was about 5-7 days and it arrived in 4 with free shipping! I was very excited to use this product and it&#x27;s great. It heats up fast and it gives out amazing results! My friends were asking how I had such beautiful waves!&lt;br /&gt;I loved it and I absolutely recommend it and Lock &amp; Mane provided me with it with great service and I would definitely buy more from this seller!&lt;br /&gt;Girls, buy this! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes you feel absolutely gorgeous and your hair looks stunning!&lt;br /&gt;So much better than a regular crimmper because this could be used for various different hairstyles. I wouldn&#x27;t think twice of buying it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is quite reasonable for a great product!</li>
    <li> I love this product! The waves it makes on my hair are beautiful and they LAST ALL DAY. Ever since I have started using it I have gotten A LOT of compliments and tons of girls asking me what I am using and where I got it. I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I&#x27;m still getting used to using it the right way. It&#x27;s perfect and works amazingly well!! It&#x27;s very hot, so you will need a heat protection for sure! Worth the price and love this product!</li>
    <li> I did my research before I ordered this product. The reviews on You Tube were pretty good &amp; Hot Tools has a good reputation. Problem is I haven&#x27;t mastered how to use it correctly. Whenever I use the deep waver on my hair it looks crazy, so that&#x27;s the only downfall.</li>
    <li> it makes rather messy waves than orderly, but if thats what you are going for then this is perfect!</li>
    <li> Love this item.  Recevied it quickly</li>
    <li> This is an awesome styling tool - I have thick hair and this created nice, loose waves. Very easy to use and heats up quickly. Super fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> This waver is AWESOME [for long hair, at least]. I LOVED it. So much so that I am REALLY really upset, for it has died after only a few months. Its probably my fault because I left it plugged in and on for a while (no indicator light, just the switch...), before realizing it but I intend to replace it with another or a very similar one either way. I miss it dearly. Highly recommend the purchase.</li>
    <li> I use lots of styling tools on my hair and this one has just become my favorite.  I have thick, course long hair, but this iron gave me perfect waves.  Only took 10 minutes for my whole head!  It gets hot at record speed and stays that way.</li>
    <li> I love the way this waves my hair. This is the best hot tool I currently own. It is a faster alternative to the wand. Don&#x27;t get me wrong the wand is a great hot tool but it takes a little longer than this tool. I know they make 2 different styles but I am one for speed and this one is great.</li>
    <li> I paid full price for this product at my hairdresser&#x27;s ($80) and thought it was worth every penny.  I have stick straight hair that often loses curl by the end of the day but I always dream of soft nice waves.  This gives you that!  I washed and dried my hair, sprayed it with [[ASIN:B00138Y8NI Aquage  Sea Salt Texturizing Spray, 8-Ounce Bottle]] and then used this and followed with a little spray gel.  Absolutely amazing!  My hair held the wave even after getting caught in the rain.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to curl my hair. Even when I&#x27;ve got it done at a salon, the curls always fall flat before I even get where I&#x27;m going. Plus, when I&#x27;ve tried to curl my hair myself I didn&#x27;t know what I was doing and found it very hard to do. I always use a straightener and now I can put a wave into my hair just as easily as I can straighten it. Its easy to use and works good. I still have to use alot of product because my hair is just so limp, but it actually works!! I love this waver!!</li>
    <li> Waves are great and stay in all day but this waver makes my hair smell awful. Like when a new appliance or machine gives off that &amp;#34;heat/burning&amp;#34; smell...it makes my hair smell like that and it doesn&#x27;t go away for about a week.</li>
    <li> The iron heats up fast and is very sturdy and nice, not too heavy.  It works great too!  I have very fine blond straight long hair and it made my hair super full w/no hair spray all day on a very cold rainy day in L.A.! I was amazed how long the waves lasted!</li>
    <li> Gives the hair a pretty good wave, nicer than a triple barrel iron.  looks more like a beachy wave than a curl.  gets very hot very quickly which is good.  But is very large and bulky, makes it hard to handle.  easier to use on someone else than yourself.  takes a few times to get used to...but overall pretty good!</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally curly so I was hoping to get some nice waves with this product. I believe this works best for people with long hair because it&#x27;ll give you that Bohemian/beach-y look. However, my hair is not that long (stops at my breast area) so when I used the product, it didn&#x27;t have that sexiness to it that I was hoping for. It looked cute, but not sexy. Once I grow my hair out, I am confident I will get the results I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have naturally curly hair like I do, I would recommend straightening it a bit before using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did not like about the product was that it tends to get smokey and that can hurt you if you place it close to your scalp. My  Izunami flat iron is usually set to 400 and it doesnt give off smoke so I was shocked to see that this deep waver gave off quite a bit of it and it was only set somewhere in the 300s. I&#x27;m not sure what that&#x27;s about but definitely use something to protect your hair from damaging heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few hours, the deepness of the waves lessened and if that&#x27;s a big deal to you then you would have to do some touch ups after 3 or 4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely use this product again but only if I don&#x27;t plan on being out for too long.</li>
    <li> Harder to use and get the desired look than thought.</li>
    <li> I wish I was able to adjust the size of the waves of this iron.. but it&#x27;s an over all good waver.</li>
    <li> The service was incredible fast... i really did not expected to be delivery really fast and it did. the product came is really good conditions and the product itself is perfect it make me all beautiful waves.</li>
    <li> Love it!! I just wish it would automatically shut off or have a temp reading rather than off and on.  it gets hot and is easy to use!! i love this product!</li>
    <li> It gets very hot sometimes but I do like the waves it gives me</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by this product because it made my hair HUGE &amp; super dry. I usually use a straightener to crimp my hair but saw a Youtube Makeup Guru use it and bought it for my trip to Seattle. I used it the night before and I looked HORRIBLE! Disappointing product.</li>
    <li> Wow...when this arrived I was a little nervous. I thought that the waves would turn out looking unnatural and crimped like 80s hair  but I was wrong! This waver creates natural, beachy waves! I have straight, fine hair and I&#x27;ve never  been able to get such great waves and body. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I must admit I bought this waver thinking it was the same as a 3-barrel curling iron... my mistake! It definitely is more like a large crimper. That being said, it works really well! Heats up fast and HOT. I felt a little like a lion at first, but after a half hour the waves relaxed and I loved my look. The best part was they lasted well into the next day, so I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed to go to breakfast with bed-head.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for 3 ROUND barrels, don&#x27;t buy. But if you want big \\&quot;Z\\&quot; waves (not S, IMO), then this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the design is that it gets pretty hot right where I have to hold my fingers. It doesn&#x27;t burn you or anything, but I&#x27;m surprised they didn&#x27;t fix that.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product- it gives me such beautiful waves. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I wish the product would get hotter and also because sometimes my hais is still frizzy after I use it. I find that hairspray before and after help keeps the wave minus most of the frizz. I have naturally curly/wavy hair that is medium in texture; this product gives GREAT volume and I am ALWAYS getting compliments when I have used it. Its so easy to use (the HOt Tools website says hold for 5 seconds) and sometimes bec of my naturally wavy hair- whan Im in a rush Ill just do the top layer of my hair. This tool is easier to use than blowing hair straight and the look is sexier and fuller.</li>
    <li> Works great especially on my daughter&#x27;s really thick hair. The waves stayed in place even after sleeping on them overnight.</li>
    <li> I just purchased this waver and am so glad I did!  The waver is very easy and quick to use. My hair is just below my shoulders and it took me less than 10 minutes to wave it all.  It creates the big S-waves I have been trying unsuccessfully to do with other styling tools.  I love that it heats up quickly and you can adjust the temperature.  You can also lock it closed so it is easier to store.</li>
    <li> Great tool that heats up really quickly, with adjustable heat setting. Easy to use, just like handling a straightner but a little chunkier. Very pleased with results, creates large waves.</li>
    <li> Not made for fine shorter hair.  Couldn&#x27;t get the ends of my hair to wave under.  A 3 barrel works much better.&lt;br /&gt;*Keep in mind if you don&#x27;t like it and want to return it they charge you a 15% restocking fee*  If I would&#x27;ve known that I would never have bought it. I will pay better attention next time I buy.</li>
    <li> I have very naturally healthy and shiny, very straight dark hair, like that of the Native Amercans. My hair holds a curl very well. I already owned 2 different kinds of ceramic wavers and was looking for a more natural and less kinky kind of wave. This waver is ok, but not really what I expected. In my opinion it is not much different than the other wavers that are not described as DEEP wavers. I do hold Hot Tools brand in high regard from owning their products for numerous years. I would definitely take this deep waver over the other regular wavers, but wish I wouldn&#x27;t have invested more money into the same kind of thing, more or less. I also do not like the dial adjustment used to set the temp on this because it is loose and changes on its own. I taped mine down so that it wouldn&#x27;t accidentally set to a higher temp and burn my hair. Hope this is helpful.</li>
    <li> I used to own the Revlon one but it broke so I tried ordering another but it doesn&#x27;t deliver to where I live so I ordered this one and I don&#x27;t regret it does exactly what I want nice wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this waver. It heats up and cools down pretty quick, delivers natural looking deep waves, and when your done waving and the waver is cool the plates interlock for easy storage.</li>
    <li> this heats up really quickly and really hot. i did my whole head of hair (long &amp; thick hair) in less than 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I just recently purchased this tool. I saw it being used on a girl in a youtube video and her hair turned out wonderful. When I got it, I turned it on and the whole thing gets so hot. there almost is no place to place your fingers when you have it clamped down. i was using a hot pad. :-/  its kinda akward to use but once you get the hang of it and get past how hot the tool gets my hair was nice. and i do use it every other weekend.</li>
    <li> This item was a gift, however she and her sister both love it. Her older sister and older sister&#x27;s friends claim it&#x27;s the best waiver they have ever used., I&#x27;m now considering buying one for myself.</li>
    <li> OMG I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;my hair is so hard to curl/wave but this did the trick!&lt;br /&gt;The waves came out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair style definitely takes some time to accomplish..curling wand curls are much faster but if you have the patience the end style is beautiful...especially if you have dull straight hair like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the product is that there is no light indicating that the waver is on, there is a on/off switch, but I just like lights telling me it&#x27;s on and HOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT! VERY HAPPY GIRL HERE!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review the product per se as it was a gift for my Daughter. But... I have heard no complaints so it must be no less than great. If you knew her you would know what I mean. Lighting speed on the transaction though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item (not through Amazon) at a big beauty chain store.  I was inspired to use it after discovering a YouTube video about this product.  The results in my hair were fantastic.  I have long, thick hair and it created beautiful deep waves.  My only problem with this waver is that it only lasted three weeks.  The thing just died on me.  No heat at all one morning while getting ready to use it.  I unplugged it, turned the dial to different heat settings, used different outlets throughout house, etc., to no avail.  It was dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, it was still returnable at the store I purchased it from (under 30 days).  I guess I lucked out and didn&#x27;t purchase this through the mail.  So, it was easy for me to return it to the store for a refund.  I&#x27;ve now got a TIGI Deep Waver on order as a replacement.  I don&#x27;t trust Hot Tools anymore.  The clerk at the store I bought it from said to me \\&quot;It&#x27;s a Hot Tool.  They break all the time\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So beware, if you buy this waver... love it while it works, but don&#x27;t depend on it for very long.  Be sure to save your receipts and register the product with the manufacturer to obtain the warranty.  For those out there that bought their&#x27;s months ago and it still works, consider yourself lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to love this product, but I just can&#x27;t recommend it due to the many complaints of quick failure.</li>
    <li> 2nd time using it and it melted and fell apart.  Unable to return as it is beyond 30 days.</li>
    <li> I looked through a ton of different wavers, three-barrel and like this style, and finally decided on this one after reading all of the positive reviews. I was nervous to try it because I thought it would take 3 hours to use like a regular curling iron. However, this is so easy! It took me probably 20 minutes my first time using it and I have fairly long hair. I like to use it with bigger chunks of hair (and holding it shut a little longer) so that I get bigger waves. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants wavy hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it held for a really long time. My hair almost never holds curl for more than an hour, and this managed to hold the curl over 2 nights. Granted, my hair was pretty greasy looking by the 2nd morning, but I was still surprised that 2 nights of sleeping on it didn&#x27;t make it lose the curl. Definitely use a heat protecting spray (I recommend the CHI version) to keep your hair from frying.</li>
    <li> This crimper does what it is advertised to do.  I like the adjustable heat setting.  The price was very good.  As with all my purchases via Amazon, it arrived quickly.  It takes a long time to do all my hair which is quite long.  Takes practice and patience to get the best look.  Can&#x27;t crimp too much hair at once - about 1 inch sections is best.  If I could take my head off, it would be great.  But as not the case, it takes quite a bit of manipulation to do it all.  If you have long hair (shoulder or longer) plan on at least 45 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have very, VERY thick but fine hair. That in and of itself creates a great deal of problems when it comes to curling irons, flatteners, wavers, crimpers, blow dryers, etc.  Unfortunately, the Hot Tools Deep Waver with pulse technology fails to curl my hair like a great deal of others. It works fine on other people&#x27;s hair, which I tried it on, but not mine. That&#x27;s why the 4 stars instead of 5. It&#x27;s average at best. It gets hot and waves most people&#x27;s hair and behaves just like the description says, just doesn&#x27;t wave my hair.</li>
    <li> 100% delivery time and product</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I have strait hair and I always want to curl my hair, but everytime I do, it takes like 2 hours (I have VERY long hair) and my hair never holds curls, so I thought I would give this product a try since I wanted something different than strait. Well, may I say this was exactly what I needed. My hair is 34 inches long and it took about 45 minutes the first time, and 30 every time after&gt; (from dry hair). The first time I styled after my nightly shower and I put hair spray in because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would hold, but by morning, it was still perfect. I woke up the next day and it was a little frizzy but I did wear it through the day and still got several compliments. The second time I styled it was after a morning shower and It stayed great all day and the next day before a shower was necessary. DO NOT BRUSH IT!!! after you crimp, hair spray or not, you should  not brush it because it will become like an afro. This product is very hot, and because of that a heat protectant in VITAL and this product IS NOT FOR CHILDREN. I use a tresseme heat protectant, but any should be fine. I recieved soooo many compliements and was even asked by several if I had fake hair on because it was so beautiful. Also this hair style is cute with half down and the top half in a messy bun. Very cute!!! Good luck and use heat protectant!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have bought in a while! I have fine straight hair, and this makes my hair curly and adds a lot of volume. I have never received so many compliements on my hair before. It really gives you those big beautiful \\&quot;beachy\\&quot; type waves that I have never been able to get from a standard curling iron, or even the old school rollers.</li>
    <li> I have this item for a week now and I absolutley love it! I tried it on my hair after it was straightened and it adds great volume; i tried it on my naturally curly hair (damp) and it looks great too! I have a feeling I will be using this item on an almost daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;i was skeptical before i bought it because i didnt know what to expect but I had heard amazing things; I took a chance and ordered it and it was well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I am now considering buying the hair products that are recommended to go along with it.</li>
    <li> I tried this waver this morning for the first time and I thought it did a great job. First of all, I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s down to the middle of my back length. My advice is take big chunks of hair otherwise it will end up looking to crimpy looking 80&#x27;s hair. Also a word of caution, if you have a lot of hair like me, you might end up looking like you have even more hair.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, definitely use a heat protector spray like CHI and don&#x27;t use the waver on the highest heat setting. I did mine on 380. It took me 15 minutes to do my whole head which is not bad for me.</li>
    <li> I just bought this a couple weeks ago. I&#x27;ve used it maybe five times and loved the way my hair turned out. While using it today it stopped working in the middle of doing my hair.  I tried plugging it into other outlets thinking that was the problem, it wasn&#x27;t. I use it on the lowest setting  so it&#x27;s not like it could have burned out. Needless to say I&#x27;m beyond pissed right now.</li>
    <li> I Have always been wanting that Beachy Mermaid Hair look, and this Waver is perfect, I get lots of compliments on my hair and people love it,.</li>
    <li> I would recommend. She loves it, easy to use, nice features, great results. It was a great gift at a nice price.</li>
    <li> It is very bad just work as heater no shape or wave to the hair , I put it on the junk&lt;br /&gt;not worth to return it from my home to usa</li>
    <li> i absoultly loved it !&lt;br /&gt;its very natural and sexy !&lt;br /&gt;gives vloume texture !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;333333</li>
    <li> Very pleased w/this purchase....goes great on my natural curly hair, very cute!</li>
    <li> It works really well and I love the effect on my hair.  But the handle gets really hot.  Too hot to hold sometimes.</li>
    <li> I bought the hot tool deep wave 1 month ago and i love it so much. It makes real big waves on my hair. It works so well. I even got good compliment about my new hair! love it!</li>
    <li> it does make your hair crimpy but the crimper started smoking and smeling the minute i pluged it.i did my whole head with a smoking iron .i think the smoke was comming from the front of the barrel because it does get very hot and they have a little plastic thing to sport it which is burning and the plastic is smelling and smoking.i used the iron 4 times it hasn&#x27;t smoking yet.</li>
    <li> I have yet to find one better than this, does a nice wave but not recommended for shorter hair(less than shoulder length) LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> it was great until it broke.  It worked for about 5 months.</li>
    <li> Randomly stopped working after only about 5 uses!!!  Was given as a xmas gift, and less than 2 months later, and very, very few uses - does nothing at all when it gets plugged in!!  Worked great when it worked.</li>
    <li> Excellent!  Came quickly and was packaged very well thank you</li>
    <li> I must say i have extremely thick hair and this waver heats my hair perfectly! you can adjust the heat to your hair thickness. The waves are very defined, i highly recommend this waver :)</li>
    <li> I prefer the three barrel waver I got from Hot Tools.  This waver didn&#x27;t seem to give me much curl or wave at all.</li>
    <li> The most amazing product I have ever used and leaves good result. It get really hot so be careful but other then that I give it two thumb up.....</li>
    <li> This item is great. The first time I used it, I had to look up directions on youtube and after that it worked really well on my hair. Just have to be more careful than a regular curling iron because of its width, but other than that, works like a charm for wavy, sexy hair</li>
    <li> I love this tool, unfortunately its my second one because the first one lasted just over a year, BUT i didn&#x27;t want to be without it. The waves look really fab  and its easy to use, just take a small amount of hair at a time for maximum wave impact.</li>
    <li> The effect this styling tool gives is great. You can create those pretty wavy/curly textures that many wear in the summer. Although it does what it promises ( creates waves) it also creates heat damage! It gets very hot, even with a heat Protectant it burned my hair over time. You have to be very careful with this tool so buyer be ware!</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron in October because friends of mine have one and love it. I used this tool ordered through Amazon 4 times only then it quit working won&#x27;t get hot at all. :( and now find out I can only send it back for 1/2 of what I paid plus shipping is on me. its not even 90 days old and like I mentioned used 4 TIMES ONLY.....</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Deep waiver, does its job fast and it last</li>
    <li> Love Love Love!! My hair looks awesome when I use this product!!! Highly recommend!!!! Excellent price!! Definitely buy from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> The best thing I have ever bought for my straight hair! I use it often and people literally stop me to say they love my hair. It makes me feel like I have a ton! Yay me! :)</li>
    <li> I do have amazon prime but the shipping was really fast about a day! I got the wave last week so I have only used it once but I can say it heats up very fast and it looks and feels like very good quality. I was undecided between this and the bedhead and actually went to ulta and saw them in person and this waver is much better quality. I found it easy to use and got complements all day. I love it definitely.</li>
    <li> Truly gives me pretty waves, people ask if it&#x27;s natural. It&#x27;s so easy and quick to do also, it takes the same amount of time to straighten my hair (which I normally do every morning). It gets hot super fast, but be careful, because the outside is just as hot as the inside where your hair touches. It&#x27;s not like a straightener with protective covering outside the hot plates (I learned this the hard *STUPID* way!)</li>
    <li> This waver is perfect for people with long hair looking for a quick way to get those pretty S-waves usually seen in fashion mags. One word of advice for non-ethnic and ethnic girls alike - use a heat protectant on completely dry hair prior to using this iron. It gets hot - really hot - and could easily burn your hair and destroy your cuticle...Also, make sure you divide your hair into large sections to ensure that \\&quot;Veronica Lake\\&quot; deep wave. YouTube has some great videos of people demo-ing this waver and I strongly suggest you watch them prior to purchasing it. All in all, a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this deep waver, I use it a couple times a week. It works really well and it&#x27;s affordable! I was torn between the hot tools deep waver and the bed head deep waver but so far I am happy with my choice, I think they are basically the same exact thing.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product because i want to do something different with my hair. When i received it i opened it right away and turned it on full heat because i know my hair is so hard to curl so it heated up really fast and it was very HOT so i sectioned out my hair and began to crimp. It had this weird smell to it as i was crimping my hair and there was so much steam coming out of my hair that my whole room was smokey so i finished all my hair and it was fantastic it turned out really nice i got alot of compliments and the curls lasted 2 days. After the second day i went to wash my hair out and it still smelled burned? i washed my hair 3 times and let the shampoo and conditioner sit in my hair and it still smelled burned.? The next morning i washed it again and the smell started to go away. I&#x27;m not sure why it smelled burned  ? maybe the heat was to high! Has anyone had this problem?</li>
    <li> I have very straight hair. I have impossible hair, it won&#x27;t even curl with over-night curlers. A nice curling iron will work if I spray pounds of Aqua Net in my hair, but that takes TIME. My hair is to the middle of my back and thick, this tool worked great. If you have hair like me you are looking at about 45minutes, but it stays great throughout the day without any hairspray!! Highly recommended if you are looking to make your hair more exciting!&#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have naturally curly hair, but this didn&#x27;t add a wave to my hair, it made it look more crimped and frizzy. I would let my hair air dry or I&#x27;d atleast blow dry it and then use this so I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s part of the problem, but I don&#x27;t have the time to blow dry, straighten and then wave. That might&#x27;ve worked, but I was lucky I had enough time to do this step, let alone 3 steps to get it looking perfect. Maybe this is much better for people with naturally straight hair, but for me it went back.</li>
    <li> This deep waver gives great waves, but I am unsure of the quality and durability of the product. For one the black coating on the hot plates are chiipping more and more with use. Also it is impossible to hold this item on the designated grip...IT GETS WAY TO HOT! I have to use a hot glove in order to use this item. I&#x27;ll do an update soon, until then it works great...it&#x27;s just uncomfortable to use and the quality and lasting power is questionable.</li>
    <li> This deep waver is awesome.  You can create alot of different styles with it.  You can get a set of full waves on lifeless hair.  It heats up quickly and best, you can set the temperature for up to 430 degrees.  The only negative thing about this waver is that it seems to release smoke when you set it up to 430 degrees.  Probably because of the high heat.  But other than that, it is a fantastic tool.</li>
    <li> Hot tools is a fitting name. The waver heats up quickly and stays consistently hot when styling. The waver gives you those perfect beach waves you&#x27;ve always wanted. I&#x27;m a big fan of Connie Britton and her hair and when I saw this tool I knew it could recreate her style and it did. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of completes on my hair whenever I use it and the ceramic plates leave my hair softer than before I used it. It takes a little finesse to know how to use the waver, but anyone who curls or blow dries their hair regularly can get the hang of using the waver quickly. It worked on my naturally wavy/curly, medium consistency hair as well as on my sister who has naturally straight, horse-hair thick hair with the exact same results.</li>
    <li> I love it! Gets hot quickly and creates big waves. However, it is pretty heavy so that can get annoying when your trying to wave your whole head. Other than that it&#x27;s great and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do product reviews, but after reading so many and having such great results,  I felt it was needed. I did my research before buying a deep waver and I am thrilled with this product!  Heats up fast, stays hot....I have never burnt myself because I am an adult and understand how to use hot tools near my head and face.  I read the directions *gasp* and started with the heat setting suggested by Hot Tools.  I stay within the suggested range ( a lil under actually) and my hair doesn&#x27;t smell burnt or has burnt off (not sure how people do that....start low folks)  Takes me about 30 mins to complete my whole head....i have hair that is thick and to the top of the bra line.  I get loads of volume and compliments and have suggested this product to anyone who asks.  I also played around with which way I hold the waver, and ultimately,  use it the way that works for you.</li>
    <li> As a previous review stated the waver gets too hot and it becomes difficult to hold the waver properly. My hand began to hurt after awhile and I would have to take short breaks. Whoever created this product missed the bar on certain factors. Finger placement to clamp down the waver is located in an area where the product becomes too hot, it is uncomfortable and I suggest you find another waver. I chose this waver because I wanted to try it out and it was relatively cheap. Its was not worth the money, I&#x27;d rather curl my hair.</li>
    <li> In all my 63 years my hair has never held a wave or curl in it for more than a couple of hours! Finally this waver will hold waves in my straight hair for three or more days with a little mousse and spritz in it! I have no trouble with burnt hair at the 350 degree setting and I love this waver!!!!</li>
    <li> This was my 1st time purchase this product from overseas,i was really satisfied of the quality and still in brand new,and i receive it more early than i expected and the packaging is really safe and good in conditions.I like this product more than others as it has the deep waves that gives me the results that i wanted compare to the others brand,as this product not selling in Malaysia too,this hot tools gets hit up easily might as well kinda heavy for me if i do my hair for longer time if its too much of hair or too long LOL,hands get shaky hot and heavy if holding it longer!!But this product needs a international charger or plug also.Overall i can say is that im satisfied for the delivery package and product also,and im happy using it as well HAHAHA....</li>
    <li> So now I know how the salons get these wonderful waves!&lt;br /&gt;I love this machine...it is absolutely amazing. I did alot of research between the hot tools hair deep waver vs the 3 barrel crimper and I am glad I chose this!&lt;br /&gt;Instantly, without any hair product in my hair, the waver started adding very defined waves into my hair! and they actually stay for quite some time! Of course, with spray and mousse, I am sure they would hold for more than a day.&lt;br /&gt;Do not hesitate to buy this product!&lt;br /&gt;You definitely need a heat mat while using this product as it heats from both sides.</li>
    <li> Umm.. The outcome is good, but every time we use it feels like its burning our hair! It even leaves a smell of burn!</li>
    <li> I tried it more then once and it just makes my hair really frizzy! There is also no side that u can put it down on so u havta hold it the whole time.</li>
    <li> Love it! Bought about 8 minths ago. The size of the waves are realistic and gorgeous. I can do my entire head of medium length thick hair in 20 mins. I use a tiny bit of hair spray and the waves easily last all day. Heats up instantly and I haven&#x27;t burned myself yet.</li>
    <li> Item was spoilt after 2 use. worst quality and life spend product. won&#x27;t recommend to even buy at all. money wasted</li>
    <li> i bought this item about a month ago and loved it, i used it about 6 times and i was using it yesterday and got half way done with my hair and it just stopped working out of no where. it no longer heats up, iv tried every outlet and every plug... beyond angry!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of deep waver research before I made this purchase. I watched all the YouTube videos (deep waver 1 vs deep waver 2, etc) and everyone said this was the best. It works very well as far as deep wavers go. I only used it a couple times because it turns out the style just wasn&#x27;t for me. But if you know what you want is deep waves and you&#x27;re definitely going to get one, this is the one to get. I have very thick hair and a lot of it, and the waves held all day. Seller shipped fast, product as described. I say go for it!</li>
    <li> i just received my hot tools deep waver today and i was soo thrilled, i was expecting to receive it sometime next week. So right when i got it i drove to target to buy a heat protectant then i returned quickly to try out my product. I had read a lot of good reviews about the product so i was finally going to try it out for myself. I was so excited but kept thinking inside maybe its too good to be true.So i went ahead and started \\&quot;waving\\&quot; my hair keeping that in mind and once i was done my conclusion was that i LOVED it!! Iam so happy i ordered from Cyberteams Inc. I recommend them to everyone. Thank you Cyberteams Inc!</li>
    <li> Makes beautiful deep waves.I use it alot with heat protection.You will love the deep waves and become addicted to them.</li>
    <li> This waver is amazing. Once my hair was dry I was able to style it quickly in less than 10 minutes (I have medium-length hair). I could have taken longer, but 10 minutes made my hair look pretty darn cool. I also love the cord, which is round instead of flat and I don&#x27;t see it getting tangled as easily as other cords. This baby does get hot, but that&#x27;s a good thing, I&#x27;d probably just make sure to use some heat-protectant on your hair first. Overall, I&#x27;m inlove with this thing and it seems very well built so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
    <li> This product works so well and is an extremely great value. Creates loose and beach-y waves quickly and easily. No need to linger too long on the hair to get good results. I have thin hair that is down to the middle of my back and I was able to do my entire head in until 20 minutes. The waves last for the entire day even without hair products.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!!! I absolutely love it. Its heats really quickly. I have alot of thick hair and I was able to style in 30 min. I usually just flat iron my hair and go but this waver gives my hair a little something extra. I don&#x27;t even have to use the highest heat setting of 430 to get the results I need. I have absolutely no complaints about this item except I wish I would have had it sooner.</li>
    <li> Works just like it says. Have had for over a year and works just like new. Love it! Thanks A lot!</li>
    <li> The reviews about how great this iron works are accurate, and so are the ones that say IT BREAKS WITH MINIMAL USE!  This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She was so excited about how well it worked until 1 1/2 months later when, just as these reviews warned, it stopped working!  I&#x27;m contacting the seller.  This is wrong.</li>
    <li> I really like this waver. It leaves really nice cool waves on the hair. I got many compliments on my hair after using this product.</li>
    <li> Unlike other wavers I have tried, the Hot Tools 2179 Deep Waver actually makes deep defined waves that will last.  I suggested using a setting spray before and after using the waver so the waves set in place even longer.  It will leave a deep zig-zag pattern, not just a \\&quot;S\\&quot; shaped like curls.  I am Latina and my hair is thick and long.  I start by parting around the crown of my head and work with 3 inch strips of hair. Spray a small amount setting spray such as hair spray or freezing mist and begin about 2\\&quot; away from my scalp.  Hold the waver in place for 8 to 10 seconds.  Let it open and slide it down the same strip of hair and repeat until I reach the end. I love using products that are ceramic and tourmaline because they use far-infrared heat to protect your hair from intense heat and produces negative ions to smooth and increase the shine in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beast does heat up to 430 degrees so be careful when holding it close to your face.  Comes with a nice long 8 foot cord and an on and off switch.  The only negative thing I can say about it is I wish it had some kind of light that would let me know it was on.  However I still rate it 5 stars because it leaves my hair looking like it was done professionally!</li>
    <li> If you use this, start at least halfway down your hair or you will look like a poodle. I have long thick hair. I much prefer a curl to a wave I discovered thanks to this. Back to hot rollers for me.</li>
    <li> I have really, really straight hair that would never hold a curl and I used this yesterday for the first time. It held the wave great all day and was still there in the morning, I just plugged it back in and freshened them up!&lt;br /&gt;Here is a pic:&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried another brand of the deep waver, Q something, bought at Sally&#x27;s on clearance. It smoked and burnt the crap out of my hair. The hot tools deep waver was nothing like that, A little steam at first, but definitely not the damaging affect the previous deep waver produced. Beautiful deep waves, very different from the average just straight or curly. The only issue I have with a deep waver in General is that if you touch or tousle your hair after using the tool, it gets very frizzy! Definitely don&#x27;t suggest finger brushing the waves once they are done. But love the look!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything!  I don&#x27;t have much hair but with this product I totally feel more confident!  ;)</li>
    <li> not much to say, this thing is great. I got bored of my flat ironed hair and used this deep waver. My hair looked great and the waves lasted w/o having to use hair spray. Very easy to use, just don&#x27;t forget to use heat protection spray!</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair which can frizz up and be quite stubborn sometimes. I don&#x27;t use this directly after taking a shower. I will use it the day after I wash and straighten my hair. It works great!!</li>
    <li> I have stick-straight hair. With this deep waver, and plenty of Aussie Insta-Freeze (thanks for the tip, Duggar girls!), a get &#x27;40s movie-star waves. The secret is to flip your hair upside-down after it&#x27;s cooled and comb your fingers through it to &amp;#34;fluff.&amp;#34; My daughter said I look like Ariel from Little Mermaid!</li>
    <li> I love this waver...it is quick and easy to use! It also stays very well i can sleep and my hair will still have waves in the morning</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron! The curls are deep and stay all day. I have shoulder length hair and it is perfect for the length. I had to practice a bit to keep a crimp from forming on the leading edge of the iron, but if you just turn it a little so the hair doesn&#x27;t hit the edge it works great.&lt;br /&gt;One big draw back is there is no light to indicate whether it is on or not. Left it on twice so far, thank goodness for those silicone mats!&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise love it!</li>
    <li> I love this deep V waver. It heats up quickly and is easy to use! You will love this tool!</li>
    <li> I love this deep waver, it really is deeper than most others that are on the market. I use this on my 9 and 1 year old all the time. The love is and are always getting compliments, fast and easy to use too!</li>
    <li> LOVE this. Ordered it, it came the exact delivery date and it works great.</li>
    <li> Works great especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This made beautiful waves in my hair! I let my hairdresser do it for me though ... I&#x27;m sure it would have still looked great if I did it myself :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this waver for several months now and it still works great!  It heats up well and is easy to use.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in changing their life.</li>
    <li> Love it!  Always get compliments on my hair when I use this!</li>
    <li> Great Product!!this is an excellent product very well recommended if you want to make a gift to your wife!! she will love it!!</li>
    <li> Just what we needed to have and at a very great price. Definitely recommend this to all of you looking for this.</li>
    <li> I usually braid my hair over night to achieve curls. My hairdresser suggested this item to me, for times when I don&#x27;t have the time to let my hair dry over night. It works great. The curls are (fairly) quickly made and turn out very nice. Definitely recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I do not understand how anyone could like this waver!  I have very easy to manage hair, straight &amp; halfway down my back, curls/waves/straightens easily.  This item smells TERRIBLE...I thought an electrical fire might happen.  After doing 2 strands, my hair looked like an 80&#x27;s crimp.  Not wavy, not sexy, CRIMPY.  It still smells an hour later too (the hair I mean).  Save your money &amp; buy a curling iron or wave with a straightener.</li>
    <li> I HAVE REALLY LONG HAIR ALMOST TO MY PANT LINE, I can finish my hair in 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;can have realy loose waves or supper wavy depending on the heat I pick! I would deff recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> It does what it suppose to do wave your have and it looks good! But it gets hot all over and it&#x27;s easy to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> Great product! I use it almost everyday. It is easy, stylish, and I can do my hair in about 10 minutes! Shipping was super fast, too.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and was looking for a deeper waver to get my hair done fast. This not only gets your hair done fast but it stays so HOT! That&#x27;s a good thing and then a bad thing too I guess. I love the way my hair looks and would re-purchase!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! Quick delivery and great product. Makes me feel tropical when I do my hair with this product.</li>
    <li> i love it!!!! it works exactly how i wanted it to work!!!</li>
    <li> Heavy!!! And not only that, after two months of use, it just stopped working.  And it burned my fingers. Be careful.</li>
    <li> Used 15 times and then quit working.</li>
    <li> AMAZON Prime made this a plus on my order.  I got it the next day, the seller must have put it in the mail the day I ordered it, I found it the next afternoon, right at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it &amp;#34;controls&amp;#34; my odd &amp;#34;half and half&amp;#34; hair.  Curly on the bottom of my head, straight on the crown, and this made my hair do &amp;#34;even&amp;#34; during the summer months, plus gives me so much body.  We live near the beach, and it makes me look like I just came in from a swim.  Easy and fast, this temperature control puts you in control of how your hair looks, and behaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I noticed, I can do my &#x27;do like they are doing the &#x27;do&#x27;s on most of the TV Shows I watch, just by putting it at an angle and, I get compliments, and lots of questions on &amp;#34;how did you do that&amp;#34; ... Credit where credit is due.  Great Seller, great product, and I think when the humidity goes away as winter approaches, this will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; seller for any new straighteners, or curing irons.</li>
    <li> The tool worked exactly as advertised. It was easy to use and gave beautiful soft curls. I would buy this product again. The great price  I got from amazon was awesome too !&#x27;</li>
    <li> I tend to ignore the more negative reviews of products if there aren&#x27;t very many, as with this product. I tend to have good luck with most things I order as long as I do the proper research. I compared this product with many similar irons before deciding on this specific one. I used it one morning and it took only about 20-25 minutes to complete my head of long hair. The results were gorgeous, shiny, S waves, just as described. However, it left my hair with a burnt-rubber smell that lasted for about a week after I used the iron. When I used this, I got numerous compliments on my hair and many people asked what I used to achieve the look. I am sad to say that I regret recommending this product to so many people, as the next time I intended to use it, it simply wouldn&#x27;t work. I tried every outlet, and the iron just wouldn&#x27;t heat up. Keep in mind this was after ONE completely normal use. It had never gotten wet, never been dropped, never been plugged in for an extended period of time. This is the first, and last product I will ever buy from Hot Tools. I am returning this product.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use this. As soon as I opened it, unlocked it and turned it on, I waited about 30 seconds and it just totally melted the plates off! I didn&#x27;t even have it on a high setting. As soon as I picked it up, the plates fell off!!!</li>
    <li> great waves! I read great reviews on this product and was debating to save money and get this or splurge for something like the CHI. Since this one received good reviews, I went for the less expensive option, and I am glad I did. I have thick, coarse hair, so it works great on the highest setting and doesn&#x27;t take very long to do entire hair.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair look like angel hair-- if there is such a thing. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it gives a feminine look and it heats up super fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greetings from beautiful Armenia.</li>
    <li> Mine also quit working after only using for a couple of months...bummer, this is the second time for me. I will have to look for a large 3 barrel instead.</li>
    <li> i cant say i found anything bad with this waver!!! totally awesome!!! i bought it cuz i saw some ppl talk about it on YouTube. but i never thought it would turn out this great!!!&lt;br /&gt;the waves stay for a long time!!! it arrived so quickly, it&#x27;s so easy to use!!! i totally recommend it for any girl!!!</li>
    <li> This iron is slightly bulky but it really does produce beautiful beachy waves (think mermaid hair). It heats up very fast ( heats up to 430 degrees) and has a latch that keeps the plates together which is nice if packing for a trip. I wish it could be made less bulky but overall I like it and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have long hair and have used this many times.  It is quick and easy and is easier and less time consuming than using hot rollers.  I have very straight hard to curl hair and am very happy with this product.  I also gave one to my daughters fro Christmas and they enjoy it very much also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair/makeup artist and clearly I&#x27;m particular about items. This waver is fantastic.  Very impressed.  Lightweight and waves perfectly.  Very quick, esp compared to others I have. You only have to leave on hair a few seconds and it&#x27;s a big beautiful beach wave.  Totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I honestly love this deep waver , it works amazing. It heats up fast and stays hot. it works on long hair and thick hair . the only thing i would suggest is put on heat protect-ant before use because it can get really hot. its a little heavy but it works.</li>
    <li> Makes gorgeous waves that last till you wash it which was nice since curls never last in my straight hair.  But even the lowest heat setting burns your hair.</li>
    <li> This things rocks.  I have such straight hair and in these years with perms out of sytle I have been so bored with the same straight hair everyday.  With this item, I can go curly one day and straight the next with very little work and really natural looking results.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re not familiar with how to use this wave tool, you could end up looking like you have a bad perm. Otherwise, excellent for creating volume in fine hair or just for change of style.</li>
    <li> Great product, very easy to use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this waver! It gives you nice mermaid, beachy waves!</li>
    <li> I loved this waver and used it for two weeks straight before it completely stopped working. I had it warming up and made some lunch and when I got back to it, it was dead. I thought maybe it had an auto shut off but NO! I tried different outlets and turned it on and off hoping to reset it but it was gone. Thankfully, since it died so quickly I was still able to return it through Amazon. I&#x27;m now hoping the Bedhead brand gives me better luck because I loved the waver!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this waver.  It makes my hair look and feel really nice. Plus the waves lasts for days.</li>
    <li> Love this deep waver. It works PERFECTLY. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, doesn&#x27;t ruin my hair at all. Get nothing but compliments when I do use it. c:</li>
    <li> I love the deep waver, gives you an easy style fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I do not like is that if you are not careful, you can easily burn yourself since it is so bulky.</li>
    <li> Works really good. The curls lasted until you wash you hair. Received this item promptly as promised. Just in time for a school dance.</li>
    <li> I did not know what to expect with this tool as there are higher end brands. This tool gets very hot and I only have to hold it on my hair for 3 seconds for great results. My husband complements me all the time when I do my hair with this tool.</li>
    <li> If I took more time to do my hair each morning, this would be a great tool.  I&#x27;m just too lazy!</li>
    <li> Works great in my daughter&#x27;s thin hair. Keeps the wave all day and she is in elementary school! Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Not so good for thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair that looks GREAT on the underside, and fluffy-frizzy on the top.  This Deep Waver is great for quickly making the top of my hair look great (and, of course, the rest if I so desire!).  The look is very natural, beachy, and holds very well.  The waves last me two days before starting to go a little limp.  Waving my hold head of hair (medium thickness, long), takes about 15 minutes.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I was very happy with this waver it works great &amp; easy to handle i use it all the time</li>
    <li> This product does get HOT, took a couple of times using it to train myself on how to use it without burning myself, lol. I love it though, must faster and higher quality product that other wavers I have used.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and gives hair a fun great wave look. Just be careful it gets very hot!  Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deep waver! I have fine, straight shoulder length hair that hardly holds a curl. I have used this already several times and it literally will hold the wave for days(I do spray a light hairspray on after to improve the look and help it hold). It&#x27;s a very natural wave too-every time I use it, people ask me if my hair is naturally wavy. The waver is easy and quick to use.  It looks good on different types of hair. I used it on my step-daughter who has very thick, long curly hair and it looked great on her! I would really recommend this product! It&#x27;s a wonderful change from the flat iron or curling iron!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this waver.  My daughter has fine hair but you would never know it once it is waved!  It turns out so dang cute and she really likes it.  I love that it comes with different heat settings so I don&#x27;t burn her 4 year old hair.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my step daughter over a year ago and she&#x27;s still using it.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my Revlon Double Barrel curler broke. I heard that there was a big difference between this waver and the curler. I can say that the waves are \\&quot;tighter\\&quot; than a double barrel but I absolutely love the outcome of this product as does my husband. The only issue I have is the handle does heat up pretty hot but get some gloves and you will be fine. The cord is long and the waver heats up extremely fast and gets very hot. The waves stay in until I wash them out. It is definitly worth the money! If it wasn&#x27;t for the handle getting so hot it would definitly be a 5 star product!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews about products, but I&#x27;m so thrilled with the results that i wanted to write one! It&#x27;s amazing, I have very long, straight hair that is hard to curl but with Deep Waver it makes s waves that look like I have curly hair. I have tried with a lot of curling irons, flat irons etc to get to this point. I just recommend this to any woman who is looking for beach type waves.  It is going to keep the same shape for 1 day or even 2 days which is pretty wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have never used anything like this before, so it was very new to me. My hair is very corse and straight, especially the bottom layers. And this did a fantastic job keeping them wavy. The Deep Waver heated quickly, and stayed hot till I was done with it. My only dissapointment was it left my hair kind of frizzy. So I recomend a smoothing serum for something of the sort to prevent this.</li>
    <li> I ordered this along with another one and I love both! This one is great because it heats up really hot for my thick hair! Waves turn out great, just takes some practice.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on my hair and I loved it so much I had to have one of my own. My hair is thick, but very fine. This gives me so much body! The best part is it looks great on day 2 as well. It is a very beachy, natural wave. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> does great waves, I  would recomment big sexy hair spray to go with it, as if you have stubborn hair like me, you will need a good hair spray to keep the curls after you curl it.</li>
    <li> love how my hair looks using this! i have used this for a wedding I attended, going to work, out to dinner, or just when i needed to fix a bad hair day. i love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As much as I love how this product makes my hair look, I have only used it about 15 times in the past 2 years and it just died out of no where. I am very disappointed at the lifespan of this waver. I have to adjust my rating since the length of life does not live up to a 5 star expectation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to get my hair like this. The iron heats up fast. I use thermal heat styling product tres semme and for the crunchy look I also use paul mitchelle styling gel. I Dont regret buying this at alloit gives me the salon look ive even uploaded pics so c for urself :)</li>
    <li> Just bought it in January and it already stopped working! This is a scam of a company, do not buy from them. It will not turn on no matter what plug I put it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this tool, adds so much spunk to my hair!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my hot tools deep waver! it work so good, and fast and easy. And my waves come out beautifully.</li>
    <li> I love my new deep waver. I wish I would have looked into buying one sooner.  The drawlbacks are that it doesn&#x27;t blink to tell you that it&#x27;s heating up.  There&#x27;s not even a light to let you know that it&#x27;s on!!</li>
    <li> Works great and I use it almost everyday.</li>
    <li> I used it about 8 times and it quit working on me. It worked well the 8 times I did use it, but not worth the price for its lack of longevity.</li>
    <li> Good, but it may make up the display for the truth, but a great experience and you need a bit of adjustment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> To hard to very ever exact curls</li>
    <li> Love my waver! Would always get my hair done at my hair stylist with this tool &amp; decided to buy one myself. I get tons of compliments when I use this to do my hair &amp; it stays waved and looking great for days on end! Great purchase &amp; able to do it myself ... Price is awesome too!</li>
    <li> My sister has used this like 2 times ever since she bought it. Even in the lowest setting it feels like its burning your hair. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> great product works very well with thermal spray. gives hair nice deep waves that last all day. great for a different look..</li>
    <li> came on time. love love love it!</li>
    <li> I thought this would be more likely to give that beachy/ victoria&#x27;s secret type of waves.  I tried it and was not happy with the result.  My hair was huge and the waves were awkward.  My husband actually laughed at my hair after using it...  needless to say, I don&#x27;t see myself taking the time to try to perfect this.  I&#x27;ll stick with a regular curling iron.</li>
    <li> Bought for my 17 yr old daughter and she really liked it.</li>
    <li> This waver gives the look of pin curls or loose finger waves without the time...I love it!!!!! (Just be careful because the outside of the wavers gets VERY HOT and I burned my shoulder pretty badly)</li>
    <li> I love the way this makes my hair so wavy. It takes a little while to get done but the results are worth it</li>
    <li> I used one at work and it made my daughters hair look awesome. So I decided to buy one for home.</li>
    <li> I am a professional cosmetologist, and the price of this product (And free shipping!) on Amazon is CHEAPER than buying this item at a professional beauty supply store with our professional discount!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was simple to use, created amazing wave and has a variable temp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> PROS: Works very well&lt;br /&gt;  Heats up in a flash&lt;br /&gt;  Makes great waves&lt;br /&gt;  Gets very hot &amp; Stays hot!&lt;br /&gt;  Has a lock feature that keeps waver closed&lt;br /&gt;  Has a plastic cover for plug.(Saftey fist)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Has no indicator light telling you when it is on.&lt;br /&gt;  Super easy to burn yourself!&lt;br /&gt;  Style is kind of akward &amp; uncomfortable to use at times.&lt;br /&gt;  No velcro to tie up cord when finished.&lt;br /&gt;  Very easy to burn your hair if not careful.&lt;br /&gt;  Temp. dial is OUTSIDE of the waver so its easy to change the temp. to high or low while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great waver. But there are a few things that could of made this product better. But it gets the job done wonderfully and in a timely manner. It used to take me 45-60 minutes to wave my hair (because it&#x27;s length) it took me 25 minutes with this one! GREAT TIME SAVER &amp; GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Do not buy, I bought it and used it for about two weeks and as I was doing half of my hair it went cold now u plug it in and it doesn&#x27;t heat up. There is also no light indicator I&#x27;ve tried all plugs in the whose house. Also happened to my friend who bought the same one.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron and it worked great it gave just the right amount of curl to my hair. I did not use it much and kept it on a medium setting. But after only a few times using it it STOPPED WORKING!! It will not get hot anymore. I paid a pretty penny of this iron and I feel as though I did not get full use out of it. I have had curing irons last me for years and still work. I need to find out how I can get my money back.</li>
    <li> I love my deep waver! I am really not gifted when it comes to hair, but this makes it easy to get cute wavy hair. It takes a little practice to get used to using, but once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s pretty easy. My favorite new hair tool. :)</li>
    <li> This is the first deep waver I have ever bought, and needless to say I am very happy with my purchase! When I first felt the item, I was a little skeptical because it doesn&#x27;t feel like it would be super excellent quality, but the results speak for themselves! This was my first time even using a deep waver, and it was very easy to use and to find what temperature worked best for my hair without over doing it. I watched some tutorials on youtube and read all the reviews for this deep waver and others on the market before I took the plunge and ordered it. All the reviews that give this Hot Tool a thumbs up are right on. Overall, couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase, and I would definitely suggest this product to other people in the market for a deep waver!</li>
    <li> I have been so hyped about this product after watching a YouTube Guru say tons of marvelous things about it and watching a few tutorials- One thing no one mentioned that I wasn&#x27;t expecting is that the handle heats up if you have the heat turned up half way, I can only imagine how hot it gets at full heat!! I have hard to curl hair and it stayed curled all day, didn&#x27;t fry my thin hair, and withstood extreme heat and humidity! Overall great product!</li>
    <li> This is a very handy little tool for those days you want a wavy hairstyle but don&#x27;t have the time to use your hot rollers.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair tool I love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Easy to use. Very effective!!!</li>
    <li> I got a lot of complements when I used this the first time, but I will say that it doesn&#x27;t give as deep a wave on my hair as I hoped. Still overall I was happy with the look.</li>
    <li> This was my first time ordering with Amazon and everything was great! This is also my first time using a deep waver, and I absolutely love it. This is my favorite styling tool that I own so far. I love how easy it is to use and how much volume it gives your hair. I would definitely recommend this deep waver to anyone who wants a different look and is tired of the straight hair styles. :)))</li>
    <li> I love my deep waver it came on time &amp; it works beautifully my hair just needs to get use to the wave because it tends to kind of drop after a few 20 minutes but other then that I LOVE IT !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great , but a lot of work for someone with long hair</li>
    <li> I got this for Christmas this year, used it once and the next time I used it, I was half way done with my hair and it stopped working. I was so mad and had to send it back. Not only did I have to redo my half finished hair, I also wasn&#x27;t even very thrilled with the waves compared to other crimpers I had used.</li>
    <li> Ladies this tool works miraculously perfect! It leaves beautiful waves &amp; they last all day! I definitely do recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you have hard to curl hair or hair that won&#x27;t hold a curl, then you&#x27;ve got to try this iron! My hair is naturally straight and curl falls out in about an hour looking like it needs to be washed. This iron creates a gorgeous &amp;#34;mermaid-like&amp;#34; wave pattern that is beachy, sexy and playful- it lasts for days! You can crimp the iron slowly for deeper waves or faster for a subtle bend- I always get TONS of compliments when i use it! And its so easy to use- highly recommended!</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter for Christmas.  She used it 5 times (or less) and now it will not work. Just in time for the return window to have expired.  So happy that I am out $$  thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> this product is nice and good . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I love it. The product works really great and heats up fast. It&#x27;s also easy to use. I would def recommend it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Works exactly as it says.</li>
    <li> Creates awesome waves that stay put! It doesn&#x27;t have an adjustable temperature and it gets really hot, so if you shy away from heat this may not be for you. It does what it is supposed to do and it has held up nicely to repeated use, or shall I say, abuse, for over two years by myself and two teenage daughters.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girls and they LOVE it!  Thanks for a great product and a great price!</li>
    <li> This product worked really well - was used frequently by myself, my sister, and my mom. Made your hair look great! Got pretty hot so you had to make sure it didnt melt the counter top. However it would not turn on suddenly, after 8 months. Bummer. And return window is only like a month and a half.</li>
    <li> Remarkable! Simple to use.I will only buy hot tools products now. I have been thoroughly impressed. I recommend this product and brand to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> This deep waver creates the perfect waves! My hair has been as long as the middle of my back to just above my shoulders and it works perfect for both lengths.</li>
    <li> just ok not really deep.</li>
    <li> My hair didn&#x27;t hold the waves at all with this product. Looks like a hot mess. Hopefully it will be better over time but it really only adds volume to my already very thick hair and no real waves</li>
    <li> so i had bought one from marshalls and it ended up getting snatched by my aunt who moved out of country (ugh *expletive deleted*) anyways, i could not find one like it ever again!!!&lt;br /&gt;and then i became an avid amazon.com shopper and found this and it is so much better than the i had before!&lt;br /&gt;it makes my hair soooo wavy (my hair is about down to the middle of my back) and doesn&#x27;t burn it out like the other one did. the one i had previously was from revlon i think.</li>
    <li> This iron is fantastic.  I have very straight hair and love the beach wave look. It took a few tries to get it to look just right but now I can do my entire head in about 10 minutes. I use a thermal heat activating spray beforehand to protect my hair. I recommend going on YouT*** and looking up some tutorials.  That&#x27;s how I learned. It looks very natural and I get compliments on it all the time!</li>
    <li> Received as a gift and used it once with great success.  Perfect waves.  Midway through the second use, it quit heating completely.  Despite attempts to jiggle the cord, turn it off and back on, it was dead.  Fortunately was able to return to Amazon for a refund.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because at the time I hadn&#x27;t figured out how to curl my hair.  This gives me pretty waves, but its way to hot and damages my hair.  I have used it maybe 3 times in the year that I have owned it.  I can&#x27;t compare it to others though because I have never tried anything else.</li>
    <li> Works great!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> If you have naturally curly hair but the top gets flat or dull after sleeping on it, this thing is a miracle worker for touching it up. I seriously don&#x27;t know how I survived my curly hair days before without it!</li>
    <li> Works very good..for beach looks...gets extremely hot..make sure used on human hair or human hair weave... Very fast and easy to use..</li>
    <li> This is by far the best curled I have ever purchased! After a couple YouTube tutorials I am in love with this product!  The waves are so deep and natural looking and I get so many compliments whenever I style my hair with this! I&#x27;ve seen a couple of reviews on this product that it quit working after a couple times but I have had no real problems.. sometimes it does take longer to heat up but I&#x27;ve found if you dial up the temperature a little it works perfectly!  Bottom line I would recommend this product to anyone wanting deep waves.</li>
    <li> Product is good, like the fun wave it gives long hair, got it for a gift so we&#x27;ll have to see the end product on them</li>
    <li> When I decided to buy this waver I thought I could do really beautiful wavy hair as I see on the tv. But it needs kind of technique for making pretty wavy style. If you have thick hair you will be pretty but my hair is not. I guess this is why. The waver itself is very good quality</li>
    <li> I have fine hair which never holds a curl. I bought this waver and am very happy with it. Took me about 15-20 minutes to finish my hair and it held the wave all day. you do not need to have it on the highest heat setting if you have fine hair. you may burn it by doing so.</li>
    <li> The product itself was great, I really enjoyed using it, but it stopped working very suddenly in the middle of a project and now I have no way of finishing. This is the last time I spend more than 10 dollars on a styling tool.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite hair tool! It&#x27;s so easy to use. Gets hot very quickly and stays hot. This tool creates such a beautiful and unique look that lasts for days. Takes me about 20 mins to wave (long hair). I debated wether to purchase this one or the bed head waver but I&#x27;m so glad I got this one! Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have naturally frizzy curly hair that I&#x27;ve battled (mostly with straighteners) forever.  I love this waver because it doesn&#x27;t matter how I start...  if I sleep on my wet hair and dry naturally.. it can tame my natural frizzy curl and give it a more uniformed look OR even better if I&#x27;m slow on time I can dry it with a hair dryer AND EVEN STRAIGHTEN it prior to waving and it still does the job.  Usually once you run a straightener over curly hair its not gonna hold any curl after that but with this.. you&#x27;re going to get waves regardless.  It is a bit time consuming but worth it.  The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that it hurts to hold after a few minutes. My hand cramps up while using it but no one ever said beauty wasn&#x27;t pain I guess!</li>
    <li> I bought this from a blog recommendation.  It didn&#x27;t work for my hair.  My hair looked....odd.  In addition, although I can handle any other styling tool, I burned my fingers trying to use this one.  This was returned.</li>
    <li> It was perfect! The tool itself is nice, but we prefer the curling wands over this product.  The curling wands give a more natural appearance.</li>
    <li> I loved what it did to my hair, about the 5 time I used it, it no longered worked. I tried couple little outlets... nope... i kept putting it off to return it to get my money back.... someone in the household threw away to info for me to return it to the manufacture. ANYWAY! Seems like looking at bunch of the reviews that this happened to bunch of people. I might have my dad look at it to fix it... if not i am going to eventually write to the manufacture ...</li>
    <li> Gives great result in a fast and easy fashion. I will say that it looks better after several hours  (meaning, more natural). Great investment in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Good quality seems to work pretty well. It left my hair frizzy, but I just need to find the right product to use in my hair before using the waver.</li>
    <li> Love it. Does exactly what it says!  Got it within 1 week and was actually early I believe. Best tool ever</li>
    <li> I love this tool!! It&#x27;s a fun look. Easy too use. Just take your time use small sections at time.</li>
    <li> This is a great brand! Was given one by my hairdresser and stuck with them since! Great for hard to curl hair!</li>
    <li> I seriously hate this thing. Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but the waves are really ugly.  I used it on my daughter and myself multiple times.</li>
    <li> I was looking for deep waver for a while. I was originally going to buy highly rated &amp; affordable bedhead deep waver. But unfortunately it was out of stock and I was desperate for deep waver so I decided to go for this one instead. My hair is thin and damaged so I didn&#x27;t want waver to be really hot but this one has heat settings unlike bedhead one so you can adjust temperature which was nice. You can create beautiful beach waves effortlessly. This is very convenient, easy to use and quick to heat up. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the weird smells that some people were talking about. The scent was stronger than I thought.. I don&#x27;t really know if I will have to deal with this stinky weird scent every time I use or its just temporally thing...I&#x27;m not sure. If you are cool with this scent, this is really nice deep waver!</li>
    <li> works well on my hair gives large waves. no on/off lights which would be nice. Overall exactly what I needed for the price</li>
    <li> Got this product wanting a little more dimension to my hair styling. This product is easy to use, heats up quick, and holds the curl and style all day! My hair is typically hard to keep styled and hold curls but this product creates those desired beachy-waves that are so popular and gets it done quick so you can get out the door.</li>
    <li> I WANTED THIS DEEP WAVER SO BAD..WHEN I GOT IT.IT WAS USED AND THE WORD OF THE BRAND WAS OFF,AND IT NEVER TURNED ON.WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,LIKE ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW..YOU KNOW THIS S*** WAS NOT GOOD AND THEY SEND IT ANYWAYS.NEVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS. I&#x27;m warning you. I used this once, yesterday. Today I&#x27;ve had to cut my hair (which hasn&#x27;t been cut in four years) because it burnt my hair. When I say burnt I mean burnt. I&#x27;m still trying to get the smell out of my hair. It smokes no matter what temperature I put it on. If I could give this a zero I would.</li>
    <li> I love this waver! I get tons of compliments on my hair when I use it.  It does damage pretty quickly though so I wouldn&#x27;t use it if your hair is already damaged.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so upset with the fact I order 2 hot toll however I was only shipped 1 item, the trouble is you have no way to get to a person even when they charged me for 2 items and I only recieved 1 item.  I so upset with this company for not getting in touch with me 24 hours later,  and Christmas is 2 days away.</li>
    <li> Waste of time. I have really long hair that is able to take curls and lots of different hairstyles and for the amount of time it takes to do this, I think I could just wear bed head hair, or just dried hair and have the same effect. Spend your money on this brands curlers.</li>
    <li> People! Don&#x27;t even finish reading this review- just buy it, you will never ever regret it. You can use this on dirty hair and put off washing for 2 more days! If that&#x27;s not awesome I don&#x27;t know what is. It takes me 3 minutes to do my whole head and it looks great! there are some tricks to lining it up and holding it up at the crown on the top of your head, that make it look even better- play around with it!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS WAVER! I always want to curl my hair, but it takes FOREVER and it never lasts long. This Deep Waver is so easy to use, holds up all day (and over night!) and thats without using hair spray! I have thin hair, but I have ALOT of it, so normally when I want to do something, I have soooo many chunks to do to make it look right. With this tool, I can do larger chunks and its so easy! Did I mention it take no time at all!?!? I HIGHLY recommend this product! Best Waver ever!! Makes hair look AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> I have super think heavy hair. It always makes curls fall out and/or gets super frizzy. Well this is super easy, super fast, and work so so well!! I love it!  Amd tbe crimps.last through sleeping on them..A must have forsure!!</li>
    <li> The second I received it in Australia I tried plugging it in and it immediately started to smoke. Really scary. I think the voltage is different I&#x27;m going to try to use a different plug and see what happens. Does anyone know if this product is only for the u.s or can also be used abroad ? Thanks</li>
    <li> I JUST RECIEVED MY HOT TOOLS DEEP WAVER, AFTER BUYING AND RETURNING 4 FROM A COMPANY,THAT DID NOTHING FOR MY BOBBI BOSS WEAVE HAIR, I STARTED TO GIVE UP BUT SAW A REVIEW ON YOUTUBE ABOUT THE PRODUCT BEING USED ON THE SAME TYPE OF HAIR I HAVE NOW, AND THE LOOK WAS VERY BIG AND ROCK AND ROLL WHICH I LUV. I&#x27;M GOING TO TWO CONCERTS IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND WANTED TO CHANGE MY USUAL LOOK, SO THIS IS PERFECT IM ACTUALLY GOING TO ROCK THIS LOOK FOR A BIT. AND NO COMPLAINT AT ALL ABOUT THE SELLER MY WAVE CAME WITHIN TWO DAYS OF ME ORDERING. WELL WORTH THE MONEY.*******************UPDATE*******does still work well but the paint is chipping soooooo bad, I dont use it everyday so its sitting in my storage bin as if its submerged under water lol I like the effect of the device on my hair but the chipping makes me nervouse, im going to try a diffrent brand,,, FYI alot of people are having this problem with it as well I did my research although I did research prior I guess not enough</li>
    <li> do not like it at all, do mess on my heir</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this and gave it a good try but in the end I hated it. I have think, long hair and I just couldn&#x27;t get this to work well with my hair. I have friends who said the same thing. So disappointed</li>
    <li> I have struggled with my naturally curly hair for a long time and this is the only product that works! The waves look natural and it doesn&#x27;t take long to do.</li>
    <li> For deep beautiful waves buy this hot tool. I still have it almost a year later and it works perfectly fine still.</li>
    <li> I used to have a Revlon waver that was great, but finally died.  I decided to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; to this Hot Tools waver.  It literally melted the third time I used it.  After telling a few friends about what happened, I learned that they too had had issues with Hot Tools products.  I will never purchase a Hot Tools again.</li>
    <li> i used it for few times it was lovely, then stopped working completely !! i&#x27;m really disappointed . when i did my hair it was the minimal degree i don&#x27;t understand what happened?!!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Works fast and I enjoy that I can adjust the heat.</li>
    <li> After watching some YouTube videos on the Deep Waver and it being compared to other brands (i.e. Bed Head), I decided to purchase this waver. I have a crimper, a curling iron and a wand, but nothing has given me the beach waves I really crave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does!!! Awesome tool, quick and easy to use. It heats up super quick. It does smell a tad unpleasant, but the end result is worth it. Perfect for Kate Hudson style waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend running your fingers through the waves for a more beachy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price on Amazon made this purchase a no-brainer. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this waver, I have only used this waver about 5 times and it has already broke, it won&#x27;t get hot at all. Very&lt;br /&gt;bad product!</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  Heats up fast and you don&#x27;t need to hold it down on your hair for too long.  It just doesn&#x27;t look so good with short hair</li>
    <li> This is a great styling tool.  I watched some you tube videos on how to use it.  My hair is slightly wavy by itself but is thin.  I use this curler and it really adds body and curl, I get a lot of compliments when I use it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a girlfriend as a gift. It works great on her beautiful long hair! Such a feminine, flowy wave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to her is, she is a first time user to these products and it&#x27;s heavy &amp; awkward to get a feel for.&lt;br /&gt;She did an amazing job, the first time out, on her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Telling you this, if you are a 1st time user, because it&#x27;s not as easy as it looks on tv but the results are worth it!!</li>
    <li> I expected a little more from this product.  Love it for my little girl who is 4 but for me not so much.  I have very long thick hair and it takes way to long to use.  But if I had the time it would probably be pretty.  What little bit I have done looked ok but no so sure I would want to take the time to do all over.</li>
    <li> Very good , I love it 👍 wow wow wow very wow  wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow</li>
    <li> Fun to use and unique look.  Just make sure to double up on wave otherwise you get frayed look.</li>
    <li> Best crimper but WILL DEFINATELY stop working after a few months .</li>
    <li> This is a very Alpher wondrous it is founded Btgaid appearance hair beautifully and coordinate very cool advised its use, especially women with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;The seller is very wonderful it is to ship quickly and effectively</li>
    <li> Love this.  It gives my long straight hair amazing waves and texture.  It feels like my hair which is fine and straight is now super thick.  Great and super easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair styling tool I own.  My hair will not hold a curl with a typical curling iron.  Using this waver, my hair will keep the same amount of curliness from when I style until i wash my hair.  This is an easy tool to use that will give you that beach wave look!</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once so far but i am already in love with it. It creates beautiful mermaid waves.</li>
    <li> ok, I dont know if I&#x27;m doing it wrong, or if it just doesnt work. This product goes up to 420 degrees and doesnt wave my hair ???? i left it on for like 10 seconds, more than that it will burn my hair! I dont know but now im stuck with this thing.</li>
    <li> Love the results! But makes my thumb sore by the rough handle</li>
    <li> My friend asked me to buy it for here and she loves it. She told me the other one did not work as good as this one.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because its really hard to find a quality deep waver in-store.  The price is unbeatable, and the product was recommended to me by my sister-in-law who is a professional hairdresser who also owns it.  My hair is naturally VERY straight, with this deep waver the waves stay in all day and I can even sleep on my hair and still go through the next day without restyling.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a little tiny bit over a year ago, and it was great, worked like I had hoped it would, made my hair look and feel great. But a little over a week ago I tried to use it and it wouldn&#x27;t get very hot at all. I have thick thick hair, so I have to use a higher heat setting and it wouldn&#x27;t get very hot at all, maybe hot enough to wave/curl someone&#x27;s hair if it was very very fine, but certainly not someone with my thick hair. I was SUPER bummed out because I loved this waver so much AND in the ENTIRE year I owned the device I&#x27;d only used it maybe a grand total of 15 times. (I used it for styling my hair for special occasions only-weddings, photos, parties that sorta thing, as I don&#x27;t like to use heat very often on my hair for damage purposes, so this device didn&#x27;t get much use at all before it decided to die out)!!!! And of course the year warranty is up, very convenient :/ Sooo, I&#x27;m in the market again for another waver that&#x27;ll make my hair beautiful like this one used to, but I definitely won&#x27;t be spending the money on this one again, way to expensive to only last for about 15 uses! Be far warned ladies!</li>
    <li> Say so long to those flat hair days and hello to some awesome waves!  My fine hair waved very easy and quickly with this product.  Waves lasted all day long.  Works great on above the shoulder hair as well as long hair.  Design of this product prevents burnt fingers.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loves it! It is easy to use and quicker than a curling iron. I love the beachy waves it produces.</li>
    <li> I have two teenage daughters that use this all the time. They absolutely love it and gives them great curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a dozen high-end and low-end straighteners throughout my life. And this one I would rank in the top three that I&#x27;ve owned. It has good temperature control it does not snag and I love the wide width.</li>
    <li> The deep waver is sooo quick and easy to use. I have pretty short hair and I like that it doesnt look like i have an afro, just pretty waves. :)</li>
    <li> Daughter has hair that is shoulder blade length blown out - very deep waves, brought it up to right above shoulder, very long hold 2-3 days. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Bought for my ten daughter for Christmas. But I use it as well. Well priced and does a great job. A good purchase that I would make again.</li>
    <li> Saw this on JLovesMac&#x27;s youtube channel. Does what it says. Have to hold your hair in the clamp for quite a while to achieve the desired look, which makes my hair smell almost burnt.</li>
    <li> Returning, stop working the 1st time I used it. Tried different plugs, turning it off and on, tried again an hour later, still nothing.</li>
    <li> Terrible product....this was the second one that we purchased in a years time and both quit working within 6 months of purchase and of course too late to return!  Shame on us for buying the second one!</li>
    <li> excellent product, highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great product! Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> I love the waves it leaves on my hair...I have flat hair so it gives it so much volume.</li>
    <li> Quick shipment, my daughter loves loves the waves it puts in hair.  I have other hot tools brand items  - have always been happy with them</li>
    <li> I love this crimper and the seller was accurate with the description and everything. It arrived exactly on time which made me very happy.</li>
    <li> I just loved my Hot Tools. It is very easy to use and made my hair very beautiful. In Brazil most of the girls prefer their hair very straight, but I made it curly and I loved to look like Shakira lol</li>
    <li> Really easy and creates a super cute hairstyle! I have boring hair with no volume and this creates a fun style that lasts all day :)</li>
    <li> Works super fast! My hair is straight and this keeps the crimp in. Love it! Shipped quickly. I also have a hot tools curling iron and have not had any problems with that. Hot tools is the brand!</li>
    <li> otimo poduto , funciona muito bem como o indicado, facil manuseio. e vc economizar&amp;aacute; muito no salão. j&amp;aacute; que conseguira fazer sozinha</li>
    <li> I am totally in love with this deep waver! It makes a lot of gorgeous waves, even the &amp;#34;Rita Hayworth&amp;#34; style. It&#x27;s the best hair tool I ever had.</li>
    <li> My niece had the most beautiful hair at Christmas after using a  Hot Tools 2179 Deep Waver with Ceramic Tourmaline And Pulse Technology iron so I ordered one, its for LONG hair and LONG hair only!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deep waver! The style lasts for a couple days and is so simple to use!</li>
    <li> Works just as I hoped it would! Amazing product! Would definitely recommend to anyone who has a hard time achieving those beachy waves!</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;-heats up really fast&lt;br /&gt;-creates the most beautiful full waves&lt;br /&gt;-waves last all day!&lt;br /&gt;-perfect for ladies with thin hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-has a slight smell, but isn&#x27;t that noticeable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Makes wonderful full waves with a adjustable heat.  I have hard to curl thick hair that requires high heat to hold.  This product worked exceptionally.</li>
    <li> It worked only 1 day, it stopped working the next day. It wouldnt heat up at sll. I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Definitely a good purchase. Heats up quick and the waves stay all day! It has a smell though while it heats but it&#x27;s manageable.</li>
