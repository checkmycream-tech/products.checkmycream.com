      <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
      <li>It looks sooo healthy and shiny and smells amazing !</li>
      <li>Love everything about it!</li>
      <li>And that&#x27;s really amazing as silver and gray hair tends to be unmanageable.  </li>
      <li>Amazing results.</li>
      <li>I used the hydrating version before and it was nice.</li>
      <li>Smells great and keeps my hair healthy :)</li>
      <li>and I liked it, but realized after a while the buildup&lt;br /&gt;never</li>
      <li>Nice product.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if it can make my hair shinier looking too.</li>
      <li>I thought the shampoo was very nice, but the conditioner feels so cheap</li>
      <li>Very good product, just as described and very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>My colorist said it best - if you&#x27;re going to spend money on your color, then buy a good shampoo to make it last.  </li>
      <li>I still give it an excellent rating because it is such a good product, in spite of the container.</li>
      <li>My most favorite shampoo and conditioner for treated hair, and about $20 cheaper than if I had bought it in the salon!</li>
      <li>It was the first time I&#x27;ve tried and I loved it!</li>
      <li>The Shampoo is great, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t worth the money I paid for that</li>
      <li>Received them very quickly too!</li>
      <li>After blow drying (on the lowest setting, of course) and then flat ironing a couple of stubborn strands, I can honestly say I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
      <li>A HUGE thank you to Pureology for the P4P line!  </li>
      <li>I love the shampoo, but the conditioner has a &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell to it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>You may pay a bit more</li>
      <li>but Amazon often has better deals.</li>
      <li>Perfect for blonde hair...substantial conditioner.</li>
      <li>You will absolutely love your hair, I promise.  </li>
      <li>But then, when I was shopping at Ulta, I noticed that this formula was for hair that has been lightened four or more levels.  </li>
      <li>Love it:)</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have colored treated hair and was looking for more softness and shine, but I didn&#x27;t get it.  </li>
      <li>There are better shampoos to buy for the price.</li>
      <li>The conditioner does not have the trademark &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that the Hydrate has and smells more floral than minty</li>
      <li>And I like the P4P formula as well as Strength Cure, maybe better.  </li>
      <li>Love Pureology.</li>
      <li>I love how my hair feels after each use.  </li>
      <li>So much better</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very pleased with delivery, packaging and product as advertised.  Thanks</li>
    <li> my wife says, this is great</li>
    <li> Pureology makes great products. This is excellent shampoo and conditioner. The scent of both of these items is fabulous. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Smells great and keeps my hair healthy :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure the conditioner is a genuine Pureology product.  I thought the shampoo was very nice, but the conditioner feels so cheap and it smells terrible.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Which is thin and dry. But even with a 3-color highlight (which can be hard on long, thin hair), Pureology retains the color and leaves my hair soft and supply. Pricey but worth it. I tried the cheaper no-sulfate versions but they left my hair sticky. This is the only shampoo I&#x27;ll use now, after the investment I make to color it.</li>
    <li> for the price, I didn&#x27;t find this product all that great.  I have colored treated hair and was looking for more softness and shine, but I didn&#x27;t get it.  I switched to Onesta</li>
    <li> Makes hair very static. Not very satisfied</li>
    <li> This is the mother load for blondes! I love this shampoo. I have gone back and forth between red hair and blonde and I have used this shampoo for the transition and I will tell you what!!! It has not let me down. My hair always stays soft and manageable. I shampoo and condition my hair. After I rinse the conditioner out of my hair I put it up in a scrunchy. I do not brush or comb my hair while it is wet. The next day when it is dry I carefully pick my hair. I did say pick. When you use a pick then you don&#x27;t have fine teeth ripping through your hair and tearing it and causing the split ends. I have done this for over 20 years with my hair and I have gone from brunette, blonde, red head, blonde, red head, blonde...well you get the idea. If you need to use something while your hair is wet then use the pick also. A comb or brush will literally rip your hair to shreds and cause really bad spit ends and friz eventually. Start from the bottom of your hair and work your way up with the pick and I will tell you what....it just doesn&#x27;t hurt so bad either.</li>
    <li> there is no better hair care product out there</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought.  I used Pureology before, couldn&#x27;t remember the shampoo and conditioner smell like cheap perfume.  The quality is not good either, it leaves something on my hair and makes my hair feel heavy and greasy.</li>
    <li> This was not the real shampoo and conditioner. There is a distinct smell for each one, and it doesn&#x27;t have that smell. Whoever is selling this put a non pureolgy brand of shampoo and conditioner in the pureolgy bottle</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I like the Pureology  Hydrate conditioner better. My hair was not as dry with the other conditioner compared to this one.</li>
    <li> This shampoo left my hair feeling weird and not clean. I didn&#x27;t like the smell either. There are better shampoos to buy for the price. I used the hydrating version before and it was nice. The platinum is not as good at all. I actually prefer Redkin over this one and the redkin is much more reasonably priced. I do not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love these products, thanks! Received them very quickly too!</li>
    <li> This is the best product! My hair has never looked so good. A little goes a long way. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Loved the shampoo, the conditioner smells funny and leaves my hair dry. Went back to pureology hydrate conditioner</li>
    <li> great products as always</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big Pureology fan.  I use the Strength Cure shampoo and conditioner and really love them.  They leave my hair soft, silky and shiny.  But then, when I was shopping at Ulta, I noticed that this formula was for hair that has been lightened four or more levels.  I&#x27;ve recently had balayage done with bleach (with Olaplex thank heavens!) so my hair has been more abused than usual.  This seemed like the perfect fit.  I wouldn&#x27;t be giving up the conditioning power of Strength Cure, which is also sulfate free and for &amp;#34;micro scarred&amp;#34; hair.  And I like the P4P formula as well as Strength Cure, maybe better.  It gives me beautifully soft, silky, shiny hair that responds very well to my styling efforts.  I have a good hair day every time I use Pureology products.  And I love the way they smell.  Expensive, yes, but well worth it.  When my hair looks terrific I feel like a million bucks, lol!  I also use the P4P Cool Blond Enhancing Treatment mask, which neutralizes the ugly yellow tones in my neutral blond hair.  It also leaves my hair healthy looking and super shiny.  All the Pureology products I&#x27;ve tried have been excellent.  I have a hall closet full of hair product FAILS that I have wasted countless dollars on that now just gather dust, so I don&#x27;t feel the least bit uneasy about spending more for products that actually live up to their claims. And Pureology products definitely do.  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt or looked this good since before I started coloring it (many, many moons ago I&#x27;m afraid).  I have a considerable amount of gray hair which is much more coarse and wiry than the rest of my medium/fine hair and these products work well enough to tame those tresses into submission (even though they&#x27;ve been colored over, they&#x27;re still a different texture).  P4P is very hydrating so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suitable for fine hair.  Instead, I recommend Strength Cure, which is lighter but is still sulfate free and therefore color safe.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with the Pureology products I&#x27;ve tried and will continue to use them.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything better on the market.  While at first glance the small bottles look very expensive, it only takes a small amount because they&#x27;re so concentrated.  I use about two teaspoons of shampoo and the same amount of conditioner for my shoulder length hair.  So these bottles last much longer than you might think.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I paid $27.50 for the shampoo and $29.50 for the conditioner at Ulta but Amazon often has better deals. If you&#x27;re thinking of trying Pureology P4P, and your hair has been lightened considerably, I urge you to take the plunge and try them.  There&#x27;s nothing else quite like them.  You will absolutely love your hair, I promise.  I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner (and the toning treatment).products I&#x27;ve tried and will continue to use them.

    <li> Pureology has saved my hair. I hate that it&#x27;s pricy but you get what you pay for. Amazing results. The smell is a little &amp;#34;head and shoulders-ey&amp;#34; but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> I normally use the Pureology Hydrating shampoo and conditioner (the one in the purple bottle) but I decided to switch it up and try this one. It&#x27;s good. My hair feels great but it feels very similar to when I would use the other shampoo and conditioner. I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my blonde highlights compared to the Hydrate. I&#x27;ll probably just end up going back to the Hydrate but I wouldn&#x27;t mind sticking to this. It smells good. I don&#x27;t think you really can go wrong with Pureology products.</li>
    <li> Very good product, just as described and very fast shipping.</li>
    <li> After repeatedly dying my hair and using heat styling tools every day my hair was extremely damaged and dry. It even started thinning and falling out.  I was at a loss as to what to do.  I tried so many over the counter products that promised great results but failed to help my brittle hair.  Needless to say I have a closet full of hair products that failed.  My hair stylest recommended the Perfect 4 Platinum line and although it&#x27;s hard to fork over the dough to afford it, it is well worth it!  My hair is well on it&#x27;s way back to being healthy, soft, and manageable.  It has actually started to grow in thicker (thanks to a Biotin supplement I&#x27;m taking) as well as using P4P.  It lasts a long time too!  I bought both the shampoo and conditioner and 6 weeks later I&#x27;m still using the same bottles.  A little definitely goes a long way.  A HUGE thank you to Pureology for the P4P line!  You have saved my hair!</li>
    <li> This had a drying effect for me unfortunately.  I do get my hair highlighted, but I&#x27;m not so sure that it is four shades higher than my usual color.  The bottle indicates that you should not use this unless you have lightened your hair at least four shades.  I was afraid that it might effect the color of my highlights, so I stopped using it.  I will give it to my niece who has treated hair that I think fits the criteria for this product.</li>
    <li> I do not dye my hair although this is for dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used pureology hydration series for years and finally decided to try something new and I LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is so smooth and soft, and it has grown so much since my ends are not splitting or breaking as much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for years and pay much more in salons. This keeps my color vibrant for a long time. Does not wear my fine hair down.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever had! It makes my hair soft and shiny, very manageble and relaxed. I don&#x27;t even need to put any other products on my hair, because it already looks silky and healthy as it is just after wash. It also foams so easy, you need very little amount of shampoo per use. It is a wonderful product. Definitely will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> I REALLY RECOMMNEDED FOR ANY TYPE OF HAIR ACCORDING WITH THE PRODUCT LINE AVAILABLE.&lt;br /&gt;IT LITTLE EXPENSIVE,BUT IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER LINE IN MARKET.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that is very wild and extremely dry.  I also happen to color it blonde, which makes it even dryer.  So I go back and forth between a conditioning line and blonde line, so the color doesn&#x27;t get brassy.  While I don&#x27;t think you can ever go wrong with Pureology, I didn&#x27;t notice nearly as much of a difference in keeping my blonde strands looking fresh as I did with a brand like Clariol, that most hair dressers use, which is about 1/3 of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: Stick to Pureology for dry hair, oily hair, etc. line of shampoo/conditioner &amp; keep the color stay lines to the chemical, non organic lines.  Sometimes you just gotta have those chemicals!</li>
    <li> This product is not what it use to be. It really dries out my blonde hair and makes it unmanageable! I will not buy again.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine recommended  to me, probably the best product I have ever tried for my hair. Makes ir smooth and shiny. And the best part is that is made out of vegetables ingredients.  The delivery on time.</li>
    <li> I usually use the pureology in the purple bottle and absolutely love it! I thought I would try this one for a change. It unfortunately felt like it left a lot of build-up on my hair and made it really tangly when dry. It smells really good though.</li>
    <li> Not as impressed as I was with the original product. Did not see any difference or longer lasting high-lights. The good thing about this product is that a little does go a long way. For us with the long thick hair girls we tend to use a bit more...not with this, but my hair felt kind of hard after rinsing out the conditioner and not as smooth to the touch I get with other products. Most likely, I am going to stick with something priced a bit more reasonably. Not worth the money for me.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Worked well at the salon.  Good to have at home too.</li>
    <li> So far it&#x27;s working good. I thought it would make my blonde brighter but it really doesn&#x27;t work for brightness. It does make my hair soft and I like the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling, but very watered down from what you buy in the salons.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pureology for years and live this shampoo/conditioner.&#x27;its all natural, and leaves my hair feeling great. I also use the Pureology nano hair mask once a week and it keeps my highlighted blonde hair less damaged.</li>
    <li> I just loved Purology products. It was the first time I&#x27;ve tried and I loved it! Smells really good and the hair is really shinny after using it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I received a generous sample of this shampoo and conditioner in a guest package given to all who attended a jewelry party.  I was dissatisfied with how my hair was &amp;#34;misbehaving&amp;#34; and tried it the next time I washed my hair.  What an amazing difference in the texture and manageability from one usage!</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy more of this product! I can feel a difference right after using, my hair is so soft shiny and it accents my natural highlights</li>
    <li> I Love how it gives my hair body and shine. I recommend this product. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is so good for my hair.  I can really tell a difference when I style it.  The smell is not great, but not bad either.  There&#x27;s always differing opinions on smell.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
    <li> The shampoo lathers up in my well water with a luxurious amount of creamy lather.  Feels decadent and smells like heaven.  The conditioner is really rich and nice as well.  Purple tint to the shampoo makes this great for blondes concerned about brassiness.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shampoo, it is great for color treated hair, and leaves hair super soft and shiny. Love it!</li>
    <li> Having frizzy hair, this did not do anything to better my hair, but I have hopes that it helps thin, silky hair.</li>
    <li> Love Pureology products but this one was to heavy for my hair. I think this one is geared towards more chemically damaged hair and hair with more curls and frizz.</li>
    <li> Hair feels manageable especially because I process it often. Great deal. Genuine ptoduct.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo! Thanks</li>
    <li> Oh, pureology - ours is a love/hate relationship...I love what you do for my hair, but hate what you do to my wallet. My colorist said it best - if you&#x27;re going to spend money on your color, then buy a good shampoo to make it last.  For all you blond highlighters, this is that shampoo!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged by hair coloring.  This set made my hair softer to the touch.  It would be nice if it can make my hair shinier looking too.</li>
    <li> I love pureology and pretty much all of their products.  This product was no exception.  It made my hair feel great after one use.  I only wish I would&#x27;ve paid better attention to the description.  I thought these looked a lot bigger on the picture, but these are small bottles of shamp/cond.  Wish I would&#x27;ve order a bigger set.</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair packaged at a nice price!</li>
    <li> I love these platinum blonde products from Pureology. It makes my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
    <li> It is pricey but so very worth it. At least the price here is cheaper than at a salon. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> Always have loved this shampoo, makes my hair soft and makes the blonde stay blonde! Recommend this to anyone who highlights their hair.</li>
    <li> Love Pureology. My hair gets stronger and shiner every month.</li>
    <li> Love everything about it! I switched from WEN, and while I wasn&#x27;t losing a lot of hair using WEN, I&#x27;m definitely losing less now.</li>
    <li> makes your hair like straw or oily, one or both&lt;br /&gt;I used it a while and I liked it, but realized after a while the buildup&lt;br /&gt;never went away&lt;br /&gt;I do think it might b a decent product if you DO NOT use any kind of hair&lt;br /&gt;products, ie. mouse, gel, seaspray, hairspray, hair texturizer&lt;br /&gt;IF you use any of this stuff, the shampoo will not get it out of your hair, escpecially&lt;br /&gt;over time when the build up occurs&lt;br /&gt;back to paul Mitchell for good now. yes it has sulfates, but it cleans your hair</li>
    <li> This product is magic for blondes!  My hair glistens and everyone comments on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love Redken! Their products are terrific. Pureology is their higher end brand. You may pay a bit more but it&#x27;s so worth it to have amazing hair. I&#x27;m a hair product junky! Pureology is one brand I will continue to use .</li>
    <li> Great shampoo! My hairdresser turned me on to it several months back and I love it. It is a little pricey, but is concentrated so it lasts a little longer than most shampoos.</li>
    <li> I have recently gone platinum a few months ago and was told by my stylist to use this product to keep my hair a whiter blonde.  I have used this product over the last few months and noticed it cuts down on the brassiness that can be caused from consistent washings.  When using the shampoo do not use more than a dime size dollop, and make sure to rub it in your hands to create suds before massaging the concentrate into your wet hair.  The purple color can add a red undertone to your blonde if not muted with water first.  Also, I would recommend using this every other wash and coupling it with Pureology Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo, but the conditioner has a &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell to it.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Happy I bought it on Amazon and didn&#x27;t pay salon prices.  Smells and works great.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this shampoo and conditioner combo. She usually purchases it at our local ULTA, however, they did not have it in stock. So, she found it on Amazon and it was cheaper than at ULTA. Needless to say she bought it and is happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner for myself as I love the &amp;#34;pure volume&amp;#34; that this company sells.  My husband used this &amp;#34;Platinum Shampoo&amp;#34; that I just purchased and loves it.  This is the first time in MANY YEARS I&#x27;ve been able to get him away from his old standard.  It makes your hair really soft and manageable.  And that&#x27;s really amazing as silver and gray hair tends to be unmanageable.  My husband and I both highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo!  My hairdresser recommended it and now it&#x27;s all I use.  My hair is shinier and looking better than it has in along time.</li>
    <li> This product is insane ! And worth every penny !! I have been fighting dry weak hair for years that will not grow...this product after one wash made my hair soooo soft !! It looks sooo healthy and shiny and smells amazing ! Its crazy expensive but a little goes a long way !! I have brown hair with highlights...used WEN FOR 6 MONTHS and loved until I tried this !!! So much better</li>
    <li> I love how my hair feels after each use.  It is so healthy!  I have changed to other products and always come back to this one.  You will enjoy washing your hair with this product.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser has me using thsee  I am happy with them both and my hair doesn&#x27;t turn red is as it used to</li>
    <li> Great! Have been using this for years now.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, this shampoo and conditioner dosen&#x27;t over condition. I always have a good hair day when I use these products.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve come across in years and I&#x27;ve used many , many different professional shampoos and conditioners. And it smells GREAT !!</li>
    <li> A very good and effective product for blond hair. Love it:)</li>
    <li> Perfect! I love this product changed my hair after using it one time!!</li>
    <li> smells and feels good</li>
    <li> This is the real deal here. Keeps my blonde bright and keeps it ultra soft, light weight, and smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. My most favorite shampoo and conditioner for treated hair, and about $20 cheaper than if I had bought it in the salon!</li>
    <li> I have always loved the smell and feel of Pureology shampoo and conditioner, however this order is questionable. I live in Germany, stationed here, so buying online is currently only option. The shampoo and conditioner feels cheap, especially the conditioner, so I am very disappointed. Also, the conditioner smells gross, which makes me think it is not truly Pureology. That being said, will ask a family member in the states to purchase from a salon and mail to me. Such a shame.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get my hair to grow and be healthy for so long. I used to change colors all the time. I finally stuck to blonde, started using the shampoo/condition, and it&#x27;s so long! I ONLY use Pureology products. They are worth every penny. They do not dry out your hair, and they make it smooth. I love the fact that is it vegan. I recommend these products to everyone I know!</li>
    <li> After 3 uses I can say that my hair is starting to feel softer, is more manageable and less frizzy. I shampoo it twice and use the conditioner.</li>
    <li> The Shampoo is great, but the conditioner doesn&#x27;t worth the money I paid for that, it look like a cheap product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Shimmer Lights. This shampoo is fine but it does nothing special for my platinum blonde. Very expensive for the volume as well compared to shimmer lights which works wonders.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Why?? Because I pay $175.00 to get my hair cut, colored and highlighted and I want it to last.  When I use Pureology it does just that.  Another up side is it makes my hair manageable.  The best!!!!</li>
    <li> I first purchased this at my salon.  My hairdresser recommended this particular Pureology because, though it&#x27;s for platinum blondes, it would also brighten my grey hair,which I absolutely refuse to color.  It does and it also moisturizes.  My only complaint it the difficulty of getting the lids off and on and getting the product out.  I still give it an excellent rating because it is such a good product, in spite of the container.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have been using Pureology for a few years and their products clean well, smell great, and don&#x27;t leave weird residues.  I wash my hair every other day and these are perfect - I don&#x27;t feel greasy the second day.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that i was buying shampoo for hair that was SEVERELY lightened. Mine is only highlighted a shade or two, so this didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Left my hair weighted down, not soft and clean. My fault i guess. I also have extremely fine hair.</li>
    <li> too expensive and not any different than any other shamppo</li>
    <li> Perfect for blonde hair... makes hair shiny and beautiful, and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Hate the smell! Also, quite expensive and no better than other, cheaper shampoos. I did not notice any difference in terms of color retention. Sticking to Pantene in the future.</li>
    <li> Didnt do much for my highlighted long hair, somewhat drying and smalls odd to me. Think the formula has changed, my hairstylist could tell I started a different product. Not worth the cost, wouldnt recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this product for blonde hair!</li>
    <li> arrived in a timesly manner, great product</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> My hair feels smooth, healthy and is shiny after using this product. I have been a loyal to Purology for 5 years now- I&#x27;ll never use another brand again!</li>
    <li> I use to use pureology regularly and it worked great. Well this stuff was a totally different story. It made my hair feel like straw and was so difficult to style and it left this funky build up In my hair! It&#x27;s to bad because this stuff use to be great.</li>
    <li> Awesome!!!  Perfect for blonde hair...substantial conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal user of the Pureology brand of products for many many years (probably 15). My favorite has always been the Hydrate shampoo &amp; conditioner (not the light one, the regular one, purple bottles). I tried the Perfect 4 Platinum on a whim because A) the set was nearly $10 less expensive than my usual Hydrate set and B) I had my hair high-lighted the first time in 2 years last week, it was lifted about 5 shades from my normal mousey-dirty blonde to really blonde platinum. This set is perfect! If you &amp;#34;bleach&amp;#34; your hair you know the &amp;#34;tangle&amp;#34; that comes along with the process. Sometimes even conditioning doesn&#x27;t make it smooth, your hair just can feel just coarse while wet. It doesn&#x27;t with the Perfect 4 Platinum system. I can comb through it easily after a just towel drying (my hair is a short graduated bob). After blow drying (on the lowest setting, of course) and then flat ironing a couple of stubborn strands, I can honestly say I&#x27;m impressed. My hair is smooth but not flat and shiny and not brassy. I like it and will definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of points of interest:&lt;br /&gt;* The shampoo is a light aqua-teal blue, not the standard purple or lilac you would expect for a just for blondes shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;* The conditioner does not have the trademark &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that the Hydrate has and smells more floral than minty, it&#x27;s quite pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair is fine-to-normal, some natural wave, and cut in a short layered bob. I like to wash it every day and there&#x27;s no build-up with Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;* I only use a small amount of styling glaze and maybe a spritz of holding gel.&lt;br /&gt;The set arrived on-time and was packaged in a padded envelope and enclosed in a ziplock bag. Best wishes! :)</li>
    <li> They changed the conditioner formula and I dont like it at all now. Too heavy and left my hair feeling greasy even after thorough rinsing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the true pureology shampoo. Worked for me 3 years ago when I bleached my hair and damaged it badly and it still works to this day.</li>
    <li> awesome shampoo and conditioner</li>
