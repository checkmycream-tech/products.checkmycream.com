      <li>A while ago I&#x27;ve purchased an awesome mineral powder foundation from one of the Etsy sellers</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best powder ever, my girlfriend told me.</li>
      <li>It was just perfect for my skin, perfect color and did give me a great coverage.</li>

      <li>This is a great powder.</li>
      <li>This is a great powder foundation.  </li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>I kept it and put it to great use and enjoyed a Flawless Face while it lasted  Satisfied ....</li>
      <li>but if you want something that covers &amp; feels good on your face, dont get this.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 20 and have always been struggling to find a good makeup routine...</li>
      <li>and I LOVED IT.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with MAC and will continue to use MAC makeup.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, beautiful</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>but the coverage is amazing.</li>
      <li>but you asked for honest feedback</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel as nice as the MAC I would purchase at Nordstroms</li>
      <li>Perfect and new, in the box and untouched.</li>
      <li>Love it! :-)</li>
      <li>it is very very light</li>
      <li>Although light when newly applied, but after a while it blends in with the skin colour and makes skin flawless</li>
      <li>MAC happens to be some of the best and affordable (as compared to Dior, Estee Lauder etc), that actually works and lasts on..</li>
      <li>and I like it more covering.</li>
      <li>All in all i love mac but strictly lips &amp; eyes</li>
      <li>then it looked in the beginning, but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give the flawless airbrush look that regular Mac makeup does.</li>
      <li>REALLY LOVE BUY USING</li>
      <li>I wasnt sure what color of the numbers i am...</li>
      <li>AUTHENtIC</li>
      <li>Dissapointed to receive my item and the makeup cake inside was flakey and flyaway,  not the consistency of authentic MAC Studiofix.</li>
      <li>and I have tried many brands.</li>
      <li>No breakouts, great coverage, and it shipped fast as well.</li>
      <li>I love Mac products, I meant to purchase NC30 Foundation Studio Tech</li>
      <li>I love MAC products.  </li>
      <li>, it does look authentic, even thought i would never buy it through amazon.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad with my purchase.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase and the whole purchasing experience from this vendor!</li>
      <li>but I saw this makeup tutorial and so far it&#x27;s been working great..</li>
      <li>I love Mac products especially all of your lip enhancing products it would be awesome if you could send me the right powder...</li>
      <li>What can I say other than this is the best powder I have ever used</li>
      <li>Also easy to find in any dept store that has a Mac counter, I just purchased on Amazon because I had a gift certificate.</li>
      <li>and it was to light for my complexion.....</li>
      <li>so i went with this one bcus its light</li>
      <li>came nicely packaged and not broken.</li>
      <li>I think the seller had MAC cases and put cheap cover-up in them.</li>
      <li>is way too light for my medium skin tone.</li>
      <li>I have been using this powder (I use for minimum to medium coverage), along with Smashbox primer, and it looks fabulous..</li>
      <li>Thus far, they love the product, which was delivered nicely wrapped and on time.</li>
      <li>One compact lasts me about ONE solid good year..</li>
      <li>It was supposed to be a neutral cool color</li>
      <li>But other then that, it has become apart of my makeup routine and is a great product.</li>
      <li>I ordered my MAC StudioFix Makeup from Lucky Girl Beauty and never recieved it.  </li>
      <li>(I like to be the first one to make a mark!)</li>
      <li>although this is pricey, it&#x27;s definately worth it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using MAC studiofix for many years, and I was able to instantly recognize that this was not the real thing.</li>
      <li>and I still have the box I didn&#x27;t want to return it because they didn&#x27;t want to have to admit my husband was right about buying make up on the internet</li>
      <li>unfortunately it is not the right color that was sent to me with the color choices that I went to it</li>
      <li>Shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>The product and shade were exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I was hesitant at first to buy this product because I&#x27;m prone to break outs when I use anything that has any liquid makeup in it,which  tends to clog my pores.</li>
      <li>The color turned out to be more yellow for my skin</li>
      <li>Pretty sure this isn&#x27;t actually mac-</li>
      <li>soemtimes when im in a hurry, i just use this powder, and it still covers up my flaws pretty well.</li>
      <li>And needless to say its perfect!</li>
      <li>but I shall pay better attention next time.</li>
      <li>This foundation/ powder is really nice, it provides full coverage without feeling heavy or looking cakey!</li>
      <li>Thanks for all your help.</li>
      <li>very sketchy...</li>
      <li>I really like the product</li>
      <li>This item was shipped very fast and came brand new.</li>
      <li>I use this and a concealer because of my redness...but other than that, I love it.</li>
      <li>I recommend it, but you want to be sure of the color if you are going to order it or any other makeup product.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend..</li>
      <li>No dents, no scrapes, brand new face powder.</li>
      <li>Ordered this very reliable face powder that I have used for a long time but never ordered online, and got exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I gave it 4 stars because the color was a bit light for me, so I definitely need to choose a darker color next time.</li>
      <li>So, Somehow when I placed my order I accidentally entered  &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; in the quantity field and ended up receiving TWO of this exact same powder compress.</li>
      <li>I wish it would be the same as my first product, so 4 stars here.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m giving it to you as far as other Mac products I love them all especially the lip glass.</li>
      <li>Mac Studio Fix is literally all I use as far as powders and foundations go.</li>
      <li>Actually I am a frequent buyer of MAC, in fact all my make up is from there, and I go to nordstroms to get it from mac, and i am a frequent buyer of studio fix and it does come with a sponge so from the picture</li>
      <li>I have fair skin that changes tone often depending my schedule with a hint of oiliness and was skeptical on choosing a shade.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very orange not worth the money it smells like baby powder and doesn&#x27;t cover much</li>
      <li>They are reasonably priced, and they last all day long on my face.  </li>
      <li>It makes my pores feel clogged, feels heavy on your skin &amp; i have had some breakouts using this which i rarely ever breakout.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for me, but still not perfect by far.</li>

    <li> Mac Studio Fix is literally all I use as far as powders and foundations go. It gives me great coverage and my skin looks flawless. Definitely a must in anyone&#x27;s cosmetic collection. Trust me, you&#x27;ll be hooked.  Also easy to find in any dept store that has a Mac counter, I just purchased on Amazon because I had a gift certificate.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 and have always been struggling to find a good makeup routine...my skin isn&#x27;t horrible, but I do get breakouts from time to time, and also dry skin, and well..regular skin problems..but I saw this makeup tutorial and so far it&#x27;s been working great..first i use a foundation base, then i use revlon photo ready makeup, then i use this powder! it turns out greatttt :D soemtimes when im in a hurry, i just use this powder, and it still covers up my flaws pretty well. although this is pricey, it&#x27;s definately worth it. i never spend too mucho money on makeup, but i&#x27;ll definately be buying this again!</li>
    <li> I ordered my MAC StudioFix Makeup from Lucky Girl Beauty and never recieved it.  I sent the seller 2 emails inquiring about the shipment, they never responded.  However, they did manage to charge me for it. The audacity of the seller.    I am so disappointed in Amazon.  I  trusted the merchants they enlisted. Be careful when ordering. Now I am in dispute with the charge an my account. It&#x27;s been a hassle!</li>
    <li> Actually I am a frequent buyer of MAC, in fact all my make up is from there, and I go to nordstroms to get it from mac, and i am a frequent buyer of studio fix and it does come with a sponge so from the picture, it does look authentic, even thought i would never buy it through amazon. very sketchy...</li>
    <li> My caregiver and her daughter specifically selected this item, thus I bought 2...one for each.  Thus far, they love the product, which was delivered nicely wrapped and on time.</li>
    <li> A while ago I&#x27;ve purchased an awesome mineral powder foundation from one of the Etsy sellers and I LOVED IT. It was just perfect for my skin, perfect color and did give me a great coverage. But that seller is no longer in business I think. So in my long searches to find a matching replacement I was sold this one. It&#x27;s ok for me, but still not perfect by far. It gives pretty thin coverage and I like it more covering. The color turned out to be more yellow for my skin then it looked in the beginning, but that&#x27;s OK. I wish it would be the same as my first product, so 4 stars here. Can anyone recommend compact mineral foundation that would give moderate coverage?</li>
    <li> NEVER EVER EVER does mac include an applicator in a product, let alone a sponge! DO NOT BUY, THIS IS NOT AUTHENtIC AND YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE, it could give you a reaction or rash!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using mac for a long time and this item was a total rip off. It was supposed to be a neutral cool color and it was orange! The same color I ALWAYS buy so there shouldn&#x27;t have been any suprises.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with my product, but the seller refunded my money without hassle even though it was out of their return policy. Would do business with again. Thanks for all your help.</li>
    <li> TOTALMENTE EN DESACUERDO AL COLOR QUE FIGURA, YO TENIA EL MISMO CODIGO Y ES UN TONO MUCHO MAS OSCURO AL QUE RECIBI. NO ESTOY DE ACUERDO CON EL PRODUCTO, MUY CLARO CON RESPECTO AL QUE YO YA TENIA SIENDO QUE LOS DOS SON EL MISMO CODIGO.</li>
    <li> Although light when newly applied, but after a while it blends in with the skin colour and makes skin flawless</li>
    <li> If you are looking for coverage &amp; nothing else than this is for you. but if you want something that covers &amp; feels good on your face, dont get this.  It makes my pores feel clogged, feels heavy on your skin &amp; i have had some breakouts using this which i rarely ever breakout. I have dry skin.  All in all i love mac but strictly lips &amp; eyes anything else i wont take my chances on suffocating my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M FROM BRAZIL AND IT&#x27;S REALLY EXPENSIVE TO BUY HERE...&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY LOVE BUY USING AMAZON.COM AND THIS STORES AND I WILL BUY ANOTHER ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS A LOT !!!</li>
    <li> I wasnt sure what color of the numbers i am... so i went with this one bcus its light but it came and it was actually really dark..</li>
    <li> So, Somehow when I placed my order I accidentally entered  &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; in the quantity field and ended up receiving TWO of this exact same powder compress. But, I wasn&#x27;t upset.  Too awful much ....I didn&#x27;t return it. I kept it and put it to great use and enjoyed a Flawless Face while it lasted  Satisfied ....</li>
    <li> This foundation/ powder is really nice, it provides full coverage without feeling heavy or looking cakey! It lasts all day too</li>
    <li> Ordered this very reliable face powder that I have used for a long time but never ordered online, and got exactly what I ordered. No dents, no scrapes, brand new face powder.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this was actually MAC foundation. I think the seller had MAC cases and put cheap cover-up in them. The applicator wasn&#x27;t even the same.</li>
    <li> Excellent product &amp; service</li>
    <li> I feel this was a knock off. It doesn&#x27;t feel as nice as the MAC I would purchase at Nordstroms</li>
    <li> This is a great powder. Covers everything!</li>
    <li> My wife swears by this product and we got it at a very good price so good deal all around</li>
    <li> The product and shade were exactly as described. Perfect and new, in the box and untouched. (I like to be the first one to make a mark!) Delivery was slated for 7-10 days, but I received my item the same week I ordered it. I am very pleased with my purchase and the whole purchasing experience from this vendor!</li>
    <li> Slamdunk with this product. I have fair skin that changes tone often depending my schedule with a hint of oiliness and was skeptical on choosing a shade. I am very pleased with MAC and will continue to use MAC makeup. I&#x27;ve recieved several compliments on my complexion while using this makeup.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I orderd a powder and recived foundation ... 😩</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best powder ever, my girlfriend told me. Easy to use, beautiful and she use it everyday! Just buy it!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Shipped very fast.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I really like the product unfortunately it is not the right color that was sent to me with the color choices that I went to it is way too light for my medium skin tone. it is very very light so I guess I will wear it in the winter time when I don&#x27;t have a tan unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it now. I love Mac products especially all of your lip enhancing products it would be awesome if you could send me the right powder...I have not used it but one time and I still have the box I didn&#x27;t want to return it because they didn&#x27;t want to have to admit my husband was right about buying make up on the internet lol but you asked for honest feedback and I&#x27;m giving it to you as far as other Mac products I love them all especially the lip glass. Thank you for the time Angela</li>
    <li> I use this and a concealer because of my redness...but other than that, I love it. and for an added bonus I spay on a makeup finisher so it lasts longer on me. came nicely packaged and not broken.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very orange not worth the money it smells like baby powder and doesn&#x27;t cover much</li>
    <li> Pretty sure this isn&#x27;t actually mac- wears and looks NOTHING like the fix I have bought at mac counters</li>
    <li> I love Mac products, I meant to purchase NC30 Foundation Studio Tech, I actually purchased this by accident and it was to light for my complexion.....but all was not lost my bff had NC 30 Foundation and she needed a lighter shade so we swapped. Not sure why the powder is so much lighter than the foundation but I shall pay better attention next time.</li>
    <li> Dissapointed to receive my item and the makeup cake inside was flakey and flyaway,  not the consistency of authentic MAC Studiofix. It also had a smell of Cosmetics such as covergirl.  I&#x27;ve been using MAC studiofix for many years, and I was able to instantly recognize that this was not the real thing. I ended up having to return this item.</li>
    <li> What can I say other than this is the best powder I have ever used and I have tried many brands. MAC happens to be some of the best and affordable (as compared to Dior, Estee Lauder etc), that actually works and lasts on..I have been using this powder (I use for minimum to medium coverage), along with Smashbox primer, and it looks fabulous..One compact lasts me about ONE solid good year..I highly recommend..</li>
    <li> Not Mac makeup, cheaper makeup in a Mac case. Doesn&#x27;t give the flawless airbrush look that regular Mac makeup does.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and service. I&#x27;m so glad with my purchase. Lo compre desde Venezuela y me llego muy rapido, estoy bastante satisfecho con mi compra</li>
    <li> This is a great powder foundation.  I love MAC products.  They are reasonably priced, and they last all day long on my face.  This is a great color and I know what NC30 looks like, that is why I purchased it online.  I recommend it, but you want to be sure of the color if you are going to order it or any other makeup product.</li>
    <li> This item was shipped very fast and came brand new.Love it! :-) i have never used this powder but the coverage is amazing.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant at first to buy this product because I&#x27;m prone to break outs when I use anything that has any liquid makeup in it,which  tends to clog my pores. But I bought it and crossed my fingers. And needless to say its perfect! No breakouts, great coverage, and it shipped fast as well. I gave it 4 stars because the color was a bit light for me, so I definitely need to choose a darker color next time. But other then that, it has become apart of my makeup routine and is a great product.</li>
