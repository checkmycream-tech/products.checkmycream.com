<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since February, 2015.  I really love the moisturizer.  It&#x27;s rich and it wears well under my makeup and I really see an improvement in my skin, especially in some deep lines by my eyebrows -- they really seem to have diminished!  I would suggest you give this product a try.  I will buy again and will make this a continued part of my skin regimen.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe this gets such great reviews - I saw no difference whatsoever - huge price - big scam.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she loves it</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very rich and goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> So nice! Just perks your face right up! Wonderfully moisturizes with out being greasy and heavy. My face just soaks it right up with an &amp;#34;ahhhhhhh&amp;#34;...</li>
    <li> I use this nightly. It is not heavy and greasy. It seems to leave my skin plumped by morning.</li>
    <li> The retinol cream was really gentle - I was a little nervous at first because my skin can be so sensitive, but I was able to use this consistently without issue. My skin feels soft and I do think I see a difference in my fine lines&lt;br /&gt;This product made my skin feel/look very soft and smooth after only the first use.My skin seems to look more refreshed.I love the design of the bottle and how easy it is to dispense.It went onto my skin very smoothly and absorbed quickly leaving no residue.It is very light textured and a small amount is all that you need to cover your entire face.I look forward to seeing what this product can do for my skin in the long run.I also have a few very tiny lines under my eyes that I would like to get rid of I&#x27;m hoping that using this along with drinking my daily water will eventually do the trick. I would definently recommend this to others that are interested in trying this Retinol Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion</li>
    <li> i am noticing professional grades are much more potent than regular and a tiny bit goes a long long way! not only do i love the fact there is a stopper on the actual inside of the product preventing it from spilling all over or being pumped but there clear packaging is easy to see if it was tampered with, it doesn&#x27;t look like much but i was told it took 5 years off of my face, shocking since i do not look my age now, added plus when i use my face mask to it, i couldn&#x27;t love this one anymore than i do! unbiased opinion of course! there normal retinol moisturizer was good but this one is top notch!</li>
    <li> Smoother skin almost right off of the bat. No breakouts. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and feels nice on the skin.  I&#x27;ve had no problem applying makeup over this product.  A smart buy for the price and I will buy again.  Great seller.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t made any difference to my skin other than make me breakout.</li>
    <li> I like this moisturizer.  It seems to be reducing my forehead wrinkles, which have been plaguing me more since I reached 36.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for a gentle night moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble with face products making me break out badly &amp; I&#x27;m turning 40 this year. It&#x27;s hard to fight break outs &amp; wrinkles. I ordered the Retinol Surge cream as the price was right &amp; retinol is a great wrinkle fighter &amp; Shouldn&#x27;t make me break out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for maybe a week. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement in wrinkle reduction, maybe because I also have to use acne products, but have seen a slight increase in wrinkles. I use the cream one time at night. I&#x27;m trying to reduce acne products so I can get more use out of the Retinol Moisturizer &amp; see what it can really do, but I&#x27;m still breaking out (stress). I&#x27;ll update this review in a month, but in the short time I&#x27;ve used it I haven&#x27;t seen results, which could be due to acne product usage. This vendor is very pro customer by the way, they really care if the products they sell are working, that is really awesome! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a moisturizer junkie. I try several products at a rapid pace, trying to find one that works. I was slightly leery since a previous product containing retinol seemed to dry me out, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this one did not. A small dollop does the job perfectly and it applies smoothly and absorbs quickly. After two weeks of use, I noticed that my dry patches and flaky skin had diminished greatly. I wasn&#x27;t having to pick large pieces of skin off before applying make up. It worked wonders and both I and my skin are very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a product free for review. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> This lotion irritated my skin and it broke out severely as a result. I had to visit my dermatologist as a result, which made this trial all too expensive. I did use the product as recommended, in small doses. I&#x27;m just disappointed I spent the money!</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first when I purchased, but a month after use and I have noticed my skin is super smooth and soft. I love this moisturizer. I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> Amazing product!  I saw a difference within 3 days.</li>
    <li> I bought this cream on the reviews, hesitant because I didn&#x27;t see much about the blemish aspect, and I do love it. I have had issues with acne my whole life. This is the first time, using a moisturizer that it not only cleared up my blemishes, but didn&#x27;t make me oily. I have very oily skin and have never been able to use moisturizers. I have only used this for almost 3 weeks, and already see a difference! Even with the &amp;quot;monthly&amp;quot; blemishes, didn&#x27;t even get one! So happy :)</li>
    <li> I have only used this product for a couple of weeks, but I do seem to notice a difference in skin tone and overall feel.  I believe this is one of the best moisturizers I have found.  I plan to also try the serum in the future.</li>
    <li> I just wanted to thank Body Merry for the awesome product. I recently purchased the retinol surge moisturizer and my skin has almost completely cleared up in 4 days. I have been suffering from mild adult acne for the past year and a half becasue my hormones have changed... I have been in and out of the derm and to multiple derms. All in all, I have seen 4 different derms totalling 8 visits in the past 18 months. Everything they prescribed burned, dried me out, and actually made my skin worse by irritation, I have sensitive skin. So last week as a teary eyed 32 year old with bad skin I took matters into my own hands and decided to try the retinol surge moisturizer since I didn&#x27;t think my skin could get any worse. I am so happy I could cry again for different reasons! This product almost completely cleared my complexion in 4 days. Now, I need to say I didn&#x27;t really have the large pimples you could pop. It was more those fine bumps all over that just look bad. I work out and I sweat a lot and it was mostly my forehead, jaw line and nasal fold area. Today is my 4th morning and I actually run to the bathroom to look at my skin. Thank you so much. I am back to me and I feel great!  I wish I found this product sooner. I have spent thousands the past year on my skin only to make it worse and this affordable lotion has been the most dramatic product I have tired. I had used epiduo with some success, however about a month after use my skin really started flaking and I ended up with chemical burn and backed off on application and broke out again. Epiduo also isn&#x27;t covered by insurance yet and it $350 a bottle. This non RX lotion works better and I can afford it each month. It doesn&#x27;t dry me out, It doesn&#x27;t make me oily, and there no burning sensation what so ever. I was a little nervous using a retinol product as they can sometimes make your skin worse before it gets better. This cleared me up unbelievably fast Thank you thank you Body Merry! Please don&#x27;t ever change the formula!la!</li>
    <li> Unlike most moisturizers I&#x27;ve tried, this one doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or my pores clogged. Nice, even texture. Might even be helping with a few acne scars. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This lotion is light weight and fragrance free and most importantly works better than anything I have ever tried. I&#x27;m a 45 year old male who works until exhaustion. Not only did this help diminish fine lines making me look youthful, it also softened a small chickenpox scar to he point it is softer and much harder to see. In fact in recent photos with family and friends my sister made the comment that she couldn&#x27;t even see it anymore. She&#x27;s convinced and will be ordering too. I love this stuff and hope its around for a long time.</li>
    <li> I have only been using the product a little over a month and really feel a difference. My face is smooth and soft. I have a glow, which I did not have before. Also have had many compliments that something good was different about my face. I think I&#x27;m going to love it! The owner said to give it 6-8 weeks to really see and feel a difference.</li>
    <li> I am very happy, so far.. It works very fast. I see the difference.</li>
    <li> Bought this my wife and she loved it...works great</li>
    <li> I will continue to reorder this moisturizer in the future. Not greasy and very smooth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this.  But after reading reviews I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  What a difference it&#x27;s made in my skin.  I have freckles and they&#x27;re stating to disappear!  The wrinkles around my eyes are diminishing.  The texture of my skins has greatly improved.  I have also been putting it on the top of my hands and noticed sunspots are disappearing.  I use it every other night and it seems to work great!  Will be a regular customer!</li>
    <li> Sadly but after several weeks of use, I see no changes in my skin. I&#x27;ll probably go back to the dermatologist because the prescribed Retin A formulas are stronger and I had more luck</li>
    <li> Love it! Affordable and works great.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any spots reduced but it feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I apply the hyaluronic acid first and my skin has improved a lot. Highly recommended, my mom also uses it and even though her skin type is different (oily) it has also worked out great for her. I love that it leaves the skin smooth without a heavy feeling on your skin. I will buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I really like this moisturizer. It clears my skin without over drying. I&#x27;m happy and will be reordering. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product religiously for almost a month with slowly visible results, and felt compelled to write a review. My skin is a bit more even toned and I think perhaps tighter. I noticed when accidentally reversing my iPhone to see myself - ugh - which I usually abhor because my face always looks so saggy and droopy looking down into the camera. It looked different this time and I actually wondered if the iPhone camera changed. Then I realized nothing had changed on my phone. It was a great moment. I still have wrinkles around my eyes, but they are thinner lines and not as &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; looking. I use this every night along with a very strong sunscreen during the day. I haven&#x27;t written an Amazon review before but felt this product deserved one. It really is a great product.</li>
    <li> I am really pleased with this moisturizer so far.  I have dry skin and no sensitivity and it&#x27;s a very effective moisturizer.  I ordered a serum from the same company and I&#x27;ve been using them together.  I had a couple of dry patches on my face from the cold weather, but they&#x27;ve disappeared and my skin feels more hydrated and firmer since using this.  I haven&#x27;t had much luck with the dew serum, but the customer service is phenomenal.  I received emails from the founder to check my satisfaction with the products and they are sending me the Pro-A serum to try with this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many moisturizers- from high end brands to the cheap drugstore ones and this is a great one to try for the price.  If you&#x27;re unsure, just try it.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was definitely excited to try this as I have loved the other products I&#x27;ve tried in Body Merry&#x27;s skincare line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I was pleasantly surprised at the size you receive (3.4oz). It comes in a pump form so you just easily press the top for your desired amount. It&#x27;s a very nice consistency and soaks in nicely leaving your face feeling moisturized but not greasy or sticky. It works well under makeup and also is great to use at night. I could see a difference in my skin after using several times. I have sensitive skin and this worked really well as I had no problems while using and love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals. I also had my mom try this moisturizer and she made a point to let me know that she liked it as well. This is something we would both consider purchasing again. I used this with the Body Merry eye serum and had great results! I recommend!&lt;br /&gt;I received the products mentioned above complimentary for testing purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Made using ingredients such as organic aloe vera, sunflower oil, derived hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil makes this moisturizer great. Retinol has been proven over the years to be very effective in the prevention and reduction of wrinkles. This moisturizer is light weight although the texture is rather thick. You need only to use less than a dime for your entire face and neck. If you have normal to oily skin this can be used both day and night. If you have more sensitive skin limit your use to either once day or night or even every other night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of the ingredients give your face a fresh and radiant look. I use this product only during the morning hours after cleansing, applying toner and serum. My face remains smooth through out the day and I have no issues with irritation as retinol can be a little bit of an issue for first time users. Another plus that I love for this moisturizer is that it is free from parabens, sulphates and is not tested on animals.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this moisturizer for a full month yet, but it has already made a huge difference in the appearance of crepiness on my neck. My face has a nice rosy glow too! This is a keeper for me and I highly recommend this Retinol Moisturizer, you can&#x27;t beat the price! I have tried other high priced brand names and have seen the improvement as I do with Body Merry. I don&#x27;t typically write reviews but I wanted to give my 2 cents to let folks know that this product truly works!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and was using a product for that and a separate moisturizer that worked okay, but this product does the job of both of these other products and does it better.  My skin is smoother and less dry and younger looking.  I love this product!</li>
    <li> My skin looks tighter and smoother. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it didn&#x27;t lighten my brown spots. Makeup glides on effortlessly.</li>
    <li> I love face products I must have at least 40 different creams, serums, scrubs, masks etc. I love most of them but Body Merry is a the top of my brands that I love.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to try their 2.5% retinol moisturizer in return for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product my face feels firmer and more supple, my skintone seems to be more even which is awesome. I also haven&#x27;t had any acne pop up since I started using this. It is a must try product!</li>
    <li> I was asked to try out they Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer . I did get this free for review , I have never used anything with retinol in it before , I used it as the instructions said , When I applied it to my face soon after it got very red , I am guessing it was the retinol in it , Not 100% positive but it didn&#x27;t like my face , So I have been using it on my neck and it is doing great , It is so smooth and putting it there dose not bother me at all , One bad thing I have found is the smell , Now don&#x27;t think because my face got red it would do the same to you I must have really sanative skin , I have let some friends try it as well and they love it , I will keep using this maybe try a smaller amount on my face and see how it works . But if you are looking for a good moisturizer this is a good one , This also helps with aging and making your sink feel and look younger , The formula does not contain any harsh chemicals such as Parabens, Sulphates or Phthalates. The moisturizer is made in the USA in an FDA registered and GMP compliant facility. It is not tested on animals.  So if you order this try a small area first before you put in on your whole face .</li>
    <li> After using this moisturizer for several weeks, I am very happy with it! As we age, our skin dries out, and splotches and wrinkles begin to appear. This product helps to prevent these from happening. It leaves a pleasant tingly sensation on your skin. I will definitely continue to use this product daily, and will recommend it to all my family and friends. I also like that the container gives you a decent amount for the price, so you don&#x27;t have to go broke trying to stay nice looking.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive, and acne prone skin. This moisturizer not only keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized throughout the day/night in this extremely dry and cold weather, but after using it for the past 10 weeks, my skin tone and texture has evened out tremendously and my skin has become more resilient to breakouts. There is virtually no scent and the product applies evenly and absorbs nicely.</li>
    <li> Product does not show any improvement in my skin !</li>
    <li> Amazing product, would recommend it to my friends!!! :)</li>
    <li> I like this for having no fragrance or smell. The consistency is not too thick or thin. Does not irritate. I like the pump container. Keeps the product clean.</li>
    <li> I have never used nor heard of Body Merry, but when I was able to review this moisturizer I was so excited! It&#x27;s getting to that cold time of year an my skin could really use some moisture! I really loved this product because it never made my skin feel dry or irratated like a product with Retinol normally would! I loved the smell very clean! Within days It made my skin feel so smooth and fresh, it took it longer to become dry throughout the day as we&#x27;ll!</li>
    <li> I have been using this Retinol Moisturizer for about 2 weeks I am really loving this moisturizer it hydrates my skin and makes you skin look so bright and clear The lotion feels so luxurious the formula helps give you a flawless tone and texture and leaves my face feeling smoother i recommend you trying this out its a great moisturizer i got this product to review and tell everyone my honest opinion</li>
    <li> I like it so far, though I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now. The pump on the bottle was unfortunately broken when I received the item but I was able to transfer the product into another container. So far so good.</li>
    <li> Love it so far after about six weeks.  Makes my skin feel smooth, maybe clearer skin.</li>
    <li> I notice less sagging/bags under my eyes and reduction in other lines. It is a subtle change and I hope it will improve further.</li>
    <li> I so love this. My skin has never looked so great. It has never felt so great either.  I thought i was going to have a bad reaction like some other products i have tried but it actually wasn&#x27;t bad at all.  Now it feels as if i had a peel done.  Love it great price.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a high quality retinol moisturizer. I received this to review and have seen really great results. I will admit, upon first using it my skin started peeling a little bit and I had to only use it once a day. However, now my skin has completely cleared up and my skin is looking even and awesome! This is a great cream!</li>
    <li> I bought this and another product at same time &amp; did a half face comparison - used this on the right side of my face.  Took a couple weeks and the improvement is addictive - it even lightened a spot on my cheekbone my dermo said was just an (eek!) aging spot.  I am 49, healthy &amp; very pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite moisturizer.  I use it day &amp; night and can see good results.  I don&#x27;t yet look 30 (I&#x27;m 67), so it&#x27;s definitely not the Fountain of Youth.  But you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  A little goes a long way so it lasts long.  What&#x27;s more, it&#x27;s a great value as compared to other products of its type.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks, but it seems like a nice moisturizer.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit too heavy to wear during the day under makeup, so I only use it at night.  ​I purchased it because of the natural ingredients, the high concentration of Retinol and the price.  I&#x27;d buy it again...it works well as a night cream.  I also purchased the hyaluronic acid serum and use that under my BB cream for daytime use.  The customer service from the vendor has been top notch.  My initial order had a leaking top and they immediately sent me another bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see any change in wrinkles, etc.., I&#x27;ll try to update in other 4 weeks or so to advise on that.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  Best retinol product used.  Great consistency and makes my skin so soft. The product is also a good size and great value.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I was looking for a stronger non-prescription night treatment after using some much more expensive lines at .5 and 1.0%. This one is a little stronger so I&#x27;m using it every other night but it is doing much the same that name brands accomplish. I am 55, with sun damage due to youthful tanning, and retinol helps me hold back the signs of damage, reducing dark spots. I religiously use sunscreen now, and this helps support/maintain the retinol improvements. I like that this is a larger size so I use it on my hands as well.</li>
    <li> It works really well. I mostly use it on my hands that are always so dry and it makes a huge difference. They are extremely soft now. Very happy so far</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  the jar is HUGE compared to most for the price.  It is very smooth, and does not irritate at all.  I have been using for a few weeks and love the results.</li>
    <li> Definitely notice a change on my skin. I use it once a day . My acne scars have minimized tremendously, skin is glowing, and everyone compliments how great it looks.</li>
    <li> I find this very satisfying, in that from the first day I used I saw a remarkable difference in my skin texture. I definitely will get it again.</li>
    <li> To their credit, they did refund my money. There was NO noticeable change using this product. It did not affect wrinkles at all. It made my skin greasy and did not absorb well. No tightening. No smooth look. Not one iota of an improvement. But at least they do honor the money back guarantee. That&#x27;s the only reason I was willing to try the product in the first place. Given the glowing reviews, either it&#x27;s a placebo effect, or people are grateful for ANY improvement... or perhaps it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I am mildly suspicious with the plethora of glowing reviews...</li>
    <li> You will not be disappointed!  I&#x27;m 28, nearing 29, and have decided it&#x27;s time to take control of my uneven skin tone and dryness.  I&#x27;ve tried different products, home remedies, etc, but nothing has helped with my uneven skin tone and mild rosacea on my cheeks.  After researching different ingredients and brands, I decided to give this a try and I&#x27;m soon happy I did.  First, the moisturizer goes on very smoothly and absorbs quickly.  I apply my powder foundation within about a minute after moisturizing.  After about a week I noticed less redness, especially after getting out of the shower.  My face used to be very red and uneven, and now after about a month of use, I can say it&#x27;s about 70-80% improved.  Someone actually said my face looked radiant the other day.  First time I&#x27;ve heard that! I also have a lot of dryness around my nose and between my eyebrows but I&#x27;ve noticed I no longer have to reapply anything other than this once daily.  I can go outside without makeup and not be concerned with redness and dryness.  If you&#x27;re looking for even skin tone and supple skin, I would certainly give this a try.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff, did wonders for my neck area.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this makes my face feel. I use it everyday. it is a great product</li>
    <li> Bought this product but pump does not work. I plan to contact the seller for a replacement</li>
    <li> Does what it says. I do like the stuff a lot!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several weeks now along with a serum that they also sent me for free* along with this product to try for free and review. By now I should start seeing a visible difference in my skin and I really am not. I have fine lines around my eyes and it has done nothing for those at all and my skin is still looking the same as it always has, just more moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still gave this three stars because it worked well as a lotion, absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry like I was worried about since it has retinol. It didn&#x27;t have any noticeable scent to it which is nice because it&#x27;s annoying when you use several products back to back that have strong smells that compete with each other, and I have allergies so sometimes I can&#x27;t use products due to their scents. I also have sensitive skin and this did not cause any kind of reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use bottle up as a moisturizer since it did work well for that. Hopefully with more time I will see a visible difference, but from my experience if I don&#x27;t see anything in the first few weeks I am not going to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting both this product and the serum for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 3 months now and really like the moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and was worried if I could use it. Not only has it helped with my skin breakouts, but I have noticed a remarkable reduction in pore size along my nose and on my chin. I apply it in the morning under my makeup and before going to bed. My skin has had no reaction and I just started my second bottle. Overall it is a great moisturizer for a great price.</li>
    <li> Love it, very gentle, absorbs quickly, light but moisturizing well!</li>
    <li> I have used several Retinol products on the market and have always find them disappointing because they&#x27;re very drying. This is BY FAR the best Retinol product I have ever used, besides it having retinol (what we ALL look for) its incredibly moisturizing with great ingredients for your skin, like green tea. Its truly a pleasure to use. Prior to this one, I was using Dr. Brandt $85 for 2% retinol and I hated it, it was drying. Now instead of using 2 products, I only need to use one product which includes everything a girl needs. Have no fear, I promise, you&#x27;re getting a great product. Thank you Body Merry for creating this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now....like 2 months. I have fair, dry skin and as a moisturizer it is great. However, it was to deliver better results. It isn&#x27;t bad enough to return it, but I doubt I will be buying it again. Didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Yes I love it so far. My skin looks radiant and healthy. I have used just about every product on the market. Never seen the results this fast.  What other products to you make. I am interested. Looking to hear from you. I would recommend to male and female.</li>
    <li> This Is my 2nd purchase of this cream. I&#x27;m very happy with the ingredients.</li>
    <li> All the Merry Products far exceeded my expectations.  I am 51 and avoid the sun completely.  Having worked for a dermatologist in the past, I also use Retin A religiously.  Since using the Merry Products, my husband even said my skin looks younger.  After all my years of paying a fortune for Strivectin, never once did he tell me that.  I am now a forever customer.</li>
    <li> Keeps my face soft and moist. I use it day and night</li>
    <li> Feels great, works great!</li>
    <li> Love the feel. Seems to really moisturize and not cause break outs. Very light.</li>
    <li> I suffer from dry skin, and during the winter months my skin tends to freak out even more. So of course I am always trying to find a product that will help my parched, flaky skin and bring it back to life. I have been using this one by Body Merry for close to a month now, and I feel like I can properly review it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have dry skin, I have used many types of moisturizers in the past, so I can easily compare it to my favorite tried and true products. I love the texture of this moisturizer. It isn&#x27;t too thick, but it&#x27;s not watery thin. It is the perfect happy medium. There is no scent to it which is nice for those who have sensitive skin. And it absorbs into the skin very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy slick residue. I have used this all over, and I have to say that I like it. It does moisturize well, and is something I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving a 4 star rating because while I like this one, I still have a few moisturizers that out perform this one. I find that when I use this moisturizer, especially on my face, I have to re-moisturize at least once throughout the day. During the winter months I like to have something where I can apply in the morning, and have it at work for me all day long. I think this one will be better for my skin in the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t so in need of major rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> This is my very first review ever n it&#x27;s bc I&#x27;m really impressed with this product,I also ordered the hyla...acid ,vit c with green tea ,bc of review someone suggested bc she uses it,thank you.I&#x27;ve only been using for 3 days no exaggeration,my chin dark spots fto acne n folliculitis is not bumpy as b4,texture is&lt;br /&gt;smoother,I&#x27;m going to keep using it n see how much better it will get.I only wish the hyla..acid serum was more,seem like it will dissipate fast.serum first,moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;after.Real nice.&lt;br /&gt;  IS</li>
    <li> I love my Body Merry moisturizer! All dermatologists agree retinol is key to more youthful skin. I have been looking for a retinol product that was natural, had enough retinol to do the job, moisturize my skin, and affordable. I live in a very dry climate and ski every weekend in the winter and my skin suffers terribly (not to mention I just turned 52, so I am also fighting the aging process)! The moisturizer is the perfect consistency...it&#x27;s not too heavy but not too watery/light. And what&#x27;s really amazing is my face is not drying out even when skiing! All of this and affordable! I will definitely keep buying this product!</li>
    <li> We received this cream a couple of weeks back and since then my husband has been using this cream. His face doesn&#x27;t have an even skin tone but the good thing is he keeps applying this moisturizer daily. I did not see much in the first week but in the 2nd week I was able to notice that his keeps getting softer everyday. He is applying it twice everyday after washing face thoroughly; morning and before going to bed. And his skin keeps better. Thanks to this cream.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this product works great for me. I use it behind a vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about a month so a little early for all the results, but it definitely seems to be working. Really noticing it in my neck.</li>
    <li> I love this product! My pores have disappeared and any breakouts are gone overnight.  My skin is firmer and wrinkles are fading somewhat.</li>
    <li> i really appreciate the moisturizer in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the other product i was using before this one did not have any moisturizer and my skin wasn&#x27;t happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry has a wonderful combination of a powerful retinol and a moisturizer that really works!</li>
    <li> This is the second time in roll that I bought this product. My skin is very sensitive specially around my eyes, it used to be a straggle trying to find a anti aging cream that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, this is the first product that is really doing good for my skin and not causing any irritation. Thank you for this product! :)</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Does not irritate skin at all. I&#x27;d use a salicylic acid soap bar during shower and then moisturize with this.  Takes about a week of using everyday to show marked improvement, so stick to it. I use the neutrogena medicated soap bar and then this Body Merry Retinol Moisturizer. Very happy after years of washing with salicylic soap and realizing I needed something that absorbs into the skin for the entire day.</li>
    <li> This works!  I&#x27;m 64yrs old and I&#x27;ve tried many products. Saw results 3-4 days, wish this would come in a &amp;#34;auto delivery&amp;#34; program. Hope they keep it at the price I paid, it works and affordable.</li>
    <li> i love it!! i like that the ingredients are clear and wolesome. the retinol level is clearly marked. it has a scent that does not intrude with everything else. ti works great!!</li>
    <li> this lotion is skin transforming, I have been looking for a product like this for years, thank you for creating it!</li>
    <li> Love, love love this product!  Saw results quickly and it is very reasonably priced!  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with Retinol Surge Moisturizer so far. I have only used it for two weeks and plan to reorder when I use it all. I want to give it enough time so that I can judge it fairly. I really like the way my skin feels even after just two weeks.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and at first it made my skin really dry. When I contacted the seller she suggested using it every other day and with the Hyaluronic serum along with an extra moisturizer. Now I have noticed a difference for the better. I will continue to use this along with other Body Merry products.  I&#x27;ve recommended to friends and family too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for3 weeks and I don&#x27;t notice any difference. Very disappointed in this product</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over one month now and have noticed a significant improvement in my skin. I did my research before purchasing the more expensive products and this one lives up to it&#x27;s promise at a much lower cost. I will continue with my new routine happily!</li>
    <li> Hard to find vegan face products that aren&#x27;t $$.  This feels very nice and keeps me from looking like death warmed over in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to believe in this product, but unfortunately it did nothing for my dark spots. I have several beauty marks (obviously those aren&#x27;t going anywhere) but I have lots of little dark spots on my cheekbones that showed no improvement after 1.5 months of continuous usage. I wasn&#x27;t looking for any miracles considering my Asian skin is prone to hyperpigmentation, but I&#x27;ve seen better results from less expensive brands. Although the cream felt and smelled great, I was disappointed considering the volume of positive reviews..</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic moisturizer with awesome ingredients. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate my face at all.  I have been looking for a retinol product with well thought out ingredients, that is effective, but not too harsh. FOUND!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product and will buy again.</li>
    <li> This cream is fantastic.  I have noticed a change already.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;women of a certain age&amp;#34; that have always taken care of my face, but, life does take it&#x27;s toll. This product has helped make my large pores appear less so, and has helped w/ the lines that run from nose to sides of mouth, marionette lines.</li>
    <li> I love the idea that this product is significantly stronger than most OTC retinol products, but I was a little afraid my skin might be too sensitive to such a high-grade amount of retinol. Until I tried it… When I used this, I thought for sure I would rash out or the retinol would dry out my skin. Not so much! In fact, it was surprisingly moisturizing and made my face feel super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I noticed the next morning that I had a few white heads come up and cleared as quickly as they came – possibly that my skin was 1) getting used to this product, or 2) the product was clearing out my pores. By the 3rd day, my chin had a little bit of a breakout. So I’m wondering if it is the combination of ingredients in this product that my chin just did not like. After a few more days of use, my chin cleared up – again, it’s possible that this product was extracting impurities in my pores. I don’t really know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I have lukewarm feelings for this product. I’m not sure I love it, but I don’t hate it. I was expecting a little bit more from a product that boasts a 2.5% retinol content. I’m going to have to say that Olay’s retinol product is still the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still on the hunt for something that focuses more on oily skin. Not bad though.</li>
    <li> not what i was hoping for saw no results</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have noticed the texture of my skin has improved to the eye and the touch.  I am very pleased so far, and looking forward to my future improvements!!</li>
    <li> I think this is my first review on Amazon, I write this only because the product is THAT GOOD that i feel obligated to share my thoughts with other women (and men) who are battling against signs of aging! In my job as pro athlete i have to look younger than my real age of 45. As of last year i really started to see the signs of spending thousands of hours in the sun and i didnt like it one bit. This product gave me back 7 years in appearance. Skin is way less saggy, uneven tone is mainly fixed, and fights further signs of melasma (uneven pigmentation of skin). I liked it so much i bought one for my good friend who is a 55 yr old pro fitness instructor and she too started to look younger in two weeks, and her wrinkles are slowly smoothing out.  I am now using this product for maybe 2.5 months (still on the same container it lasts that long - i use it 70% 2x/day and 30% 1x/day) and still seeing changes in my appearance. And a big thanks to all the other reviewers before me for your honest reviews so i was abled to discover this product too! (oh, and sorry for the fake name i&#x27;m using - a bit too famous to use my real one. :-) )</li>
    <li> Finally a product worth the price!!!!</li>
    <li> I read reviews on this moisturizer and decided to try it. I&#x27;m 60 years old and have a lot of sun damage. I&#x27;ve been using the retinol moisturizer and serum for three weeks now. My skin is much smoother and spots have faded a little. It&#x27;s only been a short time so I&#x27;m looking forward to see how my skin looks in another month!</li>
    <li> This has become my favorite all time moisturizer. Nicely packaged, clean, sanitary, pump dispenser.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Make sure to replace cap after each use.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.  I purchased two bottles, one for myself (65) and one for my daughter (30).  My skin is softer, smother and more even toned.  My daughter&#x27;s acne scars are fading and she has had compliments on her complexion.  We both will definitely continue to use this lotion and most definitely purchase it from Body Merry who delivered a product that lived up to their description, was delivered on time and followed up with me on my satisfaction with their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2+ years I&#x27;m still loving this product! Tried many and keep coming back to this moisturizer. Nice smell, smooth application, face and neck look great</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful. I have sensitive skin so was worried if it would cause any reactions, but I was pleasantly surprised that it did not. The cream is very luxurious and it soaks in well to my skin. I think my skin looks amazing after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer that has retinal, but does not irritate my skin.  This is the first product that really works.  I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product!</li>
    <li> My skin looks great after one week.  Cant wait to see how much better it gets over time.</li>
    <li> Great all natural product that leaves my skin very moisturized and soft. Not sure if it helps with fine lines though.</li>
    <li> Wonderful retinol moisturizer. This bottle is a nice size and you only need 1 or 2 pumps of the moisturizer and it covers the neck/face area. It will last a long time. It does not dry my skin and smooths out my wrinkles. I use this in conjunction with Body Merry&#x27;s retinol serum and my skin has never looked so good. Great product....will order again!</li>
    <li> Works well without irritation and the price is right!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product.  After only a few weeks my skin is noticeably softer and moister. I have had no reddening problems and use it twice a day. I also use any excess on my hands as the packaging suggests and find that beneficial, too.  Love this cream!</li>
    <li> I like the product very much. I haven&#x27;t noticed a great difference as yet. I have only been using it for about four weeks and as I understand it takes eight weeks or more to notice a bigger difference.  It is very smoothing to the skin (I am older so I do not expect it to remove the deeper wrinkles although it seems to be lessening the smaller one) and is certainly doing a comparable, if not better, job than the product I was using. It feels nice on my skin and it does soften the deeper wrinkles. I just placed another order and plan to continue to use the product. It does feel good on my skin and does soften the smaller wrinkles...so, I am assuming that it will, in time, work on the larger ones. Also, the customer service is very good and available for questions and refunds if needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been venturing into products that offer organic or close to organic ingredients. Some have been good while others not so good. This product is wonderful! I DO NOT LIKE to feel oily after applying a product and this moisturizer does do that. I feel moisturized without the oily feel. The price is comparable to other products out there and I feel like I am doing something better for my skin. I don&#x27;t think it is totally organic. It uses some organic ingredients but I am ultra hip on the whole organic deal so am just learning a few things. I do love the product and would recommend.</li>
    <li> Decent.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any benefit</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is very creamy.  As far as I can tell, it has helped the texture of my skin.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer and better than the prescription I have used for several years.  The cream  is quickly absorbed into the skin and, although I use another 2.5% retinol serum underneath, I have not experienced any redness or tenderness.  I will definitely reorder!!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have tried many, many retinol creams in all price ranges and brands. This is my favorite! I have been using for several weeks and my complexion is more clear and skin is brighter. I have sensitive skin too and this has caused any reaction.  Another plus is that my makeup goes in smoothly over it.</li>
    <li> such a great moisturizer. doesn&#x27;t feel harsh on my skin like others I&#x27;ve experienced and although I did receive this product free to review these are my honest opinions on the retinol moisturizer. This product goes really great with their body merry Hyaluronic Acid Serum product which I am currently using together and I am having amazing results.</li>
    <li> Works great! I&#x27;m using it in a face plumping mask with manuka honey and a pinch of turmeric :)</li>
    <li> Since using Body Merry Retinol Moisturizer, my skin has never looked better. Love this product!</li>
    <li> Great product! I think it is making my skin look smoother after a few weeks of use. Will order again.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on nice. I use it in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> Product came by delivery date. I&#x27;m very pleased. My skin is moisturized, smooth, and hydrated. Good product, good value.</li>
    <li> Nice product that goes on like silk.  Just started using....so can&#x27;t wait to see results in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about this product. I purchased it because of the god reviews, but I can tell you that it doesn&#x27;t mousturize my face very well. The skin texture looks snake like compared to the moisturizing effect that I get from CVS $10 lotion</li>
    <li> Product seems ok but can&#x27;t see any real difference in my skin except it feels very smooth.</li>
    <li> I have &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; sensitive skin and am allergic to perfume. I have found this product to be a wonderful moisturizer with retinol that goes on smoothly and has no irritating perfume. I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have only used this for a short time, but have already seen some results in my skin.  Will continue using it.  If I could only use only one product on my face, I would probably make this my only one.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really think it is as claims, I have used 5% retinol, &amp; I can feel a vey slight burn, I don&#x27;t feel that at all when I use this. This is supposed to have 2.%????</li>
    <li> Product arrived when promised and i started us in it the first night. This is one of the only moisturizers i have used that is actually absorbed by my skin. So far, i love it and can&#x27;t wait to see the benefits in the next week or so.</li>
    <li> I use twice a day. it didn&#x27;t bother my skin. I have only used for a few weeks so it&#x27;s still to early for any results</li>
    <li> This is a really great moisturizer.  I have only been using it for about 6 days and have noticed the retinol working without my skin drying too much.  So far, I am super happy.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my face really smooth and supple</li>
    <li> great product! great results!</li>
    <li> Have really enjoyed this moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin oily. Sometimes I get a little dry, but nothing bad. I have very sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.I love the price.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff! I was out for a while and missed it so much I will order ahead from now on. It has made a huge difference in my skin. The bottle looks black in the picture and that confused me as it is actually a deep reddish colored bottle. This stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in gold!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product a while back and it has been working great ever since. I had pretty bad acne, and thought it might be from my sensitive skin being dried out. I began using this and within days my skin looked so much better. The price is great for what you&#x27;re getting. Customer service was wonderful. The first bottle I received had an issue with the pump being cracked inside from shipping, and they sent me a free bottle no questions asked. I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer feels so nice on my skin. It is creamy but blends in nicely with no sticky after feel.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly is not heavily fragranced.  After using it for a couple weeks my skin feels softer and looks more even. I am excited to see the results of continued use. I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have used many face creams over the years and I&#x27;ve finally found a company that I love. These Body Merry products really work! I can see a difference in my skin and during my last facial, my technician remarked at how soft and moist my skin is for a woman of my age (60ish). When I told her some of the ingredients in the Body Merry creams, she said that is exactly the kind of product she recommends to her clients.  The bottom line is this product line really works and it is a bargain. Why pay exorbitant prices for fancy creams when you can get such an excellent product here? On top of that they have terrific customer service.</li>
    <li> Great really nicely surprised. Not quite the fountain of youth but it helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Body Merry Retinol  Surge Moisturizer for about a month. I am using it weekly at nights. I have fair/sensitive skin and did not want my face to get all wonky.  I apply sunblock in the mornings to my face as well.  I have noticed the fine lines around my eyes begin to disappear. My face feels softer than it has in years. I really like the personal contact I received from the Body Merry company. I am happy with my purchase and will purchase this Retinol Surge Moisturizer again. The price does not break the bank which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of Subscribe and Save purchases, maybe some time down the road this product will be available as such?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product that we can afford.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  I love the way goes on and is absorbed into the skin.  Just now seeing the signs of the Retinol after several weeks of use.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after continued use.</li>
    <li> Love love love this! Just what I needed.</li>
    <li> Great product, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or sticking feeling. Will see better results with time. So far I have loved all products purchased from this company.</li>
    <li> After one month skin texture is smoother and has a glow but no change in wrinkles yet-perhaps too soon.</li>
    <li> i only bought this to try it cus of the rating/reviews. My personal opinion it didnt do anything for me. I gave it 4 months before writing my review. i am an asian female in my late 30s w wrinkles, age spot...did NOT do anything for any of these issues</li>
    <li> This moisturizer was exactly what I was looking for.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, absorbs quickly, has no odor, and is not greasy.  The pump dispenser is ideal as I can control the exact amount coming out and I&#x27;m not rolling the end of a tube and squirting out too much.  Also, for the price, they give you a generous amount of product.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and customer service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find great skin care products, and this was my second go with Body Merry. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
    <li> feels good on skin, really like it and will order again, priced good for the product</li>
    <li> I have definitely seen a difference in my eye area (my target area) since i began using this. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have normal to oily skin, and a mature skin.  This moisturizer feels great on my skin, not greasy but I can see the difference after putting it on.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product, because it works and doesn&#x27;t break your pocketbook.  I use to buy expensive skincare products that semi-work, this moisturizer truly works and I am anxious to try more of her products.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a little while...So far, I have had good results, but I have not been using this for a great deal of time, so I haven&#x27;t had the chance to see long term effects yet.  I will continue to use Body Merry...So far, so good!</li>
    <li> Not a doctor, not even close. But as far as retinol is concerned, seems they are all from the same source and converted to the active skin aiding supplement. Only difference I was able to google, between prescription and non, is the active percentage, No adverse effects, acne or anything like that. Skin appears softer not sure about wrinkle reduction. Been using it for about a month. For $20, if nothing else you have a moisturizer that will last at least 2 months at 1 application a day.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer! Does real well with my dry/oily skin. Shrinks pores and makes my skin look great.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try-you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Great cream! Not irritating, not oily or greasy, just feels like it is moisturizing. Fine lines have improved and dark spots are lighter. I have only used this for a few weeks. I am very pleased and I would order again. I have used it to replace a $200 cream and am VERY satisfied! Outstanding customer service.</li>
    <li> Received this a couple of days ago so Ive only used a few times but this goes on nicely and doesnt have a strong smell.  Absorbs quickly. Looking forward to seeing the results!</li>
    <li> I literally saw results the morning after the first nights application. Skin clearer, acne scars less obvious. Will be making this a normal part of my nightly regimen. Great.</li>
    <li> Excellent results and great price!</li>
    <li> I have used this product daily for 3 weeks. While it is a fine moisterizer, I do not see any immediate results. In fact, I ended up having a chemical peel which was far more satisfying. I would rather pay for the chemical peel monthly, than a high dollar moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite facial moisturizer. I have used better. My skin is very dry and I do not feel like it gives me enough moisture through the day.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews before I decided to give this a try and I am so glad I did.  I have been using Retinol Surge for more than a month and I must say this product REALLY does what it says.  I use it only at night but my sensitive skin is softer, more moisturized and looks, dare I say, beaming :)  I had to see my Dermatologist the other day for a procedure and he even commented on how soft and clear my skin is.  Being over 50, I loved hearing that.  I will definitely continue using this product until its no longer marketed, so PLEASE don&#x27;t ever change the formula.  I am ordering another one to ensure I never run out.  I can&#x27;t even imagine how great my face &amp; neck will look after long term usage; but I definitely intend to find out :)</li>
    <li> This is truly a 5 star moisturizer. I have tried other retinol containing moisturizers in the past, but they make my skin incredibly dry. I use this every not after cleansing and using toner and serum and my face feels supple and soft in the morning when I wake up. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy or heavy. Make sure to use sunscreen during the day when using this product.</li>
    <li> It started giving  me a rash after a couple of uses. Product arrived quickly though; so yes to seller no to product.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using a retinol moisturizer.  I was delighted with a letter from the CEO who gave me detailed instructions on how to use the product and provided contact information should I have questions or concerns.  Extraordinary customer relations!!!!!  Thank you for your impeccable follow up and care!  I am eager to provide further details in a few weeks of using your product.  Thank YOU!</li>
    <li> I do see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research before I bought the Body Merry Retinol Moisturizer.  I was impressed by all the reviews, so I ordered my first bottle.  Previously, I was using Clinique&#x27;s serum which was about $50 per bottle.  It did a good job of smoothing my skin, but I still had dark spots that didn&#x27;t quite fade.  Right away, I loved the feel of my skin after using Body Merry for a couple of days.  After using for a month, I felt convinced that this worked as well  if not better than the more expensive Clinique product.  All of my friends talk about how young I look.  A big part of that is genetics, but I like having this product in my arsenal for minimizing fine lines and evening skin tone.  This is a great product fom a great company. My hubby bought me a groupon for a facial.  I went to the salon (my first ever). and the aesthetician asked what I used, then looked up the ingredients, and wrote down the name.  She said that the ingredients were wonderful and that she was going to look into the products for herself!</li>
    <li> Fine lines disappear!  Soaks right in &amp; don&#x27;t have to reapply a second application like with other products.  Will buy this again</li>
    <li> Although I have only used for a short time, I can say I&#x27;m seeing results. The cream goes on smooth as silk, absorbed quickly and seems to be doing it&#x27;s job. Now, I&#x27;m a 60+  women with a few wrinkles. I stay out of the sun. I bought this for the retinol %  and natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and really like it! I use it every night and am very pleased!</li>
    <li> My skin is so sensitive it&#x27;s scary. Also, I have dermatitis, so I&#x27;m always a bit afraid of new skin products, and, needless to say, I haven&#x27;t been able to find many anti-aging products I can use - most of them actually make my skin condition worse. So This product was a very pleasant surprise. I have been using it daily for the past couple of weeks and - my skin actually did get better! I was told retinol would be too strong for my skin, but hey, this Body Merry product is working pretty good so far. And yes, I am a guy, I&#x27;m 34 and I have the right to be concerned about my skin, so after reading dozens of reviews I decided to give this product a try and I&#x27;m happy I did. Will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> Very impressed. I just ordered 2 more products from this company to try. Great price and it does what it says - my skin looks great.</li>
    <li> I have given this product four months and it&#x27;s horrible.  I break out and there&#x27;s no improvement with my fine lines.</li>
    <li> This is hands down one of the best moisturizers I have ever used.  I have really sensitive skin and this works great for me!  Also, it is fantastic to see smaller companies put out such high quality products!</li>
    <li> Thankfully I dodged being a sucker on this one. Please everybody do yourself a favor and do not fall for the scam pedaled by Body Merry, TruSkin Naturals, Christina Moss Naturals, OZ Naturals, Body Naturals, Radha Beauty, or whatever other company these counterfeits are calling themselves. If you take a read through any of the reviews, descriptions or &amp;#34;ingredients&amp;#34; for any of these companies products, you will notice similarities just like I did. Every product offered by these companies, which I&#x27;ve counted about 15 so far, have almost identical % ratios .... typically about 85% rated either a 4 or 5 star, about 5 to 10% rated a 3 star, and 1 to 4 % rated a 1 and 2 star. I don&#x27;t care who this company is, NO ONE gets that good of stats on ALL of their products, let alone 15 different companies with 5 products each. I buy soooo much stuff online and I have NEVER written a review before, I always thought that that was everybody elses job, those who like writing reviews.  But I finally had to make my words known so other people don&#x27;t have to get ripped off, taken advantage of, or break out in hives or rashes from using their products. Please spread the word that these products do not work and that all of their jacked-up reviews are padded. Look at the stats yourself if you don&#x27;t believe me, all of the products have an overall star rating of 4.5 to 5, and that is with 300 - 1300 reviews each. Please don&#x27;t order any of their snake oil.  Amazon you should be ashamed of yourself for allowing this, especially since you&#x27;re the one shipping these products. And to all those customers who let yourself be bought for a good review, YOU&#x27;RE RUINING THE SYSTEM FOR THE REST OF US!</li>
    <li> Good delivery , as it was promissed, Thanks</li>
    <li> Been using it for about 4 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen much change in my skin.  However, hydrating yes.  Still waiting to see the results others claim they have experienced</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only product I&#x27;ve been able to use without in making me break out. It leaves my skin soft, though I have been only using it for the last three weeks, I do see a difference. We&#x27;ll see what my skin looks like in three months.</li>
    <li> Loved this retinol! I have very sensitive skin but it didn&#x27;t cause any redness. I used it twice a week and noticed that my skin became firmer, fine lines were less visible and old acne scars started to fade. I love this company! I have also tried their cellulite cream and I LOVE it! Excellent products, excellent customer service!</li>
    <li> Love the way this cream feels on my face. I&#x27;ve seen a little wrinkle improvement within the first month.</li>
    <li> It works, and it actually works well. I&#x27;m a male - mid 40s, and I tried it just for the heck of it since I&#x27;m going to all of the trouble to lift weights and get in shape these days.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I&#x27;m embarrassed to say, as a macho man, I bought this stuff, not for my wife, but for myself.  I use it twice a day every day (after a nice close shave). Makes a noticeable difference in reducing lines. I don&#x27;t use anything else except standard soap and shaving cream on my face. Shower / wash face / shave (with razor) / dry off / put this stuff on. Go about my day. Repeat in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;It took about 2 weeks to really notice a difference, but I did notice a difference, and still do. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Dear Team Amazon,&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because of your awesome reviews, but I stopped using it after my skin began to look more dull and I broke out a bit.  For me I think it was the green tea in it since nothing in my body likes caffeine.  I went back to my neutorgena and my skin is looking brighter again and breakouts are gone.  I&#x27;ll give it to a friend as it may work wonders for them, I&#x27;ll update if it does or does not.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer.  Makes my skin feel smooth and firmer than normal.  So glad I tried it!</li>
    <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? As a regular tester, I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Virtually none&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Like a nice medium-weight moisturizing lotion. Not oily, but certainly emollient.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: My VERY sensitive skin feels a very slight warmth, but nothing close to the unpleasant experience I’ve had with some other retinol creams. Running fingers across skin, you can feel it, halfway between oily and sticky, but neither. This isn’t the unpleasant film some lotions leave, and the skin feels moisturized. This DID irritate my eyes when I applied a little too close to them and later rubbed my eyes. Keep away from eyes actually applies here.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: I think it should be fine for all of them.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 3.4oz broad pump-top plastic bottle with cap. The pump is precise and easy to use. Bottle size is generous enough to use on hands and neck as well as face. Note that mine had a pink label, not the black shown in current photos.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* If your skin was a bit in need of a moisturizer, this will brighten it up and reduce the appearance of fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Retinol is a superb anti-aging ingredient and will absolutely make your skin look better. My problem has always been finding a retinol cream that wasn’t sticky and didn’t flush my skin, so I’m very happy with this one. Hyaluronic acid is another good long-term ingredient, and the moisturizers (aloe, shea butter, and glycerin) in it are good. If you don’t yet use a retinol cream, you are missing something and this would be a good one to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support).

    <li> I have fallen in love with this product!  I will continue to purchase this product because I noticed&lt;br /&gt;immediate results!!!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks...I like it and I see changes in my skin...more of a glow and evenness...It does smell kind of funny but it is worth it!. I would recommend</li>
    <li> Looking forward to good results!  Feels good on the skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks, and my skin has improved. I recently had a facial, and my esthetician explained that the stubborn clogged pores on my upper cheeks were something called milia. And essentially, I need to increase exfoliation to prevent them from coming back. This cream is better than the retinol you get from the dermatologist because it is gentler. I had a very small amount of peeling on the bottom of my chin when I started using it, but I use it twice a day. Be sure to also use a good sin block, because it does contain retinol which will make your skin more sensitive to sun damage. I got a discount on this product to try it and share my feedback, but it was a very timely change up in my skin career routine. I think my skin was getting tolerant/accustomed to the products I was using, and I needed to shake things up a bit.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 4 months and have not seen any difference in my skin.  I am highly doubtful that it contains that much retinol. will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I like using this moisturizer, I have combination skin and it&#x27;s hard to find products that don&#x27;t cause breakouts or dryness. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve seen any difference in my skin, but I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is on par with other moisturizers that are similar to it. However, Body Merry is a great company that stands behind it&#x27;s products so if you are looking to try this kind of product you can not lose by purchasing from them.</li>
    <li> I have small neck wrinkles that were beginning to annoy me. I purchased this product 2 weeks ago, and I have seen a noticeable difference in both the texture of my skin and the wrinkles are less apparent. I am a very skeptical consumer, the only thing that has ever worked on my wrinkles has been little botox injections now and again; however, this really does work on small fine lines. I will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great Retinol Moisturizer. I am 51 years young with dry skin and sun damage. I have a difficult time finding a night cream that leaves my skin feeling soft &amp; hydrated the next morning. This one does that. I use this morning and evening with a Vitamin C &amp; Retinol serum and it works great, I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Seems to have made a small difference in the wrinkles in my neck.</li>
    <li> Body Merry has been a guest over here in the past and always welcomed! Like you don&#x27;t need to call before you arrive type of guest :) and it&#x27;s because I really enjoy using their products. They work and who doesn&#x27;t like using stuff that shows results because my beauty regimen is not just for fun......I&#x27;m sort of on the run from the tick-tock clock of time. I enjoy the memories with people and experiences, just don&#x27;t wrinkle me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent Body Merry&#x27;s Retinol Surge Moisturizer. It&#x27;s an all-in-one product that can be used by itself as a last layer application or you can amp your routine by using a serum and then a thin layer of Body Merry&#x27;s Surge Moisturizer. The product offers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.5% Retinol in a cream form&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin B5&lt;br /&gt;Green Tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower Oil, Palm Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Tocopheryl (Vitamin E), Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Wildcrafted Propolis, Shea Butter, Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer really covers everything from giving you an instant boost from the green tea, uses Aloe Vera versus water as it&#x27;s base and you have nourishing agents like Shea Butter, Jojoba oil and Vitamin E. Body Merry goes one step further by making sure their Hyaluronic acid is derived from plants and let us not forget the major player here, the 2.5% percentage of retinol. The product is all packed in a pump action bottle, so no air, light or even bacteria can easily come in contact. That to me is insurance on your purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:&lt;br /&gt;A one pump serving was enough for me to cover the areas I wanted to treat on my face because I have combination skin and that means some areas get more moisturizer than others. I then had enough to treat my neck and chest area because people tend to over focus on the face when the rest of your body can also show aging. I applied the product under make-up and never had issues of my foundation not looking right hours later or even problems with blending. The acids in the moisturizer keep everything in check. Make sure to use SPF (even though you should already be) because retinol products may make skin sensitive to the sun, plus why damage the skin you are trying to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Like with all of Body Merry&#x27;s products so far, I am happy with the results and the price point. I got tired of OTC products not declaring the percentage of retinol in their products and just taking their word that there was even a significant amount to make a difference. I might as well squeeze a bottle down the sink if it&#x27;s not going to work! With Body Merry products, everything is forthcoming and no proprietary blends to hide behind. Body Merry tells you what you are getting, how it&#x27;s going to work and what to expect, plus goes beyond and adds a satisfaction guarantee. No hassles and I like exchanges like that because the beauty world should not be complicated. We all want to look our best, we all can&#x27;t afford and/or don&#x27;t want to undergo surgery, so we just want stuff that works. Body Merry&#x27;s stuff works and that is something I (and my skin) truly appreciates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Body Merry.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.ore moisturizer than others.

Make sure to use SPF (even though you should already be) because retinol products may make skin sensitive to the sun, plus why damage the skin you are trying to take care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;Like with all of Body Merry&#x27;s products so far, I am happy with the results and the price point. I got tired of OTC products not declaring the percentage of retinol in their products and just taking their word that there was even a significant amount to make a difference. I might as well squeeze a bottle down the sink if it&#x27;s not going to work! With Body Merry products, everything is forthcoming and no proprietary blends to hide behind. Body Merry tells you what you are getting, how it&#x27;s going to work and what to expect, plus goes beyond and adds a satisfaction guarantee. No hassles and I like exchanges like that because the beauty world should not be complicated. We all want to look our best, we all can&#x27;t afford and/or don&#x27;t want to undergo surgery, so we just want stuff that works. Body Merry&#x27;s stuff works and that is something I (and my skin) truly appreciates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Body Merry.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.</li>
    <li> use this on my neck in conjunction with the neck firming cream, and *poof* ! my age rings have greatly diminished!! hope the eye cream does the same for my under eye crinkles and crows feet! will update later!</li>
    <li> Perfect moisturizer. Smoother, softer skin; no skin reactions, and maybe my wrinkles are not quite so defined. I&#x27;m glad to have found Body Merry products through Amazon. All ingredients listed. Made in the USA.</li>
    <li> Help reduce look of aging skin, I have sensitive skin so have to be careful</li>
    <li> I love the moisturizer!  Referred by my sister and is already evening out my skin tone.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Equally effective without the irritation and redness of prescription formulations...</li>
    <li> I am writing this non-biased review in lieu of getting this item at a reduced cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent this to my mom and she loves it!  She has used other cremes and moisturizer&#x27;s in the past and has spent over $100+&lt;br /&gt;and this does the trick for a whole lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended! 5/5</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer! I use this in conjunction with the Vitamin C moisturizer and love them both!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for a reason other than wrinkles. I&#x27;m almost 30 and about a year ago I started suffering from very bad acne on my face and upper body. I have probably spent over $500 on OTC acne products trying to find one that works. I even tried an acne antibiotic with no luck. I thought this had something to do with moving close to a train station, as there is deisel fuel sut all over the windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop wasting money on cheap stuff and did some research on retinol. I took the plunge and ordered this as well as the ROC Retinol face cleansing discs. I tried it for the first time last night, so I tried the two in combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning wth the smoothest skin I&#x27;ve ever had. My pores were smaller. It didn&#x27;t do much for the two larger preexisting pimples I had, though the were noticeably less raised and less red. The small newer acne on my forehead was gone around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update when I&#x27;ve tried this for longer, but after one use in combination with the ROC product, I&#x27;m enthralled with the results. My skin is already looking wide awake, so whatever this magical formula is, I wish I hadn&#x27;t been so cheap for so long and just taken the dip into my bank account and gotten this to begin with.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! Skin feels great. Nozzle is amazing. Easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t dry up! Great customer service. All I want is gentle acid in a bottle that is easy to use...this delivers and then some.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy Body Merry Products. They make my skin feel youthful. While I&#x27;m not seeing drastic changes in my skin, it feels healthy and thats what&#x27;s important to me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after appreciating the results of its sister eye cream. At first, I started to break out, but I&#x27;m glad I let it run its course. It makes my skin look healthier and I have no adverse effects applying additional moisturizer with sunscreen on top of it (after I let it absorb into my skin for several minutes). Retinol makes your skin more sensitive to sun, so spf is a must. I do wish this had it, but I&#x27;m glad I can apply it on top of it without changing its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> This is non greasy and makes my face feel very smooth.  When I travel I usually use just a carry on.  Since its 3.4oz I can&#x27;t take it with me.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is truly amazing.  I love how smooth and soft my skin feels after using it now for a few weeks.  There definitely is a glow and a plumpness that wasn&#x27;t there before. The 2.5% retinol is also a huge plus.  I&#x27;ve been using a 1% retinol product from the drugstore and it was fine.  This is clearly better though ... and it must be the 1% vs. 2.5%.  I don&#x27;t know exactly, but I&#x27;m super happy. Also, absolutely no redness from the increased retinol.  Nothing.  Just clear, wonderful skin!  I am now a huge fan and will continue with this product indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I have been using retinol products off and on for a while and was anxious to give this one a try.  It is a FABULOUS product and the ingredients have had a noticeable and beautiful effect on my dry and mature skin.  My skin is noticeablly smoother and brighter with fewer wrinkles!  I use it at night as  I have very dry skin.  You don&#x27;t need much, so its generous size of 3.4 ounces will last quite a while.  I also ensure that I use it on my hands and neck/chest area to hold back the aging process.  It&#x27;s working!  Give this one a try; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wife says this is the best product on the market. Very competitively priced product. Uses it daily in her skin care routine.</li>
    <li> I usually am a little hesitant to try a new face creams and serums because they all say they can decrease fine lines and wrinkles,  give your skin a brighter glow, leave it permanently smooth, etc but most rarely can, or of they do, the effects are only temporary.&lt;br /&gt;Also, most creams/serums ingredient lists confuse me as they are all scientific chemical names. I try to look for specific ingredients when choosing a cream or go with something recommended to me by friends and family members.&lt;br /&gt;I have been lucky to try other Body Merry products recently and loved them, and now trust this brand and it&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I started to use #BodyMerry Retinol Surge Cream in the evening, after my shower or bath, or at night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;I would rub it in, moving my hands in a small, swirling motion. I did notice that my skin was smoother after over a week and not only that but my skin tone was better and more clear. I definitely see a lasting difference. I will admit, that I forgot to use it a couple times but then I would just use it in the morning before applying my makeup. This opinion is my own unbiased opinion even though I got this product free from a product trial from Tomoson.</li>
    <li> Good product after using for a week the result is as other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Love the moisturizer. Have used it for a couple of weeks now and can see improvement. Will definitely continue use. Good product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Body Merry products for a couple of years now. Each new product seems better than the last. This one is a professional GRADE retinol moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Starting with the bottle, this is a large bottle 3.4 ounces worth! Nice easy pump bottle. I pump of moisturizer does my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone knows that retinol, has proven itself to be a potent anti-aging ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;This unique formulation gives me all the benefits and none of the dryness or irritation that is typically associated with the use of Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion itself is white and about a medium consistency. The Retinol Surge Moisturizer has no scent at all. Like other Body Merry products this one is light and absorbs quickly. Retinol Surge Moisturizer doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky or greasy. Wearing makeup over this moisturizer is great also because my make seems to glide on even better!&lt;br /&gt;I use this Retinol Surge Moisturizer at night before bed. I’m LOVING the glow I wake up with!! So it’s not only great for nighttime but it’s also one of those moisturizers that works great under makeup; plumping fine lines and smoothing out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love that this is a natural &amp; organic moisturizer with no fragrances or alcohol. Added bonus is that this is made here in the USA and never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;So, once again I&#x27;m impressed!! My skin feels great. My skin looks great!! Best of all this Retinol Surge Moisturizer is lightening my age spots!! What could I possibly whine about there?!!?&lt;br /&gt;I have received complimentary/free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far. I have only used it a few days but my skin feels great, it&#x27;s not over moisturizing and it hasn&#x27;t made me breakout or made my skin sensitive. I only gave it 4 starts b/c I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say I LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about a month and I really like it! I just told my sister she should by it. I have oily/acne prone skin, but have not noticed any issues. My neck especially seems to look improved. I will definitely be buying again. Wonderful and friendly customer service!</li>
    <li> I received this at a great discount to review. I&#x27;m not sure about this one. It goes on nice but I&#x27;m not really seeing much of a difference. I&#x27;ll use up the whole bottle and see if that does anything.</li>
    <li> My face broke out right away</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin so this is a godsend. just started using it a few days ago so all I can comment on is that it is a good moisterizer for oily skin.</li>
    <li> I am 64 years old, and have taken relatively good care of my skin - have always used moisturisers and sunblock, but age inevitably catches up with you.  My skin tone has become uneven, and, let&#x27;s face it, I have wrinkles.  This product is supposed to reduce wrinkles, so I tried it.  I have been using it for about 6 months, and I have noticed some improvement in skin tone and elasticity, but no measurable change in wrinkles.  Let&#x27;s face it, there are no miracles in jars for old age, and, as I did not expect a miracle, I was not terribly disappointed.  I think it is somewhat more effective for improving skin appearance than the products one buys at the grocery store, so I think I will continue to use it.  But I think that it would be easy for many to conclude it is not worth the relatively high price tag.</li>
    <li> My husband and I started using the hyaluronic serum, and we loved it. The seller offered a free trial, so we decided to try it. The result was amazing that we are going to purchase the second one. Body merry products are awesome!! A++</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found over the years that no face cream products do the miracles they claim to do, even the overpriced products. Hey, Jennifer Garner is naturally beautiful, crankcase oil would look good on her face. This product contains ingredients that are natural and reportably helpful for wrinkles and aging skin. That said, I seem to notice some stiffening of my facial skin and smoothing of wrinkles if I continuously use it. If I stop during a camping trip or art show, the effect reverses. So, if you buy some, use it every morning and night or under makeup. I do wish there was sunscreen in it. That is the only reason for the four star rating. I also like the 3.4 ounce size &#x3D; a great value. Try it. Now for something to reduce my sagging, puffy eyelids. Since this writing I found this seller also sells this and I am trying it.</li>
    <li> This is also an awesome retinol cream. I do not use it every day, but it seems to help with my red cheeks. It does not take much of the product to work well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the price and the results!!  I mix with some George&#x27;s Aloe gel and it really helps make the skin look younger!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER</li>
    <li> I highly recommend. I notice a difference after just a few uses. It seems to soften the skin and at my age I have only 1 wrinkle (knock on wood) and I noticed significant reduction.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer!  I use it morning and night as a last step after washing, toning, after this firming lotion [[ASIN:B00JT6036C Face &amp; Neck Firming Cream - Lotion Tightens Loose and Sagging Skin - Smooths Wrinkles and Fine Lines - 2 Oz.]]  and this eye serum [[ASIN:B00JR7VNVM Best Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Sagging Skin, Wrinkles and Crow&#x27;s Feet &amp;#x2605; By KESHIMA &amp;#x2605; Anti-Aging Eye Gel With Skin Brightening Elements &amp;#x2605; Potent Ingredients Include Complex Peptides, Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Aloe and Green Tea &amp;#x2605; Oil Free, Non Comedogenic, Safe For All Skin Types &amp;#x2605; 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back!]]&lt;br /&gt;This cream is thick and I always apply it last, but it soaks in fast so I never have a greasy face during the day or get greasy pillowcases at night. Just be patient and give it 5-10 minutes to absorb..it will. I have a normal skin type.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly an amazing product especially in combo with the other products. I am skeptical, so I took some harsh closeups of myself on the first day before using this routine. It was difficult to look at my droopy eyes, hollow cheeks and the beginnings of a sagging neck. I always felt &amp;#34;I didn&#x27;t have THESE issues.&amp;#34; I diligently stuck to the routine. For a retinol product, I had no problem with any irritation and I am a fair skinned red-head and I spend a lot of time outdoors. After one month the neck cream was almost gone so I took new pics not really expecting a change...was I wrong! The slight sagging of my neck was all but gone, the droopiness of my eyes had tightened and puffed up and using this cream all over as a finish had plumped up the hollows under my cheek bones and smoothed the slight wrinkles on my forehead. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! I had enough confidence in the changes that I was brave enough to share my before pics with my daughter.  She was just as shocked.&lt;br /&gt;I have already reordered all three of these products..why change something that works?  I am 48 years old but can easily pass for 10 years younger, especially now.?  I am 48 years old but can easily pass for 10 years younger, especially now.</li>
    <li> I use this along with the serum and my face is soft and glowing ( my smile wrinkles are pretty too)  :)</li>
    <li> I started using Body Merry surge moisturizer and have been seeing fine lines disappear and my skin appears healthier.I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Too early to notice the difference. Will use it some more. Website notes to use it 6 to 8 weeks before noticing change.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! My skin is beautiful!! I have been using it for weeks now in place of my old moisturizer and my skin looks brighter and younger than before! I also used to suffer from dry, flaky skin around my cheek area and this moisturizer has helped to rid me of that problem! I am so happy I was given the opportunity to try this product free of charge and will definitely be buying in the future!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this retinol moisturizer. After a month of use I definitely see a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m mid 40&#x27;s with pretty normal skin. If I get a blemish I usually end up with a dark spot that takes forever to go away. Using this product has diminished this and improved my skin tone overall.</li>
    <li> I am really liking this product. Had it for a few weeks and I use it daily on my face and neck. I can really see a difference - less wrinkles on my neck and face.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this moisturizer. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and will continue to do so. The customer service is awesome!  That&#x27;s a big plus.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  I was looking at a picture that was taken of me the other day and I saw me about 10-20 years ago.  I noticed that my skin looks younger  and I have a glow.  I&#x27;ve been using the face, neck and eiye cream for about 5 months and I am very impressed with the results.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have really oily skin, so I&#x27;m wary of moisturizers in general. It&#x27;s a really good thing that my physician friend warned me that my acne would get worse before it would get better with this. For the first week or so, it did seem to make me break out more, but after that it calmed down and I can tell a difference in the fine lines under my eyes and overall my skin is moisturized, but not too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got my second product, it worked even better since my skin was used to it!</li>
    <li> I really like this cream! I can notice a difference, at first it made me a little dry/peely but that went away quickly after I adjusted to it. Gives me a nice glow.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a month, and I can def feel the differences.</li>
    <li> I noticed difference in crows feet and minor wrinkles within a few weeks. But I also noticed little bumps breaking out all over my forehead and cheeks.  Once I stopped using the cream the breakouts went away :( sadly my skin is sensitive to the retinol . I began using it on my neck and deco lage with minor breakout. Wish I weren&#x27;t so sensitive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything, leave my skin a little oily and help nothing.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this product. Her facial area is smoother and better complexion since using this cream. Thank You</li>
    <li> I like this product because it is pretty versatile. I had no problem applying this product in the morning and then applying make up over the top. It is absorbed quickly into my skin so I can even wear it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions do say only to use at night if you have sensitive skin. I have a sensitivity to some products but not with this product. It is gentle enough for me to wear anytime. I love that it is not heavily scented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include retinol, aloe, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E. These are some amazing ingredients that offer various benefits such as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammatory properties, anti-aging, and even provides minimal UV protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Body Merry products, these are chemical, paraben, sulphate, phthalate and cruelty free. And Body Merry products are backed by a 90 Day 100% Satisfaction Guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I like it! Well, I like moisturizers for my face and neck but I don&#x27;t like all moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Body Merry 2.5% Professional Grade Retinol Moisturizer is very nice. It feels good on my skin. It looks good on my skin. It absorbs well. My skin looks very nice the next morning after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry has come through with another good product. I can confidently endorse this Retinol Moisturizer. Now some folks have a little problem with retinol products and have to use care that it doesn&#x27;t dry their skin out too much. Personally, I have not found this product to be drying to my skin at all. It simply works nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary product to facilitate this review. Opinions expressed are solely my own. I was not compensated for this review.</li>
    <li> The dispenser is really nice.  Much better than a squeeze tube.  It&#x27;s effectiveness will not be known for quite a while though.</li>
    <li> The perks of using Body Merry’s Moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains safe natural and organic ingredients&lt;br /&gt;It contains maximum strength retinol at 2.5%&lt;br /&gt;It contains powerful anti-aging ingredients&lt;br /&gt;It is made in the USA at FDA approved labs&lt;br /&gt;It is made at BMP compliant facilities&lt;br /&gt;It contains no harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;It is not tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry provides a 90 day 100% money back guarantee, if you don’t like it just contact them for your refund!&lt;br /&gt;I cant use too many things without my skin breaking out, but Body Merry and Adovia are two of those lines! You can check out other reviews of these lines by visiting my blog at complete-bliss.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer comes in a plastic container, so no need to worry about a toddler breaking your expensive glass container. It is very lightly scented, which is nice! Nobody likes strong smelling products. It also has a pump, which I found a full pump provides MORE than enough for my face. I have a little left over so always have to apply it my neck as well. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly for being more of a creamy texture than a lotion texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every few days at night after a shower, because lets face it, as a mother and caretaker to Alzheimers woman, I don’t have much time for myself. Let alone a whole beauty routine. Even using it every few days, it keeps my skin moisturized throughout those few days. Since it has been in the 20’s-30’s and snowing for the past few weeks, the weather has begun effecting everyones skin here in Michigan. But not me! I usually get dry patches on my forehead and nose the most, but since I began using the moisturizer, I have hardly noticed those dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the fact that I am not even 30 have crow’s feet… well it has helped to reduce those little lines of aging and make me feel not as old (now if someone could just tell my body to stop creaking I would be all set!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a new night cream to use, using Body Merry will get you the results you are looking for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

    <li> This product does a wonderful job moisturizing the dry winter patches on my face.  I love the pump dispenser as it makes it spill proof.  This has a slight pleasant smell, but does not linger.  Since receiving this product for review, I use it morning and evening on my face and neck.  Use this product after cleansing and toning.  As with all Body Merry products, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It seems to be a great moisturizer. Too soon to determine is the wrinkles are going to disappear, but I am hopeful!</li>
    <li> So far so good! It does leave my face very soft! You only need a liitle of this cream and so the bottle lasts a long time! Definitely will order from body merry again!</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of this product on my skin. It is not greasy, and sinks in quickly. I have only been using it for a short time and my skin feels softer. I hope to see my fine lines reduce with further use.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I do notice a big difference in fine lines and wrinkles.  Will definitely keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> The texture is smooth and creamy, it is virtually odorless, it absorbs nicely, and it is affordable...plus, amazing customer service (Khushboo is wonderful!!).  If it continues to improve the texture of my skin even through hormonal changes and breakouts, I will be getting a new bottle when I run out :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this retinol moisturizer for about two weeks.  While I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s been long enough to make a difference on my crows feet and smile lines (I&#x27;m 46) my skin is definitely clear and glowing.  Even my friends have noticed and asked what I&#x27;ve been using.  I&#x27;m happy to recommend this. It feels nice,  and isn&#x27;t too drying for my skin.  I am looking forward to trying for of Body Merry products. ,</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  My face already feels and looks better.  I bought this product along with the Body Merry eye cream and the retinol serum. The eye cream has helped with my wrinkles, dark circles and puffiness. And this moisturizing cream leaves my face feeling like a pre-makeup primer - velvety smooth and softer looking. I&#x27;ll give an update in a few weeks and let you know if I&#x27;m still happy.</li>
    <li> Runs out very fast, too expensive.</li>
    <li> I had a difficult time reviewing this item because although it does what it claims to do, I believe it&#x27;s a little too strong for my skin, and I now have red marks on my face where the skin turned raw. I understand this is a problem for some people with sensitive skin, and once my skin returns to normal, I will use the product every other day, not every day.</li>
    <li> We received this product for free, the opinion is my own.  This is nothing harsh in this product to hurt your face. My wife is 47 and she wanted a product that improved the skin of her face. She tried this product and she loves how it moisturizes her face.  She also loves that this product is easy to use and it adds vitamins and retinol to her skin. The product comes in a can, that makes it easy to bring on a trip with you. My wife appreciates how it is improving her skin and making her face look younger, while feeling softer.</li>
    <li> Body Merry&#x27;s products are always fantastic, what can I say? This moisturizer has definitely helped with the clearing of my older acne scars. They already look about 15% lighter. It isn&#x27;t a significant change, but for only using the product for 2 weeks, I&#x27;m quite impressed. Plus, I don&#x27;t expect much out of a moisturizer except for moisturized skin, so the added benefit of the retinol is great. I can&#x27;t say what it does for wrinkles or fine lines because I&#x27;m still quite young, but with the high percentage of retinol in this moisturizer, I bet it would definitely help with those issues over time. Now for the actual moisturizer itself, it is a pretty heavy moisturizer. When I put it on I do have to dab it off some because if I don&#x27;t, I find it leaves me looking a bit greasy. This is probably because of the fact that I have oily skin, though. If you have dry skin this benefit you more than it did me. I do however have acne prone skin, and although it is a bit heavy, this has never broken me out. The smell of this product also caught me off guard as it smells like a mixture of plastic and sunscreen, which I can definitely deal with given my positive results. It does do its job at moisturizing though as my skin never feels dry throughout the rest of the day, as I put this on in the morning. All in all, this is a great moisturizer if you&#x27;re looking for something to correct those pesky skin issues and deeply moisturize your skin at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product free of charge for testing purposes, but this does not change how I feel about the product. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> The product is great! Very lightweight, I wear it every day under my makeup. It dries pretty matte, not greasy or shiny at all. I have only been using it a few weeks, but I can already see a difference in my fine lines. It only takes one pump to thoroughly moisturizer your face, so it is a good deal for the price. When this one runs out, I will definitely be buying again!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!! My skin feels wonderfully moisturized without any flaking that some retinols can give.  I&#x27;m almost 50 and most people swear I&#x27;m only 40, so yes this works!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer without parabens. This is an excellent choice. Not greasy and you see subtle results in 1 month.</li>
    <li> Love this product this is second purchase, Iam 68 and no one knows it. I see a difference by using this product</li>
    <li> I find this ok. I&#x27;m a serious person when it comes down to what I put on my skin. I really think this is a good product but it ALL depends on where you live. I didn&#x27;t find this product gave me much moisture for my face. I live in a very cold state and the climate is very cold. This moisturizer did nothing. My face was still dry. Again, it may work for you depending on your climate and place you reside.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, I am a male and I just gave this product a try after finding it one of the the top sellers on Amazon. I could not be more happier with the product. Also the people behind the product are very nice and prompt to answer your questions. Would definitely buy again.. :)</li>
    <li> Recieved very quicj. And love this moisturizer</li>
    <li> This Retinol Surge Moisturizer has really done wonders for my skin. It looks and feels smoother, brighter and more youthful. My skin feels firmer and my fine lines are gone. This moisturizer is creamy and luxurious but not greasy. Glides on the skin easily and absorbs quickly. It is virtually odorless which is nice, I dislike over powering scents especially for face creams. After just one application you will notice that your skin is smoother and so much softer. The product comes in a bottle with built in pump. All you need is one pump to moisturize your entire face + neck. I haven&#x27;t had any irritations, which are usually common being that I have sensitive skin, but not in this case for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really appreciate the fact that Body Merry uses natural and organic ingredients and that their products are not tested on animals. This is a big, big plus for me. Customer Service is great, I own other products from this line and have been very happy with them. They all compliment each other very well. You will not be disappointed and hey, if you are, they have a 90-day Money back guarantee. Don&#x27;t take my word for it try it for yourself.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the product!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin and worried about possible reaction.  No issues at all!  Use the moisturizer each morning and night ... only a little dab needed.  My skin looks markedly better.  After 6 weeks or so I finally realized the formerly noticeable horizontal little line across my forehead was barely noticeable.  Same for the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still new at this being in my 30&#x27;s thing, but I started reading up on how my skin care regimen needed an upgrade from my teens and 20&#x27;s. Everything I read said add retinol to your regimen. I did some research before settling upon this product. While I wasn&#x27;t expecting results so quickly, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by the difference in my skin. My tone and my pores look fantastic. My skin absorbed it quickly and I&#x27;ve had ZERO breakouts from it. I did notice it doesn&#x27;t do away with the dry patches on my face though, so I still use my old moisturizer in the mornings, and use this stuff at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week on this I went ahead and ordered the Hyaluronic Dew Serum and WOW. I&#x27;m also doing bentonite masks twice a week, but otherwise I just cleanse and moisturize. My skin has never looked this good...EVER. I know a lot of people got these products for free, but I bought mine and still love them.</li>
    <li> This was the very first time I&#x27;ve tried a retinol moisturizer because I&#x27;ve heard so many bad reviews about how other brands dry out your face and skin. I have normal skin which can sometimes dry out in the winter so, I was concerned about how it work. I must say, Body Merry products are the absolute best!!! My skin is clearly moisturized and when its applied, my skin feels tight and fresh. This is definitely a great, trustworthy product to use if your past anti-aging products have failed.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! I recommend totally this product!  I have seen amazing results after only three weeks of use. I also have the eye cream and serum and really like them too! I have sensitive skin and have not been able to use many other products but saw the great reviews on this product so I thought I would give it a try. I am so thankful I did! I have two babies so sleep is a rare thing right now but this has really helped with keeping my skin looking great. TRY IT,  you will certainly be glad you did! A+ Mom approved for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Just ordered again.  It seems as though this mosturizer is the only one that has worked for me, maybe because I use the vitamin c serum which dries me out.  Will order again and again, its a keeper!</li>
    <li> I am loving this..I&#x27;ve only been using it for only 3 days and my skin is already looking smoother and brighter ^_^..plus I had some pimples on my left cheeks and that area has almost completely smoothed out..WONDERFUL :D..I&#x27;m only 26 and have no wrinkles yet, but it&#x27;s never too early to start preventing those wrinkles..I can already tell this moisturizer is very POWERFULL..I LOVE IT - I clearly see it improving my skin by the days- I highly recommend it ;) - I see myself using it for years on end and looking mega young into my late 30s- 40s and beyond !</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer and I have not had any problems using it twice a day.  My only concern is that I need a moisturizer with sunscreen.  I still ordered another bottle and after communicating with the company I am hopeful that they will make this product with a sunscreen.  Great company to deal with which is appreciated.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing moisturizer. I have mixed skin but it seems to be getting dryer, and none of the fancy moisturizers I tried helped. I started slowly and built up to daily use, and my skin was softer and more moist from the start. After a month it is supple and smooth- not to say it removes wrinkles,  but it certainly makes them less prominent because my skin is so supple now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company emailed me to ask how it was working for me, and once I replied with questions they replied right away. I wanted to know if it should go on before or after sunscreen (before) and if it was ok to use under my eyes. Their reply was that I should be careful as the skin there is delicate, but it might be ok.  I have been using it there as well, but less often.  So far a great product from a responsive company.  I will update when I need to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smoothly and absorbs pretty quickly.  It does not leave my skin feeling coated or greasy, just soft and supple.</li>
    <li> Very good moisturizer I have used so far! Will re order.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for a few weeks now, and believe I am starting to see some difference.  My skin is in a state of flux because of changes to my HRT.  It gave me acne that I didn&#x27;t have as a teen.  I believe that using this cream over time, my skin will return to its original state and maybe even better than before.  I plan to order the eye cream next.</li>
    <li> I am a huge Body Merry fan, and I love this moisturizer. There is no harsh fragrances, it makes my skin soft and smooth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product and it is truly amazing. After trying many Retinol products it&#x27;s nice to find one that works!  I&#x27;d highly recommend it to all. My pump broke on the first bottle and it was promptly replaced and I got to keep the other bottle. This is a commonly that puts the customer first and you don&#x27;t find that often anymore. Can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!!  Love the smell and texture. Will purchase again for sure!</li>
    <li> A good creamy alternative to the Pro-A serum. Great value for $$ and the customer service is superb!</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer - gentle but effective</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one yet but if it works as well as the other retinal 2.5 it will be a wonderful buy.it&#x27;s the best price I have seen so far for a product like this.Update- I have used it now for three months And I am totally sold on it,try it and you will love it.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. Use it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Started using this product upon receipt.  I have now been using this product for over a year and  alread I am seeing noticeable changes in the wrinkle lines.  Good product, I like it.  In  I like the manner in which my face is nearly wrinkly free and my skin glows.  Great Product.</li>
    <li> I love this Retinol moisturizer, absolutely love it!  My skin tone has evened out. I will be continuing to use this.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. Gentle on my skin and soaks right in. The company sent instructions before I received which was impressive and shows they are. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this product worked as it stated so I purchased the serum (by Body Merry) and now I love them both!  I wish there could be an all in one but for now, this and the serum work great together!</li>
    <li> Great products and great seller...  Love them both...  100% recommended..</li>
    <li> Does what it says. Skin is tight and glowing, absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I really like this night-time moisturizer. I use it over the retinol serum. What I like about this moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Moisturizes well, immediately plumps the skin and lessens wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;2. My skin looks better in the morning than when I went to bed. This is pretty amazing considering my skin usually looks worse! (Yes I said the same thing about the retinol serum, however I&#x27;ve used the serum with and without this moisturizer, and this moisturizer makes the skin look even better.)&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or burn my skin, no redness.&lt;br /&gt;4. My skin is soft in the morning, not dry like some other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say what the long-term effects will be. I&#x27;ve been using it for a shorter period than the serum because I purchased it after the serum. I wanted to try another product from this company because I was so impressed by the serum. I think this moisturizer may be a great option for people who may be sensitive to retinol because it&#x27;s so moisturizing. But I&#x27;m not a skincare expert so that&#x27;s just my opinion. This is definitely worth trying.</li>
    <li> I am thoroughly pleased with the retinol surge moisturizer. I love that it is in a pump bottle to help me regulate the amount that I want. I chose this moisturizer because I thought I should start taking care of my skin. I avoided moisturizing my skin up until now because most moisturizers gave my skin a very greasy feeling, which I abhor, and I noticed that I would break out when this happened. I discovered that moisturizing my skin is actually very important in making one look young and healthy but I hated having to choose between having dry skin, that would lead to wrinkles, and breaking out. After seeing a myriad of positive reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try. I loved it. I love that it does not make my skin feel greasy. It makes my skin feel smoote and soft all the while moisturizing my skin. I have had no breakouts caused by this product and I am very pleased. I will definitely continue to purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I received this product in January.  I was using Tretinoin Cream .05% for the last 4 years.  I struggled with the dry cakey skin it left me with everyday.  I tried many different heavy moisturizers but the dry cracked skin still came through.  I was about to give up.  Well, for a week I did.  My skin didn&#x27;t heal.  I thought about the strength of the cream, and that it may be too strong.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this cream, and can now say that my skin is soft and smooth and love this product!  I am finally happy with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Body Merry would make a daily moisturizer for under makeup, and even better would be to add clear zinc oxide to it for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will be happy to buy that!!&lt;br /&gt;This  is a great product for beautiful skin</li>
    <li> I sooooooo love this product. I live in NY. We all know how brutal the weather has been here in the north. I am not a big fan of the cold because my skin looks 10 years older than I am in the winter. So, winter is not my favorite season. I always have used a good Vitamin C facial product and added this Retinol moisturizer to my facial routine. I love that its not greasy and applies so well on the face...no pulling ladies. This product has made my makeup go on so easy...my skin has absolutely changed. It glows, better texture, smooth....and the biggest compliment I&#x27;ve received the other day from my son&#x27;s soccer team mom&#x27;s....thinking I got a little nip and tuck over these winter months. So Body Merry keep making this product. A fan in NY.</li>
    <li> I put this on all over my face at night after cleansing and in the morning before I put my makeup on. I have extremely dry skin so this has definitely helped with my skin flaking. Very moisturizing and it hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all. I notice I have less redness (like around the nose area). I&#x27;m only 20 years old so I can&#x27;t say for sure that this helps tighten skin and smooth out wrinkles, I&#x27;m using it as a preventative for wrinkles. I use it every morning and every night and it seems to last me about 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve struggled with oily skin and acne. Because of the acne I had ice pick size scars. I&#x27;ve tried everything including home remedies to atleast minimize them! Until now! I recently purchased this off of Amazon a month ago and I LOVE IT!! It has helped clear my acne AND scars! I&#x27;ve also noticed my fine lines have diminished as well! My skin feels smooth and looks better than it ever has in years! I give this product 5 stars! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This cream is great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used up half a bottle so far and i&#x27;m really impressed with the results. I mainly got it to treat uneven skin tone and sun burn spots on my face from being in the sun and getting heat rash on my face. I noticed my skin tone and the over all look on my skin is way way better now.&lt;br /&gt;I also had this one deep frown line on my forehead. The cream really did make my frown line fade. I didnt care much about the frown line though so i didnt always rub the cream on but still, the frown line definitely faded.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing i like about the cream is that  the immediately result of using it is it leaves a nice glow on my face in the morning. It doesnt make your face oily or shinning but leave a nice glow.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using this Retinol cream from body merry, I&#x27;ve tried other name brand creams and bio-oil i brought from drug stores and by far body merry cream is definitely better than the other name brand cream and oil.</li>
    <li> I am using this product each night and am pleased with how my complexion seems clearer and the dark spots on my face appear to be lighter.  I will continue to use nightly and plan to order a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Tips for getting the most out of this moisturizer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Test on a small area of your skin first to check for any allergies.&lt;br /&gt;-If you have sensitive skin or if you are using Retinol for the first time, start with using the moisturizer just twice or thrice a week (at night) to begin with, and then gradually increase to daily use.&lt;br /&gt;-For best results, use it with your regular toner and serum. You can use a hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin c serum or even a retinol serum (if you are a seasoned retinol user).&lt;br /&gt;-If you are in a colder region and your skin starts to dry, you can alternate with a more moisturizing cream.&lt;br /&gt;-Wear sunscreen during the day.&lt;br /&gt;-Regular long term use is the key to seeing great results. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because common results are noticeable around 6-8 weeks of daily use and I have just received this product I will update my review with my progress but I wanted to leave tips Body Merry provided to me of this Retinol Moisturizer Cream (that I requested to be provided for evaluation and review.)</li>
    <li> I bought this along with the retinol serum. With the 2 of these products I have seen such a change in my skin in a matter of a 2 week period I am AMAZED! I wrote a more detailed review under the retinol  serum, so I will say that using with this moisturizier has done the job of reducing my  wrinkles and giving me that confidence boost I was looking for being in my mid 20s. Goes on smoothly,  little to no smell at all. Has a cooling feeling on my skin after serum is applied, and my skin has not broken out once since using these products. Bye bye wrinkles! !!</li>
    <li> Body Merry was sweet enough to send me both their Retinol Surge Moisturizer and their Hyaluronic Dew Serum. Their service was extremely prompt and when communicating with the company they were quick to respond and very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I find these are not the products for me. They advertise that it contains a potent youth reviving ingredient. If that means it burns when you put it on, it must be working. Having said that, I do have sensitive skin, so it could just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither product has any fragrance that I could detect. So if you are sensitive to fragrances this might be a good choice for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products left my skin first feeling greasy and then feeling sticky when I tried to wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having tried other serums and moisturizers, I am afraid that I can not put this at the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in ordering this product you can do so here http://www.amazon.com/retinol-moisturizer-professional-moisturizer-satisfaction/dp/b00oqqlng4/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;utf8&amp;qid&#x3D;1424700836&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;best+anti+aging+retinol+moisturizer+for+wrinkles+and+neck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided at no cost for an honest product review.&lt;br /&gt;2cents@40 does not get monetary compensation to review all products.

    <li> This stuff works so well! My skin is clearing up.</li>
    <li> Ingredients: Organic Aloe, Organic Sunflower Oil, Palm Oil, Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Vitamin E, Plant Derived Hyaluronic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Organic Jojoba Oil, Wildcrafted Green Tea, Wildcrafted Propolis, Shea Butter, Vitamin B5, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid. It comes in a plastic pump bottle with an added plug to more fully seal it. This protects the contents from environmental contamination and oxidation. The product is made in the USA. It is not tested on animals. The product remains fresh for 12 months after opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Product: This lightweight, creamy lotion spreads easily and absorbs well. Immediately, I could feel a cooling sensation and it started softening my skin as soon as it was applied. It definitely minimized fine lines and wrinkles and appeared to brighten my skin. There was only a slight scent, but it would not interfere with other scents such as perfume. Continued use kept my skin soft and smooth. My skin appeared well hydrated and supple. Even after cleansing, my skin looked great, radiant and younger. The ingredients in this product work together to nourish and rehydrate skin and help the skin retain moisture. It can easily be worn under makeup. There is a suggestion that for persons who have never used a retinol formula before, they should start off with using it every other day. I have used retinol creams before and I know how well they work. I have also used other products from Body Merry and they are always high quality and do what they say. While your results may not be identical to mine, I do recommend this retinol formula to improve the texture and appearance of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product mentioned above for free to test and review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> I am loving this Retinol Moizturizer by  Body Merry. Retinol is actually an amazing product and does some pretty amazing things for your skin. It actually helps reduce the looks of fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots, scares and scares from acne. Overall it just improves the appearance of your skin. The product also has other amazing ingredients such as well such as Aloe, Hyaluronic Acid, and Vitamin E. All which help with either hydration, moisturizing and wrinkles as well. Also Body Merry product are Organic so there are no harsh chemicals and they are cruelty free!!!! That is another huge plus for me. With any beauty product I test on my arm first to make sure there was no skin reaction. And there wasn&#x27;t any at all. I then started using it on my face and within the first week I seen a huge difference in my skin texture. Also my skin was so moisturized it help reduce the appearance of any fine lines I have and wrinkles. I was super excited about that. I am in love with this product for sure. And I am very happy with it. I did receive this product complementary for inspection and my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I received this within a few days after ordering. Very fast service!  The product seems very nice, and I like the consistency, feels nice on my face and neck.</li>
    <li> It is truly a lovely lotion. I was pretty skeptical when I first bought it, and even when I received it (the packaging is not what you would expect from a really nice lotion). But, I was shocked when I was about 4 days in on how much smoother my skin felt and looked. After about a week, I set down my foundation and haven&#x27;t picked it back up since. My fiance even mentioned after I had used it for a while how much better my skin was looking. Keep in mind that I don&#x27;t have bad skin problems, only some issues with tone and wrinkles, but this stuff made my skin feel and look awesome! I don&#x27;t think it is any kind of &#x27;miracle anti aging&#x27; lotion (is there really one?), but it is pretty great. I have only been using it a couple of weeks (maybe 3) 1-2x per day, and have great results so far!</li>
    <li> I dont&#x27; think this was actually helping my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. Does a decent job with skin repair however the effects take consistent use to see. It isn&#x27;t a miracle and if you only use it a for a few days you may not notice results.</li>
    <li> Nice as a moisturizer. Did not notice a difference in my dark spots from acne. Heavy enough moisturizer to help with lines around eyes though. I add a few drops of argan oil with this for a boost when it&#x27;s dry out and at night for an added bonus.</li>
    <li> We received this product about a week ago free of charge to leave an honest review and tell everybody what we think. As many of you know I love Body merry products they have quickly become one of my favorite brands that I trust. When Body Merry tells you a product will do something, you can definitely trust that it will. The same with their Retinol Surge Moisturizer, it contains 2.5% retinol, Hyaluronic acid, vitamins e + b5, and green tea as active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love this formula! You can buy any retinol that you want, but they all will not be the same. Something about Body Merry&#x27;s retinol is different! And in a good way! It contains Hyaluronic acid as well so it is definitely a moisturizer. It leaves your skin feeling toner, softer and plumper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was again one of those products I tested on my husband Joe because he is 13 years older than me and I like to see drastic results. He used this Moisturizer with Body Merry&#x27;s Pro A serum and together they work wonderfully. Alone this Retinol surge moisturizer works great also, it leaves your face so smooth and soft. You also feel the toning and tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has drastically softened Joes smile lines and is starting to help soften the appearance of his overall skin texture. This stuff really works you just have to keep it up and keep it as part of your routine. It will start to begin to repair your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to all looking to add a retinol moisturizer to their skin routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you found this review to be helpful.</li>
    <li> What an amazing product! It makes my skin look so fresh and young. I became a big fan of Body Merry&#x27;s after having ordered their Age Defense eye cream.. This product works miracle on my skin. I have fine lines around my eyes, so after applying the cream the lines magically go away, wow I&#x27;ve tried lots of facial creams and serums but this one is my favourite so far..I will definitely order from this company again :-)</li>
    <li> This is the MOST amazing face cream I have ever used!  I have had amazing results with it and the value (what you pay and how much of the product you get) is unbeatable! I have used different face creams in the past and nothing has diminished my wrinkles and hydrated my skin like this. I highly recommend this product.  The seller even followed up with me to see how I liked the produce and asked if they could assist me with anything! Great product, Great company, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> I have received this product to test and it has got to be the best moisturizer, I have tried so far and I have tried several. I like that this natural  made  it is organic, the cream  has Hyaluronic acid, that is plant  based also it has green tea, organic Jojoba Oil, Vitamin E, Vitamin B5 and also Shea Butter it has made my  skin so smooth and silky like butter. I don&#x27;t even use it every day , have been using it every other day and my skin has been  smooth with a glow to it. You only have to use a little bit and it moistens your skin there is a slight oily feel until it drys but after it drys the oily feeling isn&#x27;t there anymore, so don&#x27;t let that bother you. The results I have gotten go beyond what I would have thought, I would have gotten with a moisturizer because this has 2.5% Retinol which helps aid in improving skin texture, wrinkles and helps with brown spots and helps give you a healthy glow. But I do love this Body Merry Moisturizer will definitely be  ordering another bottle when I run out of this for sure..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free copy of product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
    <li> Good product; works well!</li>
    <li> I recently tried this for a review. It has helped to even out my skin tone a lot. I have only been using it a week and was impressed. I can&#x27;t wait to see if it gets rid of those fine lines I have.</li>
    <li> I have used other Retinol creams, but was only able to find 2% without a prescription.  This one is 2.5% and a really great value.  I use it at night, after applying a Vitamin C serum (20%) and letting it dry for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> I love it! My skin is soft and smooth. I&#x27;m going to try the eye cream next.</li>
    <li> The wrinkles on the sides of my eyes have definitely been reduced.</li>
    <li> I like this very much. There is no perfumey smell and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy. I will purchase again and recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I started using the Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer for a month since the middle of November to be exact. I think that this is one of the best anti-aging moisturizers I’ve tried in a long time. The reason I say this is because I really like that the Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer doesn’t make my face look or feel oily. I really like that there is no fragrance, and the fact that it provides natural ingredients especially vegan Hyaluronic Acid is a plus. My skin feels moisturized for hours plus looks radiant. I love this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: The Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer was sent to me for review purposes. However the opinions expressed are 100% my own based on my experience with the product.</li>
    <li> If you want a serious cream that does wonders for your skin, then look no further than this 2.5 Retinol Cream! Retinol is actually an amazing ingredient that is commonly known as the Youth reviving skin care treatment. This has done wonders for my crows feet and fine lines that WERE all over my face! Not anymore! I was sent this Retinol Moisturizing cream from Body merry for testing purposes and for a review on my blog and I must say this is amazing! I am still using this 2 times a day and will be purchasing another bottle as mine is halfway gone because my hubby started using it too! Lol He SAW the difference! You can too, just purchase a bottle right now! I highly recommend this product and everybody needs to worry about aging and your skin, since every odd is aging and your skin looses elasticity as you age, but this will help put the elasticity back into your skin! Merry Christmas Everybody, and go order a bottle today!</li>
    <li> Works great and already showing significant signs of reduced age lines after only 8 days of use and it DOES NOT irritate skin at all :)</li>
    <li> I was recently contacted by Body Merry to try out and review their Retinol Surge Moisturizer.  This facial cream contains 2.5% retinol, hyaluronic acid, Vitamin E + B5, green tea; plus other great ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a straight up beauty junkie and have tons of makeup and face creams lying around my bathroom counter.  However I get bored quickly.  While I understand that it takes time to see results, but I also can tell when something is not working or will cause issues to my sensitive skin.  The fact that this contains 2.5 retinol concerned me.  However in the name of beauty we try it all!! This cream came in perfect timing since the winter weather season is upon us.  However depending where you live, depends on how bad this dreadful cold winter causes damage to your skin.  I have been using this moisturizer for about 2-3 weeks and I must say I have seen some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes in a plastic bottle with no see-through panel which is important.  Since retinol is Vitamin A in a less concentrated form (vs. retinoids), air and light cause it to break down.  Another plus point is that it comes in a pump form which is great to allow minimal air into the bottle and eliminates bacteria getting in from our hands.  I love anything pump form because I get the amount of product I need without the mess.  However what really sold me on this moisturizer (as if the other stuff I mentioned wasn&#x27;t as awesome) is that its thicker than your average moisturizers, especially for this time of the year when your skin needs all the reinforcement it can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cream I noticed that my face feels softer and didn&#x27;t feel dried out with this horrid winter weather!  My skin felt and looked more plumped out and very smooth.  I had no peeling or burning sensation that comes with using retinol.  It dried quickly so I was able to apply my makeup right after and it did not have a strong smell either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It also works well if you layer a serums on your face before using this to get that extra punch.  Vitamin C serums works great to give retinol an added punch.  However with all that being said, when using any sort of retinol products you MUST use a sunscreen.  Retinol just like Vitamin C makes your face more sensitive to the sun.  If you are using any of these products and not protecting your face with sunscreen, you 1. are causing greater damage to your face 2. will actually get a sunburn and 3. will make any skin issue you have worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots and so on are also causes by sun exposure and not just aging or acne.  If you don&#x27;t use a sunscreen that offers broadband protection (UVA and UVB) then don&#x27;t buy this or anything else as you are just wasting your money and constantly will be reversing the work that these products are meant to do on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I was happy with the product and would recommend it to my beauties.erums on your face before using this to get that extra punch.

    <li> I have sensitive skin so I used this product at nighttime. Pleased it did not have any adverse effects and so happy with the effects I have seen so far with using. My skin feels so smooth after applying and my few ance scars have faded dramatically. This moisturizer definitely Reversed my fear of retinol serums, as the previous brand I had used dried me up like the Sahara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free For my honest feedback. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer comes in a huge 3.4 fl oz/100 ml airless plastic container with a pump. Its rich yet light consistency spreads easily and absorbs quickly leaving my skin extra soft and moisturized without greasy residue. I love using this moisturizer every morning before applying my foundation. Body Merry Retinol Surge Moisturizer gives my skin healthy glow and keeps my face hydrated throughout the day. I really enjoy this moisturizer and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;__________________&lt;br /&gt;PR Sample. All opinions are my own and 100% honest.</li>
    <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of dry skin around my nose area, so I&#x27;ve been searching for a new moisturizer and was excited to receive this product to try and review.  The moisturizer comes in a pretty large-sized pump container.  I loved the pump and the ability to control exactly how much product I used, without worrying about bacteria unnecessarily getting back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer itself was non-greasy and absorbed into my skin within moments.  In the past, I&#x27;ve had to wait a few minutes after applying moisturizer before I could begin putting on my makeup, but not with this!  It absorbs into the skin almost instantly.  This product was amazing and cleared up my dry skin after just one use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the Retinol Surge Moisturizer with me to my parents house while visiting during Thanksgiving, and made my mom try it.  She also loved it - and I ended up telling her to keep it, and I would purchase my own!  This is definitely a product that I will keep in my daily routine.</li>
    <li> Excellent moisturizer! By far my favorite especially now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  Although I wish I had found it years ago. Goes on smoothly w/o greasy or oily feeling. Great for under makeup as well as prior to bed. Highly recommend. Going to have my husband begin using it too.</li>
    <li> I’ve been using the Retinal Surge Moisturizer for a month now. It’s a light weight cream and has no scent. I usually use it more at night to rejuvenate my skin more. According to the recommendations on the label, it states that one should moisturized after applying but I think it has enough moisturizer in it that I didn’t need to add more. I’m not sure if the instruction are intended for people that might have very dry skin. But in my case, there’s no need. My skin feels smooth and improved with just night applications. I was give this product for free and I’m providing my honest opinion in exchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This would be my third product by Body Merry and I like the fact that the products I’ve used have natural ingredients that are known for their great properties of nurturing and repairing the skin back to its natural health. I would recommend it to anyone that might be searching for a product that will revitalized their skin.&lt;br /&gt; Also remember that this product has a 90-day, 100% satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> So far, so good....I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month but I am starting to see some small changes so I recently ordered a second bottle so I can continue using it.  It has a little thicker consistency than the moisturizers that I normally use but I have already adjusted to that and don&#x27;t even think about it now!!  I&#x27;m hoping for more noticeable results in the next few weeks!!</li>
    <li> My skin positively glows and I love the way my skin feels when using the moisturizer - so firm and so soft. All the little wrinkles I had under my eyes and near my mouth are gone! I have been using Body Merry Pro-A Serum and they offered me the moisturizer to test &amp; see if I liked it on the condition I would leave feedback (negative or positive). Well, I&#x27;ve used it for awhile now and I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Retinol Moisturizer for about 10 days now and can definitely see a positive change. I&#x27;m a 35 year old black male who has battled acne scarring and hyperpigmentation throughout his life. I had hoped the moisturizer could alleviate some of those issues. I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. In 10 short days, the moisturizer has already made positive, visible changes to my skin tone and texture. I can&#x27;t wait to see where things stand after a month!</li>
    <li> This is the best facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have had years of skin problems, redness, Rosacea and larges clogged pores. I&#x27;ve used every product out there. This is the only product that has ever made a significant change in my skin. Even corrected lines/wrinkles as well as longstanding skin problems. I highly recommend this product. Seller even followed up with personal email with directions on how to use and contact with any questions.</li>
    <li> Nice quantity for the price. The product seems to be working. I have noticed an improvement in the wrinkles on my 59 year old face. It&#x27;s not a quick dramatic change but subtly over time.</li>
    <li> great product thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recently starting using this Body Merry Retinol Moisturizer so it hasn&#x27;t shown a big difference on my skin yet, but I do like that it&#x27;s non greasy and goes on smoothly.  I also like the pump design so you can easily pump right onto your finger tip(s) and not have to get any of the moisturizer stuck underneath your nail(s).</li>
    <li> Body Merry is my new indulgence. I have almost purchased every product in the line.</li>
    <li> Today I am sharing my thoughts on Body Merry’s 2.5% Retinol Moisturizer, which is said to be youth reviving with hyaluronic acid, vitamins E, and B5, as well as green tea. This moisturizer is to even skin tone, moisturize wrinkles, fine lines, acne, and dark spots while.reduce signs of aging. As well as leaving your skin radiant, plumper, soft, and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying a product with retinol, and it retinol itself is a ingredient I just recently discovered, so when I was offered the chance to try it out, I was more than excited. This ingredients also include shea butter, organic aloe vera, jojoba oil, and green tea, all of which have great benefits of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing as I was new to retinol, I followed the directions in the beginning and only used the moisturizer once every other day until my skin was ready for daily use. As stated, I applied on my face and neck after cleansing and toning. Now I would like to note that this product can be worn under make-up for those interested in that information. I only used this product once a night because of my sensitive, oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is unique with such wonderful added benefits, and within a few uses my skin felt hydrated again. The product is a thick cream that did leave a bit of an oily residue, however it absorbed really well into my skin, and applied easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the packaging as well. It’s is plastic, so no risk of breaking glass, and comes with an easy-to-use pump that doesn’t stick, and a few pumps will have enough product to apply to the skin. This product is originally listed for $70, but the price has been reduced by 57% on Amazon, so it is selling for $30. During the winter my skin, especially my face, will become dry very quickly, so I do look forward to using this sparingly throughout the colder months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

I appreciate the fact that this Moisturizer comes in a pump so I&#x27;m not contaminating everything by sticking my fingers into a jar. I suffer from extremely dry skin and I use this moisturizer twice a day, and I haven&#x27;t had my skin react at all and I find this is just enough moisture for me.

    <li> Being a natural fair skinned redhead, I am very careful, I use at night, sunscreen in daytime.</li>
    <li> I was able to review this for free.&lt;br /&gt;Pump style bottle very easy to control with a pretty maroon colored label. It has a medium thick white soothing creamy texture. It absorbs very quickly into the skin, not greasy. There is, no irritation or burning in case you were wondering due to the Retinol. The scent is mild and is quite hydrating. It make my skin feel nice and smooth after applying. So overall I would have to say I did like this and would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
    <li> I have tried the eye cream by Body Merry and I absolutely love it so when I was given the opportunity to test out the facial moisturizer, I did not hesitate.  This product is all natural and contains 2.5% retinol, hyaluronic acid, vitamins E and B5, and green tea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients are supposed to reduce signs of again, hydrate and nourishes skin making it feel and look smoother and plumper.  The formulation also does not contain any harsh chemicals such as parabens, sulphates and phthalates.  It is made in the USA and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer was not too thin or too thick which I like.  I tried smelling it and didn&#x27;t really detect any fragrance at all so it seems to be fragrance free.  It absorbs quite well without any sticky residue.  After about 15-20 minutes after application, I ran my hands over my face and it felt hydrated, supple and quite smooth.  The moisturizer also comes in a pump bottle versus a jar which makes this a great product for travel as you don&#x27;t have to worry about spilling or product sticking to the lid of the jar.  I actually prefer to have hyaluronic acid in my beauty care routine as I find that it does help to smooth out my skin and make it feel softer.</li>
    <li> I bought this moisturizer and their eye cream.  Both have a very nice feel to them and the ingredients sound incredible, but neither one did anything for me.  It is disappointing to spend the money without seeing any results.</li>
    <li> I love the Body Merry line and I am an aficionado of anti aging products. This Retinol Moisturizer is one of my favorite products, as it is a great anti aging cream that does not dry out my face. I have tried Retinol based products in the past that have burned my skin and left it looking very dry and feeling irritated. Body Merry’s Retinol Moisturizer has changed how I viewed retinol based products, as it is very gentle on my sensitive skin and it delivers what it promises it’s supposed to do. It truly is worth buying and trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> So far I like this moisturizer. I feel like the Retinol Moisturizer by Body Merry helps keep my skin looking youthful. I recieved this product complimentary from Tomoson for testing/review purposes but I only recommend products I would use personally and believe will be good products.</li>
    <li> I am only giving it 3 stars because I think I need more time to evaluate the product.  So far I do like it and I haven&#x27; t had any adverse reactions to the product.  If it is really a professional grade retinol I will be able to tell within a few months.  I would give it a try. I ordered this when I ordered my Derma Roller. I use it after I use the roller and also every morning.  Great Customer Service.  I would order from this company again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Body Merry Serum for a few months now and decided to get the moisturizer too in order to enhance the progress of my skin. I have only used this product for two days now, morning and night. I tend to have oily skin in and the moisturizer has not increased the oil at all, which is a huge plus for me! It does not leave a greasy finish after application either. When I wake up in the morning my skin has felt smooth and refreshed, and I have felt like i have not needed to wash my face as soon as I wake up. It is fine wear under your makeup as well :)</li>
    <li> Turning 30 in August and decided to start with anti-aging skin care regimen.  This lotion has a nice consistency that absorbs quickly and doesnt leave a greasy feel. A full pump is waaay too much for face AND neck... i would say half a pump to 3/4 pump would do well to cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale, sensitive, acne prone skin so im very very picky about the products that i use.  Ive been using this for almost a month at night and i like it.  This does not make me break out, which alone is amazing, but it has also helped to clear up my skin!  Very little drying because of the retinol and doesnt sting when i use it.  i put this on after witch hazel toner and the hyaluronic serum from Body Merry.  The little wrinkles that i do have - some under my eyes from when i smile (i have chipmunk cheeks what can i say) and laugh lines around my mouth, seem to have lightened a bit - cant tell for sure yet and i will update after another month of use.&lt;br /&gt;Would love to be able to see how much is left in the bottle - the current design leaves no way to tell how much is left and leaves you guessing - thats my ONLY complaint with this product.  Ive been using about a month and im not sure how much is left - maybe another 2wks?  Absolutely no way of telling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited about a month to post this review, so i could leave some input as to the quality and use of this product.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that this is the first moisturizer I have used with Retinol in it.  This particular moisturizer doesn&#x27;t have a detectable scent to me and it is a thick formula.  I typically reach for it at night because it takes a long time to absorb into my skin.  I have been using this moisturizer for nearly a month now and I can&#x27;t see much of a difference when it comes to any acne spots or even with lines and wrinkles.  To be completely honest I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles yet, but I do have a few around my eyes.  I do feel like this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling hydrated in the morning and not overly greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I usually have very sensitive skin but even when using this morning and night I didn&#x27;t have any issues.  In just a couple of weeks my skin is nice and soft, and all of my dark spots have almost disappeared.  Will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s part of my daily routine. Along with the serums and eye cream. You will notice a difference in your skin with continued use. Its brighter, smoother, dark spots are less visible, as well as fine lines. I&#x27;m very impressed. And its very light, which I love. No greasy feeling or shine. All the Body Merry products are lovely and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I am a product junkie and have tried so many retinols and moisturizers.  This is the VERY FIRST product that moisturizes my skin without making it break out.  This product has a perfect balance for my skin to moisturize and not get too dry with Retinol.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in fine lines, but I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  My complexion is so much better balanced and my skin looks brighter and healthier.  A very little amount of product goes a long way, but I would buy this again and again.  This works 10 times better than products that cost 5 times as much.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for a great price.  I recently started using it and I am very impressed with the results so far.  I have dry skin and my face has improved dramatically.  It feels firm and my complexion is clearer and bright. Even my laugh lines have started to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommended this product and I am glad I found it on Amazon. I will indeed encourage others to try it.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot - it&#x27;s a great value, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most retinol products I have used. It doesn&#x27;t take very much, and you can feel the moisturizing effects after application. It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer, and I use it in the morning before makeup and at night before bed. The pump is easy to use, and allows you to dispense just a little or a lot. I highly recommend this moisturizer if you have had issues with retinol drying your skin in the past.</li>
    <li> So far so good! My skin is smooth, moist, and looking great. Only been using for about 2 weeks, and looking forward to further results!</li>
    <li> Retinol Surge Moisturizer is an excellent product. I have tried several other moisturizers over the years and I am very pleased with this one. The moisturizer has good texture, goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy. I just bought my fourth bottle and will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I wish I had better things to say...it&#x27;s not that I have bad things, I just don&#x27;t understand the reviews on here. The customer service is very good. I just don&#x27;t feel that this is typical retinol like other night/face creams have. I don&#x27;t think it did anything for my face. I think I had more breakouts than I did with Roc face creams. The customer service is good and the cream is a nice thickness and is in a good size bottle. Otherwise, I am very &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; about this cream. On to try something else.</li>
    <li> After only 2-3 weeks, noticed that my face felt much softer/smoother.  Non greasy, no odor. Have had no skin irritation at all.  What&#x27;s not to like!  Will purchase again.  Received an email from company even before I received the product, encouraging me to let them know if I had any issues, which I have not.  Delivery was speedy.</li>
    <li> wonderful it really works even on pimples they shrink!</li>
    <li> Good product, good company.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully well! I love the natural scent and the non-greasy feeling it leaves on your skin!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this! I use this together with their night time moisturizer and have had awesome results. My skin tends to be red and blotchy but after a few days of using this morning and night my skin is clear and very even toned. I am so happy with this product that I no longer have to wear foundation. Now that is what I call results. I highly recommend this product and I will definitely be reordering and tying their entire line:)</li>
    <li> I love the Body Merry line! I have very sensitive skin and will break out in hives at any moment, especially after trying many new products. This one has been great, goes on smooth, odorless, has a nice silky feel, and dries quickly without any oily or sticky residue. It adds a nice glow to my skin, and has even helped clear some of the residual acne breakouts/scars that I have, and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so now.  Will definitely purchase many times over!!!</li>
    <li> this products really moisturizes my dry skin I&#x27;m happy to have found this moisturizer,and fast delivery</li>
    <li> For years I have heard the benefits of retinol but never found the right products.. I am delighted that I discovered BODY MERRY moisturizer... It dispenses easily ...feels wonderful on my skin.. and at a very reasonable cost! I truly look forward to exploring the rest of the product line.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product for the first time, with a desire to find an effective regimen for my 58 year old face.  I&#x27;ve used many other moisturizers through the years, and thought that implementing a retinol formula would be helpful at this stage. I&#x27;ve been applying it each morning according to instructions, and in this summer sun, applying a sunscreen that is recommended on the bottle.  I also reapply it in the evening, massaging it in with upward, repeated strokes at the neck, from the chin up along my jaw and cheekbone, and from the bottom of my forehead, upward. I feel that my skin is looking pretty terrific, with a smoothness that I&#x27;m appreciating very much.  I will continue using this each day, and I additionally appreciate the generous amount that comes in the easy-pump bottle.  To offer a terrific formula in a generous amount, is smart for a cosmetics company to offer AND smart for the consumer to buy!  Thanks ALL!</li>
    <li> I used the directions which say to apply to your face and neck after cleansing and toning. If you use a serum apply that prior to this moisturizer. For dry or sensitive skin it is recommended to only use at night. Also if you have never used Retinol before it says to apply every other night until your skin is ready to use it daily.This is a nice not too thin but nice thicker cream which goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve used it in the morning and at night and like that it can be used under my makeup. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and more even toned.&lt;br /&gt;I received free sample for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I love this product and will be a repeat customer. I&#x27;ve yet to use it all but already notice a difference in the texture of my skin and it&#x27;s ability to retain moisture. Good stuff at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> This cream is so nice. It makes my face so much smoother and healthier looking since I have started using it. I will definitely be buying this cream again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Better than $100 moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference after using this product for a month.  Not sure I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I usually stack all my different serums on top of each other. This serum does two jobs in one, great idea and in a quality organic product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time. Pump is problematic as it does not push down for dispensing properly. The product itself is moisturizing...not greasy.  It can be worn under makeup without balling up. I have used day and night now for 4 days so long term results are pending. I am a 47 yr old female with no deep wrinkles and trying to prevent them. Will re evaluate product in 8 weeks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. Very happy with the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about two months and it is great. I put it on in the morning under my makeup (including a BB Cream with SPF 30). I tend to have easily irritated and dry skin and this moisturizer was gentle enough to avoid any irritation and it provided enough moisture. I have also noticed that the texture of my skin looks a lot better and my acne seems to be clearing up.</li>
    <li> I have only had this product for a few days and so far I love how it works. I first tried it on my hands and saw an immediate difference, fine lines have disappeared on my face too and I am 66 years old. Still waiting for better results which I am sure will show with a few more days of use.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer works on my oily skin. I try to only use a pea size. Otherwise it won&#x27;t absorb into my skin well. I use this along with Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair face Serum and eye repair. They work together. I like the slight changes in my skin and I will continue to use this as long as it continues to work on my skin without breaking me out. The changes in my skin so far include,  firmer skin and a more healthier even skin tone. I can&#x27;t attest to any changes on my fine lines as of yet.</li>
    <li> After I adjusted to the fact that this was more of a lotion than a serum,  I really began to like it and will definitely buy it again.  The pump applicator is great.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is great. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and works as well as some of the higher priced creams. It arrived as promised and the vendor has excellent customer service. I would highly recommend both the vendor and the product.</li>
    <li> Good product. I obtained good results - softer skin and somehow less noticeable wrinkles on forehead and around the eyes. I am 46, Hispanic and have fine lines. The only problem is the bottle/pump. Probably, mine was a little defective, after 5 or 6 uses of about double pea size, it&#x27;s hard to pump it and I know that it is not empty.</li>
    <li> Feels very good on skin. Pleasant fragrance. Caused slight break out in beginning, just use slowly because of retinol.</li>
    <li> Price dropped significantly because no sells, once you receive this product you will understand (and send it back!!) Reviews are scam, fake people reviewing it 10 times a day with 5 stars and fake descriptions( you just can feel its a scam). puke</li>
    <li> My first time using and I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product I use with retinol serum that combo works for me.&lt;br /&gt;no real skin irritation for me but I&#x27;m used to retinol.&lt;br /&gt;if you are new to retinol start slow like a few times a week until you get use to it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. .it is working on my skin..with only a few days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> This works fine but makes me sweat when I go out in the heat.</li>
    <li> Update to the below:  The most dramatic results were seen after continuous nightly use for 7 months.  It may be a long time, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a &#x27;wonder&#x27; cream out there that does permanent change overnight.  Great results with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using this long enough to review long term effects, but I can tell you the consistency and immediate results of the moisturizer are fantastic.  It&#x27;s very thick and creamy, soaks in well, and is not greasy at all.  I love it and am excited for future benefits to show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also wanted to add: Body Merry customer service is FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> A wonderful moisturizer that I like to use when I&#x27;m not using anything else on my face. It&#x27;s light and easy on your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong scent or heavy, waxy feel like body lotion does. A great value for this quality of lotion.</li>
    <li> All the 5* reviews are fake! I think all these 5* reviews are paid reviews&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this..and don&#x27;t waist your money</li>
    <li> Best anti aging  cream I have  ever  used. This is the only retinol cream that does not  burn  or irritate skin and  I am 60 years  old and this cream produces real results, will buy as long as it is available.  Body Merry has found a devoted  customer in me.</li>
    <li> Love Love this Moisturizer. I had some deep wrinkles around the Jaw line but after using this for 2 weeks the wrinkles are almost gone. Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month.  I really like it,  I live in the northeast and my skin is hydrated and soft.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a many many products and have found very few that I can wear during the day.  This goes on very nicely and does not leave your skin feeling oily or sticky.  I use it every day under CC cream.  My 50+ year old skin is looking better every day.  I am very happy and will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Item delievered as promised , love the way it feels I will order again.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice cream it is not as moisturizing as some lotions but it is a retinol moisturizer and it is winter so for now i will alternate with another lotion but this product is very nice quality. I would recommend it my face feels great and is perfect for just before makeup.</li>
    <li> Love it. Will buy again</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I just turned 40 and have spent years trying to find something that would not break me out with no luck so I gave up. Then I came across this product after I went for a facial and found out I may have Rosacea and would benefit from Retinol. So I tried this and it has reduced my redness, my wrinkles in my forehead have minimized a lot and my skin is super soft!!</li>
    <li> I use this cream twice a day (morning and night) It works well under makeup for day use. It leaves your skin soft and looking fresh.</li>
    <li> NO DIFFERENCE IN APPEARANCE</li>
    <li> Although this says it is a 2.5% retinol moisturizer, I didn&#x27;t find this to be particularly moisturizing.  I found it does not give the same results that a 2.5% serum does with a better moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose between this product and a 2.5% retinol serum with a good moisturizer, I&#x27;d choose the latter even though that would mean using 2 products instead of one. The retinol in this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be very active.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply do not see enough of a benefit in this product to put my reputation as a reviewer on the line to recommend this product. This is a small company trying to make their way, so I hope this review not only helps shoppers but also gives some much needed feedback to the company to maybe change formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Merry provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer! It goes on smoothly and leaves my skin better looking. I highly recommend this. The only way it could be better,  is if it were formulated with an SPF of 25 or higher.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied and very pleased!  At 62 years old (and a life-long sun lover!) using this product for just a few weeks has made my facial skin tone look even and bright.  Having tried many products at all levels of costs -- this is a great buy for the return!  I love it and will continue using it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I really love it!  My skin feels tighter and I&#x27;m starting to notice it even out.  I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments on my skin since I started using this.  I also love the way it makes my skin feel!  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice if it has helped with wrinkles/lines yet, so I rated it a 4 star product for now.  I will rate it again in several weeks and give comments on the wrinkles/lines results.  At this point, I would highly recommend this moisturizer...it&#x27;s definitely making a difference in my skin and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> Love this.  I use it morning and night and saw a difference within a week.  Definitely a &amp;#34;reorder&amp;#34; for me.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product. It goes on well and my skin it not reacting to it. I have been using the eye cream and thought I would try this I am glad I did. I haven&#x27;t found any moisturizers I have really liked or didn&#x27;t react to in a very long time.</li>
    <li> Only just got this but does a decent job. I like it because it sinks in and does not cause that all too familiar greasiness that some moisturizers can leave. So far so good. Downside the container for the product was somewhat broken when I got it due in part to the shipping packaging. I had to reassemble so far it seems to be working.</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using for several weeks and love the quality and results. Great price too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and almost didn&#x27;t order this but I am an advocate of the healthy ingredients and processes used so I decided to go for it.  I am happy that I did.  It&#x27;s been about 6 wks now and my skin feels wonderful.  The first two wks though I had to slow it back to 2-3 times a week, but now I am able to use it almost every night.  One thing that stands out is that my skin tone is more balanced.  I have good color anyway but the few sun spots on my cheeks have almost disappeared in this short period.  I came back looking for a product with sunscreen and to date they have not offered one.  That would be perfect.  I do not promote products unless I believe they work and I plan to buy more of this one. Great product.</li>
    <li> This s*** is magic in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  After spending alot of money on other moisturizers with none of them working, I&#x27;m happy to say this is great.  It&#x27;s the first moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that works great under foundation or mineral powders.  These go on smoothly with no streaking and last all day.&lt;br /&gt;Other &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; moisturizers cost $50-$100...this moisturizer is a bargain!</li>
    <li> Retinol Surge Moisturizer is a good daily face lotion. It keeps my face hydrated and feeling soft. I use it in the morning and at night after I wash my face. It has gave my face a nice heathly look. Probably from the collagen and green tea, and other good ingredients listed in the description.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a discount on this product for sharing my opinion.</li>
    <li> i love this product and use it daily!  It was a reorder and will continue to order if they have not discontinued it.  I couldn&#x27;t find it last week!  Great Moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> No smell. Not oily, good delivery device (the container is good in delivering exactly what you need).</li>
    <li> The cream smells very fresh and little cream spreads over a lot of area.</li>
    <li> Extreme irritation for my skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work miracles as everyone states but it is good at moisturising and has never burned or made my skin peel. It helps to slightly fade very small wrinkles. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it feels good on the skin. I am in my early 30&#x27;s and have fine lines forming around my mouth/nose area and in between my eyebrows. I have been using this product for a year now.</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law only uses this product and is crazy about it.</li>
    <li> Berry Merry Retinol Moisturizer works for me.  Since I have been using it, my skin is smoother and tighter.  It pumps out just the right amount of moisturizer to apply to my face which is quickly absorbed. I just apply my makeup over the product.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it because of the quality of the product and the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face for a couple of weeks now and notice a subtle improvement in my skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and at night. It glides on nicely and is light enough to use under my foundation. This product appears to work better than any other store purchases/products I&#x27;ve been using for years. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> After using the Body Merry serums for a few weeks, I incorporated the retinol moisturizer in my skin care regime a few days ago.  I use it once daily at night.  I think it&#x27;s a great complement to the retinol serum (locks it in, while moisturizing the skin after).  I&#x27;d use it in the morning as well, but it doesn&#x27;t have SPF. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully Body Merry will add a SPF moisturizer to their product line soon.</li>
    <li> I luv this product.  I will certainly order it again.  I use this every night, and my skin is amazing.</li>
    <li> big bottle great product that really works and great price</li>
    <li> I have to be honest and say that I did receive this Retinol Moisturizer for review, BUT I do really like this product! The Only problem I had with it is that it is extremely thick and takes a bit to soak into your skin. But once it did, my skin felt super soft and smooth! I have extremely sensative skin and this product didn&#x27;t bother me at all! I didn&#x27;t have break outs, I didn&#x27;t have any red blotchy skin and my skin didn&#x27;t itch from it, and that means so much to me in a product!! I would highly recommend this Moisturizer!!</li>
    <li> I am prone to acne and have oily skin. Finding a facial lotion that doesn&#x27;t break me out has been a nightmare. I am happy to say that this moisturizer has been a blessing. I have been using it twice a day for a month now and have not had any break outs whatsoever. I honestly cannot believe it. When I first received it I did not have much hope for it. But it really did prove me wrong. My face feels normal and has resolved a lot of the over oiliness of my skin. I do wear it under full foundation makeup without it interfering with it. I seriously love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;*Item received for testing and review purposes*</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing for overnight moisture and pre makeup moisture. It applies so  smooth and clean. I definitely recommend this! It is worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product at a reduced price in order to review it. I do not endorse or promote products I wouldn&#x27;t personally recommend to my friends or family.</li>
    <li> Bought this over a month ago, but didn&#x27;t use it right away. I wanted to finish my old cream first. After two uses - the pump no longer worked. There is no way to screw the top off either. I had to break the whole thing off to get to the cream. Now I have to use this and store this messy thing. There should be a longer return for items that are defective. I can&#x27;t imagine with the pump working, how you get the entire contents out. I would think a lot remains in the container when it gets near the bottom and there is no way to access that without a hassle and mess.</li>
    <li> I USE COUPON TO BUY THIS ITEM AND LEAVE MY HONEST REVIEW!&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;THE FIRS DAY I GOT IT,I USE IT.NO MORE DRY FEELING AND FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE&lt;br /&gt;I WILL KEEP USING IT,UPDATED MY SITUATION LATER!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  Inexpensive and it works.  I have noticed a significant change in my crow&#x27;s feet, laugh lines, and forehead lines - and that&#x27;s just after 3 weeks of use (one application in the morning and another application at night).  Also, no side effects like irritation or peeling.  It&#x27;s the perfect amount of retinol.  I&#x27;ve received several compliments on my skin and I tell everyone about this product.  Make sure to use sunscreen on top of the moisturizer during the day to get the maximum effect.</li>
    <li> Great product with a reasonable price! I will purchase it again.</li>
    <li> Definitely recommend - never had an issue or a breakout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to put sunscreen if you are fair - retinol increases your susceptibility to sunburns.</li>
    <li> This Retinol Surge Moisturizer by Body Merry appears to be an excellent product.  It absorbs quickly and makes the skin very smooth andsoft.  While it is too early to determine the long range outcome, I am very pleased to date.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream! Love it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.  It feels like silk on my skin and absorbs quickly too.  I will buy this again for sure!</li>
    <li> I received the Retinol Surge Moisturizer by Body Merry free for use and review.  First, I love the name of the company.  It sounds so happy and makes you want to use their products.  I knew this would be a good product, because I have already used an reviewed other various Body Merry products.  This particular retinol cream came in a generous size pump (3.4oz),  It was very easy to secure from the pump and the cream was white with a nice consistency,  not too thick and not too thin.  It really did not have a fragrance which can be nice so that you can continue using your own body spray or perfume without the scents clashing.  The main ingredients are 2.5% retinol, hyaluronic acid, vitamins b5 and 3 and green tea.  The cream was very easy to apply and the directions suggest twice a day use, morning under makeup and nigh before bed. However, since I was a first time retinol user, I only used I very other evening as directed.  The cream felt very light on my face and it did not feel like I was wearing anything extra.  here was no burning or irritation.  I was slightly worried as I heard that retinol can sometimes be too abrasive.  I did notice it made my skin smoother and it did appear t take away some of those fine lines and wrinkles.  This is a product I would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM8674f7f58293a364502f1d2a6502a3e1&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
    <li> A little to thick and greasy but i love retinol products so if you have dry skin and use creams already this might work great for you. I personally prefer the serums.</li>
    <li> I got this item for review.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this moisturizer it feels nice in my skin not a lot of moisturizers that i purchase do that so i was glad i got this.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. The results I saw were great and you can actually see a difference in the skin without having to look for it. The moisturizer is so simple to apply and leaves only a slight residue feel after use. It isn&#x27;t enough to be disturbing and you don&#x27;t notice it after a few minutes. There is also a slight scent to this, but, for me it was not enough to matter. It isn&#x27;t strong or distasteful, just enough to notice. The Retinol Moisturizer leaves your skin feeling soft and supple without a lot of hassle.It literally takes only seconds to apply.  I used this as directed and had no problems or skin irritations. I saw much better results from this than other products I have tried and I plan to continue using it to see the maximum results. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free sample item for review purposes. All opinions are from my personal use and experience.</li>
    <li> When you pump out this serum use a full pump to a pump and a half. You take this moisturizer and apply it to your face neck. Let&#x27;s get into the quality of the product and a few ingredients. The first ingredients are organic aloe vera.  I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!This is a natural plant that use to help me with scrapes and burns. So I figure if it is good enough for our grandmas to put on burns and scrapes, it is good to put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also organic sunflower oil and palm oil. In addition to the oils there is shea butter and green tea. The product has antioxidants to help with making the skin look feel younger. I have been using this for a little while now and I am noticing tighten and brightening of the skin. My skin is looking smoother in texture, which I am loving.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this one. It has the best consistency and texture, a very soothing and creamy feel. It glides on smoothly and is not too thick to massage in. There is no irritation or burning in case you were wondering due to the Retinol. The scent is mild and I feel like it is quite hydrating yet not greasy. I recently have been using this one in the day time mostly since it absorbs very quickly and give me the extra hydration I need right now in the cooler weather. The pump is the best cause you can pump out the smallest amount or a full pump if you wanted to, very easy to control. You only need about 1/4 to 1/2 a pump for your face, but could go back and apply an extra layer after it absorbs for the extra moisturization. There is no spf, and you will still need to add that if you choose to, but I use this first and I usually have spf in my foundation. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
    <li> I became obsessed with trying different beauty products available via Amazon. Not all products with good reviews are actually good. So I keep ordering more products hoping to find a good one.  Recently I ordered Retinol  Moisturizer and was pleasantly surprised. It makes my skin very soft and hydrated. I started using it twice a day on my face and neck. It&#x27;s better than any other moisturizer I used. I will certainly purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to try the 2.5% Retinol Moisturizer and give my honest opinion of the product. It is an amazing product. It goes on my face so smooth and make it soft and doesn&#x27;t clog up my pores or anything like that. Over the couple of weeks I could really see results, my skin was tighter than before. The lotion goes along way, all that I needed was one or two pumps of the lotion each time that I would apply it so it lasts a long time which is great.</li>
    <li> Makes my face a little oily but you can&#x27;t really tell. I didn&#x27;t notice until my boyfriend kissed my forehead and said it was &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; lol.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it daily, and only have positive things to say about it. My skin is much softer and feels hydrated.</li>
    <li> So I am a GUY, and yes I use this product. WHY? Well for one I saw all the great reviews, and I thought a bulls*** scam!!! But I was like, okay buy it and forget it. No biggie, out less that what I pay for a dinner for two. But first my skin became smooth, with rosacea. Surprisingly! You have no idea what I have used to help my skin tone. Not a miracle worker at first, but wait till you read the review. So I saw my skin become smooth, but it didn&#x27;t take away the wrinkles. I kept using the bottle, and after about a week I noticed slight changes. The skin tone started to morph into a better complexion. Then after about a week and a half, of constant use each day. My wrinkles under my eyes started to decline. At first I thought I was just getting more rest, but they were disappearing. No one can convince you that this is the almighty fountain of youth, but I can convince you that this is the closest I have found. Skin is moist, flexible, and wrinkle cutting. For deeper wrinkles on my forehead it took more time for them to decline, but now I look and I have to really look after three weeks of constant use each day. Best things I can suggest, exfoliate, cleanse and then use this product and then sunscreen. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but damn! Thank you, any new products from your company I am willing to try.!!!!</li>
    <li> I thought the company was very professional to send an email prior to receiving the product with directions on how to use it. I have followed along with the use of a serum before the application of the Retinol and have not had any irritation. I was originally not sure if this product would be too harsh for my skin since since I am a red-head with fair/sensitive skin however I have been able to use the product twice a day without any problems.</li>
    <li> Great product. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer for a couple weeks now. I&#x27;ve stuck to just using it in the morning so I wouldn&#x27;t get the redness from the retinol. I&#x27;m liking it so far. It leaves my face soft and is a great base for makeup. I have oily skin and the moisturizer isn&#x27;t heavy at all.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product, the size is so generous, and it feels so good in the skin. In my case I feel it a little oily, I would like to have a formula for oily skin and Non-comedogenic. I don&#x27;t have lot of time using it so I don&#x27;t know how much it help with wrinkles, that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Scam alert.  Look at the dates of all the 5 and 4 star reviews.  All the same date periods, too obvious and suspicious.  I wish I had noticed that before.  When the product arrived the cream was leaking all over on the inside of the cap.  Weird.  Ok, I&#x27;ll give it a try anyway.  This is hand lotion I&#x27;m almost positive.  I&#x27;ve used real retinol cream before and I know what it feels like (slight tingling etc).  This didn&#x27;t feel anything like that.  2.5% Retinol?  For this price?  Body Merry?  Never heard of it.  I gave it a try and now I realize if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  This is not only fake, but it arrived leaking.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
    <li> I find the retinol surge moisturizer to be quite effective.  My skin feels dewy and soft for most of the day and then it’s time to clean my face again for evening and reapply the moisturizer.  I like it and appreciate your product!  - PJ</li>
    <li> I am seriously loving this moisturizer. Though I am fairly young, I do have some signs of aging on my face. A couple of lines here and there. I had read about all of the benefits that Retinol has so I though, &amp;#34;What the heck. I&#x27;ll try it.&amp;#34; After about a week of using this moisturizer, I really noticed a difference. The small lines that I had started to look less and less noticeable. My pores also looked way smaller too. I&#x27;m really loving this moisturizer and my face has never looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I got this product for free in exchanged to test and review honestly. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the BEST ORGNIC vitamin C Serum. There was no difference to my skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizer! I only got this a few days ago, but I already see a huge difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products for my acne, and this is one of the most promising moisturizers so far. I used a Tretinoin gel previously, which really worked, but I wanted something more long-term, like this product. I didn&#x27;t really know what Tretinoin was all about, but it led me here.&lt;br /&gt;How I use this product: both in the morning with a sunscreen (Elta MD UV Shield SPF 45), and at night, right after my facial wash. I must say, my skin looks tighter and brighter! The ingredients are very pleasant, as my skin is very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would get this again. Perhaps I&#x27;ll edit my review after more time has passed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the moisturizer, eye cream and serum for just two weeks and my skin is already thanking me.  I am 42 years old and suffer from dry, itchy skin.  My skin feels tighter, softer, and perfectly hydrated.  The dark circles under my eyes are less prominent.  I am able to go without makeup once again.  You can&#x27;t beat the price or the results.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin; however, this product does not leave me shining. I have used other retinol products so this one has not caused any irritation.</li>
    <li> I love the Body Merry product that I purchased all the way from the consistency of the product to the dispenser it comes in. I like the one pump idea. Another positive of this product is that it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes if I happen to get it close to them. I will only buy animal-friendly products so I am very glad I found this line. In fact I like this product so much I will now begin shopping Body Merry for more products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank again for asking. Love this product.</li>
</ol>
