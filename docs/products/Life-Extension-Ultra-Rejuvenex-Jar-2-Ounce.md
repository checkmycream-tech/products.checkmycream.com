### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>/&gt;This is the best skin care product I have ever taken, and I have been using it for about 7 years.</li>
      <li>Rejuvenex works into my skin and it appears flawless!</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this cream, I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula</li>
      <li>GREAT AMAZON.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a good moisturizer and had ordered the AuraVie kit and ran out of the replenish moisturizer but didnt have the cash</li>
      <li>but I also keep my skin looking good.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased this product before and loved it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
      <li>has its own set of benefits.</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I use this product every morning and it feels very smooth, non-oily and rejuvenating to my skin.</li>
      <li>My favorite moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Probably the most diverse ingredients for the price.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m sure the Rejeuvenex cream has helped give me a more youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this cream also the serum too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many creams.  </li>
      <li>I have used this cream for about 4 months and believe it has kept my skin healthy.</li>
      <li>I am glad to find it on amazon, where it is so easy to shop.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The differences to my skin were noticeable very quickly.  </li>
      <li>While I have always been very pleased with Amazon, this particular vendor, Rejuvenex, also practices customer scamming and does not deserve to be rewarded!</li>
      <li>Rejuvenex products are also available in \\&quot;sample\\&quot; sizes.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT,AND REALLY HELPS WITH SKIN WRINKLES AND FINE LINES.  </li>
      <li>I have mild rosacea and it takes away the inflammatory issues with my skin.  </li>
      <li>I am a fan of this product particularly because it is reasonably priced and it is supported by sound research.</li>
      <li>FIRST FIND OUT ABOUT THIS CREAM FROM MY DERMATOLOGIST.  </li>
      <li>Have been using this for 3 weeks, It is very creamy and light and makes my skin soft.</li>
      <li>Within days I had four large blemishes</li>
      <li>IT REALLY WORKS.  </li>
      <li>really well rested.  </li>
      <li>True I had recently got my hair cut and styled</li>
      <li>Normally to get this product at this price you have to be a member of LEF.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a non profit that sells supplements below market value to members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rejuvenex really helps in the daily skin regiem not to mention my wife loves that its keeping the skin around the eyes and cheeks</li>
      <li>As I get on in years, 59 yrs old, I not only continue to fitness train</li>
      <li>Expensive, but does a nice job.  </li>
      <li>I have to push the whole thing back down tostart over.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for several months.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I saw a difference within a week.  Was recommended by my Wellness doctor.  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 3 weeks, It is very creamy and light and makes my skin soft. It has no greasy residue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many creams.  Finally I&#x27;ve found one that actually works.  After using Rejuvenex for a couple of months friends and colleagues would tell me I looked really well rested.  Recently, I was out at a restaurant and a friend I hadn&#x27;t seen in about six months said I looked younger and  made a point of it, even jokingly asked if I work done.  True I had recently got my hair cut and styled but I&#x27;m sure the Rejeuvenex cream has helped give me a more youthful look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been very happy with this cream, I just hope they don&#x27;t change the formula</li>
    <li> As I get on in years, 59 yrs old, I not only continue to fitness train but I also keep my skin looking good.  Rejuvenex really helps in the daily skin regiem not to mention my wife loves that its keeping the skin around the eyes and cheeks firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re gonna focus on body fitness, include this product in your skin fitness.</li>
    <li> Normally to get this product at this price you have to be a member of LEF.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a non profit that sells supplements below market value to members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best skin care product I have ever taken, and I have been using it for about 7 years. When I started getting the occasional grey hair, I noticed that this made my hair color darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The differences to my skin were noticeable very quickly.  It seemed to have a slight exfoliant effect, lines started disappearing and my skin looks younger and well moisturised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you care to look at the list of ingredients which you can do online, it&#x27;s quite impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you will like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you find this review helpful.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer. Probably the most diverse ingredients for the price. If only they would include Vitamin B3 (niacinamide). Rejuvenex won&#x27;t really rejuvenate your old skin, but it will help soften and slow down the decline.</li>
    <li> I love this cream also the serum too.</li>
    <li> Rejuvenex works into my skin and it appears flawless! It makes my skin softer and wrinkles seem to be diminished!</li>
    <li> I like this cream a lot -- it does seem to hydrate my skin well and I like the ingrediants. I have used this cream for about 4 months and believe it has kept my skin healthy.</li>
    <li> FIRST FIND OUT ABOUT THIS CREAM FROM MY DERMATOLOGIST.  HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR THREE YEARS NOW.  IT DOES HELP WITH WRINKLES AND CROWS FEET.  IT IS A PRODUCT I HIGLY RECOMMEND.  AMAZON HAS IT FOR $10.00 LESS THAN THE DOCTORS OFFICE.  IT REALLY WORKS.  YOU WILL DEFINITELY NOTICE THE DIFFERENCE AFTER ABOUT A WEEK OF USING IT.  MY DERMATOLOGIST USES IT ON HIS SKIN,SO IT DOES SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> Rejuvenex products are also available in \\&quot;sample\\&quot; sizes. I ordered a $5 sample, only to have my checking account raped of almost $200! I&#x27;ve had numerous unresolved complaints with this company,who still refuses to return my money. (All product was returned, at personal cost) While I have always been very pleased with Amazon, this particular vendor, Rejuvenex, also practices customer scamming and does not deserve to be rewarded!</li>
    <li> I use this product every morning and it feels very smooth, non-oily and rejuvenating to my skin. At night I use the Ultra Night cream. I am a fan of this product particularly because it is reasonably priced and it is supported by sound research.</li>
    <li> The jar comes out of the bottom holder when I unscrew it. I have to push the whole thing back down tostart over. It&#x27;s quite annoying.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good moisturizer and had ordered the AuraVie kit and ran out of the replenish moisturizer but didnt have the cash so I went with this product.  Within days I had four large blemishes and I NEVER break out.  I have fairly dry skin and a porcelain complexion.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
    <li> Cream was all on one side of jar and oil had separated from cream.  I have purchased this product before and loved it but this was very disappointing.  I need a replacement because this jar of cream looks like something happened to it.</li>
    <li> This cream was recommended to me three yeAS AGO BY MY DERMATOLOGIST. THIS IS A FABULOUS PRODUCT,AND REALLY HELPS WITH SKIN WRINKLES AND FINE LINES.  DO NOT HESITATE TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM.  GREAT AMAZON.  YOU HAVE IT FOR $10.00 THAN WHAT I WAS PAYING AT THE DOCTOR&#x27;S OFFICE.SUPER PRODUCT AND DELIVERY WAS WITHIN A FEW DAYS.</li>
    <li> waste of money this cream did absolutely nothing....DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Expensive, but does a nice job.  We use different lotions/creams for different problems.&lt;br /&gt;Each has its own set of benefits. Penitrix is another cream which we like which comes in a very similar bottle,</li>
    <li> I have used this face lotion for years, and would not switch to anything else.  I have mild rosacea and it takes away the inflammatory issues with my skin.  I am glad to find it on amazon, where it is so easy to shop.</li>
    <li> Not sure how well it works yet</li>
