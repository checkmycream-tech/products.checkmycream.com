      <li>tHE REVIEWS MAKE IT SOUND AWESOME</li>
      <li>Nice cool/neutral tone contour color not orange at all .</li>
      <li>It blends great and is a good natural color.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t love it for my fair skin tone with cool undertones.</li>
      <li>In person it looks ok but in pics it looks like I have a bruise on my face.</li>
      <li>Love the bronzer, what I was looking for..</li>
      <li>On the top of it it broke me out.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s more like a sample size</li>
      <li>iT OK</li>
      <li>This one is ok.</li>
      <li>I Love this.</li>
      <li>Love the color...</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly as well.</li>
      <li>The product blends pretty well and looks like a slightly warm (it is a bronzer, after all) shadow which made my cheekbones pop.  </li>
      <li>These are free samples.</li>
      <li>A light dusting on my forehead (or five-head in my case)</li>
      <li>Buildable and pigmented and have a matte light brown color</li>
      <li>nice, natural contour in face and nose...</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it for the price, find it cheaper elsewhere or just pay for the full size somewhere else.</li>
      <li>beautiful matte color.. will most likely get the bigger version.</li>
      <li>Luckily, I purchased the mini size to sample how it looks.</li>
      <li>It says right</li>
      <li>Small but a great tester rather then spending $30.</li>
      <li>my first thought was, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it?&amp;#34;  </li>
      <li>But the great thing is that I found it in this little trial size to try before I committed to purchasing the big size.</li>
      <li>BUT HONESTLY ITS NO BETTER THAN DRUGSTORE BRANDS.</li>
      <li>the contours look pretty natural.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Not sure if I&#x27;m just not blending it good enough</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m new to using bronzer</li>
      <li>It was brand new never been opened.</li>
      <li>Also think it is more indicated for very pale skin, if you have any color in your face it just gets lost.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a little light for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this product and i really like it.</li>
      <li>it looks so natural for any skin tone</li>
      <li>A little disheartened by the size I was still excited to try it out.  </li>
      <li>Most of the year I have fairly pale skin, but on the warmer side, thanks to my Asian half.</li>

    <li> Not Impressed. Its a really tiny sample size product. You can not even swirl your brush in it. On the top of it it broke me out. I would suggest to stay away from this item. Not worth spending 11 dollars.</li>
    <li> Best Bronzer I have ever worn. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> tHE REVIEWS MAKE IT SOUND AWESOME BUT HONESTLY ITS NO BETTER THAN DRUGSTORE BRANDS. iT OK</li>
    <li> Small but a great tester rather then spending $30. on the big one.</li>
    <li> I Love this. it is my favorite bronze powder!! it looks so natural for any skin tone i think i will definalty be buying the actual size &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> beautiful matte color.. will most likely get the bigger version.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product and i really like it. It blends great and is a good natural color. I received it very quickly as well. I will definitely be getting the larger size next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to using bronzer but I wanted to contour and I&#x27;m on the search for the perfect one. This one is ok. In person it looks ok but in pics it looks like I have a bruise on my face. Not sure if I&#x27;m just not blending it good enough but I don&#x27;t love it for my fair skin tone with cool undertones. But the great thing is that I found it in this little trial size to try before I committed to purchasing the big size.</li>
    <li> Meh. I think it&#x27;s a little light for my skin tone. Luckily, I purchased the mini size to sample how it looks.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously small for the price.  Can&#x27;t recommend it for the price, find it cheaper elsewhere or just pay for the full size somewhere else. Also think it is more indicated for very pale skin, if you have any color in your face it just gets lost.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great for contouring.</li>
    <li> WARNING!!  These are free samples. It says right no the package they are not for sale. Don&#x27;t buy this illegally sold product. You can probably go to Benefit and ask for the sample..</li>
    <li> Love the bronzer, what I was looking for.. Just in small version.</li>
    <li> Love the color...just didn&#x27;t know it was gunna be so small...it&#x27;s more like a sample size</li>
    <li> This is pretty small and I&#x27;m the person that&#x27;s addicted to bronzer but I have a vision that even this trial size is going to last me a long time. It&#x27;s a little hard to open at first but it&#x27;s perfect for my skin color and it&#x27;s like a one size fits al bronzer. Buildable and pigmented and have a matte light brown color so it won&#x27;t look as if you have a 5 o clock shadow on your skin. Perfect ! Recommend this to everyone !</li>
    <li> It was only after looking at the package that came in the mail did the words &amp;#34;Mini Trial Size&amp;#34; actually sink in.  It was also one of those situations where I asked myself, &amp;#34;Isn&#x27;t this one of those items where it should be labeled &#x27;Not For Individual Sale&#x27;?&amp;#34;  Folks, that seems to be the case here.  I should have just womaned-up and bought the regular sized version since I&#x27;ve heard nothing but rave reviews on YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I received the envelope in the mail and poured the contents out into my hand my first thought was, &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it?&amp;#34;  A little disheartened by the size I was still excited to try it out.  Like any quality makeup, a little goes a long way.  Most of the year I have fairly pale skin, but on the warmer side, thanks to my Asian half. Due to the smallness of the package, I had to maneuver my brush around to get it evenly dusted--and I mean dusted (you don&#x27;t want to coat your brush).  After tapping off the excess I made my mark.  And then blended.  The product blends pretty well and looks like a slightly warm (it is a bronzer, after all) shadow which made my cheekbones pop.  A light dusting on my forehead (or five-head in my case) and I am good to go!  Because there is no shimmer (yay!) the contours look pretty natural.</li>
    <li> It was brand new never been opened. Nice cool/neutral tone contour color not orange at all .</li>
    <li> nice, natural contour in face and nose...</li>
