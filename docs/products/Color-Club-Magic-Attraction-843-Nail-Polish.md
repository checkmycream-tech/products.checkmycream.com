<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect amount of sparkle!!!</li>
    <li> It looks nice but didn&#x27;t really cover very well. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Doesn&#x27;t really look like the picture.</li>
    <li> Very pretty nail polish. It does take a few coats to make it opaque but I expected that. Ive heard its very hard to get glittery nail polish off but this was very easy with nail polish remover. I recommend getting this.</li>
    <li> I love the sparkle and glitter and depth of this polish!  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to sparkle!</li>
    <li> Great color, goes on well and is super sparkly!  As with any glitter, it&#x27;s a b to remove, but that&#x27;s the price you pay for beauty!</li>
    <li> I love this glitter polish! I use it has a accent to different colors or I will polish my ring finger with just it, adds a lil pop to my mani n pedi&#x27;s. It only takes 2 coats to get full coverage. What you see in the picture is what you get. It&#x27;s beautiful!</li>
    <li> I do like this but it&#x27;s not as shiny as I like.  The background is kind of milky white but the various colors do give me the look I wanted.  I wish it were in a silver-y background and I would probably like it better.  However - I DO wear it and I DO get complements on it.  Try it!  For this price how wrong can you go!</li>
    <li> I love glitter nail polish.  This one stays on longer than most and shines and sparkles for a long time it does not get cloudy like some.</li>
    <li> Great for an accent/party nail!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful polish looks amazing as a french tip, or as an overlay polish! As with all color club polishes that I have found they do tend to chip a lot, problem is easily solved with a good base coat. Or layering the polish over a similar or contrasting color :]</li>
    <li> Came out great on my nails and lasted a long time. Gotta love the sparkles! This will be a great addition to my collection.</li>
    <li> This polish is absolutely beautiful! I love it!</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful! I would like to say it&#x27;s one of the best glitter polishes I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Love this polish!!! Ive used it a bunch of times already. It doesn&#x27;t chip off that easily and looks super cute!</li>
    <li> This is a 3D glitter, not a holographic like stated, if you are into 3D it would be a great buy</li>
    <li> Absolutely love the color and the sparkle to it, but it peels and chips really bad I have to re apply daily</li>
    <li> has to be my favorite always go back to this one toes or fingers looks great and will pop even more with a little clear on them also helps to smooth out nail as this one feels a little like sand paper with out the clear but wait til this one is good and dry before applying the clear most of the time only takes one coat as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you go girl</li>
    <li> The polish is very stylish and pretty. The only bad thing about this polish is the struggle getting it off clean. The polish doesn&#x27;t come off easy. Thank you.</li>
    <li> the nail polish has great coverage and looks like the pic.  this is not a clear polish with glitter in it... it actually looks like the pic!!!.  i bought this for my daughter for christmas and she loves it!!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! Beautiful in person!!!! Yes this is a nice one!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! 2 coats and you&#x27;re good to go! It is beautiful when light hits it. I never had an issue with it chipping like some of the other people. Maybe you&#x27;re applying to many coats, or not letting each coat dry completely? This is my second bottle and I will continue to buy more! Love all color club nail polishes.</li>
    <li> This applies really well.. I always use a base and top coat. I really like to choose different colors underneath and apply this one on top and it looks great.</li>
    <li> gorgeous color on nails with any shade. Love to mix it up and use this as nail art on my top coat. It is so beautiful this polish can simply be wore alone. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love it but hard to get off. I used my nail grinder which did the trick</li>
    <li> GREAT NAIL POLISH, WEARS WELL, LASTS LONG! RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT LIKES SPARKLY NAILS AND LONG WEARING SHADES FOR TWO WEEKS OR LONGER.</li>
    <li> This color is definitely not cute. I thought it would be a unique glitter but it&#x27;s very common.  Did not like it at all.</li>
    <li> There were a lot of complaints about this polish in that is peels and doesn&#x27;t stay on even with a topcoat.  I buy a lot of glittery polishes (that part is beautiful) so I took this polish and mixed it up (I love mixing colored glitters) with some of my other glitters and this seemed to do the trick. I also add a top coat and then another coat of the polish and another of the top coat. So for all those who complain about peeling try this or add to a soft color like silver or pink - the glitter should come through and wouldn&#x27;t peel because it has been mixed and it&#x27;s not standing on its own. I just ordered two more bottles (I now have four) and I really love it. A lot of my glitter polishes are larger sparkles so this interacts with the larger and comes out  a beautiful mixture of the two. Check it out. OPI has a number of glittery polishes and try the search engine for more - that should help immensely with the peeling problem! Good luck!!!</li>
    <li> Item got delivered quickly. Polish color matches picture and was in good condition when package arrived . The polish was a bit sticky and gooey. Had to add acetone to make it a bit more runny.</li>
    <li> Love it got a lot of complements on it</li>
    <li> This is probably one of the prettiest polishes I have ever owned. The only thing is, it is really hard to come off.</li>
    <li> I am big Nail Art Fan.  This polish is so cute on and a great base coat by itself or with stamping.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo332WRXKYNA0R]]I bought this to replace an older holographic polish I had, and I love it! It&#x27;s just as good, so far and the color is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I am getting more as soon as I can! Reminds me of a beach.</li>
    <li> Long wearing sparkly polish. I like to paint one or two fingernails with this as an accent color</li>
    <li> I really like this polish, it give good coverage.</li>
    <li> Another great holo from color club! Everyone should buy!</li>
    <li> *******Update**********&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this polish on me and a few others and the consensus is that this polish peels badly.  Even when I added a strong base and top coat this polish acts like Cheap, dried paint and chips off.  It will actually do it on the whole nail sometimes.  I really love the color but this brand has a chipping problem.  If anyone knows a solution please let me know.&lt;br /&gt;********Original***********&lt;br /&gt;I thought the product was a base color with glitter inside.  It is actually the glitter only.  It works well as a overlay polish on a solid color.  It is a very sparkly polish and people will notice it.  The only thing I noticed is that if you use it alone with no base coat it will chip and come off within one day.  It also has a rough texture, so make sure that you use a base coat and put on a solid top coat.  I actually have to do this with all Color Club polishes.  Other than that I love their brand.</li>
    <li> This polish is very true to the picture and is great alone, or over a different color.&lt;br /&gt;Giltter is super vivid and catches light nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Turned out to be just the product I was searching for. Great brand, will definitely buy more colors!</li>
    <li> My favorite sparkly nail polish! Couple coats of this and it&#x27;s like a glitter bomb went off on your nails. LOVE IT! Best glitter polish I&#x27;ve gotten.</li>
    <li> Pretty and easy to use</li>
    <li> Great price, product, and shipping arrival timing!</li>
    <li> Its so sparkly and glam with out being kiddish very good for hidding nicks and doesn&#x27;t chip I have fake nails and looks professional day after day even during my physical job</li>
    <li> I ablsolutley love this !! it is so sparkly. it is a little bit rough texture, but when you put a clear coat on it you don&#x27;t even notice.</li>
    <li> This is a matte finish, sparkly if you use a nice topcoat and the color is as shown. A very nice array of colors to use on a night out on the town. I recommend two coats to get it looking exactly as in the photo.</li>
    <li> This nail polish breaks ast, if it just falls out of your hand is splatters all over the floor. Yack,</li>
    <li> This color, Magic Attraction, is simply amazing! Wonderful along with 2 coats and near full coverage. Lovely with one thin coat over lavender or dark purple, and any pink. I&#x27;ll be trying it over black next- yea, sounds like an odd color to try it on- but it truly is an amazing versatile fine glitter polish. It&#x27;s my go to polish when i don&#x27;t know what to wear. When worn by itself, it&#x27;s a really light color which goes with anything and any style of dress- yet has enough bling to it to satisfy your nail obsession if you can&#x27;t wear something a bit more dramatic yet still want something eye catching. I will be buying another bottle when this one is used up. I HIGHLY reccommend this nail polish and i wish I could find it in stores.</li>
    <li> This is a really sparkly holographic nail polish. Really liked the consistency coverage was good with two coats. so if you can find it great</li>
    <li> I received this product yesterday. Best nail polish I have in my collection. Its long lasting,sparkly,and a great price. I love it</li>
    <li> It is nice shinny and to my surprise it dried fast. I am very happy I ordered it and would be ordering more..........!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this glitter polish!  nice colors!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is pretty good, but is not as thick or as sparkly as the images and reviews might suggest.</li>
    <li> I am super pleased with this polish, so pleased that felt compelled to write a review. I&#x27;d been looking at a much more expensive holo that had very fussy application instructions and came in a teeny-tiny quantity. I am so glad I picked this Color Club version instead! The application is very easy; I love how fast it dries. I&#x27;ve actually found it applied best with no based coat. Three layers gives you full coverage like you see in the product photo. (One layer is a very pretty addition to a base color.) The texture of the finished nail is VERY rough but a top coat does not diminish the sparkle like with some other holo polishes. It sucks up top coat and I actually apply top coat three times to get a smooth, shiny finish. I have not had trouble with chipping and I&#x27;m a work-from-home mom who uses and washes her hands a LOT. Lastly, the color and holo effect is very nice. It&#x27;s gorgeous in sunlight, pretty in bright artificial light and not very noticeable in dim light. All in all, I&#x27;m a big fan!</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish  its very different from the other glitter nail polishes i have i love the way it looks in the light very sparkly!</li>
    <li> This nail Polish was a bit pricey. I could&#x27;ve purchased something very similar at Walmart, Walgreens, or beauty supply store. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She enjoys painting her nails.</li>
    <li> Loved this polish. Lasted a while with minomal chipping and the color is absolutely wonderful. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it again!</li>
    <li> Goes on really thick and pasty. Not really a color that you can wear alone, which was disappointing for me.</li>
    <li> This polish is full of sparkly magic! Its like unicorn magic bottled LOL! But seriously this polish is chocked full of holographic glitters in a clear base. There is a ton of glitter in this so its a nice dense glitter polish of awesomeness. Super beautiful and can be opaque in 2-3 coats. I really love this polish very happy with it!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly and looks just like the picture. Great price for the product.  The polish does peel a little bit that&#x27;s why I gave 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Great 3d color, of all my recent nail color purchases this is my favorite polish, 2 coats are needed !</li>
    <li> This is the best holo polish I&#x27;ve ever used!! I put it on last week and no chips or peeling and great color. Chunky holo is realy hard to find.....REAL holo. Im going back to order 3 more bottles just so I have a stash should it be sold out or discontinued.  Definitely recommend this polish. Also very quickly delivered. A must have for the summer.</li>
    <li> I love how fast I received the nail polish in the mail! The only downside is that when I tried it, I took a few coats to get the full effect. Other than that, I love the color!! :D</li>
    <li> My new favorite glitter polish! Only really takes two coats, but I usually do a third for that extra sparkle. Love it and get a lot of compliments on it. It&#x27;s the perfect accent nail and looks amazing on toes! (:</li>
    <li> This polish looks REALLY good. Very happy with it</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this polish to everyone who loves sparkle its so shiny and glittery love it  got here just in time too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always kind of nervous when ordering a new brand of nail polish, but this is amazing. The color is exacyly as shown really pretty, and stays on for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is nice polish. It has more of a slight purple tint than you can tell from the picture. It holds well (like most glitters). Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love using this color as a tip, it looks just like the acylic powder but just not as damaging. it also looks beautiful on the whole nail. its just an amazing color</li>
    <li> This polish is very cute but you do have to put on multiple coats to get it to look nice...</li>
    <li> you&#x27;ll LOVE this!!! It&#x27;s a beautiful sparkly color.</li>
    <li> This polish looks exactly as it appears in the picture. It&#x27;s very fine glitter, super sparkly and a perfect compliment to almost any color nail polish. It does have a very fine, grainy texture and definitely needs a good top coat. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;m well out of high school, I still love all things glitter and this polish is perfect for my must have nail quirks. It isn&#x27;t clear polish with glitter in it; this polish can actually stand on its own much  like the picture.</li>
    <li> This is some beautiful polish! And it dries super fast! But it chips and peels BAD! I mean really bad! :( Back to the drawing board!</li>
    <li> I love glitter nail polish, and this might be my favorite.  It&#x27;s so pretty!  I just paint the tips of my nails and it looks great!</li>
    <li> This stuff is like pure glitter in a bottle - not like normal glitter polish that takes some daubing and multiple coats.  This is probably the most densly glittery polish I&#x27;ve ever had (and I love it!).</li>
