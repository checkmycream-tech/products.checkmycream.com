      <li>I love OPI products.</li>
      <li>I ended up keeping it for myself and buying three more for more of my friends.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite OPI colors.</li>
      <li>Need I say more?</li>
      <li>It will go with many things.</li>
      <li>nothing to love about though</li>
      <li>I love almost all the colors.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it already and got many compliments</li>
      <li>I love OPI nail polish,  it lasts and lasts and lasts and lasts.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite color.</li>
      <li>This color is like a true navy, which i freakishly LOVE!</li>
      <li>Very cool color.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend - surprisingly neutral color, goes with everything I wear :).  </li>
      <li>Fabulous color.</li>
      <li>It is a deep navy and looks great with a champange accent nail.  </li>
      <li>my 20 year old niece loved it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s typical of OPI&#x27;s excellent quality - dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t chip away.</li>
      <li>It really is amazing beautiful and stays on for at least 2 weeks</li>
      <li>OPI&#x27;s outstanding quality and the color is pretty</li>
      <li>I was super excited to see it in person.</li>
      <li>Great alternative to black</li>
      <li>You can get away with one coat, but two looks better - deep and rich.</li>
      <li>Picture color is true to real color.  </li>
      <li>A real, true navy blue.  </li>
      <li>When I first saw this color while looking for OPI nail lacquers</li>
      <li>then they take a closer look and see that it&#x27;s a beautiful dark blue</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m addicted to changing and re painting my nails lol</li>
      <li>I really like it and it wears well.  </li>
      <li>I love this dark color</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a bold blue.</li>
      <li>I will try just one coat to try to get a more blue color next time.  </li>
      <li>I clean pretty often and am pretty rough on my nails so my mark for a lasting polish is three days and Incognito Un Sausalito holds up very well in three day test.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a very classy, wear-with-anything color.</li>
      <li>I do love dark blue nail polish.</li>
      <li>I just thought it would be a little more obviously navy.</li>
      <li>use with any clear polish of your choice</li>
      <li>the color comes off sorta black green, unless u show it off in the light where u can se that nice navy blue, the long wear only last a few days, so it was okay,</li>
      <li>The color packs a powerful punch without it being too dark.</li>
      <li>At first people will ask if it&#x27;s black</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not even funny if I could wear this everyday</li>

<li> One only sees a slight hint of blue in certain lights; otherwise, it comes off as a black color in my opinion.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s very dark, but you can tell it&#x27;s not black.</li>
<li> really dark but on it looks amazeing</li>
<li> but make sure you use a base coat as this color stains your nails.</li>
<li> I applied two coats, and it is very nearly black.  </li>
<li> I usually apply with OPI Nail Envy Matte for a base coat, two coats of polish, and Seche Vite top coat.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very subtle.  </li>
<li> Let me tell you I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all!</li>

    <li> Great colour. Opi is a very good product, the brush is excellent, and the quantity means you can use lots of times.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful color. I bought it for a friend for Christmas, but when it got to the house, I had to try it out myself. I ended up keeping it for myself and buying three more for more of my friends. It&#x27;s very dark, but you can tell it&#x27;s not black. I think it&#x27;s a very classy, wear-with-anything color.

    <li> Fabulous color. It&#x27;s my favorite color.</li>
    <li> Great fall color but make sure you use a base coat as this color stains your nails.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous polish and great formula. One of go-to polishes for the winter season. I usually apply with OPI Nail Envy Matte for a base coat, two coats of polish, and Seche Vite top coat. I clean pretty often and am pretty rough on my nails so my mark for a lasting polish is three days and Incognito Un Sausalito holds up very well in three day test.</li>
