<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for my use,  and a good value.</li>
    <li> Works excelent in my sauna</li>
    <li> Happy with my order.  As advertised.</li>
    <li> As is advertised...I use mine in various after-shaves, bathing products, and body powders for that cooling effect.  Whether hot or cold weather, these crystals do the trick!</li>
    <li> Highly recommended to my friend and every one is a good product .I use for to many think is good if you have a cold can you use menthol crystals.  also I add with my E liquid to give me good test menthol is a top quality , highly recommended ..good price for good quality.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with it</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, and we have been using it in our homemade products...aftershave, tiger balm, vapor rub.  It works...minty smelling, and very cooling.</li>
    <li> I just received mine yesterday and I could smell it  from inside the bubble envelope it arrived in.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because it arrived in a ziploc sandwich bag.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it weighted a little less than the amount specified&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that I love the smell because it&#x27;s so soothing. There are a list of things I plan to use this product.</li>
    <li> I use it to refresh the closets and this product works perfect: 1 teaspoon of crystals is enough for a big closet.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a flavoring for my electronic cigarettes. it is much more cost efficient to buy this in bulk here than it has been to by from the specialty suppliers.</li>
    <li> As expected, pure menthol crystals.</li>
    <li> I use this for my e-liquid. I&#x27;ve always been a menthol smoker. I tried different flavors but I always go back to menthol. I decided to make my own juice and this is the menthol crystals that I used. The aroma and smell of this is very strong(in a good way). This is packaged properly. Just make sure to keep it out of children&#x27;s reach. I love this stuff. I like my menthol extra strong. 4oz is already a lot if you&#x27;re just going to use this for your juices. This will last you a long time. Highly recommended for my fellow DIY vapers!</li>
    <li> I bought the menthol crystals for someone else.  The person loves the scent very much.</li>
    <li> My second thought was good lord that is a lot of crystals. My first thought was good lord that is a lot of crystal.</li>
    <li> Great product! Will be ordering more and would suggest this to others. Thank You!</li>
    <li> good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product, better then I ever expected - and it arrived quickly. I&#x27;m placing another order right now!</li>
    <li> EXTREMELY POTENT!! Use very little. I was using these for congestion in an inhailer and should have known better when the menthol took over the whole upstairs...but still I stuck my face in front of it and damn near burnt my nostrils away. Overall..they worked well!</li>
    <li> Great price, timely, free shipping. I am immensely satisfied.</li>
    <li> Perfect for vapors who want a great menthol experience!</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than scheduled and I must say...this smell AMAZING!! I haven&#x27;t used them in any products yet, but just the inside of the bag alone is fun to sniff...lol. I will be using these in therapeutic massage oils and foot soaks and possibly soar muscle balms! Completely satisfied and highly recommend this company!</li>
    <li> It did what I wanted .</li>
    <li> Crush and dissolve 50/50 crystals w/PGA for a perfect menthol vape! (Not straight up, obviously, but it&#x27;s the perfect concentrate for our mixes!)</li>
    <li> This is my second attempt to write a review for this excellent product and excellent seller! The shipping was free (included) and fast! I WILL buy from this seller again... hopefully he/she will have this available when I need it again.&lt;br /&gt;I dissolve it in Vodka, for use by drops over tobacco &amp; mixed in for deep, invigorating menthol feel/taste in my homemade cigarettes (@ 63 cents a pack ) I also use it in my e-cigs for menthol flavoring.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure there are other uses for the product as well.&lt;br /&gt;TYVM for being a great seller!</li>
    <li> The fragrance is great but I was surprised at how little there was in the bag when I received it.  I will be more cautious in the future.</li>
    <li> The order for 4oz of crystal menthol was expedited very fast. The product was priced good and quality was great. I will order more in the future as I use it for medicinal rubs.</li>
    <li> This stuff is FANTASTIC!! I will defiantly be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Must mix with PG.  It does not mix well with VG!&lt;br /&gt;Just crush the crystals, put about 2 parts of mint to 8 parts of PG.  If it does not mix, run some hot water over your closed bottle.</li>
    <li> Love them, will order more</li>
    <li> I used this menthol to add to the nicotine replacement solution for my wife&#x27;s e-cigarettes and it is high quality menthol that is easy to adjust to make her e- cigarette be closer to the Newports she used to smoke</li>
    <li> Good, will buy again when it&#x27;s cool.  They&#x27;ll melt during hot season during the shipping process.</li>
    <li> These crystals provide a kick-ass menthol scent in my aroma-therapy warmer. I can&#x27;t get over how pleasantly strong the aroma is. Excellent when I&#x27;m feeling a bit stuffy or otherwise sinus-y.</li>
    <li> They arrived the very next day. I made a peppermint foot butter and it was amazing. Thank you for this awesome product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these twice now. I&#x27;m using them as part of a Menthol Gel recipe for sore muscles. These Crystals are fantastic. Both of my orders arrived in great condition, no melting in shipping. I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out.</li>
    <li> these have worked well in my DIY pain relief bars also using YL essential oils.</li>
    <li> Perfect for melting down...I like working with this product while making pain rubs.  Keep your face a safe distance away, very strong-ventilation is a must if you are using the product in a small enclosed area.</li>
    <li> Really helped me with my nasal problems</li>
    <li> These crystals have so many great uses! Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> These menthol crystals are really high quality. The menthol crystals are very strong, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am dissolving them in Propylene Glycol for use as a menthol E-Liquid booster. This stuff is extremely potent and pure tasting! Very highly recommended for anyone wanting to DIY some E-Juice.</li>
    <li> I use it in the steam room at the gym.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Strong smelling and work great! Love these crystals and there are more than enough to last for quite some time. Will definitely order again when I need them.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great!! just pour a littler in every corner of the house, it&#x27;ll make a huge difference trust me...</li>
    <li> This company is generally prompt in their responses, so no complaints there. The product itself is excellent. I&#x27;ve been buying from their stock for at least a year, possibly for as long as 18 months (can&#x27;t recall offhand, sorry), and am satisfied enough to place at least one order every two months. I like the reliability of the quality as well.</li>
    <li> The service was fast and packaged well. The product is awesome and just what I wanted. Others I have tried had been sticky or basically weak. The menthol in these crystals are just perfect not to much but not weak. Will for sure purchase again.</li>
    <li> FAST shipping, amazing product. Second time I have ordered since I lost the first batch. Yup almost 1/4 pound of missing menthol SOMEWHERE in my kitchen. So I ordered a second batch and it is perfect. I have nice large crystals but  I do not care since I am melting them for body lotions right now. Would buy again and recommend to a friend but please understand the product and know a little goes a long way. I use one gram per 14 ounce bottle of lotion and that makes a pretty minty tingle.</li>
    <li> I used to buy a nasal saline spray that had menthol and eucalyptus in it, but it&#x27;s become impossible to find.  I got this to try making my own and it worked very well - was stronger than I expected so I will dilute it more.  The other reviews have given me more ideas for uses, too, and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  My cat loves the way it smells, too!</li>
    <li> We got these crystals when the latest bout of flu blew into town last month. Now I&#x27;m wondering why I haven&#x27;t done it sooner. They are potent, so use them wisely . The first few nights we burnt our noses a bit by using too much. Our method now is a 1/4 tsp in a potpourri warmer with a couple drops of tea tree and eucalyptus oil and some boiling water. Vapors in the room for hours. The menthol pops the head and chest open and the tea tree and eucalyptus soothe.&lt;br /&gt;I know we will always have these on hand for when we&#x27;re under the weather.</li>
    <li> These crystals are good quality and worked perfectly for the project I had at home. It was packaged nicely and shipped quickly. They were priced well also.</li>
    <li> This was a lot more than i expected for the price mix it with coconut oil as a tooth paste and to put in my oil burner and use it in e liquid be cautioned a little goes a very long way start with tiny amounts and work your way up it&#x27;s lasted like 2 months so far and I use it all the time</li>
    <li> I was so stopped up, I was getting panicked. Just the smallest amount in a little very hot water, sent vapors up into my sinus to clear and breath. Just close your eyes or the vapor will sting.</li>
    <li> 4oz is a ton of menthol crystals!  I use these for my ecig juice and are great.  Crush them up and fill a bottle 3/4 of the way, then fill the rest with PG and you are good to go with a strong menthol mix for your e-juices.</li>
    <li> Good product, definitely kicks up the menthol flavor in my tobacco.</li>
    <li> I use these for home-made air refreshers! My hubby loves the minty scent they give off. We don&#x27;t buy expensive dangerous air refreshers any more.</li>
    <li> lo uso para ponerselo a una crema para ponermelo en el cuerpo y me a caido muy bien ,me gusto</li>
    <li> I love these! In the past I have used peppermint oil, but menthol crystals are much stronger and effective.  They melt in hot water and put off strong menthol fumes, which really help relieve congestion.  I have also used them in the shower when I had a sore back.  I melted them in a cup and applied to menthol to my sore muscles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for it for so long and I don&#x27;t dread the allergy season any more. very, very good</li>
    <li> First time buyer who really liked the quality, packaging, and shipment of these menthol crystals. I made my own Ice N&#x27; Hot muscle rub and it works pretty good! I had tried essential oil the first time around but found the crystals are much more potent.</li>
    <li> Menthol crystals are hard to find. I make my own pressure point lotion as well as massage oils and lotions.  They do not work the same without this key ingredient (Menthol).  I ordered them from a pharmacy once and the price was 10 times the price of these.  They shipped quickly.  I&#x27;m very excited to find these on Amazon!  No more searching high and low. And such a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> minty. Dragons hate minty. I hate dragon breath. win win.</li>
    <li> Powerful and very potent.  A little goes a long way will order again, but I think the 4 oz will last several months.</li>
    <li> The main ingredient in some sinus formulas like Vicks Vapor Rub. A small amount of menthol crystals, put in water in a candle warmer like this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HLY2H2/ref&#x3D;ox_sc_act_title_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;ATVPDKIKX0DER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;near my bed keeps my sinus clear at night except against really bad sinus conditions that require sinus pills like sudafed.</li>
    <li> The product consists of well formed crystals, just as in the photo.  That is a very good indication of high purity.</li>
    <li> i use the menthol crystals to flavor my tobacoo and they work great. the bag i recieved was a little over the 4oz mark by .1/4 oz so i was more than happy. they are strong and make my tobaoo taste great. everyone who tries my RYO cigarettes loves them so much im constantly getting asked for some at work when the people asking already have there own newports because they like mine 10 times better. if you want to know how the solution is &amp;#34; 1/2 cup Pure grain alcohol , 1 tsp Glycerin USP , 2-3 Tbsp menthol crystals&amp;#34;  disolved in spray bottle to little mist the tobacoo let dry  and mix tobacoo at a 1 to 1 ratio 1 part mentholated to 1 part non-mentholated. using mint tobacoo is the best option. the grain alcohol can be expensive unless you go to ABC liquors and by there store brand which is 1/4 of name brand. the glycerin you can get at walmart for $2.50 by the bandaids.</li>
    <li> I bought these crystals to use in a pain relieving ointment, but I&#x27;m not sure how to get them from crystal for to a liquid form to add them.  They smell wonderful, so for now when my nose is stuffed up I just open the bag and breath in the fumes and it&#x27;s working really well for that.</li>
    <li> These crystals are powerful and aromatic.  Use them wisely and sparingly.  I will buy more if I run out but I don&#x27;t thing I will run out for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I use this to mentholate my own inhalations.  It seems pure and costs a lot less than premixed inhalations.</li>
    <li> As described, great product. Fast shipper. Would do business with again.</li>
    <li> Received in timely manor and as advertised.</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking this was a cheaper alternative to peppermint oil. It is not, but I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I initially wrap crystals in aluminum foil and slip it in the Vicks plugin vaporizer next to the bed. I can smell the menthol which helps me sleep better. Over night the crystals would completely vaporize. I then switched to the plug in candle tart warmer since it&#x27;s too much trouble putting the crystals into the vaporizer. I poured some water into the candle tart warmer and dropped in half a teaspoon of crystals. The crystals would not dilute in the water but pool together in the middle. The menthol smell was faint at first since the water keeps the temperature low, but became very strong as soon as all the water vaporized. Over all I&#x27;m very glad I got this product, I got much better and longer sleep when I use it. However I need to experiment with this for a few more days to find the right way to use it. I just mixed it with extra virgin Olive oil and it seems to produce a more consistent vapor. I just need to find the right temperature to heat the mixture with so it will last all night.</li>
    <li> These Menthol Crystals are very nice, what more is there to say.  They are what they are, and they work.</li>
    <li> I use these all the time for baths and cleaning.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really nice to add to other oils and stuff at the house that isnt cold enough. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> what I wanted, will last forever</li>
    <li> Arrived very quick, solid crystals, melt quickly into salves, very effective in powdered form, too. Very satisfied. Menthol is fun to work with!</li>
    <li> Very good qual for my ecig menthol use. Will order again in the. BUt at 4oz that may be 1/2 a year.</li>
    <li> These came quickly and well packaged. The crystals are in a sealed bag inside another bag and then in the box, yet I could smell the menthol before even opening the box. Awesome! These are apparently very potent and fresh and I can&#x27;t wait to use some. Clearly the bag I purchased will last me for many years just due to the strength. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Got the crystals because I was making my own vapor rub alternative and was able to successfully create that cooling/numbing feeling to open up my sinuses. Even adding the crystals to a carrier oil such as grape seed that is heated over a small oil heater work very well as well. Great product, highly recommend</li>
    <li> I thought these crystals were magical.  I would suggest that everyone be very cautious in using them - they are very strong.  I put the tip of a teaspoon in - approximately 1/4 tsp.  -  dropped the crystals into empty saucepan - boiled water and poured it  over the crystals -  draped a towel over my head and took a breath.  That was all it took.  DO BE VERY CAREFUL - THESE CRYSTALS ARE POTENT.</li>
    <li> Got the product pretty quick, very impressed. Read the other reviews about how much to use that did not help much because I was using this in a linament so I had to use more and use my best judgement. I will be ordering more because I plan to make more balm. I did not really feel the menthol tingly feeling too much in my balm but it definately clears the sinuses when I use it.  I gues that makes it great in that it is not too overpowering for those who want to use this product topically. If you are using this to clear your sinuses this is a great product.</li>
