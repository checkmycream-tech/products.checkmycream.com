<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> For my daughter. She loves it! Works great to cover her rosacia</li>
    <li> I hate makeup, and have never worn it or had good results with it.  But my rosacia has gotten to the point where I really needed something.  I now wear this every day.  I can apply it sparingly and feel like I am not wearing anything, and it really does tone the redness down.  Unless I over-apply, it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing makeup at all.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over a year. I have rosesa and this does help cover up my red cheeks. I do have to reapply in the evening sometimes as I don&#x27;t think this is a full coverage foundation. I also use Smashbox photo finish foundation primer color correcting with this foundation. They both seem to work very well together.</li>
    <li> This makeup really works to cover slight redness on my face.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products and this one out does them all. Simply put this product hides the redness with a very natural skin color finish.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many foundations to cover my rosacea induced redness that I have lost count! This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve found. In fact, just last night my friend told me how clear my skin looks!</li>
    <li> My face flushes under certain conditions; sensitivity to certain cleaners, weather extremes (heat or cold), wine, or frustration.  I have not had it diagnosed, but decided to try a new makeup.This makeup has worked to reduce the redness, and feels light and comfortable.  Most makeups I have used tend to be uncomfortable, and my face ends up looking flushed the longer I have the makeup on.  My husband is used to me saying shortly after I get home that I cannot wait to get this makeup off, because it is so uncomfortable.  This makeup has resolved the redness factor.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It is the perfect weight and provides all day coverage!  Beautiful!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different foundations, mineral, liquid etc, but this one is simply awesome. I love how smooth it is, what amazing coverage it provides as a base. I still need to use concealer for eyes and spots, but it&#x27;s a great base! It does have SPF in it though, so if you want to wear it at a wedding or party with lots of flashes, use a different type without SPF.</li>
    <li> packaging horrible.  No offer to remedy fact lid off, half gone...can&#x27;t give as gift like this....</li>
    <li> I have a red nose all the time!!! I didn&#x27;t want a red nose for my wedding so I decided to try this out. It works so good!!! I&#x27;d say it lasts all day but if you sweat a lot then it comes off. It saved the day</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, so I use this foundation to reduce redness.  Works good, not great.</li>
    <li> I have used several concealers and foundations to cover my roseaca, but they haven&#x27;t done the job as well and this product.</li>
    <li> this is good for people who suffer from rosacea it does not make it worse of flare up. it is a good make up and covers nicely.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product which is new on the market because it does the job!&lt;br /&gt;I have a very ruddy complexion and this make up cream covers it beautifully without being heavy.  The colour is appropriate for me too.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would recommend it to anyone who has similar colour skin.</li>
    <li> great for sensitive fair roscea prone skin</li>
    <li> Great product covers very well. I absolutely love it it lasts a good long time too. But it&#x27;s kind of expensive, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for awhile now and it is the best solution to even out skin tone redness. I have roseaca and have looked for years for something that works. I am very happy with this product. Looks natural, feels natural and has staying power. Worth every penny. Thanks clinique you won me over.</li>
    <li> Best foundation made for me. Lasts a long time. Smooth application and it covers but seems to disappear.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the Clinique counter at Macy&#x27;s.  It seemed to work great for 3 days.  Covered the redness very well but on the 4th day I broke out in a rash which turned really dry and itchy.  Had to use cortisone cream to heal.  So if you have really sensitive skin I wouldn&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I have very reactive skin, and this stuff really soothes it and gives it a dewy radiant look.</li>
    <li> I wish I had discovered this long ago, it works better than any concealer does and is not greasy or oily. It just covers up any redness. One time and you&#x27;re good to go..</li>
