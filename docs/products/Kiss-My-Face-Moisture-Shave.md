<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the consistency of it and a little goes a long way, but I ended up with serious razor burn and irritation. I don&#x27;t have that problem when I just use soap. I was hoping with would protect my legs during shaving and help make them smoother after, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. My skin didn&#x27;t feel any more moisturized and the razor burn was a serious issue.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product and wanted to like it. It just didn&#x27;t work for me. I felt like I had more razor burn and nicks while using this product. Plus, you need a good amount to work up a lather suitable for shaving.</li>
    <li> I see why people love this stuff. Though ill probably end up getting a different scent even though i do enjoy the scent from this one. This just happened to be cheaper than the others at time of purchase and thats all i cared about (Maybe Mint or Key Lime or Scentless). I WISH THE BAMBOO+TEA TREE wasnt so expensive :/! I really would love to try that one.</li>
    <li> I had been a faithful Skintimate user for many years until I recently began having more and more problems with razor burn.  Also, I hate how the metal container rusts and gets moldy in the shower over time.  Yuck.  I really wanted another shave gel that was more gentle, and bought this one based of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few shaves, I love it and doubt I will use anything else for a long time!  I have sensitive skin, and this coats my legs nicely, creating a creamy barrier between the razor and my skin.  So far, I&#x27;ve had no razor burn, and my legs feel soft and almost moisturized when I leave the shower.  The smell is great, and isn&#x27;t too strong.  Also, I think this container will last a long time because a little seems to go a long way.  Great product!  Glad I stumbled across it!</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face. Products are always a good buy no matter which product you get from them and this is no exception.I have been using their products for years and have never been disapointed.I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for this shave cream.  It smells good, but leaves a &#x27;skiddy&#x27; film, like bar soap, which results in a less than ideal shave - not for me.  Having used liquid soap for years to alleviate soap film from my sinks &amp; tubs, I&#x27;m not interested in adding a product that leaves a film, like bar soap!  I&#x27;ll stick to using my hair conditioner for shaving - it works better, leaves my skin much smoother, and there&#x27;s no soap film/scum to clean up.</li>
    <li> This is getting two stars because when it arrived from Amazon the pump&#x27;s top was cracked and one side is broken off and sharp.  It hurts the fingers, but the product is still usable, albeit​ unpleasantly.  I only just got it, so I am commenting on that alone.</li>
    <li> Our family is very conscious about purchasing all natural products. After lathering up and shaving with no irritation or nicks, – Kiss my Face – is my new 4 in 1 shaving cream. No additional moisturizer needed!</li>
    <li> Works really with shaving, very happy!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Makes your legs super-slick but it&#x27;s also remarkably easy to rinse off.</li>
    <li> Kiss My Face is one of my favorite brands. I bought this to replace my mint scented version that ran out. So far, it&#x27;s working great and has a very refreshing, energizing scent.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, however, I only gave it four stars since this is not the scent of my choice. I used to always get olive oil and aloe scent and I haven&#x27;t been able to find that one lately. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the lavender.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the product is a very good product and I much prefer the lotion than the standard shaving creams. The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shaving lotion.  A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever. It also has a very nice slip.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells amazing and feels great. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Lathers very well with a brush.  Not as good without one.</li>
    <li> I have been using Remington&#x27;s Shave Gel and the King of Shave&#x27;s equivalent for many years now.  Recently I decides to try something new so I bought some KMF and also the Cremo Shave Cream.  My personal experience is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KMF &#x3D; Good&lt;br /&gt;Remington/KoS &#x3D; Better&lt;br /&gt;Cremo &#x3D; Best&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that all of these provide a quality shave.  It is just that KMF is the most diluted of the three and does not create the same level of slickness as the others.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this product because I had a baby recently and getting to the store to buy my usual tin can shaving cream was not happening. I have prime so I shopped for a ladies shaving cream that would qualify for 2 day shipping. I took a chance on this product for that reason and also because of its wonderful reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed! This made shaving so much nicer. The consistency is like a conditioner that lathers. It goes on smooth and does not slide off unless put directly under water. The pump is so convenient compared to a can you have to pick up to spray the contents out of. Shaving feels nice and everything feels very smooth afterwords. And a bonus is a nice fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this product out performs the run of the mill tin can shaving cream. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this regularly now.</li>
    <li> Works well but I can&#x27;t say it totally eliminated razor burn.  I do have very sensitive skin.  Great price.</li>
    <li> Why did I ever use aerosol shaving cream again!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Kiss my Face brand chapstick and came across their shaving lotion via an Amazon recommendation. This stuff doesn&#x27;t have the chemicals that my old \\&quot;cream in a can\\&quot; did, and it gives me a close shave and leaves my skin soft! (Unlike other natural products, which I find sometimes aren&#x27;t as effective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months of use I haven&#x27;t noticed any rashes or irritation (even in sensitive areas) and the bottle lasts forever (way longer than my old aerosol shaving cream). It&#x27;s also easier to distribute - the pump is effortless - and doesn&#x27;t rust. And it&#x27;s cheap! Wishing I came across this years ago.</li>
    <li> This shaving lotion is the best.  I use to get razor burn when I shaved my underarms but when I started to use this it fixed that problem.  I thought you&#x27;d need a lot but a little goes a long way, you just need to let it lather.  The pomegranate smell is great too.  I definitely would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite flavor of this fantastic cream but the price was great, so I&#x27;m adjusting.  Generally love the cream and really like the other flavors I&#x27;ve tried. Great value in any size.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;While I may have used slightly better creams, they were all $40+ products.&lt;br /&gt;For the price you pay, They are on par with high end, luxury creams.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, This product only falls short of the expensive creams with their scent, and don&#x27;t get me wrong. They don&#x27;t smell bad. they&#x27;re just kind of fruity, or less sophisticated than some other high end creams.&lt;br /&gt;But, when it comes to quality of shave, (where it really matters). Top notch!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. Goes on smooth. Leaves my skin silky. Smells just amazing.</li>
    <li> Gives my legs the closest, smoothest shave ever, even with my 4 year old disposable razor. Awesome smell too. Legs are smooth as silk.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! And same great shave as with unscented.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not sensitive for my facial skin. feel smooth after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;would buy it again</li>
    <li> There is no comparison between KMF shaving lotion and anything else.  The first time I used it - I thought - well....... fecal matter!!!  Nothing!  That was it?  It is so emollient that the blade glided...... I did not realize the blade had shaved my skin...... will never ever go back to &#x27;traditional&#x27; shaving cream. Lasts a long time because it does not take much..... &#x27;a little dab will do ya&#x27; ......</li>
    <li> I love the way this smells, but it made me a little itchy.  I didn&#x27;t think it was that much more moisturizing than my usual stuff.  It made the bathtub slippery and unsafe for my toddler.  It also wasn&#x27;t good for shaving under arms.  Gave me red bumps. I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for a more natural alternative to my usual Gillette or Barbasol.</li>
    <li> I have tried all variety of shaving products and this is by far the best. The pomegranate grapefruit smell is fantastic and it provides a really smooth shave. One pump is enough for a whole face and body-if you keep spreading it around it will just keep lathering up more and more.It&#x27;s also good because it doesn&#x27;t have parabens or sulfates in it.  It works better than traditional shaving cream and leaves skin feeling clean, soft, and moisturized. Highly recommended.This product is terrific!</li>
    <li> Definitely gets the job done, but after you rinse it off, you skin feels... I don&#x27;t really even know how to explain it, maybe rubbery? Kind of like after using a bad quality soap with no moisturizer and your wet skin is uncomfortable while in the shower.... smells great though xD</li>
    <li> The scent is mild and pleasant. Lathers well. Tried lots of other products and this is my favorite. Unfortunately, can&#x27;t find it in tubes for travel.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly the pomegranate aroma is quite pleasant.  I normally don&#x27;t like fruity shampoos, etc., but this one is OK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving cream itself is excellent -- my favorite for years.</li>
    <li> The best shave I have ever had!!!!</li>
    <li> I got the pomegranate grapefruit and it smells great!  This is the only shaving lotion that does not give me razor burn.</li>
    <li> I was not expecting to like this, but it seemed like an interesting product so I gave it a try. I have come to find that after a month of use I absolutely adore this product. I will only use this from now on -  that is how much I love this product. It is a great consistency and I feel as if I use very little compared to a can of gel. In addition, it spreads evenly, is fairly thick yet slips over your skin thinly, and leaves your skin silky, smooth, and moisturized, yet not too moist. I have used this on numerous parts of my body and have found that it is just as pleasant everywhere, and leaves absolutely no residue or acne producing oils behind. This bottle will last me quite a long time and I could not be happier with this product. So glad that I stumbled upon it.</li>
    <li> Smells so good and does a great job without harsh ingredients.</li>
    <li> This product brings me back when I am using it, the scent is so nice if I close my eyes I think of sunshine &amp; fruit &amp; warm weather as well as being at the beach. I love this! This is the 3rd time I have used this and I will continue to from now on. What a pleasant experience during a shave ( something which is not fun to do) . This product really takes away the negatives from this experience and makes it a well deserved positive! Not only smells great, but the moisturizers in this make my skin so nice &amp; soft during and after use. I needed my skin to be soft, the winter cold makes it real rough &amp; dry. Now after this product I do not have to worry about that or the winter itch. Totally gone! what a great reward this product is. Not greasy or uncomfortable during use at all. The result is wonderful! Thank you so very very much!</li>
    <li> I have used this brand for a long time and it&#x27;s my favorite shave cream, but I was skeptical about whether or not I&#x27;d like this scent. I&#x27;m happy to report I love it and it is my new favorite!</li>
    <li> Great scent, works great for my dry legs!</li>
    <li> works really well  leaves my skin moist not dry or irritated&lt;br /&gt;scent is mild and makes it very easy to get a great shave</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing for all of your shaving needs!</li>
    <li> Works as well as any other shave cream/gel, and is cruelty-free. I love it!</li>
    <li> I suffered from razor burn for years.  Kiss My Face Shave Lotion solved this problem for me!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream. It is super moisturizing and lasts longer than a can of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Have used kiss my face shaving lotions for years!!! Love them so much! I have extremely sensitive skin and its the only thing that works for me! Love it!</li>
    <li> Only stuff my wife will use on her legs. Non drying and easy to use in the shower</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. I used it this morning and this evening, my skin still feels soft and smooth. It is creamy, without being greasy. So I felt no irritation even after shaving. Oh, and it has a yummy fragrance. Definitely a plus.</li>
    <li> Works well and is not full of chemicals.  Shaving my legs is not one of my favorite things, but this makes it easier and smells good as well.</li>
    <li> Very lubricating without being greasy.  Since it is a liquid, it is perfect for travel.  I pour some into a 3oz container and can take in my carry on luggage.</li>
    <li> Only thing I&#x27;ll use to shave</li>
    <li> Smooth and moisturizing and helps cut down on dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li> I recently returned to the wet shaving method and have tried a couple of shaving soaps. This has, by far, the most lubricating properties of any I&#x27;ve tried. So slick that the razor feels like it has no blade in it.  can now shave three passes with less irritation than I got from one pass with other soaps. Lathers great in a scuttle.</li>
    <li> Seems like a decent product however the pump does not work so I have to unscrew the bottle every time which is annoying.  I am sure I just got a bum bottle but still...</li>
    <li> Cruelty free and leaves your skin so soft!</li>
    <li> I was using Cremo Creme for shaving, but I wished it had a pump. The tube packaging was really inconvenient. The pump on this is great. One pump does a full leg. The consistency is thinner, but I think that actually helps me use one pump over the entire leg. Cremo Creme was so thick I think I wasted too much trying to hydrate it to spread it and then losing some to trying to close/set the package aside so that I could begin shaving. The smell of this Kiss My Face is great too. Just smells like a grapefruit body wash or something. Cremo was a bit weird. The regular smelled like orange Kool-Aid powder before you mix it up -- a little acidic and orangey. The lady version strongly smelled like pi&amp;ntilde;a colada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t ever used a shaving cream before, you should try. I used gel for a long time, then foam. Creams let you see what you are doing and as long as you keep it hydrated, you can sorta reuse it as you go along for those second passes for patches you miss.</li>
    <li> I think product great. I used it the first time, it smelled wonderful and fruitful, as you smell grapefruit smell immediately, takes you away. The feeling is smooth and creamy, but just love it for your skin, with its shaving benefits of fast and smooth shaving, which looks beat other products of not so much needed as shaving creme, being much on your face but with this just such needed, but  much get the shaving needs every time you shave. Recommend friend, just what the shaver needs on anytime day needed.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather, like at all. Don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Super moisturizing and smells wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Best shaving cream I have found!</li>
    <li> Very economical and responds very well to a badger brush and cup. Great lather whipped up in short order. A best buy.</li>
    <li> My favorite of the kiss my face line so far.  There&#x27;s no better shave than a slow, dry shave in the shower using hot water, then leaving the shower and a reshave with kiss your face.  The the added benefit... you smell like a fucxin orange!!! ...  by the way the way my girlfriend seems to love this kiss flavor.... she just seems to hang around my face after I shave this particular cream like a bee around flora.  Its because of this that i&#x27;m thinking of shaving my nether regions with this stuff...woo hoo!.. this is America baby!</li>
    <li> Not sure how much I can say about a shaving lotion, but it works great, and smells even better.  Love KMF products.</li>
    <li> Wow, this shaving lotion is so smooth!  I was skeptical that it could work as well as the more familiar metal cans of gel/foam.  Much to my pleasant surprise, this is superior!  The plastic pump is much more convenient in the shower and certainly won&#x27;t leave rings of rust.  The smell is a nice summery, tropical scent, not overpowering or fake.  I haven&#x27;t cut or nicked myself once since I started using this and my normally dry legs are super soft when I get out of the shower.  I&#x27;ll never go back to those metal cans again!</li>
    <li> I got this product because it&#x27;s an all natural shaving cream, I really love it and have no complaints! The smell is great and it makes my legs feel nice and soft!</li>
    <li> Only thing that works on not drying out face.</li>
    <li> To me this stuff is way better than a lot of the foo foo options for 5x the price.  Love this compared to foam and gels. Haven&#x27;t been disappointed with any of their products. Just wish I could find them locally.</li>
    <li> very smooth shaving experience! no itch feeling unlike other brands. will definitely purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month now so that I could give a fair review. Overall I think the product is ok but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because I&#x27;m not a fan of fruity fragrances on my face. The lotion tends to be a little runny on my face, so once I apply it I have to shave immediately in order for it not to spill on the counter or into the sink. I thought my shave would be a lot smoother but I still felt a slight drag on my face. One thing I do like about it is how easy it rinses off my face and blade when I&#x27;m done shaving. One more thing, try not to let this stuff get in your mouth. It tastes awful.</li>
    <li> The best shaves I&#x27;ve had since I started shaving over half a century ago!</li>
    <li> Love this shaving lotion!  I recently started using a safety razor and needed a shaving cream.  But creams are expensive and I&#x27;m cheap.  This shaving lotion is perfect.  It gets a nice lather and its very slick for a great close shave.  I am a loyal customer now!!</li>
    <li> So much better than shaving cream. Gives the best, closest shave. Leaves your skin silky soft with no residue feeling, and great on the bikini line! Smells amazing too. I would definitely recommend this to others and I will for sure be buying again.</li>
    <li> I really only use this product for shaving, as I saw a recommendation from another reviewer.  So I just keep the bottle in my shower and use it with my wet/dry shaver.  Works great.  My skin is a but sensitive.  Since I have used this, and shaved, have never had any cuts, dryness, or any issues that could be associated with shaving.  Will use this from now on.</li>
    <li> Nice shaving lotion with good smell, however the smell is not very strong. I use it with my Panasonic electric shaver ES-LA63 (wet-dry) and this combination provides a clean and smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works great and lasts forever. I&#x27;ve never had a cut or razor burn. Much better value than the aerosol can-type varieties. It has a pleasant, fresh smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Very creamy with a pleasant and not overwhelming fragrance. Does a nice job preventing razorburn. Will keep buying this item.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Does it&#x27;s job.  Nice minty feel and odor.  Though I prefer Proraso, I don&#x27;t mind using KMF too!</li>
    <li> very good, moisturizing. it has that &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; type of consistency, but it does what is suppose to + it&#x27;s more of a natural brand, so i do recommend it. besides, it lasts longer than any other conventional shaving gel/lotion.</li>
    <li> Velvety like lotion and leaves my skin feeling soft. Smells nice too- love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I wanted a natural product without additives that could be harmful.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it- my skin feels soft, the scent is great, and the amount I use is easily controllable because it isn&#x27;t in an aerosol can.  I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> The best shave for my face and for my wife and daughters legs. Repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. It smells wonderful, and I think it really does help moisturize while shaving. it arrived as expected.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something that was a bit more natural and ran into this product. It doesn&#x27;t cause any ingrown hairs (which are an unfortunate issue with me) smells great! The texture is a little weird and not what I&#x27;m used to...more soapy. However, this isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  The fragrances are nice, not too potent, or you can choose fragrance free. It is really concentrated, so a little goes a long way.  I personally dilute it with a little water and heat it up for a clean, close shave.  One bottle usually lasts me about 6 months, so it becomes a great value.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the lavender one.</li>
    <li> Love product and smell, sure you will too. The feeling product not bad,smell just like Pomegranate. Want clean shave, with creme then use this product, yes do let shaving other cremes too the side, try this new product out now. I expect keep this product main one in my shaving creme department.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Creates a very smooth &amp; clean shave &amp; smells good. And no rust can stain on my bathtub!</li>
    <li> Came quickly and at a great price!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re used to shaving with foams or gels, this will be a completely different experience.  This lets your razor get right next to your skin without burning it and provides just enough lubrication to let your razor slide without nicking.  It works great on my legs, but my husband is a fan of it for his face too!</li>
    <li> Unconventional type of shaving cream - relies on lathering by you and is sorta like soap but thicker.  I really like it as it&#x27;s impossible to waste this product - you know when you have put enough on.  It creates a barrier between your bare legs and the razor and prevents cuts, nicks, and such.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this economical shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than regular shaving cream and works so much better!</li>
    <li> The product arrive com time and looked fine. However, it did not seem right. I have been buying Kiss My Face Shaving Lotions for many, many years and loved them in past. This seemed like it was part soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just didn&#x27;t shave as smooth as what I&#x27;ve bought at natural food stores. I could be wrong, but I will buy it at a store next time to compare and update my review.</li>
    <li> This is similar to Dr Carver&#x27;s Shave Butter (from Dollar Shave Club), though not as thick. I do like the thickness of Dr Carver&#x27;s when applying a bit better, however, the end result is the same: a shave that&#x27;s extremely smooth and soft skin. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a good alternative to the expensive shave lotion.  It smells great and I get a close shave.  However, I end up with razor bumps and ingrown hairs after using it.  For me, the product is inferior compared to Jack Black shave cream, which seems to prevent the razor bumps and ingrown hairs at least for me.</li>
    <li> I love this! It&#x27;s the ultimate, best ever shaving cream.</li>
    <li> This is a great price for this product. It lathers, moisturizes, and rinses nicely,and smells great. I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I originally purchased this for my wife, and after having it around, I have found myself using it as well. What caused me to initially purchase this item was that this product is a shaving lotion, rather than a creme. With my wife shaving frequently in areas that girls do, it seemed like a no-brainer to get something that would hopefully add moisture while also providing protection from razor burn. If you haven&#x27;t used this product before, let me first mention that the consistency is not identical to moisturizing lotion for your body, face, hands, etc; when dispensing, it comes out somewhat like lotion, but much lighter, and a little bit sudsy. So again, those that have not used this product, do not be concerned that this is going to be too heavy or greasy, I use this on my face and I would say that I have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will first list the reasons why this product is better than your standard shaving cream:&lt;br /&gt;1) Consistency: because this is &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;, it is a bit thicker, which causes the substance to stay on your skin and not wash away as easily, especially when shaving in the shower. My wife applies this to her whole leg while in the shower and the product stays in contact with her skin (obviously direct water will rinse off).&lt;br /&gt;2) Protection: the product is more like lotion than a cream, it really feels as though the product provides a better barrier between your skin and the razor.&lt;br /&gt;3) Moisture: Again, I have started using this product on my face as I shave, and I would probably fit into the &amp;#34;oily skin&amp;#34; category, and I do not, in any way feel as though this adds moisture like lotion. Instead, it moisture is more like balancing out the drying effects of the water and the dragging of the razor. In general, after I use this product, my face feels more refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a guy with sensitive skin, I have moved away from shaving cream in a can, and have purchased finer products from places like The Art of Shaving; I love and recommend shaving cream, but after using Kiss My Face, I will use this forever because I really believe that it creates a strong, consistent barrier between my skin and razor blade.commend shaving cream, but after using Kiss My Face, I will use this forever because I really believe that it creates a strong, consistent barrier between my skin and razor blade.</li>
    <li> Great and smells good</li>
    <li> Works great and lasts a while.</li>
    <li> I thought I would give this a try but not happy with it.  I know it&#x27;s lotion but I felt it was a little to watery.&lt;br /&gt;Works fine but I think I prefer using my Edge shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Or I&#x27;ll give Nivea or Neutrogena a try.</li>
    <li> Great product.  How did I live without it?  I am hooked.  It truly is a moisturizer and lathers like a soap.  On the other hand, it feels like a cream after shaving.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  You can use it alone, but I like applying Arko stick to my face first.  The combination is great and both products are very reasonably priced.  I have tried several of the scents.  I really do like the grapefruit.  I thought that it might not be very manly, but I actually do like the smell--it&#x27;s not overpowering at all, and it doesn&#x27;t last very long--just while you are shaving.  If this one isn&#x27;t for you, they have many other scents--all great products.</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;No more aluminum can rings in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than tegular shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a really long to me.&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Forget the chemical laden spray cans, this stuff is great. Yeah, I know Colgate bought them out, but as long as the natural ingredients remain unchanged this is still the way to go.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent by Kiss My Face.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this product since my skin is very sensitive and I have a hard time finding a shaving cream that does not irritate my skin.  I initially bought this at Giant Eagle and it was almost double the price on Amazon.  The product truly feels like a lotion and is a little bit thicker than most other shaving creams and lotions by other brands.  The best part of this shaving lotion is that it does not irritate my skin at all.  I still seem to get some ingrown hairs but that is only when I am in a rush and not paying attention to what I am doing.  The smell is very pleasant and I love anything pomegranate.  The fact that this is Eco friendly and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin is wonderful.  Sometimes I feel that it is a little too thick but you just have to pay attention to how much you dispense from the bottle and use a thin layer on your skin</li>
    <li> Great product! I love the sent. Keeps legs smooth and hydrated.</li>
    <li> I love this shaving lotion-it is free of the undesired chemicals. It does a great job providing a smooth shave. I will definately buy it again and again. This one smells great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural shaving creams on my skin, with so-so results. This brand by far exceeded my expectations! The smell is great, I don&#x27;t have to use a ton, and it isn&#x27;t sticky or leaving residue in the blades of the razor.</li>
    <li> I love, love,love this product!!!!!! It does not dry out my skin, smooths on nicely and you just need a little bit. The scent is an added bonus; I love the way it smells! My son uses the mint scented one for his face and loves it as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the various fragrances of this product for 15 years or more. I love it - it is one of only a small handful of beauty/care products that I never tire of or stray from. Does what is is supposed to do, a bottles lasts me several months, great for sensitive skin - just the best!! I hope they never stop making it!</li>
    <li> I read so many reviews and I love foam shaving creams. The wonderful thing about them is the way you feel upon rinse and how they hold up on each swipe of the razor. I swear by KMF, but this product is something I won&#x27;t purchase again. If you love your legs feeling soft and the silky rinse during your shave... you won&#x27;t get that here. Once water hits the surface it rinses to the point of razor skippage. (I can practically hear squeaks with each stroke) So I tried it in the tub. Same effect. As soon as I dipped my razor in for more water and it ran down my leg I might have well been shaving with vinegar or alcohol. No foaming foundation whatsoever. This left me with more razorburn bumps than anything. Great fragfrance.. terrible product for women who love the additional moisture that comes from a good shaving product. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Over the past year or so, I have been gradually starting to switch all of my products to more organic products (phthalate/paraben free, etc.) and finding a good shaving cream that fits that description has actually been one of the hardest things for me! My search ended when I tried the Kiss My Face Moisturizing Shaving Lotion! This smells good. A slight grapefruit scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering. The consistency of this is kind of similar to shampoo (a creamy shampoo I guess if that makes sense.) It glides on your skin nicely, feels great, and really allows you to get all of the hair. The last shaving cream I tried (from Alba) smelled great, but was so thick it clogged up my razor, and I went through razor blades like crazy because they just would collect this gross gunk that was hard to get out. I had no problem whatsoever with this one. I love the pump also!!!!!!! So convenient! Nice sleek packaging. I will definitely be re-purchasing this and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> All natural and smells great</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving lotion I have tried, and I went through all the highest rated shaving creams on amazon to try to find the best just for fun.</li>
    <li> I have been using Kiss My Face products forever. The shaving lotion is the best, no nicks or skinned areas on my legs. All of the scents are nice but the Pomegranate Greatfruit is especially interesting.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works way better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used, including all the big-name brands, and it&#x27;s far less toxic according to environmental working group&#x27;s skin deep database.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff ~ it serves its purpose well. My boyfriend uses it to shave his face, and I, my taint. We love it!</li>
    <li> Bought to use for a man&#x27;s face and a woman&#x27;s legs and underarms and it works great for all. Helps prevent razor burn and sensitivity and gets a closer shave.</li>
    <li> smells great, good lather. For the price, this is a great buy. One bottle lasts me almost 3 months. But then again I am not a hairy person &#x3D;P</li>
    <li> Works very well! I love the scent of it! It smells so juicy and fruity. This is a good quality moisture shave, and it&#x27;s also natural which is great. I love the way it makes my skin feel. It definitely not a gel or a cream, I&#x27;m asuming it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s natural, but it reminds me more of soap. I typically like to use gels/creams because it&#x27;s so thick and prevents any cuts or nicks, but this does a great job of preventing that as well.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, and the bottle seems to last a lot longer than a typical can of shaving cream.</li>
    <li> Well all I can say is I have a shave den full of shave cream, gel and soaps and this is by far the best of them all. Some friends laughed at this when I first showed them but now its a must have.</li>
    <li> This shave moisturizers very well and leaves my face baby soft!  The squeeze tubes are better than the pumps at dispensing.  I had to add a bit of water to make it dispense better.</li>
    <li> The hands-down best option for shower shavers: no brush required, no cap to drop, no waste of an overpriced shaving puck. At the basin, even, it provides great skin conditioning, and somehow a closer shave, allowing full blade contact with its unique glide. But getting the quantity right can be tricky for brush users. The lather doesn&#x27;t look shiny enough, by soap standards, and if you overcompensate with more soap, and it will clog the razor, causing cuts. I&#x27;ve decided that one squirt in the brush is right for face lathering. For a more intuitive, traditional application, give it to your wife, and just steal enough to soup up your Van Der Hagen. http://amzn.com/lm/R3Q4Z8M61R614L</li>
    <li> Would give 5 stars but frequently the pump on new bottles fails to work properly.  I&#x27;d say 1 in 4.  Im in the habit of keeping the pump from the old bottle until I verify that the pump on the new bolltle works.  The product itself is flawless.  I&#x27;ve used ot for about 6 years now.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  It foams up thick.  It makes shaving easy. I&#x27;m sensitive to perfumes and smells and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother me at all.  It lubricates and almost provides a barrier to prevent cutting your skin.  When the bottle gets low, I have to add water to use up the rest of the bottle.  I recently ran out and need to reorder.  I looked at my local store for it that carried this brand but it wasn&#x27;t there.  Amazon is probably cheaper anyway at this price point.  I try and stay away from mainstream, items because of the crappy toxic chemicals they use.  I&#x27;ve used the mint one too and like it also.</li>
    <li> Liked it but not impressed. Almost had a soapy shampoo consistency. Smelled nice.</li>
    <li> ::::: BEST FOR MEN:::::  This is simply the BEST shaving product available, bar none. Very close shave with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Wash face&lt;br /&gt;Apply product&lt;br /&gt;Shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottle lasts me almost a year. Try Dorco Pace razors too. Inexpensive and as sharp as name brand razors.</li>
    <li> Good grapefruit scent, better still shaving smoothness.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s mostly very natural and it smells really yummy. You do have to work to get it to lather, but one full pump will shave one leg. A little goes a very long way! I still have way more than half a bottle and I&#x27;ve had it for well over a month (maybe two) and I shave almost everyday. It&#x27;s great. Buy it.</li>
    <li> This not only gives a smooth moisturized shave, but smells great and doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze, which is really saying a lot considering most smells make me sneeze!</li>
    <li> This is not a lotion I bought it because it is called shaving lotion. If you are looking for shaving lotion get a different product I use Beard Lube and it is WICKED expensive so I wanted to try this well you get what you pay for. This is a shaving slime your best bet is to whip it up with a brush in to a foam, it will whip up and this way it is not horrible but not a lotion.</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic! My husband uses this every time he shaves and loves it. Less nicks and less irritated skin. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff was really great. I added way too much water for the first leg and was disappointed it didn&#x27;t lather like creams do, instead it was very runny. On the second leg, I added less water and it lathered perfectly. My legs are so smooth, not even irritated slightly, they are soft, and not dry like other shaving products leave my legs. This stuff smells almost exactly like orange Tic Tacs. I love it and am not disappointed at all with the product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell...no harsh chemicals.  Does the job well and good ingredients. Would purchase this again!</li>
    <li> great cruelty free product. this company never disappoints. leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> Leaves you with silky smooth skin. The lotion lets you get a super close shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that smoothed and moisturized my legs when shaving.  This fits the bill and it smells great too.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Slimey, is the best word I can come up with. Sure, it lubes for a shave, but it&#x27;s drippy and slimey. I wouldn&#x27;t dare try to use this with a shirt on, or without planning to take a shower right after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the smell..... gross. Some may like it, to me it smells like an unnatural byproduct of some sort of air-freshener factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said..... if we judge it by whether it helps with a smooth shave, then I&#x27;d still give it a good score in that department. But no better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  It&#x27;s hard to come by locally.  I apply it by putting a single pump on a hot, wet shaving brush.  Much better and cheaper than a can.  One container lasts about 6 months when shaving every day.</li>
    <li> I love this product more than any other shaving lotion I have tried.  Thanks</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving lotion. It&#x27;s very creamy and a little goes a long way. It also smells great.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome shave lotion.  I tried it at my daughter&#x27;s and immediately loved it so I ordered two bottles!  I will definitely keep using this product.  It smells good, feels good on my skin and moisturizes very well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and lathers well. This is the only brand of shaving product that I buy.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works way better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used, including all the big-name brands, and it&#x27;s far less toxic according to environmental working group&#x27;s skin deep database, i would recommend this product,to anyone looking for a great product,i like to let anyone who is looking for a great product,would love this product,i am not really the type of person,that give my review,of a product unless i love it i highly recommend it</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Easy on your skin with no razor burn. Highly reccommended .Lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I thought it was thin at first, being used to shaving cream, but you rub it in and it gets thicker. I wanted something natural to replace what I usually use and it turns out, this was a pretty economical choice. A little goes a long way! Leaves my legs soft with no razor burn or cuts and it smells really good.</li>
