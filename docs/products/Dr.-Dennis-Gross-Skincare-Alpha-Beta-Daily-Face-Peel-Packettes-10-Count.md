<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only skin peel product I can use on my face without causing horrible dryness or acne afterwords. I have sensitive skin so I only use these every 3-4 weeks and I&#x27;m happy with the results. My face feels cleaner and skin is firmer. Great product for sensitive skin or AB hydroxy newbies.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before years ago, so when I started getting breakouts again, I thought of using this product. I dont know if the formula has changed with the new name (used to be MD Skincare) but it isnt as effective as before. Its okay, but nothing compared to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; product Im used to using. Helps with breakouts a little, and does leave this skin smoother and glowing</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I am almost 40 and I&#x27;ve been battling acne since I was a teenager. I use this to help keep my pores happy and my the few fine lines I have improved after using this. I don&#x27;t use it every day, I use it once or twice a week. My skin is very sensitive and I try not to over treat it.</li>
    <li> These pads worked really good and I was very happy with how they made my skin feel. The reason why I took a point off is because of the price. Though good, but I wish they were cheaper, and they did cause me to turn red for a little bit but it left after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> This is a skin product that gives instant gratification in that the pores are emptied of small blackheads and any peeling debris and there is immediate smoothing.  I believe that the product works long term also by helping with dark spots.  My skin on my neck feels burnt and gets raw if I use the Daily Peel there but that is OK, my face is what I bought it for.  I use Retin-A and my skin is too sensitive to use the \\&quot;Daily\\&quot; peel more than once or twice a week but that is all I need.  Not using this daily, I prefer the packettes because the jar lasts so long that the last few would dry out.  Sunscreen is good for everyone but mandatory if you use products like this.  I am 60 and still have oily skin!  I wish products like this were around when I was younger and was troubled by constant breakouts.  There are so many skin products out there one just gets confused as to what to try so I hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> I tried these through a Sephora sample and loved them.  They are easy to use and leave my face feeling soft and smooth. Price was better than Sephora as well.</li>
    <li> Use this once or twice a week. Does a great job of sweeping away tiny flakes, making serum or lotion &amp;#34;sink in&amp;#34; better that night and makeup go on more smoothly the next day. My skin is sensitive and on the dry side, and these don&#x27;t irritate. If you want more intensity, go for the extra-strength!</li>
    <li> Have used this religious for a year - use the pads 1-2 times a week, very simple, definitely see a difference in pores, cleanness, and shine. I have very sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
    <li> This works well and makes me feel like I&amp;#34;m really cleaning my face. The 2 step process is super easy. Doesn&#x27;t seem like it does much but after repeated use, I can see the difference in my skin. My face seems brighter, not dull looking skin. I use it about 2x/week.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC at home facial peel! I first tried it via my VIB sample through Sephora. The peel leaves your skin looking and feeling amazing! Barely any sting, if any sting at all! Perfect for beginners!!!</li>
    <li> I was so excited after reading all the reviews and even seeing good reviews on YouTube. They haven&#x27;t done anything for my skin at all. Save your money and try another product!</li>
    <li> Saw this advertised on TV. Thought I would give it a try.  I have had professional peals with good results.  This product did not come close to expectations. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are mild enough to use every day and they do a good job of refreshing your complexion. But,peel? No, not really, just a surface  polisher, but for the price, not a bad product to add to your mix of face cosmetics.</li>
    <li> Having said that, I love these peels, I get them on sale when possible and I try to stock up. I have adult acne that just won&#x27;t quit and this stops those red annoyingly deep pimples better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I have used a ton of products over the past 30 years! As long as I can afford these peels these are what I&#x27;ll purchase (been using the product on and off for 2 years, been using just about every day for the past 4 months and am very happy with the way my skin looks).</li>
    <li> I LOVE these little miracles. My face looked the best when I used these. I have strayed trying another brand and I&#x27;m back to these. I am now fearful when I get a recommend to try another at home peel as I feel these are the best.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference.</li>
    <li> I am on my 4th box of 10 face peels pads. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I only use it twice a week and can definitely tell a difference when I skip a day. Would purchase again and again!!&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Makes my skin feel amazing.  A mini facial everyday.</li>
    <li> love it....totally worth the money. tightens face and adds a glow, leaves it soft and smooth too.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do as it says and made me break out!!! it&#x27;s so sticky once you have it on. gross. and I don&#x27;t usually break out.  after a day of using them, i woke up with little bumps on my forehead.</li>
    <li> I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product.  I heard such great things on the morning show I listen to and decided to try it out.  I had high hopes and my expectations were not met.  And even worse, I actually got red marks on my faces for a few days where I had removed some blackheads before using this product.  The product had burned me and left redness for about 3 days.  That was my fault but I suppose.  For the price I would have expected better results.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve used this product a couple of times to deal with some of my mild cyclic breakouts, and I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m especially impressed.  You would expect that for the price (approx. $2/use) it would elicit some pretty significant differences, but it has done nothing more than my Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner, which is about $18/bottle (which lasts me about 3 months with regular use).  As the other reviewers mention, it&#x27;s a good and effective product, but there are items just like it at more affordable prices, not to mention more sanitary and eco-friendly packaging.  I&#x27;ll stick with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are concerned about the dangerous side effects of this product (as detailed in several scary reviews on this site), I have very sensitive, thin, dry skin and have had no problems whatsoever with this.</li>
    <li> After using Proactive for 6 years consistently, it stopped working.  I started breaking out on my face and neck with big red acne that left scars and blemishes.  I&#x27;ve always had very oily skin and was in the market for a product that was multi-functional.  I read the reviews for this product and wanted to give it a try.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money since these Daily Face Peel pads were pretty pricey so I  only bought the one with 10 applications.  After the first night of using my skin felt smooth and fresh. I also noticed that my blemishes were noticeably lighter and my skin wasn&#x27;t as oily throughout the day. It&#x27;s meant for daily use but I only use it twice a week and I cut the pads in half to save money.  A half an application still goes a long way.</li>
    <li> very refreshing on skin. Lightens age spots.</li>
    <li> I bought these because of the good reviews, but I don&#x27;t see a big difference in the way my skin looks at all.</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this wipe. It is very gentle for my sensitive skin. I use it only once a week to give my skin exfoliate.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, great product!</li>
    <li> I can always tell a difference in my skin when I use these!  The only thing I have noticed is that when you stop using them your skin seems to go back.  Being pricey like they are its hard to keep them in stock at home.</li>
    <li> Kind of early for me to be rating this, I have only used this once. It did make me peel with one use. Great for once a week on mature skin. It was recommended to me by a young girl with sensitive skin, she loves it.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Skin glows and as an over 50 user, really notice the difference.  Gentle enough to use everyday but to costly for that.  A few times a week works great.  I have read other reviews that some cut each pad in half and seal the remainder.  Am going to try this.  Certainly a product that really does work.  Wish it wasn&#x27;t  so expensive for the number you get.</li>
