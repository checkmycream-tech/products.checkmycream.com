<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I replace heads on my Norelco annually. In past years I had bought generic heads made by an unknown company, and I found that the combs and cutters in the heads did not fit each other, and were unusable. For the past 3 years or so, I have insisted on Philips&#x27; own brand heads, which do cost about twice as much as the generic. But the quality is there, the cutters and combs fit perfectly, and the shave is like a new Norelco.</li>
    <li> Works great! The shaver is like a new one. It allowed me to keep using the shaver which was a heirloom from a relative.</li>
    <li> I have a Norelco 5845 XL from around 10 years ago. I quit using it because it started pulling hairs rather than cutting them. Then I just forgot about it for 10 years. After seeing the price of the blades and reading the reviews, I purchased these replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent value, and yes the old razor shaves just like the day it was purchased.</li>
    <li> Like new shaves from my 10 year old shaver.  Had trouble determining the replacement head  number I needed at big box stores.  Amazon made it easy, and I saved over $5.00 plus free shipping.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized how badly the old shaver was working until I replaced the blades.  Shaving in a quarter the time now, and it&#x27;s twice as long between charges.</li>
    <li> My Norelco razor is approximately 8 years old and it is difficult to find replacement blades. Amazon is one good source and I have used it the past couple of years. When you can&#x27;t find something try Amazon.</li>
    <li> MAN THAT&#x27;S A CLOSE SHAVE...</li>
    <li> My dad asked if I can find these on line. They are more expensive in your local pharmacy stores and hard to find for that matter. I was so pleased to get a great price from Amazom.com (bought 2 packs). These razor heads last up to a year or longer depending on your beard, my dad won&#x27;t use anything else and says it gives the best shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve changed head blades before, but didn&#x27;t realize just how much difference it really makes.     Essentially, you have a new razor for about $25.  They are really something.    There is a local appliance repair shop that changes batteries very inexpensively as well....in these troubled times, refurbishing some items makes more sense than buying new.  Also, the newer units just don&#x27;t seem as well made as those from a few years back.    You will be pleased!</li>
    <li> I was delightfully surprised when I swapped out the only  heads I had ever had since the shaver was new, with this new set.  It was hard to believe that the shave was so close and done so quickly.  Excellent.  Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I looked all over for these particular replacement blades.  I found everyone but the one I needed. I should have gone to Amazon first.  I would have saved gallons of gas!</li>
    <li> Amazon shipped the wrong item. I had to contact amazon after I returned the item to get my refund. Overall satisfaction is poor.</li>
    <li> Finally got around to repacing my shaver heads after 8 years.  The book says replace them every year?  Oops!  Anyway, they do begin to dull after a few years and now my shaver works good as new. Much easier to order online from Amazon too, rather than tracking to Target or Wallyworld to search for them.</li>
    <li> The item received was just what I needed.  Had trouble finding it in stores as the razor is an older model.  Received it very quickly.  Will order again when needed.</li>
    <li> This product makes my old Norelco razor work like new again.  My old blades were simply unusable.  These are sharp and now I get a smooth shave again.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized I should purchase new heads for my Norelco razor, and was actually thinking of buying a new razor. Buying the replacement heads made my aging Norelco shave like it was brand new! One of the best purchases I ever made.    I plan on buying replacement heads on a regular schedule now.</li>
    <li> Product hard to find as this is a older shaver. Works perfectly, shipped quickly with Super Saver shipping.</li>
    <li> Be sure you have the correct model number wrote down and make sure these are the blades you use and need. I looked for a while and found these blades were the best price I could find. If you can&#x27;t wait for them to be delivered check for stores in your area for them and see if you can buy them at the price they are without the postage and handling charges. They may be a few bucks more but you will have them in your hands.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical going with a generic brand which got mixed reviews. When I discovered these Norelco brand shaving heads at a $10 discount it was easy for me to make up my mind. My shaver now feels like brand new again and I have no regrets with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The shaver heads work just as I expected.  I was not able to find them locally so Amazon really helped.</li>
    <li> Im not sure what others are complaining about.  I got these and made my old razor like new!  This was given to me as a gift 15yrs ago and when it started to give problems i just replace the blades and its as good as it was new.  These shavers were well made and worth every penny.  I recommend changing the blades when it starts to give you trouble and take care of it and keep it clean.   Thanks again jim</li>
    <li> I found that my electric razor was no longer giving me a close shave. I decided to replace the heads because it has been 15 years with the same razor and the same heads.  WOW, what a difference - a nice close shave in just a few minutes.  My suggestion to others is not to wait so long.  I could not find these heads in stores, Amazon had a good price, free shipping and prompt delivery.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Had to find replacement for my father&#x27;s electric razor, searched everywhere, no luck.  Found another shopper suggesting this one.  YES!!!  It worked perfectly on Dad&#x27;s Norelco 5822 XL electric razor.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have purchased a number of items from Amazon... Some were great, others not exactly as expected... Simply stated, this one was exactly as expected &amp; provides exceptional daily results!  It has been difficult to find a replacement blade for this older (although, high end) razor.  I gave it to my father for use by his care provider (he&#x27;s a paitent with altzhiemers), and 7 day a week nursing care)  Amazon did in fact have it, and was shipped as scheduled!    My recommendation, simply put is to buy it if needed! It&#x27;s not likely you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  Thanks for taking time to read my review.</li>
    <li> Thanks for having shaver-heads.  They were the cheapest I could find anywhere and my shaver is like new again....I can shave again without scraping my neck and cheeks!!!Thank you Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Supplier delivered promply and the product worked better than expected.  I can now shave again in 1/2 the time it took with the old blades and is much closer.  Wish the price could have been lower, but still better than Target and Wallmart.</li>
    <li> These new heads did the trick. Sure enough, I will be replacing them more often. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why my beard seemed to be getting tougher to shave every morning. I checked out Amazon&#x27;s offerings and reviews, then realized that I might just need to purchase new heads instead of a whole new shaver, and that my beard actually isn&#x27;t getting any tougher :&lt;)  Anyway, it&#x27;s now a close, smooth shave without the previous difficulty. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> My Norelco shaver is at least 10 years old and keeps running &amp; running.  I&#x27;m glad  can still ger replacement blades for this.  I have no idea what blades to order, but ordering could not be easier.  I just put the shaver model number in the Amazon search box, and presto, there were the blades, and shipping was free.</li>
    <li> The heads were easy to replace although the packaging was the sealed plastic type.  I noticed an immediate improvement in my shaving closeness and comfort.  This was a lot better than buying a new razor, cheaper too.</li>
    <li> Thanks for offering this product for such a great price! The shaver heads work great, a nice close shave for my husband.</li>
    <li> The packaging was mangled, but the price was decent and my husband needed replacement heads. The product itself was not damaged.</li>
    <li> checked the manufacturer&#x27;s website and a few others - this was the best price available. the correct product came as described and arrived when promised. I forgot how great it is to have fresh, sharp shaving heads - now I&#x27;ll make this purchase more often from amazon.com.</li>
    <li> arrived in good time as promised. Item performed as it should, would purchase again from this vendor. I love amazon!</li>
    <li> Blades fit my Norelco 5814XL and worked as advertised. Razor shaves as it did when new. The Norelco doesn&#x27;t shave as close as my Braun but has less drag and pull.</li>
    <li> These are original replacement heads from Philips.  The heads return my shaver to an almost new condition.  They shave very well and close.  They meet my expectations perfectly because they gave my Philips shaver a \\&quot;new lease on life\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of three replacement blades. I have been doing this with Norelco razors for years. The ones I got were in what appeared to be a correct box, but were in an unmarked plastic holder inside. When installed, they made a racket. Then I could see that the metal sleeve for each blade was perfectly round, not at all like the original sleeves which had tiny, sharp metal extensions to hold them in place. So I asked for an exchange, which came quickly. The exchange set was exactly like the first and made the same racket. I sent it back for a refund. I don&#x27;t care what the box says, I did NOT get the correct blades. Someone has packaged the wrong blades in the HQ5 box. I will order elsewhere.    Followup: Now I have found the problem. The Norelco razor I had ordered a year ago from Amazon came with the wrong info booklet. It called for the HQ5 blades I ordered as a replacement. The real number on the razor was worn down so far as to make it almost unreadable. When I finally saw the correct number, I ordered the correct HQ9 blades.    No wonder the ones I first received wouldn&#x27;t fit properly.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Norelco HQ5 Shaving Heads about a month ago. They were very easy to install. It gave me a chance to give the shaver a thorough cleaning too. Shaving now takes less time and feels very smooth. I&#x27;m sure glad I replaced the old heads that were over 6 years old. It&#x27;s like having a new shaver.</li>
    <li> My husband said they did not work at all! Said it did not give a close shave like it should!</li>
    <li> Wow, what a difference!  This was the first set of replacements heads for my older model (5605X) razor.  Simple to install and results are like night &amp; day.  I must remember to replace again in 1 years time.  Nice to spend ~$25 for an effectively new cordless razor.</li>
    <li> THE SHAVING HEADS DID NOT FIT MY RAZOR. THE CODE ON THE HEADS RECEIVED (hq5) IS THE SAME AS HEADS THAT I HAVE  PREVIOUSLY REPLACED. YET, THESE NEW HEADS DO NOT WORK ON MY RAZOR. A CLOSE INSPECTION INDICATES THAT THERE ARE  PHYSICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE NEW HEADS COMPARED TO THE ONES THAT WORK. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND FEEL THAT   I WASTED MY MONEY. I WOULD WELCOME A REFUND SO THAT MY FAITH IN ORDERING FROM AMAZON COULD BE RESTORED.    [[ASIN:B000050B6B Philips Norelco HQ5 Shaving Heads]]</li>
    <li> Since I couldn&#x27;t find any stores that sold these, I had to buy them online. It was easy to find them, and the shipping was fairly quick. The product itself came just as described (except they didn&#x27;t come in the Norelco box, just the clamshell plastic), and they were easy to put on the razor. I haven&#x27;t replaced my shaver heads in over 2 years, and needless to say, these heads cut WAY closer than my old ones! All-around a good experience.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice, also read brochure and realized I had been applying to much pressure on shaver head. Everything works better now and I may get longer life out of new blades. Purchase from Amazon best buy on the network. Thanks</li>
    <li> I have waited 5 days for them to ship this item out. I have sent two letters asking why the order is sitting in shipping and not being processed. If you need this soon I suggest you order it with quick shipment or they will hold it for a week.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Felt the difference in my shave immediately, much closer and no irritation</li>
    <li> After reading a number of negative reviews of generic shaving heads, I decided to go with the OEM shaving heads.  It had been about 2.5 years since the last time I replaced the shaving heads, and the new ones made a huge difference.  I now get a closer shave in less time.  I&#x27;m happy that I spent the extra few dollars for a product that I could trust.</li>
    <li> I was tempted to buy a new electric razor because mine was underperfoming. Changing the cutter head turned out to be a 15 second effort and the razor is like new.</li>
    <li> It was getting more difficult each day to shave. It took longer and the shave was not very close. One of the blade sleeves broke and I was forced to buy a new set. When the new blades arrived I put them in the shaver and shaved. Just like new. A smooth, fast, effortless shave.</li>
    <li> I needed the HQ5 Norelco Shaving Head that was not available in any local stores.  It was not available from Norelco either..&lt;br /&gt;The only place that had the product was your firm...Amazon... so I had to procure it from your company as the shaver&lt;br /&gt;was still in useable shape....THE ONLY PROBLEM  I HAD WITH THE TRANSACTION (WHICH I HAD TO MAKE IF I&lt;br /&gt;WANTED TO CONTINUE TO USE THE RAZOR )  was that your price was $75.00++ AND THAT WAS over priced..&lt;br /&gt;Generally, the head would be significantly less costly if it were  purchased locally or at Norelco..  I learned from&lt;br /&gt;the transaction that I should stay away from AMAZON on future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;A. A. ROBERTY....aaroberty@comcast.net.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this replacement head before and they work great.  New blades always give a better shave.  Will do it again.</li>
    <li> Worth the extra money,wasted money by trying cheap verison,they dont give you a close shave and didnt fit right in my norelco.It&#x60;s true YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!</li>
    <li> good price too. They need more words but what else do you say? OK now  I need seven more words.</li>
    <li> The vender was the only one who listed my razor model number which allowed me to be sure I was getting the correct model of replacement heads.</li>
    <li> As several other reviews have mentioned, Amazon yet again sent out the wrong item to me!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Amazon&#x27;s credit, exchange was painless. Why not be more carefully at the first place and avoid the same mistake?</li>
    <li> The Norelco replacement head I bought through Amazon cut right through the hassle I would have had finding this item in Manhattan&#x27;s labyrinth of specialty shops. Thanks Amazon and Norelco for a   smooth deal.    Jack G.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many Norelco razors in my 50 years of shaving with all being renewed  with a fresh set of heads after a few years. Every Norelco I owned always failed  the switch so be mindful of that if you want new heads.     Switch OK? Then buy new heads and keep on shavin&#x27;</li>
    <li> The advertisements are correct, you really should regularly replace your shaver heads. My Norelco works like new now. And the ordering was very easy.</li>
    <li> You really won&#x27;t believe the difference between your old worn out blades and these new replacements. It&#x27;s like getting a new shaver: clean, smooth, quick shaving.</li>
    <li> At one time in the past I searched through a number of different stores to find the best price for these Norelco blades.  The cheapest price I found was at K Mart.  This was maybe five years ago, and they cost $36 dollars and change then.  I bought these blades at amazon for $26.00 and change.  This is a huge savings.  These blades are expensive.  This is a great great deal, and since this product cost over twentyfive dollars the shipping was free.  To go to K Mart and back would have cost me two or more dollars in gas.  These days these blades probably cost a lot more than they did five years ago so overall I believe I saved at least fourteen dollars on something that costs maybe thirtyeight dollars.  That is a huge savings.  Thanks amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong type. I purchased them for my father. So I sent them back. Amazon refunded my money right away and I reordered the correct heads. No problem!</li>
    <li> have always had perfect relationship with amazon...the norelco shaver heads, I have order before..that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ordering again....I get quick service and the price is great...thanks,    j-moore.</li>
    <li> This shaver head eliminates buying a new electric  shaver.  It was easy to install and I received it  soon after I ordered it.   The service was great.</li>
    <li> I replaced the dull baldes and new heads were installed. I was disappointed in the results after shaving.  I would have been better off purchasing a new razor.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s like I have a brand new razor.</li>
    <li> Expensive. After shaving, the skin feels like it was burning. Need to use a pre-shave lotion for a better results. Not convinced the&lt;br /&gt;blades are genuine Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy a new razor when these are worn out.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly, easy to order, good value &amp; just what my husband needed, but couldn&#x27;t find in the local marketplace.</li>
    <li> 2nd time I had to change my heads.  Good shaver after all these years; however, this time the heads are not \\&quot;cutting\\&quot; it.  No clean shave at all.  Maybe it&#x27;s time to get a new shaver after 10 years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to give anything a really bad review, but I  have to give these a 1 star or less. They may say Phillips Norelco on the box, but they ran loose and loud in the razor and just scraped the heck out of my face. Do not waste you money on these blades. I just threw them right in the trash.</li>
    <li> It may seem like an unnecessary expense, but replacing your razor&#x27;s heads every year is the best thing you can do. After 365 shaves, the blades do start to dull, even though no physical wear is evident. Replacing the heads gives you a fresh start so that you can experience the closest and most comfortable shave possible.</li>
    <li> I try to keep my Norelco razor cutters as operational as possible through weekly brushing of the shavings and bi-monthly full cleaning but eventually they do wear out - replacing the cutters definitely gives me a closer shave.</li>
    <li> Well worthwhile to buy new heads, as others have noticed.  New life for my older shaver!</li>
    <li> After searching various stores, only to find razors either not there or too expensive, it was a relief to find them on Amazon at a reasonable price.  Product also arrived in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have an old mdl.5822xl Norelco triple header razor and wondered if I could still get heads for it,no need,these heads fit perfectly.they also cut my shaving time in half,wow,sharp blades,who knew?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers all my life and these heads didn&#x27;t disappoint.    As usual, everything with Amazon and this purchase was terrific.  Because of today&#x27;s terrible economy, however, a few days after I got these they were even cheaper in local stores when they dropped prices.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the purchase.  After going to many stores and finding high prices or no inventory I decided to purchase on line.    Smooth shaves are back!</li>
    <li> We ordered the replacement heads for the Norelco electric shaver.  It&#x27;s amazing how much better the shaver works with new heads.  The product was as advertised and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My son asked for a new razor before heading off to college.  With all the other expenses incurred for this move, I decided to try your replacement shaving heads (rather than making a new razor purchase).  WOW!!!  These were so easy to install and he feels like his razor is completely new.  These replacement shaving heads work GREAT.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old heads.  They are great!  Saving money is a top priority for me and I didn&#x27;t really need a new shaver.  Replacing the Norelco heads made sense.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found that replacing the shaving heads really improves the performance of my shaver.  &lt;br /&gt;By the way, the Norelco HQ5 supports the following Norelco models: 5887XL, 5886XL, 5885XL, 5867XL, 5865XL, 5864XL, 5863XL, 5862XL, 5861XL, 5855XL, 5849XL, 5848XL, 5845XL, 5841XL, 5825XL, 5821XL, 5814XL, 5811XL, 5802XL, 5801XL, 5669XL, 5602XD, 5601X, Q-One.</li>
    <li> What can you say about razor blades?  These are great and now I can use my razor again without having it feel like an epilady on my face.  What a concept!</li>
    <li> Shaver is pretty old and this is the 2nd set of replacement blades. They last quite a long time. Will probably replace the blades until the shaver itself gives up.</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find these at Amazon.com.  I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere else.  You are a lifesaver, because my husband only uses his Norelco razer.  You can&#x27;t find the new replacment heads in any store.  Thank you![[ASIN:B000068PBT Philips Norelco HQ8  Spectra Tripleheader Replacement Heads]]</li>
    <li> Buying the name brand &amp;#34;Philips Norelco shaving heads&amp;#34; resulted in a much better connection to the rotating heads and thus a much better shave than the previous generic replacement heads. However, for the price you can almost buy a complete new electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have an older razor and was worried about not being able to get the correct blades. These work great.</li>
    <li> I had a philips norelco  5822 XL its an older model that takes theses HQ5 shaving heads. The local stores don&#x27;t carry them anymore, And when they did they were in the 40 dollar range, This cost just a little over half and shipping was free. The goods were shipped in a timely fashion and that is that. I can shave with compfort again. With the age of my shaver, I don&#x27;t know how long HQ5&#x27;s will be around, I will buy them again from Amazon.com</li>
    <li> I sent the product back because it did not work.   The seller did not want me to return the item, but finally agreed.  I have yet to receive my refund and it been almost two weeks since the product was returned.</li>
    <li> Easy to install. It makes my 10 year old shaver work like new.  I will never go that long between head changes again.</li>
    <li> Since this razor is out of date, I had trouble finding replacement parts.  These were just as described, and my husband can use his favorite razor again</li>
    <li> The electric razor blades were delivered in record time and the product was in excellent condition-as advertised.</li>
    <li> I ordered the HQ5 blades for my almost 10 year old Norelco 5814 shaver for the $26.99 + free shipping and they were on my doorstep on the 9th day (which was to be expected &amp; actually 1 day before the expected delivery date) after the order was placed.  It was kind of a joke how easy it was to swap out the old blades with the new ones.  It took more time cleaning the shaver before installing the new blades which was pretty simple and took all of 20-30 seconds.  I kept thinking this is too easy and really thought I must be missing something.  Works great now.  For all looking for replacement rotary blades, this was the cheapest $$ I found.  Even directly thru the internet with Norelco it was $32.99 + $3.50 shipping and since I live in CA there would have been 8.75% state sales tax added.  Even other sites had it for $25.00 + around $5.00 shipping so I thought this was the best deal and personally never have had problems with all of my other Amazon orders.  Bottom line, it sure beats going out and buying a new shaver for $60-80 when the old ones works just fine.  4 stars just because it was for an old shaver.</li>
    <li> I was searching the department stores in my area to no avail ... I finally found these and were more than satisfy</li>
    <li> There is nothing special about the shaving heads, they are what they are, no more, no less.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time &amp; without issue. It was exactly what we were looking for &amp; fit perfectly in my Norelco 5801XL model.</li>
    <li> The cutters appear to be  a little less durable than the originals but  after about 6 months are still doing the job. The price was right so I would recommend them</li>
    <li> Worked well for several years.  Pricey though.</li>
    <li> hard to find replacement blades for old shavers with good motors - these were still available and worked just fine</li>
    <li> Same as what came with my razor. Also get some of the head cleaner it works well also. I guess you should replace these once a year it does make a difference in your shave.</li>
    <li> I bought a Norelco shaver a couple of years ago and love it...but the blades wore down so I decided to buy new ones.  The model number of the shaver recommended I use the HQ5 head so I bought it on Amazon.  WRONG.....they are completely different and don&#x27;t fit.  So now I have to go through the ordeal of returning them.  After manufacturing such a phenomenal product, Norelco failed on the post sale support big time.</li>
    <li> Everyone knows Norelco shavers are the best if you don&#x27;t use manual blades.  I bought these for my dad as part of his father&#x27;s day presents, he&#x27;s still raving about them making the shaver like new again. And from amazon - wicked cheap.</li>
    <li> the razor is lasting a long time, the blades do their job and I have no reason to buy another.  Someday Norelco will stop making them just to make me spend money on a new razor.  But until then, I&#x27;m clean shaven and happy</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Philips Norelco HQ5 Shaving Heads, has bought them before, and I&#x27;m sure he will buy them again!</li>
    <li> The original heads lasted a very long time, they were made in  the USA, the second replacement set were purchased thru Amazon, and were made in either Taiwan or China, and they did not last at all.  Got very dull very quickly, now this set is made in Holad, lets see how long they last.  Hopefully they will be much better than the second set.</li>
    <li> Like a new shaver,  better than replacement</li>
    <li> Said it would work for the shaver my husband has and didn&#x27;t.  Just through it in the trash.  For the price of the heads one can almost buy a new shaver.  So that is what I will continue to do without any compaints from my husband that we should be buying heads.  Wrong.</li>
    <li> Great replacement head.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, wanted @ the right price!</li>
    <li> Norelco heads made his razor like new.  Gets a much better shave.  His face is much cleaner and softer now.</li>
    <li> The Norelco HQ5 Reflex Action Tripleheader Replacement Heads was an item my adult son specified on his Christmas Gift wish list.  He said the replacemenyt heads for his current Norelco would be preferable to a different kind of new  razor at a price comparable to that of the replacement heads.  He has a dark, heavy beard, and this is the razor and replacement he uses and likes.</li>
    <li> The blades were easy to install and made the razor work like it did when it was new</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed Norelco products.  These replacement blades are great.  They offer a very close shave and do not cause irritation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement heads for my Norelco 5821XL which I bought 25 years ago. I&#x27;ve been to countless stores to find these old heads, but have never had any success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after 25 years, I replaced the original heads, and boy does it make a difference in the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go figure.</li>
    <li> These replacement heads are perfect for my Dad&#x27;s old razor. He said it works just like new. I hope they become available again.</li>
    <li> Was listed to fit my husbands razor and when it arrived it was not the right heads.</li>
    <li> It is one of the best products made and they seem to last quite awhile before you need to reorder.</li>
    <li> Instead of taking my razor to a shop to replace the batteries and the shaving heads, I decided to do it myself.  All is well, and I will treat myself with the money and time I saved.</li>
    <li> I had never changed the blades in my Norelco electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement blades renewed the shaving excellence I expected from my razor.</li>
    <li> Easy to replace. The shaver works beautifully now. I should have sent for replacement heads a long time ago. A little less expensive would have made it even better.</li>
    <li> THE SHAVING HEAD AND BLADE FIT THE NORELCO JUST FINE. THEY LOOK AS GOOD AS THE OEM. I WOULD BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> For a while, I was having trouble finding this model of head for some reason.  Was glad to see these for sale at a reasonable price.  I was thinking of going to a safety blade and brush but this is still way more convenient.</li>
    <li> This item was as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, why so expensive?  In hindsight, I would have been better off just buying a new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Is this item discontinued?  Hard to get? or what??&lt;br /&gt;I would like to hear from the seller to explain and/or justify the selling price.&lt;br /&gt;I liked this model of Norelco so much, I bought the replacement heads anyway.  But probably never again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for months now and they work OK.  A bit noisier than my originals but they do work nicely on my beard.</li>
    <li> No I didn&#x27;t have an object pointed at me when I placed the order but at twice the original price what else can I say.&lt;br /&gt;This mimics a collectible price....but I opened the box.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find that I could still get the shaving heads for my husbands shaver. He is very happy</li>
    <li> My razor must be about twenty years old now, and this is probably the third set of shaving heads for me. It shaves like new again!</li>
    <li> my husband needed this for his shaver and he is still using it and it was a good price. thanks</li>
    <li> I wish these were still available for a reasonable price from the manufacturer as they are quite expensive on the aftermarket.  That said, they work quite nicely and I&#x27;m glad I bought them in preference to cheaper Chinese made ones which have been uniformly reported as not working well at all.</li>
    <li> The heads were not in an original Phillips package so they could have been &amp;#34;knock-offs&amp;#34; bt they work OK</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, reasonable price, very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Great new shave after using them. I like how Amazon tells you when you order a product like this the date of the last order.  I had gone a little too long with my old heads, big difference with new.</li>
    <li> Quick service and good price. Worked fine in the razor. I expect to buy them again when the time comes.</li>
    <li> Bought to have on hand. Shaver works gpod</li>
    <li> I have had my Norelco 5861 XL for more years than I care to remember and it is getting harder and harder to find these replacement blades.  It seems so silly to pay so much for the blades when it seems like you can get a new razor for just a bit more than these replacement blades cost.  HOWEVER, I bought a new Norelco 10 years or so ago (because of the replacement blade cost issue) and immediately returned it - the new one was flimsy, made of cheap plastic, and, in general, felt like it would crumble.  My old razor is built like a tank and works great.  So, to keep using the old razor I love, I need to, unfortunately, buy these very expensive replacement blades every 2 years or so.  The better trade off for me.  File this as more of a negative review of the new Norelco razors, than so much a negative review of these blades other than the cost.  They just don&#x27;t build stuff like they used to!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the unit for over 7 years now.  All it needs is a new pair of blades, and they cut great!</li>
