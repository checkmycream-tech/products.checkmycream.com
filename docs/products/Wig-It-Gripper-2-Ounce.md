      <li>Clean up easy!!!</li>
      <li>I liked the wig</li>
      <li>They gave it back.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us liked this product.</li>
      <li>but I honestly think its just ok.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this much more than any adhesive or tape.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll have to wash your wig more often when you use this.</li>
      <li>Never had anything like this before, I love the way this product is working for me.</li>
      <li>but if u know what you are doing will will love this product...</li>
      <li>I tried to love this</li>
      <li>Your better off sewing some clips in your wig</li>
      <li>so your wig is more secured.</li>
      <li>so i ordered it here  on amazon  if i get more lace</li>
      <li>I mean GRIPPED!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This would be really good for shaving or if you want to get rid of unwanted hair, this would be perfect for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love full lace wigs, but adhesives are not for me.</li>
      <li>and it looked as if it would glide on effortlessly and give a secure fit.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s alright for a light hold in the front and sides of a wig.</li>
      <li>Great stuff for keeping a wig on for a short time - though it makes your wig gooey...</li>
      <li>This stuff works wonderfully, it really holds the units in place, really feels good on my hair line.</li>
      <li>This is a good back up if you run out of tape or glue.</li>
      <li>This product is super stick</li>
      <li>It is a gripper,it has just enough tack which is great for gripping the lace keeping it flat and holding it in place.</li>
      <li>No residue was left on the wig and the product by the end of the day just absorbed into my hair becoming more like a pomade than sticky gel, so I never had to removed it.</li>
      <li>a great little item to try if you wear your wigs temporarily.</li>
      <li>u need to use a scalp and hair protector before use....and make sure the wig u use is new...not an old lace front...</li>
      <li>I honestly have no idea of the proper way to remove it.</li>
      <li>In my opinion, it works better with Swiss lace than French lace, but still works.</li>
      <li>This was my first product that I bought for my lace wigs but as you ladies know when you go to wigs you have to try everything until you know what will work for you.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really do the job!</li>
      <li>When I first saw the youtube video of the girl using this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
      <li>Just a bottle of \\&quot;HOT MESS\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>When first,  I purchased this product</li>
      <li>Please be sure to purchase the polisher with it and even then this product is very hard to wash out of your own hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard and stickey and really doesn&#x27;t give that great of a hold.</li>
      <li>After have cancer and not cutting my hair trying to save it with most of my hair was saved due to braiding by my front is destroyed.</li>
      <li>when i first got the wig gripper i tried it, and it did pretty good with my lace front wig, just be careful that you dont put on to much,and yes i will definitely order again.</li>
      <li>and I have a hard time getting a good grip.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Shipping time was reasonable.</li>
      <li>The stuff is very sticky and it feels yucky on your wig.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>it really makes the lace blend in.</li>
      <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t have the patience to really take the time to make it work.  </li>
      <li>Its sticky like glue and gets everywhere but it doesn&#x27;t hold very well.</li>
      <li>I am so very disappionted and dissatified.</li>
      <li>IT IS VERY STICKY, but that&#x27;s what helps it</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t care too much for it.</li>
      <li>This is an absolute nightmare:</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very sticky.</li>
      <li>it was pulling my hair so much</li>
      <li>Plus it makes the area where it&#x27;s applied look very greasy.</li>
      <li>By itself, it doesn&#x27;t really hold for more than 2+/- hours without the wig slipping.  </li>
      <li>I do buy glueless wigs, which I usually wear with my hair (wig) down,  but when I want to wear it up where the edges will show this product is best for me.</li>
      <li>wow that the right name for this gripper because it is a gripper</li>
      <li>However it works better than any other edge control product.  </li>
      <li>Then, I tried just a dab of it with my hair wet (just spritzed with water or a leave in) brushed it down - perfect!</li>
      <li>I used a regular sheen spray on a Q-tip without any problem to clean off, I  noticed also that  the lace did not get a lot of residue once removed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product may not be for everyone, but for someone who wants to take off their wig at night, HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>I found it to be messy and really didn&#x27;t stick unless it was touching your real hair.</li>
      <li>but i use that on lace fronts that i now i will only wear for the week..since i cant wear the same wig for more than week....</li>
      <li>new one...also make sure u use a little bit...</li>
      <li>It holds very well, but trying to clean up the residue will require the use of something a little stronger than soap and water.</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hold your natural hair .but</li>
      <li>I brought this because I saw a young lady on YouTube use it on her lace front</li>
      <li>I listened to a young lady on youtube and bought this.</li>
      <li>but I will give it the old college try again.</li>
      <li>So for work I have to wake up early just to apply this stuff.</li>
      <li>I really should of listen to the reviews...not only that it took FOREVER to ship!</li>
      <li>mis-use, over use and sensitive hairlines.</li>
      <li>It is sticky, and gummy and hard to apply and clean up.</li>

<li> mis-use, over use and sensitive hairlines.</li>
<li> It is sticky, and gummy and hard to apply and clean up.</li>
<li> It holds the lace down on a lace front for a few hours, but it is very sticky!</li>
<li> so i read reviews negative and positive....</li>
<li> Its very sticky and hard to remove.</li>
<li> it is very sticking but that doesn&#x27;t mean that is works.</li>
<li> It won&#x27;t hold the back of your lace or wig not strong enough.</li>
<li> This stuff was a gooey mess, I sent it back.</li>
<li> only used just a little</li>
<li> a little goes a long long way...</li>
<li> Was not what I expected.</li>
<li> THIS PRODUCT IS TOO MESSY AND IT LAST FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES</li>
<li> If you aren&#x27;t careful, it can pull hair out.</li>
<li> , we all know that sometimes the lace can be scratchy, but with the gripper it really helped by just keeping it in one place which kept the edges from moving around and irritating the hairline .Overall</li>
<li> After like two tries I threw it away.</li>
<li> so I only used the product a few times after seeing this being reviewed on YouTube.</li>
<li> I like it but the only thing is be careful because it can get ooey gooey messy.</li>
<li> I tried shampoo, soap and water, alcohol, oil sheen, and finally just plain olive oil (which worked for me).  </li>
<li> B careful because little goes a long ways.</li>
<li> other thing which was a plus</li>
<li> should have taken heed of the other reviews of this product.  </li>
<li> Be very careful while applying or it will  get every where.</li>
<li> You can wash off with mild soap and wig or lace with cream of nature shampoo in cold water.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is just a mess.  Very sticky and the will NOT secure your wigs.  DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> After have cancer and not cutting my hair trying to save it with most of my hair was saved due to braiding by my front is destroyed. Gripper is good so you do not have to use glue or tape for your wigs but you can get glueless wigs now so I only used the product a few times after seeing this being reviewed on YouTube. Unfortunately, it pulled some of my front hairline out and is too sticky for me. This was my first product that I bought for my lace wigs but as you ladies know when you go to wigs you have to try everything until you know what will work for you.</li>
    <li> This was not really a good purchase. I don&#x27;t use it because it doesn&#x27;t really work. Its just sticky and gooey feeling.</li>
    <li> Hi I purchased the item a few weeks ago,I do not glue any of my wigs because at some point the glues do pull your hair out due to&lt;br /&gt; mis-use, over use and sensitive hairlines. So I saw this on Youtube with( PreCi0uSsS )and thought I would try it. Everyone this is not a glue! It is a gripper,it has just enough tack which is great for gripping the lace keeping it flat and holding it in place.This is a temporary hold for those who take off their wigs at night not a glue!&lt;br /&gt;I found you need just a tiny bit around the edges and to remove I used a regular sheen spray on a Q-tip without any problem to clean off, I  noticed also that  the lace did not get a lot of residue once removed.&lt;br /&gt;One other thing which was a plus, we all know that sometimes the lace can be scratchy, but with the gripper it really helped by just keeping it in one place which kept the edges from moving around and irritating the hairline .Overall a great little item to try if you wear your wigs temporarily.</li>
    <li> This stuff is garbage...I really should of listen to the reviews...not only that it took FOREVER to ship! the stuff is nasty sticky! it gets in your hair and takes days to get the sticky feeling out of your hair...! it gets every where and its just a basic jar of goo</li>
    <li> I like this  stuff but its sticky  it gets every where  take the glosser  and  take it out at night  I did look for in my local beauty supply store but didnt find it so i ordered it here  on amazon  if i get more lace front ill continue to use  it &#x27;</li>
    <li> This sticks to everything but your head and it was a tacky mess. doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> This stuff was a gooey mess, I sent it back.</li>
    <li> This was very messy ! And gave no stability to the wig !</li>
    <li> WAIST OF TIME, JUST BOUGHT GLUE INSTEAD</li>
    <li> I think this product is great you just have to know how to use it. Of course, everyone&#x27;s hair is different as well as their hair needs and expectations. I love full lace wigs, but adhesives are not for me. I do buy glueless wigs, which I usually wear with my hair (wig) down,  but when I want to wear it up where the edges will show this product is best for me. When first,  I purchased this product it was so sticky I couldn&#x27;t get it applied it was pulling my hair so much and when I did it was globbed. I almost threw it out. Then, I tried just a dab of it with my hair wet (just spritzed with water or a leave in) brushed it down - perfect! No residue was left on the wig and the product by the end of the day just absorbed into my hair becoming more like a pomade than sticky gel, so I never had to removed it. In my opinion, it works better with Swiss lace than French lace, but still works. You can ask any reviewer a question so if you&#x27;re still unsure,  I would say ask the positives why they like it and how they used it and the negatives why they don&#x27;t and again how they used it, and then decide. IT IS VERY STICKY, but that&#x27;s what helps it GRiP! I prefer this much more than any adhesive or tape.</li>
    <li> It holds very well, but trying to clean up the residue will require the use of something a little stronger than soap and water. If you aren&#x27;t careful, it can pull hair out.</li>
    <li> I got this thinking it&#x27;s a glue, yes I should have read the reviews  it&#x27;s not a good and it didn&#x27;t even give me a temporary.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t stick well at all would not buy again waste of money</li>
    <li> Will not order again. Was not what I expected. I even gave it away to a friend. They gave it back.&lt;br /&gt;Neither of us liked this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. Way to sticky. If it gets on your fingers it just has to wear off.&lt;br /&gt;Yuck</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really do the job! very messy!!!! Clean up easy!!!</li>
    <li> When I first saw the youtube video of the girl using this product I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. Once the order was received and I tried it, it not only took my hair out it didn&#x27;t hold the wig down. I would never recommend this to anybody!&lt;br /&gt;I only used just a little and it still gripped the hair from my sidelines away! I mean GRIPPED!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;This would be really good for shaving or if you want to get rid of unwanted hair, this would be perfect for that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean GRIPPED!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be called GRIPP AWAY!</li>
    <li> This is some messy gooey stuff thats not worth my money.  I will never ever buy this again.  Just a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This does not work. Just go the glueless route, and save yourself and your edges the hassle. This was a pointless purchase. Wish I could get my money back.</li>
    <li> Well it will hold the wig down , so it will perform as described. Problem is it will ripp out your edges.</li>
    <li> This product is very messy and seems to stick to everything except your lace front. Plus it makes the area where it&#x27;s applied look very greasy. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
    <li> wow that the right name for this gripper because it is a gripper&lt;br /&gt;hold very nice if you know what you are doing if not its best to let some one who do&lt;br /&gt;or you will get Gripper</li>
    <li> This was one of the most awful products I have ever purchased. It almost ruined my very expensive full lace wig and it did not work. DO NOT waist your money on this product.</li>
    <li> It holds the lace down on a lace front for a few hours, but it is very sticky! Also, this is very DIFFICULT to get out of your hair if it gets on there, even after multiple shampoos.</li>
    <li> Please be sure to purchase the polisher with it and even then this product is very hard to wash out of your own hair.  However it works better than any other edge control product.  Just has build up after 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> This item does not work and is a waste of money. Your better off sewing some clips in your wig</li>
    <li> Waste of money..does not hold wig in place at all no matter how much you use. Just a bottle of \\&quot;HOT MESS\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I understand this is not a glue and is not suppose to have the hold like a glue. However, it is just gooey and does nothing to hold the wig in place. It does smell very good and conditions well.</li>
    <li> Work just like it say it will do. Although you will need to be very careful when applying it, can be very messy.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS TOO MESSY AND IT LAST FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES DID NT LIKE IT SORRY</li>
    <li> I like it but it pulls and hurts a little. It&#x27;s also very sticky. Be very careful while applying or it will  get every where.</li>
    <li> It is not what I thought it would be, it just dose not hold the wig in place like it is said to do.</li>
    <li> Great stuff for keeping a wig on for a short time - though it makes your wig gooey... you&#x27;ll have to wash your wig more often when you use this.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it suppose too.</li>
    <li> Its very sticky and hard to remove.</li>
    <li> This stuff works wonderfully, it really holds the units in place, really feels good on my hair line. Great stuff</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work the hold just wasn&#x27;t there and it&#x27;s way too sticky almost like a glue, which is weird you&#x27;d think it would hold. And  It pulled out some of my hair.</li>
    <li> I recently order the Wig It Gripper last month because of the you tube video I seen..although it had horrible ratings I still order it..and I should have listen ..waste of money it dont stick and its very messy ..it almost like glue..I hated it</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hold your natural hair .but not for wigs</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004BG6B2U Wig It Gripper 2 oz. Jar]]&lt;br /&gt;I should have taken heed of the other reviews of this product.  The stuff is very sticky and it feels yucky on your wig.  I tried to use it on a brand new expensive lace front and all it resulted in doing was making my lace front look greasy around the edges.  I ended up having to wash my wig before even wearing it and that caused me extra work! I liked the wig it glosser, but stay away from from this useless goo!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care too much for it. It&#x27;s alright for a light hold in the front and sides of a wig. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
    <li> poor does not work too sticky pulls hair out</li>
    <li> Nope!!!! this product did not do what it was intended to do. This product is super stick and I wish I would have kept my money no matter how small the cost.</li>
    <li> I listened to a young lady on youtube and bought this. Wow! This is an absolute nightmare:( This stuff is out of control. It is sticky, and gummy and hard to apply and clean up. I am so very disappionted and dissatified. It doesn&#x27;t hold and I am really sorry that I bought it. After like two tries I threw it away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard and stickey and really doesn&#x27;t give that great of a hold. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to  work with it takes long to  dry. ..makes  messy work</li>
    <li> when i first got the wig gripper i tried it, and it did pretty good with my lace front wig, just be careful that you dont put on to much,and yes i will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It is neat....it really makes the lace blend in. Allot people got fooled since the hair looked like it was growing out of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping time was reasonable.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed. Never had anything like this before, I love the way this product is working for me.</li>
    <li> I purchased this after watching a you tube video this stuff is awful I believe the person on you tube was paid to post that product</li>
    <li> take it off the market not good</li>
    <li> I only used this item on the edges of my wig and the wig kept lifting and I had to keep pressing it down all day and the gripper kept getting on my fingers, this is not for me.</li>
    <li> I gave one star because it was sticky! If you are a heavy sweater this is not for you. Does it hold? Yes but a minimum hold. It won&#x27;t hold the back of your lace or wig not strong enough. It&#x27;s kinda like a thick honey in a jar. I would not order again. Oh! You can wash off with mild soap and wig or lace with cream of nature shampoo in cold water.</li>
    <li> I tried this in varying amounts with different types of lace. This crap is extremely tacky and sticky, but did not hold the lace in place AT ALL, not even once. It has the consistency of Hick&#x27;s edge control mixed with glue, so it was difficult to wash out of my hair and off of my skin! I tried shampoo, soap and water, alcohol, oil sheen, and finally just plain olive oil (which worked for me).  Don&#x27;t bother with this mess!! Instead, use Gorilla Snot or Got2B glued gel (the black bottle). There are several how-to videos on Youtube that show you how to apply them. Both methods worked for me.</li>
    <li> Its sticky like glue and gets everywhere but it doesn&#x27;t hold very well. Not worth the money I paid for it. Kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> Dont waste your money. Does not hold, and creates an adhesive on your lace that is not easy to remove.</li>
    <li> This product does not grip anything. It just makes everything sticky and tacky and not good for the summer. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. B careful because little goes a long ways. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> I brought this because I saw a young lady on YouTube use it on her lace front and it looked as if it would glide on effortlessly and give a secure fit. BOY WAS I WRONG! It’s so Messy, Sticky and hard to work with! Just all over the place messy! This stuff is hell trying to get off your fingers, hairline and even the hair of the wig. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this stuff to anyone. I don’t know how the creators of this product are still in business! This stuff is garbage.  Yes, it will hold the wig securely…as well has your fingers and anything else it comes in contact with. I honestly have no idea of the proper way to remove it. It gives ZERO instructions on how.</li>
    <li> This product may not be for everyone, but for someone who wants to take off their wig at night, HIGHLY recommended. The best way I could describe this product is in this video. The says it all! I hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5diplyC5o3w</li>
    <li> Leaves hairline a sticky mess. Does not stick as indicated, would not buy this product again. Not good for lace wigs.</li>
    <li> I like it but the only thing is be careful because it can get ooey gooey messy. So for work I have to wake up early just to apply this stuff.</li>
    <li> I tried to love this but I honestly think its just ok.  Maybe I don&#x27;t have the patience to really take the time to make it work.  I find it too sticky to mess with and I have a hard time getting a good grip.  Again, it could be user error but I will give it the old college try again.</li>
    <li> so i read reviews negative and positive....i dont understand what the problem is...key point u need to use a scalp and hair protector before use....and make sure the wig u use is new...not an old lace front...new one...also make sure u use a little bit...a little goes a long long way...this product is great if you have a favorite lace front that you dont wanna ruin with glue.....i still prefer glue but i use that on lace fronts that i now i will only wear for the week..since i cant wear the same wig for more than week....gripper is a great alternative to saving those great ones....everyone will have different experience with this product- but if u know what you are doing will will love this product...</li>
    <li> Messy sticky on everything but the reason I purchased it. I will NEVER purchase it again!</li>
    <li> I am of the impression that I just don&#x27;t know how to use this product. It is so sticky you cant even begin to use it without sticking your entire body! I need a REFUND !!</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Sigma Bond Lace front Adhesive  By itself, it doesn&#x27;t really hold for more than 2+/- hours without the wig slipping.  It you think this is going to replace tape or glue for a long hold time, you are wrong.</li>
    <li> IF YOU RUNOUT, OF TABS FOR YOUR WIG. THEN WIG IT GRIPPER, IS&lt;br /&gt;JUST WHAT YOU NEED. THIS PRODUCT IS REALLY EXCELLENT, FOR KEEP YOUR WIG IN PLACE.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It does hold you wig edges down so your wig is more secured. It works like glue but doesnt have the chemicals like glue.</li>
    <li> it is very sticking but that doesn&#x27;t mean that is works. I found it to be messy and really didn&#x27;t stick unless it was touching your real hair.</li>
    <li> This is a good back up if you run out of tape or glue. But it&#x27;s not glue so don&#x27;t expect it to stick like glue.</li>
