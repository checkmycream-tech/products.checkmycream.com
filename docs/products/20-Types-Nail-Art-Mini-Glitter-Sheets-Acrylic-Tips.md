<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Product came in the time it was suppose to.  Its just typical nail glitter.</li>
    <li> I had read the customer reviews and should have known better then to waste my time and money on this product.  It took literally 3 weeks to received and when I did I had 8 gold stars, 3 orange stars, 3 green beads, 2 red beads, 3 silver beads, and one purple star which was dumped out in the bag.  I strictly bought this for the glitter and the crushed shells.  I am very disappointed as I was looking forward to this for weeks!!  I e-mailed sender and have not heard anything back.  If anyone has had this problem and it has been resolved in some way or another please e-mail me at jts1323@live.com.</li>
    <li> Great colors and a few nail clavier bottles, but they are very very tiny. My daughter liked them. Great price.</li>
    <li> there&#x27;s a lot of stars and hearts in different color. But for the price. It&#x27;s good. I like it. There&#x27;s at least 2 of each color. I used it for my toes after I painted them. and they were cute.</li>
    <li> We did like the variety.  We have yet to use them, but are anxious.  I liked that some were flat and others were beads.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the creations.</li>
    <li> I bought a few other fingernail products but by far I like this the best. The only reason its not five stars is because of the time it takes to deliver, but they were up front on how long it would take so I knew that going in.  Each bottle is full to the top.  All different patterns.</li>
    <li> I order this glitters and even thought they&#x27;re very tiny I like them the bottles are so tiny and cute ,the best part the gifts , I received two! thanks,they also came in at the excepted time</li>
    <li> No matter what I do can&#x27;t get them to stay on!</li>
    <li> These are the worst ever. The glass bottles are about the size of a penny. 2 of the bottles broke in the envelope. When I received the package today, microbeads were spilled all over the envelope. The bottles came wrapped in a clear plastic. No padding inside, No bubble wrap. The only thing that had a little bit of bubble wrap was the envelope. I ordered 2 sets.  So I was supposed to get 40. Unfortunately 2 bottles broke.Thank God I didn&#x27;t order 100 of these for my customers. Don&#x27;t waste your time, energy and money.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of time.</li>
    <li> So a few weeks ago I have received my order. I love and enjoy the different colors, styles and designs provided.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are cute, but the only problem is how small they turned out to be. The pictures showed them to look like a pretty decent size/amount. But when I opened my tiny little envelope and saw really tiny baby bottles- I was very unsatisfied. (I contacted the seller and I got my money refunded so these ended up being free for me).They do get really messy, I wish their was stick or something to help out with application. Overall I&#x27;m half satisfied due to the fact that it was free and that the colors are very cute, I didn&#x27;t get the black glitter so that was a bit upsetting. The size is as tine as a penny if not smaller! Over all I&#x27;m more happy than sad with my purchase. I do suggest you to purchase these little glitter bottles but just be aware that its very small and you might get upset at first but just embrace the cute colors provided.</li>
    <li> The little jars have lots of colors and shapes for your nail art designs, you will enjoy the creative possibilities.</li>
    <li> i just recieved this today, iwas so excited to see all the cute little stuff.  i can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I recieved 18 intact vials and 2broken. I hve at least 6 tht r tha same style its def not 20 diff styles. And tha vials r alot smaller than I expected but with the price I paid I think they r ok. Jus wish I would hve gtten 20 diff styles.</li>
    <li> so many ideas for decorating with these and then i can use the empty bottle for pendents.. im hoping to get more in the near future..</li>
    <li> Tiny glass bottles not in original packaging therefore i recieved a broken bottle in my package no labeling even showing fragile so very likely there will be broken bottles</li>
    <li> Love the colors just trying to get it back in the bottle is so hard had to find something else to put it in</li>
    <li> Took couple weeks for shipment but well wort the wait. If you like doing your own nails and nail art these are great to have. Only down fall,  I wish I bought the bigger bundle instead of just 20. But I will be buying more for sure. Very well packaged, the bottles are pretty full too. There are all different types of art. No two where alike.  And great price.&lt;br /&gt;I bought some at my local $1 store in sets of 6 but they where no where as nice as this set.</li>
    <li> I would have rated this a five for the very fast shipping and the great quality for so little money, but I only had 18 bottles when it clearly says 20.  Thats my only hangup but hey, I only spent a dollar so pretty awesome overall.</li>
    <li> very cute. I have 10 different types but with repeats. some 3 of same, some 2 of same. but I still like it and will use all of them. thank you. i&#x27;m satisfied with product</li>
    <li> I love sparkles on my nails, this looks like so much fun, can not wait for new nail designs, yay</li>
    <li> Love these!! Great value and love the tiny bottles!! So cute. I will be ordering more when I see they have more designs.</li>
    <li> Really fun effects to do with this product. Great colors.</li>
    <li> Good for fingernails.  But can also be bought at Dollar Tree stores.</li>
    <li> I did not like the size of this items.  They are so tiny.  I like the various colors, however I would not recommend because of the size.</li>
    <li> They arrived before expected date and they were exactly as described i got the amount they said  i would  and they were really cheap i got all kinds of shapes and colors i recommend.</li>
    <li> This was an introduction set for myself.. and I wouldn&#x27;t really consider it more than that. However, the price was right.</li>
    <li> 12yr old daughter tried these. Might stay on better with a few topcoats,  might use for crafts instead of nails.</li>
    <li> I did not get the ones in the picture like I expected but the ones I got were okay.</li>
    <li> Exactly as promised. The little viles aren&#x27;t very full though. Only about 1/3 full actually but they are fun and very cute. If they were full, they would have been given 5 stars because they are shown full in the pic.</li>
    <li> I love the actual product, but am very unsatisfied with the way it was shipped. The glass bottles were shipped and must have gotten smashed at some point, so five out of the 20 bottles are broken. I am trying to separate the glass from the nail art to salvage what I have, but I think that something could have been done to protect the product.</li>
    <li> Sent the wrong item and there were only 14, not 20!  Will not buy from China, must be a language barrier!</li>
    <li> These are so amazing and super cute in their little glass jars.  I use these to add an extra flair to my nails.</li>
    <li> not bad.  Not fantastic, a bit difficult to use but the items are pretty.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to someone with experience applying the things.  If you&#x27;re new at it like me, you might find it difficult as I did.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice! The size is good and it match with the descriptions of the product. Good price for the ítem.</li>
    <li> these things are so small, but theyre cute. You have to be careful with them because they are tiny and a small breeze can take them away. 3 of them arrived broken and spilled all throughout the package which pissed me off but they were ones that I didn&#x27;t like that much anyway so it was ok, but still, annoying. But overall a good buy.</li>
    <li> I love these things! And the little bottles I can reuse for other things. It did take a bit to get them in but was worth it. I read the reviews and saw where others were unhappy with the size, it clearly states *mini* in the description .</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get this product, and yes, compared to a drugstore or Sally&#x27;s Beauty I did save a lot of money.  Unfortunately, before I even received them in the mail I saw this exact product at every Dollar Tree in LA!  You can get multiple different types of glitter and tinsel and shapes in packs of 8 (obviously for a dollar.  I was sad and felt ripped off, but now I know better.  They also have nail polish pens.  The only things I haven&#x27;t been able to find there are rhinestones, nail tape, and the dotters.</li>
    <li> good varity cute designs  we love the color choices and the quality of the shapes and sizes are just right</li>
    <li> Super cute and just as described. I only got a few that had similar bottles. I can&#x27;t believe how great the price was!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my 14 year old sister who is into nails and stuff like that she love them they are all tiny but cute I&#x27;m pretty sure she is going to have a lot of fun. It also came in before time much  appreciate thanks. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more :)</li>
    <li> all of the items were adorable and in great condition. love using these and even finding cute ideas to use the little glass vials once theyre empty.</li>
    <li> They are so tiny and cute. Though they are very small they actually do hold alot in them. totally worth it</li>
    <li> These are excellent for people who love sparkles.  My niece will love them.  She is a girly girl.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money to buy!</li>
    <li> very small in size but, it works well I been going crazy doing my nail and changing them up all the time. thisi s awesome if you know what your doing and how o use them. Tanks Cynthia</li>
    <li> I received the product much earlier than expected. Bottles were almost 3/4 full and its a pretty decent product. But I think I would have to agree with other reviewers that the bottles are too small than expected. I got what I paid for and nothing more but overall its a decent product.</li>
    <li> This is cute, they come in these small bottles but they hold a decent amount. It&#x27;s a nice assortment of decals though I so wish they included more shapes/variety other than color. One of my bottles broke during transit but the rest were ok.</li>
    <li> Colors of beads are good but some seem better for a younger girl( yellow etc.)&lt;br /&gt;different shapes and sizes just as described.</li>
    <li> If you do nails for a living, on the side, or just for fun..... This mini glitter kit is FOR YOU! I love it. Not only was my order delivered on time but this is fun to use! there are several different types of glittler/mini glitter balls/ fun shapes (hearts,stars, moons,etc.) Plus if you use all your glittler the mini jars and BONOUS ! great for other crafts or necklaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Product and would recomend to anyone in the (Nail &#x27; Business&amp;#34; ).</li>
    <li> Great assortment of  20 mini beads, mini glitters I can&#x27;t wait to mix top coat and mini glitter on the tips to create fun designs with my Cheeky mini rhinestones. Definitely worth the money will buy again, just shake over a paper plate and put the over spill back into the tiny vials so you don&#x27;t waste any they are so cute.</li>
    <li> I love these tiny bottles. I as able to mix up a few new customized colors for my clients!! Would recommend! !</li>
    <li> I love them!  They came sooner than the shipping said so that always great!  All my bottle were full beside one was just half full but I can live with that!  Will be ordering again after I run out!</li>
    <li> All I received was 17 bottles of tiny beads an 3 bottles of regular glitter. You do NOT get the stars, hearts, flowers etc.</li>
    <li> I love the samples but I didn&#x27;t receive twenty bottles, I only received 19 bottles and I received two of the same colors. I left three stars earlier but that was not acceptable which is complete bull! If a paying customer didn&#x27;t receive as advertised then they should be able to post how many stars they want. So now heres four stars just to see if this will get posted so that other customers will know.</li>
    <li> A couple were missing...</li>
    <li> Cute wide variety of decorations to put on nails and small for the perfect fit. Works well with nail polish as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x60;ve got some doubles and not even 1 mini-jar  with STARS  or white/silver anything  so 1 minus star of review. :)</li>
    <li> The gems are lots of fun and perfect to display while they are waiting to be used. My daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> As the title states, I&#x27;m so happy with my Cheeky nail art set! I received it today, and everything came nicely packaged. I can&#x27;t wait to polish my nails, and use my nail art set from Cheeky. I will purchase more sets, and products from this brand. Awesome!</li>
    <li> They are soo cute! Love the assortment of colors. I&#x27;m very excited about starting nail art and practicing with this won&#x27;t brake the bank. The price was awesome!</li>
    <li> Very tiny, was not expecting it to be as little as it was. But I had no duplicates of designs and the ones I got were great and exactly what I wanted,</li>
    <li> Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product being that they came in adorable tiny bottles for each of the glitter sheets. However two of the bottles did break so I had to spend about 15 minutes to clean the bottles from one of the glitter bottles and caviar bottles that broke. Definitely worth $2.60 even though two broke!</li>
    <li> I love these cutie thingies they&#x27;re really nice and you will have a lot of fun with your kids, not use it only for nails you can use of  everything else!</li>
    <li> Great for the price paid.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0086LC49K 20 Types Nail Art Mini Glitter Sheets Acrylic Tips]]I received this item pretty quickly after ordering, expected to receive in late August. I have not used yet but I am pleased with the products. I have a variety of caviar hearts and other jewels, my granddaughters and I will have lots of fun with these and others items purchased from amazon.</li>
    <li> very small bottles that are glass.  Had one broken when I got it, so picking up all the tiny pieces was bad.  And pieces of glass all in it.  Designes are simple... stars hearts and a flower.  colors were doubled up.</li>
    <li> They have these at dollar tree for 1$ As well as other shapes and gems and they look like they&#x27;re the same size as these!</li>
    <li> Like the product great quality.They need to ensure the stoppers fit the bottles tightly to avoid the stoppers being pushed into the bottom of the bottles and to avoid glitter spills.</li>
    <li> great for nail art, I read the reviews and most said they didnt get a variety but one specific  kind of art but different colors..I ended up with a variety, so Im happy with that.</li>
    <li> The accents are adorable and very easy to use (I apply with a dotting tool or toothpick and seal on with clear coat), however the user images had me a bit disappointed when they arrived all sealed loosely in a small plastic bag like something from the flea market. Thankfully none had come open or broke and everything was in tacked - so I&#x27;m not sure where those shown with the bottles in a hard plastic packaging ordered from, but it was different than where I obviously had. (Those I received are also all different than any of those pictured, so selection seems to be random?) But for just about $3.00 U.S (where/when I purchased) for 20 different little accents (and glass bottles that can be used in other crafts) I&#x27;m rather happy with my order and will certainly purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> You get a wide assortment and variety out of these 20 containers.&lt;br /&gt;And the containers themselves are cool.&lt;br /&gt;Beautifully colored and strong quality make nail application process easy and fun.&lt;br /&gt;The price for what you get can not be beat!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m am gonna place another order ,as I see from customer pictures ,there are some I haven&#x27;t gotten yet.</li>
    <li> It was 20 bottles but it was only 7 different types of designs. I like what I got but will probably not use as many stars as was sent</li>
    <li> well.. the package came late and, two bottles were broken and now there are little pieces all over my table. I had no duplicates but the containers are very small, you can only use them twice, if that. I wont be buying again but, for what I did receive it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the little jars they came in! They are perfect to see what kind of nail art you want to use on your nails.</li>
    <li> I like the nail art mini glitter sheets tips it&#x27;s very nice and it looks really cute</li>
    <li> The packaging was good, didn&#x27;t have any spills and they were all full. Fast delivery which is always a plus. I would buy more. (Also the small (tiny) containers are glass and reusable.)</li>
    <li> its okay, not good for the price, bottles are tiny as a nail</li>
    <li> I picked up these EXACT same things at my local Dollar Tree recently. Im serious, same exact thing. Same tiny bottles, same glitters. Its not worth the money, they are difficult to use, and come off easily.</li>
    <li> In the picture you show a good selection of glitters and shapes.... well, I received so many duplicates that I wouldn&#x27;t use them in my whole lifetime. If your not going to send a good selection, then please take down the misleading photo and update your description</li>
    <li> they come in these little glass jars! super cute, and re-usable! (sadly my niece dropped them and two broke :/ ) they are perfect on nails!</li>
    <li> All kinds of styles to help you get the nail art you want to achieve; create multiple looks with a little time and small effort.  Would recommend to anyone that wants to get a new look that will get attention</li>
    <li> The cutest things ever...All 20 were different :) I have absolutely no complaints about my purchase...Thank you! Happy Happy Happy</li>
    <li> Really nice combination and colos.. Love it. Deliver fast. Really helpfull I recommend it to use. All diferent shapes fot your nail.</li>
    <li> Not sure why these are called glitter &amp;#34;sheets&amp;#34; since they come in tiny bottles - but anyway, they are a bargain and worth the time you wait for them to be delivered.  They have 20 different glitter types, sure to meet a person&#x27;s glitter needs for their nail bling.</li>
    <li> The product came in as expected, but I didn&#x27;t like how I had some repeats and I had 3 types of yellow and 3 orange but no pink or blue colors which are my favorite. Anyways they still look cute.</li>
    <li> two of them came broken on my package :(, other than that they are very pretty and compliment my nails.!!</li>
    <li> Each bottle is like a one time deal, I was not impressed by how much you have to use of it and then it didn&#x27;t stay on my Neils hardly at all it will take brushed off is I used it</li>
    <li> Lots of fun! Real glass jars. Some designs are repetitive. Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
    <li> So cute! People say stuff was falling out, not true with mine. I love the amount and variety they give you, just enough to see what works for you.</li>
    <li> Of the 20 types of nail art, several aren&#x27;t even glitter sheets--they&#x27;re small round balls.  They&#x27;re cute, but the color comes off in clear coat, so I probably won&#x27;t use those much for nail art.  I&#x27;m still happy with the other pieces though; they&#x27;re adorable and each design comes in soooo many colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the purchase--it was cheap as hell, especially compared to store prices.</li>
    <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.</li>
    <li> Came in early and so so cute I was so excited for these ! The brand and seller are ALWAYS on the ball . All my bottles are full and no duplicates of colors . Absolutely perfect and the small little bottles are perfect for small trinket necklaces when they&#x27;re empty ! I love I love I love !!!</li>
    <li> BOUGHT THEM FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER.  SHE THANKED ME, AND TOLD ME SHE LIKED THEM.&lt;br /&gt;IT TOOK LONGER THAN USUAL TO GET THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SHIPPED FROM JAPAN.</li>
    <li> Product is just what I wanted. A great value.</li>
    <li> Super cute but NONE of them stayed on my nails, they don&#x27;t curve to hug the nails. They&#x27;re super stiff in shape and don&#x27;t stick on nails unless you glue them on. Thought I could just glide some top coat over them but nah.</li>
    <li> WARNING PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING THESE !! So I Just got these in the mail today (12 days before the estimate delivery date so that&#x27;s a plus!) and I have to say they are pretty cute and amazing but the only reason I removed a star is that the bottles are REALLY TINY! Other then that I&#x27;m fine with it overall, nothing came broken and the bottles were filled to the top.</li>
    <li> i think theese little bottles are so neat and they are not hard to use definatley gonna buy more next time</li>
    <li> Their little package is cute!! I cannot wait to use them on my nails!!!! Shipped incredibly fast too! :)</li>
    <li> Great for the price. Even though this is not the best material it is perfect for the amount you pay to get it.</li>
    <li> Yes, the bottles are super small, but alot of hearts fit in that tiny bottle. I got a variety of hearts, glitter and caviar.</li>
    <li> I love these nail art mini sheets I use them when I make my own glitter nail polish</li>
    <li> Thanks for sending me a new one again, I appreciate it very much! I love all the different types of glitter sheets...so cute! Thanks again!</li>
    <li> I purchase a couple 8pks of these from my local dollar store for a buck a pack. I really loved the caviar beads, but the crushed shells were a bit too transparent. I would definitely purchases these again...just not the crushed shells.</li>
    <li> I love these. A great selection of shapes and colors.Has just about everything you want and the perfect size and amount</li>
    <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
    <li> I love my glitters. I use them for resin pieces and they make my pieces really pop.</li>
    <li> I received 17 bottles of beads and 2 bottles of glitter stars and1 bottle of glittered hearts. Most of my beads were the same color. It wasn&#x27;t anything like I thought I was ordering.</li>
    <li> Items arrived unbroken. Exactly what I ordered and expected. There are a lot of different uses for these items. I purchased these to with craft projects and they are perfect.  A variety of shapes, styles and colors. Very satisfied</li>
    <li> I just received these and boy are they tiny! For some reason I thought they were going to be foil sheets but I love doing nails and I will use them. They were all full and no broken ones. Look forward to the different designs I can create with them.</li>
    <li> These little pieces are great!  Have not put them on nails, but, rather an art project.  Thinking outside the box on this one, 2nd time purchased.  The tiny bottles they come in can also be re-purposed!</li>
    <li> These are tiny little bottles but are very cute. I gave away nail kits for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party and this was a nice (and cheap!) addition to the good bags. Also, since they are so small I am not worried about the mass destruction sometimes made during play- easy to clean up.</li>
    <li> They are definitely are worth the price because it&#x27;s so cheap. They are so small. I still haven&#x27;t used mine only because I want to use them for a special occasion but they came quick and all intact so major plus!</li>
    <li> I loved the colors! the quality is great and the bottles are generously filled up!&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;and I would def recommend this item!</li>
    <li> I finally got mine...it took a long time!!! Every tiny (really tiny) bottle wams opens and mixed up!!! What the freak??? Regrets buying this micro messy crap!</li>
    <li> Amazing for the price</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but was pleasantly surprised.  Everything came in small glass bottles like the picture so I&#x27;ll be able to reuse them. The bottles were full and the quality of the product itself is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was also delivered much quicker than the estimated date.</li>
    <li> The procuct was as described it the discription. The bottles are small but that was also stated.  It arrived as expected. Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Looked bigger in the picture but on the other hand nice pieces great for my nails love the hearts &amp; glitter there awesome</li>
    <li> I love doing my nails and getting this nail supply make it better both at home n in the nail salon. I love them and also they look cool to.</li>
    <li> The cutest things ever .. All 20 were different :) I had absolutely no complaints about my purchase. Thank you</li>
    <li> Was expecting all to be different and got alot of the same colors and shapes.But for the price I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Items are exactly as described, shipping took forever!</li>
    <li> I was expecting 20 different types of things . Instead I got 20 bottles of 3 different types of tiny nail art things</li>
    <li> Received these today along with my nail tape and my daughter&#x27;s already asking when can I do her nails. They&#x27;re very pretty. I had no problems with the packaging, they weren&#x27;t spilled inside the bag they came in and nothing was missing. Overall I am very pleased and would order from this seller again :-)</li>
    <li> Nice glitter for nails.  When we have quiet days, my girls and I do our nails, so I purchase this set of glitter and the girls just love how their nails look!</li>
    <li> Just OK. . lots of little stuff</li>
    <li> I bought these glitter bottles for use in resin jewelry and they look very pretty! I also use them on my nails from time to time. :D Great purchase! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love these I will be purchaseing more of this item in the future I love using these nail arts. I use them fo rmy resin.</li>
    <li> I like these nail decorations a lot. The package gave me enough variety to try different types of things that I&#x27;ve been wanting to attempt (caviar beads, hand placed glitter).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the packages are all random I didn&#x27;t get a single repeat of shape and color. I ordered from the seller Cheeky Beauty/Hongnuo nail supplies factory and it came packaged in Cheeky brand packaging so I&#x27;m not sure if the many reviewers claiming they got repeats ordered from another seller and perhaps the vials came un-packaged?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve uploaded a photo of what I received to Imgur if this helps anyone. [...] Even though the designs and colors are ultimately random this should give you a good idea. For under three dollars even if you only like and use half of the designs it&#x27;s still a good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For added fun here is a manicure I did this week using some of the star shapes and loose glitter pieces from this set: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I forgot that Amazon does not like external links and has removed them from my review. Shame because I think in this case they&#x27;d be.really helpful. Really guys, for 3 dollars you can&#x27;t complain much about a random assortment.</li>
    <li> This is a Fun set for girls days it is a nice touch to my nail art supplies. I would order again.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually used this yet, but looks like it will be great for a little something extra for nails.  Looks nice.</li>
    <li> Tiny containers with a lot of different kinds of decorative materials.  If you&#x27;re looking to try something out, great, this probably is the product for you.  Stars, hearts, glitters and microbeads - 20 different designs and textures to choose from.  If you&#x27;re looking to do a lot, don&#x27;t bother.  Each vial is just bigger than a nickel and isn&#x27;t exactly full to the brim.  Good for the price though; no regrets.</li>
    <li> this was kinda sticky &amp; didnt work the greatest</li>
    <li> i just got these yesterday. i only received the sequin shape type, none of the caviar balls, but i am ok with that.  i have a rainbow of hearts and stars for my nails.  they do stick up a bit from the nail, which is not something i am used to, but i think i can adapt. the jars they come in are adorable and i plan on using them for crafts after i am done with the nail sequins.</li>
    <li> They are just ok! Their cute and you get a really good variety of decals to use, but it is a little hard to make them saty on. Maybe I should use a better top coat.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy these. There is no product. Unless none they plan to send out. Save your time and energy and don&#x27;t buy from here.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughters for Christmas and the quality is great and I&#x27;m positive they will have a great time with their friends on kids nights with these!;)</li>
    <li> Arrived early. Well packed, love the different variety of colors and designs, only thing is is pretty small but I think it bring sufficient for me, I would recommend this product only if you are not going to use much of it.</li>
    <li> Really pleased with these. Very small, but as expected. Filled the little bottles completely up at least! Didn&#x27;t get any doubles and not to much of the same kind. A very nice variety, although I wished I got some designs like the star ones I saw. I got glitter, flakes, and the little tiny pearl looking ones. I&#x27;d definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for nail designs with acrylic i have not used them other than with acrylic but i&#x27;m sure they would still work and look great.</li>
    <li> These were so much fun to receive, when I opened the package they were all in the cute little vials all neat and organized. I love using them, so many colors to choose from. no problem with delivery.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I thought they containers would be bigger but I am happy with the purchase. These will make some really cute nail art designs.</li>
    <li> I love these to put on my nails under the acrylic. I did get two different dupes, 2 green hearts and 2 blue stars. I wish they were all different but what can you do, the price is worth it. All the bottles are filled at different levels. They do take about a month to get here so order them way in advance...</li>
    <li> I received the package two weeks after I ordered it which was still before the estimated date of delivery. All twenty jars were there (they are adorably tiny) and seem full to me. There were many repeats though I don&#x27;t mind besides the fact that so many were pink (my least favorite color). I received five glitters (one yellow, one red, two white, and one gold), nine beads (two pink, one hot pink, one purple, one red, one black, one white/silver, and two turquoise), four hearts (one pink, one gold, and two light green), and two stars (pink and gold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not bad - super cheap. It would have been much cooler without duplicates but what do you expect for the price. If you&#x27;re looking for something specific in the pictures maybe ordering multiples would be a good idea for you. I&#x27;m definitely not disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are super adorable, and come with so many different glitters. They are adorable little jars packed with wonderful different shapes and glitters for your nails.</li>
    <li> Mines did not come in those jars!</li>
    <li> Came in the mail in a timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;5 beads&lt;br /&gt;  1 silver&lt;br /&gt;  1 clear&lt;br /&gt;  1 light pink&lt;br /&gt;  1 dark pink&lt;br /&gt;  1 gold&lt;br /&gt;3 flowers&lt;br /&gt;  2 peach&lt;br /&gt;  1 light blue&lt;br /&gt;1 hollow star&lt;br /&gt;  1 light blue&lt;br /&gt;1 solid star&lt;br /&gt;  1 white&lt;br /&gt;3 hearts&lt;br /&gt;  1 orange&lt;br /&gt;  1 gold / brown&lt;br /&gt;  1 light green&lt;br /&gt;2 pixie dust&lt;br /&gt;  1 pink&lt;br /&gt;  1 light blue&lt;br /&gt;5 glitter&lt;br /&gt;  1 yellow&lt;br /&gt;  1 red&lt;br /&gt;  1 hot pink&lt;br /&gt;  1 green&lt;br /&gt;  1 blue</li>
    <li> Got some doubles also some came broken. Not that bad tho.</li>
    <li> They are super tiny and it says 20 types and i got 5 types in 4 different colors. the bottle is a big as a nickel and about as big around as my 2 year old&#x27;s finger. it was not worth the money i spent on it! yes it arrived before time but this is NOT the product i wanted! it is not worth the money!</li>
    <li> Nice item, just as described</li>
    <li> Hi My name is Barbara One of my bottles was broke I mite still by more I will not be sending it back that is more money to do that. keep what got and lost money on it  that you</li>
    <li> Came with different ones for each and was neatly packed. More of a one to three uses out of it. Extremely tiny but good for the price. Bottles are usable.</li>
    <li> When these arrived at my house, I was so excited to get started...but when I opened the package, about half of the product was not in their containers! My wonderful daughter put all of the pieces back to their perspective places, and when I went to store them with all my other nail products, the lids came off yet again. So, I ended up loosing about half of the product due to the containers they were put in.</li>
    <li> I loved this!! They were packaged neatly and I got them just two weeks after they shipped which isn&#x27;t common when you order from overseas. I got a good selection in various colors and would order these again. The only reason that I do not give all five stars is a dislike not being able to track my items though I don&#x27;t think the  suppler could help with that. These went onto bracelets as charms but I would use them in my nail art as well.</li>
    <li> These took some time to ship but overall happy with the product and ready to play with some nail art.</li>
    <li> I love these! As I&#x27;ve mentioned in other reviews, I&#x27;ve recently developed an interest in all things nail art related. Coming up with new ways to express myself via my nails in an otherwise boring office environment has been fun. These stones have been great for making new designs pop ranging from ladybugs to leopard prints. They&#x27;ve been great fun - all I do is add a dab of clear polish, use tweezers to apply the stones, and let it dry...afterwords, another topcoat, and I&#x27;m good to go! They usually last as long as I can stand my manicure, and remove easily with polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, at the price, they&#x27;re a great value for anyone&#x27;s makeup kit.</li>
    <li> It took a long time to arrive, and it was not the best product as shown in pic... anyways, Thanks for sending it at least.</li>
    <li> the jars were really tiny but there were 20 and I didnt really spend much. I love all of the different little things it came with and like that i can re-use the little jars when they are empty for whatever I want.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to find these. I was going to order several (daughters, their pals, etc) but thought I&#x27;d try one first. I&#x27;m glad I did!  I figured there might be a some repeat glitters or colors and was okay with that but what I go was 17 tubes of micro beads, 2 hollow stars, and 1 fine glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the seller because I was a little disappointed - I could have just bought micro beads if I&#x27;d wanted only micro beads - and sent a picture. The description states that you&#x27;ll receive a variety of glitter. They told me that they felt that since the micro beads were (mostly) different colors that that was variety enough. They were nice about it, offered a partial refund, etc. At that point it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been hoping to hear that it was a fluke (I didn&#x27;t) and would have happily ordered again if that were the case (doesn&#x27;t seem to be?).  They&#x27;re not overly expensive or anything but I&#x27;d rather not throw money down the drain at all.</li>
    <li> The bottles are so tiny and can&#x27;t be used more than once. Some of the colors are not what I would have chosen (I actually ended up w/ 6 various shades of blue, 6 of gold or yellow, and 4 of whites so, the only color I ended up w/ are the 4 bottles that are left) For the price though, it&#x27;s much cheaper that you would pay elsewhere so, it&#x27;s worth the price for a little sparkle and various designs!</li>
    <li> I was excited to get  these and I was a little disappointed that I got a lot of the same thing. I ended up with 24 bottles in mine  which was awesome but I got 3 or 4 bottles of the same thing so I only ended up with  about 5 different colors and types . But I did do my nails  with them and I am happy  with the end result.</li>
    <li> I received 20 bottles of various nail art bits and bobs. They all seem to be a good size to put on your nails. There is nail caviar and stars and glitter and some other cute things. Lots of great colors too. When I use all the product I also have these super cute bottles to reuse for other arts and crafts!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but messy but still good</li>
    <li> I really like this glitter and I knew it would be small obviously it says  &#x27;Mini Glitter&#x27; and it only filled up half way, some less. Other than that its worth the price I guess</li>
    <li> this was a bad investment all my bottles contained micro beads not assortment like what was shown in the picture,very disappointing will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I am now so happy with this product. When I first received the order I only had glitters, imagine that 40 glitters, it was too much.  I contacted the company and they assured me they would ship me out some shapes to fix the mistake.  I have finally received them and am very happy with the variety and different shapes.  I am happy to add these to my nail art collection which is growing by leaps and bounds because of Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> great item love the colors I recommend this  when I got it 1 bottle was broken</li>
    <li> Cute although a few were broke. Cute addition to my kit</li>
    <li> i got these the other day and i have used on some of my customers and they love them .. lots of pretty colors and different things  .. they are really cute</li>
    <li> Love nail art. Very nice variety. Love the tiny little containers the nail art is in too. Very Happy!</li>
