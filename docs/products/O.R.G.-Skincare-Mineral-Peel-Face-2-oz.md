<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my all time favorite product.  My face feels so clean and soft without being harsh.  I am not sure how to live without it.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll start out by telling you I have very, very sensitive skin. I generally don&#x27;t like trying new things on it, but I heard about this brand from a friend and I wanted to try it. Aside from the fact that it&#x27;s slightly gross to rub off one&#x27;s own skin, it needs to be done. I use both the body and face exfoliator about three times a week. It makes me feel so clean, my skin is insanely soft after I rinse with warm water, and my skin reacts fine to it! I&#x27;m officially hooked on this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  I have tried so many products and this one is by far the best.  I can see the dead skin just coming off my face.  I have told all my friends about this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the product. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a lot more. The product doesn&#x27;t exfoliate at all. The &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; people think they see is actually created by heat from your finger tips, friction, and the product itself. Try spraying it one plastic wrap and you get the same result. I was so bummed out I was really hoping it would work, but it&#x27;s just a trick. Kind a like the people in the mall kiosks that put conditioner in the water the wash your hand with so you think their cream made your hand feel softer 😔</li>
    <li> Really works, exceeded my expectations. Good buy!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff for exfoliation! Skin will literally roll off, and it does not irritate my skin in the slightest. It is surprising at how much this stuff takes off. For me, I have found it is best to wet and pat dry the skin real quick, then I spray onto my hand and lightly rub on the area I want to exfoliate. I found if I sprayed and let sit for a few seconds on dry skin then it seemed to dry, and I&#x27;d waste some of it. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I love it. it removes my dry or dead skin and leaves a soft baby touch feeling. it seems to help avoid breakouts.</li>
    <li> This product seems a bit pricey especially if you may not like it. Let me say that it delivers! I am very please with the amount of dead skin cells that gently slough off every time I use this.</li>
    <li> Great product!! I&#x27;ve tried many face products as my skin is sensitive and acne prone, but this product definitely is amazing. It deep cleans and does not irritate my skin. After my first use, I noticed the affect it has on blemishes as I started using it one night that I had a pimple and the pimple seemed to have disappeared by the next morning! I know it seems pricey but I think it&#x27;s well worth it as it works!!</li>
    <li> product is so gentle yet so powerful in getting dead skin cells off my skin. Quite pricey for a bottle, but it was worth it.</li>
    <li> I give it five stars cause it does exactly what it says. It&#x27;s not harsh on your skin like most face peels. I have been using it for a month now and my face have become softer and dark spots are definitely going away. Also it is great for before you put on makeup and after to make sure it&#x27;s all gone with you take it off</li>
    <li> You just spray on dry skin and you can tell it&#x27;s working ... instantly.  It brightens and smooths your complexion.  Crazy!  I like how it leaves a very smooth canvas for makeup application without making my skin red or irritated.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product with absolutely no irritation to my sensitive skin. I use it about 3 times a week, and it makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its working or not. I don&#x27;t think it was worth what I paid and although you do see the stuff flake up on your skin but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements since I&#x27;ve been using it. I&#x27;ll finish the entire bottle and update my review.</li>
    <li> It is an effective fast but gentle exfoliant that my skin can take everyday! I love it and I work in the professional spa industry.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot! It&#x27;s a little difficult to use. The consistency of the product is like water and drips off my face before I can start scrubbing. Though it does remove a lot of the dead skin on my face and no irritation.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best thing ever! First of all it&#x27;s organic. Secondly, you just shake the bottle, spritz it directly on your face for four seconds and then watch as old skin and dirt/gunk is wiped out of your pores! It&#x27;s not only fun (and a little gross to see what was on your face) but my skin is gloriously smooth afterward. I use it twice a week, but it is extremely gentle. It&#x27;s a perfect &#x27;instant gratification&#x27; product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have a few wrinkles around the eyes and mouth.  We have talked to our dermatologist about using a product like this.  They could do it for us for a considerably higher cost than this product cost.  We are both happy with how the product feels on our skin.  We are both very pale skinned and neither of get red or sore.  The skin rolls off and leaves the skin feeling very soft.  We use it once or twice a week and we have both seen a visible improvement in  the wrinkles.  My husband has an area of skin around this  throat which has a crepe appearance which since using this product has drastically improved.  We are both very happy with this.  Don&#x27;t waste your money at spas etc. try this at home.</li>
    <li> Really like this. It makes my skin feel so much softer.  I use it every other day or so before my night serums.  The first time I used it, a really gross amount of skin came off - I tend to have dry skin.  Now it&#x27;s less so but still makes a difference.  When i wake up in the morning, I can tell the nights that I used it.  You give spray a section of your face (3 or 4 sprays), wait 5 seconds, then wipe off in a circular motion with your hand.  You can feel the skin beading up.  Then just wipe off with a wet wash cloth.  I bought it for my mom as well and she loves it too!</li>
    <li> this product delivers exactly what it says it will. me and my friend tried it out tonight for the first time, tons of dead skin came off immediately. it is very gentle but you can tell it is working by just the mildest tingle and just TONS of dead skin. my moisturizer that i applied afterwards just absorbed so well!! just  your skin will look positively radiant, shining, supple, smooth. i can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after using it for a couple of weeks. in one use my pores were clean and smaller, my friends sun spots were visibly diminished immediately. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! it does come in a glass bottle but it also came in a protective cardboard tube so i don&#x27;t think that will be a problem. it has a very nice clean scent, rinses off very nicely with warm water. i bought the body peel as well and it is also an excellent product. highly recommend them to anyone! very easy to use, just spray it on, wait 3 seconds and rub in with your fingertips or soft cloth or cotton pad, rinse off with water and you are done. i have paid a lot more for lots of products that were a lot harder to use and did not work nearly as well. i am so glad i found this!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product very frequently, but whenever I used it I didn&#x27;t feel any change on my skin.  I see better result with home made peeling combinations than this product with such expensive price. It also make my skin feels a little bit dry. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it to my friends.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t see too much of anything from it yet. Maybe a slight improvement.i will give it a good attempt  to see if it really works.</li>
    <li> Very mild and gentle. It&#x27;s amazing, you can literally see the dead skin on your face. It also leaves your face feeling super soft and clean. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have only recently started using it and my skin already feels great. I wish I had known about this product a lot earlier.</li>
    <li> makes my face soft but I wasn&#x27;t completely impressed. I agree with another reviewer i saw on here. I can&#x27;t tell if its really dead skin coming off or the spray drying and rubbing off in clumps. I notice if I spray more on my face then i should (by accident) i rub and nothing happens. Its only when i spray barely enough where it kinda dries when I see the &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34;. I only gave it a 3 because its organic.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Really works and I can tell a real difference in my skin! I have really sensitive skin and I have yet to see a break out from usage. I would recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> - This product seemingly didn&#x27;t work for me the first time I tried it, but it felt gentle and smelled nice so I gave it another shot a few days later. Second time was the charm, it started releasing dead skin everywhere. Try giving it 5-6 seconds and really rub in with your fingertips for a minute to work it through that first layer, or try an area where you don&#x27;t regularly exfoliate, like your chest or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There&#x27;s really no question that what you&#x27;re rolling away are your own dead skin bits, unless you&#x27;ve never manually exfoliated a healing/peeling sunburn in the shower. Only thing I can guess is the product didn&#x27;t work when the 1 star reviewer tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After working all the dead junk up with your fingers, a warm damp washcloth gets everything off, a cold splash and your favorite facial moisturizer makes your skin feel fantastic. I exfoliate with an almond shell scrub every day and this stuff got a lot that I was apparently still missing, without irritating my skin through overuse of harsh friction. Think of it like a high quality soft polishing finish for your face.</li>
    <li> This really works!  Read about it in one of my magazines and thought it worth a try and it is.  When you do not have a lot of time to spend on facial, this is the solution.</li>
    <li> Review Edited 3/13/2015 The price on the product has pretty much doubled since I originally began purchasing it.  At first I thought perhaps it was just a glitch here on amazon, so I decided to head on over to the manufacture&#x27;s website and check things out there.  Major bummer—turns out they really have bumped the price to almost double what they originally charged.  Once you add shipping in, it&#x27;s literally double.  This definitely takes some of the shine off this product for me.  You had such a great thing going here, O.R.G.  An amazing product at a really doable price point.  Now, at almost $50 bucks a bottle, when a bottle doesn&#x27;t last me a month, it feels a little too pricey.  Original Review Holy skin cells everywhere, Batman!  This stuff is amazing.  For the last two years I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne, seeing dermatologists and spending just a stupid amount of money on prescription medications, creams, masques, and spa treatments.  Alas, it was all to no avail.  But two months ago, after reading some reviews on various exfoliants, I decided to give O.R.G. Mineral Peel Face a try.  Since then, I&#x27;ve experienced overall better skin tone, with a *greatly* reduced occurrence of breakouts (I&#x27;m talking one or two blemishes a month) and the pores on and around my nose have shrank down so much as to have become nearly invisible (and let me tell you—they were more than visible before).  I seriously love this stuff, and am hooked for life.  I use it pretty frequently, on average every other to every day, depending on how quickly my skin starts to become dull-looking.</li>
    <li> This product works very well if you have a lot of stubborn dead dry skin. My face was so dry for a while and I noticed that it would start to peel after a while so I invested in an intensive moisturizer and the O.R.G. Skincare mineral peel. OMG!!! This is one of the greatest products I have ever discovered it helps to exfoliate the dead skin right off your face. So easy and it works so well. I&#x27;m so glad I made this investment towards my skin. My results are phenomenal!!</li>
    <li> This works just as described.  It&#x27;s very gentle, but a great exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I have dry flaky patches of skin on my face and this product helps exfoliate so that my face make up can go on smoothly. The bottle should last a while for normal skin but I use it almost everyday and sometimes I have to use it twice in a row when my skin is extra dry so it doesn&#x27;t last me as long as it should. However, it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days and can already see a difference.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This product rocks!  I saw this product on IG and had to order it right away.  I used to use another type of gel exfoliator that worked the same way but the store I used to buy it at, closed down.  Since I am trying to use &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; products nowadays, I got excited when I saw this!  You spray it on your face and gently rub around in circles and you can literally see your dried skin rub off slowly.  It&#x27;s nasty and pretty cool at the same time!  I would definitely recommend this  and would definitely order again!  It&#x27;s double the price on the direct website.</li>
    <li> Loves it my skin glowed &amp; felt smooth after using it</li>
    <li> This is a great product (I have used before) but it came in poor packaging.  I bought this product to give as gifts and it came packaged up with shipping tape and will not look nice when presented as a gift.  I am disappointed in this but do know the product will be nice.</li>
    <li> Did not use it much as I did not like the way this product dries on the skin.</li>
    <li> I am a professional make up artist and I use this first on my clients before we start the make up.  So gentle but works great. Leaves your skin feeling amazing and soft. I personally have sensitive skin and this does nothing but remove the dead skin on the top layer with zero irritation. So I feel that I can use it on anyone for a flawless makeup application. Definitely worth every penny because a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This product leave your skin fresh and smooth. Its nice and easy to do yourself instead for spending alot of money and time in the salon  for a facial</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Recommend to everyone. Just used it for three days and it makes a big difference.</li>
    <li> this stuff is gentle but works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best!  SO fast and simple, yet using it 2-3 times a week is giving me skin like I haven&#x27;t had for a long time. Usually it takes a facial to look this smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just turned 50 and have very sensitive, rosacea prone skin.  This has not caused me ANY irritation.  It literally takes about 2 minutes to do my entire face.  I also use it on my decollete area and have seen a lot of improvement there as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to NEVER be without this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried most peeling gel/cleanser/exfoliator out there, and this is one of the best. It&#x27;s simple, yet does its job. You don&#x27;t have to scrub your face like most of the other products on the market, and your face won&#x27;t turn red and irritated afterwards. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Works wonders for removing dead skin, I&#x27;ve noticed fading in acne scars after using about a month.</li>
    <li> This was just OK, I normally use 2 minute miracle gel, but after seeing the glowing reviews for this I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It does work (basically the same as miracle gel), my only issue is the spray top. I can&#x27;t just spray my face (my eyes don&#x27;t need exfoliating), so application became an issue.&lt;br /&gt;However if you love this line then I can recommend this as an exfoliator - it does do what it claims to do.</li>
    <li> It did not exfoliate as it said it would. I  couldn&#x27;t tell any deference in the appearance or feel of my skin.  I would not reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Rediced my scarring in a week. Wonderful wonderful stuff!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this products. It&#x27;s so easy to use. I use it on my lips and under my eyes too, of course when I use this under my eyes I spray it on my fingers then lightly rub on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and reactive skin. This facial peel did not sting, irritate, or burn. I received so many compliments on my skin after just two uses. This will be a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
    <li> I find it impossible to believe the one negative review on the product. The reviewer said that it didn&#x27;t exfoliate at all. I wonder if they used it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used this product for the first time. I sprayed it onto my face and neck, waited 3 seconds and used my fingers to massage it into my skin. The second that I touched my face, I felt dry old skin coming off. As someone who exfoliates daily (I use Origins Modern Friction, which is great for my sensitive skin). I am shocked by how smooth my skin feels. I am now left to wonder about my exfoliating routine</li>
    <li> This product is great! I have acne scars that I&#x27;ve been trying to diminish and after one use I see my skin clearing up.</li>
    <li> Good product, works as described, helps remove all the dead skin,&lt;br /&gt;and my face feels smoother after using.</li>
    <li> Excellent, recommend widely</li>
    <li> Skincare mineral peel really gets rid of the dead skin on my face and reduces my pores.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if it worked or not.  I&#x27;m like, what&#x27;s coming off on my face?  I have no clue.  My face feels smoother afterwards but I didn&#x27;t think the results lasted long.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Love, love it. Best mineral peel on the market.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I was looking for a non aggressive yet effective peel. The previous reviews gave me the courage to finally purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some acne on me cheeks and I was hoping this could help with acne marks and black heads. After the first time I used it I could feel my skin smoother and more radiant. It took me a couple of weeks to feel bigger changes in my skin. I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray applicator is great to use just the needed amount of product. It will last you a long time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use this product anymore as I believe I may be allergic to the product. I wasn&#x27;t happy with it, I expected better results.</li>
    <li> Changing my previous review score b/c I placed my new order on September 1, 2015.  Today is September 9th and my order, which I have been charged for, hasn&#x27;t even shipped.  I have emailed Amazon twice to find out why, but have yet to get a reply.  Really unhappy w/ their customer service, or lack of!    Previous review on product: This does an amazing job of getting off that gross dead skin.  Winter is especially harsh on my face and I peel (rosacea) with the lack of humidity.  I used it 2-3 times the first week, once a week after that and am now just to a maintenance.  My face doesn&#x27;t peel or flake like it had before using.  I purchased a much more expensive brand w/ a two step process and returned it b/c it didn&#x27;t even come close to doing what this product does.  For the price it is unbeatable!  So happy that I found this and it&#x27;s organic which makes me happier :)  AND my teenage daughter loves it as well!</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  Feels like you&#x27;ve had a facial every time you use!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still not convinced that my skin is peeling..It appears that the mist is drying into chunks when I rub it. I will continue for a couple of weeks and see if I notice any spots fading or a difference in my skin texture.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t what it says it is. This is NOT peeling the actual skin. Rather, the debris you see rubbing off is you rubbing the balling-up product off of your skin as it&#x27;s drying. You&#x27;re rubbing off the PRODUCT, not the skin. Skin does NOT peel off due to a simple spray of mostly water and light circular rubbing - it takes true exfoliation via a physical agent (ie, micro-crystals, dermabrasion or similar) or a chemical agent such as a stronger peel (glycolic, lactic, salicylic etc). This product is a scam, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few days so I&#x27;ve only gotten to use it twice however I like what I&#x27;m seeing so far. As soon as I spray it on my skin feels cool and the junk balls right up. It leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh. My favorite part is the smell though. Very clean and fresh smelling. I love it. I haven&#x27;t seen a change in my skin yet but I&#x27;ve only used it twice and my skin is pretty bad. Based on what I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;m confident it will get my skin in perfect condition in no time.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING MY SKIN LOOKS BETTER AFTER THE FIRST USE AND IT CONTINUES TO BRIGHTEN MY SKIN SO GENTLE AND OLD SKIN PEELS AWAY LIKE CRAZY. GLAD I BOUGHT TWO!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It really does feel like a mini peel done in less than a minute. The only reason I have given it only 4/5 stars is that it left parts of my face (cheeks, nose) cleaner and more refreshed than others (forehead and chin), which I found slightly disappointing</li>
    <li> When I received my package a lot of the product had spilled in the package and there was No seal on the product. A large portion of the product spilled in the package.</li>
    <li> Gentle and it does the job.  My skin feels fresh and revitalized after use. Was a great price.  Tried it based on other reviews and was not disappointed. Tnis is my 3rd order</li>
    <li> Amazing! I did a lot of research on this product before ordering it.  Love that it&#x27;s all natural and not harsh,  works great with my sensitive skin and the dry/dead skin came off so easily!  A d yes,  it is dead skin,  not product like one review stated.  After 1 week of daily use,  I no longer had dry,  flaky skin and my makeup goes on smooth.  Will definitely keep ordering!</li>
    <li> Does not do what it claims.  It just drys on your skin and balls up when you rub it off.  Doesn&#x27;t really do anything.</li>
    <li> I have only used this one time so far and it did even out the texture of my skin and the roughness went away. I also used in on the tops of my hands which have also been dry and rough due to the winter- hands are nice and soft now!&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that there are tiny particles of the product that I cannot get off of my jawline. It&#x27;s almost as if it is stuck to the tiny, fine hairs (and I&#x27;m not hairy- I didn&#x27;t even realize I had any hair there!).</li>
    <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This spray DEFINITELY gets rid of dead skin. When you rub your face, it just comes up like using an asian exfoliating pad. You see the same kinds of results but just from your hands and much much less effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for two weeks now and my skin is definitely improving. My acne is going away faster and I am very happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One down side is that I should have read it more carefully as it helps exfoliate rather than a peel. After reading the ingredients and the description, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily help your skin with its turnover rate like glycolic acid peels or lactic acid peels.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of skincare/makeup products, use a Clarisonic daily, and use Biore strips or a clay mask at least a couple times a week. The Clarisonic definitely makes a huge difference so I was wondering how much this product could really do. It turns out, a LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You spray it on dry skin (4-5 sprays seems to be more than enough), then use your hand or a wash cloth to rub the product off. You can see the product (and presumably dead skin) collecting and coming off and then you rinse with warm water. I noticed an immediate difference in appearance and especially texture - my skin was very smooth, fresh and clean looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; type product but based on my brief experiences with this one I would definitely repurchase. It&#x27;s expensive but since it&#x27;s a spray product it lasts a while, and it comes in a nice frosted glass bottle and is organic. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t love it as much as others reviewed here, and didn&#x27;t get the same result as others have said (which I guess is a good thing I don&#x27;t have massive amounts of gunk in my pores?!). But it does leave my skin feeling soft and smooth, is easy to spray on and use, and has a pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> I have highly sensitive skin and typically have a difficult time finding product I can use on it that doesn&#x27;t trigger outbreaks or strong allergic reactions. I find this product to work beautifully, it does what it says and sloughs off dead skin cells. I&#x27;ve used it up to 3-4x a week without any negative effects. I typically use it in the morning, before I moisturize and find my makeup looks considerably better when I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who&#x27;ve suggested that its the product that balls up, I wondered the same thing myself so I tested it out. One, I&#x27;ve used on peeling skin (post-sunburn), after the skin was no longer sensitive but dry and peeling. It took it ALL off without any irritation to the skin under. Two, I sprayed it on the ball of my foot, where the skin is thick with callouses and it SLOUGHED off in chunks. It was quite gross, actually... but it convinced me that this is indeed removing dead skin cells and not just product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the body peel, but it triggered an eczema flare up, so I&#x27;m unsure if the product is different, or that skin reacts differently. I also saw some mention the body peel is &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not sure if it is or isn&#x27;t, but I know I cannot use the product I bought off amazon.</li>
    <li> Love this product dont use it everyday but working up to.  Smells great even, doesnt smell all chemically.  Which is great!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> This is an amazing yet extremely gentle &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34;. I have very sensitive acne prone skin with blackheads and hyper pigmentation. And it exfoliates the skin wonderfully and makes my skin glow, soft, and supple.</li>
    <li> This product removes the top layer of skin from your face. After using my skin feels refreshed. I don&#x27;t quite know how it works without chemicals since it doesn&#x27;t seem to use any form of abrasion to remove the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can sting if it gets in your eyes but fairly easy to prevent that from happening.</li>
    <li> I am really hooked.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the product and it took all the dead skin off and made my skin very smooth and shiny .I am really excited I found it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for only a week now but so far I am impressed. This product makes it too easy to take care of your skin. Great price great product fast delivery and just happy all around with the way it has made my cystic acne improve and how it has brightened up my skin. you will definitely need to use moisturizer after or it will be drying out your skin which will then cause more oil to be produced</li>
