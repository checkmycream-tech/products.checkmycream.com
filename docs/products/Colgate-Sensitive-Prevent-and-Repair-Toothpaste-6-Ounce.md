      <li>good product at reasonable price</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my toothpaste because I want it to taste good, make your breath fresh, and not cost too much, and I can say I&#x27;m 100% happy with the results of this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>After about a month, I noticed a HUGE improvement.</li>
      <li>Fruit smoothies, slushee drinks, ice water are all pain free now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
      <li>Good product very similar to Sensodyne at a better price</li>
      <li>I have been using this for two months and have seen a significant decrease to sensitivity in my teeth.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands &amp; types of sensitive toothpaste, but this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>Makes my teeth feel clean, so i guess it does its job as a toothpaste.</li>
      <li>really helped with sensitivity, good taste, highly recommend</li>
      <li>Great price - I used this product previously and it works well at eliminating my tooth sensativity.</li>
      <li>It has the same amount of desensitizing ingredient in it that Sensodyne does and it has a nice minty flavor.</li>
      <li>This does remove surface stains and leaves my breath feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>I like the taste of this much better than the Crest Pro-Health for sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Not sure on how great it works on repairs and preventing sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
      <li>Using this paste also doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel as clean as it does while using normal toothpaste.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the first sensitivity toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Reading through other reviews, i seem to be the minority, but this kind of thing does appear to happen to some people.</li>
      <li>from what I&#x27;ve learned, you can&#x27;t really use a toothpaste to whiten yellow teeth, it&#x27;s really more for maintenance.</li>
      <li>I liked it just fine, but the price was just ridiculous, so I wanted to try something else.</li>
      <li>This brand of sensitive toothpase is as good as any other</li>
      <li>This paste is more messy than a gel would be, but it makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>But it did absolutely nothing for my sensitivity.</li>
      <li>So the combination of this Colgate toothpaste with a bit of oregano seems to work very well for me.</li>
      <li>It helps ward off my intense sensitivity</li>
      <li>It really works.</li>
      <li>My dentist has always been a big proponent of Sensodyne, but after still experiencing sensitivity when using that brand I decided to branch out and try Colgate&#x27;s version of sensitivity reduction toothpaste, I&#x27;m glad I did as after a couple of weeks of usage with this Colgate&#x27;s Sensitive Prevent</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not used to using paste, we usually use gel, so it is kind of a change.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get my teeth super white</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a decent toothpaste.</li>
      <li>, ive noticed my teeth are much more sensitive since i started using the new sensitive toothpaste.&amp;#34; She replied, surprised, that she had the same experience.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive teeth and tried the Crest Sensi-Repair.</li>
      <li>I recommend this toothpaste - but also recommend a visit to your dentist because sensitivity and pain means something needs to be fixed!</li>
      <li>My teeth feel sensitive sometimes, and when they do I use this toothpaste for a few days and then my teeth feel fine.</li>
      <li>I like the complete care</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>I would recommend Colgate Sensitive to anyone with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>Colgate Sensitive works for me.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t whiten as well as the sensitive toothpaste labeled for whitening.</li>
      <li>It was recommended by my dentist for sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and am always trying to find toothpaste that helps with sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>what I understand, the standard toothpastes are so powerful that they not only remove plaque but your enamel too.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and have tried every sensitive toothpaste I could find and this is the only one that has actually helped alleviate sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Like when youre young, you eat a bunch of candy and your teeth hurt the next day any time you try to eat something crunchy or chewy.</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t switch completely but will add this toothpaste to my very short list  -</li>
      <li>The active ingredients are much the same as the others -- 5% potassium nitrate and 0.24% sodium fluoride.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth with one little problem spot that would give me a huge zing at least once a day.</li>

<li> /&gt;Results may vary by individual but given my past experience that improvement I have seen for me I would recommend you give this toothpaste a try if you have sensitive teeth issues.</li>
<li> Over the past 2 years I&#x27;ve tried various toothpastes for sensitive teeth.</li>
<li> Really really good toothpast for annoying pain.</li>
<li> But I didn&#x27;t think that was necessary yet because the infection could&#x27;ve come from other than an infected root.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed less sensitivity on my molars that in the past really bothered me when eating acidic things like pineapple.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Sensodyne toothpaste for a long time due to sensitivity I have on my molars.  </li>
<li> After a few days the pain is much less frequent.</li>
<li> few months ago I had an infection in my upper gum and the dentist wanted to do a root canal.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days</li>
<li> There was that burning sensation like other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> I prefer Sensodyne toothpaste to any other when it come sto sensitivity issues with my teeth</li>
<li> I purchased this product due to the fact that it was cheaper than Sensodyne..</li>
<li> and I found the Sensodyne helps with the pain I used to get with extreme hots and colds.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, I have been using it for at least 2 months now and don&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in my sensitivity.</li>
<li> I like it and the price is much less than Sensodyne.</li>
<li> I have a dentist appointment in a few days for the tooth pain I&#x27;ve had for the past couple of weeks.</li>
<li> In a few days the pain subsided, and I hardly ever notice it.</li>
<li> I was having sensitivity to cold drinks and the dentist suggested any of the sensitive toothpastes.</li>
<li> Not sure if it will help everyone like that,</li>
<li> after using this for a month or so, it seems to have reduced the frequency of that one big zing (sensodyne was unable to achieve that).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month, and don&#x27;t feel any change in my teeth sensitivity.</li>
<li> I will try the Colgate Pro-argin toothpaste with arginine in it, if that doesnt help my sensitivity i will have to stop using Colgate and switch back to using Sensodyne(which got rid of my sensitivity to cold foods).</li>
<li> My tooth sensitivity is a thing of the past!</li>
<li> This works just as well and tends to be a bit less expensive.</li>
<li> Works as well as Sensodyne for me, but less expensive!</li>
<li> as for my other teeth, I can swish with cold water now!</li>
<li> Helps with sensitive teeth without the horrible taste</li>
<li> weird</li>
<li> so I can avoid pain from citrus and cold.</li>
<li> I have a problem with eating or drinking cold foods, and with this toothpaste it did help me not have any issues.</li>
<li> My gums are receding in places and, when cold things hit those areas, I jump though the roof.</li>
<li> He said they are designed to put a protective layer on the base of the teeth which will act like a barrier to cold liquids.</li>

    <li> Good product very similar to Sensodyne at a better price</li>
    <li> I like the taste of this much better than the Crest Pro-Health for sensitive teeth. Unfortunately, I have been using it for at least 2 months now and don&#x27;t notice a huge improvement in my sensitivity.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product due to the fact that it was cheaper than Sensodyne..BIG MISTAKE...Did not help at all..</li>
    <li> Great price - I used this product previously and it works well at eliminating my tooth sensativity.</li>
    <li> Works as well as Sensodyne for me, but less expensive!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Crest user for years and recently switched to this toothpaste. I have very sensitive teeth and tried the Crest Sensi-Repair. I liked it just fine, but the price was just ridiculous, so I wanted to try something else. I&#x27;m very picky about my toothpaste because I want it to taste good, make your breath fresh, and not cost too much, and I can say I&#x27;m 100% happy with the results of this toothpaste. It helps with sensitivity and everything else I just mentioned. I now have this toothpaste on my subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and am always trying to find toothpaste that helps with sensitivity.  Colgate Sensitive works for me.  I like the product and the price.</li>
    <li> Over the past 2 years I&#x27;ve tried various toothpastes for sensitive teeth. This Colgate one is the latest. I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days but I like the taste and feel better than the others. The active ingredients are much the same as the others -- 5% potassium nitrate and 0.24% sodium fluoride. But sometimes it&#x27;s the inactive ingredients that make the difference for feel and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago I had an infection in my upper gum and the dentist wanted to do a root canal. But I didn&#x27;t think that was necessary yet because the infection could&#x27;ve come from other than an infected root. So I added oregano essential oil to my toothpaste. In a few days the pain subsided, and I hardly ever notice it. So the combination of this Colgate toothpaste with a bit of oregano seems to work very well for me.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel clean, so i guess it does its job as a toothpaste. But it did absolutely nothing for my sensitivity. I will try the Colgate Pro-argin toothpaste with arginine in it, if that doesnt help my sensitivity i will have to stop using Colgate and switch back to using Sensodyne(which got rid of my sensitivity to cold foods).</li>
    <li> from what I&#x27;ve learned, you can&#x27;t really use a toothpaste to whiten yellow teeth, it&#x27;s really more for maintenance. I use this with my sonicare and my (professionally whitened) teeth have remained unstained, in spite of the fact that I drink black coffee daily. I feel like that sonicare is a key part of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also I have sensitive teeth with one little problem spot that would give me a huge zing at least once a day. after using this for a month or so, it seems to have reduced the frequency of that one big zing (sensodyne was unable to achieve that). as for my other teeth, I can swish with cold water now! that was something I couldn&#x27;t do before.</li>
    <li> really helped with sensitivity, good taste, highly recommend</li>
    <li> Works great our Dentist adores the healthy mouth checkups.</li>
    <li> I used this paste for about 5 days, at which point Isaid to my wife &amp;#34;pretty weird, ive noticed my teeth are much more sensitive since i started using the new sensitive toothpaste.&amp;#34; She replied, surprised, that she had the same experience. It physically made my teeth hurt. Like when youre young, you eat a bunch of candy and your teeth hurt the next day any time you try to eat something crunchy or chewy. I discontinued immediately and started using Sensodyne with no difficulty. Reading through other reviews, i seem to be the minority, but this kind of thing does appear to happen to some people.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me. I like Colgate brand toothpastes because you do not need to remove the top to use on toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It works! I love this; it takes all sensitivity away just like it says.</li>
    <li> Really really good toothpast for annoying pain.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and have tried every sensitive toothpaste I could find and this is the only one that has actually helped alleviate sensitivity. I have been using this for two months and have seen a significant decrease to sensitivity in my teeth. I can tolerate cool water better and heat better than before using this toothpaste. I am so sold on this toothpaste that it is part of my monthly subscribe and save order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results may vary by individual but given my past experience that improvement I have seen for me I would recommend you give this toothpaste a try if you have sensitive teeth issues.</li>
    <li> and it doesn&#x27;t whiten as well as the sensitive toothpaste labeled for whitening. Or its all my imagination since the ingredients are the same?</li>
    <li> This is the first sensitivity toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried. I have a dentist appointment in a few days for the tooth pain I&#x27;ve had for the past couple of weeks. I&#x27;ve been using Orajel because of the pain. I decided to try a sensitivity toothpaste and chose Colgate because I trust the brand. When the pain starts I brush with this toothpaste and the pain subsides. After a few days the pain is much less frequent. I recommend this toothpaste - but also recommend a visit to your dentist because sensitivity and pain means something needs to be fixed!</li>
    <li> Any of colgate&#x27;s sensitve toothpastes are good and don&#x27;t taste funky like sensodyne. I was having sensitivity to cold drinks and the dentist suggested any of the sensitive toothpastes. He said they are designed to put a protective layer on the base of the teeth which will act like a barrier to cold liquids. After about a month, I noticed a HUGE improvement. I could drink ice tea with out any pain or sensitivity in my teeth. Fruit smoothies, slushee drinks, ice water are all pain free now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I understand, the standard toothpastes are so powerful that they not only remove plaque but your enamel too. I had no idea.</li>
    <li> POTASSIUM NITRATE. USED IN WW2 TO GIs. ALSO CALLED SALT PETER.  WHY TO TAKE AWAY SERVICE MENS SEXUAL DESIRE GOOGLE IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of Sensodyne toothpaste for a long time due to sensitivity I have on my molars.  My dentist has always been a big proponent of Sensodyne, but after still experiencing sensitivity when using that brand I decided to branch out and try Colgate&#x27;s version of sensitivity reduction toothpaste, I&#x27;m glad I did as after a couple of weeks of usage with this Colgate&#x27;s Sensitive Prevent I&#x27;ve noticed less sensitivity on my molars that in the past really bothered me when eating acidic things like pineapple.  That&#x27;s anecdotal evidence from one person of course, but this toothpaste seems to work for me and so I&#x27;m sticking with it as my regular go to toothpaste so I can avoid pain from citrus and cold.</li>
    <li> My tooth sensitivity is a thing of the past! Now I can drink water and eat ice and all kinds of stuff. My dentist approves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month, and don&#x27;t feel any change in my teeth sensitivity. Using this paste also doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel as clean as it does while using normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent toothpaste. Not sure on how great it works on repairs and preventing sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Will update if there are any changes.</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; item!</li>
    <li> love the toothpaste.  It was recommended by my dentist for sensitive teeth.  It really works.</li>
    <li> Just as good as Sensodyne.  I have sensitive teeth and I found the Sensodyne helps with the pain I used to get with extreme hots and colds.  This works just as well and tends to be a bit less expensive.</li>
    <li> I am very happy, my teeth are happy.</li>
    <li> This brand of sensitive toothpase is as good as any other I like the complete care</li>
    <li> Love it! Nice and foamy!</li>
    <li> Helps with sensitive teeth without the horrible taste</li>
    <li> This toothpaste was surprisingly clean feeling and tasted great.  There was that burning sensation like other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.  And because of this toothpaste, I was able to brush longer and enjoy it!</li>
    <li> It helped relieve the sensitivity. After using it 2 times a day for 2 days I noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I would recommend Colgate Sensitive to anyone with sensitive teeth. I have a problem with eating or drinking cold foods, and with this toothpaste it did help me not have any issues. I was using a dentist prescribed toothpaste, but I see this working just as well.</li>
    <li> good product at reasonable price</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive teeth. My gums are receding in places and, when cold things hit those areas, I jump though the roof. Well, I feel like it at the time. I prefer Sensodyne toothpaste to any other when it come sto sensitivity issues with my teeth but this Colgate variety is quite good. It has the same amount of desensitizing ingredient in it that Sensodyne does and it has a nice minty flavor. It helps ward off my intense sensitivity but it takes a week or so of daily use to feel the difference. It doesn&#x27;t get my teeth super white but I use activated charcoal for that. This does remove surface stains and leaves my breath feeling fresh. I like it and the price is much less than Sensodyne. I won&#x27;t switch completely but will add this toothpaste to my very short list  - Sensodyne brand - of toothpastes that I use for helping to desensitize my teeth while giving me all the benefits of regular toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands &amp; types of sensitive toothpaste, but this stuff is the best I&#x27;ve found.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel sensitive sometimes, and when they do I use this toothpaste for a few days and then my teeth feel fine. Not sure if it will help everyone like that, but it works for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not used to using paste, we usually use gel, so it is kind of a change. This paste is more messy than a gel would be, but it makes your teeth feel clean.</li>
    <li> Helps tremendously with sensitivity and has a nice taste.</li>
