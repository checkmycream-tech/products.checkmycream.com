      <li>beautiful comb</li>
      <li>great, don&#x27;t have to worry about it snapping in my pocket</li>

      <li>This is a good comb, but not quite what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>My father and brother love their combs!</li>
      <li>Great on light tangles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased to leave this item a 5-star review, and am more than happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>it comes in really nice packaging too.</li>
      <li>Close teeth add to catching and pulling hairs.</li>
      <li>I mostly picked out this comb to keep in a nice kit, but I do like it</li>
      <li>Chicago Comb is by far one of the best companies I have ever dealt with.</li>
      <li>striking; the finger hole is a nice touch.&lt;br</li>
      <li>teeth are nice a smooth; does not scratch the scalp</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be able to use it to dig a hole and bury it.</li>
      <li>I now have a comb that I am completely satisfied with and Chicago Comb has another satisfied customer.</li>
      <li>the customer service and communications are even better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice matte finish, though it&#x27;s also available in a polished version.</li>
      <li>Very happy to support an american made product!</li>
      <li>The combs are outstanding.....</li>
      <li>I at 3 stars, I am changing it to five based mostly on the customer service I received from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The titanium comb labeled &amp;#34;father&#x27;s day gift&amp;#34; is better (it&#x27;s also an inch or so shorter, better pocket size.</li>
      <li>hole seems to be mostly for the leather case designed for it.&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
      <li>The product is beautifully packaged, the metal is solid and finished elegantly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;d also prefer something with finer and more finely spaced teeth, but none of their models quite fit what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>The hand-finish is perfect, there are no burrs or sharp edges to catch on hair or scalp.</li>
      <li>easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-Thicker</li>
      <li>I like the teeth, engraving, design (ring is awesome), ease of cleaning, durability, and slight &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; when using.</li>
      <li>Light, but strong.</li>
      <li>John processed and insured my order was completed accurately.</li>
      <li>(...and I admit that I enjoy the *schinggg* sound it makes when I pull it from the pocket of my jeans.</li>
      <li>Great comb as expected.</li>
      <li>the price paid , this comb should be stamped with the  company name and U.S.A.( If true ).</li>
      <li>That seems rare this day and age and is certainly the top of my agenda when paying $75 for a comb, sheeth (from their website), and personalized engraving.</li>
      <li>highly recommend the product and will continue ordering more as presents for friends/family.</li>
      <li>The comb will probably outlive me unless I decide to use it to pry open a door or use it monkey-wrench style and attempt to throw it into the cogs of a machine.&lt;br /&gt;- Handsome design!</li>
      <li>Easily worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Masculine, but stylish.</li>
      <li>The leather sheath for this is actually pretty nice, but I think they should have cut it for the comb to fit in the other direction (with the stitches on the spine of the comb instead of against the teeth)  </li>
      <li>I thought it would be cool to have an extremely high quality comb.</li>
      <li>It was made this way as the first two teeth are stuck together.</li>
      <li>a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like!&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless steel!</li>
      <li>The precision of the laser&#x27;s cut is consistent and even.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>I love my new Chicago Comb Co. Comb, which arrived last week.</li>
      <li>Even if I ever get a dud or bad experience, I am convinced via the excellent customer service I have received to date that the issue would be solved quickly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>If your hair is not prone to tangles, or if your hair is short then this comb could work just fine for you.</li>
      <li>Caught my hair constantly while the cheap plastic comb I have never does.  </li>
      <li>Thanks again.</li>
      <li>comb is very durable.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s really sturdy and well made.  </li>
      <li>I like the comb, but it&#x27;s very grabby -- the ends of the teeth are finished and smooth, but the side edges on the teeth are pretty sharp.  </li>
      <li>Definitely an item that could easily last more than a lifetime.</li>
      <li>This is a truly high quality comb</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to any of my friends or family.</li>
      <li>I received a response very quickly, that same day (less than 2 hours, but I assume it would be less if it weren&#x27;t for the time difference as the time I emailed from California was around 6am in Chicago) and the employee was courteous and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
      <li>Classy comb for a Christmas gift without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
      <li>Should last forever, really.</li>
      <li>I did my research and chose &amp;#34;Chicago Comb Company.&amp;#34; I purchased directly from their website because I wanted to have the comb</li>
      <li>Now I own an expensive, no name, maybe made in China comb .     </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll probably try to figure out some way to sand them down before I use it much.  </li>

<li> heavy.</li>
<li> Just saying, it&#x27;s heavy, even if you expect it to be heavy.</li>
<li> There is no better fathers day gift on earth.</li>
<li> But it is tough.  </li>
<li> I have been using this comb for approximately 6 months</li>
<li> A bit expensive, considering I dropped about $30 on a comb.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with a case or sleeve, though you can order a leather sleeve through Chicago Comb&#x27;s website.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t see a reason for it to be that expensive.</li>
<li> Hated it.  </li>

    <li> Classy comb for a Christmas gift without breaking the bank.&lt;br /&gt;Last Christmas, I bought 4, one for each guy in my family and they loved it.</li>
    <li> This comb is gonna last through the apocalypse! A little pricy, but it&#x27;s solid and well built.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a comb, it works as you would expect.  Should last forever, really.</li>
    <li> Form:&lt;br /&gt;-Looks striking; the finger hole is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;-No markings at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function:&lt;br /&gt;-Good tooth spacing.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not clog; easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;-Thicker than you&#x27;d think. Very durable.&lt;br /&gt;-Size doesn&#x27;t seem too small or too large.&lt;br /&gt;-Finger hole seems to be mostly for the leather case designed for it.&lt;br /&gt;-The teeth are nice a smooth; does not scratch the scalp unnecessarily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb is very durable. Almost no flex I can detect. Definitely an item that could easily last more than a lifetime. Easily worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the black leather sheath made for this comb. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be cool to have an extremely high quality comb. I did my research and chose &amp;#34;Chicago Comb Company.&amp;#34; I purchased directly from their website because I wanted to have the comb engraved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb arrived in a timely manner and I began to use it daily. I have been using this comb for approximately 6 months and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! This is a truly high quality comb and it still looks brand new. I like the teeth, engraving, design (ring is awesome), ease of cleaning, durability, and slight &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; when using. I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now ordered three of these combs - one for me and two as presents. My father and brother love their combs! When paying via Paypal the operator of the company noticed I did not write an engraving message. The issue was solved within an hour via email. The customer service was excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product and will continue ordering more as presents for friends/family. Even if I ever get a dud or bad experience, I am convinced via the excellent customer service I have received to date that the issue would be solved quickly and painlessly. That seems rare this day and age and is certainly the top of my agenda when paying $75 for a comb, sheeth (from their website), and personalized engraving.</li>
    <li> heavy. the teeth have sharp sides, the edges along all the cuts are sharp. if the edges were rounded it could be great. I&#x27;d also like the teeth to be further apart. Close teeth add to catching and pulling hairs. This thing is very heavy, and tends to hit the head harder than a lighter comb (momentum). Yes, I realize it&#x27;s stainless steel which is heavy... Just saying, it&#x27;s heavy, even if you expect it to be heavy. The titanium comb labeled &amp;#34;father&#x27;s day gift&amp;#34; is better (it&#x27;s also an inch or so shorter, better pocket size. Also, the finger Hole on this comb does not make it easier to hold.  The leather sheath for this is actually pretty nice, but I think they should have cut it for the comb to fit in the other direction (with the stitches on the spine of the comb instead of against the teeth)  EDIT: If your hair is not prone to tangles, or if your hair is short then this comb could work just fine for you.</li>
    <li> Great metal comb with weighted handle.</li>
    <li> Best. Comb. Ever.  built to last, and should for a lifetime.  I hope they comb my hair when I die with this thing.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite decide between 3 and 4 stars.  I like the comb, but it&#x27;s very grabby -- the ends of the teeth are finished and smooth, but the side edges on the teeth are pretty sharp.  I&#x27;ll probably try to figure out some way to sand them down before I use it much.  (Hopefully I won&#x27;t have to resort to sandpapering each individual tooth, that will take a while!)  So that&#x27;s minus a star or two.  I&#x27;d also prefer something with finer and more finely spaced teeth, but none of their models quite fit what I was looking for.  I knew that going in, so I&#x27;m not knocking this model for that.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend bought this for me for Christmas. This was exactly what I needed. This is a comb built to last. This is a comb that will never break. Light, but strong. Masculine, but stylish. This comb will be in my pocket the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> beautiful comb that&#x27;s really sturdy and well made.  my husband uses it every day and loves it.  it comes in really nice packaging too.</li>
    <li> I bought a comb for my father&#x27;s 70th birthday and it was an excellent choice.  The product is beautifully packaged, the metal is solid and finished elegantly.  I would highly recommend this to any of my friends or family.</li>
    <li> Great comb as expected.</li>
    <li> The combs are outstanding.....the customer service and communications are even better. I ordered the matte finish with custom engraving. The combs were packaged and sent as a gift for my father. John processed and insured my order was completed accurately. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> great, don&#x27;t have to worry about it snapping in my pocket</li>
    <li> This is a good comb, but not quite what I was expecting. I would prefer one with slightly finer teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2/5/15) - Having previously rated this comb I at 3 stars, I am changing it to five based mostly on the customer service I received from the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time I am typing this, there is one comment to my review. It is from Tedd, the co-founder of Chicago Comb. Having read my review, he offered to exchange my No. 1 steel comb for a No. 3 with finer teeth. I contacted Chicago Comb and agreed, we exchanged a couple of e-mails, and VOILA! They shipped my replacement comb on a Friday and I received it the following Tuesday. I now have a comb that I am completely satisfied with and Chicago Comb has another satisfied customer. Win-win. This is customer service the way it should be.</li>
    <li> To bad it&#x27;s not any better than Chinese made. The tip is bent. This is not a transportation damage. It was made this way as the first two teeth are stuck together. For a $40 comb I expect better.&lt;br /&gt;Where is all that &amp;#34;American made with pride&amp;#34; stuff?</li>
    <li> Hated it.  Caught my hair constantly while the cheap plastic comb I have never does.  Plus the teeth are thick and too far apart.  But it is tough.  I&#x27;ll be able to use it to dig a hole and bury it.</li>
    <li> Best comb ever. Doesn&#x27;t beat my scalp. Great on light tangles.</li>
    <li> I love my new Chicago Comb Co. Comb, which arrived last week. It has immediately become my daily go to comb, and is kept with me throughout the day. The hand-finish is perfect, there are no burrs or sharp edges to catch on hair or scalp. The precision of the laser&#x27;s cut is consistent and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had the pleasure of speaking with their customer support, whom I emailed. I received a response very quickly, that same day (less than 2 hours, but I assume it would be less if it weren&#x27;t for the time difference as the time I emailed from California was around 6am in Chicago) and the employee was courteous and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased to leave this item a 5-star review, and am more than happy with my purchase. The only thing I wish were different would be for the smaller Model 2 comb come with it as a set.</li>
    <li> I mostly picked out this comb to keep in a nice kit, but I do like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like!&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless steel! The comb will probably outlive me unless I decide to use it to pry open a door or use it monkey-wrench style and attempt to throw it into the cogs of a machine.&lt;br /&gt;- Handsome design! It&#x27;s a nice matte finish, though it&#x27;s also available in a polished version. The finger hole is a neat touch, and lets you spin it around your finger like a revolver or a knife before you slick back your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Dislike!&lt;br /&gt;- A bit expensive, considering I dropped about $30 on a comb.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t come with a case or sleeve, though you can order a leather sleeve through Chicago Comb&#x27;s website.</li>
    <li> I like the way it feels, solid! it is the LAST comb i will buy!</li>
    <li> When I opened the package I was surprised to find it contained a a comb manufactured in an unknown country by an unknown manufacturer . Nothing was stamped on it .For the price paid , this comb should be stamped with the  company name and U.S.A.( If true ). Now I own an expensive, no name, maybe made in China comb .     it comtained</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot, if the price point were closer to $20 I would buy another. Very happy to support an american made product!</li>
    <li> I have had my chicago comb set for over a year now and I don&#x27;t think I will never need to buy another comb in my life, unless I lose them. I hope to pass these on to my grandchildren. Chicago Comb is by far one of the best companies I have ever dealt with. There is no better fathers day gift on earth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. This item will be around long after I&#x27;m underground. It loses one star for costing nearly $40. I can&#x27;t see a reason for it to be that expensive. Otherwise, it&#x27;s an excellent, manly accessory.  (...and I admit that I enjoy the *schinggg* sound it makes when I pull it from the pocket of my jeans.</li>
