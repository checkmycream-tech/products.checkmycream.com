      <li>First off this smells soooo good!</li>
      <li>Love, love, love these products, they work good for my hair and  </li>
      <li>So smooth!</li>
      <li>but it also had to be color safe since I dye my hair often.</li>
      <li>I was also concerned that I&#x27;d not be able to return it if I opened the blister</li>
      <li>I still use the oil it came with and love it, but I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so that makes it even better</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The conditioner seemed better.</li>

      <li>the packaging is just really so cute.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t post many online reviews</li>
      <li>Well after a three day used my hair never look better.</li>
      <li>I have skin allergies to wheat (gluten), which is in so many hair care products.</li>
      <li>I love the effect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair has retained the quality that this product delivers, even two days later, which tells me that this shampoo has quality ingredients that are the perfect blend to make one realize that you do indeed get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>I love it, it&#x27;s changed my life.  </li>
      <li>While there are sulfates in this product (Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate for example), they are more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; and do not cause me problems.</li>
      <li>I love if. Will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>It looked fantastic!  </li>
      <li>This is by far, the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used and my hair feels and looks better than it has ever been in years even after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my hair feeling really soft smells great and</li>
      <li>Not an easy feat.  </li>
      <li>With this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair is healthy, full, glossy, and smooth, period.</li>
      <li>so finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair would be ideal.</li>
      <li>The use of all three products also layered/reinforced the pleasant and natural scent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels amazing its soft and silky and I am so in love with this product.</li>
      <li>I had been using Alterna, another product that is gluten and sulfate free.</li>
      <li>The Argan Oil is also a great heat defense, so my hair is protected from daily blow drying and straightening.</li>
      <li>This product and the deep penetrating oil are pricey, but you get great results.</li>
      <li>This is also free of gluten.</li>
      <li>The shampoo/conditioner is silky and the oil is really light.  </li>
      <li>I loved the fact it had natural ingredients including argan oil, cocoa butter extract, coconut oil, avocado oil, aloe extract.</li>
      <li>I bought this set about two months ago and fell in love with it right away.</li>
      <li>I was extremely excited to get this in the duo.</li>
      <li>but I say is worth it!</li>
      <li>do not think it is really color safe.  </li>
      <li>This product has a nice spicy smell, not fruity or harsh like most others, and leaves my hair clean, shiny, and snarl free.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am totally indebted to the Organix company for saving me hundreds of future dollars in my quest for the perfect shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I have been using this shampoo and conditioner set, (and using the penetrating oil twice a week) for several weeks now, and am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>I was amazed at how healthy-looking, shiny, smooth, and pretty my dry/frizzy hair had become.  </li>
      <li>That was until the very FIRST time I used this Organix Argan Oil trio!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really did love it for the first couple months.</li>
      <li>I leaves her hair silky smooth almost like it isn&#x27;t real.</li>
      <li>It is b far my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>Love it...used in my hair yesterday and now it is really feeling silky soft and smooth...</li>
      <li>My hair is straight and tends to be dry and tangle easily, so I&#x27;m always looking for effective moisturizing &amp; detangling stuff.</li>
      <li>used all three products and could not believe that the promises typed on the outside of the bottles were...get this...actually true!!  </li>
      <li>GAH, orangix, please make new bottles!!!</li>
      <li>Based on the reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t try their other products just yet, but I am very pleased with Oragnix&#x27; Moroccan Argan Oil Combo Pack.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s pretty strong and masculine</li>
      <li>After the first use, my hair feels noticeably softer and shinier.</li>
      <li>Ok it got this last week</li>
      <li>and I absolutely LOVE the smell of One N&#x27; Only!  </li>
      <li>I thought I would use it just a couple of times a week, but I love it, and use it daily.</li>
      <li>I should of gone back and bought 5 more packages before they did not have it anymore..  </li>
      <li>The oil is used prior to my styling and my hair has never looked better</li>
      <li>After only ONE USE my hair was softer, shinier, more supple, way less frizzy and it smelled fantastic!  </li>
      <li>so It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good conditioner</li>
      <li>The shampoo and conditioner work wonders (as well as having a very pleasing scent) but the real treasure is the oil.</li>
      <li>My stylist knows I&#x27;m very into saving money and organic products.</li>
      <li>Garnier and Dove cause too much build-up, and Suave dries me out.</li>
      <li>The product is really nice.has</li>
      <li>The penetrating oil is a real treat for the skin, too.</li>
      <li>straight every day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The whole system made my hair softer but The shampoo seems like it stripped it out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After using it for 3 days straight</li>
      <li>I have really bleach damaged hair with lots of split ends</li>
      <li>love my salon brand, S Factor, but I am taking my time replacing my low supplies of this more expensive brand because I am so pleased with Organix.</li>
      <li>I am very please with this product.</li>
      <li>I picked up samples of this shampoo &amp; conditioner and liked them enough to buy bigger sizes.</li>
      <li>For the first time in my life, my hair is soft, springy, and glowing.</li>
      <li>or if you&#x27;re looking for a better conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh down your hair. .</li>
      <li>The new chemicals even include dimethicone!</li>
      <li>Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday it still smell really good the next day.</li>
      <li>In my search for the best deal online, with a tough task to beat Costco prices, as has been mentioned in several reviews, I settled for buying these three items individually coming very close to the unbeatable Costco price.</li>
      <li>Other folks had written about the scent being, &#x27;clean&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27;, like &#x27;fresh cut grass&#x27;, or shampoos used in the salons, etc.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>This keeps my scalp clear, and my hair is shiny, smooth, and frizz free (it looks even better than it did while using the expensive stuff!)</li>
      <li>I have naturally really curly hair and this stuff makes it soo soft and</li>
      <li>I decided to see if this shampoo was worth the extra money, or would it be just another item</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is b far my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite shampoo and conditioner. I leaves her hair silky smooth almost like it isn&#x27;t real. Would recommend to any female.</li>
    <li> I loveee Organix products! This could not be different! Price is just perfect, it smells pretty good and my hair.... Hmmmmm!!! So smooth! Geniousss!!! Every woman deserve this!</li>
    <li> I have skin allergies to wheat (gluten), which is in so many hair care products. Also, traditional sulfates clog the pores on my scalp and give me build-up and scabs. While there are sulfates in this product (Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate for example), they are more \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; and do not cause me problems. This is also free of gluten. I had been using Alterna, another product that is gluten and sulfate free. But it is SO EXPENSIVE!! I put myself on a budget and had to cut costs. A few other drugstore products that are gluten free include: Garnier, Dove, Suave, and Organix. Garnier and Dove cause too much build-up, and Suave dries me out. This keeps my scalp clear, and my hair is shiny, smooth, and frizz free (it looks even better than it did while using the expensive stuff!) The Argan Oil is also a great heat defense, so my hair is protected from daily blow drying and straightening. I wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much money in the past buying such expensive products, when this was readily available.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it&#x27;s good stuff, I just wish it came a bit faster which is why I gave only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I went to the drug store to find SOMETHING I could use to try and moisturize my hair without making it greasy and flat at the same time but it also had to be color safe since I dye my hair often. Not an easy feat.  I saw these products and decided to try the deep conditioning mask with Argan Oil in it by Organix.  I was amazed.  After only ONE USE my hair was softer, shinier, more supple, way less frizzy and it smelled fantastic!  It looked fantastic!  I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  I then went out and bought the rest of the Organix Argan Oil infused set and I am simply amazed.  The difference in my dull, lifeless, greasy or frizzy (depending on the day) hair was awesome and it is, without question, the best I&#x27;ve seen it in a long time.  I have recommended this product to friends and family and will do so again and again.  I love it, it&#x27;s changed my life.  I no longer need to buy stock (not really) in leave in conditioner products because these do everything I need.  I no longer need to go and try a new conditioning mask or oil every month because I know the products I already have will and DO work so well.  I definitely recommend trying these products out if you have dry or frizzy hair or if you&#x27;re looking for a better conditioner that won&#x27;t weigh down your hair. .</li>
    <li> This product makes my coarse hair feel very soft. I love it. The oil is used prior to my styling and my hair has never looked better</li>
    <li> High quality products like these are hard to find for my hair type.  Long, curly, frizzy, dry hair is hard to care for.  I buy this shampoo every once in awhile (if I use a product too often, it weighs my hair down).  My hair looks shiny, healthy, no frizz and it curls really beautifully after using all these products.  It smells good.  The shampoo/conditioner is silky and the oil is really light.  I just hate how you can&#x27;t store the bottle upside down so that you can get all the product out.  GAH, orangix, please make new bottles!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a recommendation from a friend and can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes in my hair. Love it!</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this set. Great price for a great set. The oil in itself is expensive cause it gets the job done. I love if. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, but came in a different package than what is pictured (the hair oil came in a clear bottle--same volume of liquid though, so no worries). Girlfriend loves it, would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner set, (and using the penetrating oil twice a week) for several weeks now, and am very pleased with the results. My hair is naturally healthy, \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; thick, and generally shiny. Sometimes, on \\&quot;bad hair days,\\&quot; it can look a teeeeny bit frizzy or coarse. With this shampoo and conditioner combination, my hair is healthy, full, glossy, and smooth, period. I love the effect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried some over-the-counter shampoos and conditioners before that make my hair feel greasy and a little flat so I usually purchase my shampoos and conditioners from my hair salon. I found this three-pack at Costco to stretch out my use of the more expensive, salon shampoo and conditioner. I thought I would use it just a couple of times a week, but I love it, and use it daily. This daily use does not strip my hair and dry it out, nor does it make it look greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my salon brand, S Factor, but I am taking my time replacing my low supplies of this more expensive brand because I am so pleased with Organix. I specifically wanted to write a review because I had never heard of this brand before, and wanted to read customer reviews. The reviews were quite negative, EXCEPT for this product line for this brand, but I think the reviews were still mixed. Based on the reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t try their other products just yet, but I am very pleased with Oragnix&#x27; Moroccan Argan Oil Combo Pack.</li>
    <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner for about a month now, alternating every other day with a different brand. For the first time in my life, my hair is soft, springy, and glowing. It even feels thicker. I have been getting compliments on the beauty of my hair!  People are reaching up to touch it, which is a bit disturbing. My hair is turning white in large streaks, and even the white hair is soft. This one is staying on my shopping list!</li>
    <li> My hair is wavy/curly and was very dry.  After using Organix Moroccan Argan Oil, for the past two weeks, my hair is softer and more manageable.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time I could get a comb through my hair without bending the comb or ripping out my hair.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> For a year, I had been using One N&#x27; Only Argan Oil Shampoo, Conditioner and Argan Oil Leave-in Treatment (from Sally&#x27;s.)  Both performance and scent are big factors in my choice of hair supplies and I absolutely LOVE the smell of One N&#x27; Only!  (It reminds me of raw pipe tobacco though not manly.)  As for its performance....well, I only THOUGHT it was working well at conditioning and smoothing my dry, wavy, frizzy, blonde/white hair.  That was until the very FIRST time I used this Organix Argan Oil trio!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit it was a Costco &#x27;impulse buy&#x27; at the time.  Although rare to ever purchase something that&#x27;s not awesome at Costco, I did worry about it smelling horrible because it&#x27;s &#x27;organic&#x27;.  I was also concerned that I&#x27;d not be able to return it if I opened the blister pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I got home, I fervently began researching others&#x27; online reviews to see just what this stuff was all about.  Other folks had written about the scent being, &#x27;clean&#x27;, &#x27;natural&#x27;, like &#x27;fresh cut grass&#x27;, or shampoos used in the salons, etc.  Well, those smells I did not find offensive so I opened the package and followed the printed directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used all three products and could not believe that the promises typed on the outside of the bottles were...get this...actually true!!  I was amazed at how healthy-looking, shiny, smooth, and pretty my dry/frizzy hair had become.  The use of all three products also layered/reinforced the pleasant and natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another property I realized after using the products a few times: the conditioner actually &#x27;lathers&#x27;, with the post-shampoo moisture in your hair, which helps to evenly distribute it throughout.  And the Penetrating Oil is a Godsend; it absorbs so quickly yet doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down or make it look oily -- even on day two.  [The One N&#x27; Only Leave-in Oil Treatment does, however; but I&#x27;m now using a few drops of that mixed with my body lotion for a bit of a shine on my skin instead.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally indebted to the Organix company for saving me hundreds of future dollars in my quest for the perfect shampoo and conditioner.  And my husband thanks them too because now the shower caddy is a LOT less crowded -- minus the cr@p that doesn&#x27;t really do what it says it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t post many online reviews but I DO read them.  When I think a product is amazing, I will take the time to post; this stuff warrants one.</li>
    <li> I picked up samples of this shampoo &amp; conditioner and liked them enough to buy bigger sizes. My hair is straight and tends to be dry and tangle easily, so I&#x27;m always looking for effective moisturizing &amp; detangling stuff. This product has a nice spicy smell, not fruity or harsh like most others, and leaves my hair clean, shiny, and snarl free. Recommend the shampoo and conditioner; haven&#x27;t tried the other product that&#x27;s included yet.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked me to buy these three products. In my search for the best deal online, with a tough task to beat Costco prices, as has been mentioned in several reviews, I settled for buying these three items individually coming very close to the unbeatable Costco price. Even on Amazon, buying these three products individually costs considerably less that buying them in a proposed 3-set package. It&#x27;s just a matter of simple arithmetic. I ma taking one star off for overpricing.</li>
    <li> I also got this at Costco for 13.00 for the shampoo, conditioner and oil pack--  I should of gone back and bought 5 more packages before they did not have it anymore..  I LOVE this stuff and my hair is all &#x27;good hair days&#x27; using this combo..  but it is sure a lot more $$$ here.  I will keep watching for it at Costco.</li>
    <li> The shampoo works great, the conditioner works great and the oil also works great! I would order them again but 3 days after receiving the package I found that a local big name store sells them for half of what I paid here. Wish I had checked but lesson learned!</li>
    <li> This is the first product that has ever addressed my curly, dry hair problem. Using only oils did not solve my issues of &amp;#34;bad hair days&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I bought this set about two months ago and fell in love with it right away. My hair felt so soft! Well now when I use it (two months later) it makes parts of my hair scrunch up, its looks as if you took a strand of hair between your finger and your nail and pull down on it. Now I have fine hair so maybe it wont do this to someone with thick hair. I still use the oil it came with and love it, but I had to stop using the shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 3 stars because it may work for some women and I really did love it for the first couple months.</li>
    <li> My hair gets colored and tends to become dry. My stylist knows I&#x27;m very into saving money and organic products. She recommended this product to me and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with how soft and manageable my hair is now!</li>
    <li> I tried this brand of shampoo the other day, as my wife loves anything that&#x27;s all natural due to allergies. I normally approach the whole &#x27;organic&#x27; label with skepticism, especially with foods. I decided to see if this shampoo was worth the extra money, or would it be just another item that&#x27;s overpriced and underperforming. I must say that this shampoo is a dream, in that its oils must penetrate enough to where it actually leaves hair smooth, shiny and full of body, especially for people with thinner and drier hair. The scent is pleasant, too. I also found that even after I washed my hair with a different and much cheaper shampoo the next day, the results of this product were still there. My hair has retained the quality that this product delivers, even two days later, which tells me that this shampoo has quality ingredients that are the perfect blend to make one realize that you do indeed get what you pay for. This product and the deep penetrating oil are pricey, but you get great results. This product accomplishes its objective. Perhaps the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried. The penetrating oil is a real treat for the skin, too.</li>
    <li> I was extremely excited to get this in the duo. I had been eyeing their products for awhile at my salon and when I went to the grocery store. I read some reviews on line and was skeptical but I decided to dive In and try it. I just got done blow drying my hair after using all 3 products. The shampoo lathered like soap would on your body so that was the first bad sign. When I washed it out my hair was completely stripped. I decided maybe the conditioner would replenish it and I could just use a different shampoo, so I used the conditioner and left it in for about 5 minutes or so. When I washed it out... Not much of a difference! I was so disappointed. My hair was dry and clumpy. I then used the serum in high hopes and put beat protectant in my hair and began to blow dry it. I noticed how straw like my hair was and frizzy it became. Over all I&#x27;m way disappointed I was really excited to try this out. I have really bleach damaged hair with lots of split ends so It&#x27;s hard for me to find a good conditioner but Joico seems to work the best for me. Back to my search!</li>
    <li> i use these every other time i wash my hair  i can&#x27;t use everytime as my hair gets to oily</li>
    <li> I first bought this product at Costco, and I was a little nervous about using it. I have very long hair so finding a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair would be ideal. So I started to use this product, I ended up loving the smell, and the change I noticed on my hair was amazing. Since I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday it still smell really good the next day. I am very please with this product. So i went back to Costco and they didn&#x27;t have it anymore, so I found it here is a bit more expensive but I say is worth it!</li>
    <li> The product did not come in the package as it is advertised. Also, the shampoo bottle was leaking. I will NOT be buying from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love these products, they work good for my hair and  weaves also, I would use these products again.</li>
    <li> I see reviewers calling these Organix argan products \\&quot;all natural\\&quot; and organic. They are neither. I&#x27;m listing the ingredients below. People should know what they&#x27;re buying. Why call themselves Organix???  It&#x27;s wrong for this company to mislead in this way. I bought this set at Costco (I may return it). On my first use, today, the shampoo seemed harsh. The conditioner seemed better. I used the oil and my eyes have been burning all evening (no, I didn&#x27;t get it in them, I think it&#x27;s just the fumes from it being in my hair), too bad because the oil makes my hair soft, seems like the best of the three products here. I don&#x27;t think this is a miracle product, but it&#x27;s not too pricey, either. I don&#x27;t like the fragrance, it&#x27;s pretty strong and masculine (at least it&#x27;s not fruity!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo ingredients: Dl Water (Aqua), Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Sodium C14-16 Olefin Sulfonate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Cocamidopropyl Hydroxysultaine, Dimethicone Copolyol, Cocamide DEA, Glycol Distearate, Argania Spinoza Oil (Argan), Cacao Extract (Cocoa Butter), Parfum, Theobroma Cocos Nucifera Oil (Coconut), Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado), Aloe Barbadensis Extract (Aloe Leaf), Panthenol, Polyquaternium-11, DMDM Hydantoin, Cetyl Alcohol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, PEG-23M, Red 40, Yellow 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner: DI Water (Aqua), Behentrimonium Chloride, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycol Stearate, Glycerin, Dimethicone, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Parfum, Argania Spinoza Oil (Argan), Theobroma Cacao Extract (Cocoa Butter), Cocos Nucifera Oil (Coconut), Persea Gratissima Oil (Avocado), Aloe Barbadensis Extract (Aloe Leaf), Panthenol, Tetrasodium EDTA, DMDM Hydantoin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Red 40, Yellow 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penetrating Oil: Cyclopentasiloxane, Dimethicone, Cyclomethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Argania Spinoza Oil (Argan), Linum Usitatissimum Extract (Linseed), Parfum, Yellow 11, Red 17.</li>
    <li> I love the hair oil and the way it makes my hair feel it does not feel heavy or greasy and the smell is wonderful</li>
    <li> These products are excellent. The shampoo and conditioner work wonders (as well as having a very pleasing scent) but the real treasure is the oil. I leave it in my hair and it is soft and silk in a way it never has been before. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The whole system made my hair softer but The shampoo seems like it stripped it out.  It dried my hair so badly that i need to use the conditioner and the oil.</li>
    <li> I do think my hair is smoother, but not super silky.  I also like that the serum doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down; however, there are still a couple of flyaways.  I have naturally wavy hair that I have to flat iron straight every day.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think it is really color safe.  Usually none of my color washes out with conditioner, this one does.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner set for a while and loved the way it makes my hair feel and look. I loved the fact it had natural ingredients including argan oil, cocoa butter extract, coconut oil, avocado oil, aloe extract. Now they have gotten rid of all of the natural ingredients and have replaced them with chemicals! Don&#x27;t believe it? Compare your old bottle to a new one. The new chemicals even include dimethicone! I feel ripped off big time. I&#x27;m posting this same review on several websites to spread the word. I&#x27;m sick of companies thinking their customers are too ignorant to even notice. SPREAD THE WORD!</li>
    <li> First off this smells soooo good!(: being a mixed girl of black and white I have naturally really curly hair and this stuff makes it soo soft and its organic so that makes it even better(:</li>
    <li> The product is really nice.has my hair feeling really soft smells great and the packaging is just really so cute.</li>
    <li> Ok it got this last week and i used on Saturday. Well after a three day used my hair never look better. It feels amazing its soft and silky and I am so in love with this product.</li>
    <li> This is by far, the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used and my hair feels and looks better than it has ever been in years even after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought the shampoo only for my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day but she never really used it so I decided to try it out. After the first use, my hair feels noticeably softer and shinier. This was contradictory to everything I&#x27;ve ever tried, most shampoos, even the salon ones, suck the life out of my hair after I use it, they feel course and dull. This was not the case with Organix, it actually made my hair softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for 3 days straight (I usually shampoo every other day). I decided to buy the Conditioner and Penetrating Oil. I usually never even buy the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s expensive getting all three, if you I use it reasonably, it would probably last me 2 months. This product changed the way I thought about drugstore brands. I never thought I could find something this good.</li>
    <li> Love it...used in my hair yesterday and now it is really feeling silky soft and smooth...lots of compliments recieved already at work about my hair</li>
