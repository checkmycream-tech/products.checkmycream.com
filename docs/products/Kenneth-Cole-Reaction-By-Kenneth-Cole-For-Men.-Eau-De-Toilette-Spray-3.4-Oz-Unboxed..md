### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is probably the best smelling cologne I have EVER smelled.</li>
      <li>And that is the best thing that a man can hear.</li>
      <li>This has to be one of the best  colognes for men out there.  </li>
      <li>The best I have found yet !!</li>
      <li>The product is excellent.</li>
      <li>Great discountred product!</li>
      <li>Plus it was a VERY good price.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
      <li>Now that I am in a dedicated relationship, I havent bought it in a while, but it smells great either way</li>
      <li>I think it works great for both day and night (though it&#x27;s probably \\&quot;meant\\&quot; just for the day according to the cologne professionals)</li>
      <li>The price on here was amazing !</li>
      <li>Just the kind of reaction you&#x27;d expect from using a great smelling cologne.</li>
      <li>he&#x27;s been wearing it for over 2 years, and I have yet to find anything that smells NEARLY as good.</li>
      <li>Amazon had the best price - even better than many fragrance sites that also included coupons.    </li>
      <li>The price is great and the bottle appears authentic but the scent is weaker than the kenneth cole reaction, eau de toilette 3.4 oz.</li>
      <li>I got this for my hubby for Christmas and we both love it!</li>
      <li>I decided to purchase this cologne because I liked the way it smelled.</li>
      <li>it is light, and I always get complimented on how good that I smell...</li>
      <li>The best thing about this cologne is its great to wear during the day for casual wear, but its incredible at night when you plan on getting close to someone.</li>
      <li>, it isn&#x27;t overwhelming</li>
      <li>Also almost forgot even if you just keep buying it in your local stores, one of the best things is this cologne is so affordable.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of Kenneth Cole Reaction in the morning.</li>
      <li>Starting with finding it, ordering, delivery and use, this has been a great experience and I will order again !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
      <li>Love the smell of Reaction.</li>
      <li>This just has a very clean and airy, yet citrus type of smell going for it.</li>
      <li>He always smells so good, and he also really likes!</li>
      <li>I was a skeptic and thought this wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as the Kenneth Cole reaction that you buy in a store</li>
      <li>Lets just say its nice to have the girls coming close, without having to do anything to great on my part, helps the confidence level to take other steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been buying Kenneth Coles Reaction for my husband for two years now and though he has tried others Reaction is the best hands down.</li>
      <li>I didnt care, the cologne was perfectly fine and the bottle wasn&#x27;t leaking or anything.  </li>
      <li>Luckily I found it here on Amazon for a much better price.</li>
      <li>Fantastic cologne that any man should have.  </li>
      <li>I like it because it&#x27;s light and almost fruity, but</li>
      <li>I tried colognes that were around $100 range that were nowhere near as good as this one.</li>
      <li>Very fresh clean smell.</li>
      <li>The best part is that , it doesn&#x27;t really hit your nose, but lingers on, wearing just about sufficiently to draw positive attraction when anyone is close enough.</li>
      <li>It was delivered fast and safely.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect, but it is the real thing.</li>
      <li>A strong , masculine essence made with some really exotic mixture of scents.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I think any guy who try this, and gets the genuine/fresh not expired product, will find a new favorite.</li>
      <li>Only thing there was no box, the bottle was just wrapped in tissue paper but that&#x27;s okay who needs a box anyways!</li>
      <li>It was a great price and got to be in just a few days.  </li>
      <li>When a girl I know has not smelled it for awhile, and I put it on, the girls notice real fast.</li>
      <li>this deal is one worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My boyfriend agrees as well--I&#x27;ve had him smell other ones many times to make sure he didn&#x27;t want to switch it up before I got him a refill, and he still insists on Kenneth Cole Reaction.</li>
      <li>Next to 212 I have never been more complimented on my choice of cologne by females then this cologne.</li>
      <li>This has become my current favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>If I could give it more than 5 stars, I totally would!</li>
      <li>I had another bottle of Reaction when I got this one and did a scent comparison of name brand vs what I was delivered and the result was the amazing scent I was used to was now marred by a sharp edge.</li>
      <li>that way if you get one online later you can tell if its genuine or expired cause you have the real one to compare to.</li>
      <li>(He was also VERY excited/</li>
      <li>- I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I was surprised it came with the box, I opened it and it was the real deal!  </li>
      <li>If you want a new favorite cologne this is it guys, i can tell from reading other reviews on here that the girls agree with me on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>actual like to wear this cologne now primarily for special occasions and not as a everyday wear type of cologne</li>
      <li>I recommend trying it in a big box store first, and once you get hooked get it cheaper online,</li>
      <li>I usually get girls coming a lot closer, get longer hugs, and can tell girls are just keeping close to smell the cologne/me :-).</li>
      <li>I still would definitely call it masculine; it&#x27;s a nice change to me from all the heavy, dark, musty smelling colognes that are out there.</li>
      <li>Not really for party scene, more like a cozy romantic dinner thing to wear.</li>
      <li>surprised that I got him the bigger bottle.)</li>
      <li>Seriously though, smells clean, not overpowering.</li>
      <li>Reaction smells subtly fruity - like sweet honey dew melon.</li>

<li> Some knockoffs have a different smell, and others which are past shelf life just don&#x27;t last longer then 15-30 minutes.</li>
<li> Quality made too as it lasts forever and you only need a little dab.</li>
<li> But it pretty expensive.</li>

<li> I have sworn by this cologne and used it for years and what I received was not what I have bought in years past.</li>
<li> Works every time without fail..</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve wanted to get this for my husband for some time, but it was always so expensive!</li>

    <li> I love the smell of Kenneth Cole Reaction in the morning. Smells like victory. Seriously though, smells clean, not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical to buy this large bottle of sweet smelling colgne for half the retail price.  It came and it was in a box and it was everything they had promised! I was surprised it came with the box, I opened it and it was the real deal!  I did notice that the actual bottle looked like it had been dropped or something because there were tiny imperfections on the bottle&#x27;s edges...that is why it was at a dicounted price perhaps. I didnt care, the cologne was perfectly fine and the bottle wasn&#x27;t leaking or anything.  Great discountred product!</li>
    <li> This is probably the best smelling cologne I have EVER smelled. I&#x27;ve been getting it for my boyfriend/he&#x27;s been wearing it for over 2 years, and I have yet to find anything that smells NEARLY as good. My boyfriend agrees as well--I&#x27;ve had him smell other ones many times to make sure he didn&#x27;t want to switch it up before I got him a refill, and he still insists on Kenneth Cole Reaction. I like it because it&#x27;s light and almost fruity, but I still would definitely call it masculine; it&#x27;s a nice change to me from all the heavy, dark, musty smelling colognes that are out there. I think it works great for both day and night (though it&#x27;s probably \\&quot;meant\\&quot; just for the day according to the cologne professionals), it isn&#x27;t overwhelming but you can definitely smell it (I would call it \\&quot;bright,\\&quot; almost, if that makes sense), and you can&#x27;t beat the prices they have on Amazon on the larger bottle! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I totally would!</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this cologne because I liked the way it smelled. But it pretty expensive. Luckily I found it here on Amazon for a much better price. My girlfriend loves it! Every time we hug and I&#x27;m wearing it, she can&#x27;t help but smell my neck. Just the kind of reaction you&#x27;d expect from using a great smelling cologne.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent. It was delivered fast and safely. I wasn&#x27;t quite sure what to expect, but it is the real thing. Starting with finding it, ordering, delivery and use, this has been a great experience and I will order again !!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of Reaction. Plus it was a VERY good price. I used to pay over 100.00 dollars a bottle, NOT ANYMORE!!!</li>
    <li> This has to be one of the best  colognes for men out there.  The fragrance has a citrus and apple smell to it.</li>
    <li> Im not a big cologne man, but when i do I wear this scent...it is light, and I always get complimented on how good that I smell...And that is the best thing that a man can hear. Would you rather hear, eeeww[...] smells?</li>
    <li> Fantastic cologne that any man should have.  My husband has been wearing it for a long time and I joke that he always gets \\&quot;a reaction\\&quot; from it.  Quality made too as it lasts forever and you only need a little dab.</li>
    <li> The price is great and the bottle appears authentic but the scent is weaker than the kenneth cole reaction, eau de toilette 3.4 oz. that I previously purchased at the leading department stores.</li>
    <li> I was a skeptic and thought this wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as the Kenneth Cole reaction that you buy in a store but I took it to a shop in the mall and two managers said the smell was identical to their tester in their shop.  It was a great price and got to be in just a few days.  Only thing there was no box, the bottle was just wrapped in tissue paper but that&#x27;s okay who needs a box anyways!</li>
    <li> I had another bottle of Reaction when I got this one and did a scent comparison of name brand vs what I was delivered and the result was the amazing scent I was used to was now marred by a sharp edge. I have sworn by this cologne and used it for years and what I received was not what I have bought in years past.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. A strong , masculine essence made with some really exotic mixture of scents. The best part is that , it doesn&#x27;t really hit your nose, but lingers on, wearing just about sufficiently to draw positive attraction when anyone is close enough. Not really for party scene, more like a cozy romantic dinner thing to wear. Would definitely purchase again, especially considering the price for which i get it !!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. It smells yummy to me. Very fresh clean smell.</li>
    <li> I had been getting the small bottle for the same price in the store...this deal is one worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Kenneth Coles Reaction for my husband for two years now and though he has tried others Reaction is the best hands down. The scent lasts the day, but is not to overpowering. He is asked often what he is wearing by men and women. The price on here was amazing ! The best I have found yet !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to get this for my husband for some time, but it was always so expensive! Well, I wanted to get it for him for Valentine&#x27;s Day, and I found it here on Amazon for a fraction of the cost! Came without a box, but was well packaged with tons of bubble wrap for protection. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> This has become my current favorite cologne. Been using this for over 3+ years now. This just has a very clean and airy, yet citrus type of smell going for it. The best thing about this cologne is its great to wear during the day for casual wear, but its incredible at night when you plan on getting close to someone. Next to 212 I have never been more complimented on my choice of cologne by females then this cologne. Even some guys (which I never met before) are like, hey what are you wearing, and where can I buy that.If you want a new favorite cologne this is it guys, i can tell from reading other reviews on here that the girls agree with me on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actual like to wear this cologne now primarily for special occasions and not as a everyday wear type of cologne, cause I don&#x27;t like to wear it out. When a girl I know has not smelled it for awhile, and I put it on, the girls notice real fast. I usually get girls coming a lot closer, get longer hugs, and can tell girls are just keeping close to smell the cologne/me :-). Lets just say its nice to have the girls coming close, without having to do anything to great on my part, helps the confidence level to take other steps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think any guy who try this, and gets the genuine/fresh not expired product, will find a new favorite. Some knockoffs have a different smell, and others which are past shelf life just don&#x27;t last longer then 15-30 minutes. I recommend trying it in a big box store first, and once you get hooked get it cheaper online, that way if you get one online later you can tell if its genuine or expired cause you have the real one to compare to. Also almost forgot even if you just keep buying it in your local stores, one of the best things is this cologne is so affordable. I tried colognes that were around $100 range that were nowhere near as good as this one.</li>

Amazon had the best price - even better than many fragrance sites that also included coupons.    Reaction smells subtly fruity - like sweet honey dew melon. Yum!</li>
    <li> Wanna be a &amp;#34;lady killer&amp;#34;? This is the stuff for you. Works every time without fail.. Now that I am in a dedicated relationship, I havent bought it in a while, but it smells great either way - I highly recommend this product!</li>
