      <li>I love it, but the picky Bride felt it didn&#x27;t match her ensemble.</li>
      <li>Thank you for such as awesome product:)</li>
      <li>but they are so cute.</li>
      <li>cute hair pins.  </li>
      <li>These are nice, but the picture doesn&#x27;t give a full and accurate impression of what they look like.</li>
      <li>I think one or two of the flowers did break off at some point throughout the night and one pin did fall out of my hair, but they did their job of looking pretty for pictures and most of the night!</li>
      <li>but They actually look better lol..</li>
      <li>pins worked fine to hold an up-do for wedding.</li>
      <li>My sister has fine hair</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m planning to use them to secure my veil, and for that purpose, I think they&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
      <li>Great buy and very simple!!!</li>
      <li>Perfect, not cheap.</li>
      <li>The picture was nice, but it is much nicer in person!&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are a great size and the jewel in the middle</li>
      <li>Pretty long for a child but perfect for a bride!</li>
      <li>These dainty, beautifully detailed flowers look like the real thing without being fragile or perishable.</li>
      <li>I was not even able to save them with hot glue.  </li>
      <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
      <li>They are very pretty and worked well for my daughter (who was a flower girl).  </li>
      <li>Very pretty, can&#x27;t wait to wear in 18 days.</li>
      <li>They were sweetly packaged and have just the right amount of sparkle to them.</li>
      <li>The petals are cut acrylic with white paint underneath, so they won&#x27;t look as good close up as they do from far away</li>
      <li>I had them in my bridal hair and the hair-maker was impressed how simple yet these little flowers were!</li>
      <li>Much prettier than in the photo!</li>
      <li>Pretty</li>
      <li>I did my friend&#x27;s hair for her wedding and these made for a lovely final touch.</li>
      <li>They sparkle so much!</li>
      <li>Only thing I might add is you want to make sure you pinch the ends otherwise</li>
      <li>These looked so pretty in my daughters hair on her communion day, but 90% of them broke by the end of the day</li>
      <li>Evidently someone else did to, had them stolen off of everyones luggage on our trip.</li>
      <li>then that, they are pretty in your hair.</li>
      <li>However, they&#x27;re attractive and delicate.</li>
      <li>I looked so pretty in these hair pins.</li>
      <li>These are adorable, but they are very fragile.</li>
      <li>so it looks better quality and prettier which is not so much the same with he real thing.</li>
      <li>pure trash do not buy this.</li>
      <li>Just be careful because they are delicate, but on a special occasion they will be beautiful.</li>
      <li>as well which was an absolute bonus.</li>
      <li>These are really preaty hair pins...</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m going to have to super glue it back on...</li>
      <li>would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty and delicate without being over the top and they stayed in all night.</li>
      <li>I LOVE these little things !</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend these for any special occasion that you may need some extra pizazz.</li>
      <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
      <li>These actually look much nicer in person than in the photo.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that the pin part that you stick in the hair was a bit long....which would be fine for people with long or think hair, but trickier to hide with fine hair.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re pretty but need to be careful with them.</li>
      <li>The white paint is on the underside of clear thick plastic petals, so the flowers have a lot more shine and depth than I had expected.</li>
      <li>These acrylic flowers are mostly white with a clear stripe through them and gem in the middle.</li>
      <li>These hair pins are very pretty and delicate....</li>

<li> These are very pretty but the pin legs are way too long and several of the pinheads broke off after just a few hours of being part of my wedding hair style.</li>

    <li> Love these clips. Ordered them for my sons wedding. They are made really well and looked beautiful</li>
    <li> A bit transparent than the picture tho, but they were great.Very Strong, and very beautiful. Great buy and very simple!!!</li>
    <li> I did my friend&#x27;s hair for her wedding and these made for a lovely final touch. They&#x27;re pretty and delicate without being over the top and they stayed in all night.</li>
    <li> These are very pretty but the pin legs are way too long and several of the pinheads broke off after just a few hours of being part of my wedding hair style. Not impressed with the quality but they did the trick.</li>
    <li> So cute! These acrylic flowers are mostly white with a clear stripe through them and gem in the middle. They look great and were beautiful for my wedding. I think one or two of the flowers did break off at some point throughout the night and one pin did fall out of my hair, but they did their job of looking pretty for pictures and most of the night!</li>
    <li> Pretty but the pins themselves were way too long</li>
    <li> Nice and well made for the price.</li>
    <li> These are really preaty hair pins... Looking forward to use them for a wedding hair do.  No damage on them when received.</li>
    <li> Am very happy with order</li>
    <li> The prongs are extremely long that they poke your head!  Other then that, they are pretty in your hair.</li>
    <li> This Flower Bridal Hairpin did not meet my expectations. They are so tiny, they are plastic and they look inferior. I feel cheated for the amount I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I had been searching for a floral element to incorporate in my hairdo for prom, and these did just the trick. They didn&#x27;t fall out, and i got compliments on them all night. The seller actually gave me 7 instead of 6 as well which was an absolute bonus. I would definitely recommend these for any special occasion that you may need some extra pizazz.</li>
    <li> Looks good but pricey</li>
    <li> Two came broken (flowers detached from the pins), one broke (petal chipped off) as I took it out of the bag.  Very fragile.  Order extra if you need to use all 8 pieces.  They&#x27;re pretty but need to be careful with them.</li>
    <li> These hair pins are very pretty and delicate.... Can&#x27;t wait to wear them for wedding... They are the perfect size and look like real flowers..</li>
    <li> I love it, but the picky Bride felt it didn&#x27;t match her ensemble.</li>
    <li> Much prettier than in the photo! Perfect for brides and bridesmaids.  It would be nice if they offered the pins in brown for darker hair too.</li>
    <li> Gorgeous,  gorgeous,  gorgeous!</li>
    <li> My Niece wore these to her prom and they were great!  She loved them!</li>
    <li> Excelent product:thanks</li>
    <li> They are beautiful I can not wait to wear them!!! Just be careful because they are delicate, but on a special occasion they will be beautiful.</li>
    <li> These looked so pretty in my daughters hair on her communion day, but 90% of them broke by the end of the day (the flower popped off the pin).  If you only need them once, go ahead and purchase but buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to wear in my hair for my wedding.  First they arrived and one was already broken.  Then they fell apart while putting them in my hair. They were not worth the price.  I was not even able to save them with hot glue.  I sent them back after being bitterly disappointed.</li>
    <li> These are as prettly as pictured. What impressed me is how durable they are. Only been a few weeks wearing them though. Will update on how well they are holding up.</li>
    <li> The picture was nice, but it is much nicer in person!&lt;br /&gt;The quality is nice and very beautiful. It will look nice on my wedding day!</li>
    <li> Beautiful,  very delicate looking!!!!!!</li>
    <li> These pins are very nice. I bought them for my wedding and I was pleasantly surprised.  The picture doesn&#x27;t give them justice.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> cute hair pins.  Went well with the up doo&#x27;s.  Made to last not cheap looking at all.  Very nice for a wedding updo!</li>
    <li> Love them! Evidently someone else did to, had them stolen off of everyones luggage on our trip.</li>
    <li> the publication is ambiguous, in the pictures is shown a mesh for hair but then this is not included, NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASE</li>
    <li> These are absolutely perfect for my wedding day. Beautiful! I&#x27;m the bride, and can&#x27;t wait to wear these! Expensive look for a very reasonable price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, can&#x27;t wait to wear in 18 days. One of the flowers fell off so I&#x27;m going to have to super glue it back on...</li>
    <li> Lovely, don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase</li>
    <li> These dainty, beautifully detailed flowers look like the real thing without being fragile or perishable. I am looking forward to wearing them.</li>
    <li> I wore these in my hair during my beach wedding on Oahu. They were perfect.</li>
    <li> Product was sturdy a little smaller than expected</li>
    <li> They are very pretty and worked well for my daughter (who was a flower girl).  My only complaint is that the pin part that you stick in the hair was a bit long....which would be fine for people with long or think hair, but trickier to hide with fine hair.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but beautifully presented in box. They are nicer then in the picture.</li>
    <li> Loved these!! Got them to wear on my wedding day...they stayed in all day and night...especially with being an outside wedding to boot!!</li>
    <li> These are beautiful!  I bought them for my 3.5yr olds baptism. They are about 1.5in long. Pretty long for a child but perfect for a bride! They sparkle so much!</li>
    <li> the flowers broke as i was putting them in. pure trash do not buy this. i got this for a wedding and within a half hour they were all broken. waste of money and wayyy overpriced.</li>
    <li> These actually look much nicer in person than in the photo. They were sweetly packaged and have just the right amount of sparkle to them. The white paint is on the underside of clear thick plastic petals, so the flowers have a lot more shine and depth than I had expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful wedding! I looked so pretty in these hair pins. Thank you for such as awesome product:)</li>
    <li> beautiful, wore for my wedding by the end of the night all of the flowers had fallen off the pin - good for one wear only</li>
    <li> These are BEAUTIFUL picture does not do them justice!</li>
    <li> The color is not so white, the material for the flowers are clear color with white painted on the bottom side, so when you look at it from different angles its not white, the picture is taking from the front of it and with black back ground so it looks better quality and prettier which is not so much the same with he real thing.</li>
    <li> These are nice, but the picture doesn&#x27;t give a full and accurate impression of what they look like. The petals are cut acrylic with white paint underneath, so they won&#x27;t look as good close up as they do from far away; also, there were a few minor flaws. However, they&#x27;re attractive and delicate. I&#x27;m planning to use them to secure my veil, and for that purpose, I think they&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
    <li> These are adorable, but they are very fragile. I had to glue some of them back together.</li>
    <li> I ordered these to wear at my wedding and they arrived fast and looked GREAT!! I was a little bit disappointed in how many bobby pins it took my hair dresser to hold them in place but they worked!!</li>
    <li> I paid $20 for 6 clips and was disappointed to find they are incredibly cheap and several were broken upon arrival.  I&#x27;d say these should retail for no more than $3 - $4 per set.  I&#x27;m clearly a sucker in this case.</li>
    <li> These are so beautiful in person!  The white is not so opaque as the picture makes it look.  They are a great size and the jewel in the middle makes them sparkle.  Can&#x27;t wait to wear these on my wedding day in October!</li>
    <li> I had them in my bridal hair and the hair-maker was impressed how simple yet these little flowers were! They looked gorgeous in my hair!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my sisters prom, and this picture doesn&#x27;t do them any justice. They are incredibly beautiful. My sister has fine hair so she did have to keep poking a few of the flowers back in. But other than that we have no complaints</li>
    <li> good value.  pins worked fine to hold an up-do for wedding.</li>
    <li> They look NOTHING like the picture lol but they are so cute. I bought them for my nieces XV party. I thought the flowers were paper looking with a diamond in the middle but They actually look better lol.. They look glass like (but its actually plastic) with a diamond in the middle... I LOVE these little things !</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product!</li>
    <li> I just received the same identical product from ebay, the difference is the PRICE!  I got 20 pieces for $5.95!</li>
    <li> So cute! Perfect, not cheap. Love them! I got these for my wedding and I was not disappointed. Very nice quality and the price even better!</li>
    <li> This was a perfect hair accessory for my wedding Up-D. Gave it great touch to my wedding up-do. Loved it.</li>
    <li> Got these for my daughter&#x27;s hair for her Maui wedding.  Only thing I might add is you want to make sure you pinch the ends otherwise they&#x27;ll fall out.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these bobby pins!!  I just had my trial run for my wedding and the hairdresser put these in my hair and they are gorgeous!!  Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> They were all broke when I got them</li>
