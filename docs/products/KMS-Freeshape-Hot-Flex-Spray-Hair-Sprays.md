<li> I usually by this at Ulta</li>
<li> Seriously does wonders for my texture hair.</li>
<li> Even works on very thick hair.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too expensive.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works pretty well to hold style without any hard feel when used with heat.</li>
    <li> I have almost waist length layered straight hair that is balayaged/ombre. I read the reviews and since nothing helps my curling iron induced waves keep their curl for long at all I thought I&#x27;d try it. It does help a great deal for me as in 2 to 3 days vs. 1. I do feel it drys my hair out though which is a little disconcerting. My hair is a natural level 4 and with all the balayage/ombre treatments to get it light in the layers it worries me a bit that it&#x27;s drying since I&#x27;ve managed to keep my hair fairly healthy through the balayge/ombre lightening. That is why 4 stars and not 5. Since I only wash my hair every 5 days with dry shampoo on day 4 I may buy again. I&#x27;ll wait and see as I&#x27;ve used it only 4 times thus far.</li>
    <li> KMS knocks another one out of the park. Several pumps of this on damp hair, combined with a quality blow-dry, works wonders. This product gives hair a nice healthy shine and seems to prevent frizz from forming after blow-drying. I use this when I style my hair into a quiff or pomp, and it really helps boost the volume. Fantastic item.</li>
    <li> nice product, skeptical at first but it ceased the damaging already done to my hair before I used the spray</li>
    <li> Good stuff..have been using it for years for styimg my hair.  My hairdresser uses it on my as well.</li>
    <li> Great product to use with hot rollers or curling iron.  Helps hold your curls without being sticky, even in high humidity. Even works on very thick hair.</li>
    <li> I will order this again and again!  My hair is slightly longer than chin-length and in a bob style.  I can literally go 2-3 days after styling and not have to do anything to my hair.  Definitely holds the shape, and makes my hair look smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> Got this stuff in my birchbox a few months ago and found it on here a little cheaper.  Great for holding curl, in hair that loves to be straight!</li>
    <li> i really think this doesn&#x27;t do anything at all</li>
    <li> Works well. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a staple item everyday it seems a bit sticky built up but will get the job done when you need it to hold a style.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use before curling and blow drying to hold style and protect from heat.  Fresh smell.</li>
    <li> This works great for the whole day and keeps your hairs shine definitely going to buy it again for sure</li>
    <li> Love this spray.  It does wonders as far as heat protection and styling. It really makes my frizzy curly hair blow out into softer bouncy waves (with the use of a good blow dryer and round brush) that stay intact for a couple of days. Seriously does wonders for my texture hair. Just wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy it every few weeks. It&#x27;s too expensive. I continue to look for comparable products that are less costly but have not yet found one. Will keep you posted when I do.</li>
    <li> Awesome for South Carolina humidity!</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT---THIS OUR 2ND OR 3RD PURCHASE AND WILL BE PURCHASING MORE.</li>
    <li> Helps curl and hold curls great! Recommended by my hair stylist!</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the results. Just need to apply few squirts and blow-dry. DON&#x27;T need to use the flat iron. Good for the whole day!!</li>

    <li> I ordered this spray because my hairdresser recommended it. The one I received, however, did not have a functioning top so I ended up tossing it out. I have yet to know if it would have served my purpose.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair care product....</li>
