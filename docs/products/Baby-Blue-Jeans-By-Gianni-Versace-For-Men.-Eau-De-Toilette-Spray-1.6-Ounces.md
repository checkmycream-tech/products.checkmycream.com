    <li> I recieved this as a gift when my son was born..It was his first cologne...I would spray it on my hands and rub on his clothes. As he got older he wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without a spritz of his cologne, like Daddy :} I now have a Grandson and purchased it for him...he always smells sooo sweet! Lots of compliments...</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Only bad part was the packing material was rather sparse. Everything arrived fine, but was rolling around in the box.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Great product for a great price the  cologne comes packaged nicy for gift giving my son loved it</li>
    <li> Some colognes are overwhelming or cheap smelling or just too sweet. This product has an elegant masculine smell to it at a reasonable price. It&#x27;s my favorite fragrance by far.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this spray for men.  I love the way it smells on him.  It was delivered within three weeks of ordering.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.  Time to order more.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a Great product for a great price, my son loved it</li>
    <li> this is best one my husband has ever used. i love the smell and stays almost 10-12 hrs. best buy for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a woman who wears this.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  The shipping was super fast and I would definately buy from this seller again.  My husband loved the product because it smells awesome.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas. I bought it on a whim without having smelled it before. This cologne has an herbal smell to it, but is light and fresh. It is not one of my favorites, but it does smell ok. Definitely not the worst that I have smelled. I am pleased with the purchase and hubby was happy with it.</li>
    <li> I DO NOT like Baby Blue Jeans by Versace for Men at all...&lt;br /&gt;TOO STRONG of a Lemoneey mixed w/ Baby Powder type of smell. (smells like Lemon Pledge u use to clean with).&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I did was because I wanted to TRY it out and the Price was good at around $13 bucks on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest you PASS on this one.&lt;br /&gt;You will not be satisfied....I wasn&#x27;t anyway&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t believe me......try for yourself !  ; )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P. S.  If you want to try a decent cologne by Versace go with BLUE JEANS....thats a classic and its a decent price on Amazon at around $20 for a 2.5oz bottle.</li>
    <li> Baby blue jeans is a fresh lemmon and baby powder scent. After is settles it becomes smooth. Versus is a versace brand. It just so happens that this brand was switches over to versace&#x27;s versus lable.  You cant go wrong. You only live once</li>
    <li> This cologne, if that&#x27;s what you want to call it is horrible.  It smells like a bathroom cleaner. I sprayed on my wrist once and had to wash it off because it was making me sick to my stomach. DO NOT PURCHASE!!! listen to all the bad reviews.</li>
    <li> I am living NYC. I got it fast. I really like it and I recommend it... Not expensive. Wish you like it...</li>
    <li> This is packaged very well.  The smell is almost a baby powder fresh smell, but with additional fragrance&#x27;s that make it very special.  Additional bonus is this scent lasts almost all day without being overpowering when first applied.</li>
    <li> This is the same cologne that i would use as a baby, now i can use it again, and/or give it as a gift my kids</li>
    <li> muy buena calidad excelente el envio, muy rápido el despacho el vendedor muy bueno todo muy bien felicitaciones sigan asi saludos</li>
    <li> suckS!!!! SMELLS BAD &#x3D;( COULD NOT  EVEN RETURN IT  WAS A WASTE OF MONEY BIG TIME SMELL OLD. no good</li>
