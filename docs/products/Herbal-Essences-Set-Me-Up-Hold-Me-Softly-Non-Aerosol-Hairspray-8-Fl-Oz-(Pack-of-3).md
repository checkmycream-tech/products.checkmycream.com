      <li>It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t add weight or stiffness, but it holds hair in place.</li>
      <li>This product works great.</li>
      <li>All of their products are fantastic!!!</li>

      <li>Great Price Great Seller Thanks</li>
      <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>I love this hairspray.  </li>
      <li>&gt; Love it and will buy it from now on.  </li>
      <li>So many products make my head itch, Herbal Essences is a product that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I love the smell and</li>
      <li>Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
      <li>The smell is just ok though.</li>
      <li>Good hairspray for a decent price.</li>
      <li>I used this product before they took it off the market, it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s back.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a good product that you can find in most retail stores (Walmart, Walgreens, etc), but Amazon prices it right and free shipping makes for shopping convenience.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s hold and looks great all day long.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find this at my local grocery store anymore, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, too.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective batch of three bottles with my Subscribe and Save because other reviews here were good.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes, the shampoos are so strongly scented and compliment my soap so much that I actually skip wearing perfume.  :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll try a different brand and try to find one more reliable.</li>
      <li>This is a good hairspray with a pretty stiff hold, just as the label describes.  </li>
      <li>So far, the pump hasn&#x27;t clogged after using half the product, always happy with that in a pump dispenser.</li>
      <li>I used to use Herbal Essences hairspray, but that had a hard time finding it in stock, so tried a variety of cheap hair sprays, all of which did a better job than these bottles I got from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
      <li>I really need this</li>
      <li>But the hair spray seems really watery to me.  </li>
      <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t result in any flakiness in your hair and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch the way some inexpensive products do.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I live in a tropical climate and it&#x27;s very windy.  </li>
      <li>I use a super wide tooth comb first, then brush without any hair breakage.  </li>
      <li>Recommend Highly</li>
      <li>I use it everyday before going to the gym and it works ok.  </li>
      <li>Other reviewers commented about this products fresh fragrance, but I don&#x27;t really smell much of a fragrance at all.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t opened the new bottles that I received.  </li>
      <li>First, I got hooked on the shampoos, then today, I tried the hairspray and this stuff actually works.</li>
      <li>I read online of a study completed on hairspray and they listed the top 5, of which HE TMS hairspray was one of the big 5 - comparing to other brands in the $15+ range.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so sad that it&#x27;s not as good as I remember it, unless these were just defective watered-down bottles.  </li>
      <li>however, my hair is not stiff with extra hold hairspray.  </li>
      <li>Just now starting to discover that Herbal Essences products just aren&#x27;t for young kids or women in their 20s.  </li>
      <li>I also really like the way it smells vs. other hair sprays.</li>
      <li>Big fan of Herbal Essences, in general!</li>
      <li>It really weighs my hair down like water and has no hold whatsoever.  </li>

<li> Big fan of Herbal Essences, in general!</li>
<li> It really weighs my hair down like water and has no hold whatsoever.  </li>
<li> It holds well, isn&#x27;t heavy in the slightest, your hair moves naturally, and I can use my hands to shake it out at night without any breakage or tugging of the hair.  </li>
<li> what I like about the smell is that you don&#x27;t smell it all day, especially if it gets wet!</li>
<li> It caused  build up that other sprays have not.</li>
<li> My other bottles of hairspray are not holding my hair in place...</li>
<li> Hold firm enough without looking stiff.</li>
<li> As noted, the hold is stiff, so getting a brush through your hair at night takes a little effort.  </li>
<li> , is too heavy on your hair, your hair moves stiffly as you walk or the wind catches it, or you can&#x27;t run your fingers through your it at the end of the day.  </li>
<li> Very little goes</li>
<li> I hate that!</li>

    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Better price with subscribe and save than any retail store even if you have a coupon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective batch of three bottles with my Subscribe and Save because other reviews here were good.  But the hair spray seems really watery to me.  It really weighs my hair down like water and has no hold whatsoever.  It also had no smell, which made me also think it was too watery.  I used to use Herbal Essences hairspray, but that had a hard time finding it in stock, so tried a variety of cheap hair sprays, all of which did a better job than these bottles I got from Amazon.  I&#x27;m so sad that it&#x27;s not as good as I remember it, unless these were just defective watered-down bottles.  Still, I cancelled and will not purchase again. I&#x27;ll try a different brand and try to find one more reliable.</li>
    <li> This product works just like the bottle says \\&quot;extra hold\\&quot;.  Spray on in the morning and hair keeps it&#x27;s hold and looks great all day long.  I love this hairspray.  I live in a tropical climate and it&#x27;s very windy.  This product works great.</li>
    <li> I can never find this in the store anymore! Only in aerosols and I&#x27;m not a fan of that.  I love the smell and what I like about the smell is that you don&#x27;t smell it all day, especially if it gets wet! I hate that!</li>
    <li> My other bottles of hairspray are not holding my hair in place...however, my hair is not stiff with extra hold hairspray.  I haven&#x27;t opened the new bottles that I received.  Hope they will do the job!</li>
    <li> I use it everyday before going to the gym and it works ok.  It helps to hold my hair given that I work out a lot</li>
    <li> This product did not work well on my hair. It caused  build up that other sprays have not. I had to use a clarifying rinse to get it out.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences Set Me Up Extra Hold&lt;br /&gt;Hairspray 8 Fl oz I like this product after fix my hair I really need this</li>
    <li> Great Price Great Seller Thanks</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I read online of a study completed on hairspray and they listed the top 5, of which HE TMS hairspray was one of the big 5 - comparing to other brands in the $15+ range.  My problem with hairspray is it either doesn&#x27;t hold, is too heavy on your hair, your hair moves stiffly as you walk or the wind catches it, or you can&#x27;t run your fingers through your it at the end of the day.  This spray doesn&#x27;t do any of that.  It holds well, isn&#x27;t heavy in the slightest, your hair moves naturally, and I can use my hands to shake it out at night without any breakage or tugging of the hair.  Recommend Highly</li>
    <li> I used this product before they took it off the market, it&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s back.  So many products make my head itch, Herbal Essences is a product that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold at all,  as advertised it would. Now I have 3 bottles of hairspray that don&#x27;t work. I really wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Just now starting to discover that Herbal Essences products just aren&#x27;t for young kids or women in their 20s.  First, I got hooked on the shampoos, then today, I tried the hairspray and this stuff actually works. Very little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, too. Actually, all herbal essences products do.  Sometimes, the shampoos are so strongly scented and compliment my soap so much that I actually skip wearing perfume.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Love it and will buy it from now on.  Big fan of Herbal Essences, in general!</li>
    <li> All of their products are fantastic!!! What else can I say!!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair spray ever! It&#x27;s great because it doesn&#x27;t add weight or stiffness, but it holds hair in place. I also really like the way it smells vs. other hair sprays. I can&#x27;t find this at my local grocery store anymore, so it&#x27;s nice to be able to order it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> great! Everyone always compliments the way my hair smells.  I&#x27;ve used this prodict for years.  I reccommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Holds great and does not harden on your hair which I love! It also does not leave a residue on your hair.</li>
    <li> The best hairspray you can buy.  Hold firm enough without looking stiff.</li>
    <li> This is a good hairspray with a pretty stiff hold, just as the label describes.

Overall, this is a good product that you can find in most retail stores (Walmart, Walgreens, etc), but Amazon prices it right and free shipping makes for shopping convenience.</li>
    <li> Good hairspray for a decent price. The smell is just ok though. It works for what I need so I&#x27;ll probably buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hairspray and for the price it&#x27;s a bargain, which helps with my budget. Saves me time and gas getting it online.  Thanks</li>
