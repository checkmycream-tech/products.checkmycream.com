      <li>This my new favorite nail color!  </li>
      <li>This is probably my new favorite!</li>
      <li>Nice polish very pretty and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>First of all, I have never had a nail polish that went on my nails as easily and smoothly as this one.</li>
      <li>I know that most of us are trying to get away from certain ingredients</li>
      <li>Need to do at least 3-4 coats to get great color!</li>
      <li>Holographic shimmer really stands out after top coat.</li>
      <li>In some lights this color looks like a light gray but is a pretty buff/nude color in others.</li>
      <li>Lovin&#x27; version of this polish and liked the effects which were much more subtle and sophisticated than glitter.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s neutral enough to wear to the office, but so much shimmer its gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>So pretty.</li>
      <li>Its staying power is comparable to the brands listed above (maybe slightly better).</li>
      <li>Sooo pretty.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m in my 60s now,and I don&#x27;t worry about that -- much.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>i find that one thin coat then a second thicker is best.  </li>
      <li>I will keep mixing and matching various types of polish, base coats and top coats and experimenting for the best results.</li>
      <li>I have many OPI, China Glaze, Zoya nail polishes and a few really expensive ones (Chanel, Givenchy), and KBShimmer is superior to all of them in the way the polish goes on nails.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried this polish as a single thin coat over OPI&#x27;s Dulce de Leche to warm up the color, and that works very well.  </li>
      <li>In Bare Form holographic nail polish.</li>

<li> Goes on smooth and with a few coats you get a subtle and classy look!</li>

<li> taking a long time to write this because i keep pausing to stare at my nails!</li>
<li> i&#x27;m not particular about VNL</li>
<li> However, this nail polish does take a little long to dry.</li>
<li> Color is very subtle with high shimmer!  </li>
<li> love it, I received a lot of compliments, Use a base coat 1st, then 2-3 coats of color</li>
<li> Maybe that&#x27;s because my pale skin has a peach/rose undertone.  </li>
<li> The color is supposed to be a pale golden/nude, I guess, but it tends to look almost a silvered beige.</li>
<li> The clear base coat that went on my bare nails was an older Sally Hansen treatment called &amp;#34;Miracle Cure&amp;#34;, rather than the newer Sally Hansen moisturizing &amp;#34;4 in 1&amp;#34;, since using the newer base under the Lava color didn&#x27;t work out as well.  </li>
<li> Subtle shimmer nude.  </li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at the Holographic KBShimmer nail polishes for a while now, and finally decided to give it a try. I am glad that I did! First of all, I have never had a nail polish that went on my nails as easily and smoothly as this one. It truly feels like butter when I paint my nails with it! The consistency of the formula is wonderful. I love how shimmery my nails look with just one coat of this nail polish! I am attaching pictures of my nails with 2 coats of KBShimmer In Bare Form holographic nail polish. I have many OPI, China Glaze, Zoya nail polishes and a few really expensive ones (Chanel, Givenchy), and KBShimmer is superior to all of them in the way the polish goes on nails. Its staying power is comparable to the brands listed above (maybe slightly better). However, this nail polish does take a little long to dry.</li>
    <li> The color is to light</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail and tried it immediately!  I am in love with it!  I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a holographic nude nail polish for a long time now and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to get.  So doing my research I came across this beauty and I love it!  Definitely buying this again.  100% recommend it! : &amp;#62;</li>
    <li> So pretty. I love it.</li>
    <li> Nice polish very pretty and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is from Mrs. K. L., not J.L. (We share an account.  He doesn&#x27;t wear polish, BTW.)  I&#x27;d tried the Lava Lovin&#x27; version of this polish and liked the effects which were much more subtle and sophisticated than glitter.  I gave this one a shot, and it has some interesting possibilities.  The color is supposed to be a pale golden/nude, I guess, but it tends to look almost a silvered beige. Maybe that&#x27;s because my pale skin has a peach/rose undertone.  I&#x27;ve tried this polish as a single thin coat over OPI&#x27;s Dulce de Leche to warm up the color, and that works very well.  The clear base coat that went on my bare nails was an older Sally Hansen treatment called &amp;#34;Miracle Cure&amp;#34;, rather than the newer Sally Hansen moisturizing &amp;#34;4 in 1&amp;#34;, since using the newer base under the Lava color didn&#x27;t work out as well.  This combination stayed on much better than the KBS Lava Lovin&#x27; did (see separate review of that color). I know that most of us are trying to get away from certain ingredients but I&#x27;m in my 60s now,and I don&#x27;t worry about that -- much.  I will keep mixing and matching various types of polish, base coats and top coats and experimenting for the best results. Suggestions for further experimentation with nail colors and treatments are of course welcome in the form of comments to this review.</li>
    <li> This is a unique, but beautiful !! love it, I received a lot of compliments, Use a base coat 1st, then 2-3 coats of color, then a top coat&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> Perfect neutral color and beautiful shimmer</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this polish.  i&#x27;m wearing it for the second time in two weeks. it goes with everything and every time i wear it, i love it more.  i usually put bright colors on my toes and this is the perfect compliment to everything. i find that one thin coat then a second thicker is best.  i&#x27;m not particular about VNL so two is enough for me.  taking a long time to write this because i keep pausing to stare at my nails!</li>
    <li> Love this brand! In some lights this color looks like a light gray but is a pretty buff/nude color in others. Holographic shimmer really stands out after top coat. I like this brand of polish better than some of my high-cost name brand polishes.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Loooove the shimmer and shine!! You will have to apply it in 2-3 coats to get the full effect, but once done, it looks gorgeous. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This my new favorite nail color!  It&#x27;s neutral enough to wear to the office, but so much shimmer its gorgeous.  You&#x27;ll need three good coats, but it does apply smoothly.  This will be my go-to polish.</li>

    <li> Love it! it was fully opaque for me in three coats. Great formula, went on like butter. Just absolutely love this color! It&#x27;s so elegant yet not boring for us people who like all things sparkle! :) The holographic is just stunning in the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also had a great experience with the actual company also. I accidentally purchased multiple duplicates, and didn&#x27;t notice until after I payed. Well I contacted the seller about what I had done and they swapped out my duplicates for different polishes!! Than turned around and recieved my in three days (shipped Monday, and recieved it Wednsday)  Sooo awsome!! Will be purchasing not polish from this company...so far so great!</li>
    <li> Love, Hugs, &amp; Butterfly Kisses! ♥ ♥&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Subtle shimmer nude.  Sooo pretty. I used 3coats and it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
    <li> This is probably my new favorite! Goes on smooth and with a few coats you get a subtle and classy look! It&#x27;s perfect with everything and it&#x27;s good for work!</li>
    <li> I love the color, and the quality of the product.</li>
