    <li> I just finished a pack of 100 count popsicle stick style applicators, and I like these a lot more. You get much better control with the wax and there is decreased dripping.

    <li> I bought these along with my wax warmer from the same brand. This arrived quickly and in great condition. It was easy to use with the wax that I purchased at Sallys Beauty Supply. Highly recommend purchasing from this seller!</li>
    <li> It good for use n throw. Sometime I don&#x27;t get grip on it..</li>
    <li> Awful. Rather use a butter knife as a wax applicator. Waste of money. Also not useful while applying wax. Yuck</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to replenish my waxing stock. Shipped quickly, works just fine. I will order these again when I run out next time.</li>
    <li> These work marvelous and can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> These large wooden applicators do the job. There is nothing to not like about them. They are good quality applicators for hair waxing. I have no complaints. No wood splints, nothing. They are perfect.</li>
    <li> I love it! I have a very sensitive skin and this product did not give me any allergy. I use this brand for about 2 years.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed, sturdy and smooth and they are wide which is nice.</li>
    <li> Very professional. Bid with confidence</li>

    <li> good wish tips where square shaped for easier use</li>
    <li> A little pricey for popsicle sticks ;)  They do their job, but it you can find large popsicle sticks at a craft store, I would go with that.</li>
