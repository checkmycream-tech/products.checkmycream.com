      <li>okay.</li>
      <li>This product advertised water resistant and safe to use in the shower.</li>
      <li>and I love the way it makes my feel.</li>
      <li>Good results after a week, easy to use and great overall.</li>
      <li>Super affordable for the price they ask, it does an amazing cleansing on your face/skin.</li>
      <li>I really liked it when I first got it, made my face very smooth.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s such a good deal!</li>
      <li>The other brushes weren&#x27;t that impressive.</li>
      <li>Why would it be so easy to just knock off like that?</li>
      <li>Why wouldn&#x27;t they make it easy to come off?</li>
      <li>and I can I see how easy and what difference it can make to my skin.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I used this product to lightly exfoliate my skin because I have a couple of problem areas that I wanted to treat.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and she still tells me this stuff, as if she didn&#x27;t drill it in enough already, lol.</li>
      <li>All I am saying is that this brush is originally $99, yet they can&#x27;t include batteries?</li>
      <li>The foot exfoliator is great for &amp;#34;flip flop feet&amp;#34; (very dry.)</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and was super excited.</li>
      <li>so that is good enough for me!</li>
      <li>but now it&#x27;s back up to almost fifty bucks, and that isn&#x27;t fair.</li>
      <li>as effective as systems sold by skin professionals for nearly $200,&amp;#34; please look somewhere else.</li>
      <li>Not bad, I thought.</li>
      <li>The brush is adequate.</li>
      <li>Received this really quick.  </li>
      <li>As if it was just glued onto it with Elmer&#x27;s glue or something, not even super glue.</li>
      <li>and they just love them as clean face  better than other methods.  </li>
      <li>Like, don&#x27;t make me laugh, Amazon.</li>
      <li>I loved that I was able to control the speed and pick a different head for different textures.</li>
      <li>I have the most stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin, and nothing has ever helped clear them up.</li>
      <li>My skin has not felt this soft in years, absolutely love this brush.</li>
      <li>The small face exfoliator/cleaner is amazing!</li>
      <li>I just tried it today for the first time</li>
      <li>, that provides gentle exfoliation and it helps your skin look smoother!</li>
      <li>After just one week of use, I am seeing a drastic decrease in amounts and sizing of my blackheads, and my skin feels much smoother!</li>
      <li>Love the different speed options.</li>
      <li>I really think all ladies and even men will benefit from using this brush!</li>
      <li>The big brush was pretty soft and seemed nice.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin super soft!</li>
      <li>Wish the facial brush was softer but other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>She uses it everyday and said she was very pleased with it</li>
      <li>Most of the products I bought did not live up to my expectations but this one was the most spectacular fail.</li>
      <li>It cleans much deeper than your hands or a washcloth.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY recommend it!</li>
      <li>It gently exfoliates the skin.</li>
      <li>Really like my brush.</li>
      <li>Because people are going to spend $50 on this dollar store face cleansing brush, and they&#x27;re going to be really</li>
      <li>Absolutely happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin, so I need something that will really scrub my skin, and this is my new go to!</li>
      <li>Ever since I was a kid I have been aware of the need to keep your skin cleaned and well hydrated to keep it looking young and vibrant.</li>
      <li>Decent brush for the price.  </li>
      <li>The little one comes off pretty easily.</li>
      <li>its original price is super high the box was open and when pulling out the contents 2 of the little attachments just fell out.  </li>
      <li>I could have made a better cleansing brush with an ordinary household sponge taped to a drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The cost of replacing batteries twice per month alone is enough to justify splurging for a higher quality brush.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really hard to figure out how to order replacement heads; I&#x27;m not even sure that my instructions came with that part because I couldn&#x27;t find it</li>
      <li>The brush is soft and has 8 speed settings.</li>
      <li>This is a neat product but it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power or as much as I though it would.</li>
      <li>the brushes are not as soft as my clarisonic.</li>
      <li>After about a week, the brush has noticeably slowed due to needing fresh batteries.</li>
      <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m actually super mad about this.</li>
      <li>Considering how much you pay, I didn&#x27;t expect the product to last long.</li>
      <li>and I barely got around to using it.</li>
      <li>But I thought I would get a few dozen uses out of fresh batteries.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d think it would have been super glued at least.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just tried it today for the first time and I love the way it makes my feel.</li>
    <li> Honestly the product is great. You actually feel the difference in couple of days. I am using it daily !!  Now planning to buy second one for my mom. Absolutely happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be best gift ever for my mother&#x27;s day gift :)</li>
    <li> I am happy with this product. Super affordable for the price they ask, it does an amazing cleansing on your face/skin. I think I paid a good price and it does the same job as the very expensive brands. Good price good product..</li>
    <li> I could never get the handle open to insert batteries. No matter how hard I tried could not get the unit open.  Currently, item is useless to me. Wonder if anyone else had that problem; wonder if it is, in fact, a used product???!!!!</li>
    <li> I love it. However, I can&#x27;t find replacement brushes in Amazon...I don&#x27;t know where else to look.</li>
    <li> This is a neat product but it just doesn&#x27;t have enough power or as much as I though it would. I do like how it has multiple attachments.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my daughter and she loves it!  She uses it everyday and said she was very pleased with it so that is good enough for me!</li>
    <li> This product stopped working within a couple of weeks. I was looking for a water resistant cleanser to use in the shower. This product advertised water resistant and safe to use in the shower. When I took the bottom off, water poured out of the bottom and the batteries were ruined. Very disappointed. Total waste of money.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a kid I have been aware of the need to keep your skin cleaned and well hydrated to keep it looking young and vibrant. My mom worked in Dermatology most of my life so I was always being told to wear sunscreen or to stop popping my zits. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s now and she still tells me this stuff, as if she didn&#x27;t drill it in enough already, lol. Anyway, I used this product to lightly exfoliate my skin because I have a couple of problem areas that I wanted to treat. I loved that I was able to control the speed and pick a different head for different textures. It&#x27;s like having a spa treatment in your home. After you&#x27;ve done your face you can also do your feet because it comes with a pumice stone head that you can use to help remove any unwanted dead skin in those areas. Hopefully after working this into my beauty routine my mom won&#x27;t point out any blemishes, because I won&#x27;t have any. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! Great product for my face. I&#x27;m happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> My skin has not felt this soft in years, absolutely love this brush. Even my boyfriend noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> I wish I can give it a zero! So I bought this on prime and I knew I should of followed my gut!!! So anyways I got it and I barely got around to using it. And it doesn&#x27;t work!!! Wasted 20+$ D; I knew I should of cancel the order when I saw the Olay Prox- X on sale and Cheaper! Well just to warn you guys don&#x27;t buy this crap.</li>
    <li> this  thing is a joke something told me not to order this, everytime I put the brush against my face it turns off and I have to press the button to turn on again quote it want stay on for more than 10 seconds smh. . the brushes are not as soft as my clarisonic. also it didn&#x27;t get  here in 2 days like promised. very cheap product.........</li>
    <li> I LOVE this!! I got it same day shipping. The small face exfoliator/cleaner is amazing! It cleans much deeper than your hands or a washcloth. The moisturizer sponge is my favorite!! Amazing!! The foot exfoliator is great for &amp;#34;flip flop feet&amp;#34; (very dry.) the body scruber is a tad difficult to use.. Maybe I just haven&#x27;t got than hang of it yet.. But it&#x27;s a awesome idea. Love this!!</li>
    <li> I will be giving my honest and unbiased review as I was able to try this product at a discounted price one great thing about this is it has 8-Speeds. Also it has a rotating face cleaning brush, that provides gentle exfoliation and it helps your skin look smoother! It is waterproof so use it in your shower! There are also 4 Replacement Heads that help remove callous and dry skin! It came with a year warranty too!</li>
    <li> I really liked it when I first got it, made my face very smooth. But it broke after I used it about 5 times. Replaced the batteries and nothing. It&#x27;s junk</li>
    <li> Really like my brush. It does improve the appearance of your skin. I have also used the pumice stone on my feet, very nice.</li>
    <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m actually super mad about this. Amazon, you talked up Prime Day like it was the second coming of Christ, and then you give me this! THIS! This cleansing system is &amp;#34;marked down&amp;#34; from $99. Like, don&#x27;t make me laugh, Amazon. I could have made a better cleansing brush with an ordinary household sponge taped to a drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Prime Day, this bad boy was 20-something bucks. Not bad, I thought. All the other Prime Day deals consisted of baby toys and 20% off Planters peanuts. I freaked out when I saw this! I mean, I thought I was saving a lot of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and was super excited. Two days later, the package comes. I open it, and the box was all fancy, so I was thinking, &amp;#34;I can get down with this.&amp;#34; Anyway, I open it and start inspecting. The big brush was pretty soft and seemed nice. The other brushes weren&#x27;t that impressive. I was disappointed. Then, I tried to open the battery compartment. Now, I know it says &amp;#34;batteries not included&amp;#34; in the description. And I knew that going into this mess. Well, I wrestled with the battery compartment for what felt like three hours until it finally snapped open. At this point, I&#x27;ve lost about fifteen pounds because it is on so freaking tight. You&#x27;d think they were keeping the Krusty Krab secret formula inside or something. Well, it opened. No batteries, of course, like, I knew that. All I am saying is that this brush is originally $99, yet they can&#x27;t include batteries? Okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was reading the instructions, which seem pretty impossible to understand. I&#x27;d like to think of myself as a well-read, educated gal, but I couldn&#x27;t understand them. I don&#x27;t understand how this brush has eight speeds when it only has an on and off button but okay. I&#x27;ll take their word for it. It&#x27;s really hard to figure out how to order replacement heads; I&#x27;m not even sure that my instructions came with that part because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I was inspecting the other brush heads, I picked up the pumice stone thinking, &amp;#34;Yeah, buddy, my feet are gonna be lovin&#x27; this!&amp;#34; Just as that thought crossed my mind, the pumice stone fell off of the brush head and onto my lap. I kid you not! I didn&#x27;t even touch it! Like, I wasn&#x27;t playing around with it or anything. I think it fell off when I picked it up. As if it was just glued onto it with Elmer&#x27;s glue or something, not even super glue. Just Elmer&#x27;s. So, that happened. It was sitting in my lap, and I just started laughing. Why would it be so easy to just knock off like that? This product is &amp;#34;worth&amp;#34; $99! You&#x27;d think it would have been super glued at least. It&#x27;s not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I&#x27;ve already decided to send it back. But that isn&#x27;t even the best part. I take the little brush head off, and I try to put on the big soft brush head just to see how to change the brush heads. The little one comes off pretty easily. I pop on the big one and lock it in place. Okay! Nice, nice. Well, then, this thing gets stuck! The big brush head got stuck onto the base and would not come off. How weird is that? Why wouldn&#x27;t they make it easy to come off? If I am using this in the shower, and I have wet and soapy hands, I don&#x27;t want to fight my brush head to come off. I want it to come off real easy. I don&#x27;t wanna play games; I wanna get clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed with this overall product, and I just wish it was made better. I know I got it for 20-something dollars, but now it&#x27;s back up to almost fifty bucks, and that isn&#x27;t fair. Because people are going to spend $50 on this dollar store face cleansing brush, and they&#x27;re going to be really disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just take my word for it! If you&#x27;re looking for a brush that &amp;#34;is as effective as systems sold by skin professionals for nearly $200,&amp;#34; please look somewhere else. This is not that face cleansing brush. I get better results from my $15 Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System.</li>
    <li> Good results after a week, easy to use and great overall.</li>
    <li> It can not handle the body brush, it starts to strip the plastic gears. Face brush is ok.</li>
    <li> I have the most stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin, and nothing has ever helped clear them up. After just one week of use, I am seeing a drastic decrease in amounts and sizing of my blackheads, and my skin feels much smoother! I have really oily skin, so I need something that will really scrub my skin, and this is my new go to! I HIGHLY recommend it! *I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> I look younger now then I did before using it. I really think all ladies and even men will benefit from using this brush!</li>
    <li> Product arrived DIRTY! It looks and smells like something that you put in your garage... and left it there for years. The plastic is brittle. I am NOT going to use this on my face. There is dirt in the bristles.</li>
    <li> Two words for this product- Love it. I use it daily with a scrub (sometimes microdermabrasion scrub). The brush is soft and has 8 speed settings. It also has 5 replacement heads. It gently exfoliates the skin. Before this brush I used an exfoliating sponge and I can I see how easy and what difference it can make to my skin. Absolutely love this brush. Product received for review and evaluation.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok to use for Traveling</li>
    <li> Received this really quick.  Giving 4 stars because it does have a habit of just stopping. I thought maybe my hand position was hitting the on/off area so held hand in different area but still does it. Was little disappointed in packaging even tho I got for good price its original price is super high the box was open and when pulling out the contents 2 of the little attachments just fell out.  But i will keep to try if its keeps stopping will be sending back. Pros: Waterproof...8 speeds Cons: Turns off while using.  EDIT:  been using for a week now and AWEFUL whenever using the big body brush its constantly turning off and I don&#x27;t press hard. Either i got one with a defect or its just crap. Took back 2stars. update: sent back horrible product hate to have to give it 1 star</li>
    <li> I ordered one for my daughter and one for my  granddaughter and they just love them as clean face  better than other methods.  They told me they have been wanting to get these but too expense.  I told them got these for special price and couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  They love them.</li>
    <li> this item has not good quality! the box doesn&#x27;t have any information that like where its manufactured</li>
    <li> Decent brush for the price.  But the speed is not as described.  Wilk do for now</li>
    <li> The brush is adequate. Considering how much you pay, I didn&#x27;t expect the product to last long. But I thought I would get a few dozen uses out of fresh batteries. That wasn&#x27;t the case. After about a week, the brush has noticeably slowed due to needing fresh batteries. (I used it twice per day.) The cost of replacing batteries twice per month alone is enough to justify splurging for a higher quality brush.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price. Wish the facial brush was softer but other than that it&#x27;s great. Love the different speed options.</li>
    <li> I love this! And it&#x27;s such a good deal! Leaves my skin super soft!</li>
    <li> It does not work. It is poorly made. And the stand that is designed to hold it upright fails at the task. I bought this product as part of the BIG Amazon sale in July. Most of the products I bought did not live up to my expectations but this one was the most spectacular fail. I love Amazon and seldom return but if this product was still eligible for a return back it would go. Instead I&#x27;ll just pitch it and be happy I didn&#x27;t pay full price for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for my face.Everything was as described and the brushes do a really good job.I already see an improvement on my skin so definitely recommended.</li>
