      <li>It doesn&#x27;t need batteries to operate and is very sturdy for it&#x27;s size and compact.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

      <li>Yeah this is gross, but this is a REAL review.</li>
      <li>This tool is very sturdy and well made giving it a solid look.  </li>

      <li>I did not realize that this product was completely manual when I bought it.</li>
      <li>Quality German product that replaced an older version of this product.</li>
      <li>Buy a trimmer for cutting nose hairs, and not cut anything and pull the hair, trimmer had more good and less expensive than using batteries, better would have bought these.</li>
      <li>It is, of course, more difficult to use than the power tools (two-handed, and manual dexterity is not my strong point), but the process was less painful and the result was good, which is what I wanted.</li>

<li> complete waste of money.  </li>
<li> This can be slow, awkward and not as effective as the battery powered units especially around the ears.</li>
<li> I purchased this because my previous electric trimmers (2 different ones) just died after about 10 month of use.  </li>
<li> OK it is a little bit awkward to use.</li>

<li> waste your money on this -</li>

<li> The product sucks, not good at all.</li>
<li> Unfortunately it proved to be useless for cutting the fine hairs of my nose and impossible to use for ears since operating the mechanism  </li>
<li> I used a small trim scissors but it was difficult getting to some areas without sticking, pinching or cutting myself.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed customer here.</li>

    <li> I used a small trim scissors but it was difficult getting to some areas without sticking, pinching or cutting myself.  I then got a small battery operated job that did get to those areas but pulled on or did not cut all the hairs.  Then I got this Dovo trimmer.  It not only gets to those hard-to-get areas but cleanly cuts the hairs without any pulling or pinching.  The only reason I did not get this unit sooner is because I thought the price was a little high for what seemed to be such a simple tool.  I&#x27;m now convinced the price reflects the precision of the machining to produce this clean cutting, non-irritating trimmer.  This is not some cheap stamped piece of metal.  It appears to have been machined from a solid piece of steel.  I believe this will be the last nose and ear hair trimmer I&#x27;ll ever have to purchase.</li>
    <li> So precise and wonderful. Manual to operate but so smooth you won&#x27;t notice.  It is very sharp and controls my unruly hairs and nairs perfectly.  No pinching or biting.  Just smooth no pain close.</li>
    <li> Buy a trimmer for cutting nose hairs, and not cut anything and pull the hair, trimmer had more good and less expensive than using batteries, better would have bought these.</li>
    <li> Quality German product that replaced an older version of this product. Is not as convenient as a powered clipper, but once you get used to the manual action, it works better.</li>
    <li> dedicate German engineering and no power use and working really good.  Plan to buy for my brother.</li>
    <li> I cannot turn the mechanism, and I have done everything to get the internal parts to rotate so I could cut the nose hairs.  I had to throw it away and I am looking for a better mfg.  No reason, at this cost, them mechanism should &#x27;freeze&#x27;.</li>
    <li> The product sucks, not good at all. Will never buy this product again&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this -</li>
    <li> I did not realize that this product was completely manual when I bought it. Although it is not powered by batteries it works OK when you twist the end with your right hand. It is hard to twist and work with your hands on large serfaces of hair. Works well to do your ears and nose. A bit hard to keep twisting to get your chest hairs out. Would be better if you had a battery powred motor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of the cheap battery-powered trimmers and found them quite frustrating. I felt like there was more yanking than cutting. My selection of this product was based on the fact that it was the most expensive (hoping that this was a proxy for quality) and I&#x27;m pleased with the result. My first use was almost a disappointment because I thought nothing was happening (I couldn&#x27;t FEEL anything!), but then I realized that the coarse hairs had been trimmed without any pain. It is, of course, more difficult to use than the power tools (two-handed, and manual dexterity is not my strong point), but the process was less painful and the result was good, which is what I wanted. I just hope (and expect) that it lasts for years and that I don&#x27;t have to revisit this purchase in my lifetime (two or three decades).</li>
    <li> Simple, solid construction, easier to use, and does a far better and cleaner job than my battery powered trimmers - all of which have worn out or fallen apart within a year.</li>
    <li> This is very ecological (manual trimming system) and no battery required.  It functions pretty well, but needs some practice.  Electric model cuts smoother without any pain, I imagine due to cutter&#x27;s RPM.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  It&#x27;s manual, too small, and doesn&#x27;t work cry well.  Very disappointed customer here.</li>
    <li> works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> Works extremely better than those battery operated nose trimmers. I would recommend this to anyone looking to acquire a nose trimmer.</li>
    <li> Wow!  Very happy I ordered</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well, is somewhat difficult to clean.</li>
    <li> Did not work at all.  I ended up using the old fashion way, a nose trimming scissor to do the job.</li>
    <li> Cuts way better then any electric trimmer I have had. Feels great in your hand. Nice and heavy/solid. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Identical to the Groom Mate item at a much higher price.  If you check the Dovo website, you will not find this item.</li>
    <li> This nose hair trimmer is remarkable,it is purpose designed, it trims the hairs of my boyfriends nose to regal perfection.</li>
    <li> This tool is very sturdy and well made giving it a solid look.  Unfortunately it proved to be useless for cutting the fine hairs of my nose and impossible to use for ears since operating the mechanism  is cumbersome at best.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because my previous electric trimmers (2 different ones) just died after about 10 month of use.  So, as an alternative option (manual operation should give you less mechanical error), I decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works well, but you need practice.&lt;br /&gt;I still like electric model better.  This is just a personal preference, and depends on a type of trimming you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had *dozens* of nose hair trimmers. My nose is VERY sensitive, and gets itchy. I have a deviated septum. Yeah this is gross, but this is a REAL review. The electronic trimmers I&#x27;ve used *ALL* broke before they should have. This Dovo trimmer is expensive, but it&#x27;s more ECONOMICAL than buying a new electronic trimmer every year. Oh, and I had a cheaper manual trimmer. I lost it, otherwise I&#x27;d still have it. See, it worked, just not well. But this trimmer is WAY ahead of the cheaper one I had. This one cuts! It works and works WELL. Every now and then a bit of a pull, but just keep twisting and it cuts, no big deal. BUY!</li>
    <li> I have tried many battery powered trimmers all being very inferior..  The new trimmer is extremely high&lt;br /&gt;Quality and should last forever.</li>
    <li> So make sure you know this is a MANUALLY OPERATED device.  It&#x27;s made very well, but if your used to a 1 minute routine from the little AA powered trimmers then expected a lot longer time. You have to twist the end to make the cutters move. This can be slow, awkward and not as effective as the battery powered units especially around the ears.</li>
    <li> I love Dovo products, they get the job don and are light on maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this needs much of an explanation more than they do their job well (almost no pulling of of hairs) and they are light on maintenance, which is perfect. If these hold up like my clippers (7+ years and not a hitch), then I&#x27;m going to enjoy these trouble free for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++ Construction&lt;br /&gt;+ Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Nothings perfect (pulls a hair every once in a long, long while)</li>
    <li> This product is not what is advertised. It is not actually a Dovo Klipette, it is a Groom Mate-branded product in a Dovo cardboard case.</li>
    <li> Quality German made instrument  precisely machined  stainless and cuts hairs like a razor effortlessly and precise …LOVE IT !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Small to carry with you anywhere for a pop up hair happening.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a Christmas gift for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  It doesn&#x27;t need batteries to operate and is very sturdy for it&#x27;s size and compact.&lt;br /&gt;It works far better than any other nose trimmer he&#x27;s ever had and it cuts the nose hair instead of yanking on them.  I actually tried it and it was totally painless!</li>
    <li> complete waste of money.  didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I previously used a battery powered Panasonic. This little tool works much better. Although it takes two hands, it&#x27;s easy to get used to it. My old device often pulled hairs as much as cut them. I&#x27;m very happy the old one broke and I found this!</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Amazon from Head totoe beauty back in April. I paid around $39 for it. Here I am some 7 months later and I just realized that they shipped me a Groom Mate! It isn&#x27;t a Dovo! I am pretty upset at this fact. I would buy directly from Dovo to make sure you actually get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Wish I had found this  precision, beautifully machined tool years ago.  I previously used the battery powered devices that tended to pinch and pull while clipping.  This small,  manually operated, high precision tool trims effortlessly.  You just hold and guide with one hand and use your other hand to rotate the internal shaft by holding the opposite end and moving your thumb and finger gently back and forth.  This works great in your nose and ears.  Not for large expanses of trimming of the chest, legs and lawn mowing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used better $9.99 moldels.  It will take you twice to three times as long to groom. Save your money.</li>
    <li> This thing is great. OK it is a little bit awkward to use. Especially if your used to using the battery operated Nose hair clippers. I am not comparing the two because this review is not about Apples to Oranges.&lt;br /&gt;  I gave this five stars because it works as said. I used it last night and it did a great job. It was so smooth cutting that I was not sure if it actually was. The battery operated ones you can hear and feel it cut but this is quiet and smooth. I did my Ears and Nose and did not feel anything. When I was done the results were 100%. NO BLEEDIND OR PULLING!&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this one for a little more money because I believe this is the original and because it is made in Germany. German Knifes are the best and I wanted quality. I am glad I paid the extra money. I am always replacing my battery operated one because they break and then I can&#x27;t find a battery etc. So yes I have my battery operated one and now I have this one. I do think that this Dovo will out last many battery operated ones.</li>
