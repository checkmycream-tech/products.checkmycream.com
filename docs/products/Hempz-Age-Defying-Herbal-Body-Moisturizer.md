<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but would be much better if there was no sickening scent.  Way too expensive.</li>
    <li> Excellent Emolient moisturizer. Softly scented, easily absorbable, leaves skin Soft to touch! Will try other scents such as Citrus...</li>
    <li> Hempz Age Defying Herbal Moisturizer is my favorite body lotion. I especially like the scent of the age defying formula, compared to the other scented Hempz lotions. Hempz lotion keeps my skin moisturized and young looking. I put it on daily, after I shower. It&#x27;s a nice light scent without being too overpowering. It works well to help me keep a suntan longer, and it prevents my skin from drying out in the winter weather. Hempz lotion works well all year long. If you haven&#x27;t tried Hempz brand lotion yet, you definitely should!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
    <li> i use this after i tan and shower and my skin is very soft and radiant from it. It also has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! It smells really good. I always have people ask me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> Greatest lotion ever!!  The smell is amazinggggg.</li>
    <li> Excellent, great product😃</li>
    <li> Very good product and for less money.  Can&#x27;t beat that.  I have ;used this lotion for years and buy it for my son. He likes it as well. It is less than I paid previously.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of hemp products and I thought I would try this product. It smells wonderful and does not overpower your senses. The reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because I cannot vouch just yet if this really helps with defying age. 4 Stars goes to the seller for selling this at a good price and for being so good at taping the top portion to the bottle to ensure that it did not leak during shipment. I still cannot get over the beautiful smell. I do not like scents that give off too much floral or too much musk. Of course everyone is different in what they like but if you are looking for that in between scent try this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great everyday lotion. It is not greasy at all and absorbs well. It has a great scent and on Amazon its a lot less expensive than a salon.</li>
    <li> This lotion moisturizes, firms my skin, smells incredible but not overwhelming. Only complaint is that it goes fast I use daily and go thru a bottle a wk.</li>
    <li> This product is better than I ever tried in the \\&quot;mainstream\\&quot; offerings.  I went to a salon for a manicure recently and this product was there for the customer to sample.  I was amazed that it IS NOT the usual heavy, greasy products I&#x27;ve used in the past. But is in fact, quickly absorbed and does a great job at softening. Far out-weighs any of the dozens of products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Helps old age arm wrinkle disappear</li>
    <li> Little more moisturizing that other Hempz . Works for face and body...</li>
    <li> Its hemp and it works good on dry skin. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin.  A great moisturizer for winter skin!</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful cream I have had in years--if ever..  I have sent it to my aunt, and she loves it too--she had a massage using it.  Our nephew came over and inquired, then tried it, loved it too.  Everyone says how lovely it smells, and how ultra creamy it is.  For those with dry skin, it is a gift!  In fact, a hairdresser had given it to me as a gift originally.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent moisturizer. I love the smell; it&#x27;s not really girly or masculine, so pretty much anyone can use it. The smell is also light enough that you can still use your perfume or cologne, without the scents clashing. Hempz Age Defying lotion does a great job moisturizing. It&#x27;s really light, absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy, and doesn&#x27;t leave you feel sticky...even during the hotter months. I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference as far as the \\&quot;age defying\\&quot; stuff goes, but it really is a great moisturizer and that&#x27;s really all I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s non greasy, smells great, and works wonders on dry skin.</li>
    <li> The Hempz is by far the best lotion I have used on my skin in a very long while.  It smells good, is not sticky and stays with my skin all day.  My skin is very dry and I could not find anything other than Vaseline that was useful.  This is the best.  Not sure about the Age-Defying part, but it has worked wonderfully to moisten and keep my skin from being dry after a few hours.</li>
    <li> love this lotion!!! I use it every day and seems like the scent and moisture never goes away :)</li>
    <li> I recently had weight loss surgery and I was starting to notice my skin dryer than normal.  On top of that, I&#x27;m worried about my skin getting loose (I&#x27;m in my 40s) ..  I ordered this and by the 3rd day, I&#x27;m already noticing a difference in the texture of my skin.  I will have to admit that I was surprised.  I feel so soft.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if it will help with the elasticity of my skin, but I&#x27;m pleased with the results so far.  And the scent.. a very soft scent, but it&#x27;s very pleasant.  I haven&#x27;t even been wearing my body spray because I like the scent so well!! Very pleased with this product.  Will update later to see if it really helps with firming my skin.</li>
    <li> I love Hempz lotion! It smells great, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky, and makes my skin feel great. I use this after being out in the sun and if I have a sunburn, this product will protect against peeling. It also extends tan life and the price is much more reasonable than in a store or beauty salon. I stocked up on this becuase all my family and freinds use this when we travel during the summer. Best lotion ever!</li>
    <li> I use it lot I like it and smell good</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have ordered it many times before &amp; have noticed a difference in my skin. You guys are so much cheaper than buying it from a store.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion , I use it every day , not just after tanning. I love the smell of this lotion.</li>
    <li> I like the produce and it work good on the litter things that you use it for.</li>
    <li> Love Hempz moisturiser, its rich but lightweight &amp; quickly absorbed, Ive tried several of the scented varieties an they all smell great.</li>
    <li> My wife will use nothing else again.  On her 4th order, so far, she is still excited when a fresh one arrives.  Pleasant smell and most soothing to a hyper allergic skin.</li>
    <li> I trust Hempz...I&#x27;ve been using it for years now. The only thing I did not like about this moisturizer is the smell. It&#x27;s very neutral and the last time I bought this kind of moisturizer from Hempz it had a nice sweet scent to it. Besides that it works great.</li>
    <li> Gift for a friend, she says it really helped her dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great for warm climates. I live in Texas with lots of humidity and this lotion is great! Its not greasy.</li>
    <li> INVIGORATING!!!!! I love this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> Feels great. Just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Stop buying other moisturizer this one is the best! Anything with the Hempz label is amazing! I&#x27;ve never had softer skin. You will notice a difference immediately.</li>
    <li> This lotion is most soothing, sinks right into your skin without leaving a greasy feeling. My skin is noticeably smoother after using it.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Not greasy. Nice</li>
    <li> It works great but it has a very strong smell that makes wearing it all day unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Love it works very well, not too oily just moisturizes</li>
    <li> I have dry skin that becomes ashy if not moisturized. This lotion not only moisturizes without being oily, but I noticed that my skin looked better (smoother and tighter) after just a few uses.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using this for years and would not buy any other moisturizer. fantastic product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever tried. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Hempz lotions. I was happy to find it for so much cheaper on here, and the quality is just the same. The smell is nice, almost a light baby powder smell, and it absorbs very quickly. It keeps my skin nice and soft all day. It also seems to be helping with my stretch marks on my belly, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for years. It&#x27;s soft, smooth, NATURAL, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind like all the others. The smell is subtle and just right.&lt;br /&gt;This order is about the 5th order I&#x27;ve placed for it, and I will definitely keep ordering it in the future!</li>
    <li> Greatest Lotion ever!!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS.  GREATEST STUFF ON EARTH!IT LASTS FOREVER SO I ONLY BUY IT ONCE EVERY 3 YEARS...</li>
    <li> I bought this at a beauty product store for almost twice the price. But I loved the scent so much that for the next bottle I shopped online and found it here for a lot less. I love the light sandalwood and vanilla scent that&#x27;s not feminine or masculine. I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging properties, but it&#x27;s a nice lotion that absorbs easily and smells good.</li>
    <li> I love Hempz Herbal Age Defying Moisturizer.  It is such a great product that it is the only moisturizer I will use.  Not only does it beautifully soften the skin, it also smells great. I have been stopped by people asking me what fragrance I am wearing and telling me it smells awesome.  I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Hempz Herbal moisturizer is a great product.  The only one better than this one is the original, it smells much better.</li>
    <li> World&#x27;s best moisturizer for me!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this product does seem to improve skin texture ( makes it more supple and softer...helps a lot with dryness</li>
    <li> I bought this in Colorado where the humidity level was low and it kept me moisturized. When I returned home, it does not feel greasy and kept my winter skin well moisturized. The fragrance is pleasant but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Love this. Smells great, and really helps keeping my skin fresh and hydrated.</li>
    <li> Best body moisturizer ever!!!  I have been using Body Drench products for years.I am 65 and all my friends and family are envious of my soft skin. I never will change</li>
    <li> Best Lotion Ever&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.  So excited to find it on Amazon. Originally received small bottle as a gift &amp; was hooked.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion and have for years!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t want a bunch of fruity fragrances in a moisturizer. This keeps my skin moisturized and has a pleasant smell to it. Not over powering like some moisturizers. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion brand! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or oily. It absorbs nicely and leaves your skin looking smooth and beautiful!</li>
    <li> loved it... best one ever..</li>
    <li> Amazing scent. Feels great</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks right in.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful!!!!  Most other lotions need about four or five times as much lotion to yield the sane results.  And it works about three time faster than any other I&#x27;ve used.  My original introduction was at a cost nearly five times the Amazon price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being derived from hemp (AKA marijuana) made this a novelty item, but it really is every bit as good as promised, and then some!</li>
    <li> I love the Hempz senses that they have come out with!  They are very smooth and smell soooo good!  I recommend all of them!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the original.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It moisturizes for over 24 hours.  It smells great!  Hempz never let&#x27;s me down!</li>
    <li> Just a great overall body lotion...I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m seeing any &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; proof, but it does what I need it to do, which is to keep my winter skin soft &amp; moisturized.  My 17-yr old son is using it, too - lol - and he is usually very picky about anything that might smell &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  This does have a scent, for sure (I want to say it&#x27;s like lemon cake batter) but it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger or be overpowering.</li>
    <li> I live the smell of this product. I would use it everyday if it was cheaper, but I at least use it after tanning or being outside</li>
    <li> This is the best product for dry skin.  I have tried other products and this hemp seed oil really works.  The lotion is light and creamy, really absorbs well.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my decollete area.  I will review again after a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, obtaining it only through salons.  It&#x27;s an awesome product, both the regular and the Cucumber Jasmine scent,  both have a very pleasant &amp; mild smell.  The lotion aborbs quickly and leaves no sticky, oily or waxy feel to the skin.  Best of all now Amazon has it at a lower price than the local salons!</li>
    <li> My skin was so dry due to medical reasons when I first started using this that I had to use TONS!  It absorbed very quickly into my skin (almost too quickly as I could hardly work this in) and I had to keep reapplying it.  Thankfully, this really is not greasy.  I was afraid I would go through the whole bottle in less then a week.  After a few applications, I found that I used much less and my skin looks and feels great.    My stomach after 2 children was all saggy and had many folds, much like the face of a bulldog.  After the first use, my skin was smoother and appeared more toned, like I only had the one child.  I am finding that the quality of my skin continues to improve.     Based on results alone, I would normally give this 5 stars, however there is one little problem.  It smells like, dare I say it, an old lady.  Thankfully the smell is mild enough that I can cover it up fairly easily.</li>
    <li> IF YOU LOVE THE HEMPZ SMELL (WHITE MUSK) YOU WILL LOVE THIS. ITS INCREDIBLY THICK AND IT ABSORBS QUICKLY. IT REALLY IS HEAVENLY FOR YOUR SKIN AND LEAVES IT SMELLING INCREDIBLE FOR HOURS AND ITS WONDERFUL POST BATH OR POST SUNTANNING.</li>
    <li> I first bought it because my daughter had it on her desk and liked the way it smells and my hands feel and I sure am pleased with the selection.</li>
    <li> Love the texture, it blends in nicely</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well!  I saw a difference in just one application.  I highly recommend this lotion to firm skin and help with the elimination of dimpling.</li>
    <li> Love this moisturizer. It really does make my skin so soft. Feels wonderful. Have tried other scents and liked all that I have tried. Will keep purchasing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff  --- been using it for 2 years and my face and body.&lt;br /&gt;It works great--- I&#x27;m out of words</li>
    <li> Love the lotion and the price makes it worth trying the product</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing lotion! When I first starting using Hempz lotion I had the Pomegranate and loved the scent. My best friend gave me a bottle of the Age Defying and for awhile I didn&#x27;t use it. When I finally tried it I was amazed! My night gown would have the most wonderful scent the next morning so I fell in love! I still love the Pomegranate so now I have to purchase both!! Hempz lotions are so rich and don&#x27;t just evaporate from your skin but absorbs and gives your skin such a soft, wonderful, feel and smell.</li>
    <li> Thanks! Great product</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but I have always paid too much for it at the tanning salon or at Ulta! Amazon has it for a great price! I love the smell and it moisturizes like no other. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smells wonderful and keeps my skin nice.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and it is healing to my dry winter skin,,,,The scent is very soothing  and my scaly patches on my legs are now smooth again! This hemp oil is a miracle</li>
    <li> Wonderful lotion that has wonderful healing power!! It truly makes your arms and legs smoother, and will help heal any sores.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lotion that has a fresh, clean fragrance!!!!</li>
    <li> powdery light natural scent with a smooth dry finish and my skin almost tingles.  i got the travel size first and loved it.  felt wonderful.  love seeing hemp leaves in the bathroom as well because im an avid hemp seed eater and hemp is an awesome crop along with its matey ...fa sho.  best smell.  me likey.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to any one Hempz is a great for my skin.  I have told others its a great buy</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Non-greasy, absorbs easily, works great, and has a slight very pleasant&lt;br /&gt;aroma.  I have been using my daughters and finally decided to get my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. The age defying works so well!</li>
    <li> Love the smell, not greasy.</li>
    <li> love this stuff.. feels so good on.. Thought I remembered it smelling really good, not much of a scent. Im ok with that</li>
    <li> This is very nice quality lotion. It is normally very pricey so I was thrilled to find it for such great deal through Amazon. It has a very light scent so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with my perfume. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful, moisturizing lotion.  I received a small sample bottle from a friend and knew I had to buy more.  It smells great and makes my skin very soft.  I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! Great for my skin and it&#x27;s not grease or have a strong smell.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the product, recieved when expected  Love the product, Love the smell.  Great product. Makes my skin feel&lt;br /&gt;very soft, and took away small lines in my hands.  Great after shower.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff. I will buy it from now on and will not be going back to my Bath &amp; Body Works lotion ever again.</li>
    <li> Love the lotion - very thick.  I use it all over and because it is so thick you have to use quite a bit to cover the entire bod.  The smell is good.  When the bottle arrived some of the lotion had oozed out of the bottle during shipping, that sucked; probably lost several ounces.  This size bottle will only last me a month or so.</li>
    <li> After receiving the product, I read the ingredients which actually contains several harmful chemicals including PEGs, Yellow 5 (CI 19140) and Yellow 6 (CI 15985) to name a few. I returned it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Smells great, works wonderful. I have tried so many lotions in my life and this one makes my skin feel amazing.  Would highly recommend, especially to anyone who has drier skin!</li>
    <li> I Absolutely LOVE this lotion!💚 It smells amazing, plus it makes my skin incredibly soft and it stays on ALL DAY LONG! I used to have dry cracked skin, and I&#x27;ve tried EVERY lotion known to man...however, NONE of them worked very well. And I just wasted a lot of money for products I never used(we&#x27;ve all been there)! I was so happy the day I was given a sample of Hempz Lotion to try at my tanning salon! I immediately fell head over heals in love with it! That was over 5 years ago...and I truly believe this is the best lotion on the market. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase... It&#x27;s a must try product!</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer out there.</li>
    <li> A nice moisturizer in terms of consistency and effectiveness, but definitely over-perfumed.</li>
    <li> On their website, they don&#x27;t list all the ingredients, only the good stuff.  When I received my Age Defying Herbal Moisturizer, it contains Yellow 5 and Yellow 6!!!  The newest addition to their body creme collections, Triple Moisture Herbal Whipped Body Creme, has Blue 1 and Violet 2!!!!  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  They should be honest on their website or get rid of the poisonous ingredients all together.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion in the world. It moisturizes better than my Victoria Secret lotions with a light, yummy fragrance. Buy this! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff, doesn&#x27;t have as much perfumey junk as a lot of the in-store products do.  Was shipped quickly, and was more economical than buying it at a salon.</li>
    <li> This is probably the best Excellent Herbal Moisturizer I have used yet. For years I used Lubriderm, but now I use Hempz. It has good herbal content in it &amp; makes your skin feel really great. They carry many natural herbal choices for this moisturizer.  You get a better price on line for this product rather than buying it in a salon. Just buy one of these, use it every day or so, &amp; you will be ordering it like I do. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Hempz moisturizer lotion (Age Defying and Cumcumber &amp; Jasmine)  really moisturizes and makes my skin feel silky, and it smells very nice.  I have been using for a while, getting it from my nail salon.  The only problem was the $22 it cost there.  I was very pleasantly surprised at the Amazon price of $11.95, and no shippping costs since I am Prime member.  I just wish other Hempz scents were also Prime eligible.</li>
    <li> I love this product, mostly due to the scent.  But, I think it does leave my skin soft and can only hope that it is Age Defying.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used - and I&#x27;ve tried them all!  Goes on like silk and leaves your skin glowing, soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used. It smells awesome! I usually moisturize everyday after I shower and I have noticed quite a difference in my skin. I have been using this lotion for quite a while now and I would strongly recommend it to my friends. You will love it!</li>
    <li> love this lotion I use it in the summer when I go tanning. smells great and absorbs quickly and makes my skin very smooth.</li>
    <li> Works great! Didnt notice it making me feel greasy or anything, works great and seems to absorb quickly. I really like the light scent of this lotion and it has already started to make a difference</li>
    <li> This is agreat product, it does what it says and it smells great, I carry a smaller bottle in my purse.</li>
    <li> Great product,  I&#x27;ve using for over 10 yrs. and now for half the price.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this Hempz brand for lotions and sunning.  I love the smell and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
    <li> My mom and I can&#x27;t wear this because the smell is way too strong. I had to give it to a girl friend who likes this kind of &amp;#34;foofy&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> HempZ is the greatest lotion. It makes your skin feel soft not sticky. Because of the vitamins, antioxidants, &amp; minerals it helps to get rid of lines and firms my face. It makes my skin feel healthier. The scent is very light and smells so good. I love this product and will continue buying it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t attest to the age-defying part of this because I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see any changes. It smells like I&#x27;ve been hiding in a nursing home for weeks if I put this on my skin. The fragrance is absolutely horrible. I ended up throwing this away. Too bad, because I love Hempz products and was excited to find an age defying product from them.</li>
    <li> These lotions are great--this one does not smell as good as the original but I enjoy it as well.  Hempz herbal moisturizers keep your skin well hydrated and make your skin feel like silk--age defying is new one for me but think I will find it equally pleasing.</li>
    <li> Great lotion, but doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the Original blend.</li>
    <li> Yuck. I don&#x27;t like the odor at all.</li>
    <li> This cream is one of the best creams that I have every had!  Love this!  Must have for everyday use!</li>
    <li> Like the smell and texture of it.</li>
    <li> Likde mine so well, I gave this to one of my friends and she loved it</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 10 years.  I travel for work and take a travel size of this moisturizer with me, as I will not go a day without it.  I use after showering on wet skin to lock in the moisture.  I also use less product by applying to wet skin.  There is no greasy residue.  My skin is hydrated all day.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, as described</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  No greasy or perfumey lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion....Stays on your skin and the scent is not overpowering....Will order it again.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products.  I have EXTREMELY dry skin and it really helps bring back the moisture.  Delivered quickly.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is so foul I cannot believe it. Anything that has a pungent baby diaper powder should have a warning. YUCK!</li>
    <li> I think the lotion I received has been watered down.  It is only about half as thick as what I have been purchasing in stores.  The price is definitely right, but it is not the original lotion.  Disappointed in the quality, even though it is in the Hempz bottle, it is not original!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion.  LOVE the smell of it too.</li>
    <li> makes my skin super soft.</li>
    <li> My wife would usually buy this product at a very popular makeup store and it cost over $20.  It is half the price on Amazon, which is great for me!&lt;br /&gt;She raves about the way it soothes her skin, smells, and the overall quality of the lotion.  I also think it has a great smell as it is not overpowering, but a very subtle clean smell.</li>
    <li> Smells and feels good. Not greassy!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It is very hydrating, the scent is light, my kids and husband love using it too.</li>
    <li> Best Moisturizer ever!!!!</li>
    <li> great smelling and seems to make my skin really soft .</li>
    <li> I started using this product over a year ago and recommend it to everyone!!  No animal products, not tested on animals and the BEST lotion I have found since my former favorite (St. Ives) sold themselves to a company that does test on animals.</li>
    <li> I have been using Hemp lotion for years and love it. I decided to try the age defying lotion. My order arrived quickly and in  perfect condition. so excited for my new lotion I tried it right away..... omg the smell is terrible I put it right back in the box to return. Most of the hemp products and clean and fresh smelling this is a very  heavy perfume smell it is very strong. the scent is not for everyone.</li>
    <li> The smell of this lotion is amazing.  Your skin stays moisturized all day,  and becomes nice and soft.</li>
    <li> I love hempz but this product isn&#x27;t what I normally use and it broke me out and now I have 2 bottles that aren&#x27;t going to get used unless I give it to someone who will use it. It was shipped right away but it has nothing to do with who sent it, I just didn&#x27;t think I would have a problem with it.</li>
    <li> These products are great, but the vendor sent me the wrong lotion and I have not been able to reach them to correct the problem.</li>
    <li> when received water was floating on top of lotion....even when removed the surface water more water than lotion was noted...no scent at all....when applied very runny and not moisturizing....will not purchase again....</li>
    <li> Great product.  I have used it for years.  Can&#x27;t be without it.  A lotion that is really good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion.  The smell is very mild and it works great keeping my skin soft.  I use it on my face as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Absorbs well into your skin. Does not have a residue after application. Actually moisturizes the skin without any oiliness. Mild fragrance which does not overpower. Have used all the name brand moisturizers , including more than twice the price. Hempz is by far superior.</li>
    <li> Really liked this product smooth on my skin and has a great fragrance.... that&#x27;s not over bearing in smell gets four stars from me</li>
    <li> Love this lotion. I have been trying different lotions to keep my skin moisturized and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t ware off fast.</li>
    <li> I usually purchase this product from my local beauty supply...but they were out so I looked on Amazon and there it was. I&#x27;ve used several different hempz creams for the last 15 years or so. This one is now the one that is appropriate for my skin. My husband uses it also and likes the fact it does not have a heavy scent like some of the other hempz products.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on my coworker and had to have it for the scent. I don&#x27;t usually use lotion on my body except in the winter because I don&#x27;t like the feeling on my skin, but this is not very sticky or thick. And I LOVE the scent.</li>
    <li> Great for any type of skin and I love how this lotion smells. It is one of my favorites compared to the others. The price is very cheap compared to other stores like Ulta.</li>
    <li> This lotion is wonderful.  It has a very pleasant smell, and is not greasy at all.  It absorbs quickly, and makes my skin extremely soft.  Will definitely use this product again.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great gift!</li>
    <li> it is ok, this cream,</li>
    <li> I use the Hempz triple whipped moisturizer (blue) which is perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this one as well as purple and citrus and did not care for them.&lt;br /&gt;I am quite particular about scents so this could be perfect for someone else.</li>
    <li> Good lotion, love the smell, but I found one that works better and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I ordered Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, Age Defying, along with Olay Quench Plus Firming Body Lotion--both were highly reviewed. I decided to use Hempz Herbal Moisturizer, Age Defying, on the left side of my body and the Olay Quench Plus Firming Body Lotion on the right side of my body. I liked how the Hempz product went on because it was so thick and creamy. The Olay product was thinner. I liked the smell of the Olay product better than the Hempz product. I&#x27;ve been using the products for about 2 weeks once a day. I&#x27;ve noticed that the left side feels softer and I thought noticeably less aged. This observation was confirmed by my18 year old daughter yesterday at lunch. While she was pinching the skin on my hands, saying how weird it was that my hands were turning into her grandmother&#x27;s hands, she noticed that the left hand and arm were less wrinkly, dry, and crepey. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Smells so nice, good deal</li>
    <li> I have been a Hempz user for a long time and always buy through Amazon. This is the only lotion I will use. I hate lotions that leave my skin feeling greasy or slimy, but Hempz soaks right in. I am also a huge fan of the smell. My fiance always steals it from me to use on his rough construction worker hands, and he always thanks me for not buying that &amp;#34;girly lotion with the sparkles in it&amp;#34; :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful moisturizer for the body (not face), has a delightful fragrance, subtle and very pleasant. My sister has a bottle by her bed and I tried some and was immediately hooked.</li>
    <li> Best all around moisturizer.  Have used it for years.  Keeps you moist without the need to keep reapplying.  Doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as some of the other Hempz though.</li>
    <li> Hempz products are the best.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and this cream really helps to keep my skin moist.  I would definitly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion a lot. I have used a few bottle. I do think that with a clean diet and exercise it does help the skins appearance. It smells clean and does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I regularly purchase this lotion, and after at least 2-years of almost daily use I still love this lotion!  Sometimes I&#x27;ll use something else, but the next day I&#x27;m right back to Hempz Original.  It is lightly scented and keeps me moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion and it lasts a long time. Amazon is the best price to buy from too.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer!!!  I was introduced to it while in Nevada, so ordered some when I got home.  I use it all the time, works better than most popular brands.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  You can actually feel it work into your skin and hydrate it very thoroughly.  As long as they keep the price down, I will always purchase this particular product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff my wife love it. Also shipped on time, delivered on time and product is as describe. Just as any one would want.</li>
    <li> Great stuff and who knew there are so many bodily benefits to hemp seed oil! Thanks Hempz, you&#x27;ve got a lifelong client :)</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and this is the only mosturizer I have found to help with that problem.  I higly recomend it to anyone who has dry skin or simply wants softer skin it is a very good product.</li>
    <li> Love love love this lotion feels wonderful and smells great too!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing lotion I have ever used.  The scent is very light and the lotion is so creamy.  There is no residue or oily feeling after you apply it and my skin felt like satin the first day!  Even after five weeks of tanning, I have soft moist skin.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really seen any results from the &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; formula, but that is secondary to the incredible way your skin will feel.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has this for a very good price, especially if you can get free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I also found it at TJ Maxx over the week-end and bought three more bottles, as did my Mom and two sisters.</li>
    <li> love these smells great  and feels good</li>
    <li> I REALLY love this moisturizer.  It leaves my skin very soft; the Age Defying scent of &#x27;Vanilla &amp; Musk&#x27; does not clash with my perfume as the &#x27;Floral &amp; Banana&#x27; scent of the &#x27;original&#x27; formula.  This is an excellent moisturizer that I will recommend to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> I have previously used this lotion.  It has a nice smell to it. It is not greasy and is absorbed easily.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I find the smell refreshing and easily paired with other scents one may like to wear. This is by far the most reasonable price I have found this product for and it arrived quickly and well packaged!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and it keeps her skin very soft and easy on the eye, would recomend this to anyone who&lt;br /&gt;wants smooth skin.</li>
    <li> First time I have used a Hempz Herbal product and I love it!  I saw a large local spa had this also featured for their customers. Thank you!  I will re-order again.</li>
    <li> Besides other potentially harmful ingredients, this product contains Comfrey, which is a known liver toxin EVEN WHEN only applied to the skin (especially over a long period of time).  Physicians warn severely against even topical application of this substance.  I would avoid this moisturizer until they get rid of obvious toxins that shouldn&#x27;t even be applied to the skin, like this one.</li>
    <li> The Best Lotion for soft skin!!</li>
    <li> The smell is wonderful.  Very refreshing scent and light.  Love the texture of my skin since using it for 30 days.  As with any lotion, you have to give it at least 30 days to let it do its work.  I&#x27;m hooked on this!  I have tried so so many others... from the cheapest to the most expensive.  This one is the winner</li>
    <li> This is a great product, my wife loves it, I have bought 3 bottles so far, great product for the skin and nose, yes it smells so different to what I am used to.</li>
    <li> I purchased the wrong one. BUt its still good.</li>
    <li> I received the product fast and I love the moisturizer it makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Good soft scented moisturizer.  Would recommend this product for anyone to use.</li>
    <li> A good product for everyday use.  I prefer the &amp;#34;age defying&amp;#34; formula over the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; strictly because of the scent.  I tried some of the other scents and had to give them away because they were too strong.  This one is really nice and light.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this if you like the original Hemp lotion smell. Smells nothing like it. If you asked me, I&#x27;d say the smell is Age Embracing! I&#x27;d rather rub on me some Medicated Gold Bond. Shame on you Hempz</li>
    <li> Gifted this to my mom and she couldn&#x27;t get enough. Her husband even tried to steal it! I used it on my sunburned shoulders and it was the best thing I tried. Now that I think about it, I&#x27;m going to buy myself some!</li>
    <li> This lotion really moisturizes! I use it after tanning and after shaving and it leaves my skin nice and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t burn on razor cuts, which I love! Sometimes you don&#x27;t notice that you cut yourself a bit until you go moisturize, well, not with this lotion! It doesn&#x27;t sting. The smell is ok, I don&#x27;t love the plant scent, but I do love the lotion!</li>
    <li> Love the way it easily goes into the skin and leaves a cool feeling afterwards.  Nice product will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is Wonderful Lotion at a fair pice....it works well!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of the Hempz lotion for awhile and this is my favorite one. The scent is subtle but great. I love the consistency and absorbtion. It is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave you shinny.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I like the feel and scent of this lotion and it does not leave me feeling greasy whatsoever. It does have a lot of good, natural, plant-based essential oils and good stuff. However, it also has a lot of bad ingredients in it. Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), Parabens, and other bad stuff. Seeing as how these are mostly (but not 100%) in the product listing - I&#x27;ve only just been reading about these chemicals as of recent. If I had researched this before I saw this product, then I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Some commenters have mentioned that the formula has changed since I wrote this review. I&#x27;m not going to research it again as I&#x27;ve found brands that I am happy with, but that is something you may want to look into.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, absorbs quickly, and doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell... This lotion is just what I was looking for! My skin looks so much healthier that I bought a second bottle.</li>
    <li> Very nice, light and smooth lip balm that doesn&#x27;t cake up.It feels good and looks good both under and over lipstick</li>
    <li> If you go to the product website, it lists all kinds of natural ingredients and says it does not have any parabens, giving you the impression that is made of healthy ingredients.  Unfortunately when you read the very small fine printed list of ingredients you see that depending on what type you bought it has Yellow #5, Yellow #6 and the Cucumber and Jasmine lotion has Blue1 in it as well.  All of which are actually banned in close to 100 other countries.  Just because our FDA doesn&#x27;t care about our health as much as they care about big business, I thought this company was above that greedy approach to business.</li>
    <li> Not greasy at all.  I love the smell.  I never feel dry when I use this moisturizer.  All natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have always been a big fan of the Hempz product line and love the original Hempz lotion and lip balm. The smell of the original is probably my favorite but this lotion has a very light, clean, fresh smell and leaves you feeling so soft! I have very sensitive skin and have reactions to a lot of smells and lotions, but I used this product last night after showering all over and had no itchy reaction! It absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky or slimey, it instantly made my skin soft and smooth felt great to apply. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best skin lotion you can buy. It smells good and soaks into your skin leaving no sticky residue. Love it and will continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> Love this! I was a little nervous because some ppl didnt like the smell... but I love the smell! it is hard to describe, but definitely NOT fruity or flowery (which i hate fruity smells) ... I can see how some people might not like it...it is a clean, soap-like smell, not over powering and fades quickly enough.</li>
    <li> Love it, such a great, clean smell.  No fragrance, just very pleasing and refreshing.  Costs $25.00 at local store for hair and skin products.  Much better buy through Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is not the product in the bottle that Age Defying is supposed to be. It smells like the strong, cheap lotion used in nail salons. It is very thin and watery. I have used this product for years. This is not it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love, and smells naturally wonderful, without a perfume smell.</li>
    <li> I love this brand.  This works really well and immediately works off dead skin.  Love the fragrance.  So fresh.  Makes my skin so soft.  It is getting better looking but I don&#x27;t know about the age defying part.  I have had a lot of health issues since cancer surgery and treatments so my skin/body has taken a beating but this makes my skin feel really nice.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this lotion for the whole body.  It leaves skin soft and smooth.  As long as Hempz continues to make this product, I will continue to buy it</li>
    <li> There is nothing about this that I don&#x27;t like. It smells good, it works and it will turn dry shedding skin into smooth, but not oily, skin in no time at all. Try this. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> left my skin feeling very soft and moursurized, I&#x27;m in the sun alot so I applied morining and night. I could tell a difference in my skin after only 2 days of use.</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizing lotion.  There is no scent and does not leave a greasy residue.  I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> love supre products.. love hemp products.. if your tanning used it twice a day otherwise once a day will keep you soft and hydrated.. even in the high desert climate like Colorado Springs</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and now my husband loves this stuff ... now I am buying 3 at a time!  Thanks, Lisa</li>
    <li> Love the smell and makes the skin feel smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion and it works great!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion.  I keep a bottle at home in the bathroom and a second in my car.  It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t clump or peel if you get too much.  Soaks in nicely!  Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance so it&#x27;s not overwhelming.  Just a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower.  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Really love the way this product absorbs into my skin without a greasy feel with a light. delicate fragrance that is very soothing!</li>
    <li> Definitely had to try Hempz after it was recommended to me by my own mom. I have not used this specific &amp;#34;Age Defying&amp;#34; lotion long enough to notice any firming results, but I have noticed how remarkably soft and moisturized my skin looks, even after a long day! I am a waitress, so I am constantly washing my hands, causing them to be very dry. However, this lotion definitely helped solve my problem, without leaving a greasy and uncomfortable feel after applying. My skin soaks it right up and absorbs it all, leaving behind only soft skin. Love it! By far my new favorite lotion. I&#x27;ve already bought three!</li>
    <li> So I bought a small bottle of this at ULTA and I fell instantly in love with the brand! The lotion smells soooo good and really makes my hands soft. I am a nurse and I am constantly putting lotion on my hands and this is perfect. All of my co-workers also always want to use it all the time. A++++</li>
    <li> I am adament that there are no chemicals and that the product contains only.healthy products. This does not disappoint. The lotion is thick and creamy and absorbs quickly. Mg skin feels fantastic</li>
    <li> I am not a lotion person. I hate the feeling it leaves, but my skin drinks this in! Its got a great scent that lasts ALL DAY! My skin also stays hydrated all day...no need for anything else.  I also use this on my face, if I am extra dry, and I do not break out.  I break out every easily, but with this I am fine.  Love it!</li>
    <li> great product!!!! Thank YOu! Will buy again when running low :) My favorite brand of lotions out there! Never will go back to store brand!</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Smells great and the scent lingers all day!</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion ever!</li>
    <li> The first bottle didn&#x27;t make here safely - rainstorm disintegrated the packing - however, the one I have now is perfect.  Best moisturizer I have ever tried for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion the best I ever tried...and I had dry skin now I don&#x27;t! enjoying the earths goodness on my skin!</li>
    <li> This makes my face feel nice and smooth. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on your face or that you rubbed vasoline on you face look. The smell is nice too. Now lets hope it smooths some of my wrinkles. :)</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and nothing has been able to help me, even products recommended by my doctor. I tried this product and I saw improvement immediately. With continued use, my dry skin is completely gone.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  Great for dry skin and smells great.  I would buy again. Not a bad price either.</li>
    <li> The taste is really good. I only would take these after a really hard workout because it&#x27;s just so much shake too put down. Overall if you&#x27;re trying to get big this is the proper amount. Lot of protein and definitely very filling. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
    <li> The Hempz line is overall very excellent and very budget friendly. A little goes a long way. I recommend trying anything from this brand. The original scent is very light and pleasing.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has changed my life! (well, my legs and booty anyway) It is much more firming than any other firming lotion I have tried (including Nivea, Aveeno, Jergens and Palmer) After about a month of continuous use, I noticed my stretch marks faded and my cellulite had significantly reduced. Unfortunately it is not a permanent solution, if I stop using it for a month or two my skin goes back to how it was- I&#x27;ll probably be buying this lotion for the rest of my life. Thanks, HempZ!</li>
    <li> So glad to find this cult classic, much loved &amp;very good body lotion here on Amazon at such a great price!&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive, sometimes reactive , always dry skin. This moisturizes without being gooey or feeling like your skin can&#x27;t breathe or leaving a &amp;#34;haunting&#x27; fragrance. Helps with the winter, dry air itchies.&lt;br /&gt;arrived ontime, packed well&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. This was a reorder. I&#x27;ve used it before and had to get more</li>
    <li> definately a smoooth product, good smell and adequate hydration, would order again for sure. good price for the size and benefits</li>
    <li> This I love. Love the clean smell it has. Makes my skin feel good. Lady at work had some and let me try it. Use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product &amp; seller!</li>
    <li> This has turned out to be one of the best lotions I&#x27;ve used. I have dermatitis which makes my skin terribly dry and flaky. Every lotion I have used just soaks in and I have to use more in just a few min. I put this on and it absorbs but leaves my skin looking so nice and feeling nice instead of dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this lotion. Has a light fragrance to it that doesn&#x27;t irritate my senses. I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to scents. Keeps my skin soft and smooth doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. My favorite lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It is moisturizing and smells great!</li>
    <li> Different smell than the regular lotion, but works well.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing, smell could be better</li>
    <li> Shipping was really fast. Just FYI the Age Defying does not smell as yummy as the regular. I am a huge fan of the regular one so I was a little disappointed but I do still like it.</li>
    <li> I like it, but my son and his girlfriend aren&#x27;t crazy about the one I gave them. They don&#x27;t like the smell or feel.</li>
    <li> this product feels really good on my skin. It&#x27;s not oily and my skin is soft with it...the only problem is that I think it smells very bad. It&#x27;s my first time buying it.  I ordered this online based on all the great reviews.  I am wondering if I got a &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; product or I got the real Hempz... I am planning  to go in store to smell the product and see if it&#x27;s the same odor. If it is, I would not buy it again</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! Great results on my skin its not too greasy just perfect. Using it continously will give you better results.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is perfect.  It dries quick which is helpful when a person is short on time.</li>
    <li> I really like the Hempz lotion and so does my husband and daughter.  I am not sure about the age defying part of it yet  since I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  I am also not as fond of the smell as some of the other ones but it is ok.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I was visiting a family member in California last November, and completely spaced on bringing/buying my own body lotion. After my first shower at her place, my cousin handed me several lotions, and one after another I ket handing them back to her. Some were too thick, some too greasy, some just didn&#x27;t smell nice. This one, however, nailed it on the head for me. It is super light, smells great, and won&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky. It&#x27;s a must have whether your in a beautiful and sunny state like California or whether you live in the south like me.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product that I have used for years.  Recently having broken out in eczema, I needed something quick that would do the trick in a short period of time.  I happened to have Hempz lotion in a small container that I grabbed in desperation.  It WORKED!  As a result, I ordered the 17 oz bottle and have enjoyed the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside - the order was for the regular moisturizer (as you can see from the list above) - I received the Pomegranite scented moisturizer instead.  While I don&#x27;t mind the scent, I was disappointed the seller didn&#x27;t fulfill my order as placed.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for several years and love it more all the time! It has a light clean scent, but most importantly, leaves my skin feeling soft and moistened without the heavy, oily feel of so many other lotions. I highly recommend this lotion for anyone with dry skin. My daughter refuses to use anything else on her baby&#x27;s skin!</li>
    <li> Great lotion that truly makes your skin soft, I think its wonderful body creme!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff...does a great job of firming skin as well as moisturizing.  I use it for certain areas since I&#x27;ve lost a considerable amount of weight and it seems to be smoothing and firming together.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the scent it leaves on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand and body cream ever, It works great!! I have given it as gifts to all my family and friends, everyone always ask for it. Try it you won&#x27;t use another brand. You can purchase other brands but they just don&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> This is the best moistuizer ever the smell is amazing</li>
    <li> I first bought this moisturizer at my hairdresser&#x27;s shop for $26.00.  I loved it.  Then I saw it on Amazon for less then half price.  I bought 4 bottles.  This moisturizer smells like fresh air/clean smelling, no over flowering.  My skin is much softer and I am 67 years old.  I use it on my whole body and it just feels soooo good and fresh.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is not greasy or sticky.  Works well for me and my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Favorite Moisturizer,  Awesome scent. Im hooked. :)</li>
    <li> it makes your skin feel silky soft</li>
    <li> A very good lotion! Soaked in quickly and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> As expected, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This lotion from Hempz is the bomb! Meaning it leaves you hydrated and soft.</li>
    <li> The smell took some getting use to, but the lotion absorbs quickly, this was important to me. Will purchase again, and possibly other fragrances by this company.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I will use, jt doesn&#x27;t leave that oily residue that other lotions leave. It is perfect for my dry skin in the cold dry mountain air.</li>
    <li> The best hand lotion for dry skin</li>
    <li> My favorite line of lotions. Smells great and moisturizes all day long! I prefer this more classic smell versus all the other scents they have come out with.</li>
    <li> i just tried this lotion for the first time and love it, goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, doesnt have a strong smell, and i feel so moisturized :)</li>
    <li> The smell is great and doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on my body.  I use it daily and my skin feels soft.  This is something I will buy again.</li>
    <li> For anyone that has vey dry skin this product will help.  I can really see the help it lends during these cold months.</li>
    <li> Pump does not work well, it quits working before bottle is empty.  Happened on several bottles of this product.  Moisturizer is good.</li>
    <li> Creamy, very light scent, softens skin.</li>
    <li> Great product. Great pricing.</li>
    <li> I love the Hempz Herbal Moisturizer!  It&#x27;s now the only lotion I use.  My friends love the smell and have asked me what I&#x27;m using, so I have begun giving this product as gifts!</li>
    <li> I use a lot of items from the helps line &amp; was using the hydro silk lotion before.  I like that this product is lighter than the standard hempz lotion goes on lightly &amp; hydrates really well. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Good product, had purchased before somewhere else for more money. I would buy again here. Prompt service</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting quick service great product.</li>
    <li> This has a very gentle, fresh scent to it and soaks in right away, isn&#x27;t too thick. The hemp oil is great for my winter - chapped hands!</li>
    <li> Smells great. I have noticed a great difference in my skin over the past 2 weeks. I will continue you to buy and use.</li>
    <li> I received all three in a well packed box. I love the smell and the smoothness of its creamy touch. I keep one bottle at the office, one near my bed and another in the living room. *I must say that not all like the smell of this products. But for me, it is great. I also use it for my feet as my skin get really dry.</li>
    <li> I do not feel any sticky on my skin. It keep my skin really smooth and look remove the wrinkles from the dried skin caused. My bf likes the fragrant and looking on my skin also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Wonderful hydrating cream with a pleasant yet not overwhelming scent.</li>
    <li> I liked the scent, consistency and how well it seemed to work, but I can&#x27;t understand why I should have to wrestle the last 1/4 of the product out of the bottle (pump issues).  Too frustrating.  Will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great. I usually go with the original and wanted to switch it up so I tried out the age defying. I like that its light and absorbs quickly but still works to soften and firm skin . My only complaint is the smell. I thought the product was expired when i got it - because i was expecting it to smell similar to the original. I debated returning it  but I  had tested a bottle at a local salon and it had the same smell so i decided to keep it- Im glad i did because it does work really well.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer keeps skin soft and improves appearance of aging skin.  I use it daily on hands, arms, feet and legs.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s not too thick so your hands don&#x27;t end up greasy or oily, but it hydrates well.</li>
    <li> I bought this tanning because I&#x27;ve tried it before from a friend when I did indoor tanning. Now that I am tanning again, I chose to purchase it. It&#x27;s the best lotion ever, no lie. Not greasy, smells great, and moisturizes greatly!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the scent is nice, not overpowering.  I am a repeat customer when it comes to this lotion.  It is especially nice to have in a dry mid-western winter, but I use it all summer as well.</li>
    <li> I use this on my neck, back, face, hands.  All over my body after a good tan session.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and use it everywhere except my face.  I like that they are a cruelty-free company.</li>
    <li> This product had the most horrible scent imaginable, nothing herbal or natural about it but instead smelled like the most nasty old man drugstore counter aftershave imaginable. It might defy age by frightening death away! I&#x27;ve used Hemptz products in the past and can only conclude that the brand is been seriously devalued, nothing like the old product. Also made me incredibly itchy. Into the garbage it goes.</li>
    <li> This is the second hempz lotion I&#x27;ve bought off amazon. The first was the green tea and Asian pear which is good but more summery. This age defying has a more masculine smell at least on my skin and I don&#x27;t need to use colonge.  Already got 2 compliments and I&#x27;ve only wore it one day!</li>
    <li> I love all the Hempz but this one especially because of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it was easier to find locally.</li>
    <li> It is good but the wife doesn&#x27;t look any younger.  Do not think it is all that age defying....</li>
    <li> After using this lotion for one week, it&#x27;s the only lotion I&#x27;ll buy! Leaves my skin soft and fully moisturized for a full 24 hours!</li>
