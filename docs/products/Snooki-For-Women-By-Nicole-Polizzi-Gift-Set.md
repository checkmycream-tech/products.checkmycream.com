    <li> Got this as a bday present for a very special friend. Its all she has been wanting. Love it and everything it comes with. You just cannot beat that price.</li>
    <li> I think if reviewers supplied name of seller they bought their item(s) from it would be extremely useful for a couple of important reasons.1)We would become aware of phony/knockoff/faulty products being sold.2)We would become aware of WHO(Which seller(s) is selling products.3)Depending on buyers review/opinion,others could make a more \\&quot;informed\\&quot;purchase..In THIS particular case,I&#x27;ve read this perfume smells:1)sexy,2)like cupcakes/cotton candy,3)like old ladies..PERSONALLY to me,those(1,2&amp;3)are 3VERY DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT SCENT DESCRIPTIONS&amp;depending on WHAT I like decides my buy right?Here there&#x27;s only2sellers,I was just wondering if the perfume from 1seller smells completely diff than the other..Wouldnt YOU want to kno?Wouldnt YOU want to be able to choose btwn whether your perfume smelled like cupcakes or\\&quot;old lady\\&quot;?Im NOT knocking Amazon,I LOOVE AMAZON!I just believe we ALL deserve a choice of what we want&amp;the best way to do that is by being INFORMED..</li>

    <li> My young niece loves Snookie and even dresses like her. I sent this to her as a Xmas present without ever smelling it. Thankfully it is a scent which she loves and now wears daily, plus she receives compliments on it. I was impressed with the price too and would order again from this company.</li>
    <li> I have bought Snooki&#x27;s perfumes for my niece every year for Christmas since she has come out with her line.  She absolutely loves them and so do I!</li>

    <li> I bought this for my daughter; it was on her Christmas list.  I actually like the scent, it&#x27;s not too strong and has a kind of fresh floral fruit smell.  It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s very pleasant.</li>

    <li> GRANDDAUGHTER IS BIG SNOOKI FAN.</li>
    <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my 18-year-old cousin and she just loved it! It&#x27;s the perfect price for everything that you get.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter. I was Surprised by the sexy  scent. It smells like something Snooky would wear and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gag gift, and - HEY!  The person really DID gag!  It&#x27;s ugly, it smells nasty, the packaging was designed apparently by a 3 year old with some Sharpies and . . . well, it is absolutely a perfect representation of Snooki!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it - give it to your biggest enemy!  Have someone you can&#x27;t shake? - give her this and she&#x27;ll go away and never talk to you again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also kills most insects, and probably small children and animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also may have given me an STD.  Not sure yet.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell of the spray but the lotion I loved.&lt;br /&gt;something that a young teen would like, but not for someone my age.</li>
    <li> Buying this product not knowing how it would smell was a challenge but at the end of the day my wife loved it and it smells really good like cotton candy</li>
    <li> Shipping speed was great! The perfume and body lotion smell amazing and the bracelet was way more than expected. It was pretty sturdy and doesn&#x27;t fall off like most bracelets of its type. Great price for everything you get with it! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
    <li> I love snooki so much! &amp; I love this ... Smells so damn good(:</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift. As soon as it was opened I had to leave the room. The scent smells like cheap cotton candy/sugar/cupcakes. It was nauseating. What more can you expect from &amp;#34;Snooki&amp;#34;?</li>
