      <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
      <li>I was so looking forward to that original Herbal Essence of the 70&#x27;s!</li>
      <li>The original herbal essence shampoo was my favorite shampoo for many years until they discontinued it.</li>
      <li>re-issue their much-loved shampoo with every ingredient of the original recipe intact, in the authentic, iconic bottle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>bottles to try and was really happy that the fragrance was just like the old Herbal Essence shampoo I used as a girl.</li>
      <li>I bought this shampoo like many others did because it was supposed to be close to the smell of the original Herbal Essence shampoo.  </li>
      <li>This smells almost like it, a bit fainter and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to remain in my hair as strongly.  </li>
      <li>but not it and the scent is really strong.</li>
      <li>It cleans fine, but I can&#x27;t get over the dog shampoo undertones.</li>
      <li>Since then, I tried to fine a shampoo that smelled just like it.  </li>
      <li>It is gentle and chock full of good stuff for your hair</li>
      <li>I love the fresh smell of this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>as close to the old, beloved Herbal Essence as I have found.  </li>
      <li>The original smelled heavenly and this smells really good, but nothing like the old one.</li>
      <li>I was on a quest to find the original herbal essence shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a scent of the original Herbal Essence shampoo of the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>this is the closest I have found to be like the original herbal essence.</li>
      <li>This stuff is crap-no resemblance at ALL to the original Clairol Essence shampoo.</li>
      <li>I bought it for the scent, trying to find something that smelled like the original Herbal Essence shampoo.  </li>
      <li>product I&#x27;ve found which comes the closest to the original is Vermont Country Store&#x27;s Country Herbal Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Even if it&#x27;s not the exact scent, I liked it very much.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s true they changed the scent.</li>
      <li>After blow drying, my hair has enough body and shine for me to feel good about the way it looks.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice shampoo but DOES NOT smell like the old Herbal Essence shampoo.</li>
      <li>a blast from the past!It smells so much like the original green Herbal Essence Shampoo,its Great!</li>
      <li>Glee maybe I&#x27;ll shampoo my little Westie with it, so she can smell soooo good too!</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells great but not exactly like Herbal Essence.  </li>
      <li>The scent is very close to the original Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo...not as strong.  </li>
      <li>To be honest I was looking for a product that would replicate the scent and long lasting feeling I enjoyed when Using the old original formula Herbal Essences shampoo before they changed from that wonderful dark green product that smelled of the most wonderful herbal, woodsy, mossy</li>
      <li>I will use it up quickly as body wash and never ever order it again.</li>
      <li>This is too mild,</li>
      <li>I loved that it smelled soooo much like the original Herbal Essence shampoo - the one with the girl shampooing in a waterfall of flowers,  I recently ordered it again</li>
      <li>(I was in college at the time, had very long hair, and LOVED how the fragrance lingered for days.)  </li>
      <li>Thanks for making this shampoo available to us.</li>
      <li>I was trying to purchase a shampoo with the scent of freshly cut grass.</li>
      <li>It is like freshly cut grass on a Spring day.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even smell that remarkable now and could care less if I even use it.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it not smell like the Clairol product I loved in high school, I don&#x27;t even like the scent of it.  </li>
      <li>I put my nose right up the the spout and smelled nothing.  </li>
      <li>It smells like the original and leaves hair silky soft !!!</li>
      <li>The lather is good and my hair is soft and clean with only using the shampoo (I tried it this way to get a real feel for the one product without using anything else in my hair)  </li>
      <li>I bought this because I read that it smelled very much like the 1970&#x27;s shampoo Herbal Essence.</li>
      <li>Smells just like the original Herbalessence, but leaves hair very soft without frizz.</li>
      <li>This one is the real deal!</li>
      <li>And it gives my hair a whole lot of body and shine!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just like the emerald green shampoo I loved so much!</li>
      <li>I bought this after reading reviews that said it smelled EXACTLY like the Clairol Herbal Essence Shampoo of the 70&#x27;s</li>
      <li>This scent is pretty close.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t know exactly what was used, scent.  </li>
      <li>I would not say the scent reminds me too much of the one I miss from long ago, but it is nice.</li>
      <li>MirtaDe Perales Herbal Fresh Shampoo is VERY close to the Clariol brand.</li>
      <li>they hinted the original from the early 1970&#x27;s</li>
      <li>- I used to order the original HerbalEssence Shampoo directly from Clairol.  </li>
      <li>so clearly it did not leak during shipping, the plastic was clean.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re like me and really miss the old Original Herbal Essence shampoo and have been trying to find something that smells close to it....</li>
      <li>This shampoo is easy enough on your hair to use every day.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Seems gentle.  </li>
      <li>I have oily hair,so this worked very well for me.  </li>
      <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and wanted so much to believe the reviewers&lt;br</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t notice the scent on my hair after it dried, but it did a good job cleaning and soft without a conditioner.</li>
      <li>I was looking for something similar to the original Herbal Essence.</li>
      <li>However to go back to this product, I do like the mild scent</li>
      <li>many of us searching for a replica of the original Herbal Essence that for some godforsaken reason Clairol refuses to reinstate, despite an almost cult-like demand for it.</li>
      <li>Mirta De Perales - could you make the bottle look like the old Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo bottle! ? !  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, basic shampoo that cleans my fine hair well without leaving a lot of gunk behind.</li>
      <li>It does get pretty close to that smell, but not exactly...nor did I expect any shampoo to actually have the same exact smell.  </li>
      <li>But I was pleasantly surprised when I used it!</li>
      <li>If anything it does an even better job on my hair than the original (sorry Clairol).</li>
      <li>This shampoo is the exact same scent</li>
      <li>Well, at first sniff it was very similar.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s long lasting scent and how clean, shiny and manageable my hair was.</li>
      <li>Cleans my hair well and leaves it soft.  </li>
      <li>far they haven&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>(the really old Herbal Essence - from the early 70&#x27;s).</li>
      <li>I really like the smell it took me back to when I was 15.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was looking for something similar to the original Herbal Essence. Well, Herbal Essence it ain&#x27;t, but it does vaguely remind me of it. As a shampoo, it is quite good.</li>
    <li> I only gave this 3 stars because for the latest bottle I ordered, I would have given it 1 star - but for the previous orders of the same shampoo - I would have given it 5 stars.  I have been buying this shampoo for several months now.  I loved that it smelled soooo much like the original Herbal Essence shampoo - the one with the girl shampooing in a waterfall of flowers,  I recently ordered it again so I would have some when I ran  out, and  just opened it about a week ago.  It smells COMPLETELY different now,  I am so bummed - and really annoyed.  It doesn&#x27;t even smell that remarkable now and could care less if I even use it.  I will be contacting the seller- but wanted to post this for anyone who hasn&#x27;t yet bought it (or for those thinking of purchasing it again),  I will share what, if any, response that I receive.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is very nice.  The lather is good and my hair is soft and clean with only using the shampoo (I tried it this way to get a real feel for the one product without using anything else in my hair)  After blow drying, my hair has enough body and shine for me to feel good about the way it looks.  To be honest I was looking for a product that would replicate the scent and long lasting feeling I enjoyed when Using the old original formula Herbal Essences shampoo before they changed from that wonderful dark green product that smelled of the most wonderful herbal, woodsy, mossy, I don&#x27;t know exactly what was used, scent.  Why the product line was discontinued, to be replaced by fruity and floral type scents, I will never understand.  However to go back to this product, I do like the mild scent but it is not a scent that lingers at all.  I would not say the scent reminds me too much of the one I miss from long ago, but it is nice. I feel it is a bit high priced for the small bottle.  I might buy more at some point but the shampoo did not turn out to be what I had been looking for when I ordered the product.</li>
    <li> I bought this because the fragrance was supposed to be similar to the Clairol Herbal Essences shampoo from the 70&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t find it to be similar.</li>
    <li> OMG!What a blast from the past!It smells so much like the original green Herbal Essence Shampoo,its Great!</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of others..many of us searching for a replica of the original Herbal Essence that for some godforsaken reason Clairol refuses to reinstate, despite an almost cult-like demand for it. This scent is pretty close. I use an old Herbal Essence bottle and dump this in and I feel like I have my old shampoo back. This version doesn&#x27;t quite leave the same squeaky shine as the Herbal Essence but the scent lingers and does its job.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read that it smelled very much like the 1970&#x27;s shampoo Herbal Essence. The original smelled heavenly and this smells really good, but nothing like the old one. SAD!!!</li>
    <li> It had no fragrance at all.  I put my nose right up the the spout and smelled nothing.  The I even tried washing my hands with it and smelled nothing.  Washed my hair and smelled nothing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this shampoo.  It has a light herbal smell and reminds me just a little of the old herbal essence, but just a little.  Cleans my hair well and leaves it soft.  This shampoo is easy enough on your hair to use every day.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I read a review that the aroma of this product is just like the old Clairol Herbal essence, so I bought 2 of them.&lt;br /&gt;That was a false review of the product I read. It is a nice shampoo but DOES NOT smell like the old Herbal Essence shampoo.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo like many others did because it was supposed to be close to the smell of the original Herbal Essence shampoo.  It does get pretty close to that smell, but not exactly...nor did I expect any shampoo to actually have the same exact smell.  Imagine the Herbal Essence scent, stronger and a little sweeter.  That&#x27;s how it comes across to me.  As for the shampoo itself, it works great and is a fantastic value for the amount you get.  It&#x27;s somewhat concentrated so a little goes a long ways.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and really miss the old Original Herbal Essence shampoo and have been trying to find something that smells close to it....this is the closest I have found yet.  Just keep in mind what I said about it being close but not exact, a little stronger and a little sweeter smelling.</li>
    <li> this is the closest I have found to be like the original herbal essence. it is not as thick or as dark green and a little lighter scent , doesn&#x27;t seem as woodsy.  but about as close as you can get!</li>
    <li> A very nice shampoo.  Seems gentle.  I bought it for the scent, trying to find something that smelled like the original Herbal Essence shampoo.  This smells almost like it, a bit fainter and the scent doesn&#x27;t seem to remain in my hair as strongly.  But it&#x27;s the closest I&#x27;ve found since Vermont Country Store stopped carrying their copy.  I paid $9.00 for it and that&#x27;s a tad pricey for the size of the bottle, which is why I&#x27;ve only given it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Not what I thought. I was trying to purchase a shampoo with the scent of freshly cut grass. This is too mild, almost no scent.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells just like Herbal Essence I really like the smell it took me back to when I was 15.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews which said it smelled like Clairol Herbal Essence original shampoo which I loved both for it&#x27;s long lasting scent and how clean, shiny and manageable my hair was. What a disappointment!  My hair became frizzy with the first use, the smell was only vaguely herbal and did not last at all. One of the worst shampoos I have used in recent memory.</li>
    <li> never buy again, does not smell like the old herbal essence at all. :(</li>
    <li> I love the fresh smell of this shampoo.  It is like freshly cut grass on a Spring day.  I used to get that feeling from Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo - but that product has been discontinued.  Mirta De Perales - could you make the bottle look like the old Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo bottle! ? !  Thanks for making this shampoo available to us.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shampoo that smelled like the Clairol Herbal Essence Shampoo of the 1970&#x27;s. Well, at first sniff it was very similar. But then I noticed that it reminded me of dog shampoo. It cleans fine, but I can&#x27;t get over the dog shampoo undertones. I will probably end up using it on my dogs. I will keep looking for that elusive Herbal Essence scent.</li>
    <li> great product,arrived on time,as advertised and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> The original herbal essence shampoo was my favorite shampoo for many years until they discontinued it. I have been searching for something similar ever since. This shampoo is the exact same scent and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. If anything it does an even better job on my hair than the original (sorry Clairol). It cleans and conditions perfectly- and that&#x27;s coming from someone with long hair that tends to dry on the ends. I already ordered two more bottles- not going to let this one go without a fight!</li>
    <li> Not what I Was looking for. I was hoping it imitated the scent of herbal essence shampoo but, nope.</li>
    <li> as close to the old, beloved Herbal Essence as I have found.  (the really old Herbal Essence - from the early 70&#x27;s).</li>
    <li> But no cigar. This shampoo smells great but not exactly like Herbal Essence.  It is gentle and chock full of good stuff for your hair so I will use it.  My hair is thinning so Im hoping this will help.</li>
    <li> DOES NOT SMELL LIKE HERBAL ESSENCE! As a matter of fact I can hardy detect any aroma. Just wanted to get that out there. I used Herbal Essence in the 70&#x27;s and up until they quit making it, this is nothing like it. Cannot comment on benefits just yet.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in September.  I am 57 and always used the Clairol Herbal Ess.  I love this product and have ordered more.  It smells like the original and leaves hair silky soft !!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice, basic shampoo that cleans my fine hair well without leaving a lot of gunk behind. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out, either. However, it&#x27;s true they changed the scent. Although I didn&#x27;t think it smelled exactly like the old Herbal Essence shampoo before, they were similar in that this used to have a forest/ herbal green scent. It now has a green tea/ citrusy scent. I don&#x27;t mind it, but it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like it did before.</li>
    <li> I am a non-smoker with a perfectly functioning sense of smell, and this shampoo does INDEED smell almost exactly like the original herbal essence. It&#x27;s closer than the now defunct \\&quot;Country herbal\\&quot; shampoo. Do NOT get the Vanart herbal shampoo, it is not close at all. This one is the real deal! Anyone saying it&#x27;s not, has got a problem with their sense of smell.</li>
    <li> I purchased two 8oz. bottles to try and was really happy that the fragrance was just like the old Herbal Essence shampoo I used as a girl. if you are looking for a shampoo that mimics that 70&#x27;s scent then I recommend trying it.</li>
    <li> I am so disappointed! I guess I got a bad batch or newer batch. This has ZERO scent. NOTHING. I will use it up quickly as body wash and never ever order it again. I was so looking forward to that original Herbal Essence of the 70&#x27;s! SO BUMMED!    Oh and shipping was REALLY SLOW. PFffffffffttttttt!</li>
    <li> LOVE the scent of this shampoo...Really good texture as well.  Does a great job and leaves an awesome scent in my hair.  Just can&#x27;t get enough of this shampoo... I love the clean, herbal scent!! So good!</li>
    <li> The scent is very close to the original Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo...not as strong.  Didn&#x27;t notice the scent on my hair after it dried, but it did a good job cleaning and soft without a conditioner.</li>
    <li> - I used to order the original HerbalEssence Shampoo directly from Clairol.  But, that didn&#x27;t last too long.  Since then, I tried to fine a shampoo that smelled just like it.  Actually... it&#x27;s not for me, but for my fussy husband who can&#x27;t stand the fruity scents of the shampoos that have flooded the markets.  I also don&#x27;t like my hair to smell like coconut or mango or any of those other scents.&lt;br /&gt;  The Vermont Country Store actually sells an herbal shampoo that is supposed to smell like the old Herbal Essence.  It even comes in the same shaped bottle.  But, it didn&#x27;t even come close to the scent.&lt;br /&gt;  Then, I found Mirta&#x27;s in a beauty supply store.  I found this one to be the closest thing to Herbal Essence.  My husband likes it, too, which accounts for something.  He&#x27;s fussy.&lt;br /&gt;  PS... I am also a dog groomer and I don&#x27;t think it smells at all like dog shampoo.  But, I wouldn&#x27;t mind using it on dogs.  It would make them smell so good.</li>
    <li> I loved the Clairol Herbal Essence shampoo of the &#x27;70&#x27;s (I was there!) and wanted so much to believe the reviewers&lt;br /&gt;who wrote that the Mirta De Perales product smelled the same. But it doesn&#x27;t. As a shampoo, it works reasonably&lt;br /&gt;well to cleanse and moisturize. But the scent is harsh and chemical, something you might find in a cleanser&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;d use to scrub the bathroom. Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product I&#x27;ve found which comes the closest to the original is Vermont Country Store&#x27;s Country Herbal Shampoo. It&lt;br /&gt;really was a  very good copy. But it&#x27;s been discontinued. All Clairol has to do to make many, many customers happy&lt;br /&gt;is re-issue their much-loved shampoo with every ingredient of the original recipe intact, in the authentic, iconic bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So far they haven&#x27;t. Go figure.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the original Herbalessence, but leaves hair very soft without frizz.</li>
    <li> I will admit I was skeptical that this shampoo was like the Clairol Herbal Essence Shampoo I had used as a girl. But I was pleasantly surprised when I used it! It&#x27;s just like the emerald green shampoo I loved so much! And it gives my hair a whole lot of body and shine! Not to mention the heavenly fragrance lasts!  I&#x27;m going to order more! This stuff is a keeper...and I&#x27;m a hard person to impress!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews that said it smelled EXACTLY like the Clairol Herbal Essence Shampoo of the 70&#x27;s (I was in college at the time, had very long hair, and LOVED how the fragrance lingered for days.)  Unfortunately, THIS shampoo seams to be a wierd, watered down version.  I gave it three stars because It is just so-so, but there are plenty of so-so shampoos at my local Walmart, and for a LOT less  money, too!</li>
    <li> First of all when it arrived the bottle was not full, the level was at least 1+ inches down and the outside was sticky, even though it was wrapped up tightly in plastic wrap....so clearly it did not leak during shipping, the plastic was clean. I have a feeling I was sent a used bottle that had been returned.  I was looking for a scent of the original Herbal Essence shampoo of the 1970&#x27;s. This one is somewhat close but not it and the scent is really strong. Because of the fact it arrived in the state I described I am uneasy about using it so probably won&#x27;t.  Definitely a disappointment and money wasted.</li>
    <li> I was on a quest to find the original herbal essence shampoo. I tried the brand from Vermont Country Store-- it is missing the secret ingredient. After doing research on Amazon.com. seems like I&#x27;am not the only one!  This brand MirtaDe Perales Herbal Fresh Shampoo is VERY close to the Clariol brand. Even if it&#x27;s not the exact scent, I liked it very much. Nice clean smell. I have oily hair,so this worked very well for me.  I contacted clariol by Facebook  they hinted the original from the early 1970&#x27;s might be making a comeback. ( don&#x27;t hold your breath, til then I&#x27;ll be happy with this brand.) did I read someone compared it to dog soap?  Glee maybe I&#x27;ll shampoo my little Westie with it, so she can smell soooo good too!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that smells like Clairol&#x27;s Herbal Essence from the 70&#x27;s.  Some of the reviewers seemed to think this product had a similar scent.  Not only does it not smell like the Clairol product I loved in high school, I don&#x27;t even like the scent of it.  I used it a few times, but the remainder is going to the church rummage sale.</li>
    <li> This stuff is crap-no resemblance at ALL to the original Clairol Essence shampoo. Save your money and buy ANYTHING at the drugstore. I bought 4 bottles; leaving them for the grandkids. I would have put zero stars but I had to put at least one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Amazon, unhappy customer.</li>
