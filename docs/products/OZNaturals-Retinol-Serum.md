<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this serum starts as a gel and then quickly turns into a liquid which is really nice on the skin and soaks in nicely with a matte finish. it comes with fsntastics organic ingredients and what a fantastic price. I have been uding this product for a several weeks and I have to say I love this!!, my skin is getting smoother, clearer, not dry, hydrated. Im 30 yrs old so I start to care my skin with OZ Natural products, people say I look younger... thank you Oz natural!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum, it&#x27;s light and not greasy. I see great results after using twice a day, it make me look younger.</li>
    <li> Saw no difference after using for more than a month!</li>
    <li> I so love all of these products. As I add each product to my daily skin care regimen, the better they all work. Used in the order suggested, the layering makes each additional product that much more effective. I have never u.s. retinol product before and I admit I was afraid that it would sting or aggravate my super sensitive skin, but it did not at all. My skin has never felt and looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; “I received this product in exchange for an honest review.”</li>
    <li> Works great! As described. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> After using it for 1 month, twice a day, a.m. and  p.m., I see absolutely no change with wrinkles or skin tone. I am 63 and believed the reviews for people about my age or older and definitely did not see any results whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Face looks a lot smoother</li>
    <li> This is a powerful Retinol Serum, but yet it is gentle on my skin without the excessive drying. I use this along with the Vitamin C serum &amp;amp; have seen some amazing results in my skin tone &amp;amp; texture.  Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!  BY FAR THE BEST RETINOL PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.  I COMBINE THIS WITH MY ISOMERS PRODUCTS.  THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN AMAZING.  WILL NOT BE WITHOUT THIS.  I HAVE VERY SENSITIVE SKIN, THIS WORKS GREAT AT NIGHT.  I COMBINE THIS WITH A MIDNIGHT RECOVERY OIL. THEN COMBINE THREE OF ISOMERS CREAMS ON TOP.  IN THE MORNING MY SKIN IS REFRESHED AND PLUMP AND JUICY.  LOVE IT!!  I HAVE THIS ON THE TOP OF MY WISH LIST AND ORDER IT WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT SELLS OUT SO QUICKLY.  CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT!!!</li>
    <li> ANOTHER UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist told me that unless a Vitamin C serum contained the L-ascorbic acid form of Vitamin C, I was wasting my money and doing little to improve my skin.  I found a serum here on Amazon that contains 17% L-ascorbic acid, and I&#x27;ve been using it for approx. 3 weeks.  What a difference!  I can definitely feel it working for one thing (it burns for about 5 seconds), but more importantly, I can SEE the difference in my skin already.  At first I thought my eyesight was going downhill, but then I realized my skin really did look smoother and had a new glow.  Do an Amazon search for L-ascorbic Vitamin C serum to get the good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all this, I have added a LOT more spinach to my daily regimen lately, so I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s contributing to my skin&#x27;s appearance too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished the bottle which gave me about 5 weeks of use.  If it made any difference in my skin, it&#x27;s at a microscopic level.  I&#x27;m buying another bottle - mainly because there&#x27;s got to be SOME truth to all the 5-star reviews.  But if, after another month or so of use, I still don&#x27;t see improvement in my skin, I&#x27;m asking a dermatologist for a Rx for Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for three weeks, and I have yet to see any improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;m amazed (and not a little skeptical) about some people seeing results in two weeks.  I also wonder how many 5-star reviews were written by people who were given the product to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very methodical about using new products on my skin.  I use a 10x magnifying mirror, establish a &amp;#34;baseline&amp;#34; area of my skin to observe over time, and take close-up &amp;#34;selfies&amp;#34; of my skin to compare with photos taken a few weeks later.  No difference so far, but I&#x27;ll continue to use this product until it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO like that this retinol doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, which is highly unusual.  So unusual, it makes me wonder if it indeed contains any retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, and not a critique of the product itself, but the product won&#x27;t dispense through the pump.  It&#x27;s too thick.  I&#x27;m having to pull the cap off and shake the serum on to my fingertips. I wish it came with a dropper instead.  I changed out out the pump with a dropper from another bottle of serum.  I&#x27;m surprised I haven&#x27;t read about this problem in other reviews. Another reason I&#x27;m leery of all the glowing comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update with my progress, or lack thereof, at a later date.uct itself, but the product won&#x27;t dispense through the pump.

    <li> Miracle in a bottle right here. Works wonderfully around the eyes. I can&#x27;t find it anymore though. What happened??</li>
    <li> I am really not noticing any change with this product.  I have used it as directed.  I would not purchase again, nor would I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> An excellent product at a great price . Within a week my skin looked more even and clear and after about 2 weeks It seemed to be clearing my mild Acne Rosacea. I don&#x27;t know if it can rescue me from old bagdom ... but it appears to be stalling further decay</li>
    <li> I am so impressed, I have fair skin, just reached 50 and was seeing fine wrinkle lines from sun damage and , yes, aging. I have been using this product since mid-Februaryand in addition to  the other Oz products my skin looks great! I have struggled lifelong to find products for my fair, acne prone, sensitive skin. I can fairly say the redness on my cheeks has been cut in half, and I feel I look younger just from the plump deweyness the products have given back to my facial skin. I use this Retinol Serum alternating with the Retinal Moisturizer either in AM or PM over the Vitamin C serum(once a day for this one) I then use 2x a day the Sea Infused Face Moisturizer. Its working great this regimen. I will continue to add products but I have had no problems with any reactions, dry skin, tightness, redness.....nothing. I wish I had found these products in my 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s. A deal for the price, I have tried SOOO many more expensive products with bad reactions or no improvement.</li>
    <li> Excellent product...........</li>
    <li> I used it twice a day after exfoliating my skin. Did not see any notable difference after 30 days. Felt a slight tingling sensation but I think that was the sermon on my face for about five minutes.this is the first serum I&#x27;ll try and will try again with other products to find the right balance. If anybody knows of any sermon that actually works please let me know thank you guys</li>
    <li> I am seeing a slight positive difference though im not finished with the bottle. Ty</li>
    <li> This is definetly the best retinol serum that I have ever used.  Some mornings I can feel the dead skin on my face when I  rub it.... then actually see it when I use the wash cloth. Hope to see the wrinkiles disappear soon!!</li>
    <li> I order this product with the HC serum a week ago because I felt in love with oz natural eye gel and vit c serum and they are the BEST products I ever used. So, I decided to try their other products and I have to admit their products are AMAZING. This together with HC serum make my skin super soft and It is only one week of use. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after few months :)))</li>
    <li> I am 57, and have always been searching for &amp;#34;holy grails&amp;#34; in cosmetics and anti-aging products. Lo and behold, I stumbled across this product on Amazon. After using it for several days, I can understand the rave reviews. I have been fortunate to look very young for my age, and this product no doubt, will certainly help keeping that in check ! It goes on so smoothly, with a very pleasant smell. It just feels fresh and clean.I also noticed it was filled up to the &amp;#34; tippy top &amp;#34;, making me smile :-) I suspect from other reviews, that the OZ Naturals staff and owners are highly passionate about their business. I feel that I can trust all of their products easily, as their Sea Infused Herbal Moisturizer is also a top shelf product. Both products rival some of the top boutique names out there with much bigger price tags. Hats off to a company that puts out products that are exceptional with a sensitive price point !!! 10 stars.</li>
    <li> Since using the OZ skin care line I can honestly announce that I am reaping the benefits of clearer, firmer, toner, more glowing skin.  The retinol in this formula does not bother my sensitive skin at all. I was a little anxious about using it on my face and especially around my lips and eyes, but found absolutely no irritation or redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am seeing a marked improvement in my skin and have had a number of people tell me that my skin looked &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34;.  Its nice to have what I believe acknowledged, but its me who is the happiest about how this skin care line helps me achieve healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I cleanse my face in the morning, apply the serum, and then moisturize. The serum goes on smoothly and diminishes the appearance of my \\&quot;smile\\&quot; wrinkles near the outer corners of my mouth and eyes.</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new Retinol Serum and I was super excited to give this a go as I&#x27;m a big fan of Oz Naturals. I started using it about two weeks ago, I thought that was a decent amount of time to see some changes and I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it at night, it&#x27;s the last step in my routine. So far I wake up with plump, hydrated, dewy skin. I do have a little bit of PIH from preexisting breakouts and it&#x27;s helped lighten up my acne marks. I also tend to have dark circles under my eyes, and it helps tremendously with that issue as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The best ever! I love all the OZ Naturals products for the way they work but mostly for the ingredients. Hence how well they work! No toxins for your body to deal with just natural and effective organic ingredients. Stay away from all the sugar this holiday season use OZ Naturals and you will see the results in your skin. People compliment me all the time on how nice my skin looks now. This serum feels wonderful on. I put it on after toner and before moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I saw no real change or improvement to my skin. Actually, it broke me out but its my fault.  I guess its not for men LOL...</li>
    <li> The older I get, the more I realize that my skin is not what it used to be even ten years ago.  I am 42 but you can bet that between wrinkles and crows feet, I will go down kicking and screaming fighting the aging process.  I am a devoted OZ Naturals user.  Although I have only been using this retinol serum for a few days, I can already see a marked difference in the way my skin looks and feels. There are times my skin is normal and then times that it is sensitive and I must tell you that regardless of what my skin feels like doing on any given day, this retinol serum gives me the results I&#x27;m looking for.  This serum seems to work better than a lot that I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  I think it smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t have a sticky feeling to it, which is something I really love.  When dispensed onto your hand, the serum is an Amber gold color. When applied to your face, it soaks immediately into your skin to give a glow to it.  Finally, when it is dry, it leaves almost a matte appearance. I usually use Oz Naturals tonic (which is a spray), followed by this serum and finally with a moisturizer.  I live in the desert and a very dry climate so with all of the Oz Naturals products that I use together, it leaves my skin moisturized and glowing each and every day.  I usually use this serum two times a day, once in the morning and once in the evening as part of my morning and nightly skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always impressed with Oz Naturals products because they not only work, but are made in the USA (I try to buy USA made products at every opportunity), they are not tested on animals and they are 100% Vegan.  Oz Naturals retinol serum is clinical strength containing the highest retinol concentration at 2.5% and includes Astaxanthin and Vitamin E, two powerful antioxidants. This is one company that really cares about their customers and has their customers best interests at heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about Oz Naturals&#x27; products, there is always a money back guarantee, so there is always insurance in the event it doesn&#x27;t happen to work for you. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the results you will get in a very short amount of time.guarantee, so there is always insurance in the event it doesn&#x27;t happen to work for you. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the results you will get in a very short amount of time.</li>
    <li> Wow powerful results. My results are with using this product for less than a week. It is a powerful serum. I can feel the tighten of the skin. It feels like my skin is lifting. This is showing people that I am not looking as tired as before. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! When all honestly I am more tired. So if you can fool the world I am all for it. The serum is nice not sticky and after being on feels smooth on my skin. The vitamin e helps with making my skin look like its glowing and healthy.</li>
    <li> I was originally very excited to receive this product and used it as directed for several days eager to see the promised improvement to my skin.  However, on the fourth day of using this product, I peered into the mirror to be greeted by a nose swamped with black-heads and congested pores.  (I was a bit shocked, as I have not had difficulty with this for over a decade...I am 32 years old.)&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I discontinued use immediately and my it took approximately 2 weeks for my skin to recover.</li>
    <li> Not seeing any improvements and frustrated by promises.  Will keep looking for something else.</li>
    <li> Wow, I am amazed. In just one application I can not only feel the difference but my face looks different. It is smoother and has less red. I am really really happy.</li>
    <li> It is orange. Yes this serum isn&#x27;t clear it is dark orange. I was surprised when I used the pump for the first time. The great news, it doesn&#x27;t turn your skin orange. Hey the other good news, it works and it feels really good on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is pretty. OZ Naturals does a great job with the color of their labels. This is a pretty red and stands out from their other products. The serum has no odor. It feels wonderful going on. Once it is absorbed, my skin has a matte finish and a glow. Moisturizers are the best things to use after applying this serum. It tingles a little bit on tender areas. I like to use it after shaving on my neck to prevent itching and razor burn. It feels good everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
    <li> I swear I noticed an improvement in my skin after the first use! I have been using it along with toner and moisturizer from oz naturals. I love it!</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Retinol serum as I am with all of their products that I have used.  My skin has not looked this good in years!  My pores are smaller and my wrinkles are diminishing.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This serum leaves my skin feeling a little sticky for a few hours after application. The minor scent is not noticeable soon after you apply it.</li>
    <li> I love this retinol serum!  Another great new product from Oz Naturals!</li>
    <li> Have been using daily for nearly 2 weeks. No difference yet. Fingers crossed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*It is light, dries quickly, and has a mild scent.</li>
    <li> Works well. My complexion has improved. The only question I have is why they chose to put polysorbate 20 in the mix. I have read that this ingredient is bad for you. Sad about that since I like Oz Naturals products.</li>
    <li> Very gentle yet effective product....I use it all over my face except for my eye lids....worth the purchase</li>
    <li> I usually give 4 or 5 star ratings out like candy, but when I saw the new, exorbitant price on this &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; I had to laugh. This is way too watery for a serum, way too hyped, and now way too over-priced! I think it&#x27;s ridiculous how some sellers think they can raise the price overnight for their mediocre product and think consumers will be hoodwinked (I paid $25 for this product). I used Oz Naturals Retinol Serum for a few weeks and saw no noticeable improvement, except for a slightly orange-ish shine that lasted a few hours. Even if this product returned to its original price of $25, there are better priced, more effective products out there. We often forget the role good nutrition plays in healthy looking skin. One product that works from the inside out is Astaxanthin gel capsules -- it has helped even my skin tone and I am pleased with the results. As for OZ Naturals, I am not impressed with their products nor their marketing tactics.</li>
    <li> I love this brand and the results I&#x27;ve had with this have been pretty brilliant so far. (I&#x27;m only two weeks in)  I will continue to use this brand for all my skincare needs!</li>
    <li> It smells okay, I actually saw a little peeling, but no major changes. I used the whole bottle. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I think this product was alright... I combined it with a couple other products, so I can&#x27;t give an review about the results.  BUT, when the bottle got to about 1/3 full, it was so thick it would not come out anymore.  I had kept the plastic top on this bottle besides the five seconds it took, morning and night, to apply the product, so I am stumped as to how it could have dried out so drastically.  When I took the sprayer part off the bottle to try to get the rest out, it was just thick globs of product.  I had to add some purified water to try to dilute it, then, (frustratingly), spilled it on the counter, wasting 1/3 of the 25.00 bottle.  I am pretty bummed about this.</li>
    <li> Did absolutely nothing!!</li>
    <li> No results so far.  Maybe it takes longer to work.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product - been using for just 2 weeks and really notice the difference in my skin!  LOVE!!</li>
    <li> I have received the Retinol Serum, but have not had enough time to really test it.  Will add to review when I have given the product a true test. But will add stars later.Okay can&#x27;t submit without star rating, so I will give it four stars now, in hopes of adding a star later.    Okay here is my review.  After using this product for a couple weeks, I find my skin looks much smoother, fewer lines are visible, at least it seems to me that some of the small crows feet around the eyes have lessened; also the frown lines between the eyebrows appear to be less noticeable.  I am very pleased with this serum and plan to continue to use it.    I recommend this product to anyone wanting the same results I have received. Warning though, please be sure to use sunscreen when using these products, as your skin is more susceptible to the sun.</li>
    <li> Always follow directions when applying products to your face that is how you will get maximum results.  I got this product to do an honest and review. I tried this product and really did not know what I expected but the results I am getting after only a few days are amazing.  I do however need to get some sunscreen. Only because it says and Iam one for directions.. lol.  But really this has made quite the difference in my fine lines on the forehead and by my eyes. I am extremely excited to see what happens in another  week.  Thank you !</li>
    <li> Makes my face feel smooth &amp; long term it has given me a good complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the Oz products , I have used most expensive products, this is totally different, try it ,to see for yourself</li>
    <li> Quick delivery Seems to have a positive on my skin.</li>
    <li> I found this product on Amazon when I did a search for cruelty-free skin care. I was feeling fairly desperate about my aging skin, fine lines above my lip, crows feet - I wasn&#x27;t looking on the outside the way I feel on the inside. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle, just some hope! Honestly, using this product had a greater impact on me than I was expecting. My skin improved, to my eyes, within a week. It&#x27;s not a face lift, I&#x27;m still older ;) but I just feel better.  From a bottle of serum. Yay!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I use it in conjunction with OZ Vitamin C Serum  I have only been using these products for about a month now and I am starting to notice a difference in my deep set wrinkles on my fact around my mouth.  I will order these again and again.  I want to see my face in about a year from now to really see a difference.  I am 70 years young so it takes a lot to work on my skin. It takes time for a great work of art!!</li>
    <li> A huge disappointment in this as well.  I just don&#x27;t know why it never does what they say it will do</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s good.. Not really sure if I&#x27;ve seen results.</li>
    <li> I had sever reaction to the serum after a few days of using it.</li>
    <li> As with all Oz Natural products, I am very happy with the results from this. You see, I suffer from severe hyper-pigmentation on my checks area. It almost looks like rosacea, though I have not been officially diagnosed. I also have some broken capillaries around my nose, and other issues like discolored scarring from acne. At the age of 33, I am also starting to get some fine lines around the corners of my mouth, and I have tons of lovely freckles. With all of these things combined, you can now see why I was so quick to try a product that is suppose to help with fine lines and discoloration, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the product works really well. No, my skin is not perfect, and the discolorations are not gone, but I do see an improvement in appearance. Some of the redness has decreased and I notice a big difference in the broken capillaries. It also smooths out my skin, and applying it before my regular facial lotion seems to help is go on more evenly, so my skin is better hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I do love this product. While it is not a &amp;#34;miracle cure&amp;#34; it definitely does help!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I received a product for free for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Read so much about this serum .. I would like to recieve a free sample and give it a try rentinol serum.. I&#x27;m already using OZ c serum .. And going to order soon the second bottle ... !!</li>
    <li> This week I have been using the new OZ Naturals Retinol Serum for Anti Aging and Wrinkles. This serum contains vitamin E and is not tested on animals, which again I feel is very important to note. The product is made in the USA and is FDA approved. This company stands by their product 100%. The thing that separates this from other anti-aging serums I have tried is that it has the ingredient Astaxanthin. This ingredient helps to minimize hyperpigmentation. This serum also is the highest retinol available without a prescription so this stuff is definitely built to provide you with newer and more firm feeling skin with each application. This is a product that you would find in doctors offices and now is available to you to buy without having to go see a Dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this I can say that my face not only felt firmer and smoother but also seemed to add more color to my face. I had a face now that felt and appeared younger. I was concerned at first by its appearance when it came out of the bottle but the minute I applied It to my skin it seemed to disappear and fill in all the aging spots and begin working immediately! I do not have to worry about chemicals that are harmful on my face and I feel smoother and younger skin that is soft now daily. I highly recommend everyone try this product!! This product is a HIT!</li>
    <li> I have been testing all kinds of serums to see which ones work and which ones I like. This product is outstanding. It smells great and goes on smoothly leaving my skin feeling tight and fresh. I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I just received this product the other day and have noticed results immediately. My skiin is a lot smoother, radiant, and I have always had larger pores in my T-zone area and I have noticed that my pores have decreased in size tremendously, making my skin look even more clear and beautiful. I have acne scars on my forehead mainly and very deep, prominent ones between my eyebrows that have I have not been able to reduce for YEARS and I could not believe it, but this has improved those scars. I am amazed considering nothing has in the slightest bit helped those specific scars and now that I have come across something that has, I don&#x27;t believe I will ever buy any other anti aging serum ever again. this is truly the best quality deal I have ever seen, and I am so glad I waited to buy that estee lauder serum I had my eye on because I found THIS!</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love IT!!!</li>
    <li> Very good serum at an affordable price!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> This serum contains retinol, but thankfully it did not dry out my skin, even in the winter. It wore very nicely under my moisturizer and make up application on top was not a problem. Oz Naturals sent it to me for review, and the quality of it is impressive. This has a great pump on it, which dispenses the perfect amount of product with each application... and I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and I still have a ton left, so it&#x27;s a good value for the money.</li>
    <li> This is truly amazing. Even my saggy neck has gotten firmer. No other product has ever done this regardless of the claims. I will continue using this.</li>
    <li> This serum went right in my skin without any sticky residue and had a light fresh non-perfumey scent unlike other serums I&#x27;ve tried on the market.  Within the first few weeks I could see wrinkles around my smile line had visibly diminished &amp; my jaw line appeared tighter. I will definitely be using this product regularly because I can already see amazing results!</li>
    <li> Recently received this new product. I like consistency of the orange gel. I applied over serum and then applied a moisturizer on top. Skin issoft the next morning and a better than it had been in a long time. I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s so finding an affordable product that works well and doesn&#x27;t leave me with dry skin is a plus.  This works better than other retinol products that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Works great with dermal roller</li>
    <li> Oz Naturals are awesome products.  See my review on the Cleanser.  I have used these products for almost a year.  I started with the cleanser, AHA and C serums.  I liked them so well that I expanded my collection to include the Eye Gel, Retinol Moisturizer, and this facial mask.  I am 61 and had a woman today who was complaining about turning 50 this year.  I jokingly told her to wait another 11 years.  She was shocked at my age and thought I was younger than her.  I get that a lot!!  Thank you Oz Naturals!!</li>
    <li> I use this product along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum along with a moisturizer.  As I&#x27;ve stated in that review, these products work well together and I do see a softening of the deeper lines.  It&#x27;s not dramatic but I see a difference and my makeup goes on much smoother.  I will continue to use the product as it&#x27;s still better than others that I&#x27;ve used for three times the price.</li>
    <li> Very helpful in short time period.</li>
    <li> It seems to be working.as described.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my complexion.</li>
    <li> I have to say as I am quickly approaching my 50th birthday, that wrinkles have become a big concern.  I have been trying this now for about a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this is that it is packaged nice enough that I would be happy to give it as a gift.  I washed my face as normal and then applied this serum.  I have been using this at night and after I apply the serum, I use my regular face  Moisturizer after I am all done applying it.  It doesn&#x27;t have an oily feel to it, and has a pleasant smell to it.  I have noticed a big difference in my skin already.  I won&#x27;t tell you that it magically has gotten rid of all the wrinkles that I don&#x27;t want to admit are there, however I can say that I see a difference in my skin in general since using this. The other thing that I will mention , is that my husband is starting to notice a difference, which says a lot by itself.  I am looking forward to the long term results of using this Retinal Serum.</li>
    <li> I have used serum&#x27;s for some time.  I really like this one.  It penetrates quickly and does not leave a stickly feeling on the skin.  You will like this product.  I need to use this product for a period to see if there are results, but my initial commets are very positive...Definately worth a try.  You will be pleased.</li>
    <li> Very happy with many of the Oz products. Currently using the hyaluronic acid serum in the AM  and this Retinol  serum at night,  followed by my favorite Olay moisterizers. Skin feels smoother and glowy. Very impressed with the results...</li>
    <li> I started to use this 2 weeks ago and i wasn&#x27;t sure if it was mind over matter that I was seeing a difference and that I wanted it to be working. I was in work one day and 2 of my colleagues said to me that my skin looked &amp;#34;toned&amp;#34; and one of them is a man ! I hadn&#x27;t mentioned to anyone that I was trying out a new serum so I can only think that yes there is a change ( for the better) I feel that my skin is toned and the pigmentation is more even (I have freckles)all in all very happy and my second order arrived so definitely sticking with this.</li>
    <li> This is like the worst skin product I have  ever used.  I used it for over a week but not even moisturize my skin for a little.  Only feel like I put water on.  I ended up stopped using it goes back to my regular moisturizer.  Dont buy it at all or you will end up wasting your money for a bottle of colored water.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to use any serums or creams on my skin, until now. I love the way it makes my skin feel and if I forget to use it I can tell the difference. No reactions or breakouts and it disappears into your skin without leaving any greasiness or residue. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> watery consistency, which I like because I have oily skin. made me look better immediately.</li>
    <li> After using this product for about a month, I did notice a difference.  I noticed the skin around my jaw line was a little tighter after using it with a derma roller.  I apply this daily, morning and night and do not have any dryness.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
    <li> I really feel like this stuff has helped my face. If you use a good moisturizer (coconut oil for me) your face will not dry out at all</li>
    <li> I love everything in this line of products... Except this. For me, this product broke my skin out , not sure why? But I started using it under my eyes and so far  so good. For me it just isn&#x27;t good all over my face. I do have sensitive skin, but I love their other products!</li>
    <li> This product is okay. Haven&#x27;t yet experience the whole Retinol wrinkle and fine lines minimizer experience yet.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s done anything and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks. I use after derma rolling my face. I guess time will tell. But the serum itself is light, pretty odorless after being applied.</li>
    <li> I just started using it, so I&#x27;m not sure yet. I&#x27;m 72 and I may be beyond help! Years of sun damage and other unhealthy choices. I&#x27;ll keep you posted!</li>
    <li> This brand is ok, but the best Vitamin Serum in amazon with real effect in 2 weeks is Bellafab Serum.</li>
    <li> I like how it feels on my face. Not greasy but moisturized. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, nothing reveraes aging.</li>
    <li> Love this serum. Doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel on your skin.</li>
    <li> all the OZ products are good and this is no different.  It is good under the Retia A cream</li>
    <li> this product was not affective and really turned my eyes red and blurred my vision.  I did not apply it near my eyes.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, it really works!</li>
    <li> Amazing product to try</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product!  It went on very smoothly and absorbed into my skin right away.  It left my face feeling very smooth.  I would highly recommend this Retinol Serum.  Have not been using this serum very long but so far it has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month and my skin looks bright and soft. This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> The queen is using it every morning, and seems to be pleased with the results so far.</li>
    <li> This stuff is perfect! Ive been using it for 2 weeks and i can already see some changes on my face! It looks younger! Really!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30s and thankfully don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet and I&#x27;d like to keep it that way. I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any negative reaction to this and my skin looks brighter, softer. I use this as part of my nighttime Korean skincare routine - after toner/essence but before any moisturizers.</li>
    <li> seems ok but I need to use it more often</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a short time, but I&#x27;m already noticing improvement in my skin acne.</li>
    <li> only a week use and seeing good results</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. You see thf difference almost immediately</li>
    <li> Would never buy again. Used for 3 days that&#x27;s all I could stand it. To Thick and Lays there on your skin like another layer. It&#x27;s Sticky, Really Sticky...Stuck to my pillow and hand Everything that touched my face. Like wearing a mask!! Would Never recommended to Anybody!! My skin is drier in nature and I thought would absorb the Vit E...Not So!! 3 days &amp; it was in the garbage. Never noticed Any signs of helping my problems, wrinkles, age spots, etc...Just noticed that my face was sticking to anything that got next to it, pillow, clothing, another Face! Ahhhhh....Terrible!! Is there a make less than 1??? Hope this helps....</li>
    <li> Love this serum!! I have tried retinol lotion before and was looking for something like this. I know that Retinols are the most proven and effective beauty ingredient for actually impacting the appearance of skin (Thanks Dr. Oz) and couldn&#x27;t wait to try this! The product has an amazing list of ingredients. It&#x27;s orange and slightly thinner then honey. I use 2-3 pumps to cover my face/neck and have noticed a decrease in the darkness of break out spots and the brown patches I developed after my pregnancies. I do have sensitive skin and after 4 days I noticed some irritation...with my sensitive skin 4 days is great!!  The product says it can be used daily, but I plan on using it 3x a week with a skip day in between. It does need to be worn with sunscreen because it makes skin more prone to sunburn. However, I wear it with night cream at home and put on a day cream with sunscreen in the mornings. Serums are delivery methods for powerful ingredients, so it&#x27;s not designed to moisturize, but rather improve skin with it&#x27;s ingredient combo. When the product arrived I did notice that some of the serum seeped out from under the screw-on pump and I have e-mailed the company. Oz Naturals offers a 100% satisfaction guarantee!! I would recommend this to a friend or family member and am so thrilled to have found this magic eraser.  Ingredients include: Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.  Disclosure: I received a free product sample to facilitate my review, however the opinions expressed are my own.xpressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Red marks are fading and skin seems happy. First time in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to submit an honest review and did so.&lt;br /&gt;I do not remember if this was a free product- I purchase many things from Oz Naturals.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was that my face is softer and that the color is more even. I have some redness and freckles and it appeared that they may have been smoothed out after just a couple of uses, nothing drastic but with continued use I can see great changes. It didn&#x27;t really have a scent so it was not overpowering and was pretty thick but seemed to soak into my skin very well. I did not like that the product came in with the safety seal on it but it did not need to be removed to open the product. This is a packaging issue I know but it seems to me that this makes the integrity of the product questionable. I did receive this product as a free sample but the opinions are my own honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I am currently using OZ Natural Hyaluronic acid serum + Vitamin C serum (morning) and their Retinol serum (evening).&lt;br /&gt;After 2 months, the texture of my skin slightly improved: pores have shrunk and the skin is smoother. Not bad but nothing revolutionary. Really.&lt;br /&gt;So, because I am using a combination of 3 OZ Naturals products, it is a bit hard to give a precise feedback on 1 product in particular.&lt;br /&gt;I use Retinol Serum each evening + night cream and I never have been sure of any improvement with this on in particular. Then, I discovered this 2.09 minutes video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;nJE090r7RPM from DermTVdot.com. I made some little searches after and I discovered that retinol is totally useless despite all the advertisements done. The real effectiveness comes from retinoïc acid and Retin A. I didn&#x27;t try RetinA yet but I will and for sure and I&#x27;ll never buy any retinol product anymore from Roc or others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else: One think to know: I&#x27;ve been attracted to buy OZ products because they have a great amount of very good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;Because when you buy something from them, they encourage you to leave a good comment. Then, they will send you free samples!&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to see with the quality of their products that, to me are &amp;#34;so-so&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Good comments &#x3D; free samples... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a fair way to attract people.</li>
    <li> Love this product! OZ Naturals is the best skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I purchased OZ Retinol Serum, Retinol Moisturizer and the Ocean Mineral Cleanser at night, and am pleasantly surprised by how well these three products work together.  I was using an extremely expensive natural brand (3-5x the $ of OZ) and while it worked well, I felt a little sick spending so much on skincare.  I normally don&#x27;t switch dramatically because it upsets my skin, but did not experience any trouble at all!  The only problem I have is that I can&#x27;t determine which product is doing the most for me, but I can say this: the cleanser is gentle and thorough, and I believe the serum in combo with the moisturizer have worked together to lighten up some dark spots that just popped up at 40.  My skin is soft, smooth and feels good, and not oily at all (I have combo skin) .  I&#x27;m going through some serious stress right now too, so I can&#x27;t vouch for my eyes yet... but I&#x27;m expecting good things soon.  I will definitely buy the moisturizer again and hoping the serum is back in stock soon!</li>
    <li> I have been using for a month and no results yet.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this new serum!  The dispenser gives you just the right amount to cover your face.  My skin immediately began to feel firm.  I let it dry then put moisturizer over it.  The moisturizer seems to get absorbed better and together they work to make my complexion look good.  I then follow up with sunscreen and a light foundation.  My face feels firm and hydrated throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I love this serum! I have sensitive skin and dry skin especially in the winter months. With this serum followed by the moisturizer my skin feels revived and refreshed. I feel like my dark spots are beginning to fade and with continued use can only get better. I use this product day and night it has been great for my face and I feel like I am undoing some of the damage I have done.I highly recommend this product and this skin care line!</li>
    <li> After using Retinol&#x27;s from Roc and Neutrogena for years I found out one needs a product with at least 1% Retinol to have any sort of a beneficial effect. I then went on the hunt for something stronger (most over the counter never actually say what the Retinol concentration is) only to find most products contain Dimethicone which I&#x27;m allergic to. I was so happy to finally find a natural Retinol product not only free of Dimethicone but also with a concentration of 2.5%. The first night I used this I knew this was the real deal, every single blemish was gone and by the second day the skin was sloughing off and the inflammation was gone. Any leftover scars were becoming lighter and lighter within a couple of days. In the past this could take months.    The serum itself is a thick gel consistency that immediately liquefies once it&#x27;s smoothed over the skin. One thing I did want to mention is this formulation does contain wild crafted Resina propoli/bee propolis. There seems to be some controversy over this being vegan so I wanted to mention that here. Honey bees collect this and use it as the glue in making their beehives. It&#x27;s said to have the ability to stop infections which is why I&#x27;ve been meaning to try it along with royal jelly for a long time and am glad I finally did with this product. I really believe this along with the other ingredients in this particular formula has been excellerating my skin healing. I do have to skip days as if I use it too many days in a row, my skin can feel tender. Very similar to tretinoin. Typically I use the 2.5% Retinol serum in the evenings and another Oz Naturals product, the Ocean Minerals Glyconic tonic, in the mourning under sunblock/BB cream.    One of the best products in my skincare arsenal and definitely one of the best Retinol products out there. Will order again.    OZ Naturals sent a free sample for review.</li>
    <li> This product really helped even out my skin tone. After using it my skin fly tight and the crow&#x27;s feet around my eyes were less noticeable. The only downside to this product is how dry this makes my skin-with the cold winter here I struggled with keeping my ski. Hydrated with the product. Overall decent product.</li>
    <li> I have to be 53, I don&#x27;t have to look it!! And that&#x27;s just what using this serum is doing!! It has a great pump, that dispenses just the right amount. I really like how it isn&#x27;t runny and I could put it where I wanted without it dripping off my finger before I had it where I wanted.An added bonus is the very light, barely noticeable sent, so it dosent bother my asthma &amp; I can continue to use it, being fair skinned I run into sensitivity issues and I&#x27;m very happy that this serum didn&#x27;t cause me any :) finaly a product that says what it does, &amp; does what is says, wish I had found this product sooner! I will reorder this again. :)</li>
    <li> If I have received both, positive and visible results in my 60’s, then younger women who are not struggling against the age-related degenerating conditions will most likely receive even better and faster results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals has introduced a new product to their skin-care product line, a Retinol Serum. The Oz Natural Retinol Serum is a professional correcting serum, containing 2.5% retinol, astaxanthin, and vitamin E.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol is a form of Vitamin A and its application and uses are for the general improvement for skin’s health, it is an alternative to tretinoin, a product utilized in prescription skin treatments. The benefit of retinol is that it tends to have the same effect, as Retin A or Tretinoin without the negative side effects that are associated with Retin A and Tretinoin such as the burning sensation and the peeling/scaling of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to my age of over 60, the struggle to maintain firm skin texture and elasticity is a challenge due to my age-related collagen depletion, therefore my anti-aging fight has become a war. My previous endeavors include a CO2 treatment to eliminate the sunspots that had accumulated over the years, which was both a painful and expensive experience. I had also gone the route of Retin A for several months, which does help in constant exfoliation, for as long as usage is continued, but there were some drawbacks; skin irritation, and the constant peeling and scaling which I found more embarrassing then having my fine lines visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five weeks ago, I started the Oz Naturals Retinol Serum; my results are firmer skin texture, healthier skin tone, and tiny finer lines below my eyes and on my cheeks are no longer noticeable, unless scrutinized in my 8 X magnifying mirror. I have noticed progress on both my forehead and around my lips. I am unable to report on any beige/brown sunspots due to my aforementioned CO2 treatment. However, skin cells take a month to turn over and within the five weeks that I have used Oz Natural a new healthier layer of skin has surfaced. The positive results have been gradual, they are also visible, an acquaintance in my age bracket has asked if I have lately had ‘a little work done, ‘around my eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals 2.5% Retinol Serum comes in dark brown bottle with an air-less pump dispenser, a safeguard against bacterial contamination. The serum is a light pinkish/orange but upon application, it is colorless on the skin. Two small pump amounts cover both my face and neck, it is not greasy, it is not oily, it is not sticky, and there is no smell. It absorbs immediately leaving skin, soft, smooth, and supple. I have not experienced any irritation that I had formerly associated with Retin A, and the Tretinoin, and my greatest satisfaction is that I have NOT suffered through any embarrassing peeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Major Benefits of Oz Retinol Serum:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) CLEARS ACNE – topical retinol effectively treats acne by unblocking skin follicles and exfoliating skin cells to keep pores clear, it helps to eliminate the bacteria responsible for causing blemishes and pimples. Therefore, retinol effectively works as an acne-destroying agent and the retinol continues to keep skin clear of blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) SHRINKS SKIN PORES – although pore size determination is through genetics, retinol can help improve skin pore&#x27;s shape and size, due to exfoliating achievement of removing the debris that widens and distends skin pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) LIGHTENING AND BRIGHTENING SKIN BY FADING BROWN SUNSPOTS AND OTHER SKIN MARKS – retinol works as a powerful anti-oxidant, effectively helping to repair skin damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) DIMINISHES LINES AND WRINKLES – retinol has power to help rejuvenate skin; it is effective in smoothing out the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals has added Astaxanthin as an ingredient to their retinol serum, and below is a short explanation of the incredible beneficial accomplishments that Astaxanthin has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is NO toxicity to Astaxanthin, it is a natural and organic substance derived from algae and fish such as wild salmon. Research states astaxanthin is the most potent antioxidant nature has to offer. Regarding the antioxidant power and potency, astaxanthin is 550 times stronger than vitamin E, and 6,000 times stronger than vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astaxanthin is distinctively unique because it does NOT block UV rays, therefore it does not prevent UVB from converting into Vitamin D in your skin, although it does PROTECT skin against damage. The UV radiation produces free radicals (a skin damaging factor), however astaxanthin is a potent antioxidant that neutralizes and extinguishes those free radicals and stops them from causing the damaging effects of both sunburn and inflammation of the skin. An additional benefit is that Vitamin C, E and others can only handle one free radical at a time, whereas according to research studies, Astaxanthin has the capacity to control over 19 different free radicals simultaneously, absorbing, and neutralizing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astaxanthin is different from other antioxidants. It remains active far longer than other antioxidants, and when other antioxidants deplete astaxanthin remains intact, as there are no chemical reactions to break it down, a common failing that occurs in other antioxidants. Another unique aspect is astaxanthin can expand cellular membranes and provide antioxidant protection right in the cellular membrane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are unsure regarding the order of application of skin-care products, I have provided a general sequence:&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> The product did make my skin smoother,however, I am 69 years old and my wrinkles must be too far gone for this product to be effective</li>
    <li> Have ordered several times!</li>
    <li> Everyone comments about my skin...NO wrinkles!</li>
    <li> As Amazon uk had run out of this new serum very quickly I looked on here and was so happy to be able to order this serum and have it shipped to scotland and my goodness im so pleased in my late 50s iv dicovered oz naturals by word of mouth and have to say they are amazing and dont break the bank i thought next day that was silly you know this along with all other oz products i have bought will be great and paid and ordered another to be shipped Im so glad i did as its really along with oz toner moisturiser and eye gel plus vit c serum oz too is really making a noticable differance to my skin so much so people are noticing and family and friends ordering for themselves so Go Oz as these products do what they claim for my aging skin it feels better than it has for such a long time it was such a fast delivery too came 5days earlier than they estimated I was over the moon</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an expert in cosmetology but when I go to see one they always tell me I have beautiful skin. I&#x27;m using the product to support the anti-aging process and in my opinion it works</li>
    <li> This product gave me the results I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Retinol Serum for a few weeks now. It is not irritating, and two small pumps cover my entire face. I am using it along with the Vitamin C serum, morning and night.  My face is brighter, and it may also be helping some of the fine lines.  I don&#x27;t see any changes in the deeper wrinkles on the forehead.</li>
    <li> Loved it, face feels tighter after about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> I’ve been experimenting with different types of Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid Serums to try to find out which one I like best. Dr Oz has raved about the anti-aging benefits of of Vitamin C and E on the skin and these Serums have become all the rage. I received a 1oz bottle of OZ Naturals Retinol 2.5% Serum + Astaxanthin + Vitamin E to review. As I have mentioned before while reviewing other anti-aging products, I am not one to jump on the anti-ageing hype but I do want to take care of my skin the best that I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: (71% Organic) Organic Aloe Barbadensis (Aloe Vera), Isopropyl Palmitate (Palm Oil), Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Organic Carthamus Tinctorius (Safflower Oil), Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond Oil), Hyaluronic Acid, Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba Oil), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), Organic Resina Propoli (Propolis), Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea Butter), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl Glycerin, Xanthan Gum, Allantoin, Citric Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: After cleansing, exfoliating, toning, and serum application, apply moisturizer generously to the skin; allow to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum has a consistency of a thick aloe and is a orangish color, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin (does not discolor skin) and is also Orderless. The product is in dark brown bottle with an air-less pump dispenser, a safeguard against bacterial contamination. This is the second product from Oz Naturals that I have tried and I&#x27;m Hooked!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these products!!</li>
    <li> never buy  or order.... its a scam!!!!</li>
    <li> For get it. Look for another brand!!!&lt;br /&gt;Deborah</li>
    <li> This product is a bit pricey for half a bottle content. I ordered this item to my friend&#x27;s house. When I received it, it was still in double sealed, an adhesive wrapped around the bottle neck and another sticker to hold the cap and the bottle together but the content is already half of the bottle. It is no way that my friend has opened it as the sealed was still in tact. The liquid is thick, I am not sure whether it is originally thick as this is my first time ordering the product or it becomes thick because some of the liquid has vapor out. I saw some dry residue around the neck on the paper box. I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet. I ordered other OZ Naturals products and had received it in good shape.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find any benefit from this product.</li>
    <li> Mhh! Not certain is this really does anything, but if you wish hard enough, maybe it does.</li>
    <li> I do not have bad wrinkles at 73, but I love this Retinol product.  I look younger in a few days. Will continue to use this product.  This was the first time, but it will surely not be my last order of OZ Naturals. I use it twice a day, and like how easily it goes on. I use nothing with it, unless I go out for the evening, a little blush.</li>
    <li> love how soft my skin is and already seeing big difference in quality :)</li>
    <li> Noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I have seen no difference.  I would not buy this again!</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed in this product. It dried my skin out &amp; made me look even older. I stayed with it for 2 weeks before I thew it away.</li>
    <li> I like this product. My skin is sensitive, but this product is light and gentle to the skin. It has made a slight difference in my facial appearance.</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received my order, however, when I opened the box approximately 1/8th of the serum leaked out of the bottle.  The reason for the 3 stars is that I took some of the leaked serum and rubbed it on my face.  It made my face feel soft so I may reorder.</li>
    <li> I liked it, feel it was effective and would buy again.</li>
    <li> No results and used as directed</li>
    <li> Arrived  time....great product!</li>
    <li> Got tired of the routine. My face got irritated. Had to be real careful not to let it get close to my eyes. To be fair I didn&#x27;t give it a really good shot and didn&#x27;t stick with it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> Give it time. Anything you buy to change something in your life, just give it some time to explain itself. At least a month. What&#x27;s all this &amp;#34;give me a miracle now, or...&amp;#34; mentality? And what&#x27;s all this &amp;#34;it worked over night&amp;#34; confessions?  ( it&#x27;s all psychological.) I had to use this for a month first to see some real changes. The second bottle was thicker but same color. I like it, I have no complains. Make your skin happy with simple steps. Vitamin C + Rosehip Seed Oil + Fish Oil Capsules + Plenty of Water + Sleep &#x3D; great skin.</li>
    <li> not too much of an improvement but keep hoping</li>
    <li> Oz products are all so good I used a high end skin care product for years. Paying hundreds of dollars for serums that are nowhere as good as this. I use it twice a day on clean skin and I see a dramatic difference in tone and color. My skin is soft and smooth . I can not say enough about this product or any of the other Oz products i have tried. this was sent to me free in return for an honest opinion. I am very grateful to Oz Naturals for the opportunity to do so. I don&#x27;t think I would have changed my regular products had this not been offered to me.</li>
    <li> this just feels like water, doesn&#x27;t do anything, don&#x27;t waste your money; the vitamin C serum is better</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and noticed the next day how soft my skin felt.  I will continue to let you know all the changes that take place?  So far I love how my skin feels.</li>
    <li> This product was too harsh for my face so I am not using it.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell that it does anything-- just  putting another gel on my face. I think it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Blends in well and does not show any appearance it is there. but after several days helped skin tone and overall consistency of skin color</li>
    <li> This is a good serum but it tends to leave sort of oily residue when I wake from sleeping in it. Makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> This product really works! I&#x27;ve tried a few retinol products, and so far this is the one I like the most. The price for this product is very affordable and it is the only product in the market that contains 2.5% retinol. For those who are new to the retinol, it is a form of Vitamin A which help improve skin structure. This anti-aging serum can reduce fine lines and deep wrinkles. I have noticed smoother and more radiant skin after 2 weeks of using it every night before I go to bed.  One thing you have to keep in mind is that since it increases the turnover rate at a cellular level, you should always apply sunblock with 30+ SPF when you are using any retinol product. It is important to remember that your skin is more sensitive as the retinol serum sweeps away dead skin cells, sunblock will help guard your skin from any heat exposure when you are out and about.</li>
    <li> The market is filled with ant-aging products and even though we have many too choose from, some rarely work. Like I have mentioned in past reviews, no oversight like in the supplement world, so most products just have to not hurt you and they are really overlooked and still being sold. I spent the last few weeks testing out serums to devices that help with aging skin. It&#x27;s so hard knowing I invested a few weeks and a product just did not deliver what was stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, Oz Naturals was not one of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love retinol and especially one that did not cost an office visit. Yes, the prescriptions are not as costly as one would think but the office visits cost money and refills require another office visit. It gets up there and I honestly do not feel I am need of the prescription strength, yet. I prefer to not over medicate my face because if I up the potency, I also up the side effects and with Summer around, I also up my chances of getting a red and peely face. I&#x27;m all for anti-aging but shedding skin like a lizard is not sexy no matter the bikini you wear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oz Naturals has a 2.5% retinol serum, which contains Astaxanthin and Vitamin E. The formula is a strong orange hue in color that always makes me think the retinol oxidized, as yellow is the first tinge you see when it does, followed by the orange color that comes after. Thankfully, this is just a coloring from the ingredients versus a serum going wonky and I prefer getting pass the color versus a dye being added to just calm my fears. That is what Oz Naturals does, it offers a natural approach to your skincare&#x27;s needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as listed on website): Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf (Aloe), Cassia Angustifolia Seed Polysaccharide (botanical hyaluronic acid), HamamelisVirginiana (Witch Hazel), Pentylene Glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, Polysorbate 20, Potassium Phosphate, Hydroxyethyl Cellulose, Carrageenan Gum, Organic SimmondsiaChinensis (Jojoba Oil), TriticumVulgare (Wheat Germ Oil), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Organic Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea), WildcraftedResinaPropoli (Propolis), Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astaxanthin: This was an ingredient that I had heard of but was not familiar with, as not any of my beauty products contain it. It&#x27;s a carotenoid and an antioxidant. It&#x27;s what they feed salmon when people for some reason want to see a pinker/orange hue in their fish. It does not convert to retionol (Vitamin A), however research which is still limited, has reflected it may aid with inflammation, oxidation and even UV damage. I like that it&#x27;s simple and as long as it&#x27;s derived naturally and not in it&#x27;s synthetic form, it has the potential to help and protect against oxidative (free-radical) aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I love serums because my skin loves them. They absorb quickly and that means less residue and you don&#x27;t feel that heaviness that some creams tend to leave behind. Most serums play well with cosmetics and because I have increased my retinol use to both day and night use, just making sure I use sunscreen in the day to avoid redness or hyper-pigmentation issues. The latter part would kind of go against what I am trying to do (save my skin), so please don&#x27;t skip on your SPF. I used the serum for a total of 3 weeks and like always, I am going from one 2.5% retinol brand to another. I will notice if a product works if it does or does not maintain the progress I have previously achieved, and I can then measure if the new serum brings anything new to the party. Even though Oz Naturals is orange in color, it did not leave a orange colored goop that was hard to hide. My skin absorbed the serum with no problems! I did notice that my skin at week two had a nicer and more pleasant texture. My skin had a glow that the previous retinol serum did not add. It was not an oily glow but just a healthy one and because I suffer from horrible seasonalallergies, this is something that unfortunately always reflects on my face and sadly my skin. The glow I got sort of helped make me look healthier and less tired, so it took attention away from the signs of having bad allergies gives you. I&#x27;ll take it! Any serum that can do more than just deliver retinol is what I seek. I&#x27;m always looking to simplify my routine and I literally went from Oz Naturals 2.5% retinol serum to then moisturizer at night, and done! Just switch to an SPF moisturizer in the day and it&#x27;s the easiest and most effective duo I have found, so no excuses that you have no time for your skin. With Oz Naturals, you will only need 3 minutes to get what I consider a good anti-aging beauty regimen, so you can even do it while brushing your teeth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Oz Naturals.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.

    <li> haven&#x27;t seen the changes, guess it is slow improvement.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product when it was offered for free. In return I&#x27;m sharing my findings. I have now been using the product for several weeks. I wanted a retinol serum product for firming benefits. This product has met that criteria on the face and neck area. I also experimented on the upper back legs, cellulite. The experiment has not shown either positive nor negitive results. Non were promised. In all areas of use the skin is soft and has a fresh organic peach texture. The serum is quick drying and a little, 2 pumps for face and neck, goes a long way. It will probably last a few couple, maybe few, months with twice daily use. The ingredients are natural with no strong or displeasing odor. Directions and ingredients are listed by the manufacturer. I found the product to be truthfully represented by the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin smooth I love the feeling this serum can bring to my skin the softness it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> Pleasantly surprised by the results. This formula works nicely into the skin with zero irritation and noticeable minimization of fine lines.</li>
    <li> This serum is AMAZING. Took away the fine lines around my eyes. No sticky, heavy feeling. Within days my skin looked softer and was even smoother to the touch! I even got compliments on how beautiful my skin looked! &amp;#34;Flawless&amp;#34; was the word they used! Definetly worth the money!</li>
    <li> I have not seen a vast improvement but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks. But what I see so far is encouraging. Will buy again</li>
    <li> This gel comes out well from the pump bottle, spreads well and easily.  A small amount goes a long way. Great to use with any other facial product or moisturizer if you want the benefits of retinol.  I appreciate this product.</li>
    <li> This works so well. The cost is so much better than buying big brand names plus no nasty ingredients. I&#x27;m now a fan. Will buy other oz products in the future. Will be more effective and save me a ton of money! Thanks oz!</li>
    <li> My skin is brighter and softer since using this product</li>
    <li> Excellent serum. I use prior to using retinol cream and other moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This is a fairly good product, it does feel good on the skin and does seem to give some slight benefit in skin texture, however I did not notice any reduction of fine lines or wrinkles for me personally.</li>
    <li> Retinol serums are a key to keeping nice and healthy skin and protecting it from wrinkles! I don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles yet but I use this as a preventative measure so that I can keep my skin looking healthy and wrinkle free. I also love the texture of the product and the way it feels on my skin. There is no sticky residue or strange smell. It feels amazing and OZ Naturals uses natural ingredients which makes me feel even better considering all the parabens other companies use these days. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product or company! They are amazing</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;ve been using almost a month. It goes on smoothly. Not sticky or harsh. I have very sensitive, combo, acneic skin. So I have to be extremely careful what I use. I like the fact that this is all natural since my skin does better with natural products. A little goes a long way. I notice my face looks more even. This is my first time trying a serum and I am very pleased. I look forward to trying the rest of the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW their customer service is wonderful. They get back to you very quickly.</li>
    <li> I received my OZ naturals retinol serum in the mail yesterday. I am so excited because it is yet another fantastic product to add to my skin care regime! Just like all my other OZ Naturals products and I am very pleased with this one! I tested it on my skin right away and it felt great. It came out of the bottle with the texture of a gel and glided on my skin so easy and smooth. It went on my skin clear and felt light. It made my skin feel fresh and very smooth and silky soft. It even has a very pleasant smell. I only need a tiny amount to cover my whole face, so I feel like the bottle will last me a very long time. I have very sensitive skin and OZ naturals is the only skin care line I have found that works so amazingly for me and does not cause me to react. I love that OZ naturals is 100% vegan and has ingredients in their products that are organic and natural. I would recommend this product as well as all others from OZ Naturals! Great company and products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was made available for free for review purposes.</li>
    <li> Used up one entire bottle of this (nightly use over 5 months) &amp; I&#x27;m sad to say all the hype and good reviews were totally unjustified.  Didn&#x27;t see any noticeable results.  Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using the retinal serum for a little over a week.  Very gentle on skin no redness or excessive dryness.  I have been using it once a day followed by the retinal moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love that its high on vitamin C and that it is for fading dark spots. I do see my dark spots fading.</li>
    <li> This retinol serum has made a great difference in the color of my skin. The dark spots are fading, the skin looks great.After a  few days of use I was amazed when I washed my face and notice the color of my skin more uniform and the expression lines less noticeable.</li>
    <li> I received Oz Naturals  skin care about five days ago and I must tell you I am very pleased. I use it in the morning and at night following the directions as stated for use. I can feel firmness to my skin after I apply it, giving me that firm texture you want to feel for aging skin. I expect to see even more results after extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Barbara</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum! My wrinkles seem to be disappearing! I love their entire line of facial products! I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> It looks like it&#x27;s making a difference already</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use a Retinol product at night. I tried something the derm recommended, it was fine but it was pricey. This one had great reviews and it was the right price. My skin looks smooth and the uneven pigmentation seems to look better. I will order again!</li>
    <li> The serum is sticky and difficult to wash off, even with Oz&#x27;s fine Vitamin C cleanser.  Many scrubs are necessary.</li>
    <li> Wow, It is just fantastic. Believe all the reviews you read regarding this product. It is gentle and works like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product by reading the reviews and and I am so glad I did...</li>
    <li> because years ago i did not know the damage the sun could cause your skin and i worshipped the sun from my teens thru my late thirties... i have an olive complexion so i didn&#x27;t get the wrinkles of some of more fair skinned friends...i used this product around my eyes and on my chest near my cleavage and within the first week of use i found my skin to be more firm and smooth looking...my crows feet(which aren&#x27;t THAT bad), looked less noticeable..honestly...give it a try and see for yourself..</li>
    <li> So far this is good.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell long range effect.</li>
    <li> This product has given Amazing Results!!! It leaves my skin skin feeling smooth and younger looking. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I love it!!</li>
    <li> Well, I could write litanies about this product, tell you how wonderful it is, but I would just be saying what all of the others already said - so let me just say: THIS IS ONE AhhhhhhMAZING serum!!! I absolutely LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;It is NOT my first OZ Naturals product, and they are yet to make me unhappy!!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Way to go, OZ Naturals!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you know what else?????&lt;br /&gt;Is is CRUELTY-FREE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It deserves 10 stars!!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~a humble customer in Italy~</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about a week, so far so good. Skin seems brighter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a month now. While it may contribute to reducing wrinkles, it also contributes to my getting more blemishes.  Albeit, they are small blemishes, I don&#x27;t get them when I stop using this product, and they begin again upon restarting the serum.  Perhaps my skin is just too sensitive, and it may work wonderfully for others. It&#x27;s just not the right product for me.</li>
    <li> Did not see any changes in skin appearance nor in fine line or wrinkle disappearance.  I used it as the directions instructed.</li>
    <li> WOW!! I just try one drop and applied on my forehead, in that moment I can see immediately the wrinkle disappear. Mean this serum quite really strong, but I love it.</li>
    <li> Since using this multiple people have told me that my skin looks dramatically different. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s but started to notice fine lines on my forehead... probably from all of the tanning from living in Florida while I was in college finally catching up with me! I&#x27;ve noticed that not only are the lines on my forehead less noticeable but my face has cleared up and my skin overall just looks more healthier and bright. This is probably the first time in a LONG time that I&#x27;ve felt comfortable walking out of the house without any type of foundation or makeup on. I love the results that I&#x27;ve gotten and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month. Definitely using this from now on.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect complement to OZ moisturizers. I tend to use the serum morning and night, followed in the morning by Super Youth 2.5% retinol moisturizer and at night by Sea Infused moisturizer. After a few weeks my complexion is much more smooth. I am not always faithful with my skincare routine (especially when not wearing make up) but this has helped me to be more consistent.  I did receive this product to try for free but had already purchased and been using the OZ Super Youth moisturizer and would have written the same review had I purchased this product.</li>
    <li> MAKES YOUR SKIN FEEL AMAZING AFTER A COUPLE OF DAYS.  VISIBLY SAW A REDUCTION IN SMALL LINES/WRINKLES.</li>
    <li> Great stuff when it&#x27;s actually in stock. I&#x27;ve been using another brand sold on Amazon and it&#x27;s not quite as good (maybe 4.5 stars) but it&#x27;s always in stock.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with the Hyaluronic Acid serum for the last couple of weeks.  I can&#x27;t tell a difference after adding this serum to my daily routine.  Absords well. Makes my skin feel good.  Will keep using it to avoid wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I just started using this brand.  So far, I like it</li>
    <li> I must have waited too long for this product to work on me</li>
    <li> Just started using this about s month ago and have seen a noticeable decrease in wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this product!! Will be a return customer as also way to go OZ!!!</li>
    <li> love it, feel great on my skin</li>
    <li> Magnific,spectacular,miraculous.</li>
    <li> Works well on my neck.</li>
    <li> OMG! This stuff really works. LOVE IT!! I had been using a prescription product that my dermatologist prescribed, it worked great for years, but as I got older, my skin was becoming dry and flaky. Decided to try this instead, works great, my skin is no longer dry and flaky, and I&#x27;m getting the same wrinkle fighting results as the scripted product. Very happy with it, would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> harsh on my skin though i have normal not sensetive skin . i use it not on a daily basis</li>
    <li> very good product for winter! i will buy again and again.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt better and my complexion seems clearer since using this for a few weeks.  I highly recommend this serum from their line.</li>
    <li> This serum goes on easily and absorbs quickly. My skin felt great and it did not cause any irritation.</li>
    <li> I think it works great.</li>
    <li> Finally a retinol serum! I&#x27;ve been looking for a retinol serum. This is a light weight serum and easily absorbs into your skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and so far I like the results. My skin feels smooth, less oily, less breakouts, and a brighter skin tone. Nice job oz naturals!</li>
    <li> I am loving these Oz products.  This my 4th one.  The serums are the best.  This one is right up there as one of the best.  I like it has clinical strength retinol and Vit. E.  I have been using for about 2 weeks with great results so far.  My face is looking better everyday. My face has a more youthful glow.  I did receive this product complimentary  to give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I love the way this serum glides across my skin with its silky consistency! A little goes a long way! It absorbs instantly, leaving no residue, making it an excellent base for layering any of the Oz Naturals moisturizers. In the morning I layer it with the Sea Infused Moisturizer. At night I layer it with the Super Youth Retinol Moisturizer. The health and appearance of my skin has greatly improved since I began using Oz Naturals products. I&#x27;m so looking forward to even healthier skin with the Retinol Serum! I Highly Recommend!</li>
    <li> So happy to finally have a product that will even out my hyper pigmented skin!&lt;br /&gt;Silky, smooth, and absorbs into the skin without leaving a film or layer. Yay thank&lt;br /&gt;you OZ naturals!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Their whole product line is amazing and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else on my skin!</li>
    <li> I love the OZ Retinol Serum and am ready to get another bottle.  This product is helping me undo the fine lines and wrinkles that the years of only washing my face has done.  A little of this product goes a long way!  I highly recommend this product!  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!  I received this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Seems to be reducing a few of my wrinkles. I&#x27;ll keep using it and report my progress.</li>
    <li> Like the feel of this on my skin, to early to see  if it is working but gives me a sence of hope.</li>
    <li> The reviews are the reason I purchased it but I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in my wrinkles:(  I like how it makes my skin look brighter though, great price, fast shipping and exactly as described, are the reason I will buy from seller again:)</li>
    <li> I have been using Oz Retinol Serum for 9 months and only see a slight improvement in my skin. I will be trying some thing else. The price was 22.00 but they raised it over 35.00 which isn&#x27;t worth the price increase.</li>
    <li> Not sure yet.  I might give it 1 more try after this one runs out.  The one I received was leaking so I am wondering if it was compromised and maybe does not work like it should.</li>
    <li> Good product overall.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. After seeing me my daughter ordered some too.  Then her friends followed</li>
    <li> I received this as a review product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted for this product because I use retinol products, when I remember!  Of all the beauty products, it seems that retinol truly works to smooth the skin and even skin pigmentation. But it can take a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used pharmaceutical-grade retinol, which came in a tube and in a someone greasy base. I had to wait quite a while for it to dry so I could add moisturizer without rubbing off the retinol.  While I might not have chosen this squirt bottle delivery of this non-greasy potion, I&#x27;ve seen how it does become absorbed more quickly.</li>
    <li> The most incredible Serum THERE IS! Have tried everything and you will NOT be disappointed with this incredible product. As a 49 year old - I admit to 34 - I have literally tried EVERYTHING. Have been a devoted Le Mer client for years ... This was suggested to me by my yoga instructor who I thought was about 10 - 12 years younger than me. No. She&#x27;s 53. I bought the whole line that day. I literally have nightmares about running out of this Serum - so I bought two extra bottles. If OZ Naturals ever stops making this there will be anarchy among women my age - and younger - my 21 year old swears by this too and I am so happy she is taking care of her skin - never too young!</li>
    <li> Wow what a difference. .had some sun damage ..only 41..works miracles</li>
    <li> I have been seriously impressed with all of the serums and moisturizers from this line, but I have to say the retinal serum and the retinal moisturizer that goes with it have given me the strongest results. As a 36-year-old mother of a toddler, I&#x27;ve definitely seen some additional fine lines cropping up in the last year. My skin also just seems to feel a little more dull. I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a week, but I have already noticed a dramatic difference in the fine lines around my mouth and at the corners of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the retinol moisturizer from this line for about six weeks though, and I think that is part of why I am seeing faster results by adding the serum into the combination. What I do is cleanse, use a toner to open my pores and get me ready for a serum, apply the serum, brush my hair while I wait for it to dry, and then add moisturizer. I repeat the process in the morning and evening, using a night cream and an eye cream at bedtime, and I can tell I am seeing great results because I actually forgot and stopped doing anything besides cleansing and moisturizing for about a week and half around the holidays, and I looked much more tired. As soon as I picked up my routine again, and added this retinal serum for additional boost, the results came back and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will caution that I have read that ladies who are pregnant or trying to become so should not use retinal treatments during that particular time because the vitamin A does sink into your skin and is absorbed into your system, and the book I read about fertility and becoming pregnant said that because you don&#x27;t know how much of the vitamin A has sunk into your skin, it&#x27;s hard to regulate the exact quantity of this nutrient, and during a delicate time such as pregnancy, you need to be a little bit more regimented. However, I began using the retinol moisturizer after I finished nursing, and since pregnancy and nursing does really take a lot of nutrients from you and I was seeing the negative result of that on my skin, I would highly recommend the product for getting back to yourself after pregnancy, childbirth and nursing.from you and I was seeing the negative result of that on my skin, I would highly recommend the product for getting back to yourself after pregnancy, childbirth and nursing.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any drastic results.</li>
    <li> I was asked to use and review this product.  I am happy to say, it showed results the first day.  I really am thrilled with how my skin looks and feels.  I have paid $250 for a month&#x27;s worth of facial products and yet I see more results in a short time than in a month of using the other.  I am looking forward to seeing how much more it will do in the next month.    Since writing this review, I have had time to really see how well I like it.  I LOVE it.  I would buy this product for sure.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! After using for a month,  my pores are visibly smaller!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works really well. Best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Spilled all over box and was half empty when I got it. I returned it</li>
    <li> not effective at all.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the quality and after a few days of using it my skin feels great and has a natural glow. Will continue to purchase products from OZ Naturals</li>
    <li> Terrible !  Packaging ,  once  I  open the box, more than 40% of the serum already  spilled  out from the bottle . .. so disappointed . ..</li>
    <li> Awesome love it I see some results and it&#x27;s only been a couple of days try this serum&lt;br /&gt;You ll love it !</li>
    <li> The Retinol Serum really does reduce the appearance of aging and makes my skin glow.  This serum starts as a gel and then quickly turns into a liquid which is really nice and cooling on the skin and soaks in nicely.  As with all O The Oz Naturals products makes me look younger, fresher, and evens out my skin tones. The products are natural, animal cruelty free and 100% vegan. The products soak in nicely and I don&#x27;t worry about chemicals, all these products are natural and or organic ingredients. I care what goes on my skin with all the toxins out there it is really nice to not worry about what goes on my face. I highly recommend all of the Oz Natural products.</li>
    <li> It absorbs nicely, not greasy or smelly - noticed a difference immediately!</li>
    <li> This is a great serum.  It firms my skin. I am 62 yrs old. Had a compliment on my how good my skin looked.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t.Have Much Of A Smell Which I Like. make skin Very Soft. But I Didn&#x27;t Like The Fact That The Plastic Seal On The Item Was There For No Reason. I Didn&#x27;t Have To Take The Plastic OfF For It To Pump Out. Which Means It Want Protected</li>
    <li> I just started using this product.  I have been looking for a good, strong over the counter retinol product.  This does the trick!</li>
    <li> i love how it made my skin have a nice glow</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was that my face is softer and that the color is more even. I have some redness and freckles and it appeared that they may have been smoothed out after just a couple of uses, nothing drastic but with continued use I can see great changes. It didn&#x27;t really have a scent so it was not overpowering and was pretty thick but seemed to soak into my skin very well. I did not like that the product came in with the safety seal on it but it did not need to be removed to open the product. This is a packaging issue I know but it seems to me that this makes the integrity of the product questionable. I did receive this product as a free sample but the opinions are my own honest opinion.</li>
    <li> It arrived 1/3 empty with a broken seal. Since I don&#x27;t want to roll the dice on whether it&#x27;s adulterated, I have not used it. Big waste of money!</li>
    <li> my skin appears more even and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will order it again.&lt;br /&gt;Arkansas</li>
    <li> Very high quality, super product! My skin looks youthful and rested after only 4 days!</li>
    <li> Absolutely great product. It works!</li>
    <li> This is a really great serum. I&#x27;ve tried many of these and this would be in my top 3</li>
    <li> I love this company and I have quite a few of there products! This serum is so good!! It comes in an amber glass bottle with a squirt top making it really easy for the serum to come out! The serum is an orangey shade and the consisitancy comes out almost like a gel (a little thinner). There really isn&#x27;t much of a smell at all which is kind of nice! And when it goes on my face it just glides on and instantly melts into my pores! Doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy or dry! I love this! And an added bonus is they don&#x27;t test on animals and it&#x27;s made in America! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true...knowing valuable information can only enrich your knowledge base.  So, know this:  I&#x27;ve said this before &amp; I&#x27;ll say it again, &#x27;Why didn&#x27;t I know about OZ Naturals sooner!?&#x27;  OZ Naturals is liquid gold!!  Here&#x27;s what we both do at night:  cleanse our faces, put on OZ Naturals Vitamin C serum &amp; let it dry, then we put on our new OZ Naturals Retinol Serum and let it dry.  My wife moisturizes afterwards. I don&#x27;t.  We have been using this product for a few days now.  There is no redness or burning.  But more importantly, we both see visible results. Our skin is tighter, &amp; pore size is diminished (especially on my wife&#x27;s face as she has always had larger than normal pores).  I bought my wife a retinol product about a year ago that cost over $60!  She used it once. It turned her sensitive skin red.  I eventually used it up myself. It did a decent job, but not as good as OZ Naturals Retinol serum.  So what have we learned from all this???  1. Great skin care products DO exist &amp; DO deliver the results.  2. You don&#x27;t have to mortgage your home to purchase awesomely performing skin care products.  AND...3. We have learned that inexpensive, AWESOMELY performing products have a name--OZ Naturals.  So...I guess this means there really IS a wizard of Oz:)</li>
    <li> So this is a new &amp;#34;technique&amp;#34; I suppose you would call it, that I stumbled upon from a friend of mine. A retinol serum has a couple of main functionalities. 1) It obviously helps fight the signs of aging, but 2) - and for me more importantly, it actually acts as an &amp;#34;amplifier&amp;#34; for other topical ingredients you put on your skin. Basically it makes other stuff work better, like a moisturizer or a toner. So why is Oz Naturals so good? Basically because it works. The serum absorbs super-quickly, your face feels energized and ready to receive ingredients you are going to put on next, and you can actually feel the next layer working better. My analogy is kind of like, sure, you could fly in a jumbo 474 to get from LA to New York but why not fly in a G6? It just gets you places faster. Im super impressed by Oz Naturals, and I think I can speak for a lot of people when I saw the faster a product gets me to the results I am after, the better.</li>
    <li> I have really been crazy out the OZ products and I have been happy to get rid of any vestiges of other products.  Out with the Clinique, even out with the blue bottles, it must all go.  Now here is another product that is better than any of the Clinique products I depended on and at a fraction of the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a retinol serum.  I use it on my clean skin before I put moisturizer on in the morning and at night.  .  I think that it multiplies the effect of a moisturizer by making it easier to absorb.  After six weeks of using this, my skin has a better texture and feels softer.  I don&#x27;t see the finer lines on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been careful to use quality products on my face for the past thirty years and this is one of the best lines of products.  These are products that are the same quality, but at a much lower price.  It&#x27;s just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review.</li>
    <li> I just started using the oz naturals in conjunction with another skin care products. I have not used solely and just started using. I do like that the company uses natural ingredients &amp; do not test on animals. I&#x27;ll have to use it solely and for a longer time to give it a viable review.</li>
    <li> provides skin with glow and seems to help overall appearance- does not help wrinkles...at all</li>
    <li> I am so impressed with this product , I will continue to purchase as long as available.</li>
    <li> I am new to the Oz Naturals line and I can&#x27;t say enough great things. I have several (3) serums and a moisturizer and love them all. Can&#x27;t wait to check out their other products.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for more from this product after all the rave reviews.  I have noticed that many reviews were made by people who got free samples, so not sure if that was part of the problem?  I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> Skin is smooth with decreased small lines and used with the  Oz vitamin C it hydrated my skin with a bright glow. I like the gel texture which made it easy to apply and no burning sensation.&amp;#34; Meet all my expectation&amp;#34;. Sandra Morgan</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for two weeks and I feel like my overall complexion has brightened. I think with time and consistency of use I will see a real difference in the appearance of the fine lines I have here and there.  So I will continue to use this serum and hope for the best.</li>
    <li> THANK YOU OZ NATURALS!!! This Retinol Serum is the best!!! Oh my goodness, the results are instant and the effects are timeless, meaning my true age is now in question.  I LOVE IT!!! My skin soaks in this serum after I use the Ocean Minerals Toner and leaves it firm and glowing!  I like the bottle which gives you the exact amount needed for all the results you want! And this serum delivers!!! My face is smooth, my skin tone has evened out (goodbye blotchy red skin for no apparent reason), goodbye acne remnants and future mountains too! My pores are smaller and my skin glows!! It is super light and not greasy and is perfect for daytime!!!  I feel like I found the fountain of youth and this is it!!! Thank you OZ Naturals for making wonderful products that truly everyone, including us super sensitive skin girls, can use with confidence!! Amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I have yet to try a product from OZ Naturals that wasn&#x27;t everything they say.  Huge fan of this product line!</li>
    <li> So far so good.. I&#x27;ve been using this with the vitamin c serum for 2 weeks :)</li>
    <li> Received in mail with 3/4 or more gone in the bottle??? Will contact Oz Naturals to see if this can be rectified.</li>
    <li> Great product, amazing price point.  I&#x27;ve paid 5x for the same ingredient list.  Amazing!</li>
    <li> No visual difference on my skin, and I hate the runny watery consistency.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed with the way it feels.  It&#x27;s an odd color and I half expected it to feel sticky, but it isn&#x27;t.  It goes on smoothly.  I&#x27;ll purchase this again, and am looking forward to trying more of the OZ products.</li>
    <li> Not sure if it really contains retinol. It&#x27;s not doing anything for my skin. No peeling, no flaking, nothing. Retinol usually has some effect on my sensitive skin. This might be a ripoff. All the other reviewers got samples for an &amp;#34;honest&amp;#34; review. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have using for a few days and I can already tell a difference in my lines by my eyes.  I don&#x27;t notice them like before i started this.</li>
    <li> Not even one star, but this is the way the system is set up.  This was absolutely the worst hylaronic acid serum I have ever purchased.  I should have returned it immediately so that I did not waste my money.  I will not purchase another OZ Naturals product...very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but I don&#x27;t see any changes in my skin due to using this product or any of the other OZ Natural products that I purchased.</li>
    <li> Thank You lord be this product :)</li>
    <li> Works great. Just as OZ said it would. I love all his products I have Tried. Will reorder from this brand again sometime.</li>
    <li> Only have used for 30 days ! I have not noticed a big diffence! It doesn&#x27;t smell and is easy to use</li>
    <li> My facial skin is noticeably softer in less than a week. Pretty nice!</li>
    <li> I regret the long time I spent paying for the too expensive brands, while &amp;#34;OZ&amp;#34; was there with such a wonderful price &amp; results. My eyes look really different whether with make-up or without. This product gives them a very healthy &amp; fresh look.</li>
    <li> I used it for about 3 weeks and did not see any difference.  I actually felt my skin was getting dryer. The wrinkles seemed to get worse.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using OZ Naturals Retinol Serum for almost two months and I am very pleased with this product.  I use it for my nighttime regime followed by OZ Naturals moisturizer.  I like the feel of the retinol serum on my face, it is very light and soaks right in my skin.  I think it helps soften the lines in my 61 year old face.  I love all the OZ products that I use!  I will definitely continue to use Oz Naturals Retional Serum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some wrinkles coming in above my eye, and have been using this serum for about a week. Seems like it may be doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and lessening those wrinkles.</li>
    <li> My skin seems more smooth. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is outstanding. I am 33, and take incredibly great care of my skin and have used every product out there - no, really. I am seeing results on crows feet within 8 days, and smile lines within 10. I am using it twice a day (morning and night) and also putting it on my neck. I look better!</li>
    <li> I liked very much, thank you</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding product for a phenomenal price!  I can see a difference in my skin--much smoother!  It does not irritate the skin and helps makeup go on much nicer.</li>
    <li> i ordered  this serum 3 days ago and so far so good. I still need to wait for full results but I have to say that it  leaves my skin very soft .&lt;br /&gt;I been using it at night and when I wake up in the morning I am not greasy and skin glows. I am giving it 4 star because is to soo to see major changes.</li>
    <li> Not to impressed with results</li>
    <li> Fabulous .ordering more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure its good quality, but doesn&#x27;t stand out from other serums used in the past.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t review as I found out I am allergy to it. I have super sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> feel your skin tighten</li>
    <li> I read the reviews about the OZ Naturals Retinol Serum and it sounds like an amazing product so i ordered. When i apply the serum for the first time b-4 bed, i feel little tingly sensation on my skin. My face looks a bit red. Just thought that&#x27;s how it supposed to be. In the morning, i see little red bumps on my skin which is not normal at all. I tried for a week and i see no results except for the red bump on my skin. So i stop for a week and try the serum again. My skin actually look worse than when i&#x27;m not using it.  I waited and tried again and same thing happened. I normally have oily skin and after using this serum, my face started to breakout and it&#x27;s even oily than before using the product.This product does not work for me. I wish i can return it to get my money back since it&#x27;s of no use to me.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how this product worked because it arrived practically empty! Zero stars!</li>
    <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. This serum makes my skin feel so nice. I love how little you need to cover your face and neck.</li>
    <li> Not quite in love with this product yet.</li>
    <li> I have been loving OZ Naturals product. Best investment I have made on skin products so far. My daily skin routine is consisted of Oz naturals mineral face wash, vitamin c serum, rational serum, moisturizer and eye cream. And so far I am loving all of them. The Serums in particular. This retinol serum isn&#x27;t greasy at all and my skin absorbs it really well. It can leave your skin feeling a tad dry, which is why you are advised to use a moisturizer afterwards. Serum in general tend to make skins feel dry, so this isn&#x27;t this serum&#x27;s fault alone. However, I am really pleased with all of the products. I had acne scars, which is mainly why I purchased all the skin products and I have seen results only after using for a month. I used to use a lot of foundation to cover up my scars. Now I barely use any foundation, and am comfortable in my own skin (LITERALLY). Thank you OZ Naturals!</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews, I had high hopes this would help my skin. I broke out so badly from using the ocean minerals cleanser, the tonic &amp; retinol serum-  it&#x27;s embarrassing.  I hesitate to give a bad review because I love what this company stands for...just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Over priced. Little to no change after two months of use. Trying another brand. Thick and leaves an orange tint to my skin...not a glow.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of OZ Naturals Retinol Serum (my first bottle I received as an OZ promotion for an OZ review - easy to do). That alone speaks for itself.  I use it with the OZ Hyaluronic Serum and the OZ super youth retinol moisturizer at night. I actually look forward to waking up in the morning and taking that first glimpse of myself in the mirror.  At 59, people are always complimenting my skin, and most tell me I look like I&#x27;m in my mid 40s. Yes, I take great care of myself physically, but I give a lot of credit to OZ naturals. Because of their reasonable prices, I can take extra good care of my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Yes, all OZ Naturals are excellent.  The serum is REALLY good.  Will buy more</li>
    <li> I am in love with this!!  I love all the Oz Natural products!!  Tightens. Feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Came very quickly, used it asap and followed directions to a T. But didn&#x27;t see any results as other buyers had - but perhaps I haven&#x27;t used it long enough... I will keep incorporating it with my nightly regiment and will report any changes.</li>
    <li> I love OZ Naturals Serums, but when I saw they had a new one that included 2.5% retinol I was so excited. Retinol can do wonders for my skin, but not all moisturizers include it. So, it&#x27;s awesome that I can deliver this ingredient to my skin in the form of a serum. The serum itself is a bright orangey-pink color and has a texture that reminds me of a gel. It blends into the skin right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin, but I experienced absolutely no irritation with this product. And I noticed a huge difference soon after I began using the product. My skin looked fresher, brighter, and little breakouts that had popped up began to fade away. This is an excellent serum!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff... as I do other OZ Naturals products. I feel it working when I first put it on cause it seems to tingle a little bit. I&#x27;ve been using it about 10 days and so far so good - but I&#x27;ll review again after using it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Noticed difference after a few days. I use it regularly and love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product.  I&#x27;m in my second week and am starting to see a difference around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I use the Retinol Serum in my morning skin care regime. I have noticed that my skin looks clearer and brighter since I have begun using the serum. It is very lightweight and absorbs quickly into my skin. I have been very happy with all of the Oz Naturals products that I have used. I was given this product to try and review.</li>
    <li> Nice serum,  not sticky like some serum&#x27;s I have used.</li>
    <li> I just started using this but it seems, a little goes a long way. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m totally loving the OZ skin care line, and this retinol serum is an excellent addition! Works very gently but decisively in skimming off dead cells to reveal new, healthy skin. It absorbs quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. I added it to my nighttime regimen and within a week, my complexion was experiencing a really radiant, healthy glow, and all without redness or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also add that OZ products are, by and large, an excellent buy. This container was enormous and should easily last six months. I can&#x27;t recommend this skin care line highly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Product was provided for my honest review.</li>
    <li> The Oz Natural Retinol Serum has made a difference in the short time I have been using it. The dark spots are fading. My skin had a beautiful glow and softness. I have noticed less noticeable fine lines. I am happy to recieve this item to review. It&#x27;s a great addition to any daily beauty rountine!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I have to say I am a big fan of OZ Naturals&#x27; other products, and their Retinol Serum is no different. Its a great product. I leaves my skin feeling great. Once its applied, I forget its there. Its so light, and leaves my skin feeling soft thought out the day. Another plus is its totally curelty free being 100% vegan and not tested on animals...so clear beautiful skin and a clear mind...what more could you want?</li>
    <li> My skin has been through hell the last few months! I don&#x27;t what&#x27;s caused it. But, I know this serum has help my skin improve a lot! My skin feels so much smoother and looks a bit more youthful. Only time and more usage will tell how much it will improve. If it&#x27;s working, I&#x27;m all for it! I recommend this product. It&#x27;s great and it&#x27;s price isn&#x27;t too shabby either.</li>
    <li> Same thing. No difference at all. Save your money and invest in better products.</li>
    <li> Simply the BEST!! Cost is GREAT!!</li>
    <li> I love this product...I have to remember to reorder before I run out of it....</li>
    <li> After reading all the glowing reviews, I was so excited to try it out. The morning after, I noticed I had new acne around my chin. I played it off and hoped things would get better hoping that my skin just needed to adjust to the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, that was not the case. Each day, I just kept breaking out worse and worse. I&#x27;m new to oz naturals products but I have the vitamin c face wash, and I love it but this retinol serum has done nothing but cause my skin to break out relentlessly every day. Today, I&#x27;ve decided to stop using the retinol serum. I can no longer take the new breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I&#x27;ve ordered the vitamin c serum Instead. I&#x27;m hoping it won&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I will review that and I hope I have nothing but good things to say about that.</li>
    <li> I love all of Oz Natural products. I have a regimen going with them. I use this one at night because I did not like how it works with my makeup during the day. I have noticed an improvement in my skin after starting Oz skincare. I use the Organic Skin Toner (am/pm), Vitamin C Serum (am), Hyaluronic Acid Serum (am/pm) and the Super Youth Moisturizer. I&#x27;m 51 and look younger for using these products. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Excellent product I am going to order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MP</li>
    <li> not the best, not great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product, judging by reviews. Mine came in a sodden, sticky package with an empty container of serum. Obviously OZ Naturals needs to rethink their container as it leaked out all over the place.</li>
    <li> This feels very good on my skin. Since I have been using it, I have noticed my skin appears much more supple and youthful. I have received more attention and compliments than usual. I use the OZ Naturals Vitamin C-Serum in the morning and night, and at night, I add this on top of the Vitamin C. Noticeable results within days.</li>
    <li> Love this! I wash my face and then use witch hazel to tone, then apply small amounts of the serum.  I can already tell that&lt;br /&gt;some dark spots seem to be diminishing! I haven&#x27;t had any drying either, which surprised me because I have sensitive skin....EVERYTHING seems to dry it out...but not this product. Great stuff that actually works!! I will buy again when needed.  The small bottle is lasting longer than I thought it would too! So happy with it!</li>
    <li> Really good natural serum for hyperpigmentation.  I&#x27;ve been using pretty regularly for approx. 3 wks and my skin&#x27;s dark spots (caused by acne breakouts) have faded to the point that I can cover with a tinted moisturizer and a little spot correcting vs. full foundation.  I&#x27;m a long time Hydroquinone user but read that it can possibly cause cancer so I need an alternative. I&#x27;m a African-American woman in my early 50&#x27;s and my skin is brighter, smoother, softer. Also use the Oz Vitamin C, Tonic Toner, Retinol moisturizer, hylarounic acid + C serum.  Finding that for the money, Oz Naturals are pretty even with dermatological brands.</li>
