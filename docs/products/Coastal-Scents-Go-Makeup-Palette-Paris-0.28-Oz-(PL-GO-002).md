<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I did think the amount of eye shadow for each color was going to be a bit more. The picture makes it look bigger then it is. The colors are nice but with some of them you have to use alot of product.</li>
    <li> Coastal scents shadows  are great.</li>
    <li> Nice little deal. The colors are as they appear. Then again I always wear eyeshadow base. But all in all nice little palette.</li>
    <li> For the lady on the go and who wants lots of different looks the coastal scents go palettes are the thing to buy love the colors and they are very pigmented. Try them out you will be glad u did.</li>
    <li> I love the variety of colors. The quality is alright; it is a little on the loose side. Other than that, these colors are fun to use and come in a small compact which is a good space saver. If you are a make up guru, I wouldn&#x27;t buy these. If you&#x27;re someone like me who likes to &amp;#34;play&amp;#34; or mess around with make up and not take it seriously, I would buy these. The size of the shadows are about the size of a penny.</li>
    <li> The colors of these shadows are very nice. They are beautiful, practical shades, no neon. I was very pleased by the quality of this set.</li>
    <li> I grew up on Dior, Borghese and Indra shadows. These are very pretty in the palette, but the pigment is insignificant and the powder doesn&#x27;t cling well. Was hoping for more drama. Back to $$$.</li>
    <li> good colors but not very pigmented. had to use a strong eye primer to get color to show</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re used to high quality eyeshadows this will disappoint you. I found that they did not go on smoothly or blend very well. Maybe good for play or to see if some colors look good on you before you make a bigger investment on high quality shadows.</li>
    <li> This is my first Coast Scents product. I purchased it because it was one of the cheaper items and I wanted to see what the brand was like before spending more money on a larger pallet. I was very surprised by the amount of pigment that this tiny case holds. Colors are bold, true and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back is the size of the color discs. They are about the size of a dime. Rather small, but it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of shadow to get a bold look.</li>
    <li> I Love this palette , the Dark plum/burgundy Color is so delicious with My &#x27;brown eyes&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;I use My ( 24 tattoo cream eyeshadow from maybelline as a primer ) first then apply any color from this palette &amp; the colors will POP-OUT so beautifully , Just play with them and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results ! they blend so easy .&lt;br /&gt;*I recommend using a Primer/paintpod.. First to make the eyeshadow more alive :)</li>
    <li> I love the shades in this eye shadow pallete.  The quality of the eye shadows is very good as well considering the price.  I think I&#x27;ll buy Moscow pallete next.</li>
    <li> This is the first palette I&#x27;ve had from Coastal Scents and I&#x27;m very impressed. The quality of these eyeshadows are great, they have a little pigment, a little goes a long way for me. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> Great colors, goes on nicely, wears well as compared to other pricey brands. Will definitely purchase more colors! Coastal Scents offers a variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Everything is nice. I just happened to buy two Go palettes with almost the same colors. I would recommend to buy the 88 color palettes because it has all the colors the GO palettes have.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been hard for me to find makeup that compliments my skin tone.  I&#x27;m african american and all of these colors look great on me.  I used the Elf primer and it lasts all day.  No creases or having to reapply.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors and very pigmented. Great product. Small and easy to carry and can take this everywhere. Just like the name Go Palette.</li>
    <li> The colors are so rich and the whole palette is VERY pigmented. I love the warm browns, and the pop of blue they give you. Very sturdy case but light enough to be taken on the go.</li>
    <li> I liked the colors of this palette . I&#x27;m familiar with costal scents their eye shadows provide a decent pigment pay out but my palette arrived with one of the color pan all crumbled which I could live with then when I tired to put the excess crumbles in the trash 4 of the pans fell out of the palette ...this thing is going back!</li>
    <li> Works well with my color scheme well. I can wash these off well and they last when wearing any of these colors and you can combine them also.</li>
    <li> For $9 dollars there was no application included??! Not to mention that the eye shadow does&#x27;nt apply well. Don&#x27;t waste your money, the Dollar Store has better make up. ( And that&#x27;s saying something )</li>
    <li> First of all this is a Great palette for dark women&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigmentation is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; and Last a good length with primer</li>
    <li> This is a really good product, the colors are rich and it looks much more expensive than what it costs. I use my mac brushes to apply it on my eyelids.</li>
    <li> Love Coastal Scents eye shadows. You can use a small amount of product and get great color pay off.  I have the London palette also.</li>
    <li> I donated it - it was to dark for my complexion.</li>
