<li> My mother used a nail whitening pencil long time ago.</li>
<li> Have used them for a long time.  </li>
<li> The white part falls out while the pencil grinds down to nothing.</li>
<li> When wet (per limited instructions)</li>
<li> Works exactly as I expected.</li>
<li> This product doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly as I expected.  </li>
<li> I have been using nail white pencils since my teen years, but they&#x27;re tough to find.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
<li> the prodect was useless much to soft and it plainly does not do the job..</li>
<li> Flowery ones are, bigger, and less expensive.</li>
<li> Almost looks like a french manicure but a LOT less expensive.  </li>
<li> The only problem is that they are difficult to sharpen.</li>
<li> I have used another brand for years and have had a hard time finding them in my area</li>
<li> Hard to find at the drugstore...</li>
<li> I could not find these pencils anywhere, after a disappointing search I finally found them on Amazon.  </li>
<li> DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!!!  </li>
<li> Not perfect, but would recommend.</li>
<li> Impossible to get under the nails unless your nails are super-long.</li>
<li> It gets all over your skin and none on your nail :(</li>
<li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
<li> These are awful.</li>

    <li> I have used these pencils for many years. There are different brands but they are basically all the same. The only problem is that they are difficult to sharpen. The white part falls out while the pencil grinds down to nothing. I&#x27;m not finding fault with Flowery. It is just the nature of the beast.</li>
    <li> Impossible to get under the nails unless your nails are super-long. Mine are not, average length. When wet (per limited instructions) it smears all over the fingertips. I can&#x27;t get it to work properly.</li>
    <li> Good product - good buy!</li>
    <li> Helps make my nails look clean &amp; finished!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding the white nail pencils and was delighted to get these. I don&#x27;t polish my nails, so it really looks nice to have really white fingernail tips.</li>
    <li> These are very nice. They don&#x27;t get your nails electric white, but they are vey good and making your nails look natural. I just run it under my nails for a few minutes once or twice a week and my nails look great! I am ordering more! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead for 5 is because the intensity of the whiteness may not be enough for some people.</li>
    <li> I could not find these pencils anywhere, after a disappointing search I finally found them on Amazon.  Just what I needed to keep my nails looking good and natural.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as I expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Great for times in between polish, gives clean almost French-manicure look to nails.</li>
    <li> the prodect was useless much to soft and it plainly does not do the job..&lt;br /&gt;REVLON MAKES THE BEST BUT WE CAN&#x27;T FIND THEM..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HELP</li>
    <li> These are awful. Didn&#x27;t work at all and left too much residue on the skin under my nails. I ended up throwing them away.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly as I expected.  I did not create a French manicure look.  It also washes off when you wash your hands.</li>
    <li> They give a French manicure look without the manicure.  Have used them for a long time.  I like them very much!</li>
    <li> I garden a lot and don&#x27;t wear gloves.  When its time for work, I use this and my nails look fab.</li>
    <li> Great value--three pens for the price of what you would pay for one in  the store.  To brighten nails, just run nails under water, swipe the pencil under each nail and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Can&#x27;t find these at any of our local stores. Although it is not permanent...I enjoy the feel of clean white nails and it seems to also condition. My nails always grow longer using this product.</li>
    <li> Almost looks like a french manicure but a LOT less expensive.  Great for quick touch ups between manicures and adds a nice finishing touch to natural nails or clear polish.</li>
    <li> Got them for my Mom who is an avid gardener.</li>
    <li> I have bought f Flowery nail pencil before which came with a see thru cap, and was very happy with them.  However this time the white lead inside is too big.  Since it is very soft, I had to sharpen the ENTIRE FIRST PENCIL DOWN TO 3 inches before lead was stable!!  The cap is a cheap plastic which is not easy to use on cuticles.  I will go back to paying the higher priced pencil with the see thru cap. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE!!!  I am returning them to Amazon this week.</li>
    <li> Works well for my garden-stained fingernails.</li>
    <li> The lids are angled to help clean out under your nails. The pencil colors in under your nail. It&#x27;s not as permanent as a french manicure, but it helps.</li>
    <li> Flowery Nail White Pencil - works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More effective than Sally Hansen pencil on my nails. Not perfect, but would recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using nail white pencils since my teen years, but they&#x27;re tough to find.&lt;br /&gt;These are great, sharpen easily, &amp; last for many weeks with daily use. I moisten the tip with water &amp; slide it under nail tips for a great French manicure look w/o the price!</li>
    <li> I received these promptly... But, they do not work. It gets all over your skin and none on your nail :( I&#x27;m disappointed. I refuse to use them! They work just as well as a colored pencil. I think that&#x27;s what they are!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work washes right off</li>
    <li> Great, especially because you can&#x27;t find these out at regular stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Very nice. My mother used a nail whitening pencil long time ago. So, I have used one, too. This is a much better product than I had been using, which was no longer available. Looks like a French with no polish.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a product such as this, it is perfect.</li>
    <li> The white flakes off and leaves the tips of your fingers chalky.</li>
    <li> Makes your nails look clean. It is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Excellent The order arrived in a timely manner and was exactly what I expected</li>
    <li> It whitens my nails.  No Problem.</li>
    <li> I am thrilled to receive two sets of 3 pencils each of the Flowery Nail White Pencils from Amazon&#x27;s Seller at such a good price.  To me nothing is more beautiful than healthy looking nails and these Flowery Nail White Pencils provide that look when dampened with water and applied under the dampened nail.  Voil&amp;aacute;.  The pencil manages to clean the under nail as well as apply the white kaolin clay color giving a French Manicure look with just the addition of clear or tinted nail polish.  This is a staple in nail care for me and I am happy to find them here on Amazon.  This looks particularly nice with [[ASIN:B00B8Z2LRQ Pink Armor Nail Growth Formula Treatments, 0.50 Fluid Ounce]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3-25-15:  Today I received only 3 actual pencils but they were from a different Seller where I WILL NOT purchase from again.  I left 3 stars for that Seller but always 5 stars for these wonderful white nail pencils.</li>
    <li> dont bother with these, they totally dont work. they are too hard, even if wet to make your nails nice. they smear all over the finger instead of adhering to the underside of the nail. maybe it&#x27;s me, but i wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Hard to find at the drugstore... this is a pack of 3 nice size pencils. Gives a lovely French manicure look.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere, so I purchased on Amazon.  Work well (best when damp under nail).</li>
    <li> Makes you look like you have a french polish if you couple it with clear polish and run the white pencil under the tip of your nail.</li>
    <li> Love!  Sharpens without breaking.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work that well</li>
    <li> These do not work well</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Sally Hanson nail pencils before, but after using the Flowery nail pencil, I&#x27;m sticking with it.  It has more point durability than the Sally Hanson pencil, and the white stays under the nail for longer.  I was very pleased with the result! I also use Yello-Out clear acrylic top coat, which enhances the whiteness and adds just a touch of pink to the rest of the nail.  A very easy, surprisingly lasting French manicure at home that even a guy can do.</li>
    <li> These Flowery nail pencils are wonderful.  I have used another brand for years and have had a hard time finding them in my area recently.&lt;br /&gt;The Flowery ones are, bigger, and less expensive. I am so happy that I found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great buy. Works as well as the expensive Sally Hansen, and is so much more economical.</li>
    <li> I love the ease of these pencils  - no matter what shape my nails are in  - using these as a final touch makes them my Five star &amp;#34;manicure Go To&amp;#34;</li>
