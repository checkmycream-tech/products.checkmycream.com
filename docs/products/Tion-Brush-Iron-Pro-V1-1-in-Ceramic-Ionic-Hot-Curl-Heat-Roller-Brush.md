      <li>I guess you have to pay more to get quality.  </li>

      <li>Wife and Mother love this.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold and because there is a plastic tip that doesn&#x27;t heat up, I haven&#x27;t burned myself, yet.</li>
      <li>The design makes it easy to hold and wrap around the hair.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>I love how it is sooo super easy to use just as advertised.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t stand curling irons with clamps because they snag my fine hair, and I never got the hang of wands.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone with healthier hair that does not tend to be very dry, like mine.&lt;br</li>

      <li>it causes the decrease of overall credit of this product despite of its great working as a curling iron.</li>
      <li>It is light and compact, so no issues traveling with it.</li>

      <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>

      <li>I am so happy I spent a few dollars more and have great hair every day.</li>
      <li>The tool heats up quickly and maintains the heat throughout the session.</li>
      <li>/&gt;You need to hold the button down to change temperatures and turn off which is actually a great design feature.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use and fast to heat up.</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t as large as I was looking for, but it does a fantastic job.</li>
      <li>Worth it?</li>
      <li>I found the Tion Bruch and help achieve that, especially when I am traveling, no time for rollers, this comes handy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another reviewer mentioned this tip,and I thought it would be worth mentioning again if you don&#x27;t read all reviews:  </li>
      <li>Useful, makes easier setting hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my hair tangled in it right away.</li>
      <li>Easy to use professional styling tool!</li>
      <li>It doesnt make your hair super straight like CHI&#x27;s</li>
      <li>Curls your hair quickly and heats up fast.</li>
      <li>I had a cheap brush iron that I really liked until it died after a few months.</li>
      <li>It heats up very fast.  </li>
      <li>This is the first iron that I have had that doesn&#x27;t eventually frizz up my hair.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it, it got caught in my hair and took 2 people 20 minutes to get it out.  </li>
      <li>It performs multiple times better than the off the rack items at retailers.  </li>
      <li>Doesnt&#x27; get hot at the tips</li>
      <li>My hair stylist has the exact model and when she used it on my hair</li>
      <li>It does not blow hot hair (I have one of these too - it&#x27;s called a hot air brush).</li>
      <li>Got rid of 3 hot roller sets and 4 curling iron/brushes.  </li>
      <li>this does the trick exactly.  </li>
      <li>I have burned myself so many times with my curling iron, only to end up with &amp;#34;turd roll&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>You can still touch hot metal, but the likelihood is reduced because of the design.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much always went with the cheapest ones.  </li>
      <li>So right now, I am not getting nice curls from this tool because it is too big around for my current haircut..</li>
      <li>was looking for a large barrel bristle curler.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize there could such a huge difference in curling brushes/curling irons.  </li>
      <li>iron didn&#x27;t come with a manual, so you really need to watch the videos --</li>
      <li>This product works very well.</li>
      <li>So, spend 5 minutes checking out their website and you will be very pleased!&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>If left  to the &amp;#34; free twirl&amp;#34; around the brush without my &amp;#34;help&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t tangle and get caught in the bristles.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m so excited to say my search is finally over.  </li>
      <li>It took me about 20 minutes to finish my long, wavy and fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I used many different curling iron tools, but most of time hair looks not much good or sometimes my hair damaged.  </li>
      <li>I mostly use it because my hair gets too wavy and frizzy in the high humidity that I live in and I use the curling iron to tame the frizz.</li>
      <li>Super long cord.</li>
      <li>not, like other tools, where the light blinks and then turns solid when hot.</li>
      <li>This iron only gets hot at the bottom part of the bristiles.  </li>
      <li>By the end of the day, my hair would finally begin to look like how I wanted it to in the first place.  </li>
      <li>After watching the video, it was pretty obvious why.</li>
      <li>My hair is long (middle of my shoulder blades) and on the fine side of the scale.</li>
      <li>I bought a regular curling iron I really like.</li>
      <li>My hair felt so soft and shiny.  </li>
      <li>The top layer is naturally curly/wavy, the bottom layer is naturally straight and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl (usually gone straight within a few hours).</li>
      <li>I dry mine first and use a heat protector.</li>
      <li>my long hair, this is very convenient to make grace curling.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I expected too much about it</li>
      <li>I only use it twice so far, is works.</li>
      <li>It takes me a little while achieve this because I&#x27;m spastic and have to learn which way to hold the brush to produce a curl in the right direction without poking my eye out.</li>
      <li>In my experience, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get a decent hot styling tool for under $100.</li>

    <li> Loved it works great to curl my hair in a shorter amount of time than my curling iron.</li>
    <li> I love how it is sooo super easy to use just as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works well when I need to add volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this product.&lt;br /&gt;With my long hair, this is very convenient to make grace curling.&lt;br /&gt;However, after several times of use, the temperature setting was broken.&lt;br /&gt;It fixed on 320&#x27;F and I can&#x27;t change the temperature setting at all.&lt;br /&gt;Since I usually use that temperature to make curl, it&#x27;s not big problem to me,&lt;br /&gt;but it causes the decrease of overall credit of this product despite of its great working as a curling iron.</li>
    <li> Wife and Mother love this. She killed the first one in europe with an AC power adapter however. Had to buy a second, so dont take it across the pond.</li>
    <li> Easy to use professional styling tool! Very pleased with the quality! My hair stylist has the exact model and when she used it on my hair I fell in love with the volume, body and curl this tool gave me. My curl held nicely without any styling product. Great purchase!</li>
    <li> The Tron Brush was a gift for my daughter-in-law, she says she loves it because she was always burning herself with her regular curling iron. Her curl seems to last longer...</li>
    <li> I love the temperature setting controls. I have thin fine hair and my daughter has thick wavy hair. I can use the brush on 340* and she can go up to 420*. It&#x27;s very easy to use and adds a lot of lift and body to my hair without drying or burning it. Heats up very quickly. My mother purchased one of these irons from her hairdresser and loves it. Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> I expected too much about it but the product wasn&#x27;t for me; it didn&#x27;t curl well for my coarse hair. It may work for others.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday to straighten my hair. It doesnt make your hair super straight like CHI&#x27;s but you can tell this product does not harm your hair</li>
    <li> This product works great.  I was looking for something like it with a curling brush that I could use while my hair was still wet (or damp) and this does the trick exactly.  Love it.  Doesnt&#x27; get hot at the tips so you can put your hand on it to assist and drys my hair while curling it.  Even bought one for my mother for Xmas.</li>
    <li> In my experience, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to get a decent hot styling tool for under $100. I had a cheap brush iron that I really liked until it died after a few months. I can&#x27;t stand curling irons with clamps because they snag my fine hair, and I never got the hang of wands. Reviews of other hot brushes were all pretty bad, with many complaints of broken teeth, etc., so I decided to spend extra money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My iron didn&#x27;t come with a manual, so you really need to watch the videos -- http://www.tronhair.com/tion-brush-iron-video-tips/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The controls confused me at first, because it blinks when it&#x27;s -ready- not, like other tools, where the light blinks and then turns solid when hot. It heats up extremely fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need to hold the button down to change temperatures and turn off which is actually a great design feature. It&#x27;s really annoying to have an iron shut off or change temperatures while you are in the middle of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my hair tangled in it right away. After watching the video, it was pretty obvious why. So, spend 5 minutes checking out their website and you will be very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it says it&#x27;s a dryer which I cannot imagine. It does not blow hot hair (I have one of these too - it&#x27;s called a hot air brush). If you used this on wet hair I would think it would fry your hair. I dry mine first and use a heat protector.</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight hair.  The first time I used it, it got caught in my hair and took 2 people 20 minutes to get it out.  I was about to chop off a huge piece to get it out.  don&#x27;t recommend!</li>
    <li> I have thin and fine hair, I use rollers to make my hair fluffy and not too flat. I found the Tion Bruch and help achieve that, especially when I am traveling, no time for rollers, this comes handy. But some times it could burn my hand if touched the tip or too close to the center.</li>
    <li> This is the best iron that I have ever purchased.  I guess you have to pay more to get quality.  This iron only gets hot at the bottom part of the bristiles.  It is heat adjustable to your type of hair.  This is the first iron that I have had that doesn&#x27;t eventually frizz up my hair.</li>
    <li> Useful, makes easier setting hair.</li>
    <li> I am not good for hair styling.  I used many different curling iron tools, but most of time hair looks not much good or sometimes my hair damaged.  But this Tion brush curling iron work very easy and make hair looks nice.  I am happy for my purchase.</li>
    <li> My hair length is to my neck and it is layered. This product works very well. It doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair. It&#x27;s easy to hold and because there is a plastic tip that doesn&#x27;t heat up, I haven&#x27;t burned myself, yet. It only takes me a few minutes. I mostly use it because my hair gets too wavy and frizzy in the high humidity that I live in and I use the curling iron to tame the frizz. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This IronPro is wonderful and I use it all the time</li>
    <li> Curls your hair quickly and heats up fast. Super long cord. Hair feels silky after curling.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! I gave it to her for her birthday (yes, it was her idea...)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She took it with her when we went to Seattle a couple of weeks ago. It is light and compact, so no issues traveling with it. She loves the different heat settings too. Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still working on getting the knack of this.  I wanted something that was smaller than my electric rollers (they take up a lot of space when traveling),  and would not burn my skin when using it like a curling iron.  The brush is 3/4&amp;#34; and before anyone asks, it only has the one size brush and is not made to have interchangeable brushes.  I can produce a little softer curl that holds.  It takes me a little while achieve this because I&#x27;m spastic and have to learn which way to hold the brush to produce a curl in the right direction without poking my eye out. Practice makes perfect.  The tool heats up quickly and maintains the heat throughout the session. There are 4 settings on  my brush - 280 degrees, 320 degrees, 360 degrees and my favorite,  400 degrees.  It seems the only time my hair has gotten caught in the brush is when I try to  &amp;#34;help&amp;#34;  it around the brush.  If left  to the &amp;#34; free twirl&amp;#34; around the brush without my &amp;#34;help&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t tangle and get caught in the bristles.</li>
    <li> The Tion Brush Iron does a good job of smoothing my fine, shorter hair that is naturally frizzy.  The design makes it easy to hold and wrap around the hair.  You can still touch hot metal, but the likelihood is reduced because of the design.  It heats up very fast.  I have learned to  keep it on the lower settings as it will fry my hair if I don&#x27;t.  I also do not linger on any one hair section for the same reason.  And I cannot use it everyday with my hair type, even on the lowest setting. I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone with healthier hair that does not tend to be very dry, like mine.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned this tip,and I thought it would be worth mentioning again if you don&#x27;t read all reviews:  in order to change the heat setting, you need to hold down the on/off button while making the selection.  This was not intuitive for me and I appreciated the other reviewer&#x27;s mention since it is not addressed in the instruction booklet.&lt;br /&gt;I give 4 stars here because i got a larger size than the one I ordered.  Amazon gave me a discount to keep it, which is OK since I am trying to grow my hair.  So right now, I am not getting nice curls from this tool because it is too big around for my current haircut..</li>
    <li> Disappointing! Product arrived and it doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT! Easy to use and it gives me amazing results. Heats very fast and you can touch it without burning your hands.i curl my hair with it and the curls are amazing and perfect</li>
    <li> Very nice product.  Hair style stays well for long time.  It is easy to use and fast to heat up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a curling brush iron for quite some time and I&#x27;m so excited to say my search is finally over.  I was hesitant to try this product because of the price.  Then, I couldn&#x27;t find a lot of reviews online until I did  a search on Youtube and saw a few videos that helped me make the decision.  I bought it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It took me about 20 minutes to finish my long, wavy and fine hair.  I simply loved the curls.  My hair felt so soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m not sure if it will straighten my hair well but the curls look amazing.  I hope they last at least throught the night.  I&#x27;ll update my review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After almost a year of use, I&#x27;m still in love with this brush iron!  If you are looking for volume and beautiful bouncy curls,  this is the right tool for you...</li>
    <li> Have only used it as a curling iron and for me it works great.  Fine,thin hair has body and curl.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
    <li> I HAVE SHORT HAIR AND IT WORKS PERFECT,WORTH EVERY PENNY .I REALY LIKE THIS IRON.I GET LOT OF COMPLEMENTS WHIT MY HAIR.</li>
    <li> While I love what the iron does for my hair, it makes it super shiny and manageable and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is damaging my hair, it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl as well as I had hoped.  The iron doesn&#x27;t heat up beyond the second level and it is a bit confusing when dryer is included in the description, but the iron does not have that feature.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize there could such a huge difference in curling brushes/curling irons.  I&#x27;ve pretty much always went with the cheapest ones.  Boy, was I wrong!  My hair is thin and poker straight.  I have burned myself so many times with my curling iron, only to end up with &amp;#34;turd roll&amp;#34; curls.  By the end of the day, my hair would finally begin to look like how I wanted it to in the first place.  The Tion Pro V 4-in1 gives me perfect hair immediately!  Lots of body, shine, and just enough shape on my ends.  I can go 3 days without having to use it again.  Unbelievable.  Got rid of 3 hot roller sets and 4 curling iron/brushes.  Not going to need them ever again.  I am so happy I spent a few dollars more and have great hair every day.</li>
    <li> This was not for me.  It got tangled in my hair twice and didn&#x27;t dry or curl that well.  I feel I wasted my money and I couldn&#x27;t find my receipt so I&#x27;m stuck with it.  I bought a regular curling iron I really like.</li>
    <li> What Amazon&#x27;s description is missing:&lt;br /&gt;Barrel size: one inch&lt;br /&gt;Titanium plates on bristles: every other row has the plating on the lower half of the bristles, the alternate rows have no plating&lt;br /&gt;Temp Control: you have to hold the on/off switch on then select the up arrow to increase the temperature&lt;br /&gt;Tron Hair is now Tion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a large barrel bristle curler. This isn&#x27;t as large as I was looking for, but it does a fantastic job. My hair is long (middle of my shoulder blades) and on the fine side of the scale. The top layer is naturally curly/wavy, the bottom layer is naturally straight and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl (usually gone straight within a few hours). With this iron I still have some curl left 24 hours later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive? Yes, I paid $111 for it. Worth it? That&#x27;s for you to decide. I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
    <li> The product description (here on Amazon and on any other site showing this brush iron) says \\&quot;4-in-1: Dryer + Straightener + Curling Iron + Brush\\&quot;.  I thought this meant it had an air drying feature but it does not.  That was a little disappointing, because while I didn&#x27;t think I would use the feature often, it sounded like a healthier way to dry my hair than a standard dryer.  Ceramic barrel and all.  Even so, it curls like a dream.  My hair never gets caught, and I feel like it is easier on my color-treated hair than a typical iron.  Of course the price is crazy, but it is put into perspective when you figure what we gals spend on a salon visit.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I only use it twice so far, is works.</li>
    <li> I am worth it!  I thought this product was pricey but bought it anyway.  I am glad i purchased it.  It performs multiple times better than the off the rack items at retailers.  It works, and I recommend it without reservation.</li>
