<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this because over the years two diff dermatologists recommended for my dark circles. But while I think it does add moisture, I don&#x27;t notice any real changes. The bottle does last forever. So still use</li>
    <li> I have a problem with bags under my eyes that no amount of rest cures.  Lumiere helps to minimize their appearance</li>
    <li> Use this cream all the time.  Have tried many and this is the best by far.  Received exactly as promised.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I was originally prescribed this eye cream by my dermotologist. I used it for a few months and was very happy with the results. When I purchased this eye creeam this time, something was off. The smell and consistency did not feel the same. It feels thinner and does not have the familiar smell of my original one. I have been using it for a month and do not have the same results.</li>
    <li> I just received this on Saturday so it&#x27;s too soon to truly tell, but I am hopeful that this product will live up to it&#x27;s reputation and other reviews. Feels good when applied.</li>
    <li> I can actually SEE where the little side lines from the eyes has flatened out! Really nice moisture without gooey feel. The best eye cream  I have ever used</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neocutis line for about 2 years.  The line costs a lot more from my dermatologist and I had reservations about whether or not the product was making a difference.  I am a 43 year old African American woman who is trying to get a jump start on the aging process.  I can say that when I decided to stop using the product I could tell a remarkable difference in my skin from when I was using the product.  The price on Amazon is much lower than my dermatologist and I do feel like the cost is worth it.  The product I got from the seller was just the same as when I get it from the Dr. so I will continue to use this seller.</li>
    <li> I use this twice a day around and under my eyes; it&#x27;s just fantastic stuff.  I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
    <li> Have been using Neocutis eye cream for years and definitely see small lines disappear.  Although pricing is high, its worth the investment.  Less expensive to buy through Amazon than your dermologist.</li>
    <li> I am not allergic to anything and my eyes can withstand every type of makeup I have ever put on them. However, the Neocutis eye cream burns my eye very, very badly. Too bad I had to pay over $50 to find discover this. Why they would put any kind of irritant in a cream you use o your eyes is a mystery to me. I&#x27;ve ended up using the cream on other parts of my face, but am not sure if it does anything or not.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Works well for dark circles.</li>
    <li> I was very apprehensive about spending this kind of money on an eye cream but it really makes a big difference.. The dark circles under my eyes have diminished in severity, fine lines, and bags have also become less noticeable. I could see a very noticeable difference within a week of using this eye cream. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle cream but it does make a big difference in comparison to other eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> I was so allergic to something in this product, I had trouble using it. My eyes watered up and swelled. On top of that, for the couple days I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Keeps the skin around my eyes hydrated and soft all day, even under makeup.  I must use a lot of under eye coverup and this product is the only one that works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products over the years and this is on the top of my list for dry eye skin and dark circles.</li>
    <li> I just found out today that the PSP ingredient in this eye cream is derived from aborted fetuses.  Sorry to shock you, but that is the truth.  This product should warn the consumer or I never would have purchased it.  I am tossing it out, even though it did a help the puffiness in my eye area.  I am traumatized that PSP manufactured from children who are aborted, and their skin and organs sold by Planned Parenthood and bought by those who put them in some of these and other products for consumer use.  Youtube also has a video. &amp;#34;Baby Fetus in Food, Drinks &amp; Makeup.&amp;#34; Watch it.</li>
    <li> The best so far for under eye dark circles.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. It provides great moisture for under and above eyes. I use it during the morning as well as at night.</li>
    <li> I love Neocutis Eye Cream.  Have been using it for over 10 years now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately 4 years.  I love it.  My dermatologist recommended it and it has made a tremendous difference in the fine lines under my eyes.  I also tend to have lots of under eye puffiness which it does a great job of reducing.  I have used the Obagi eye cream and I have found Lumiere to be superior.  I conducted an experiment using the Obagi on one eye and the Lumiere on the other.  I asked my dermatologist to examine each eye without telling her which product I had used on which eye.  We conducted this experiment over a 10 week period whereby she reviewed the results once a month.  Each time, she picked the Lumiere eye because it decreased under eye puffiness more than Obagi did.  I did not tell her until the 10th week which product she had picked.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this product from Amazon so I can&#x27;t comment on the quality sold here but this product is a great product. I have used a lot of under eye products. Dr. Brandt eye gel burned my eyes so bad that it took three days of AquaFor slathered on them to \\&quot;heal.\\&quot; So I guess you can say I have fairly sensitive skin. This product doesn&#x27;t feel like a strong product but it works! I am 28 years old with fine lines underneath my eyes and crows feet only when I smile. I think its harder to find a product to work on the small stuff than it is to find a product that has dramatic results on major eye puffiness and lines. This product actually improves those pesky fine lines you can&#x27;t seem to get rid of. I use it morning and night after I let my antioxidant serum soak in and it leaves my under eye area so soft. In fact, in the mornings, my concealer just glides over it- no balling up like some products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a problem with darkness under my eyes... I work full time, I&#x27;m sleep deprived, don&#x27;t drink enough water, and am a single Mom! Of course I have dark circles, right?! This product does reduce some of the darness but if there are a few nights that you don&#x27;t get enough sleep, you will notice the darkness is more prominent. BUT, it is still improved and better than it would have been had you not used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a miracle cream.... you won&#x27;t look like a freshed eyed teenager but it did make a huge improvement in my under eye area- think \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot; every morning.</li>
    <li> On a trip to my Dermotologist, she recommended the Neocutis Eye Cream.  Luckily I found it on Amazon at a lower price.  I use it day and night and the skin around my eyes look so much better.  I&#x27;m 59 and really needed a good eye cream.  You can always use it just a night and use another eye cream during the day.  Try it, it works!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years but from different sellers.  I did not check when I received this product whether the bottle was full.  All I know is that it ran out much more quickly in the past.  I have oredered from another seller the same product and you can rest well assured that I will check the contents of the bottle upon receipt.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until I had opened this product that it was not the cream (which I had used in the past and which I had ordered) but a new product called a &amp;#34;balm.&amp;#34;  After two days, my eyes started getting irritated and I didn&#x27;t use the product any more.  I would caution people to make sure that they receive the product that they ordered and not to assume, based on past experience with the cream, that the balm will not be irritating or cause an allergic reaction.  The ingredients differ enough that having good results with one doesn&#x27;t indicate that you&#x27;ll have good ones with the other.</li>
    <li> AMAZON HAD BEST PRICE AND SHIPPED IN 2 DAYS.  PRODUCT IS SUPER I HAVE USED MANY EYE CREAMS INCLUDING THE EXPENSIVE LA MER THIS ONE IS EXCELLENT</li>
    <li> I have tired eyes underneath from loss of sleep sometimes busy with my 2 year old and always had dark circles underneath as a child, I was actually getting ready to have cosmetic surgery for under my eyes as I am 44, but after using this product i will say it worked like magic after a couple of days of using this.  You can also wear it under foundation, I apply it morning and before I go to sleep after using make-up remover, I will keep buying this as it really works and I love it!!!! Also wanted to add, my 21 year old daughter thought I had botox around my eyes, she came down for a visit from college, I hadn&#x27;t seen her in a few months and the first thing she said was wow my did you get botox!!!</li>
    <li> My wife really likes this stuff. She says it reduces puffiness and dark circles. I tried it and think it&#x27;s OK, thus between the two of us I gave it a four 4 star review. You do go through the 0.5 oz container fairly quickly if you conscienciously use it morning and evening. Recommend you use it twice a day but sparingly.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I can see the difference when I do not use it. I would recommend it for anyone. Hands down the best eye cream I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dermatologist to help lighten under-eye circles.&lt;br /&gt;Mind are not bad but I didn&#x27;t want them to get worse.  I use this every morning and before I go to bed or&lt;br /&gt;any time I just want my eye area to glow a little.  Over time (a few weeks), I&#x27;ve noticed a much youthful&lt;br /&gt;appearance to my eyes and the dark circles are disappearing.  It does not happen over night because it takes&lt;br /&gt;time for the product to work.  However, every time you use this product it gives the skin around your eyes a special glow by&lt;br /&gt;slightly illuminating the skin.  I love it for every day, with or without make up!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes in my under eye area. I haven&#x27;t been using the product very long so, I will finish off bottle and then decide.</li>
    <li> I gave been using fir two years now.  I bought it after Botox injections.  In order to maintain wrinkle free look; this was re cemented by Dr&#x27;s. Office</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.  Promise u won&#x27;t be disappointed.  ;)</li>
    <li> This is a great product for the eyes.  I use this in conjunction with the Neocutis Bio-restorative Cream with PSP</li>
    <li> Oh yes!! This is great stuff!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year now. I was introduced to it by an esthetician. There is no irritation and my eyes feel hydrated. I&#x27;m a 40 yr old African American women and I&#x27;ve been told countless times that I look 27.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now, it came recommended by my doctor of 13  years, whom I highly trust. I love it, will never stop using it.</li>
    <li> Use it regularly alternating between two other hi-end eye creams and it works.</li>
    <li> Not my favorite.  Very little product for the price and nothing outstanding about this eye cream.</li>
    <li> I have been using NeocurtisI Journee and Lumiere for many years.  Very satisfied with both products.  My one complaint that kept the Journee from being a five star is they changed the packaging.  I don&#x27;t like the new pump.  You can no longer tell how much product is left and it gets hard sometimes on the end of the pump and I get a hard blob the size of a mole that doesn&#x27;t blend in.  Looks like I have a brown spot.  Please go back to the previous bottle which did not have these issues.  It wasn&#x27;t broke as they say.</li>
    <li> I hope I am not going to be disappointed. Previously, I was very happy with the produc. But this time the product that I received did not match the packaging shown on this item. This time when I opened it, I thought, oh no, they sent something else by mistake. When I took a closer look at the wording, even though it is not the same, there is a chance it is the same product. This time it came in a bright aqua blue box with white wording. The actual product, looking from above, is oval with a bright silver-tone cap. Below that is a aqua blue tube enclosed in a thick Plexiglas clear housing. Looks a lot fancier than the original. Why would they show the product one way and deliver something that looks totally different? I don&#x27;t like having to put a rating since I feel the rating should be for the product but not the packaging. But, getting something that looks totally different than what I ordered is a negative and therefore I will rate it three stars.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this product several years ago.  At first I was skeptical but after a week or so, I noticed a big difference in the fine lines around my eyes. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and won&#x27;t even try anything else.  This product performs!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I try this. I love this product! I have always had dark circles under my eyes and this stuff does help diminish them.</li>
    <li> Neocutis eye cream is great.  I have dark circles under my eyes and this helps alot.  I doesn&#x27;t completely obliterate them but much improved.  It only takes a very small dot to put under both eyes.  I use it morning and evening.  I have been using the product for about 2 years.</li>
    <li> The bottle did not match the picture.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does.  You can see a visible difference almost immediately.  Skin tone is brighter and dark circles disappear.  Have recommended this product to my friends who have had the same results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 250+ eye creams. This is the winner. It softens under-eye wrinkles, smooths crepe textured skin, and improves overall skin quality.  I&#x27;m quite generous with usage and end up covering a good four centimetres lower than the orbital socket. This cream has improved the pores in this area as well which was an unexpected bonus. Perfect for the over 40&#x27;s who have done a bit of sun-worshiping in their time.</li>
    <li> Love this product, I have used for years but paid a lot more for it at a salon, so when I found it on Amazon I was very happy.  It is one of the few you can actually use on your eye lids and it will not hurt it,and there is no burning, very soothing.</li>
    <li> I love trying lots of new products, but I always come back to the Neocutis eye cream - it&#x27;s wonderful.  I just received my most recent order and it was shipped very quickly and is just what I wanted.  In regard to the person who thought she didn&#x27;t get what she ordered: Neocutis has redesigned their packaging and this is the NEW packaging so you&#x27;re getting the newest product! :)</li>
    <li> this goes on smooth but a bit expensive</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream. It lightens and softens my under eyes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 years and they changed the ingredients. It no longer feels the same on my skin and has a unpleasant odor of chemicals (smells like rubber or toxic plastic). I am so disappointed. The last thing I want is a cream that smells like toxic plastic absorbing into my skin!!! I am never using this product again. I wish they would change it back.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist fully recommends this. I have been using it for several years and once I put it all over my eye I spread whatever is left on my cheeks.  Since then my cheeks are so soft.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old and have used Neocutis Lumiere Bio-restoration Eye Cream for about 5 years. I have had people ask&lt;br /&gt;why I don&#x27;t have deep lines or crows feet around my eyes. I give this product the credit.</li>
    <li> After going for a facial, the massage therapist suggested that I purchase Neocutis Eye Cream for the delicate area around my eyes.  I inquired as to the cost and was surprised to learn they were selling this product for ninty-five dollars.  I liked everything she told me about this cream so I did some research after getting home and found it through Amazon for fifty-eight dollars. I ordered it using the free shipping method and was pleased that it arrived so soon.  I use one small dot (about the size of a BB) for each eye both morning and night and must say I am very pleased with the results.  This small bottle lasts a good 2 months using the method I described.  I&#x27;m seventy-one years old and will continue to use this product as it&#x27;s the best that I have found.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is great.  It&#x27;s not greasy and absorbs quickly.  Doesn&#x27;t make your eye makeup crease.  Love the pump packaging that minimizes contamination (I hate those little jars that you have to dip your finger into) and is great for travelling (won&#x27;t lose product that gets pressurized while in your suitcase when flying).  It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, lightweight, product that shows proven results.  Pricey but worth it.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh your eye down. Covers easily with make-up.</li>
    <li> This is a gentle and effective eye cream.  Recently my skin has been very sensitive and this cream does it&#x27;s job without irritation</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a difference.  I bought this for darker circles and small lines, but I have not noticed any changes after use of 1 month.</li>
    <li> Not that great at all.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I bought this at a dermatologists office and that one worked fine.  I don&#x27;t know what happened with the products on the internet, but I&#x27;ve heard this complaint before.  Getting old is a bummer, but makeup helps a lot!</li>
    <li> I have no problem with my eyes.  I have nothing to complain about and I don&#x27;t know if it is pure luck, genes, age, or whatnot.  But since I&#x27;ve been using this for so long, maybe this takes a lil credit for the skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smooth.  I looked at the ingredients and it has everything the delicate skin around our eyes need.  It is on the pricey side but a lil goes a long way that I only have to buy a bottle once a year (and I apply this almost every night).  I&#x27;m loyal for life</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, at a good price and the delivery was rapid! This is not the first time I have ordered this cream and won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple of years and love it.</li>
    <li> I have used all sorts of eye creams, from very expensive to department store, and this one works the best!  My fine lines are disappearing, and I love how awake it makes me look.  Applying before makeup just helps the makeup go on smoother and I no longer have concealer creasing around my eyes.  Bought for Mom for her birthday!  Yay!</li>
    <li> i have very sensitive and have to be very careful with any new product.  so far so good with this product.  morning and night and lines seem almost gone. puffy is gone.  pretty good stuff.  had tried samples from Dr&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
    <li> The best eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> One of the best eye creams that packs a major punch when it comes to diminishing undereye dark circles and slight wrinkling.  It burns like crazy if it gets too close to your eyes, so use extra caution when applying.  The only thing that delivers similar (if not slightly superior) results is the La Mer eye concentrate.  Amazon prices on this gem of a product cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  Will continue to use it over the next few months. Has a nice texture to it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years!! Love, Love the product. my dermatologist turned me on to it. feels wonderful, and isn&#x27;t greasy? I have combination skin. I&#x27;m in my fifties and my skin looks great. I believe it helps. maybe not to take away wrinkles (which I don&#x27;t have) but to keep them away. Worth the money, try it and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I apply this eye cream nightly after cleansing.  It only takes a tiny drop for each eye which I message in the lid area and underneath the eye.  I really see a difference since I started using Neocutis Lumiere Bio Cream about 3 years ago and it has worked better at keeping the crows feet and darkness under control than anything I previously used.  I&#x27;m in my seventies and this is the best product I have found.  It&#x27;s quite a bit less expensive through Amazon than buying it from my message therapist.</li>
    <li> Really helps keep area around eyes looking less tired, more fresh. I am in my 60s, so many products don&#x27;t work so well. this does.</li>
    <li> For those of you who are pro life this product contains an ingredient by the name of Processed Skin Cell Proteins, or PSP which comes from medically donated aborted human fetuses. Meaning the cells are from human babies who have been essentially killed from their mother&#x27;s wombs with the consent of the mother and then processed to make beauty creams. Most of the line of this brand contains this ingredient, so if you are pro life or just find it creepy where the ingredient comes from I recommend you do not buy this product. If you are still skeptical about this review I invite you to take a moment of your time to investigate this on your own. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist.  I&#x27;m also using Neocutis facial moisturizers morning and night with pretty much the same ingredients.  This eye cream is supposed to have more PSP in it for concentrated effort on your crows feet.  My dermatologist likes it because she can read the contents and research on the products.  She says if ingredients and research is not fully disclosed, you could be completely wasting your money on a regular old moisturizer when you think you&#x27;re getting something special.</li>
    <li> Love it!  seller was fantastic too</li>
    <li> just a great product.  you can see the reduction in lines and the suppleness it provides to the under eye!</li>
    <li> Love the product, hate the new packaging. The pump on the new bottle doesn&#x27;t dispense properly; this is the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve gotten and it&#x27;s difficult to get the cream out. Also, I don&#x27;t understand why they can&#x27;t use recyclable plastic instead of this disposable junk.</li>
    <li> I just love the Neocutis eye cream.  It really works to give moisture to such a sensitive area.  I have been using the Neocutis products for some time now and they are the best!</li>
    <li> I love this product and use it always.  It truly helps sagging and wrinkling around the eye area.  A must buy for the mature woman.</li>
    <li> Another great product recommended by my skin doc.  You need very little but it soaks in and has softened the lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> A doctor recommended this and it seems like a good product but no dramatic difference. I&#x27;m not sure how to know if it is working.</li>
    <li> After a short time using this product very pleased with results, may switch to eye serum next time to compare results.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> This eye cream is the best of all that I have tried in the past.  It arrived on the promised date and packaged very well.  Thank You!</li>
    <li> use this product daily and really like it.  have reordered many times</li>
    <li> I really was unsure about this product at first, but I really see a difference after using it.  I love it.  My dark circles look a little lighter.  The price on amazon was much better than at the salon!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I can&#x27;t live without it,the skin around my eyes stays moist and wrinkle free all day long and I don&#x27;t have to keep applying it!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;Suzanne G</li>
    <li> I have dark circles under my eyes that I inherited from my mother. I used this eye cream for a few months, but saw no difference in my dark circles or my crows feet.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a beautician and I have been using for several years. It has a nice consistency that is not too oily, but keeps my eyes moisturized all day long. I really do like it.</li>
    <li> Love this product, it was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
