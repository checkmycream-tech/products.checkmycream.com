      <li>The leave Joico leave in detangler in  on my fine,</li>
      <li>I have frizzy, curly hairs, this product keeps my hair smooth even on humid days.</li>
      <li>This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used, I use it on my daughter and myself, it&#x27;s not to heavy, nothing else compares.</li>
      <li>Another plus is the light scent.  </li>
      <li>Detangler is often a necessity as (3) of us have thigh-length or better hair and textures that range from straight and fine to curly and mid-weight.  </li>
      <li>Great product for adding texture in wavy hair, for detangling hair from an up-do, and for softening dry ends.</li>
      <li>Suddenly I was inspired to look for it on Amazon and was delighted to find it.</li>
      <li>It dries quick, like just water.</li>
      <li>Although Joico has been known as a decent hair product for many years, it does not detangle hair.</li>
      <li>I was trying to use it as a leave-in conditioner and my hair was still super tangly even if I sprayed a lot.</li>
      <li>I am definitely buying this product again as it eliminates my having to purchase two different products and it worked perfectly for me.</li>
      <li>The same product purchased at my salon, but at a better price!  </li>
      <li>This has proven to be exactly what I needed!</li>
      <li>A very effective way for me (a dad) to brush my daughters hair without tears or crying.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent detangler, particularly if you have thick hair.</li>
      <li>I will most definitely purchase again and recommend it to family and friends!</li>
      <li>I always used conditioner, but my hairdresser advised me Joico Daily Leave-In-Detangler to have more body.  </li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair that tangles very easily.  </li>
      <li>and this adds body and makes my hair soft and full.</li>
      <li>Certainly made my hair \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t make it all that easier to comb through.</li>
      <li>If this was listed as a &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; item I would not complain, but it is certainly a lie that this was a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; item.</li>
      <li>you may like it as much as i do.</li>
      <li>(chlorination really tightens those knots).  </li>
      <li>This has really helped the condition of my hair because now I don&#x27;t have to go to war with my brush anymore.</li>
      <li>It does not leave residue or stiffness, but gently conditions and detangles hair.</li>
      <li>Very please with the product and the price, thank you amazon.</li>
      <li>only a light spay is needed.  </li>
      <li>Between the conditioners that we use, this product, and a good, wooden bristle brush, we get minimal breakage (if any).  </li>
      <li>I use this everyday for my own hair to help minimize breakage</li>
      <li>It is way better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is more confidence with this hair repair than other leave ins used before.</li>
      <li>I tried this because I have very curly hair and have tried to find their product &amp;#34;Integrity&amp;#34; this is decent yet nowhere close to the the quality of &amp;#34;Integrity&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product from a local pharmacy since I have super tangly hair.  </li>
      <li>Leave-In Detangler is used for my middle of the day fresh look.</li>
      <li>I purchased this based on the reviews and am very surprised at this product&#x27;s lack of performance.</li>
      <li>i use it every day and never tire of all the compliments on my soft hair!</li>
      <li>If you can get past the smell you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>I spray a small amount on damp hair and am able to comb right through my hair with a wide toothed comb.  </li>
      <li>It is weightless and leaves your hair feeling clean yet slightly conditioned.  </li>
      <li>In addition, the consistency of the liquid has a lot of separation (clearly water or another product was added to the bottle).</li>
      <li>Really adds life back to color processed hair!</li>
      <li>After trying more than a dozen products ranging from cheap to expensive, this is the only detangler that we currently use.  </li>
      <li>Daily Leave-In Detangler easily untangles it after I have washed it and makes my hair less likely to tangle throughout the day.</li>
      <li>Well, this detangles left my hair soft, manageable,and shinning.  </li>
      <li>I had been &amp;#34;nursing&amp;#34; a very old bottle of it that I&#x27;d gotten long ago at a beauty salon.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it especially for long hair.</li>
      <li>I have 2 young girls with long hair.  </li>
      <li>I needed something I could spray on and let dry without a sticky, wet, or oily look when dry after I came in from driving the convertible with the top down.</li>
      <li>The product dripped over all of my other items in the package, and now the bottle is only half full.</li>
      <li>I barely have to use any other products to keep it soft when it dries.</li>
      <li>It helps tame the frizzies especially if you blow dry your hair right after washing it and using the detangler.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great detangler for hair!</li>
    <li> Works great....love it. Lightweight....does not weigh hair down.... only a small amount needed.</li>
    <li> Great product for adding texture in wavy hair, for detangling hair from an up-do, and for softening dry ends. I also use it against the frizz (it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy, just weighs down the frizz) and as heat protection when styling. Recommendable.</li>
    <li> I always used conditioner, but my hairdresser advised me Joico Daily Leave-In-Detangler to have more body.  Well, this detangles left my hair soft, manageable,and shinning.  Very please with the product and the price, thank you amazon.</li>
    <li> Really adds life back to color processed hair! I wish it came in a gallon bottle!&lt;br /&gt;androgynous scent as well.</li>
    <li> Joico Daily Leave-In Detangler is used for my middle of the day fresh look. Not for everyone. Joico products are getting hard to find lately.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! Detangles quickly, smells great! I have very fine hair and this adds body and makes my hair soft and full.</li>
    <li> I have very long (down to my waist) straight hair. I recently got it colored to hide greys.  Since coloring my hair it is a tangled mess when washed/wet.  I don&#x27;t understand why... But anyway, I&#x27;ve been using the joico moisture shampoo and conditioner as well as this leave in detangler. My hair is still a tangled mess. I do like the smell though.</li>
    <li> I have been using Joico (Integrity) Daily Leave-in Detangler for over twenty years.  It is the best product I have found to combat tangled hair after shampooing.  I spray a small amount on damp hair and am able to comb right through my hair with a wide toothed comb.  It leaves hair silky with no residue.  I highly recommend it especially for long hair.</li>
    <li> It has changed names several times...why, I don&#x27;t know. It was called Integrity...and still is!</li>
    <li> Have been using for a while and love it</li>
    <li> After trying more than a dozen products ranging from cheap to expensive, this is the only detangler that we currently use.  Detangler is often a necessity as (3) of us have thigh-length or better hair and textures that range from straight and fine to curly and mid-weight.  We all agree that it works best if you wait 5 minutes after spraying before brushing (we tend to get more breakage with normal combs).  Between the conditioners that we use, this product, and a good, wooden bristle brush, we get minimal breakage (if any).  If we have been swimming, this product is not as helpful in removing the tangles (chlorination really tightens those knots).  In that case, we shampoo and use a heavy-duty hair mask as a conditioner and detangler.</li>
    <li> I tried this because I have very curly hair and have tried to find their product &amp;#34;Integrity&amp;#34; this is decent yet nowhere close to the the quality of &amp;#34;Integrity&amp;#34;. It will do until I find better or they bring back the great one.  I&#x27;m adding this on after trying it for a few weeks I won&#x27;t be using this again. Integrity users please join me in hounding them with emails until they bring it back</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!!! Tames the curls so I can comb out my hair. It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> Works well with the shampoo/conditioner combo (Moisture Recovery).  I have long thick hair, so a leave in detangler is necessary.  Try this...you may like it as much as i do.</li>
    <li> This detangler works great and it makes your hair so soft and smooth. It smells very good also which is a plus. I use this with a detangled brush and between the two I can brush through my very long hair in no time.</li>
    <li> Nice product. I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything for me. I was trying to use it as a leave-in conditioner and my hair was still super tangly even if I sprayed a lot. Bummer!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair that tangles very easily.  Joico Daily Leave-In Detangler easily untangles it after I have washed it and makes my hair less likely to tangle throughout the day.</li>
    <li> This is the only leave in conditioner I have used for years. Works great. Not greasy or over-powering. Love it.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS DAILY IN THE MORNINGS ON MY HAIR BEFORE BLOW&lt;br /&gt;DRYING IT.  I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS AND IT&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT.  NO BUILD UP.</li>
    <li> The same product purchased at my salon, but at a better price!  I will most definitely purchase again and recommend it to family and friends!</li>
    <li> This detangled is awesome on my hair. I barely have to use any other products to keep it soft when it dries.</li>
    <li> I show world-class cats and this was recommended to me for grooming them.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is weightless and leaves your hair feeling clean yet slightly conditioned.  It helps tame the frizzies especially if you blow dry your hair right after washing it and using the detangler.  There is no need to rinse it out and only a light spay is needed.  Since I have oily hair this is the only conditioner I can use.  Hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> nice price quick shipping</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the reviews and am very surprised at this product&#x27;s lack of performance.</li>
    <li> Best Stuff ever, I have been using this for years and would not use any other kind.</li>
    <li> Smells great and detangles hair.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years for a after wash conditioner and it works great.  It conditions &amp; detangles Great!</li>
    <li> The leave Joico leave in detangler in  on my fine, curly, breaking colored hair and it becomes stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I dampen my hair and use a bit in the place most damaged every day.&lt;br /&gt;There is more confidence with this hair repair than other leave ins used before.Also it keeps the shine better than others.&lt;br /&gt;I also use Joico Revitalux every time I wash my hair (every 5 days).Using a bit more in the  the problem area, with heat for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> I have 2 young girls with long hair.  After their hair is washed, conditioned and towel dryed, I spray in the leave-in detangler.  It works amazingly well.  It is way better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried. Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent detangler, particularly if you have thick hair. It allows me to comb through my hair without breaking it.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday for my own hair to help minimize breakage</li>
    <li> The product had a sun faded, yellow plastic cap around the spray nozzle. Could be water in the bottle for all I know. Didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in my hair at all.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST leave in conditioner. I have been using it for 20 years. I started using this on my daughter on her long hair when she was 3. I bought this one for her as she still uses it at 23.</li>
    <li> The one star review has no relation to the actual product, as I have yet to try it. It arrived without a cap, and covered poorly with saran wrap. The product dripped over all of my other items in the package, and now the bottle is only half full. In addition, the consistency of the liquid has a lot of separation (clearly water or another product was added to the bottle). If this was listed as a &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; item I would not complain, but it is certainly a lie that this was a &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; item.</li>
    <li> Was expecting better for the price, will probably not purchase again. Certainly made my hair \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; but didn&#x27;t make it all that easier to comb through.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! I have frizzy, curly hairs, this product keeps my hair smooth even on humid days.</li>
    <li> This is not only a detangler but a thermal protectant.  I needed something I could spray on and let dry without a sticky, wet, or oily look when dry after I came in from driving the convertible with the top down. I usually just take it with me to use when I stop if my hair has escaped and tangled. It dries quick, like just water. I also needed something I could use on my hair before blow drying to protect against the heat of the dryer.  This has proven to be exactly what I needed! I use it in the morning after washing or rinsing my hair, and I can use it later after driving, and I don&#x27;t have a mess built up in my hair. Another plus is the light scent.  I cannot tolerate strong-smelling personal care items as I have allergies and am susceptible to migraines.  This does not aggravate either problem.  I am definitely buying this product again as it eliminates my having to purchase two different products and it worked perfectly for me.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I had been &amp;#34;nursing&amp;#34; a very old bottle of it that I&#x27;d gotten long ago at a beauty salon. Suddenly I was inspired to look for it on Amazon and was delighted to find it. While the bottle shape and size may have changed, the quality of the product and its ability to nourish and condition my hair are the same. I am so happy to have found it again. It does not leave residue or stiffness, but gently conditions and detangles hair.</li>
    <li> Although Joico has been known as a decent hair product for many years, it does not detangle hair. At all. It actually made my hair snap and that&#x27;s not good. Also, not much of a conditioner. Worthless product.</li>
    <li> Love this product but the sprayer stopped working and doesn&#x27;t pump.</li>
    <li> A very effective way for me (a dad) to brush my daughters hair without tears or crying.  It provides a nice lubricant so I can brush out tangles while keeping their hair healthy and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I bought this product because, I removed my individual braids and I needed as little hair breakage from detangling as possible. The only this I do not like is the smell. If you can get past the smell you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from a local pharmacy since I have super tangly hair.  Well, it might as well be bottled water.  Didn&#x27;t detangle my hair in the slightest.  I guess I&#x27;ll see if I can find another detangler.  Hoping Amazon discussion board can make suggestions?</li>
    <li> I love this leave in conditioner i use it every day and never tire of all the compliments on my soft hair! Can not beat the price of all joico products on amazon either. at least 50% of my salon!</li>
    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used, I use it on my daughter and myself, it&#x27;s not to heavy, nothing else compares.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! My hair is a bleached, tangly mess after showers. This has really helped the condition of my hair because now I don&#x27;t have to go to war with my brush anymore. Wait for your hair to dry before brushing it! It also smells nice. will definitely repurchase this when I run out.</li>
