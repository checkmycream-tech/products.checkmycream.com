      <li>I love it single packed and good price</li>
      <li>and then I got one super huge one</li>
      <li>When I opened it, it made me nervous because it was a plastic ziploc bag full of what appeared to be unwrapped lozenges with the letter &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; on them.</li>

      <li>I don&#x27;t know why skin care often neglects this area of the face; I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only person with this problem (</li>

      <li>The package I received clearly marked 50, so I counted it and it&#x27;s exactly 50 pieces!</li>
      <li>I wondered if perhaps chemicals from the manufacturing process were responsible.  </li>
      <li>I also received it fast especial since it came from Japan.</li>
      <li>Item sold as described and fast shipping</li>
      <li>It arrives really fast.</li>
      <li>These paper masks really help with the absorption of toners, moisturizers and liquid or cream face masks.</li>
      <li>It is pretty cool to see it expand (it is about the size of a lifesaver candy prior to wetting).  </li>
      <li>I find this somewhat unhygienic and while I will continue to use the remainder of the product, unless I am sure future purchases will be properly packaged, I will not be making any repurchases.</li>
      <li>decent.</li>
      <li>I got about 96 normal sized one (about the size of a dime)</li>
      <li>The thing is, I have super sensitive skin, and it was definitely tingling after 15 minutes of use with a honey mask.</li>
      <li>These came with hanging eye hole covers, not at all clean like the photo - cut those off after you wet the mask, but before you apply your lotion.</li>
      <li>I linked a picture below, the package marked 50 pieces!    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with them, they are so simple to use, and I have been looking for a long time for a simple way to accomplish those goals.</li>
      <li>Product is just like 100 white pills in a cheap old zip lock bag without instruction,not like pictured each mask has single package.  </li>
      <li>I had no idea they were little tablets that expand in liquid to fit your face.</li>
      <li>They came in a package with the customs section marked &amp;#34;gift - wristwatch&amp;#34; so I had no clue what I was getting, because I didn&#x27;t order a watch.</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised when I received these.</li>
      <li>so it could be that my skin is just too sensitive to these.</li>
      <li>I tried one mask,quality just ok,but  the mask is too small,can not cover my  forehead and nose completely.</li>
      <li>I really do like these, but I received the pods in some sketchy zip lock bag, unlike the image displayed of the masks being individually sealed.</li>
      <li>not amazing one, just OK</li>
      <li>Far too small for most adults to use as it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire face.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, they will eventually flop down over your eyes or you&#x27;ll have to stick them out of the way with extra lotion, which is a waste of good</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used a couple with toner</li>
      <li>My mouth is almost 2.5 inches wide from corner to corner; pretty normal to small.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use these a few times weekly to follow The Japanese skincare Revolution book. Works great</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll use this with all my masques, but for some, especially those that cost a lot and call for a thick layer...this is perfect.  And, I can make my own where I know what the ingrediants are.  Maybe some hyluronic acid gel, manuka honey and a touch of apple cider vinegar.  This will keep things from drying out.  So far I&#x27;ve used it with enzymatic masks like pumpkin, that worked great.</li>
    <li> Very convenient and easy use</li>
    <li> I found that these irritated my face.  I wondered if perhaps chemicals from the manufacturing process were responsible.  I quit using them after about the third time.  I see others like them, so it could be that my skin is just too sensitive to these.</li>
    <li> Worthless. No matter how creative I get with these things, they aren&#x27;t worth the effort or time.</li>
    <li> These are just great!! Super cheap!!! I pay this much for one pre made paper mask!! So great price. So easy to use and just all around awesome.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. Used once, and many tiny fibers were on my face. Feel terrible. Poor quality.</li>
    <li> I have had these for YEARS! I use them all the time! I love making my own face masks! I also have given these out as girts in goodie bags, they make the perfect gift!</li>
    <li> This product is terrible. This product is made from cheap chemical compressed papers. It is made in China and shipped from China (#202 Xin Qui Wang Office building, Chemical Industry Road, Chaoyang district, Beijing, China). The package cover is not the same as the one shown on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller, So Beauty, did not disclose these facts. I would never buy any beauty products made in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would request Amazon to remove So Beauty company from Amazon website. They are not honest.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: this is my first ever bad review to any product I bought from Amazon. I was in shock when opened the package.</li>
    <li> Item sold as described and fast shipping</li>
    <li> The package I received clearly marked 50, so I counted it and it&#x27;s exactly 50 pieces! What a rip off, I bought it cause obviously for the 100pcs and well how did I ended up with 50? Just unbelievable! I&#x27;ve read other reviews that it&#x27;s not exactly 100, sometimes it&#x27;s 96 or 94 or whatever so I didn&#x27;t mind but 50?!!! that is just unacceptable! I linked a picture below, the package marked 50 pieces!    [...]    [IMG][...][/IMG]</li>
    <li> I did the authenticity check following the instructions printed on the package, and I found out this product is counterfeit. I totally not recommend it to anyone. And since this one is a mask, supposed to put on face, I cannot use it or get it returned/refunded.</li>
    <li> It arrives really fast. This mask takes a lot of liquid to expand so i may have to expand it with water first before i pour in my toner.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised when I received these. I had no idea they were little tablets that expand in liquid to fit your face. I&#x27;m amazed, I think they are one of the best little invention I have ever seen. Not only are they great for DIY masks, they are also wonderful for sealing in hydraulonic acid. I&#x27;m in love with them, they are so simple to use, and I have been looking for a long time for a simple way to accomplish those goals. I am a big Amazon shopper and this is the first review I&#x27;ve written, I have bought a lot of excellent products, but this is the first time I said &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;  Just ordered some more!</li>
    <li> good and cheap, arrived here so quickly</li>
    <li> Love it! It pampers my face at night.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling, now I take great care of my skin even away from home with custom masks I make myself.</li>
    <li> These look nothing like the picture. They came in a package with the customs section marked &amp;#34;gift - wristwatch&amp;#34; so I had no clue what I was getting, because I didn&#x27;t order a watch. When I opened it, it made me nervous because it was a plastic ziploc bag full of what appeared to be unwrapped lozenges with the letter &amp;#34;S&amp;#34; on them. It was only after verifying the address with the one on my order list that I realized they were my masks. Unsanitary and dishonest. I&#x27;ll be reporting the falsified customs form to Amazon.</li>
    <li> i love watching it expand when something liquid touches it. still, i think it doesnt absorb everything well because its so thin.</li>
    <li> Shipping: It took quite some time, around a month, for it to be delivered. On the plus side, it was free shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product: Was a bit confused when I opened the package. They look like tablets, but they transform into face masks after thrown into water! Very cool to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: Very easy to use with homemade facial masks.</li>
    <li> They sell masks like these at the local Face Shop that are already soaked in product for about $2 each. These paper masks really help with the absorption of toners, moisturizers and liquid or cream face masks. I actually sat down and counted the masks in this pack because I was super bored. I got about 96 normal sized one (about the size of a dime) and then I got one super huge one and I have no idea what it is. You don&#x27;t need a lot of product to hydrate these mask, as soon as they get wet they like explode to full size. So far, I&#x27;ve only used a couple with toner but they&#x27;re great and I&#x27;ll order them again. If you follow the typical &amp;#34;Korean&amp;#34; skin care routine of two face masks a week they&#x27;ll last you a whole year for $5 which is an amazing value, especially if you make your own cream or vitamin masks to avoid chemicals.</li>
    <li> I started using these for lotion masks and although they work nicely, the only drawbacks for me are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The mask is a bit small for my face, so it doesn&#x27;t go all the way back to my ears. I don&#x27;t have a big face at all, just a round one, yet it misses about an inch on each side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The eye and mouth holes are a little closer together and in general small for my eyes and mouth; the holes are circles, not ovals. To give you an idea, I have an African nose with a slight bridge and almost 1.5 inches width from nostril to nostril, so it&#x27;s not like my nose is pulling  the mask up and away from my face. My mouth is almost 2.5 inches wide from corner to corner; pretty normal to small. The mask sits on the outer edges of my eyes and mouth even after I give it a few good tugs; not the worst thing in the world, but I wish it fit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The mask does not cover all the way under my chin to my neck, which is problematic for me as this is an area of my face in need of extra TLC. I&#x27;ll have to supplement with cotton skin care pads to cover that area of my face. I don&#x27;t know why skin care often neglects this area of the face; I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not the only person with this problem (even when I used to go for facials regularly, I had to stay on the Aesthetician about tending to this area).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) These came with hanging eye hole covers, not at all clean like the photo - cut those off after you wet the mask, but before you apply your lotion. Otherwise, they will eventually flop down over your eyes or you&#x27;ll have to stick them out of the way with extra lotion, which is a waste of good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these masks because the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and I&#x27;m not bothered enough by them to stop using the product. In spite of the minor inconveniences I&#x27;ve listed, I recommend this product for at-home beauty masks.</li>
    <li> good. however, it is more expensive than in China. it is too thin.</li>
    <li> very poor quality. becomes dry after only five minutes on my face.</li>
    <li> I was totally disappointed after it took almost whole month to received it.  The facial mask is like a piece of toilet paper on your face, completely dry.  I will never order this!</li>
    <li> I love it single packed and good price</li>
    <li> This is the best mask for busy people. I can even have facials when I travel with ease.</li>
    <li> I love using face sheet masks, but the cost can really add up. When I found these DIY facial mask pods, I was ecstatic at the chance to save some money. These were super affordable and paired with some household or beauty items I had on hand, I could create my own face treatments. I would soak these pods with rose water, honey, or diluted essential oils and chill them in the fridge before using them to cool down on a hot day. I really do like these, but I received the pods in some sketchy zip lock bag, unlike the image displayed of the masks being individually sealed. I find this somewhat unhygienic and while I will continue to use the remainder of the product, unless I am sure future purchases will be properly packaged, I will not be making any repurchases.</li>
    <li> These are great small/tiny facial paper compress mask.  These are really tiny but when you place them with a toner and watch it expand to the size of your face. I love these mask, like everyone else I place it with my favorite toner and place it on my face. Unwrap it carefully because it is a thin paper like mask but, it does the job. I also received it fast especial since it came from Japan. I will be ordering a lot more of these mask.</li>
    <li> This item is very useful and their service is amazing. Thank you.</li>
    <li> feels like there is some chemical in the masks... I mean, I suppose there must be, in order to keep them shrunk and compact like they are. The thing is, I have super sensitive skin, and it was definitely tingling after 15 minutes of use with a honey mask. My goal was to use these so I can leave the honey mask overnight without staining my pillow, but I ended up taking the mask off after those 15 minutes. It works fine, but probably best to proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin like mine.</li>
    <li> Nifty little product. I&#x27;ve  been doing a toner/lotion mask and this makes it super easy to do. I used to cut up cotton pads to fit my face , but with this all I have to do is add the toner and water, and put  it on my face</li>
    <li> not amazing one, just OK</li>
    <li> When I got this item, I was very disappointed ,the item is not as pictured on Amazon. Product is just like 100 white pills in a cheap old zip lock bag without instruction,not like pictured each mask has single package.  I tried one mask,quality just ok,but  the mask is too small,can not cover my  forehead and nose completely.I would not recomment it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is great! I love it!</li>
    <li> Like a papertowel in the shape of your face. decent.</li>
    <li> I just got 90 pcs in the bag.</li>
    <li> Worked great with my facial products!</li>
    <li> What a waste&lt;br /&gt;After waiting  weeks for the product, the masks were such a disappointment. Far too small for most adults to use as it doesn&#x27;t cover the entire face. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> My order came in a Ziploc type bag with no info on what to do. I snipped the plastic wrapper and ran some water over it in my palm.  It is pretty cool to see it expand (it is about the size of a lifesaver candy prior to wetting).  The downside is it is very small.  I buy tons of masks and thought it would be cool to make my own. This mask just has to be the smallest mask I&#x27;ve ever seen.  The eyes/nose/mouth holes are so clise together it&#x27;s hard for it to make contact around your eyes if you don&#x27;t want your mouth covered with the mask.  I use enough masks to know this one is just about 2&amp;#34; shorter than a standard mask.  I&#x27;ll probably use these pellets but won&#x27;t reorder.  It&#x27;s a shame it is not longer.</li>
    <li> Love it, very easy to us, the quality is good,</li>
    <li> Received the product two weeks after I ordered.  The masks are individually warped and are of good quality.  They even included a sample for another product and some. Very pleased!</li>
