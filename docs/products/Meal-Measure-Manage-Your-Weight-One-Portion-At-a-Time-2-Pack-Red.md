<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> very helpful i would buy the product again</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re really serious about your portions this will help you get started.</li>
    <li> I find this to be an excellent tool. Works great and much more affordable than buying all new plates. Also much more practical than some other tools available.</li>
    <li> An excellent tool to use in my high school nutrition classes.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted.  good quality, simple.</li>
    <li> Bought it months ago, but still haven&#x27;t used it.  Honestly, it&#x27;s a good invention and would be great for someone who really wants to  regulate their food.  Overall, the rule of using a smaller plate and not let anything touch works better for me.</li>
    <li> ackward looking didn&#x27;t understand it&lt;br /&gt;returned it ridculous&lt;br /&gt;only typing more because they want more waords, don&#x27;t have anyting to say</li>
    <li> So Helpful&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S EASIER TO JUST DISH THE FOOD OUT.</li>
    <li> Use this religiously to measure my food.. I bought one for my girlfriend.. It helps us keep our food intake in check.. Good buy!!</li>
    <li> Very helpful to me since one of my problems is portion control.  Happy that I ordered it.</li>
    <li> Really brings to the forefront what a  &amp;#34;portion&amp;#34; actually is!</li>
    <li> Deciding to eat better because I am pre diabetic. I have trouble with portion control. This will help me out...Thanks.</li>
    <li> This great for getting the whole family to portion their meals. We can all work together on losing weight and eating healthier with these plate meal measurements.  I like that I can measure less than my husband, but still use the samething,  rather than having out my measuring cups all the time.</li>
    <li> Gave to family members, they loved them</li>
    <li> This is very simple to use and has helped in my weight management system.</li>
    <li> Not a happy camper today. I chose this item for the higher $$ amount as it read, &amp;#34;2 pack&amp;#34;. When I got the Meal Measure, even the packaging read &amp;#34;2 pack&amp;#34; but there was only one. Need to know if I misunderstood as I wanted to give one to my daughter.</li>
    <li> No more questions about portion sizes - just use this easy portion control device and you&#x27;ll be good to go. Works well for slightly moist items, not as well for liquids (use a measuring cup!). I like it for measuring salad portions (veggies in each cup) and for measuring dry items like cereal. I use it almost daily - nice to have it around.</li>
    <li> Makes portion control easy!</li>
    <li> I like the size of this product.  It makes measuring out my portion so easy.  The material is durable.</li>
    <li> Really like this there is absolutely no guessing.</li>
    <li> Great product to help you with portion control, and to lose weight.</li>
    <li> I am always trying to be conscientous about my weight and portions and I was looking for an easier alternative to portion control and this is just the product! I am very weird about my food touching, so instead of using one cup to measure out my food and having to clean it out when I am measuring out another food item, this product has been used to save my life and sanity!! The meal measure is deeper than you would expect and it is very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Very convenient! Great quality!</li>
    <li> I have looked for this forever. I am always relying on amazon to get the things I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this because you can put this down on a plate and show, physically, what a serving of meat/veggie look like as the portion sizes in this country have become super-sized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone who teaches nutrition.</li>
    <li> I have only had for about a week. So far I like it. It is easy to use and it helps a lot.</li>
    <li> Just what I was expecting, does the job it is supposed.</li>
    <li> Love them can&#x27;t wait to use them</li>
    <li> This works great.  Ordering more for some of my family members who are on diets.  Helps you cut back on your servings.</li>
    <li> Too clunky, donated to Goodwill.  Not easy to navigate with food.</li>
    <li> Very easy and visual to help with portion control. Very thick plastic and not flimsy.</li>
    <li> The Meal Messure,  arrived just when Amazon promised, looks exactly like the advertisement and best of all The Meal Measure was just what I needed to avoid over eating and begin to maintain a healthy eating habit. Thank you</li>
    <li> Easy to use just 1/2 cup to measure.</li>
    <li> This was on my wish list and bought this by accident. It&#x27;s an ok device from what I saw. I find it easier to grab a measuring cup and measure out my serving size. This could work for some people, just not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality seemed nice and durable.</li>
    <li> Wow, how this shows you what a real portion size should be .&lt;br /&gt;Quantity of 2 came in it.  Easy to use.  What an eye opener into&lt;br /&gt;how much we overeat.</li>
    <li> I actually have not used it yet  but it is bigger than I had thought so I am sure I will feel satisfied while counting my Weight Watcher points.</li>
    <li> I like this. The concept is good. Good quality plastic. I just don&#x27;t seem to pull it out of the cabinet that often to actually put it to good use.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife but she has not used it.  I tried it, as I thought it would take away the weighing of food thing and help maintain a smaller amount of food, but found that it was a lot of effort and additional work and did not give me the results I often wanted with weighing food.  For those that just want to watch their portions this can be a good toll though.</li>
    <li> Great tool for portion control.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use and great tool!!! Brought one for myself and my mother.  We are both diabetic so it makes portion control a very easy task!</li>
    <li> Got these and they take a while to get used too.  I ended up finding that I could guess the right amount before placing it into this.  So I wasn&#x27;t that far off.  And its a little hard when its items that don&#x27;t fit into the circles good.</li>
    <li> worthless, I tried using them &amp; fail.  These are tall, which makes it awkward to put food in the holes.  Don&#x27;t bother - use a measuring cup &amp; save your money</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money and time. The only markings are for I/2 cup measure and it is hard to see that. You are better off to just use measuring cups! I wanted to return them, but received no paper work in the mailing so I was out the 20.00 plus shipping!</li>
    <li> They are ok.  They don&#x27;t work for everything you eat and I find I am not using them as often as I should.  How would you measure lasagna or French fries?  I guess the idea is not to eat that stuff but a good diet lets you eat real, regular food, just in smaller portions.  Anyway, it helps just not with everything.</li>
    <li> We gave these to participants of a health and wellness project. They were very excited to receive items that helped them to manage eating habits. These are very easy to use and helpful to keep track of portion size.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on a whim, thinking I would go on a diet. It works perfectly if you have will power, and can stick to the plan. I just now started using it, and you realize really quickly how much you over eat without noticing.</li>
    <li> I had questions about the product being BPA-free and recyclable and the contact person at Meal Measure responded almost immediately.  Happy to say it is BPA-free, recyclable, AND made in the United States.  Some said they could do as well with measuring cups, but then why aren&#x27;t they already doing that?  Obviously we can all measure our food in various ways.  Most people have measuring utensils, many of us already know about picturing a deck of cards, our fists, a golf ball, and other visuals to judge how much meat,  vegetables, cheese, and other food we should have on our plates, but for one reason or another this doesn&#x27;t work for us (otherwise why are we even looking at devices like the Meal Measure?).  I like that it&#x27;s quick and easy.  Using the food pyramid guidelines or some other dietary source we can put a plate of food together in a jif.  It&#x27;s a great way to manage your portions.  Now if I can just keep from filling it a second time.</li>
    <li> My husband and I really like them. we both want to loose weight and I think if we use these all the time  it will help keep the portions the right size.</li>
    <li> Got it and when opened it it had a slight broken section.</li>
    <li> I bought these by accident, but I am glad I did. The plates make it very easy to eat the right amount of each food group.</li>
    <li> We have a tough time watching our weight - mostly due to portion control. So when we saw these portion control devices, we were excited to think that this might be an easy way to cut down on our eating.  Well, we used them once.  The problem is they don&#x27;t sit flat on your plate unless you use a really large plate.  So I don&#x27;t know how accurate they are.  And we&#x27;ve gone to using smaller plates with effectively makes you eat less because there&#x27;s less room on the plate.  So, in my opinion, this was a waste of money.  Just use a measuring cup.</li>
    <li> Its good to control portions and getting a balance diet but now i just eat off a small dessert plate</li>
    <li> My clients low these to help with portion sizes</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price</li>
    <li> The Meal Measure Manage Your Weight portion control plate divider really makes it easy to measure out your food so you do not over eat. You will find individual areas that hold a fruit, vegetable, protein and starch. The three round portion areas have a half cup line and if you fill the round area to the top it measures 1 cup. The half circle area neatly measures out how much protein you should be eating during your meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You place the Meal Measure on top of your dinner plate and fill each area with the amount of food you choose to eat. You then remove the Meal Measure and you are ready-to-eat a perfectly portioned meal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a snap as you can toss the Meal Measure in the dishwasher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
    <li> just what i need to get me on track .great seller</li>
    <li> Its is what you see. Nothing more and nothing less.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be flatter to bulky sits on  plate put  food in holes would  have  liked  it better  I think  if it were maybe  half  as tall</li>
    <li> I really like the new Meal Measure.You just place the Meal Measure on your plate and serve the portions. It has three open cavities which represent a cup if full and 1/2 cup if half full. The cavities are for vegetables, fruit or starch. The open end represents protein for easy measurement. I belong to TOPS and order the two pack so that I could share with a TOPS member.  It is very easy to use and dishwasher safe.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It really helps me with my portion control.  I did weight watchers and all the other diets but this really reminds me not to over eat. :)  This is a must by it is perfect for plate.</li>
    <li> So much easier to help change the problems of eatting the correct portions.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine if you have 3 separate items on your menu, but for other items, such as sandwiches, burgers ect., not so much</li>
    <li> Excellent! Anyone who is diabetic (type 1 or 2 ) should have multiples of this product. It makes creating a healthy diabetic meal a snap. I will be purchasing more.</li>
    <li> Just received my meal measure.  I think the portions sizes are still too much if you are trying to eat sensible.  The portion control apparatus is bigger in person.</li>
    <li> I thought this portion control meal measure would be easy to use but I find it is limited in what I can measure with it. For example, I cannot measure tacos or hamburgers, or sandwiches. It is limited. It is helpful with some meals but I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> but I found it totally useless in terms of portion control.  I think that there must be better options available in the marketplace.</li>
    <li> Definitely helps with portion control!</li>
    <li> I saw this on pinterest and thought I needed it..turns out I don&#x27;t. I have used it a couple times but find I use my food scale more. So basically if you have a food scale, save your money and use that..</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations and was as advertised and it did arrive promptly. I would order from them again. This product makes portioning your meals quick and easy</li>
    <li> I have never used it. It seems like a good idea, but not.  Trying to find another use. Easier just to eyeball it</li>
    <li> I chose this item to control my portions.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery. I liked it so much I bought&lt;br /&gt;my daughter one after her baby was born.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as shown</li>
    <li> This is GREAT but once I took away rice, potatoes, pasta, etc... I started losing more weight!  I now weigh out 4-6oz of meat/fish and 1 cup of veggies every meal and I am now losing.</li>
    <li> I saw these in the hospital and in doctor offices to show patience what sizes look like.  The dummies would not sell me one.  I didn&#x27;t see that as positive.  So when I saw this on amazon -  I grabbed one for me and a friend because I know people start asking questions when you hit about 15  pounds.  I&#x27;ve lost over 80 pounds on Atkins over the years. But Im much older now and want to eat more fruits to build up my body so this looked good.  I eat a measure and at the end of the month Im eating alot more healthy food than I ever did.  I juice every morning and meals the other two and the weight is dropping off quick but I don&#x27;t eat bread or sodas period and very little sugar now.  I don&#x27;t haave diabetes and don&#x27;t want to get it.  Im almost 60 but it runs in my family.  So far this time 16 pounds in three weeks.  Im happy.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much its the only one&lt;br /&gt;that helped with control on the plate with portion control&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for help with portion control Its Great,</li>
    <li> i returned it take it off</li>
    <li> Just in time for Thanksgiving. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> Nobody eats those tiny portions.... too small for anyone... including a child...</li>
    <li> These help with portion control - especially to show you that &amp;#34;eye balling it&amp;#34; gives you much more than you realize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what size plate they use in the picture, but the meal measures are actually quite big and bulky. That&#x27;s not an issue when it comes to using it, just good to know for storage.</li>
    <li> Seeing what normal portion control looks like is not fun but it is enlightening.  Now I just have to actually USE the thing!</li>
    <li> Great idea for someone that has bigger eyes than their stomach!  Easy to use. Only negative would be the storage space required.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t that it is a bad product, Just big and bulky and really not necessary to have when I got it.  Use your measuring cups and save the cupboard space.</li>
    <li> This shipped very quickly and is really helpful in teaching you how much you should eat.  I was just surprised at how big it was!</li>
    <li> So this is a great idea and I bought it thinking I would use it a lot.... but I don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s very thick and difficult to store</li>
    <li> This was by far the best thing for people who need to eat right.I love it l bought one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> there were no instructions at all. Do I fill the portions all the way or half way? It is just sent all by it&#x27;s lonesome. Not even a few recipes or anything. Feeling a little ripped off.</li>
    <li> since axel is my dog I guess he loved it . for me it&#x27;s a good product just something we forget to get out and use</li>
    <li> perfect for portion control.</li>
    <li> What was I thinking?  I did not need this.</li>
    <li> its physically a great product, but i realized I wont use it. Going to return.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used yet, but is exactly what I was looking for.  Will be trying out the new portion control dish this week. Holidays are over!</li>
    <li> This is a nuisance.  Not worth it.</li>
    <li> I guess if you are clueless about portion control..it is a good item..</li>
    <li> I really love this portion plate, it works well.</li>
    <li> Looked like a good idea but I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  Not very inclined to use.  Also, I didn&#x27;t know there were two in one package so I ordered two.&lt;br /&gt;Gave one away and might do the same with the other.</li>
    <li> My daughter has loved using this. It&#x27;s a great way to show older kids how to have a balanced meal.</li>
    <li> This portion control plate is exactly what I needed to get my portions correct.  It came very quickly and is sturdy and very effective for portion control.</li>
    <li> Truly a smart helper.  You&#x27;ll be surprised to see how much less you will be dishing out.  Set back and wait a while before you think you need to go for seconds.</li>
    <li> I thought this is a unique product and it worked as advertised. I also bought one for my daughter as well.</li>
    <li> great must if you are trying to control portions</li>
    <li> Seems like it will help.  Now all we have to do is use it!!</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPING. EXCATLY AS DESCRIBED.</li>
    <li> Love them, they were just as seller described, they were on time. These are great in helping lose weight and keep on track with eating healthy.</li>
    <li> Interesting concept, it really helps, provided you are eating at home.</li>
    <li> This meal measure is an excellent buy for someone wishing to taking out the guessing out of dieting. It is sensible to keep it handy. By using this meal measure, I am able to stick with the correct portions. I have been losing 2 lbs a week.</li>
    <li> this is a&lt;br /&gt; great way to use portion control. It was recommended by a friend and I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> looking for ways to help control over eating.  I usually pack my lunch for the week so I don&#x27;t have to bring my lunch bag home each night and wanting something to help me with eating more fruits &amp; veggies and not overstuffung my plate.  I am hypoglycemic and needed help with getting the recommened fruits &amp; veggies to help my sugar levels.  So far so good...</li>
    <li> This thing is ok if you eat like this, but most of us don&#x27;t.  For the times that I do it makes it simple to know how much you should be eating. It is very sturdy and I like that it has 1/2 cup markings or cup markings to the top.  Mostly is use measured serving spoons or weight for more accurate results, but this is also good and quick.</li>
    <li> I had this item returned. Frankly i could barely see the measurement marks. I like the idea but decided that the item was also too bulky and it was just not worth the place it would take it to store. I ordered 2 of them because if u have only one u have to immediately washed it after use , I wanted a spare to use it while the other was  in the dishwasher.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It does not give you any other choice for measurements other than 1/2 a cup or a whole cup for everything. Too basic. Did not like it.</li>
    <li> the Meal Measure is not bad and works to its specification......the only thing I would change is to make the labels much clear</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great mi use it for every meal. Easy to clean and easy to use. I absolutely love my meal measure!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this for anyone needing a measuring method for a complete meal.</li>
    <li> There is not too much to these, but it was a good price for two and it really helps me because I am carb cycling, so on my high carb days it ensures I watch my portion sizes.  Now the really chore will be getting my hubby to use the other one... But I say it was worth it.</li>
    <li> Liked it, a little bigger than I thought but over all found it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Only negative for me was I ordered two of them (this was sold in a two pack combo).  They do not stack into each other so they do take up space but other wise I like it.</li>
    <li> This was a waste of money and time!  These plates are still underneath my cabinet. All you have to do is don&#x27;t fill your plate pass the dip in the plate/rim</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to determine how much you can really serve of each item.  I don&#x27;t recommended</li>
    <li> I gave this rating because the product was received before the promised date, in perfect order &amp; it does what it claimed to do.  It is very easy to use &amp; helps me to measure out the correct amount I need.</li>
    <li> Everything it says it was, good quality, great shipping.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> It gives me an idea on how much to eat. Train my self also I use it with my husband too :)</li>
    <li> These are wonderful aides for my son to learn healthier eating. I gave this 4 stars because my son is still having to use the scale to weight his meat.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and quick shipment.  If you are trying to do portion control then this is perfect for you!</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s great, I have found.d this product to help me control how much I&#x27;m eating. Believe it or not it really does work.</li>
    <li> We are always struggling to measure and this makes it so simple. Both my husband and I use one. Actually it&#x27;s a good portion without the guessing.</li>
    <li> A great way to limit your caloric intake! It gives you the option of between 1/2 cup and 1 cup servings! Great transaction with this seller!</li>
    <li> Everyone knows what my new year resolution is....DIET. This is a clever idea and hopefully will help me in portion control. Product was delivered in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Works great, easy to clean, and I am easily eating less....imagine that and so easy too.  I liked having two so one could always be clean</li>
    <li> Comes in handy when you are trying to cut back.</li>
    <li> This is sufficient and sturdy for its needs. It has directions on the ring with measurements. This should prove to make things simpler for portion control.</li>
    <li> bought it for myself and a friend who was going to diet and eat right with me, not sure about her but I never used it. I guess it is accurate for your proportions though and would work, I&#x27;ve just decided to weigh and measure everything rather than use this..if one really wanted to, packing food into those little spaces,, one could still over eat. Weighing and measuring is working for me.</li>
    <li> It works as it should super easy to us.  It has labels on the top.</li>
