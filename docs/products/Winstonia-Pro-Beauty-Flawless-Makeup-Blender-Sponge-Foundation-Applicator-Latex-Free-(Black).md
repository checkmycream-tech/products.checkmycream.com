      <li>My concealer never looked better!</li>
      <li>Blends my countours just so amazingly, I look like KIM K.</li>
      <li>Nice shipped to its destination.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are great, reusable makeup blenders that in my opinion work better on my face than the name brand one for $20 or more.</li>
      <li>Came very quickly and in good condition.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>So even if it is not that great by that time, I get a new one! :)</li>
      <li>So far, so good!</li>
      <li>My makeup went on really smoothly and the cleaning was very easy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and used</li>
      <li>strong</li>
      <li>/&gt;Hands down, for me, the best applicator for non-water based makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it came really quick!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on the real deal, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!  </li>
      <li>Smaller than i thought, but it works great</li>
      <li>My foundation went on so even and smooth.</li>
      <li>i really liked it.it blended really well.easy to wash nd</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite right now!</li>
      <li>This beauty blender blends my makeup flawlessly and it lasts for a long time I will definitely be purchasing from here from now on</li>
      <li>It does the job I can&#x27;t compare it to the original beauty blender because I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much for makeup sponge.</li>
      <li>For a knock-off, it does the job really well!</li>
      <li>So glad i found this one before i went for the actual $25 beauty blender</li>
      <li>On the first use it ripped on me</li>
      <li>and it did not hav a funny smell at all</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a black beauty blender and it&#x27;s much better than the pink one easy to clean</li>
      <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>Wash it gently and it cracked .</li>
      <li>i was very dissapointed about the quality.</li>
      <li>..i would order from here again, also came really fast in the mail. .</li>
      <li>Other than that, I love it.</li>
      <li>Wayne Goss on youtube mentioned that they should not cost a lot, and after he mentioned this I noticed this same sponge ranging in prices from $2 to $15.I am glad that Winstonia only charged me $2 a piece, which is not only worth the price, but the price you should have to pay for these sponges.</li>
      <li>and I love the black!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s has begun to shed tiny black pieces when I wash it, other than that it&#x27;s greAt to blend cream products</li>
      <li>They are suggested only for non-water based makeups though, as so much of the product is absorbed into the sponge if you do use a water-based liquid, such as a tinted moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I use a tinted moisturizer frequently, so one day I used the sponge and the next day</li>

    <li> Loved this sponge, it can very easily be compared to it&#x27;s 25$ counterpart. Came very quickly and in good condition.</li>
    <li> These are mass produced and sold to companies as a third-party product. Wayne Goss on youtube mentioned that they should not cost a lot, and after he mentioned this I noticed this same sponge ranging in prices from $2 to $15.I am glad that Winstonia only charged me $2 a piece, which is not only worth the price, but the price you should have to pay for these sponges. I would go up to $5, but no more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great, reusable makeup blenders that in my opinion work better on my face than the name brand one for $20 or more. They are suggested only for non-water based makeups though, as so much of the product is absorbed into the sponge if you do use a water-based liquid, such as a tinted moisturizer. I use a tinted moisturizer frequently, so one day I used the sponge and the next day I went back to my brush. I noticed that I used significantly less makeup with the brush than the sponge. But when I apply an HD oil-based makeup with this sponge, the effect is perfectly blended and airbrushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, for me, the best applicator for non-water based makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 01/2014: I have tried these sponges with a variety of bases. This sponge works well with water-based foundations, and BB creams as well. I still don&#x27;t like it for tinted moisturizers.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender blends my makeup flawlessly and it lasts for a long time I will definitely be purchasing from here from now on</li>

    <li> Just got it out of the mail and used it immediately! My foundation went on so even and smooth. My concealer never looked better! So glad i found this one before i went for the actual $25 beauty blender</li>
    <li> Good sponges for the price. I use it to blend out my Mac studio fix concealer. It&#x27;s has begun to shed tiny black pieces when I wash it, other than that it&#x27;s greAt to blend cream products</li>
    <li> I really love how nicely it blends my makeup, it works great and it is also at a great price too.</li>
    <li> I used this once and it made the makeup go on uneven . Wash it gently and it cracked . I am vary disappointed</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a black beauty blender and it&#x27;s much better than the pink one easy to clean and it work miracles.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! For a knock-off, it does the job really well! I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on the real deal, and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t!  My makeup went on really smoothly and the cleaning was very easy. I saw other reviews that said it cracked and pieces of foam were falling off... not sure if they got a bad one or if it was after multiple used, but I have used mine 4 times and washed it 4 times and it&#x27;s still in great shape. I definitely would recommend this product. For $2, you can&#x27;t beat it. Besides, you are supposed to replace even 3 months for sanitary reasons. Germs, bacteria, etc. So even if it is not that great by that time, I get a new one! :)</li>
    <li> Blends my countours just so amazingly, I look like KIM K.</li>
    <li> The quality is good and the price is bomb.com! it works well and great quality. strong and I love the black!</li>
    <li> Smaller than i thought, but it works great (:</li>
    <li> I LLLOOOOOVVEE this!!! My absolute favorite right now! Will definitely recommend to others!!! Plus great for the price and it came really quick!</li>
    <li> Nice shipped to its destination. Received!</li>
    <li> On the first use it ripped on me i was very dissapointed about the quality. I thought it would have lasted me longer</li>
    <li> I Love My Pro Beauty Flawless Makeup Blender Sponge!! I Will Be Ordering For You Guys In The Future. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great dupe for the $25 beauty blender. I love it. It does the job I can&#x27;t compare it to the original beauty blender because I just can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much for makeup sponge.</li>
    <li> This sponge is very stiff.  Shipment was fast.</li>
