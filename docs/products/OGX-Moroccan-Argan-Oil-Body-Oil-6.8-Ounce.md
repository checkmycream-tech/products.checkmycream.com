      <li>I purchased this thinking it would work great on my dry skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells amazing and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
      <li>It is amazing, it leaves my skin soft and moisturized and doesn&#x27;t leave shiny residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great to use after bathing, skin still wet, to help retain the moisture.</li>
      <li>I really liked the dry oil spray much better.  </li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly.</li>
      <li>Sent quickly.</li>
      <li>so when I put it on my face it quickly absorbs and my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny.  </li>
      <li>It smells nice but is very greasy and isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>This oil is worth its weight in gold but not as a massage oil.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good after-bath oil and absorbs quite well, but it&#x27;s still an oil, like any other.</li>
      <li>This is all right.  </li>
      <li>It feels like such a luxurious after-shower treat, and I love that it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
      <li>so thank you very much.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t typically use it in my hair because my hair is fine, but I love it for my skin.</li>
      <li>I am most definitely order through either cosmetic Solution or Amazon.com​</li>
      <li>it can be used in so many different ways.</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I wanted I would recommend this produce to others.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this for use on your legs after shaving!!</li>
      <li>this is a really high quality product for the price!!</li>
      <li>It has a good smell but not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I tried the expensive Moroccan oil and I like it better as it is thicker and gives one a little more time to apply it,  but this was a good price.  </li>
      <li>I am astonish that it help smoother my skin and very silky.</li>
      <li>Very silky and non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Much too oily to use on hair.</li>
      <li>and it absorbs into the skin very well.</li>
      <li>The smell is fresh and soft.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use it like that because it&#x27;ll go fast.  </li>
      <li>I really like it.  </li>
      <li>I guess I should have known by the price, but the #1 ingredient is mineral oil, NOT argan oil, and after reading the bottle, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s organic.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll be good for you.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really hydrating, but it stains almost everything, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to control since it&#x27;s so watery.</li>
      <li>I started using it recently and my skin looks soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>A little bit goes a long way, and leaves skin looking and feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
      <li>I think body oils are truly an essential part of a good skincare regimen when you are living in such a dry climate and at high altitude.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly, but still have dry skin.</li>
      <li>Very soft, leaves skin shiny.</li>

      <li>My body feels so soft when I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>This leaves my skin soft, but it hasn&#x27;t diminished my wrinkles.</li>
      <li>makes hair soft and shiney and doesnt feel oily at all&lt;br /&gt;will buy and use all the time from now on.</li>
      <li>I absolutely did not buy enough of this oil.  </li>
      <li>I really like this dry body oil.</li>
      <li>It really helps keep those areas from getting too dark.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really liked the dry oil spray much better.  This product is ok.  It has nice light fragrance.  Much too oily to use on hair. When I re-order I will go back to the spray type though.</li>
    <li> I really like this dry body oil. It soaks in quickly. I apply it to my still wet skin in the shower and then apply Cetaphil cream directly over it. This is the only regimen that has worked well at keeping my skin moisturized since I relocated to Colorado! I think body oils are truly an essential part of a good skincare regimen when you are living in such a dry climate and at high altitude. Additionally, I like to use this on my elbows, knees, and ankles just before I use my self-tanner. It really helps keep those areas from getting too dark. All around great product and the smell is FANTASTIC!! It feels like such a luxurious after-shower treat, and I love that it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
    <li> I guess I should have known by the price, but the #1 ingredient is mineral oil, NOT argan oil, and after reading the bottle, I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s organic. Maybe I missed it, nut I didn&#x27;t see any of the ingredients labeled as organic!</li>
    <li> It smells nice but is very greasy and isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing.  I get much better results with the vaseline to go spray on lotion.</li>
    <li> i always heard of the argan oil. so i bought it from the rack. it wasnt oily and absorbs well to the skin</li>
    <li> I casually found this oil in a cvs pharmacy and I decided to give it a try. It is amazing, it leaves my skin soft and moisturized and doesn&#x27;t leave shiny residue. I use it almost every day and even though my skin is very sensitive, so far, I haven&#x27;t showed any sings of allergies. The smell is fresh and soft. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is a really high quality product for the price!! I highly reccomend this for use on your legs after shaving!! it helps alot with razor irritation!!  check out my review video in the link!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I wanted I would recommend this produce to others. I will be ordering this again soon so thank you very much.</li>
    <li> It reminds me of baby oil.  But it does not appear to offer smooth skin throughout the day.  Skin dries out like any other oil without moisture..</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it would work great on my dry skin. We just moved to the desert and I thought this would help. Absorbs quickly, but still have dry skin. I just use it as eye make up remover now.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good an it can be used in so many different ways. I add it to the tub or shower. I mix it in my lotions. I even use it alone don&#x27;t hesitate to buy. I love it..</li>
    <li> This oil makes my skin feel so soft and subtle.  I use it after a shower or just rub it on my feet to soothe my aching feet from a long day of standing.</li>
    <li> This is all right.  I tried the expensive Moroccan oil and I like it better as it is thicker and gives one a little more time to apply it,  but this was a good price.  However,  with the shipping and all if I ever buy it again I will do so in the drug store.  It was a good price,  absorbed well,  but didn&#x27;t soften my skin any more than baby oil.</li>
    <li> I must say, i was expecting something a little bit larger. Then again, I&#x27;m not very good at understanding sizes and quantities.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really hydrating, but it stains almost everything, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to control since it&#x27;s so watery.</li>
    <li> I thought that the oil would have been more moisturizing. I had to add baby oil to it. Little Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This one is the best body oil in the world EVER! I do recommend for everyone. Smells like heaven and my skin was sooooo smooth</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to find in the stores... but finally I found it on amazon!  This product is great for your skin, not greasy or oily like most body oil.  Smells great as well! comes in a small bottle however for as little of the product as you need it still last a long time.  Cant go wrong!</li>
    <li> i use argan oil on my hair (different brand) so i thought i would switch from sesamie oil to this for my skin; after my wife and i used only once, we both broke out in red splotches and they itched like crazy. i wish i could return and get my money back. Wendall Ritchey</li>
    <li> I have several Organix products and am happy with all of them. It&#x27;s a good product. The reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is that I don&#x27;t understand why they call this a &amp;#34;dry oil&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s a good after-bath oil and absorbs quite well, but it&#x27;s still an oil, like any other.</li>
    <li> Hair is shiny. Skin is softer. Works great. Sent quickly. Great price. Would recommend it to anyone with thin hair</li>
    <li> I also found this product at CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this along with the Organix Moroccan Argan Oil Creamy Oil Body Lotion and it works great if you want soft and hydrated skin :) The smell is also really great, very exotic. Reminds me of...well, Morocco.</li>
    <li> Very silky and non-greasy. A little bit goes a long way, and leaves skin looking and feeling smooth and healthy.</li>
    <li> I am constantly looking for products for my face.  I came across this one and decided to give it a try.  It has a good smell but not overwhelming.  It&#x27;s not greasy so when I put it on my face it quickly absorbs and my face doesn&#x27;t look shiny.  I bought it specifically for my face but it&#x27;s good for all over.  I don&#x27;t use it like that because it&#x27;ll go fast.  It&#x27;s not a big bottle.  I even use it on my hair to give it a shine.  I really like it.  Doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll be good for you.</li>
    <li> Very soft, leaves skin shiny. It looks magical because is rapidly absorbed!&lt;br /&gt;A product with a very good value for money.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend everyone.</li>
    <li> makes hair soft and shiney and doesnt feel oily at all&lt;br /&gt;will buy and use all the time from now on.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of Argan oil.  I have used other moisturizers that just smell terrible.  This leaves my skin soft, but it hasn&#x27;t diminished my wrinkles. It is very sloppy to put on, after all it is an oil. I will keep using it until the next fad comes along.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. The oil doesn&#x27;t moisturize well enough. Even if you use lots of it. Bad investment. My skin remains dry even repeated use.</li>
    <li> This product implies an amazing and very sensual to use on behalf of my skin. I am astonish that it help smoother my skin and very silky. I extremely love it! I would love to have more of this product. I appreciate and learn more about this best Organix product. I am most definitely order through either cosmetic Solution or Amazon.com​</li>

    <li> I absolutely did not buy enough of this oil.  I have tried several and this is the best by far.  I use it for hair and skin.  You will LOVE this !</li>
    <li> I love this body oil. My body feels so soft when I get out of the shower. This oil is AWESOME!</li>
    <li> He leido maravillas sobre el aceite de Argán, al aprecer es una joya para el cuidado del cabello y la piel. Comencé a usarlo hace poco y mi piel luce suave y tersa. Es muy bueno usarlo después del baño, con la piel aún humeda, para que ayude a retener esa humedad. En el cabello aún no lo he usado, pero al parecer es también excelente. No tengo quejas del producto se los recomiendo 100%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read rave about Argan oil, to aprecer is a gem for hair care and skin. I started using it recently and my skin looks soft and smooth. It&#x27;s great to use after bathing, skin still wet, to help retain the moisture. In hair have not used it yet, but apparently it is also excellent. I have no complaints of the product they recommend 100%</li>
