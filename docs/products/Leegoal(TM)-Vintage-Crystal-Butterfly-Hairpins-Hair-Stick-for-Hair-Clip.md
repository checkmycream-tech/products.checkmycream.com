    <li> Item arrived in a fair amount of time and was exactly as described. I love it and use it practically every chance I get.</li>
    <li> For the price, you won&#x27;t find anything better.  Well-made and beautiful.  The photos do not do this bowknot justice!</li>
    <li> Too large, feel bulgy. It didn&#x27;t stay on your hair. I have a lot of hair, still didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super big. Really chunky and heavy. But I like it, and I&#x27;ll wear it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! It&#x27;s so big and beautiful! The only problem is that&#x27;s it&#x27;s REALLY heavy!</li>
    <li> Clip is pretty ,company emailed me is sending out replacement , thank you</li>
    <li> Very pretty and heavy. Would require a decent amount of hair to hold comfortably. Good quality. Took a while to ship but was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Received on times. Not what I expected. Its not the picture shown. More reds and dark blues.. No pink.</li>
    <li> I love that clip! Its beautiful and easily keeps my hair in place. I wear it with almost every outfit I can find to match it.</li>

    <li> Very pretty stays in my fine hair without sliding out</li>
    <li> This is a cute little hair clip.  I love the color and size.  Works well.  My only problem is it&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
    <li> Crystals were not the color in this advertisement. I wanted pastels. The one sent red, blue, gold. Not worth sending back....</li>
    <li> This is really cute and well made. It is a little bit heavy though, and also bigger than I imagined thus only 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Even prettier in person</li>
    <li> Beautiful and does not look cheap its very heavy. Fast shipping got it a month sooner than expected!</li>
    <li> These clips are soooo pretty, large and well made.  I love them all and will try to get one or two of each for myself and my sister.  thank you.</li>

    <li> Very gorgeous hair clip especially on my dark red hair.  I had lots of compliment when I wore it at a wedding party.</li>
    <li> This is a must have.  The colors are gorgeous.  I use these clips to hold scarves.  Would definitely recommend.  Good deal, too.</li>
    <li> I had no idea this was so large. I should have read the description better. But I ordered others and loved them, so I thought this was the same. This is large and heavy and I am not sure it will be used. I purchased it for my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, nice sparkle, perfect for proms, weddings, formal events.  I would recommend it and would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Super cute, the colors are a little different, seems like red &amp; green are the colors that stand out the most but overall a very cute clip. Not too big, or too heavy, I can pull my hair back in a half pony tail &amp; clip it &amp; it isn&#x27;t too heavy &amp; stays in place. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll like this one.</li>
    <li> very beautiful!  I get complements when I wear it</li>
    <li> Beautiful. Well made. Doesn&#x27;t hold thicknl hair very well. Needs extra support from bobby pins.</li>
    <li> This hair piece is very elegant and weel made, it is NOT something that will break easily. This hair clip is great for casual or formal occasions. I have received many compliments on this piece:)</li>
    <li> This is very beautiful!  I have long hair a little past my waist and it&#x27;s thick.  This clip holds my hair fine and I don&#x27;t have to use bobbie pins.  It came sooner then expected.  I am so glad that I ordered it. I put my hair in a ponytail, then twist it into a bun.  Then I use this clip to hold the ends. I put the bow on the side of the bun.  It looks really cute and it stays in my hair.  I am so glad that I ordered it.  I highly recommend buying this clip.</li>
    <li> Finishes off an updo beautifully. Took a long time to get here, pictures don&#x27;t do justice.  Not to heavy, and doesn&#x27;t snag or pull hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty and well made</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! The colors were actually a little brighter than expected, but I really like it and have gotten many compliments!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty clip.  The colors of the stones are more of a red and green mix.  It will be lovely for Christmas.  I wish it had more blue stones, which is what the online photo looked like to me, but they are more green stones.  It is real pretty and good quality, stays in my fine hair nicely.  When I put my hair up in a bun or ponytail, it sits nicely and looks great in my hair.</li>
    <li> Really lovely; this is much larger and more substantial than I expected!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my Granddaughter, although she has waist length hair it was very heavy. She didn&#x27;t seem to like it very well, the extra weight made her head hurt and it was very dull to look at. It is a disappointment, due to the price  and some health problems it is not worth the effort it would take to send back.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CGKC6LI/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
    <li> My favorite accessory, and for the price, OMG!</li>
    <li> This product has been a great addition to my hair accessories! I get compliments allllll the time wondering where I got it from! It is cute vintage hair accessory!!!!!!</li>
    <li> really very pretty.  looks vintage.  VERY heavy.</li>
    <li> Very pretty but heavy.</li>
    <li> I was so surprise of the size the decent sturdiness &amp; the cuteness of this hair clip just what i always wanted. thought i would have to pay a lot to have these type of hair clips it doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all, nice stones and very antique look, girls you will be complimented. i recommend. and what a great price, i was a little impatient waiting for it but worth the wait i bought a few more so it help being patient because as they come 1 or 2 at a time that I am so busy enjoying the ones I received and forgot about the others. i am very gentle and careful with them even the nicest things get broken</li>
    <li> I love it. Its beautiful and perfect. Thank you.</li>
    <li> took forever to receive, but am incredibly impressed with the size and quality! Looks vintage and girly, it is a little heavy, but I use it for accents to a messy updo and buns. It holds very strong so far.</li>
    <li> Great value for the money.  All the colorful stones make it easy to match out fits.</li>
    <li> Cute, a little heavy but works well  with thick hair.</li>
    <li> Very pretty, was missing a stone, but nothing major.</li>
    <li> Very heavy! Nice material. Very nicely made. Arrived early.</li>
    <li> Looks great.  Made well.  Stays put in my hair. I get lots of compliments on it.  I tell everyone where I got it!</li>
    <li> Pretty, but  I expected it to be larger</li>
    <li> this clip is lovely, an excellent touch for the hair. My daughter and I both use it, she has a lot of hair so she can wear it otherwise for girls with short hair, I think it will be a little too heavy.</li>
    <li> This clip looks really cute, but it can&#x27;t hold into the hair, I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
    <li> love it! little heavy not good for bangs or short hair .</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite hair clips.  The color of the metal looks great with my hair.</li>
