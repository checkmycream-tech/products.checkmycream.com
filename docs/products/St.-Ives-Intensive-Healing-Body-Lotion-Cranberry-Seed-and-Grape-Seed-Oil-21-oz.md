      <li>had good ingredients in it.  </li>
      <li>It is also inexpensive, so that&#x27;s a good bonus.</li>

      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is good lotion, it has a pleasant smell, soaks into the skin really well, and it is not oily what so ever.</li>
      <li>I use this mainly in the winter because it does a very good job of keeping my skin  hydrated without feeling like I just covered myself in grease.</li>

      <li>i love the smell i gave this to my mom</li>
      <li>This product also does a great job of moisturizing my skin that lasts for the whole day.</li>
      <li>Better.</li>
      <li>This was a top recommended lotion from Beautypedia.</li>
      <li>I have been using a variety of St Ives products for years and this lotion dryed my skin out even more.  </li>
      <li>I love this product and I recommend it to everyone :)</li>
      <li>so the fact that it was on the cheap side AND has a high quantity content is great.  </li>
      <li>Best of all though, I put it on at night after showering and it lasts a full day till the next night.  </li>
      <li>and I love it being delivered straight to my door, instead of DRIVING to the store, hoping the product is there, and paying more for it!</li>
      <li>What I like about it is that it&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like strong lotion smells</li>
      <li>hope they make a version that is fragrance free again....</li>
      <li>Smells great and hydrates skin just enough.</li>
      <li>The smell is also light</li>
      <li>I faithfully massage it in nightly as well and it helps my skin feel smooth as a babies bottom</li>
      <li>It has a great fragrance and lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Nice and light for young kids.</li>
      <li>Fragrance free (or so mild</li>
      <li>I love that it&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin and has many natural moisturizers, though I do feel that with the claim of \\&quot;100%</li>
      <li>delivers a reasonable amount each time and the size is appropriate for regular/daily use.</li>
      <li>They should have left this alone and made a stink version for those women that want that, instead of getting rid of a good thing.</li>
      <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Smells good, not too strong or heavy and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
      <li>This lotion moisturizes really well, but has a light texture and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>very thing was fine</li>
      <li>Great for these harsh winter months.</li>
      <li>This one works in all seasons for me--not a lot of scent, just fresh.</li>
      <li>I wanted a reasonably priced body lotion with a mild scent and no mineral oil in it.</li>
      <li>I really like the mild smell.</li>
      <li>I think that st. Ives has such great products considering how affordable it is, only $4!</li>
      <li>I got a sample size of this lotion when I was traveling in Maui and liked it so much I came home and got two giant bottles from Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly and works very well.</li>
      <li>It is thick but absorbs quickly and has a nice scent that&#x27;s not too strong.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin soft and smelling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Probably my favorite thing, though, is the scent - with so many cheap lotions out there, scent makes one stand out over others, and this has a very natural smell of light cranberry juice (due, possibly, to the cranberry seed oil ingredient, but there is added fragrance).</li>
      <li>The main reason why I started purchasing this drugstore lotion is because it moisturized effectively and overall</li>
      <li>Priced better on amazon than at my local stores.</li>
      <li>To be honest, I usually just buy cheap lotion.  </li>
      <li>I felt a difference in my skin the first time I used this lotion.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty close and pretty affordable.</li>
      <li>This used to be a favorite product until they recently re-formulated with a scent.</li>
      <li>I mix it with petroleum jelly or shea butter and lather my feet before bed which keeps my feet soft and cuddle friendly ^_^</li>
      <li>My skin looks and feels super soft.</li>
      <li>It feels good going on, and definitely last the day, but if your looking for it to help with severe dry skin patches or psoriasis, it won&#x27;t really do that.</li>
      <li>The scent is very neutral</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>natural moisturizers\\&quot; and the tag line of \\&quot;Fresh.</li>
      <li>Not oily and very relaxing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this body lotion!</li>
      <li>The attack is a sucker punch of bold, face-scowling sugar followed by a syrupy mid-palate of that loiters more than lingers.  </li>
      <li>, found the lotion with the same picture (though St. Ives does not list all ingredients), then I checked here, and sure enough!  </li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t feel like it over powers my high quality, designer perfume.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this! Great for massages. Not greasy. Not too girl-y smelling either so my hubby doesn&#x27;t mind when I use it on him for a massage :)</li>
    <li> I love this product brand.  I felt a difference in my skin the first time I used this lotion.</li>
    <li> This lotion is great - thick, but not too thick.  It has a great fragrance and lasts a long time.  Great deal on Amazon.  I have this on Subscribe and Save and it is a great deal.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lotion. Non greasy and truly heals the skin.</li>
    <li> This lotion moisturizes really well, but has a light texture and absorbs quickly. My skin looks and feels super soft. Probably my favorite thing, though, is the scent - with so many cheap lotions out there, scent makes one stand out over others, and this has a very natural smell of light cranberry juice (due, possibly, to the cranberry seed oil ingredient, but there is added fragrance). I love that it&#x27;s suitable for sensitive skin and has many natural moisturizers, though I do feel that with the claim of \\&quot;100% natural moisturizers\\&quot; and the tag line of \\&quot;Fresh. Better. Naturally\\&quot; people may be misled into thinking the product is completely natural in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be worth noting to some that the ingredients on the Amazon listing were somewhat different from the ingredients on the bottle I received, which are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Glycerin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, Stearic Acid, Cetyl Alcohol, Urea, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Seed Butter, Theobrama Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter, Dimethicone, PEG-100 Stearate, Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Carbomer, Fragrance, Triethanolamine, BHT, Phenoxyethanol, Methylisothiazolinone, Caprilyl Glycol, Disodium EDTA.</li>
    <li> This used to be a favorite product until they recently re-formulated with a scent. I wish they wouldn&#x27;t change a product that is already excellent. What I like about it is that it&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs easily into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they make a version that is fragrance free again....</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. Not oily and very relaxing. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores.</li>
    <li> very thing was fine i like this cream have gotten from you before.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great but why didthey change the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who will stand up and make a great product with no scent please.</li>
    <li> I got a sample size of this lotion when I was traveling in Maui and liked it so much I came home and got two giant bottles from Amazon.  I keep one on my desk and one at home.  It isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy and it has the most pleasant, very light scent.  It seems like much more expensive lotion than it is.</li>
    <li> The smell of the lotion, 5 stars,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the moisturizing part, 4 stars, it is fine, not surprisingly great, but also not bad at all, I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Only scent I purchase.  Nice and light for young kids.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve all tried a lot of lotions--some smell great, some are good for winter skin, some for summertime. This one works in all seasons for me--not a lot of scent, just fresh. Absorbs quickly. Fewer chemicals than some others. Please don&#x27;t change it or discontinue it. I usually buy a couple of bottles at a time.</li>
    <li> I love this prouduct. It makes my skin so soft.</li>
    <li> The best thing about this is the price.  I have to use a LOT of lotion so the fact that it was on the cheap side AND has a high quantity content is great.  The smell is also light so I don&#x27;t feel like it over powers my high quality, designer perfume.  Great buy.  I dont really appreciate that this still has mineral oil in it (which isn&#x27;t TOO terrible) but if you&#x27;re looking for a more natural lotion that is also affordable, I&#x27;d go with something else like Everyday Shea Moisturizing Body Lotion.  Some of these lotions (I&#x27;m not sure if this is true for all of their scents) has a chemical preservative so it&#x27;s not 100% natural but it&#x27;s pretty close and pretty affordable.</li>
    <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that great, but it moisturizes.</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives body lotions and this one is no exception. It has no real scent to it, and the formulation is nice and thick. I use this mainly in the winter because it does a very good job of keeping my skin  hydrated without feeling like I just covered myself in grease. It soaks in quickly and works very well. I highly recommend this body lotion!</li>
    <li> Until I noticed that mineral oil is in the lotion.  The main reason why I started purchasing this drugstore lotion is because it moisturized effectively and overall had good ingredients in it.  But, I refuse to use any beauty/toiletry products that contain mineral oil and I know that my past bottles did not contain any mineral oil in the ingredient list.  Too bad because the price was right through the subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
    <li> This lotion is non greasy and serves the purposes. I love this product and I recommend it to everyone :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this lotion. It also does a great job moisturizing. I have always had a difficult time finding a sensitive lotion that wouldn&#x27;t give me a rash after using. This works perfect and will order again!</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and I have used several bottles. I am so happy to have found a reliable product and no longer feel the need to try something new when I run out. I wanted a reasonably priced body lotion with a mild scent and no mineral oil in it. This product does all of this at a good price. This product also does a great job of moisturizing my skin that lasts for the whole day. I also like to use it as a cream face wash in the morning as my skin is very dry.</li>
    <li> I do not like the smell and it&#x27;s not as creamy as I had thought it would be for &amp;#34;dry skin&amp;#34; I&#x27;m going to stick with gold bond lotion.</li>
    <li> Fragrance free (or so mild it&#x27;s not noticeable). Moisturizes deeply but not so thick that it feels heavy. Great for these harsh winter months. Priced better on amazon than at my local stores. I mix it with petroleum jelly or shea butter and lather my feet before bed which keeps my feet soft and cuddle friendly ^_^</li>
    <li> I like the scent of the \\&quot;new\\&quot; lotion. Not only that, but it solves my skin&#x27;s propensity to dryness very effectively. [[ASIN:B006L5BPCU St. Ives Intensive Healing Body Lotion, 21 Ounce]]</li>
    <li> Wow! I&#x27;m impressed with this lotion.  To be honest, I usually just buy cheap lotion.  I mean really cheap lotion, like from the dollar store, thinking how much different could it be?  Isn&#x27;t lotion just lotion with different marketing and/or packaging?  Oh, but I was a naive girl!  St. Ive&#x27;s Intensive Healing Body Lotion is thick &amp; creamy, my skin drinks it up and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.  Best of all though, I put it on at night after showering and it lasts a full day till the next night.  I no longer get that unpleasant dry, tight winter-skin feeling where you feel all sand-papery and scratchy, like the only thing that might help would be sitting in a vat of lotion. I&#x27;m a convert.</li>
    <li> I have been using a variety of St Ives products for years and this lotion dryed my skin out even more.  I find that I have had to apply it numerous times throughout the day and still wake up with itchy skin at night.  I have had to switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> This was a top recommended lotion from Beautypedia. I like the light, pleasant scent and the rich texture of this lotion. It is moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved St Ives lotions.  They work well all day to eliminate my winter dry skin itch.  However, they have changed their lotions.  Think almost gell-like.  Still relives the itch, but I just don&#x27;t like how it feels going on, so I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> I think that st. Ives has such great products considering how affordable it is, only $4! I love the smell, it&#x27;s not to greasy and I definitely stay moisturized all day. My bf even notices how soft I am all of the time. This is good stuff! I will definitely keep buying it.</li>
    <li> After experimenting with other sensitive-skin lotions, the St Ives Intensive Healing Body Lotion met my specifications.  The scent is very neutral so it is acceptable for men.  It maintains skin moisture during the dry weather here in the Southwest.  The price on Amazon was a few cents cheaper than when purchased locally, if and when you can find it.  I gave this product and price five stars.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula and I am not happy.  The feel of the lotion is different.  Label says it is &amp;#34;lightly scented&amp;#34;.  One of the reasons I used this is because it was unscented.  No longer using this.</li>
    <li> I really wish they wouldn&#x27;t mess with things when they have it right. This was one of the best lotions on the market and it didn&#x27;t stink before they changed the formula. This new formula works almost as well, but as a man, I can&#x27;t stand stinking for hours after I use it. They should have left this alone and made a stink version for those women that want that, instead of getting rid of a good thing.</li>
    <li> In the glass, body lotion is murky and opaque, with suspicious-looking surface foam.  Aromatics conjure memories of summer camp the year you discovered wedgies: Welch&#x27;s grape juice and torn jockeys.  The attack is a sucker punch of bold, face-scowling sugar followed by a syrupy mid-palate of that loiters more than lingers.  The stalking finish is cloaked in buyer&#x27;s remorse.</li>
    <li> Smells great and hydrates skin just enough. I do not feel sticky or greasy. I like that it is a soft smell. We all use it in the family (except not baby) but I think it works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what everyone is complaining about when it comes to the &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; of this lotion. I read the reviews before I bought this product and it seemed like half the people said it was great lotion and the other half said it was &amp;#34;ruined&amp;#34; because St. Ives added a scent to it. Yes, there is a scent, but unless you apply a handful of it directly to your face you will hardly even notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is good lotion, it has a pleasant smell, soaks into the skin really well, and it is not oily what so ever.</li>
    <li> I was not able to resist this lotion after smelling it in the store. It has the best, very fresh, light scent that I&#x27;m in love with. I don&#x27;t like strong lotion smells, they make me feel sick to my stomach and make my head hurt, but this one is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the texture of this, not greasy, but keeps my skin mouisturized. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin soft and smelling amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I went back to the store and purchased another bottle to keep in my office. Everyone who smells it when I apply it to my hands ask what smells so good.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly, moisturizes well, and doesn&#x27;t leave any oily or heavy residue. It has a nice fragrance too, very subtle.</li>
    <li> When I saw &amp;#34;Intensive Healing&amp;#34; I was thinking this might be comparable to Gold Bond, which I hate buying because of the price and the fact that the last 1/4 of the lotion gets stuck in the bottom of the bottle. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work quite that well, but it does work. It feels good going on, and definitely last the day, but if your looking for it to help with severe dry skin patches or psoriasis, it won&#x27;t really do that. Smells good, not too strong or heavy and doesn&#x27;t linger. Happy Moisturizing!</li>
    <li> This works extremely well for dry skin especially in the winter.  It is thick but absorbs quickly and has a nice scent that&#x27;s not too strong.  It is also inexpensive, so that&#x27;s a good bonus.</li>
    <li> my friend told me my skin was soft i love the smell i gave this to my mom but i use it mostly</li>
    <li> I love St. Ives lotion every variety feel so thick and creamy. It definitely keeps me hydrated and not my skin feeling dry</li>
    <li> This lotion smells awesome and works really well! I will definitely order it again!</li>
    <li> Very nice scent. One of the few lotions that seems to penetrate deeply without leaving greasy feeling on the skin. Lasts for wuite a while compared to some other lotions.</li>
    <li> This is the only truly non-greasy intensive moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.  It sinks right in and keeps even the driest winter hands soft.</li>
    <li> Would recommend this lotion to anyone who needs to wash their hands a lot.  Leaves skin soft, but not greasy.  Great price and I love it being delivered straight to my door, instead of DRIVING to the store, hoping the product is there, and paying more for it!</li>
    <li> I really like the mild smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product represented at the time I write this review for years.  My husband would go to the Big W and stock up every now and then.  Recently, he notified me he can no longer find the fragrance-free lotion that was for so long a household staple.  So I went to the St. Ives website, found the lotion with the same picture (though St. Ives does not list all ingredients), then I checked here, and sure enough!  Amazon still has it.  I read the ingredients list, and it has the same photo as what I&#x27;ve been using, so I bought SIX!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the reviews, too, because this is not the same lotion.  It&#x27;s reformulated, with fewer of the good juju ingredients.  And it contains fragrance.  It is definitely not the same product.  I still have a bottle of the fragrance-free, and even the UPC code is changed.  So, a major disappointment for me, because this was the only fragrance-free, effective, cheap body lotion I could find, besides Vaseline Intensive Care, and I don&#x27;t care for that product so much.  While I&#x27;m going through these six bottles, I&#x27;ll be hunting for another fragrance-free.  CeraVe is great, and a little goes a long way, so it&#x27;s not as expensive as it seems, but it still isn&#x27;t as cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is still a good moisturizer if you don&#x27;t mind fragrance in your skin care products.  If that&#x27;s the case, buy it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> WTH? What kind of morons do they think we are?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy and use a bottle. Paid about $4.40.&lt;br /&gt;Very good lotion.</li>
    <li> Ooooo how silky my winter skin is!!!  This is by far best non-greasy healing lotion!  Faintly smells, so my hubby can use it on his mechanic dry, cut, split, hands as well.  I use it EVERYDAY when I get out from the shower, from neck to tip toe!  With no build-up, I always look forward to my next session with it!  I faithfully massage it in nightly as well and it helps my skin feel smooth as a babies bottom and I still feel extremely soft after a shower! Such a quality product. I highly recommend it! I can&#x27;t wait to see what it does to my skin in the summer after a long day at the pool! Amazon offers an incredible value!</li>
    <li> Rich, emollient cream without being greasy was exactly what I needed for my poor legs and elbows this winter. To put in context, I usually use straight-up petroleum jelly or L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s shea butter to deal with winter dryness (after having tried many other brands over the years, those two have been my fall-backs. Until now!). The label isn&#x27;t lying -- I really do only need to put it on once per day (except for hands, of course).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I get very dry skin, mine is not sensitive, so unfortunately, I can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pump delivers a reasonable amount each time and the size is appropriate for regular/daily use.</li>
