      <li>The shape of the tube is innovative and is a great fit for applying to the lips.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s very strong on application.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>

      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love the Neutrogena naturals lip balm</li>

      <li>I took off one star because I would like to see some more colors.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>dry/cakey like so many tinted lip balms.</li>
      <li>What more could a girl want?</li>
      <li>This is one my favorite product to wear on my lips.</li>
      <li>Has a nice clean scent without the flavor.</li>
      <li>The oval shape of this tube makes it easy to find in your purse.</li>
      <li>and it smells strongly of banana.</li>
      <li>I bought the healthy blush and although a little light for my summer skin tone its perfect for my winter skin.</li>
      <li>Product goes on smooth with a hint of color.</li>
      <li>Smooth and silky with just a hint of shimmer and color.</li>
      <li>I received this item for free as a bzzagent.  </li>
      <li>smooth lips even when i take it off</li>
      <li>wow i loved it .</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good texture and moisturizes well, however, and these are both personal taste complaints, so I won&#x27;t give a lower rating.</li>
      <li>I mean it WAS a great lip balm after all!</li>
      <li>If you like shimmer (or already have super smooth,full lips) and you like banana</li>
      <li>This is my new favorite tinted lip balm.</li>
      <li>This was my first try at the lip balm!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to get more!</li>
      <li>I am used to balms leaving more of a natural look (like with chapstick) than shiny (like lip gloss).  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised with how smooth it went on!</li>
      <li>I really love this lip balm, I have very large lips that dry out super easily in the winter.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>It comes in a flat oval tube that easily falls out of pockets and probably would get lost forever in a purse!</li>
      <li>I tried this on for the first time</li>
      <li>I love lip balms with tints, and I would definitely say that this is a winner.</li>
      <li>Not sticky and does not taste funny.</li>
      <li>It feels like a good balm, maybe a little bit stiffer or dryer but not by much.</li>
      <li>The colors looked subtle but great.</li>
      <li>When I first got this lip balm I really luvd it...</li>
      <li>The color was actually really pleasing when applied (because I have dark lips and typically tints don&#x27;t look very good on me) and stayed on pretty well.</li>
      <li>Best of all was definitely that it moisturized while giving me a nice subtle but not invisible color (even with my dark lips)!!</li>
      <li>The product is very good; unfortunately, the oval shape is user-unfriendly.</li>
      <li>but this one is not too much.  </li>
      <li>wish I didn&#x27;t spend as much on this product as I did.</li>
      <li>I really like the taste as does my boyfriend</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last particularly long, but my lips are so much better after having used it.</li>
      <li>Color is subtle but nice.</li>
      <li>It feels like such a creamy lipstick but with a hint of color and shimmer and SO MUCH MOISTURE!</li>
      <li>My two big problems with this balm are that it is VERY shimmery compared to pictures</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too soft, colorless on my lips, and leaves my lips looking chapped.</li>
      <li>It looks &amp;#34;icy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;frosted.&amp;#34; I feel like an old lady or</li>
      <li>a twelve year old wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I have the petal glow color, and I was surprised with the taste (citrus) and</li>
      <li>I love the subtle shine and color it gives.</li>
      <li>I wanted something to make my lips look more dressed, a little bit of peach or pink in addition to the dewiness a balm gives.</li>
      <li>It IS a very good lip balm and for those of us who hate lipstick, it is just as functional.</li>
      <li>I saw that it had shimmer in it, which I don&#x27;t like, but in all the reviews and pictures I looked at it looked barely noticeable.</li>
      <li>which they had it in a much lighter color of pink</li>
      <li>Since I sometimes tire of the regular clear balms, I like to mix it up with the tints and experiment with different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I go through a ridiculous amount of lip balms because my lips get chapped really easily in the dry weather and tend to flake and crack if I don&#x27;t apply balm regularly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff. Feels really good on my lips.</li>
    <li> This is one my favorite product to wear on my lips. I usually use this brand for when I want some color and the Nivea Lip Butter for when I don&#x27;t. After trying all the colors on this brand I picked Petal Glow. I love the subtle shine and color it gives. Has a nice clean scent without the flavor. Keeps my lips moist and lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> The balm does not stay on lips more than 15 minutes.It is a waste of money i would never buy this again.BUY Covergirl Outlast  Lipstain  instead .I  Bought it in color #427 and it lasts along time does not blister my lips in sun has sunscreen and has a good feel and taste on lips ...</li>
    <li> This lip balm gives just a hint of color which I like.  Sometimes pink colors are too pink but this one is not too much.  I received this item for free as a bzzagent.  It is a great moisturizer for the lip which helps out here in the Las Vegas desert.  I&#x27;m not sure if it makes my lips fuller but I will use this also because it is spy 20.</li>
    <li> It is not noticeable that I have it on.  I like how it makes my lips feel.</li>
    <li> Having avoided lipstick like the plague ever since I can remember, I thought this would be a great alternative. Yes, it was!!! I got the Petal Glow which is like a mocha mauve like color. It suited my fair coloring nicely and would suit anyone I think. It smelled amazing and went on like a dream. Smooth and silky with just a hint of shimmer and color. It keeps your lips moisturized for hours with little to no re-application. And the best part is that the color still lingers after it wears off. I lost mine in a cab. I&#x27;m still sad about it. I mean it WAS a great lip balm after all! It has color, kept lips nice and smooth, and had SPF too! What more could a girl want? But alas, it does have its faults. It comes in a flat oval tube that easily falls out of pockets and probably would get lost forever in a purse! I don&#x27;t know why they went with an oval design and so small! It&#x27;s tiny. I&#x27;ve seen chapsticks that are bigger. But I digress. It IS a very good lip balm and for those of us who hate lipstick, it is just as functional. Color, moisture, and sunscreen in one little package. It&#x27;s definitely on my list of makeup alternatives. Would I recommend? You bet!!! I think I won&#x27;t replace the Petal Glow yet, I might go with a berry and see what that does. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this product. The shape of the tube is innovative and is a great fit for applying to the lips. It has a pleasant smell.. like melons maybe? Definitely not overpowering. It feels like such a creamy lipstick but with a hint of color and shimmer and SO MUCH MOISTURE! It lasts about 4 hours before reapplying. I will repurchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the Neutrogena naturals lip balm and I decided to try this one, expecting as good quality and the plus of some color. Although the color is natural and quite good the texture of the balm is greasy and a little unpleasant. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love lip balms with tints, and I would definitely say that this is a winner. I go through a ridiculous amount of lip balms because my lips get chapped really easily in the dry weather and tend to flake and crack if I don&#x27;t apply balm regularly. Since I sometimes tire of the regular clear balms, I like to mix it up with the tints and experiment with different brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this on for the first time I was really surprised with how smooth it went on! It didn&#x27;t have that sticky, waxy feel that a lot of tinted balms have and I thanked the lord. The color was actually really pleasing when applied (because I have dark lips and typically tints don&#x27;t look very good on me) and stayed on pretty well. Best of all was definitely that it moisturized while giving me a nice subtle but not invisible color (even with my dark lips)!! I&#x27;m definitely going to get more!</li>
    <li> which they had it in a much lighter color of pink I&#x27;m a pink kinda girl!!!!</li>
    <li> I normally do not wear lipstick but I do love my Chapstick! This is my &amp;#34;glam&amp;#34; product! A bit pricy but it has lasted me a couple of months already.</li>
    <li> The oval shape of this tube makes it easy to find in your purse. However, it&#x27;s awkward to apply to your mouth (unless you have a really weird-shaped mouth.) I found the consistency of the lipstick to be heavy and waxy, with too-light colour and a nasty feel... heavy oil or something. Plus, in the warm weather it melts! A waste and kinda gross too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m always looking for great lip tint with sunscreen, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this again.</li>
    <li> When I first got this lip balm I really luvd it...it does moistens your lip..but the color is a little off 4 my lips</li>
    <li> This is my go-to lip moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t last particularly long, but my lips are so much better after having used it. I put lipstick on once a day and then use this the rest of the day. I put it my pocket so I always have it with me! I took off one star because I would like to see some more colors.</li>
    <li> I really love this lip balm, I have very large lips that dry out super easily in the winter. So I am constantly buying lip balm in order to remedy this, and I have been trying to find a signature tinted balm for a while I bought the healthy blush and although a little light for my summer skin tone its perfect for my winter skin. I really like the taste as does my boyfriend so i&#x27;m unsure what the other reviewers are talking about maybe they changed the taste? I bought the balm just last week and it takes like refreshing lemony-lime taste, my boyfriend said it tasted like I had just sucked on a lime :)</li>
    <li> This lip balm is a little expensive for lip gloss, but I believe it is worth it. It smells great, has a great shine to it, and the color is very pretty/natural. I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I love everything neutrogena puts out! This was my first try at the lip balm! The hint of color was perfect! I can&#x27;t say enough about it! I will be buying more soon! Maybe a six pack!</li>
    <li> The product is very good; unfortunately, the oval shape is user-unfriendly. It wears down unevenly and is a pain to apply.</li>
    <li> I have the petal glow color, and I was surprised with the taste (citrus) and how shiny it is on the lips.  I am used to balms leaving more of a natural look (like with chapstick) than shiny (like lip gloss).  Color is subtle but nice.</li>
    <li> I have bought a lot of Neutrogena products, but I don&#x27;t like this lip balm.  It&#x27;s too soft, colorless on my lips, and leaves my lips looking chapped.</li>
    <li> This is not a lip balm or anything! it leaves chucks of the colors in my lips and it looks very bad. I am not sure what to think of it, I throw it out!</li>
    <li> Handy to carry as you need to keep reapplying .</li>
    <li> wow i loved it . My fav shade. smooth lips even when i take it off</li>
    <li> Love the color, love the 20 SPF protection, love the moisturizing affect, and I really love that it can be used as a lipstick for work.  The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the price, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Product goes on smooth with a hint of color. On the neutral side with a slight shimmer. Not sticky and does not taste funny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed by this product. My two big problems with this balm are that it is VERY shimmery compared to pictures and it smells strongly of banana. It&#x27;s a good texture and moisturizes well, however, and these are both personal taste complaints, so I won&#x27;t give a lower rating. (I purchased &amp;#34;petal glow&amp;#34; if this displays on other colors&#x27; pages too.)&lt;br /&gt;I looked at color swatches, user pictures, and examples for hours before I bought this. I saw that it had shimmer in it, which I don&#x27;t like, but in all the reviews and pictures I looked at it looked barely noticeable. The colors looked subtle but great. In person that is not the case. The shimmer is so pronounced that any benefit of the color is lost. I wanted something to make my lips look more dressed, a little bit of peach or pink in addition to the dewiness a balm gives. This is not that!! It makes my lips look lighter and smaller. It looks &amp;#34;icy&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;frosted.&amp;#34; I feel like an old lady or a twelve year old wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, unmentioned in anything is that the scent of this product is...banana?? Artificial candy banana &amp;#34;Runts&amp;#34; banana. I hate banana and this is really gross to me. The scent doesn&#x27;t linger at least but it&#x27;s very strong on application.&lt;br /&gt;What I do like about this product is the way it feels on my lips. It feels like a good balm, maybe a little bit stiffer or dryer but not by much. If you like shimmer (or already have super smooth,full lips) and you like banana you&#x27;ll probably like this product.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I didn&#x27;t spend as much on this product as I did. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to use it.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite tinted lip balm. It smells terrific, glides on and moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t get dry/cakey like so many tinted lip balms.</li>
    <li> love the color and it doesn&#x27;t leave a bad taste</li>
</ol>
