      <li>The supplier could have done better than this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of people who use and love this product, but it was just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>

      <li>I was a new user, but now a true expert LoL Love the color blends well and leaves no mess</li>
      <li>I love the color don&#x27;t need to use much</li>
      <li>must say, a big part of what makes this eyebrow pencil so great its how thin the pencil is, which allows you to create the perfect shape for your brows</li>
      <li>I love this eyebrow pencil, easy to use, makes my eyebrows look natural.</li>
      <li>Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described.</li>
      <li>I love mac but this particular item looked as tho</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly in the mail too.</li>
      <li>I love my new spiked eye pencil</li>
      <li>This eyebrow pencil is worth</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like to have my eyebrows look so dark which is why spiked its such a perfect color for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked MAC brow pencils because they are thin, have an automatic sharpener at the top as the pencil comes out (so it&#x27;s never thick or crayon-ish) and are so easy to hold and manuever.</li>
      <li>It stays on pretty well in the shower (I don&#x27;t wash my face in the shower though)</li>

      <li>I had to go back and buy the right color from another seller.</li>
      <li>I love it an use it everyday!  </li>
      <li>Somehow, I did not get the same results, much as I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t get over how natural looking it</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry ever again about your eyebrow pencil not been sharp enough to create a fine line.</li>
      <li>This pencil is great for filling in your brows using small short strokes but the size of the pencil is so thin, you have to be very careful and use a very light hand or the tip will break off.</li>
      <li>Sometimes I go darker with the color by pressing a little harder or re-penciling certain areas lightly.</li>
      <li>I plan to purchase another one in the very near future.</li>
      <li>My skin is very oily, so the other pencils just melt.</li>
      <li>This product goes on smooth, however it&#x27;s little too dark for me.</li>

<li> It is difficult to remove the sharpening end of the pencil and equally as difficult to sharpen it.  </li>
<li> and I will not buy it again as it is expensive</li>
<li> After paying this price I&#x27;m absolutely  annoyed and disappointed.</li>

    <li> I love my new spiked eye pencil</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure there are a lot of people who use and love this product, but it was just not what I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked MAC brow pencils because they are thin, have an automatic sharpener at the top as the pencil comes out (so it&#x27;s never thick or crayon-ish) and are so easy to hold and manuever. My eyebrows are sparse and thin naturally so I use mine everyday and it goes for 3 months (I usually but them in quantities of 2). It stays on pretty well in the shower (I don&#x27;t wash my face in the shower though) and while I sleep at night. I always give myself a touch up after though because obviously it&#x27;s not going to look exactly as it did when I first applied it. Sometimes I go darker with the color by pressing a little harder or re-penciling certain areas lightly. When I want my brows to be a softer, lighter brown; I apply less pencil and pressure.</li>
    <li> Received  this product today. I love mac but this particular item looked as tho it was used the tip of it was already gone. After paying this price I&#x27;m absolutely  annoyed and disappointed. The supplier could have done better than this. I so want my dam money back</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair but I don&#x27;t like to have my eyebrows look so dark which is why spiked its such a perfect color for me. I can&#x27;t get over how natural looking it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, a big part of what makes this eyebrow pencil so great its how thin the pencil is, which allows you to create the perfect shape for your brows You don&#x27;t have to worry ever again about your eyebrow pencil not been sharp enough to create a fine line.</li>
    <li> I used this pencil years ago when I first started doing my eyebrows. I only stopped using this pencil because of the price, but after years of trying to find a cheaper alternative, I have not found a replacement! I tried dark eye shadow, other pencils, eyebrow gel, eyebrow wax, and eyebrow powders. My skin is very oily, so the other pencils just melt. I use this pencil to trace my eyebrows; I do not use this pencil to fill in my eyebrows because it can look a bit harsh. I fill in my eyebrows with wax and then use a brow powder to seal my eyebrows. This pencil is expensive, but it is worth it!</li>
    <li> This pencil went on smooth and lasted all day. It filled in my eyebrows without looking overdone. I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this eyebrow pencil, easy to use, makes my eyebrows look natural. I have blonde eyebrows so need to darken and this does it without looking fake. Arrived quickly in the mail too.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for just about all hair colors. I change my hair color often and have found that this shade of color looks great with hair colors from blonde to burgandy and eveything in between. Definately would recommend to all my friends.</li>
    <li> At least for my tone and hair coloring. I wouldnt use anything else. This is perfect. It never dries out and always glides on smoothly. I sometimes use a brow brush just to smooth the edges but always great results with this product!</li>
    <li> It is difficult to remove the sharpening end of the pencil and equally as difficult to sharpen it.  I was looking forward to using it after I saw it used on a youtube video.  Somehow, I did not get the same results, much as I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Item was packaged well, it was recieved very quickly and when I did get it, it was exactly as described. Thanks a million.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted and I didnt have to leave my house to get it.  Great job for this product</li>
    <li> I love it an use it everyday!  I plan to purchase another one in the very near future.</li>
    <li> The MAC Eyebrow Pencil Spiked goes on smoothly and stays on until you take it off. My brows and eyes have never looked so good!</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil is worth it&#x27;s weight in GOLD! The end result is up to you. But the product itself makes the application priceless!!!</li>
    <li> This pencil is great for filling in your brows using small short strokes but the size of the pencil is so thin, you have to be very careful and use a very light hand or the tip will break off. The color is great and mostly universal for all medium and dark colored eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product goes on smooth, however it&#x27;s little too dark for me. I purchase eyebrow pencil for blondes to mix with this eyebrow pencil hopefully will lighten it up some.</li>
    <li> This eyebrow pencil is the BEST pencil I ever used.  Thank you MAC!!!</li>
    <li> This product is different from what I have used in the past.  It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be and I will not buy it again as it is expensive</li>
