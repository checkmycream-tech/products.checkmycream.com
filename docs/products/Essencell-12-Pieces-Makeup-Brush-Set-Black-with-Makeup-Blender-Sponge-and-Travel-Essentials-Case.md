<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is all you need. love them.</li>
    <li> I just received my brushes and I will start off with the positives, this is a nice set. Its packaged nicely the brushes feel good and having a wrap for the brushes is great! Heres my negative the fan brush LITERALLY fell apart once the plastic came off, I mean all the bristles out all over my table BUT I contacted Amazon and that they took care of making it right. Plus I really think it was accidental on the companys part who makes the brushes. It looks like the metal holding part wasnt stamped together. Again I&#x27;m sure accidental. Overall I like them and I will be ordering from them again so we&#x27;ll see if next time all the brushes can stay together.</li>
    <li> At first I was stand offish abut this product due to the offer code wasn&#x27;t working the first time I tried it. A little while longer the company sent me an email letting me know the offer code was working. So I took the chance and bought this product, and I have to say that I am glad that I did. There was great communication from the company as well as very good quality of material. I love the makeup sponges, now I don&#x27;t have to throw them away, just wash and reuse. I can&#x27;t wait till I get to experiment with more of the brushes. Also love the travel case they came in, great material.</li>
    <li> I ordered in black and they look very nice. The case is wonderful and holds all the brushes perfectly. They wash easily and dry quickly. The brushes are very soft and apply makeup nicely. And the blenders are a great pairing. Work wonderfully. No complaints at all, would happily purchase again.</li>
    <li> The sponges alone we worth the price of this kit. I love having everything brush I need in one bag and grab and go as needed.  I plan to buy a second set for my 20 year old daughter too. you just can not go wrong with this amazing set.</li>
    <li> My Essencell cosmetic kit came in today and right away I put it to use. I love how soft and firm the tips of each brush are. They came in a black pouch that it is soft as well and perfect to travel with the kit in my purse. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> These are really great brushes for the price. They are soft &amp; work great with my high end products! They are now a staple in my cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Love how soft this brushes are I have never owned a collection like this it is perfect for any occasion</li>
    <li> Ive been using these for over a month and i am loving them. These are very high quality like the professionals use and for a quarter of the cost. I love how theres literally a brush for everything. These are easy to hold and the brush heads are wonder. I have already cleaned them a coue times and they still look brand new. I use to buy thr cheap brushes from the store so whenever i used it the brush would shed the bristles all over my face and neck.  This set of brushes doesnt shed which is a huge plus. Also i love that it comes with a very nice case for them. It folds up so nicely and compact so its easy to store and easy to travel with. I have told all my friends about these and let them look at mine they are very jealous and are planning to buy their own set if they havent already.</li>
    <li> Got these on sale, some of the bigger brushes lost some bristles, but the blenders are wonderful along with the smaller brushes. Face powder brush and blush/bronzer brush were the only ones I didn&#x27;t care for but other than that a great set for beginners.</li>
    <li> Love it. Will order again. It looks a bit cheap specially the pink one, the black one looks nice, but they work as they supposed too.</li>
    <li> I Love these brushes! they are extra soft and the fallout is minimum. I Suggest that anyone who uses them CLEAN THEM when you get them! I have seen alot of reviews about them having alot of fallout but when you clean them any fallout that may occur happens then. Now that ive cleaned mine they no longer have any fallout. that is a makeup 101 tip!. Wash your brushes People!. Anyways after washing them i never had any fallout! Love the brushes, love the case! Omg the case is Gorgeous! and LOVE LOVE LOVE the blender balls that come with this set! Thank you Essencell!</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!!!!!! Im fascinated with my new set of brushes. I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Good quality and very soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also fast shipping</li>
    <li> I loved them first time using brushes and I am in love they are so soft and they are perfect so easy to clean and the case is so convenient to keep them in definitely a happy customer.</li>
    <li> Love This Brush Set!!! Super Soft brushes . High Quality product. the Beauty blenders work really well. Highly Recommend this product. I will be buying more products from them.</li>
    <li> Brushes are great feel so soft</li>
    <li> This is my first set of makeup brushes, but these brushes are so nice and soft! I wasnt sure exactly what brush was suppose to go with what makeup but the seller had sent me guide on how to use the brushes and what to use them with, which was soooo helpful. Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes a couple weeks ago and have been using them regularly. I&#x27;m always a bit skeptical about buying make up brushes online. I was pretty amazed at how soft all the brushes were when they arrived, and they hold us to the daily use very well. I also LOVE the leather case they came in. It&#x27;s nice and soft for traveling instead of stiff and plastic feeling like most cheaper sets of brushes give. I highly recommend buying!</li>
    <li> I love this brush set. This is perfect for whole makeup from starting to end. It has everything.&lt;br /&gt;Foundation brush, concealer brush, powder brush, blush brush, brow brush, lip brush etc.&lt;br /&gt;this is just perfect and quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect for people just getting into make-up, or anyone looking to expand their collection! They are soft with minor shedding. The sponges are a little on the dense side but do their job. The roll up case is great!</li>
    <li> Great! I loved them!  They were actually better than I had expected and the quality is awesome!</li>
    <li> The brushes and pouch stinks so bad...I left the brushes in water and shampoo for a 1 1/2 days and they still stink. The brushes shed and seem cheap, like I&#x27;m using paint brushes.</li>
    <li> It was a great bundle and includes everything I need for my whole face and even more, these pieces are currently all I use when I apply my makeup, the case was pretty and useful to keep them all in place, the packaging was also great, it wasn&#x27;t too bulky but it was big enough so that nothing got ruined or broken</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. Have not used them all yet but the ones I have work amazing with my makeup. I would recommend this to everyone!!</li>
    <li> Great deal! These brushes are awesome! Also love the blenders!</li>
    <li> Decent quality brushes. Made a nice addition to my collection. Not as fluffy as they could have been but the hair is soft and doesn&#x27;t shed as far as I can tell. The case does have that strong, distinctly plastic smell but that is my only complaint. Nice little surprise coupon in the bottom of the box, which,  by the way, is very sleek and stylish looking. Nice packaging and product presentation. The beauty blenders could have been individually wrapped to extend shelf life but eh, I&#x27;m being nit picky. Would make a lovely gift.</li>
    <li> By far the best makeup brushes ever. Great quality and they work like a gem. You get the package on time and have a great customer service. They send you email to help you with any of there products. I would definitely buy from them again. Highly satisfied</li>
    <li> The brushes arrived very fast, within two days of ordering. They are nicely packaged for gifting also. They come in a really nice soft rolled bag and each brush has its own slot which is great for space saving. They are well made and the bristles are firmly in place and stayed that way through application. There are varying sizes and a brush for just about everything. The sponges are great quality too.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so soft and just amazing to use.They come well wrapped in the holder and there is individual sections for each brush also so they don&#x27;t fall out when you unroll it.Excellent value for money and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this set, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I am in love! These brushes not only came in a super soft carrying case but these brushes are super soft as well! The range of brushes included is awesome and the two makeup sponges included was the icing on the cake!</li>
    <li> Right out the box the brushes look like they are really worth something and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out.  They come in a &amp;#34;leather&amp;#34; case which is a little flimsy, but I do like that it completely encases the brushes giving total protection for the brushes when not in use. I love the matte color on the brushes - a good clean look.  1st off, the sponges - they are amazing.  The feel is very comfortable in my hands, and I love the contours on them which help get every angle covered smoothly.  Two sponges are included and they work great for blending.  The angles make cleaning up little mistakes a breeze. The red sponge is soft, the tan a little firmer.  The brushes - there are so many to chose from!  The bristles in all the brushes are awesome!  They hold together and are a perfect length so they don&#x27;t fan out when used. They are a perfect combination of firmness and softness.  The eye makeup applicator is good.  It&#x27;s pretty close to what comes in a case of eye makeup, maybe a little nicer.  The long handle is a definite plus.  The foundation brush is nice and firm, yet soft enough to be very comfortable.  It spreads the powder foundation like a dream.  The eyeliner brush is very precise. I have contacts, and the bristles were so nice they didn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.  My old brush was constantly poking me with a lose strand.  Cleanup is a breeze.  They look like new after a quick cleaning.  After going through my test and liking this set so much, I let my mom try them out, she&#x27;s extremely picky about her makeup and was blown away.  She wants some of her own now!  We BOTH recommend these brushes for every level of experience.  I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, however, I do believe in being honest with my words.  These brushes are fantastic.</li>
    <li> These are the best makeup brushes I have ever owned! The company answered all of my questions promptly. Kudos to Kathy Sampson and Cindy Blessing!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush set for the price!</li>
    <li> I love it...got a great deal on them and they arrived on my door step in less then a week. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet but can&#x27;t wait to. I have looked and felt the brushes and they seem pretty smooth.</li>
    <li> I got a set of these black brushes when they were having a great promotion. They&#x27;re pretty good quality, especially for the price I paid, but just a warning, the bag/organizer they come in has an extremely strong chemical smell. I wiped it with a Clorox wipe a few times and let it sit out to dry, but it still reeks, so I&#x27;ll probably end up throwing it away. It hasn&#x27;t affected the brushes, though. AND this company seems to have really attentive customer service, and they&#x27;ll send you lots of very helpful tips on makeup application and how to use the brushes properly. I wouldn&#x27;t pay full price for this set, but if you catch it on sale, go for it!</li>
    <li> Whether you&#x27;re beginning to learn to experiment with makeup or you&#x27;re a pro, there are certain applicators that work best for each product and each area of the face. It&#x27;s evident that the creator of this product was well aware of that fact as well as twelve brushes and two beauty blenders are included for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set includes everything you could possibly need to apply your makeup : two beauty blenders, a powder brush, blush brush, lip and/or eyeliner brush, eyeshadow brush, blending brush, fan brush and several others and includes a nice carrying bag as well so it&#x27;s easy to carry the whole set or only pieces at a time, depending on the need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I love this set! Good variety of brushes. The quality of the brushes is great ! Customer service followed up twice regarding the care of the brushes via email. I appreciated their product care information packet included with the set.Great Price too !</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get to try the makeup brushes. i gave them to my mother. However the beauty blender sponges included with this set I did keep. I LOVEEEEE them!!! I so didn&#x27;t understand the craze over these things, until I received these. I had purchased a dupe from a different company a couple days before I received the Essencell sponges, and was highly disappointed. The other company&#x27;s sponges were hard and didn&#x27;t expand at all. The Essencell brands are AMAZING!! My highlight and powder goes on flawlessly! I will definitely be purchasing some more!  I included a picture the Essencell brand is on the right.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use after I did my professional make up course. The brushes are perfect and sponge are soft and nice. My make up look flawless I recommend this brand to anyone who desire flawless make up.</li>
    <li> Great for my daughter she is 15 and just learning about make up. Top quality and very well made.</li>
    <li> Brushes are soft and durable! Little case that comes with the brushes is great!!  The free blender sponges are awesome!!</li>
    <li> I just received these brushes 2 days ago and absolutely love them! The quality seems great and they come nicely packaged in a professional looking leather pouch. 2 beauty sponges are included. Have not used them yet but I&#x27;m sure they will be great. The leather pouch has a strong smell to it but I think that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s so new. I&#x27;m sure overtime it will fade away. Highly recommend! Can&#x27;t beat the price and quality!</li>
    <li> sadly,the 1st time i used the blush/foundation brush(es) they both immediately began to shed.pretty badly,i might add.i ended up just tossing them.haven&#x27;t used the fan brush.the smaller brushes were not nearly as bad as the larger ones.but,ya get what ya pay for &amp; for $7,that is kind of what i suspected i might get.lol the sponges are like any other.i don&#x27;t care for them,anyway (regardless of brand).this set might be okay for a young girl&#x27;s 1st set(as a starter),but if you do makeup,or are just a cosmetics&amp;brush junkie like i am-i would skip this one.if you&#x27;re looking for quality brushes that are budget friendly &amp; you&#x27;re not a brand snob-try b&amp;h-i swear by them! the reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 0 is bc the smaller brushes were alright,as were the sponges,&amp;the case is quite nice.</li>
    <li> As described. Good brushes.</li>
    <li> I use the beauty blenders every day. They don&#x27;t expand as much as I thought they would (maybe because I don&#x27;t soak them in water long enough?) but the application is perfect.  The brushes are all very soft and I love the magnetic clasps on the case. It&#x27;s very hassle-free as opposed to some other cases that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft but dense. The applications for products are very smooth and the brush does not shed much. I would advise to clean the brushes first before using them so eliminate some sheedding.</li>
    <li> These brushes and sponges are AMAZING!!!!!!!  They were true to description, soft to the touch and the price was a steal, they came in a great pouch too!!!  I&#x27;m in love with this purchase and on the look out for other Essencell products!!!</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this brush set...really liking the eyeshadow brushes..have yet to use the fan or foundation brush but will try to do so soon..about the one negative is I didn&#x27;t find the blush brush held the blush well and deposited much color on my cheeks so I will use another brush I own for that but overall can&#x27;t beat the price for what you get..the case is super cute too..great for travel!</li>
    <li> Their great an I love them</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this wonderful set of brushes! They are very soft and work wonderfully to help you get that perfect look you are trying to achieve the blenders are great also and are very handy when I have lines I just blend them out with out any issues. I love the carrying care it helps keep everything clean and together. If you are looking for a new set of brushed give these a try today!</li>
    <li> Pretty case and love the blenders</li>
    <li> These are really great brushes! Just make sure you follow the directions and wash them before use. They don&#x27;t shed or anything. The handy case make for easy travel.</li>
    <li> LOVE this set! All of the brushes are extremely soft and very high quality. The bag is so sleek!  This set is so cute and I&#x27;d definitely highly recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I got them as a gift from my friend. These brushes are very soft and dense. It is a fantastic set and easy to apply all type of make up!!!!!! I love these brushes and will highly recommend them to all of my friends who love make up!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> So digging these brushes.  They are wonderful.  They have a smell do to the packaging but I aired them out.</li>
    <li> For the price, these are decent brushes. The sponges were not very soft and definitely not comparable to higher end beauty sponges. I had to air these out for a while due to the chemically smell and I wound up throwing the case away. They shed a bit. Overall, these are good for expanding a kit or as backup brushes.</li>
