      <li>With continued use it imparted a more rosy hue and fuller look to my lips.  </li>

      <li>and I love the results.  </li>
      <li>Well, I could bite my lip and get more plumpness.</li>
      <li>and now I feel much better about my lips ...</li>
      <li>It is not a gloss, it is more of a treatment.  </li>
      <li>Through the years I have tried many lip plumpers from many companies and this is my favorite.</li>
      <li>Yes, it tastes good but the benefits are absolutely none!</li>
      <li>Wow pretty impressed.</li>
      <li>Lip stick does nothing but feels fresh and is a nice moisturizer for your lips.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>It has really good ingredients and that was the main reason I bought it </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s cute and small, perfect size for gettin in out of my cosmetic bag...</li>
      <li>It was fine to put on</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even want this product for free.</li>
      <li>Consumers Be aware This product  does not plump your lips!!</li>
      <li>Being a strong believer in organic herbs based cosmetics, i naturally choose this amazing item.</li>
      <li>I was so excited about this product-beyond belief.</li>
      <li>Ok, first off, there is nothing in there.</li>
      <li>This product promotes and advertises full lips.</li>
      <li>And now I don&#x27;t really ware lipstick any more .</li>
      <li>I really should have listened more to the reviews that were saying this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>Its texture feels good when spread on the lips, the reaction of plumper lips is visible after a short time,</li>
      <li>Next, I LOVED the minty flavor</li>
      <li>, the taste was pleasant, however there way no real improvement.</li>
      <li>It leaves my lips very plumped and glossy and gives that tingly sensation that proves that the lip plumper is doing it&#x27;s job!</li>
      <li>(I ran out of gum the other day and applied some after lunch and even got a comment for having good breathe...</li>
      <li>and you see results right away.</li>
      <li>the only good thing about this product is way it makes your lips feel...really soft.</li>
      <li>Compared to past experience with similar products.this one has been the best!</li>
      <li>First of all, I like the packaging</li>
      <li>It did absolutely nothing!  </li>
      <li>When I first got this, I didn&#x27;t feel as much initial sensation as I have experienced with other lip plumpers, so I had my doubts.  </li>
      <li>I relied on the positive comments that were on Amazon</li>
      <li>I read the reviews hoping that the people who spoke highly of it were right</li>
      <li>It made my lips super soft but did not plump my lips at all.</li>
      <li>But come on, it does not plump you lip or do anything really.</li>
      <li>This product really did nothing for me.</li>
      <li>Very affordable, and received my package in a timely manner.</li>
      <li>I can tell my lips are much fuller.</li>
      <li>It makes my lips soft and kissable!!!</li>
      <li>Seriously after reading these comments and looking for a good lip plumper for almost 2 weekw now... I decided to be THE DETERMINER....</li>
      <li>When you twirl the applicator all the way to the top to finally get a little bit in the brush, it does taste minty and sweet.</li>
      <li>Im sticking to my carmex if i want soft lips, so much cheaper...</li>
      <li>I was at least expecting a nice color to form after  the application ,nope</li>
      <li>i have new lip  </li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a very natural looking look.</li>
      <li>I would have appreciated a little more written information about the product, but I will definitely restock when I run out off this!</li>
      <li>The plumper goes on clear</li>
      <li>As far as plumping...absolutely nothing.</li>
      <li>if you with a doctor for some treatment, but it really makes your lips softer and look bigger.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be buying another tube when Summer comes around; highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I wondered if perhaps the product was old, but would not recommend buying this.</li>
      <li>And as far as plumping?</li>
      <li>I definitely recommend this product to any woman who wants to fulfill her lips,</li>
      <li>Well then you would need a new tube about every 3rd day.  </li>
      <li>I am so upset that I spent all this money and it would be too much of a hassle for me to return and deal with sending it back since I live in Chicago and commuting to a UPS store would take an 2 hours of my day.</li>
      <li>After using it, I feel a subtle difference and am overall pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>but only cause it made my lips soft.</li>
      <li>Nothing, no changes, no effect , wasted money, doesn&#x27;t worth those money.</li>
      <li>I generally use it in the morning and at bed time, this is enough to retain my results.  </li>
      <li>I could hardly contain my excitement when I finally received the Ultimate Smile Herbal Organic Injection Lip Plumper</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Somewhat worked, but make sure you buy 2 bottles to see results..</li>
    <li> This product really did nothing for me. I didn&#x27;t feel any &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; as mentioned, and it didn&#x27;t have any plumping effect. I wondered if perhaps the product was old, but would not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> I did not realized how excellently this product worked for me until I stopped using it!  With continued use it imparted a more rosy hue and fuller look to my lips.  It is not a gloss, it is more of a treatment.  I generally use it in the morning and at bed time, this is enough to retain my results.  A little goes a long way and relative to other lip plumpers it is very reasonably priced. Through the years I have tried many lip plumpers from many companies and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I tried this herbal lip plumper and used it at least twice a day til it ran out and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product,  is&#x27;t amazing.  The effect is quick and the lips become very beautiful  I bought 3 of them and don&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This lip plumper is great! It leaves my lips very plumped and glossy and gives that tingly sensation that proves that the lip plumper is doing it&#x27;s job! I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks, and I even got some compliment and questions about what I&#x27;m wearing on my lips. I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> Ok, first off, there is nothing in there. When you twirl the applicator all the way to the top to finally get a little bit in the brush, it does taste minty and sweet. But come on, it does not plump you lip or do anything really. Not even a good chap treatment. Its like you put sugar on your lips. Yes, it tastes good but the benefits are absolutely none!</li>
    <li> I have used many lip plumbers before and this is by FAR the best one! I use it daily and you see results right away. The product arrived within days. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I think you might of giving me the teeth whitening paste because it does not have a gloss at all to it it&#x27;s drys on my lips with a toothpaste feel. No gloss what so ever</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for a few days and it does nothing. There is no tingling and no sensation whatsoever. The product feels like a gel that they added mint flavoring to. I relied on the positive comments that were on Amazon and I ended up buying a fraud. This product doesn&#x27;t work, but it does dry your lips. I wish they offered some sort of guarantee because I would be returning this product asap!</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I didn&#x27;t feel as much initial sensation as I have experienced with other lip plumpers, so I had my doubts.  I have been using it for a few weeks now and I love the results.  After using it, I feel a subtle difference and am overall pleased with my purchase.  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an organic lip plumper.</li>
    <li> Saw results immediately! Tingly, and it helps that it&#x27;s flavored mint! The plumper goes on clear so it&#x27;s a very natural looking look. Very affordable, and received my package in a timely manner. Will definitely be buying another tube when Summer comes around; highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This product did not meet my expectations and it was basically a waste of money.  There were no visible results.</li>
    <li> the only good thing about this product is way it makes your lips feel...really soft. As far as plumping...absolutely nothing. Im sticking to my carmex if i want soft lips, so much cheaper...</li>
    <li> This product literally lasted me three days before it had no more product left and I had to throw it out. Does not even deserve a star</li>
    <li> Nothing, no changes, no effect , wasted money, doesn&#x27;t worth those money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend. My advice is not to buy.</li>
    <li> I hardly use it but when I do it works great. Would definitely recommend it. Just use it all the time.</li>
    <li> This product feels good on my lips but the plumper does not work.  Not a noticeable difference if at all.</li>
    <li> Wow pretty impressed. Looks like I got a lip job! Doesn&#x27;t give you that burning sensation and &amp;#34;chapped lip&amp;#34; look that the other lip plump products do. This is one product that does what it says it will do. I will be buying more for maintenance purposes!</li>
    <li> The lip plumber is great product,&lt;br /&gt;The lip plumber is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;i will recommend it to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;Hanita</li>
    <li> Great product!  It does everything they advertise it will do.  I love it!  I would have appreciated a little more written information about the product, but I will definitely restock when I run out off this!</li>
    <li> I could hardly contain my excitement when I finally received the Ultimate Smile Herbal Organic Injection Lip Plumper It makes my lips soft and kissable!!! TO-DIE-FOR. The consistency of the Lip Plumper is lightweight, mostly non-sticky, is very comfortable to wear. This is some really good stuff, and I love the way they packaged it….. It’s very easy to find when I look for it in my purse. It has really good ingredients and that was the main reason I bought it </li>
    <li> Seriously after reading these comments and looking for a good lip plumper for almost 2 weekw now... I decided to be THE DETERMINER.... when I see mixed reviews for products I immediately do 2 things that I always do: BUY IT &amp; TRY IT !!!! So let me give all of you the low down on this s***. First of all, I like the packaging, it&#x27;s cute and small, perfect size for gettin in out of my cosmetic bag... Next, I LOVED the minty flavor (I ran out of gum the other day and applied some after lunch and even got a comment for having good breathe... GO FIGURE! lol) After about a week, I started to see the results but the problem is that it is a gradual process for all of you looking for instant results....    ANYWAYS, I GIVE THIS PRODUCT AN OVERRALL 5 STARS , NO MATTER WHAT OPINIONS ALL OF YOU MAY HAVE :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve using this product for a while and of course it doesn&#x27;t work as if you with a doctor for some treatment, but it really makes your lips softer and look bigger. I do recomend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of weeks ago and I was very disappointed. It made my lips super soft but did not plump my lips at all. I have a very small upper lip and was hoping that it would plump it so that my lips would look a little fuller. But this product didn&#x27;t even plump them at all. I would not recommend anyone to buy this product. I read the reviews hoping that the people who spoke highly of it were right but unfortunately they weren&#x27;t. I really should have listened more to the reviews that were saying this product doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m gonna give it one star but only cause it made my lips soft. But seriously people if you are looking for something to actually plump your lips DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all for me.  It was fine to put on, the taste was pleasant, however there way no real improvement.</li>
    <li> This product promotes and advertises full lips. Lip stick does nothing but feels fresh and is a nice moisturizer for your lips.&lt;br /&gt; I was at least expecting a nice color to form after  the application ,nope no color ither. Consumers Be aware This product  does not plump your lips!! If you want plump lips get Neo Strata Anti-Wrinkle Lip Enhancer or get a juvederm Needle injection.</li>
    <li> Tried everyday several times a day for one week ...by the way ....not much product left after one week. It did absolutely nothing!  What a ripoff ! I wouldn&#x27;t even want this product for free. I have no reason to lie...please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This product will need to be applied several times a day to evoke the best results. Try it and see.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week. Being a strong believer in organic herbs based cosmetics, i naturally choose this amazing item. Its texture feels good when spread on the lips, the reaction of plumper lips is visible after a short time, Compared to past experience with similar products.this one has been the best!</li>
    <li> The instructions say to use the product up ~8 times a day???  Well then you would need a new tube about every 3rd day.  After applying it leaves my lips dry, not soft.  And as far as plumping? Well, I could bite my lip and get more plumpness.</li>
    <li> I had to return it- it does not work. Tastes and feels like a toothpaste on you lips- that&#x27;s it! Seriously!</li>
    <li> great product i recomand i have new lip  so plummmmm so nice love it i will order another one to cary in my bag all day thank you&lt;br /&gt; Talila</li>
    <li> I was so excited about this product-beyond belief. That is until I took it out of the box and tried to put it on my lips. I tried to rotate the top of it to get product out of the tube and nothing would come out.  I continued to rotate and nothing .Then I took it to my Fiance to see if I was doing something wrong. But He said it is defective because the rotator inside was not working. I am so upset that I spent all this money and it would be too much of a hassle for me to return and deal with sending it back since I live in Chicago and commuting to a UPS store would take an 2 hours of my day. What a poorly made product. By the way I just received it and this was my first attempt to use it :(</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. expensive lip gloss</li>
    <li> At the beginning I was not sure if this product is doing its thing . I did not feel stinging or burning at all , although it has the warning .&lt;br /&gt;I have been using for about few weeks and now I feel much better about my lips ...takes a while for me to realize but I think not have to go through stinging or something like burning is a good thing . And now I don&#x27;t really ware lipstick any more .</li>
    <li> I love this product! I can tell my lips are much fuller.I definitely recommend this product to any woman who wants to fulfill her lips,</li>
</ol>
