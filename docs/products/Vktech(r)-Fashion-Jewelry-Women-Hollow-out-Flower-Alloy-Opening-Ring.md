    <li> it was bent when I received it and it was just horrible!</li>
    <li> it broke within hours of me putting it on! Very pretty but cheaply made.</li>
    <li> This item shipped very quickly, and I got it well before the estimated delivery date. It was super adorable and it fit well, however the 2nd time I wore it, I went to pinch it together (gently because it was already on my finger) to tighten it and I heard a snapping noise. I looked down and it had broken in half. It was some kind of plastic material. Had this been any type of metal it would have gotten 5 stars from me. It was super cute!</li>
    <li> I really like this. Its sturdier than I thought it was going to be</li>
    <li> Too long for my fingers can not bend my knuckle. Don&#x27;t have very long fingers but still expected to be able to wear it on one of my fingers</li>
    <li> Horrible. Too small and cheap.</li>
    <li> very cute but pinches in back of my finger I gave it to my daughter and it happened to her too so its just sitting in my jewelry box with nobody wearing it</li>
    <li> Ring arrived early, but not in perfect shape. I was originally unhappy with my purchase. I voiced my opinion with Vktech and they were able to refund the total purchase. I gave 5 stars for handling my issues so quickly. Thank you again</li>
    <li> Nice buy not what I expected looks better on the model but was worth a try</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with this ring. It pokes and scratches my finger and I have a hard time adjusting it. I do like the flower pattern but its too cheap and marks my fingers up. My husband would have to grind the edges a bit before I can wear it anyway. Good for costume jewelry or dress up for a little girl...</li>
    <li> I like this ring and it is a great bold hand accessorie.</li>
    <li> It is uncomfortable below  but I liked</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay ring. It looks way better in picture than it does in person. It came in broken the first time so they had to send me a new one. It isn&#x27;t the best choice for a ring. It&#x27;s meant for longer fingers as well</li>
    <li> very cheap  and metal is sharp</li>

    <li> Cheaply made. Way too big.</li>

    <li> i love this ring so much</li>
    <li> The ring is okay. The fit in the picture looks better. I had difficulty getting it on and off by adjusting it which bent it out of shape.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cute. The edges are rough.</li>
    <li> I  love this ring. It fits perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Paulina.</li>
    <li> Love it but pinches my finger badly!!! Sucks</li>
    <li> Broke the same day I got it</li>

    <li> The ring is very cute, however it did not have a RING to put my fingers through. It would of been perfect except for the fact that it is half a ring!... I will not recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This Is A Nice piece I Get Alot Of Compliments!!! Goes With Just about Everything I Wear!!! Love It!!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it not worth it!&lt;br /&gt;Sharp edges &amp; misshaped on both ends. Horrible can&#x27;t wear, will never buy from them again!&lt;br /&gt;Had to give one star or it would not place my review!</li>
