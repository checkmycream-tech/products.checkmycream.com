      <li>I love this lotion.  </li>

      <li>:))</li>
      <li>and I love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>having your dermatologist burn many spots on your body with liquid nitrogen.</li>
      <li>It tingles but it is completely safe.  </li>
      <li>My dermatologist from Thomas Jefferson Hospital recommended this lotion many years ago.  </li>
      <li>It is an excellent moisturizer with several added benefits.  </li>
      <li>Love what its done for me.</li>
      <li>Within  a week of using this lotion 2x a day and scrubbing with a Japanese cloth my legs are completely smooth and beautiful!</li>
      <li>My wife and I have used this stuff for years and it works great in keeping your face clear of blemishes.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much, I bought the face products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other creams with acid, but this is the best one.</li>
      <li>The texture is soft and smooth and the appearance is almost 90% better!!  </li>
      <li>NeoStrata acts as an exfolient and does reduce fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>It makes you oddly shiny, so it&#x27;s not the best day time moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more economical...</li>
      <li>For about 4 years I use it several times a week with great results.</li>
      <li>Almost wrinkle free, even skin tone, smooth, bright and clear.  </li>
      <li>Makeup application is super easy.  </li>
      <li>I was really excited about the product after  </li>
      <li>I love this lotion as much as the Aqua Glycolic lotion that I also have been buying for Years!  </li>
      <li>thanks, neostrata :)</li>
      <li>work really well, love it</li>
      <li>As for my scars, they look and feel slightly better, however, my oily face doesn&#x27;t like this lotion too much.</li>
      <li>This lotion leads to more rapid cell production and causes older skin to slough off</li>
      <li>Neostrata 15 softens the appearance of deep laugh lines and wrinkles, and keeps you looking like your healthy self - skip the botox, fillers and surgery imho :).</li>
      <li>good product (long use)</li>
      <li>This is not for the first time glycolic user!</li>
      <li>does a great job of removing dead skin cells and moisturizing your face.</li>
      <li>Many years ago I saw an obviously old woman in a health food store.</li>
      <li>over many years have found no other products to compare!</li>
      <li>I was looking for a moisturizer, and this is not the right product.</li>
      <li>It has made my skin smoother and seems to clean out pours very well.</li>
      <li>He sold me my first bottle, now I buy it on line.</li>
      <li>I only use it once a week (because of cost) with no product on top of it.  </li>
      <li>This item is exactly what I wanted, I have been searching for it for some time.</li>
      <li>The 15 prepares your skin for higher AHA, but I believe the stronger versions are at the dermotologist.  </li>
      <li>This lotion was first recommended tome at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  </li>
      <li>doctor&#x27;s office, at a much higher cost,  If this really is the same, it works like magic on Keratosis, and will save you&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
      <li>have oily skin, and have always had large pores with lots of blackheads on my nose and chin.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for rough dry calloused skin.  </li>
      <li>I have mixed feelings about this one, but that&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m not using it for its primary purpose -- anti-aging -- but to smooth out small acne scars.</li>
      <li>I really like it, and will order it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not bothered much by this.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this lotion and am seeing a difference in my skin after a month of usage.</li>
      <li>Shipped really fast.</li>
      <li>This bottle keeps its shape as opposed to the pump model where the pump bottle caves in and is very unsightly.  </li>
      <li>No need to spend hundreds, this is the real mccoy</li>
      <li>My ongoing fight against blackheads on my nose and (some) on my forehead is OVER thanks to the NeoStrata Lotion.  </li>
      <li>This product really works.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff - half as much as you would pay in a doctor&#x27;s office!  </li>
      <li>But I use several other good products so maybe it does work.</li>
      <li>When I got the product I used the first night and went to bed, next morning I had the most surprising results from this product, smooth skin like a velvet free of any lumps, however, the followed days my skin just came back the same rough skin as usual.</li>
      <li>My face is much less wrinkled than most women who are 68.</li>
      <li>Have not started this particular bottle as yet, but have purchased a bottle from</li>
      <li>I had high hopes that this product would be my salvation after reading the reviews...</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I used a Jason AHA product for 20 years and thought I&#x27;d never change, but Jason stopped making the my product.  Hope NeoStrata plans on keeping this AHA 15 around for another 20.</li>
    <li> This is not for the first time glycolic user! My face is used to some intense products, only turning a little red with Retin-A, but this gives a little sting almost every time I use it. The bonus is that my face does not redden at all. It is helping to keep my face clear, and my skin has really smoothed and softened after a month of use.I use it alone at night after cleansing, and in the morning I just add some sunscreen after I apply it. I really like it, and will order it again. You have to use such a small amount though, it will be awhile before I need to reorder. This is a great value compared to other face lotions I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> This product stings my face.  Does not do what it claims.  No information on how to return product.</li>
    <li> The bottle press doesn&#x27;t allow air intake, which means the more lotion you squeeze out, the more distorted the container will be. Because It&#x27;s odd that such a good product comes with bad bottle design.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 20 years- in my 70&#x27;s now and still not wrinkled! No need to spend hundreds, this is the real mccoy</li>
    <li> Great value for the cost.  I use it to keep alligator legs at bay.  I only use it once a week (because of cost) with no product on top of it.  The rest of the week I use other, less expensive moisturizers.  This lotion leads to more rapid cell production and causes older skin to slough off (thus the stinging noted by another reviewer).</li>
    <li> My wife and I have used this stuff for years and it works great in keeping your face clear of blemishes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s more economical...</li>
    <li> This product at 15aha strength is the best for olive skin, I would suggest a lower strength like 10aha for fairer complexions.  At near 70 years old, this product is still holding off facial wrinkles and dark spotting, and on the hands and arms, would you believe no crepey skin or sun spots.....over many years have found no other products to compare!</li>
    <li> Works great but be careful because it does sting a little if your skin is sensitive. I also use the foam cleanser but do not get a reaction from it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 weeks now, once a day, usually in the morning.  My skin is glowing and I&#x27;ve been getting tons of compliments.  :)</li>
    <li> But I use several other good products so maybe it does work. I usually use it at night and occasionally skip a night because it does sting when applied. No redness however which is good</li>
    <li> I love it ... Skin is smooth !</li>
    <li> When I got this I used it once a day, and I didn&#x27;t see any improvement at all. Then I started using it twice a day and I saw a big decrease in my KP. I&#x27;ve been using this for more than 4 months now and I still have KP, but not as bad as before. I feel like I have to find some other product to remove the KP scars/marks, and possibly increasing the usage of this to 3 times a day and see if it&#x27;ll finally get rid of all my KPs.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about the product after  I read some reviews. When I got the product I used the first night and went to bed, next morning I had the most surprising results from this product, smooth skin like a velvet free of any lumps, however, the followed days my skin just came back the same rough skin as usual. I am still using the product even I know my skin is the same. No more velvet skin or nothing. I do have Keratosis, I bought this product believing in the reviews that I got from people with the same skin condition than mine. I used on my face also to try to take off some dark spot from sun, it didn&#x27;t work yet.So I don&#x27;t like this product because did not do anything for me. I feel I thrown money away.</li>
    <li> I have used the NeeoStrata Lotion plus AHA for years.  I am 67 years old, and I am always getting compliments on my skin.  It contains glycolic acid, which promotes exfoliation and smaller pores.  I apply it every night, and my skin looks 10-15 years younger than my age.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes skin look great.</li>
    <li> I have been using NeoStrata for about 25 years (I&#x27;m guessing). I am a 73 year old woman who does not have brown spots on my body. I swim every day. The only answer that I can give when people comment on my skin is that .....it is the Neostrata skin smoothing lotion. I use it on my arms and legs. My daughter uses it on arms, legs and face. We LOVE it!!!</li>
    <li> Dermatologist recommended...love this product, not oily or greasy.  I use it after every shower as a body moisturizer..  My skin is SOFT,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone to so many dermatologist over the past few years for my skin.  The top of my legs have the appearance of snake like skin, I&#x27;ve tried everything you could imagine.  Someone recommended this to me and in a matter of 2-3 weeks, my legs dramatically improved.  The texture is soft and smooth and the appearance is almost 90% better!!  I&#x27;m amazed and will never stop using this stuff.  I loved it so much, I bought the face products.  If it has done wonders for my legs, i could only image what it will do for my face!!</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this one, but that&#x27;s mostly because I&#x27;m not using it for its primary purpose -- anti-aging -- but to smooth out small acne scars. I purchased it from an online shop due to shipping costs. As for my scars, they look and feel slightly better, however, my oily face doesn&#x27;t like this lotion too much. I should probably have gone for a lighter formulation. My mother uses this and she likes it. I switched to using it on my legs, as they have some hyperpigmentation on them. They&#x27;re silky smooth, but I&#x27;m not sure anything else is changing.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I saw an obviously old woman in a health food store. I was struck by her amazing skin, and asked her what she used.&lt;br /&gt;This was the product she used, and I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I could only find it at an out of the way pharmacy, so stopped using it for convenience.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I had stuck with it because my skin is not happy.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is starting to look clearer (I don&#x27;t have breakouts, just duller skin).&lt;br /&gt;With the ease of ordering it, I will continue on this path!</li>
    <li> I have been using Neostrata 15AHA for 20+ years now using the same face wash...same face lotion every morning and night. At 51....my face apears years younger. Would&#x27;nt and could&#x27;nt go without it. Love what its done for me.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist from Thomas Jefferson Hospital recommended this lotion many years ago.  The formula has changed very little but it continues to be one of the best things you can use on your skin.  I&#x27;m 60 but my complexion looks like a 30yr old!  Almost wrinkle free, even skin tone, smooth, bright and clear.  Nothing keeps you skin looking better!</li>
    <li> does a great job of removing dead skin cells and moisturizing your face. Start with once a day and then maybe twice. Product does burn a little the first few times you use it!</li>
    <li> This product is great for rough dry calloused skin.  If you want baby soft skin, this is the lotion to use.  It won&#x27;t disappoint you!!</li>
    <li> You can FEEL it working. I use Obagi  Skin care line for my face and needed something for the rest of my body.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion as much as the Aqua Glycolic lotion that I also have been buying for Years!  Both were recommended to me by my dermatologist, and I&#x27;ve been using one-or-the-other, ever since~!  I do wear sunscreen as well, because neither of these products contain it.  Suggestion:  A Little Goes a Long Way!  Or, a little dab of this will do it!  If your skin is sensitive, you&#x27;d probably just want to use it a couple of times a week.  I use it daily because after years of using it, I have no sensitivity to it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 15 years, based on a doctor&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
    <li> OH! this is an awesome product to exfoliate your whole body. My Dermatologist sells it in her office. Amazon.com has the best price.:))</li>
    <li> I am 66 years old ..I look like I am in my forty .I have use this twice a day ....every morning and every night for 36 years with out fail..I have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;people stop and tell me how beautiful my skin looks ...I have sold this to about 100 people just buy my radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you NeoStrata ...</li>
    <li> The best lotion for problem skin</li>
    <li> I am a 15 year regular user of this product, and that is an indication of my devotion.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and my mom loved it. Shipped really fast.</li>
    <li> This is a Great product, recommended by a dermatologist.  He sold me my first bottle, now I buy it on line.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer, and this is not the right product. It has made my skin smoother and seems to clean out pours very well. Probably will not re-order, but I suggest you try it and make your own decision. What I would really love to find is a moisturizing cream LaCosta CC&#x27;s spa used to sell. It is the best moisturizing lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion and am seeing a difference in my skin after a month of usage.</li>
    <li> I have had extremely dry, scaly, flaky skin all of my life and NeoStrata Lotion helped me. I no longer have the discomfort of itchy scaly legs. And the appearance of my skin is &amp;#34;normal Looking&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m thrilled !!</li>
    <li> I like this product. you put it on and then you use shower gloves a few days later and your skin has a newer layer of skin that looks better.</li>
    <li> Have not started this particular bottle as yet, but have purchased a bottle from&lt;br /&gt;my doctor&#x27;s office, at a much higher cost,  If this really is the same, it works like magic on Keratosis, and will save you&lt;br /&gt;from having your dermatologist burn many spots on your body with liquid nitrogen.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes that this product would be my salvation after reading the reviews...but I&#x27;ve seen no difference in my skin tone or texture...I tried amlactin before NeoStrata, and that was worse (smelly, useless goop). So it&#x27;s back to the drawing board...there must be a product out there that isn&#x27;t hit or miss...</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My dermatologist recommended it about 5 years ago, I&#x27;ve been using it&#x27;s since (I&#x27;m 26). It takes a while to adjust to the AHA, so be careful not to slather your face with a thick layer the first time. I just bought this larger size to use my body, especially my legs. I had really dry flaky skin on my legs... Within  a week of using this lotion 2x a day and scrubbing with a Japanese cloth my legs are completely smooth and beautiful! This size and price is a great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used NeoStrata AHA for several years.  My face is much less wrinkled than most women who are 68.</li>
    <li> good product (long use)</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years. Love it. Could not believe the price at Amazon. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great for skin. Use it all over. Especially dry skin. It works as exfoliate. Great for feet. Prevent calluses. Do not get in eyes or use after you have exfoliated your skin or used microdermabrasion</li>
    <li> This product really works. It was reccommended to me by a dermotologist. NeoStrata acts as an exfolient and does reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It also helps with the little skin tags we sometimes get on our faces necks, ad chest.</li>
    <li> This lotion was first recommended tome at my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  It is an excellent moisturizer with several added benefits.  Now I can buy it online for less than my doctor charged.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> A dermatologist recommended this to me to help with dry and flakey skin.  For about 4 years I use it several times a week with great results.</li>
    <li> This leaves your skin dry &amp; not lumenescent like the other neo strata aha lotion. Tingles must work, but your skin does not look smoother afterwards.</li>
    <li> This bottle keeps its shape as opposed to the pump model where the pump bottle caves in and is very unsightly.  The plastic is heavier and somewhat hard to use in dispensing the lotion if arthritic hands are an issue.  I have used this product for years and love it!</li>
    <li> it is a good product, but it doesn´t works for keratosis. This is the second time I buy this product expecting a different reaction.</li>
    <li> If you were a sunbather, have dry skin or mature skin, try this NeoStrata 15.  Goes on more like a gel and will make your skin silky, will plump up small lines and evens tone.  Your skin will improve with use.  Put it on your extremities and face every night and it works overnight.  When it is hot might be too thick for day, but use overnight.  Great in cooler weather all day as it coats.  This works better on smoothing than anything over the counter.  It tingles but it is completely safe.  The 15 prepares your skin for higher AHA, but I believe the stronger versions are at the dermotologist.  Neostrata 15 softens the appearance of deep laugh lines and wrinkles, and keeps you looking like your healthy self - skip the botox, fillers and surgery imho :).</li>
    <li> Along with their other products and program it works well.  You us this AHA 15 after you finish all of the AHA 10</li>
    <li> This item is exactly what I wanted, I have been searching for it for some time.</li>
    <li> Not the external package, but the box for this product is damaged. The lotion spilt over the bottle and made me don&#x27;t wanna try it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I purchased this lotion after receiving a sample from a make up purchase.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks now and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, and have always had large pores with lots of blackheads on my nose and chin.  After I had my son, I developed cystic acne on my face and back especially around my period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is wonderful.  I only use it once a day (at night), but over the last three weeks, my cystic acne has been drastically reduced and has disappeared from my face, with only one or two left on my back.  It is helping to fade the remaining marks.  My pores are noticeably smaller, and the blackheads on my nose and chin are gone.  If I wear make up, you can&#x27;t see my pores at all!  The texture of my skin is amazing, it&#x27;s very smooth and even.  Makeup application is super easy.  Best of all, it has reduced how oily my skin is on a day to day basis.  My makeup lasts longer, and I am not shiny at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can burn/ tingle a bit after application.  This has gotten less annoying as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey, but a little goes a long way!  I think this bottle will last 4+ months.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to use 2x per day.  It makes you oddly shiny, so it&#x27;s not the best day time moisturizer.  I get good results just using it nightly though, s I&#x27;m not bothered much by this.&lt;br /&gt;It does increase your sensitivity to the sun, so a moisturizer with SPF is needed for day.  I live in a very sunny climate, so I&#x27;m not sure how my skin will fare in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very, very pleased!</li>
    <li> Have used it for years. My ex-wife turned me on to it. I&#x27;ve tried other creams with acid, but this is the best one.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - half as much as you would pay in a doctor&#x27;s office!  I have purchased several so far.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had keratosis piliaris all my life and thought i didn&#x27;t stand a chance to have clear skin EVER.  surprise, surprise!  i can now bare my arms not worried that someone will touch it and cringe.  thanks, neostrata :)</li>
    <li> work really well, love it</li>
    <li> This is a great product.</li>
    <li> This product has brought amazing results for me.  I have always had problem skin -- even now in my 60&#x27;s, which is frustrating.  My daughter began using this lotion, had good results, and recommended it to me.  I followed directions, took it slow, but still found some improvement within 2 weeks.  Now several months later, the improvement continues and my skin clarity and softness is at a level I never thought possible.  My ongoing fight against blackheads on my nose and (some) on my forehead is OVER thanks to the NeoStrata Lotion.  Happy, happy, happy.</li>
