### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll try my best to explain it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>After styling it, it looked perfect.</li>
      <li>I have ordered a wig just like the one pictured awhile ago, and it was perfect.</li>
      <li>Perfect!</li>
      <li>Very nice quality and heat resistant.!</li>
      <li>Very good quality for the price.</li>
      <li>For the price I think it is very good quality.</li>
      <li>its a great wig but</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s good..</li>
      <li>if you want some good quality Buy this wig</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s always good.</li>
      <li>My mom laughed at me..</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but it was nice quality</li>
      <li>This is not that big of a problem, I can just cut and restyle the wig, but I thought it might be good for others to know.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the wig is great!</li>
      <li>Pretty good wig, great quality and cheap.</li>
      <li>I just needed to style it a bit since it was kind of long, but it&#x27;s a great wig for the price!</li>
      <li>I bought a wig that was maybe a dollar or two more</li>
      <li>I also straightened it easily with a curling iron.</li>
      <li>, it has a good color, and made of high quality materials.</li>
      <li>But fits well and is comfortable.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit well or look as described.</li>
      <li>But its so soft and has a ver y good quality.</li>
      <li>Good for price, but it wasnt as the the one showed on the picture, it was so short.</li>
      <li>i was really nervous buying this, i was buying it for Izaya orihara and honestly, i love it.</li>
      <li>This arrived quite quickly.</li>
      <li>when i first opened the package i almost cried because i though it wouldn&#x27;t fit me, but it turns out it did.</li>
      <li>First thing I have to warn is that mine did not look anything like the picture!</li>
      <li>The only good thing about it is that it feels like real hair.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the proper color, soft, and has great coverage.</li>
      <li>This wig is quite small if you have a large head and the hair quality isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
      <li>could see right through the fibers at the top.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I do think it could possibly work for others, as it is not terrible.</li>
      <li>First of all, it took over a month to receive.</li>
      <li>Second of all, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I tried it did not look like the picture.</li>
      <li>This wig was exactly what I was looking for to finish my Izaya Orihara cosplay.</li>
      <li>i would buy this again, and im a beginner to cosplay and this looks pretty quality for the price.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture that would require a bit of styling.</li>
      <li>Turns out my old wig is much better than this new one.</li>
      <li>Looks pretty much like the picture.</li>
      <li>However, the wig is very realistic and not at all too shiny.</li>
      <li>/&gt;While I didn&#x27;t expect much from a cheap wig, it even missed my already low expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My son used it for Izaya cosplay and it looked like his real hair.</li>
      <li>It looks absolutely nothing like the picture.</li>
      <li>I understood at the price it was it might be a bit off in real life, but not this much.</li>
      <li>Would be better but it is just too black for my skin-tone.</li>
      <li>It does have a realistic look though.</li>
      <li>but the wig looks like me REAL hair, its not overly shinny and it is SO soft.</li>
      <li>the one on the left is my old wig and the one on the right is the new one.</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for to complete my cosplay!</li>
      <li>If you want your hair to be predominately flat, close to the head, or straight down, then its fine.</li>
      <li>It looks like natural hair, and people thought I cut my hair because of it.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s gotten old and I wanted to replace it, so I ordered this one.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s long all over and looks choppy in a few spots, the bangs cover my whole face, and it&#x27;s a good 4</li>
      <li>would say that it&#x27;s definitely possible to get the wig to look the same way in the picture, with some styling, but of course, when it first comes in the mail, it does not look like that.</li>
      <li>Just too small for me because I have a huge ass head.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking to style it later on, I wouldnt recommend it because since its thin and slightly short, there isn&#x27;t too much to style, if you want some hairs to stick out more.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It felt as if it was far smaller than normal.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Juuuust barely fits my head, but it works.</li>
      <li>It was way too short, almost completely unstylable, and smaller</li>
      <li>For masculine styles you&#x27;ll probably want to make it a little more rough - and less like a Beetles haircut -- with some gel or spray.</li>
      <li>This wig is super short, and it can&#x27;t be styled no matter how hard I tried.</li>

<li> This wig is super short, and it can&#x27;t be styled no matter how hard I tried.</li>
<li> Like seriously the wig is so short in comparison to the picture the seller used to  the item and my old wig, you can&#x27;t really tell in the pictures.</li>
<li> The front is way too long (almost cover to my nose) and the back is too short.</li>
<li> Plus it arrived earlier than expected</li>
<li> It was also a little short</li>
<li> TOO SHORT, NOT EVEN BLACK ITS DARK BROWN.  </li>
<li> Like other people have said it came a lot shorter than it should have.</li>
<li> Item is too small for my teenage daughter.</li>
<li> I ordered this wig for an Izaya Cosplay and was extremely dissappointed.</li>
<li> The fibers are very stiff and coarse.</li>
<li> The downsides is that it gave me a dark brown instead of black</li>
<li> I would not recommend buying the black wig.</li>
<li> Maybe cut it a little bit.</li>
<li> WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.</li>
<li> Waste of money</li>
<li> The wig is a bit thin and small (for me, but I have a larger head and long thick hair).</li>
<li> It&#x27;s like half the length of the hair in the picture consider I have a small head.</li>
<li> This wig was a little small</li>
<li> The base of the wig is way too small for me (and I&#x27;m a petite individual; I wear CHILDREN&#x27;S hats), and the wig fibers are really short, and cannot be styled to look even remotely like the wig in the picture.</li>
<li> the only things that are wrong with it is that it doesn&#x27;t look the way it does in that picture and part of the hair on the side sticks output styling it fixes all that</li>
<li> Isn&#x27;t anything like the picture :/</li>
<li> What a waste !</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to get the wig to stay and look like it does in the picture, perhaps I have to use product to modify the wig.</li>
<li> I had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
<li> The wig was small as well as not great quality...</li>
<li> i just received the wig in the mail today and it&#x27;s not good.</li>
<li> It way too small and weird shaped, do NOT look like what&#x27;s on the picture at all.</li>
<li> sorry I even bothered to buy it.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s shiny and fake looking.</li>
<li> Once out of the bag, I could immediately see the wig was of bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
<li> I was disappointed with this item.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
<li> Terrible wig, terrible purchase.</li>
<li> Disappointed!!!!</li>
<li> Wig came in awful shape and looks nothing like the picture.</li>

    <li> Juuuust barely fits my head, but it works. Keep in mind the wig comes unstyled so it will not look like it does in the picture.</li>
    <li> The wig was small as well as not great quality... I had high expectations, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
    <li> My mom laughed at me..I don&#x27;t care I like it</li>
    <li> Like other people have said it came a lot shorter than it should have. But I&#x27;ll find a way to do my Hiro Hamada Cosplay with it.</li>
    <li> Pretty good wig, great quality and cheap.</li>
    <li> This wig was exactly what I was looking for to finish my Izaya Orihara cosplay. After styling it, it looked perfect. Plus it arrived earlier than expected so that&#x27;s always good.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit well or look as described.</li>
    <li> Would be better but it is just too black for my skin-tone. But fits well and is comfortable. Looks pretty much like the picture.</li>
    <li> SCAM!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS&lt;br /&gt;The hair is incredibly short. It&#x27;s like half the length of the hair in the picture consider I have a small head. I don&#x27;t know why amazon let this continue to happened.</li>
    <li> Once out of the bag, I could immediately see the wig was of bad quality.&lt;br /&gt;You could see right through the fibers at the top.&lt;br /&gt;It felt as if it was far smaller than normal.&lt;br /&gt;And by the time I took it off, my bed was covered in &#x27;hairs&#x27; that had fallen out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I didn&#x27;t expect much from a cheap wig, it even missed my already low expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry I even bothered to buy it.</li>
    <li> So I got this wig about three weeks ago and I haven&#x27;t had time to post a review until now. I don&#x27;t have any pictures at the moment so I&#x27;ll try my best to explain it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that it&#x27;s definitely possible to get the wig to look the same way in the picture, with some styling, but of course, when it first comes in the mail, it does not look like that. The wig is a bit thin and small (for me, but I have a larger head and long thick hair). Personally, I regret buying it but I do think it could possibly work for others, as it is not terrible. If you&#x27;re looking to style it later on, I wouldnt recommend it because since its thin and slightly short, there isn&#x27;t too much to style, if you want some hairs to stick out more. If you want your hair to be predominately flat, close to the head, or straight down, then its fine.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this item.  Item is too small for my teenage daughter.</li>
    <li> i just received the wig in the mail today and it&#x27;s not good. The only good thing about it is that it feels like real hair. The downsides is that it gave me a dark brown instead of black and it&#x27;s too short to use for Izaya. It may be low price but get something else.</li>
    <li> Very nice quality and heat resistant.!</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t anything like the picture :/ it&#x27;s too short</li>
    <li> It way too small and weird shaped, do NOT look like what&#x27;s on the picture at all. Waste of money</li>
    <li> its a great wig but the only things that are wrong with it is that it doesn&#x27;t look the way it does in that picture and part of the hair on the side sticks output styling it fixes all that</li>
    <li> First thing I have to warn is that mine did not look anything like the picture! It was styled like a bob. This is not that big of a problem, I can just cut and restyle the wig, but I thought it might be good for others to know.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the wig is great! It&#x27;s the proper color, soft, and has great coverage. I would definitely recommend it if you don&#x27;t mind having to possibly style it.</li>
    <li> Too short but it was nice quality</li>
    <li> Terrible wig, terrible purchase.</li>
    <li> This wig is quite small if you have a large head and the hair quality isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
    <li> Item received is not the product pictured. The base of the wig is way too small for me (and I&#x27;m a petite individual; I wear CHILDREN&#x27;S hats), and the wig fibers are really short, and cannot be styled to look even remotely like the wig in the picture. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> I ordered this wig for an Izaya Cosplay and was extremely dissappointed. It was way too short, almost completely unstylable, and smaller then I was expecting. However, the wig is very realistic and not at all too shiny. It was simply not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Partly my fault. I like it, it has a good color, and made of high quality materials. Just too small for me because I have a huge ass head.</li>
    <li> This wig was a little small but it&#x27;s good.. It was also a little short</li>
    <li> This arrived quite quickly. For the price I think it is very good quality. My son used it for Izaya cosplay and it looked like his real hair. For masculine styles you&#x27;ll probably want to make it a little more rough - and less like a Beetles haircut -- with some gel or spray. Maybe cut it a little bit. I also straightened it easily with a curling iron. Recommend!</li>
    <li> I ended up just using this wig to pull off L from Death Note. It&#x27;s hard to get the wig to stay and look like it does in the picture, perhaps I have to use product to modify the wig. It does have a realistic look though. My dad put it on and he looked like someone from the Beetles.</li>
    <li> Wig was as shown. But you do get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This wig is super short, and it can&#x27;t be styled no matter how hard I tried. I have ordered a wig just like the one pictured awhile ago, and it was perfect. Buts it&#x27;s gotten old and I wanted to replace it, so I ordered this one. Turns out my old wig is much better than this new one. I understood at the price it was it might be a bit off in real life, but not this much. I will attach a picture to compare them, the one on the left is my old wig and the one on the right is the new one. Like seriously the wig is so short in comparison to the picture the seller used to  the item and my old wig, you can&#x27;t really tell in the pictures.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture, it looks longer and almost like a girls wig it&#x27;s long all over and looks choppy in a few spots, the bangs cover my whole face, and it&#x27;s a good 4in longer then it should be in the back and on the sides</li>
    <li> No. I bought a wig that was maybe a dollar or two more and it was way fuller</li>
    <li> THIS WIG WAS AWFAL.  TOO SHORT, NOT EVEN BLACK ITS DARK BROWN.  LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THAT PICTURE.  WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME.</li>
    <li> My brother bought me this for my Izaya and Kageyama cosplay. I love it! It looks like natural hair, and people thought I cut my hair because of it. I just needed to style it a bit since it was kind of long, but it&#x27;s a great wig for the price!</li>
    <li> if you want some good quality Buy this wig</li>
    <li> i was really nervous buying this, i was buying it for Izaya orihara and honestly, i love it. when i first opened the package i almost cried because i though it wouldn&#x27;t fit me, but it turns out it did. it doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture that would require a bit of styling. but the wig looks like me REAL hair, its not overly shinny and it is SO soft. IT DOES NOT SHED, I REPEAT IT DOES NOT SHED. i would buy this again, and im a beginner to cosplay and this looks pretty quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Very good quality for the price. My teenage daughter continues to wear it even after Halloween!</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just what I was looking for to complete my cosplay!</li>
    <li> It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It&#x27;s shiny and fake looking. The fibers are very stiff and coarse. I would not recommend buying the black wig.</li>
    <li> Disappointed!!!! First of all, it took over a month to receive. Second of all, it doesn&#x27;t matter how many times I tried it did not look like the picture. The front is way too long (almost cover to my nose) and the back is too short. I thought I had it backward but nooooo...  It&#x27;s terrible. What a waste !</li>
    <li> If you want to look like DJ Connor this is the rug for you.</li>
    <li> Good for price, but it wasnt as the the one showed on the picture, it was so short. But its so soft and has a ver y good quality.</li>
    <li> Wig came in awful shape and looks nothing like the picture.</li>
