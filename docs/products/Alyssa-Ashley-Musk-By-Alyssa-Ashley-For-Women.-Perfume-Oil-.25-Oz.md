      <li>It was really amazing  for me to come across again with this perfume that got me back on time with a lot of good memories.so</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
      <li>It is all right, but there are others that are much more&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;animal&amp;#34; like and, to this nose, much more pleasant,</li>
      <li>,so you feel that you need more to get the full affect you want.</li>
      <li>I had to do a lot of research to fine where I could buy it again.</li>

      <li>I like it because it smells so light and clean,</li>
      <li>I was so excited...</li>
      <li>This had to have been reformulated by Alyssa Ashley when it purchased Houbigant, the original manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>Most people expect a much stronger smell for musk.</li>
      <li>both women and especially men tell me how good I always smell.</li>

      <li>Not too heavy and smells great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved this since I was in high school back in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
      <li>Size is just right to carry in pocket and purse.</li>
      <li>Very, very feminine.</li>
      <li>I use to be able to buy in local drug stores.</li>

      <li>Apply this oil (and with the lotion even better) and the fragrance will last for hours.</li>
      <li>This is not the original Musk Oil scent that I grew to love a few years ago.</li>
      <li>the only comment I can make that the smell is not as strong as it use to be,hope it gets improved.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Purchased for my mom with lotion as this was her scent when I was a little girl.  She loved it!</li>
    <li> So love this Musk Oil!!</li>
    <li> i have a hard time with perfume because of my body chemicals and this is the only one I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t turn to an awfully strong scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for years. It is my favorite. It smells so good. I love it. What more can I say.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice fresh scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Alyssa Ashley musk since my early twenties and at 50 am still enjoying it for my everyday scent. It is soft, and comforting to me and people who know me.    For a while it was getting difficult to find, thank you Amazon for carrying it. I use the bubbling bath gel, too for subtle layers.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with how quickly I received this &amp; I was so excited...used to wear this Musk Oil years ago &amp; always received compliments...well, I am very disappointed.  It seems to be watered down big time!  The smell is very faint and weak.  I put it all over and later asked someone if they could smell it and they said \\&quot;no\\&quot;....to top it off the applicator stick broke off of the lid, so that was another problem.  I so looked forward to finally finding my favorite perfume oil...have allergies &amp; can&#x27;t wear spray &amp; this never bothered me at all....my bubble sure was busted.  Wasn&#x27;t worth paying S&amp;H to send it back.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for many years.  A rich but subtle fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this scent!! I used to wear it years back, and just went back to it. It is something I have been complimented on many times.</li>
    <li> I got Alyssa Ashley Musk for Christmas 30 years ago from my husband and children. It was the best gift and I still use it today. It has gotten difficult to find, I can only get it through Amazon now. Thank you Amazon for carrying this fragrance! Quite often when someone gives me a hug, they will comment on how good I smell. They are usually surprised when I say it is Alyssa Ashley Musk. Most people expect a much stronger smell for musk. This one is light but lingering. My grown children tell me I can never change my fragrance because they associate this smell with me. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I always wore Coty wild musk, but it is no longer available, I replaced it with Alyssa Ashley musk and feel I get the same (well similar) frangrance I always loved, very subtle</li>
    <li> Having read good things about Alyssa Ashley, thought to take a chance&lt;br /&gt;on this Musk Oil.  It is all right, but there are others that are much more&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;animal&amp;#34; like and, to this nose, much more pleasant,</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my Grandmother. Nothing bad to say.</li>
    <li> I recieved the product that I paid for as agreed.  I am a satisfied customer.  Years ago I liked this perfume oil so I thought I would try it again.  It seems to have less musk and more oil now.</li>
    <li> I have worn Alyssa Ashley Musk Perfume Oil for many years.  It is almost imposible to find.  I love it!  The fragrance stays on for hours without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> love, love, love.. thank you..</li>
    <li> Because of the photo it gives the idea that one will get all four items...they should show only the one you will get. In a way I think that is false advertising and was not pleased at all even tho they put the ml.  The person off the street does not really know how much that is going to be. I was disappointed because of that. Why else would they picture all four unless you were getting them?  Not happy.</li>
    <li> perfumes, long lasting and I always get compliments when I wear it. So glad I could purchase on line as in stores it is quite .expensive.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine was visiting me one day and I noticed this beautiful smell and asked her what was she wearing.  She said musk oil but couldn&#x27;t remember the name. I told her as soon as you get home, please call and give me the name and she did. The next day I immediately went and bought this oil and that was some thirty plus years ago and I&#x27;m still wearing it. (I do agree with the lady that has been wearing this oil just as long, that it doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as when we first started wearing the oil and it does smell a little weak,so you feel that you need more to get the full affect you want. And yes I say affect,because it really arouses the senses(if you know what I mean). I make sure that I never give out. I like it because it smells so light and clean, like you&#x27;ve just got out of a bath or shower.  I&#x27;ve had both women and especially men tell me how good I always smell. I&#x27;m told at work they know when I&#x27;ve been in the area because, know one else smells that good but you!!!!!!!!!!  I&#x27;ve tried other musk oils but they&#x27;re not the same. BTW! I highly recommend the Oil and not the spray!!!</li>
    <li> I buy it for my mom she just loves it when she gets that little box filled with the only perfume she can wear</li>
    <li> Trying to find a nice clean scent.</li>
    <li> Love this!! Not too heavy and smells great. Oldie but a goodie.</li>
    <li> Alyssa Ashley is a light perfumed lotion that is  smooth like silk on your skin. I love it. The fragrance is a light musk smell that lingers, not overpowers. It is like aroma therapy for me. It elevates my mood and I feel confident all day.</li>
    <li> The smell does not stay for very long  You just put it on and the scent disappears  would not recomend</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell that lasts all day &amp; I love when people say all day &amp;#34; huh, you smell good&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I was just ok not the what it use to smell like...</li>
    <li> The oil came in to my expectations. Was so glad to see that...</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this was not what I was looking for.  Although this is nice it is not like the ones from Jovan in the 70&#x27;s.  The one&lt;br /&gt;from the 70&#x27;s lasted far longer, this one I can barely smell it after 20 minutes.  All in all it is not bad just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I used to wear Alyssa Ashley Musk all the time in the 70&#x27;s. I think that what they have now seems to be a milder version. I think it is not as concentrated. I still like it though. Men &amp; women can use it. It&#x27;s a musk. A boyfriend I had used to wear it &amp; was actually the first time I ever smelled it on someone. He smelled sooo good.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this perfume for nearly 30 years (!) and it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> I finally can get my perfume</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  Wish it was cheaper.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this musk oil for 40 years now. My mom got me wearing it, cause she did. I use to be able to buy in local drug stores. The only place I can get it now is on line. I always purchase this musk oil through Amazon. I get asked all the time what I am wearing, even though I cannot smell it, everyone around me can.</li>
    <li> Love it - lost track the past few years and now back to using it.</li>
    <li> It is my favor perfume</li>
    <li> Mmmmmmmm Love this on my Darling...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what happend to the original musk of a few of decades ago...now it seems like vegetable oil with a drop of scent that lasts no more than 3 seconds once you open the cap...actually its like the scent is only in the cap...truly sad how they can sell cheap oil &amp; call it perfume &amp; charge what they do...really don&#x27;t waste your hard earned money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved this since I was in high school back in the 80&#x27;s.  Still a great perfume and the oil lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I finally found this fragrance again! I was afraid they didn&#x27;t make this anymore. I wore this many years ago. Love it as much today as I did then.</li>
    <li> Great quality as always! It was a great gift for the holidays! Quick shipment and good price for the product.</li>
    <li> .I love this product. This is the only perfume oil I&#x27;ll wear.I was very disappointed that where I could buy it stop selling it. I had to do a lot of research to fine where I could buy it again. Only perfume oil that smells good on me and will stay on all day long. The spray doesn&#x27;t stay on all day like the oil.</li>
    <li> The oil by Alyssa Ashley is even better Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Bamboo</li>
    <li> Just as my mother remembered it!</li>
    <li> This oil works w/your own body chemistry. I just love it, dont need alot just a small dab.&lt;br /&gt;Hubby loves it too :)</li>
    <li> Wow, what a disappointment from the past.  This used to smell good.  It doesn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
    <li> Looked everywhere for the product...found it, bought it. and absolutely love it!  Will absolutely recommend it to whoever is looking for it.</li>
    <li> In my opinion Alyssa Ashley is the purest musk oil you can find. And it&#x27;s not easy to find in stores so I was delighted when I saw that Amazon carries it. Apply this oil (and with the lotion even better) and the fragrance will last for hours. Not heavy, not real light, just heavenly. And yes, I absolutely recommend it as well as seller.</li>
    <li> It was really amazing  for me to come across again with this perfume that got me back on time with a lot of good memories.so I had to buy it and give to my wife as a huge surprise as a gift as it was the perfume she used when I met her.&lt;br /&gt;thanks again Amazon for having this product on your web site available for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a new family member.  She loves this scent and was very happy to receive it!</li>
    <li> the only comment I can make that the smell is not as strong as it use to be,hope it gets improved.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. Cannot find the oil in local retailers.</li>
    <li> would recomend my wife loves it ,if she happy it&#x27;s ok with me,it arrived in a reasonable amount of time</li>
    <li> A friend bought me this in high school and I loved it. My mom wears this daily in the spray. They have changed the formula. It&#x27;s not as strong. Still smells good. The oil seems to last longer.</li>
    <li> This is not the original Musk Oil scent that I grew to love a few years ago. This had to have been reformulated by Alyssa Ashley when it purchased Houbigant, the original manufacturer.  Like they say if it isn&#x27;t broken, don&#x27;t fix it. Alyssa Ashley ruined what used to be a very pleasant fragrance. I won&#x27;t use what I just bought. It is sickening, syrupy sweet. To be perfectly honest, it stinks.</li>
    <li> been using it for years &#x3D; many compliments on the scent</li>
    <li> The best and so easy to keep on hand! Love everything about it! never go to anything else for me!</li>
    <li> Because I have been wearing this product for over 30 years and I Love it. I will order more when this is done.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Get a lot of compliments on it. Size is just right to carry in pocket and purse.</li>
    <li> I love the Musk scent and the oil lasts and lasts. I have used the product for years but cant find it in the stores</li>
    <li> A blast from the past - I used to wear this when I was in high school, way back in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s. People always noticed it and asked what I was wearing. I was amazed to see it here on Amazon, and at a great price. So I treated myself to a bottle, and when I uncapped it it took me immediately back to my teenage years - it stills smells the same: musky, with a hint of baby powder. Very, very feminine. I liked it so much I proceeded to buy the matching body wash, also at a great price.</li>
    <li> I work at a residential home for the elderly and one of my residents had an empty bottle on her dresser, I asked her about it and she told me her husband had given that to her , who has now past away, however she didn&#x27;t know where to get it any more. I told her I would look on Amazon to see what I could find. That is why and who I bought it for. She was very happy with it. Thank you for that.</li>
    <li> My local pharmacy stopped selling this musk last year so I was happy to see it online for almost the same price. I purchased from a vendor who uses SuperSaver shipping and ended up paying the same as If purchased locally. Like many other reviewers, I&#x27;ve been using Alyssa Ashley for a gazillion years, since even before it was Alyssa Ashley!</li>
