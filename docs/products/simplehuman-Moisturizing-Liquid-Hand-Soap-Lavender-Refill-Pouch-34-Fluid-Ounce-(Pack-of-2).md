      <li>It also has a nice purple hue</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Adding your own soap you would have to be concern about the viscosity of your mixture.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

      <li>We use it with the automatic dispenser that I got as a gift and love it.</li>
      <li>This soap is a nice lightly-scented soap that isn&#x27;t overly strong, and leaves hands feeling clean (and not film-y).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We bought the hands free dispenser and a soap sample came with it, and we fell in love.</li>
      <li>It is strong</li>

      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Simplehuman products.</li>
      <li>This soap is wonderful; unlike any other hand soaps, this one is truly moisturizing and it does not dry the hands!</li>
      <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
      <li>very quiet, no drip, nice soap.  </li>
      <li>This product smells great, you can use very little</li>
      <li>You do get a lot of soap (34 x 2 fluid ounces will last a while), and the consistency is great for pump dispensers, even if they&#x27;re not made by simplehuman.</li>
      <li>and it actually removes cooking scents from your hands like garlic, and even that kind of \\&quot;old sponge\\&quot; smell on your hands after doing dishes!!</li>
      <li>This Lavender soap has a very nice smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
      <li>No messy spills or clean- ups.  </li>
      <li>The best part though is that the soap actually does moisture my hands which means that I am using actual moisturizer a lot less.  </li>
      <li>I really like this scent.</li>
      <li>This soap is so gentle, but cleans well.</li>
      <li>Check out their site for all kinds of neat household products at reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>Works very well in simplehuman dispensers.  </li>
      <li>It really does leave your hands softer.</li>
      <li>This really turned out to be a better deal than buying other liquid soaps at warehouses or wherever.</li>
      <li>I have had other soap that would dispense a lot more and not be as soapy as the simplehuman soap.</li>
      <li>I bought the soap mainly on suggestion of the manufacture</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s $19.50 from simplehuman direct.</li>
      <li>the scent is soft.</li>
      <li>However, I do find that it leaves my hands pretty dry after using it--though your experience may differ.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, especially if you have an automatic soap dispenser.</li>
      <li>My hands tend to dry out quite uncomfortably after washing them with most soaps, but this soap doesn&#x27;t do it nearly as much.</li>

    <li> Great product, however, grossly overpriced. If you pay anything over $15 for the two-pack you are getting ripped off. So mad when I went to Bed Bad and Beyond and saw that this was $6.99. It&#x27;s $19.50 from simplehuman direct. Really angry with myself for not doing the research.</li>
    <li> works really well but is too expensive. I wish they would decrease their price a bit; hard to justify this much.</li>
    <li> This is very good liquid hand soap with a nice fragrance and easy-pour and store packaging.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> You do get a lot of soap (34 x 2 fluid ounces will last a while), and the consistency is great for pump dispensers, even if they&#x27;re not made by simplehuman. The smell is nice and strong and the soap lathers nicely. However, I do find that it leaves my hands pretty dry after using it--though your experience may differ. I&#x27;ll probably try another brand the next time I need to refill my soap dispensers, but I don&#x27;t regret this purchase, and will get plenty of enjoyment out of this nice-smelling soap while it lasts.</li>
    <li> Love the soap.  Nice on hands.</li>
    <li> This Lavender soap has a very nice smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. You can smell it while your washing your hands and a minute later (if that long), the smell is gone. I wouldn&#x27;t call it extremely soapy but it gets the job done. I have had other soap that would dispense a lot more and not be as soapy as the simplehuman soap. I really can not say anything bad about this product other than I wish it was a little more soapy, but again, it does get the job done. Its the only reason I am giving 4 stars, I would only take a half star off if the system would let me.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It really does leave your hands softer. I highly recommend it, especially if you have an automatic soap dispenser.</li>
    <li> This product smells wonderful and works perfectly in the simplehuman dispensers. I order about every 3 months, just waiting to determine the actual usage before we put on automatic refill status.</li>
    <li> Works very well in simplehuman dispensers.  Easy but not watery flow, lathers well, and smells good, too.  Easy fill spout, as compared to the snip-off-the-corner filling for the free soap that comes with the dispenser.</li>
    <li> This is nice soap with a clean and refreshing smell and it works perfectly with the simple human dispensor.  I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> You get a really nice size bag of this refill soap. One bag has lasted my family 6 months. Great buy!</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used it for a while.  Sorry to learn the lavender scent will no longer be available via Amazon.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this refill at these inflated price; Simple not human. (12/8/14)&lt;br /&gt;34 oz can be had at your local big box store for $6.99 unless you are getting the six pack from simplehuman.&lt;br /&gt;About the product.  I am using it because I am assuming they design the product to be use with their machine and should not clog it.&lt;br /&gt;Adding your own soap you would have to be concern about the viscosity of your mixture.&lt;br /&gt;The soap works quite well and the Lavender scent is pleasing but I don&#x27;t know about the chemical properties.</li>
    <li> I really like this scent. It&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
    <li> This soap is a nice lightly-scented soap that isn&#x27;t overly strong, and leaves hands feeling clean (and not film-y).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is nice too, as it collapses as you&#x27;re dispensing it into a soap pump. When you&#x27;re emptying it, it ultimately becomes a flat pouch! Less plastic/less waste doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> performs as advertised.  very quiet, no drip, nice soap.  I just wish the price was a bit lower, but a great product.</li>
    <li> My hands tend to dry out quite uncomfortably after washing them with most soaps, but this soap doesn&#x27;t do it nearly as much. It smells great -- not too strong or flowery, but just pleasant and clean. It also has a nice purple hue and I use it in the simplehuman bathroom pumps.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful; unlike any other hand soaps, this one is truly moisturizing and it does not dry the hands! It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> We have 3 of the Simplehuman electric dispensers now. I bought the soap mainly on suggestion of the manufacture but I do like the soap. I don&#x27;t think this is an anti-bacterial soap, they have another with a yellow square on it that is. The smell I think is similar to pine but not sure. It is strong but I have grown to like it just fine.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to this soap from a more expensive brand that I have been ordering from Amazon for years.  I am quite pleased with my decision.  The scent is light and pleasant without being overwhelming.  The best part though is that the soap actually does moisture my hands which means that I am using actual moisturizer a lot less.  I also ended up buying the Simple Human soap dispenser as well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about Simplehuman products. We bought the hands free dispenser and a soap sample came with it, and we fell in love. We won&#x27;t use anything else. This soap is so gentle, but cleans well. the scent is soft. It is made for the dispenser. I highly recommend these products. Check out their site for all kinds of neat household products at reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> This really turned out to be a better deal than buying other liquid soaps at warehouses or wherever. This product smells great, you can use very little and it actually removes cooking scents from your hands like garlic, and even that kind of \\&quot;old sponge\\&quot; smell on your hands after doing dishes!! We use it with the automatic dispenser that I got as a gift and love it.</li>
    <li> Love the great smell!  This is easy pour too!!  No messy spills or clean- ups.  Truly a great and useful device.</li>
    <li> smells great, works great with the automatic pumps.  The other liquid soaps I have tried are too thick and they make the pump work very slowly.</li>
