      <li>These are the BEST.  </li>

      <li>These have worked great for me.  </li>
      <li>A spa experience in your own shower with these two products is wonderful.</li>
      <li>one pair in the laundry, one pair in the shower\\&quot; and those two pairs in rotation are still in great shape.</li>

      <li>I love these gloves!  </li>
      <li>Try them - I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree! -</li>
      <li>What an amazing feeling on your body.  </li>
      <li>They suds up nicely.</li>
      <li>These exfoliating gloves are thicker than ones I&#x27;ve tried from The Body Shop or Bath &amp; Body works, and they work up a nice lather.</li>
      <li>liked this color and that they came in a 4 pack.  </li>
      <li>and I have not torn off any of the glove by catching the threading.</li>
      <li>For one, they feel thicker, sturdier which is nice.  </li>
      <li>It comes in a pack of 4 which is good to have backups and not have bacteria after so many uses.     </li>
      <li>There are places though that a lady should NEVER use this item, kind of goes without saying, hehe..  </li>
      <li>I had bought these thinner exfoliating gloves at target and really liked them.  </li>
      <li>I think the texture is perfect and my skin has never ever felt this soft.  </li>
      <li>The gloves are well made, great material and a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>First, use one of these gloves instead a of a wash cloth:  great skin care.  </li>
      <li>They are a bit thicker, a bit roomier, and they hold up better to being washed.  </li>
      <li>My husband has been noticing too :)</li>
      <li>I like the mini-quilted feel (more felt on my hands then</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order more if these ever need replacement.  </li>
      <li>Using these three products together has resulted in healthy skin.  </li>
      <li>I like that they fit like a glove and help create a nice lather.</li>
      <li>After exfoliation, which takes no time at all, I have found my skin to absorb lotion and/or body oil much better.</li>
      <li>They also rinse very easily, making it easy to get all the soap off.  </li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>I think my skin may be softer at this point than my two year old&#x27;s, lol.  </li>
      <li>They are very durable and they make a good lather of your soap, scrub or body wash.</li>
      <li>Very nice soft to the touch gloves.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to get a good lather going, and with a nice, emollient soap (my current fav is the goat&#x27;s milk soap from \\&quot;Sassy</li>
      <li>(as often as I can on my feet, though, and it&#x27;s easy, too b/c</li>
      <li>Rinse easily in the shower.</li>
      <li>These are easy to use.</li>
      <li>I read customer reviews on earth therapeutics exfoliating gloves, took a chance on their positive reviews, and am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>They worked fine</li>
      <li>Give a good scrubbing and require less soap for a good lather.</li>
      <li>After one use my skin felt wonderfully smooth and silky.  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy showers.     </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use these</li>
      <li>the plus of they are made eco friendly.</li>
      <li>The organic nature and all natural qualities offered by Tree Huts sugar scrub with its wonderful scent and low price is just an added bonus.</li>
      <li>Gives a clean feeling after shower, I never shower again without them.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
      <li>These gloves are thick, contain exfoliating properties throughout, and work wonderfully.</li>
      <li>every other is great, though....</li>
      <li>Lather up the top of the gloves, too; great for scrubbing your middle and lower back.</li>
      <li>Used in conjunction with my homemade goat&#x27;s milk coffee soap: it&#x27;s created my own personal spa treatment.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve read that the gloves are just more hygienic than the loofah because they dry easily.</li>
      <li>Other than that, good product.</li>
      <li>Not too harsh-just the right amount of &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; to them.</li>
      <li>These are shower gloves right?</li>
      <li>Like another reviewer said when you apply lotion or oil afterwards your skin will soak it right up and will glow beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like these gloves - they are a bit large for my hands (but I have small hands), but are great for working body wash into a rich lather and keep their texture.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used these gloves everyday for 2 months now and I am more than pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>My skin looks great and they remove any dull looking skin.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still using the first pair of gloves I started with, and they show no signs of wear.</li>
      <li>This is my first experience using exfoliating gloves.</li>
      <li>Goat\\&quot;), my skin get smooth and soft in no time, with no need to use a moisturizer.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve been using the first pair for a couple months.  </li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward.</li>
      <li>They make a whole lot more sense than the gel body scrubs that barely have any grit in them and seem to do nothing compared to these gloves.</li>
      <li>Be gentle when using on your face!</li>
      <li>and I am still on my first &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; (only use one hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy more if they ever runs out.</li>
      <li>Unlike other gloves I have used, these last way longer, they exfoliate much better, and they are easy to rinse and clean.</li>
      <li>and they leave my skin super soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I have noticed they clean better than my usual grocery store gloves 2-3 passes &amp; your go to go.</li>
      <li>Buy these, enjoy skin you never thought you had and never look back.</li>
      <li>They are so much nicer than the ones I&#x27;d gotten at target.  </li>
      <li>I wanted an extra pair but didn&#x27;t like the colors available</li>
      <li>Very well made.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s your whole hand</li>
      <li>I really like these gloves</li>
      <li>I enjoy my skin being hydrated and use lotion on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>PROS: gentle on skin, exfoliates well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Much thicker than the ones that can be bought at the drug store.</li>
      <li>You can scrub if you need to but gentle washing is sufficient.  </li>
      <li>I even use them - gently - on my face.</li>
      <li>They not only make my skin silky smooth, but are long-lasting as well.  </li>
      <li>Although the gloves can apparently be used with regular soap/shower gel, I purchased Tree Hut Sugar Scrub with Shea Butter Coconut Lime, which I love.</li>
      <li>the gloves are better made than the average glove one might pick up at a Target or Bath &amp; Body.</li>
      <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll use very light strokes on my face ( with the same soap)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not a problem since I latter up first w/loofah puff sponge first then exfoliate/clean body.</li>
      <li>but my skin has gotten extra smooth and soft in places I didn&#x27;t even think about.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend and buy again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I purchased these gloves because I usually use a loofah and felt that the gloves would be a good way to \\&quot;scrub\\&quot; down.     It comes in a pack of 4 which is good to have backups and not have bacteria after so many uses.     The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because when you have your hands/gloves with soap; it is a little snug and hard to take off.     Other than that, good product.</li>
    <li> I got these when preparing to use fakebake for a base tan before going to Mexico on vacation. My wife and I both used them, and they worked great. I actually liked them enough to keep using them once a week even after completing the fake tan process. I feel a bit like a metro-sexual, but I like the way my skin feels afterward! Recommended for their intended purpose: exfoliating skin to remove dead skin cells and allow new ones to take their place. Be gentle when using on your face! (I accidentally got a bit rough with an eyelid, this being my first time. Ouch).</li>
    <li> Bought these on Amazon. I can no longer find this sort of scrubbing glove in the markets here. These are especially nice cause they&#x27;re very thick compared to the previous gloves I bought at the market. They come in a pack of 4 so you have plenty of spares and can rotate and launder frequently. Very well made. Give a good scrubbing and require less soap for a good lather.</li>
    <li> These gloves make my skin feel amazing! The quality can not be beat! They are very durable and they make a good lather of your soap, scrub or body wash. A must for every shower!</li>
    <li> I like these gloves - they are a bit large for my hands (but I have small hands), but are great for working body wash into a rich lather and keep their texture.  I like the mini-quilted feel (more felt on my hands then my body, but hey, it&#x27;s still like I&#x27;m being pampered).  Also, they are cheaper on Amazon than you can find them in Ricky&#x27;s NYC or in some drugstores.</li>
    <li> First, use one of these gloves instead a of a wash cloth:  great skin care.  They exfoliate.  You can scrub if you need to but gentle washing is sufficient.  They also rinse very easily, making it easy to get all the soap off.  (If not rinsed completely, soap can CAUSE pimples).      Second, I use these together with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser.  Result is that skin is neither dry nor oily.      Third,  get an exfoliating cloth that lets you scrub your back and any place that you can&#x27;t reach with a glove.  It&#x27;s a piece of material about three feet long, made of material similar to these gloves.  You can find them on amazon.  Search Exfoliating Bath Cloth or Beauty Skin Cloth.    Using these three products together has resulted in healthy skin.  Quick and easy showers.     I bought gloves in a local store.  They worked fine but  when I needed another pair I could not find them again.  Amazon solved that problem.    You only need one glove at a time, so buying a pair gives you a spare.  They should make them in white: wearing one white glove you can do Michael Jackson routines in the shower!    These have worked great for me.  I&#x27;ll order more if these ever need replacement.  I wish I had these when I was a teenager.</li>
    <li> Not too scratchy, but rough enough to do the job.  Gloves seem to hold together well and -- while tight and probably not great for large hands -- they work great with my smaller hands.</li>
    <li> No more messy, smelly, expensive exfoliating lotions for me! These turn my hands into exfoliating machines. They have just the right amount of roughness; enough to get the job done without a lot of scrubbing, but not so much that my skin ends up feeling raw. I even use them - gently - on my face. It&#x27;s easy to get a good lather going, and with a nice, emollient soap (my current fav is the goat&#x27;s milk soap from \\&quot;Sassy Goat\\&quot;), my skin get smooth and soft in no time, with no need to use a moisturizer. Lather up the top of the gloves, too; great for scrubbing your middle and lower back. I&#x27;m still using the first pair of gloves I started with, and they show no signs of wear.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  the gloves are better made than the average glove one might pick up at a Target or Bath &amp; Body. They are a bit thicker, a bit roomier, and they hold up better to being washed.  I&#x27;ve had the product for over a year, and i&#x27;ve still only opened two of the four packages (one pair in the laundry, one pair in the shower\\&quot; and those two pairs in rotation are still in great shape.</li>
    <li> These exfoliating gloves are thicker than ones I&#x27;ve tried from The Body Shop or Bath &amp; Body works, and they work up a nice lather. BUT the only thing missing is the loop so you can hang them up in the shower to dry after each use.</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price. Very happy when receiving them. Thick enough and last almost forever. Gives a clean feeling after shower, I never shower again without them.&lt;br /&gt;With the plus of they are made eco friendly. they also dry fast from avoiding getting mold in the humid environment. At least 2 years after I received this gloves and I am still on my first &amp;#34;hand&amp;#34; (only use one hand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy more if they ever runs out.</li>
    <li> The Earth Therapeutics Hydro Exfoliating gloves are made well.  These gloves do not stretch out in a few uses like other brands.</li>
    <li> I bought a 4 pack of these gloves after succumbing to itchy, flaky winter skin. When they arrived, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but I was pleasantly surprised! The gloves are fairly rough and they take a little while to get used to, but my skin hasn&#x27;t been this soft in recent memory. Even my elbows are smooth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order these. They have solved my problem of winter skin. They do seem a little weird to others when you leave them in the shower, but they do the job of exfoliating better than any scrub I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these gloves everyday for 2 months now and I am more than pleased with the results.  I shower twice daily and while that may seem like a lot of scrubbing, these gloves, being directly on my hands as opposed to something I&#x27;m holding, allow me to control how much pressure I&#x27;m putting on my body at any given time.  I think the texture is perfect and my skin has never ever felt this soft.  I think my skin may be softer at this point than my two year old&#x27;s, lol.  Like another reviewer said when you apply lotion or oil afterwards your skin will soak it right up and will glow beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that I don&#x27;t even need lotion after my nighttime shower and if I scratch my nails up against my skin there are no scratch marks, because there&#x27;s no dead skin anywhere!  Also these are great for hard to reach places, i.e. behind the ears, belly button, between toes etc. There are places though that a lady should NEVER use this item, kind of goes without saying, hehe..  That would be brutal.  Lastly for all my hyperpigmented ladies, I have dark underarms due to oil/deoderant build up and have used my washcloth/loofah to scrub under there for years in order to clear it up.  After a week of doing some concentrated scrubbing right after shaving it has cleared up by at least 60%.  Which is a bonus as this was never my reason for getting the gloves to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to think the loofah was the end all/be all to exfoliating but now a loofah seems like a joke.  Buy these, enjoy skin you never thought you had and never look back.</li>
    <li> Much thicker than the ones that can be bought at the drug store. The 4 pack is great because you can have one in each shower and your gym bag!</li>
    <li> This is my first experience using exfoliating gloves. I have contemplated using them in the past, however, the ones I came across in stores felt thin and not abrasive enough to exfoliate. I read customer reviews on earth therapeutics exfoliating gloves, took a chance on their positive reviews, and am so glad I did! These gloves are thick, contain exfoliating properties throughout, and work wonderfully. Although the gloves can apparently be used with regular soap/shower gel, I purchased Tree Hut Sugar Scrub with Shea Butter Coconut Lime, which I love. After one use my skin felt wonderfully smooth and silky.  I enjoy my skin being hydrated and use lotion on a regular basis. Why put lotion on dead skin cells? After exfoliation, which takes no time at all, I have found my skin to absorb lotion and/or body oil much better. The organic nature and all natural qualities offered by Tree Huts sugar scrub with its wonderful scent and low price is just an added bonus. A spa experience in your own shower with these two products is wonderful. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, males and females, enjoy![[ASIN:B0018DE6AI Tree Hut Shea Sugar Body Scrub, Coconut Lime, 18-Ounce Jars (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> Gave for gifts. Heavy duty compared the the ones in the store for a buck. Wonderful! I would highly recommend and buy again.</li>
    <li> Very nice soft to the touch gloves. Not like the cheapo Target brand. This feels nicer than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> The gloves are well made, great material and a very reasonable price. There&#x27;s just one caveat and a major oversight in my opinion.. There&#x27;s no loops to hang the gloves. These are shower gloves right? The material is too stiff to hang on a hook just on the opening, so they fall off a hook, every time. Therefore, you have to throw them on a shelf, which is just asking to build up mold.</li>
    <li> I was actually considering spending a couple hundred dollars for a Clarisonic b/c it has enough power to use a bigger brush to scrub your body.  Well, guess what. I have enough power to scrub my body using these gloves . . . without the extra cost.  There were four pairs in the pack I got, so I shared some. They suds up nicely. I get the back of the gloves soapy and can reach around to scrub my back using the back of my hand.  They feel a little scratcy when you first use them, but it&#x27;s not enough to feel uncomfortable to make you quit using them. They make a whole lot more sense than the gel body scrubs that barely have any grit in them and seem to do nothing compared to these gloves.</li>
    <li> PROS: gentle on skin, exfoliates well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: can build up mildew and mold if not air dried properly (as with all bath products). Not for small hands as gloves will not sit right on your hands while using.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these gloves for 2 years now - I had previous tried several other gloves.  These are the BEST.  Not too rough and not too soft.  My daughter gets these tiny bumps all over the back of her arms - and the solution is to exfoliate - these gloves got rid of them. As long as they sell these - we both will continue to buy and use.  What an amazing feeling on your body.  Try them - I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll agree! - To hang them up - I just took some thread - and made a loop and sewed that in so I could hang them up to dry.</li>
    <li> I use a soap that has benzoyl peroxide in it and that causes a lot of dry skin sometimes... plus the heat is still on for winter.  These seemed very rough at first but my skin has gotten extra smooth and soft in places I didn&#x27;t even think about.  Like my feet.  And my hands.  And the underside of my butt and my hips.... awesome.  They&#x27;re a little much to use every time, though.... every other is great, though.... (as often as I can on my feet, though, and it&#x27;s easy, too b/c it&#x27;s your whole hand and you can &amp;#34;detail&amp;#34; areas)</li>
    <li> I typically have dry skin during winter, but I didn&#x27;t this year!  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use these and they leave my skin super soft and moisturized.  I also use gently on my face and has helped my face appear brighter and less breakouts.</li>
    <li> Unlike other gloves I have used, these last way longer, they exfoliate much better, and they are easy to rinse and clean.</li>
    <li> I really like these gloves but they have 2 cons. No loops to hang gloves &amp; thicker quilt like material which I found soaks up body wash so it may not latter up as before. Not a problem since I latter up first w/loofah puff sponge first then exfoliate/clean body. They look like they should last 6 months w/weekly washing just like grocery store gloves. I have noticed they clean better than my usual grocery store gloves 2-3 passes &amp; your go to go.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using the first pair for a couple months.  the best bathing i&#x27;ve ever had.  i highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use. They exfoliate gently for everyday use. I like that they fit like a glove and help create a nice lather. I&#x27;ve  officially switched  from my pouf to these.  My only compliant and why I didn&#x27;t give these 5 stars is because there isn&#x27;t a string attached to hang them. Until I either attach one myself or figure something else out I put them over my sink handle to dry.</li>
    <li> These gloves are wonderful.  They not only make my skin silky smooth, but are long-lasting as well.  Very satisfied with the purchase.  Yes, I would buy them again!</li>
    <li> I had bought these thinner exfoliating gloves at target and really liked them.  I wanted an extra pair but didn&#x27;t like the colors available so I ended up getting a loofah.  Compared to my exfoliating gloves, the loofah just didn&#x27;t work as well and I&#x27;ve read that the gloves are just more hygienic than the loofah because they dry easily. So, I came on Amazon and searched for the gloves in a different color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this color and that they came in a 4 pack.  They are so much nicer than the ones I&#x27;d gotten at target.  For one, they feel thicker, sturdier which is nice.  They also feel somehow less scratchy but still leave my skin smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them in my shower but they work best when I&#x27;ve soaked in my tub about 20 minutes.  After I&#x27;ve done that, I start scrubbing my body down and its amazing how much dead skin comes off.  Maybe its because I sometimes only do it once a week, but I will rub my arm with the glove and look at it and I can see a white haze of skin on it. Its kind of gross but at least I know its working. My skin feels so soft and smooth afterward.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves!  My skin looks great and they remove any dull looking skin.  I wouldn&#x27;t trade them for anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these great gloves now for about a month. Used in conjunction with my homemade goat&#x27;s milk coffee soap: it&#x27;s created my own personal spa treatment.  In the shower,I begin at my feet massaging firmly up my legs, then circular on the stomach and back, then downward strokes on the arms , and last gently on my chest . Occasionally I&#x27;ll use very light strokes on my face ( with the same soap)&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a visible difference in the appearance of my skin. Combined with healthy eating , daily exercise, and this luxurious treatment, I feel ten years younger. My husband has been noticing too :)</li>
    <li> Perfect for exfoliating. Not too harsh-just the right amount of &amp;#34;roughness&amp;#34; to them. Rinse easily in the shower. You need to hang them up to dry - I use the small hook on the side of our shower caddy. Don&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;wear out&amp;#34;. So far so good!</li>
    <li> you know those ugly brown bumps?  I have them.  I can definitely see an improvement after reading recommendations to buy exfoliating gloves. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. they are well made.  I never take off my wedding ring or engagement ring and I slip these on in the shower and I have not torn off any of the glove by catching the threading.</li>
