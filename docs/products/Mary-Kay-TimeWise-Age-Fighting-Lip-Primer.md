<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I don&#x27;t see any positive effects by using this product.</li>
    <li> Did a good job of covering lip lines for smooth lipstick application. Lipstick did not run. Would buy here again.</li>
    <li> THIS IS AN AWESOME PRODUCT. LIKE MANY, I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL PRODUCTS HOPING TO FIND THE ONE. THIS ONE HAS HELPED SOFTEN THE LINES AROUND MY LIPS AND IT HELPS WITH LIPSTICK BLEEDING AND IT SEEMS TO HELP KEEP THE COLOR LONGER.</li>
    <li> A lot of the other reviews say that this product is very moisturizing. That is true. It makes my lips very soft. However, I didn&#x27;t find it to help at all as a primer. It did not seem to make a difference whether I wore it with my lipstick or not. And that is what I bought it for. So, I have to give it a low rating. :-(</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I&#x27;ve never been a huge fan of Mary Kay and this just reminded my why. I felt like i was putting glue on my lips.</li>
    <li> My lipstick does not feather when I use this product. I  This is a good product that is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> This is a good lip primer it does help lipstick stay and makes the lips look smoother.  I do find it a little drying and that is a disappointment.  My lips are dry as it is.</li>

    <li> smooths out any imperfections on your lips and keeps lipstick from &amp;#34;running&amp;#34; into any lines above the lips.  Helps lipstick last longer after application.</li>
    <li> This product did a great job.  It should come in a more durable container with more product.  It went too fast.....all used up.</li>
    <li> Everything happens for a reason. Urban Decay stopped making their lipstick primer and I decided to go on amazon and shop around. I loved Mary Kay products before, even though it&#x27;s been a while since I used anything for them. But I&#x27;m back and at a much lower price than Urban Decay! I love how smooth it is and my lipstick last longer and better than UD. It all happens for a reason and sometimes a good reason!</li>
    <li> This really works. My lipstick no longer leaks into the lines around my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I told my dermatologist about it and he was VERY happy to know about this&lt;br /&gt;product since he has many patients who are seniors like me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only product of its kind that really works!  Easy to use and very light to carry in my purse AND the top stays on!</li>
    <li> I thought it could do better,but no miracles there.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use, lasts long, absolutely keeps all lipsticks and glosses from feathering!&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is so portable! and comfortable to wear.  It also makes your lipstick and gloss last longer!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good lip primer since Rimmel stopped making one that I love.  Mary Kay&#x27;s lip primer is good, not great, but the best replacement I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
    <li> Love this primer.  My lipstick never bleeds.</li>
    <li> I previously used Revlon lip primer but they don&#x27;t make it anymore.  I tried this one, instead of moist &amp; light, it is gluey</li>
    <li> Keep your lips red longer by applying this amazing Mary Kay primer. I can eat and drink and it still stays! - happy customer ;)</li>
    <li> I Love it!! I have ordered it several times and will continue to order it. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> sometimes sticky and my lips cracking with this.</li>
    <li> I like it and will probably order again. It goes on smooth and creamy. I put in on before lip liner then line my lips and color them in with the liner. Finally it is time for lipstick. That makes it stay all day.</li>
    <li> I love this . I put chopstick underneath. MAKES lipstick last for hours and the white make your lip color stand out.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. But way to expensive. So won&#x27;t be ordering any more. The shipping is more than this product is selling for.</li>
