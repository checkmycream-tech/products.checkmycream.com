      <li>I just just expecting it to smell more like how Dragon&#x27;s blood resin smells.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It works just it has a way more lavender smell to it than dragon&#x27;s blood.</li>
      <li>There is a bar code glued on top of the original bar code</li>
      <li>Strong scent of dragons blood.</li>
      <li>The best way to describe it is &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; and slightly spicy.</li>

      <li>I had to return the soap as the edges were damaged with one corner significantly dented.</li>

      <li>great for your rough spots..</li>
      <li>I KEEP IT IN MY PURSE FOR A QUICK UPLIFT.</li>
      <li>SOAKS IN QUICK.</li>
      <li>but I wish it absorbed more readily, always have to wipe it off my palms because it&#x27;s like petroleum jelly.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is very moisturizing and smooth and I use it as an all over moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Nice salve, but totally not dragon&#x27;s blood.</li>
      <li>Also, the new screw-top tin is a very welcome improvement, the old ones were a real pain to open.)</li>
      <li>Great product and seems like the container will last a long while, so no worries about the price, its worth it!</li>
      <li>ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM INDIGO WILD, VERY NATURAL, AND ITS ACTUALLY NOT GREASY!</li>

      <li>It has a very dominant lavender scent.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and trouble-free.</li>
      <li>I also really like it on my cuticles.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It takes me about a year of daily use to go through a tin, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price as well.</li>
      <li>Just got a new tattoo...</li>
      <li>/&gt;The reason I purchased the soap and rub is I received a gift of ZUM products and everything looked brand new.</li>
      <li>Then I receive the Dragon&#x27;s Blood Zum Rub and the label is worn on the edges and faded, giving it an old look.</li>
      <li>Indigo Wild, the makers of</li>
      <li>and she said from the Indigo Wild website, so</li>
      <li>I have shopped at Amazon for YEARS and these two products are the first ones that look sketchy, like not new.</li>
      <li>In the future, I will not order these particular products through Amazon.</li>
      <li>really helped heal my dry scaly skin</li>
      <li>The scent is actually very subtle and would go great with any of the other scents listed above.</li>
      <li>My 10 yr old had a rash on his stomach above the waistband that would not go away no matter what I tried.</li>
      <li>I love all natural, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
      <li>If you like Zum&#x27;s other earthy scents like Frankincense &amp; Myrrh (not as sweet), patchouli (not a strong), lavender (not as flowery) or cedar</li>

    <li> Works well controlling my hand and foot eczema but it has a very strong, almost sickening scent. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is another product for healing dry skin.  I love the smell and use this when I have large amounts of skin to heal.</li>
    <li> not as strong smell as the bath salts which i adored!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about the Dragon&#x27;s Blood scent since Zum started hyping it over a year ago (though for some reason they never sent samples of it with my other orders.) The best way to describe it is &amp;#34;woodsy&amp;#34; and slightly spicy. As others have said it is a lot like cedar. If you like Zum&#x27;s other earthy scents like Frankincense &amp; Myrrh (not as sweet), patchouli (not a strong), lavender (not as flowery) or cedar you will probably like their Dragon&#x27;s Blood. The scent is actually very subtle and would go great with any of the other scents listed above. (I like to wear Zum&#x27;s patchouli solid perfume and this goes well with it.) The product itself is very moisturizing and smooth and I use it as an all over moisturizer. It&#x27;s even a great hair product for dry, frizzy hair. It takes me about a year of daily use to go through a tin, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price as well. (I kinda wish they had slightly smaller tins of all the scents so I could try them all! Also, the new screw-top tin is a very welcome improvement, the old ones were a real pain to open.)</li>
    <li> Smells so good and it has done wonders for my cuticles and nails.</li>
    <li> Just got a new tattoo...Zum Rub for the healing process feels so good! I also use it for extreme dryness on elbows, face! Will buy it again!</li>
    <li> Strong scent of dragons blood. If you&#x27;re looking for this scent &amp; a skin moisturizer its perfect for you.</li>
    <li> ANOTHER GREAT PRODUCT FROM INDIGO WILD, VERY NATURAL, AND ITS ACTUALLY NOT GREASY! SOAKS IN QUICK. I KEEP IT IN MY PURSE FOR A QUICK UPLIFT. THE SMELL IS RELAXING</li>
    <li> Stepson loves this stuff, and it does smell really good.</li>
    <li> Highest quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Works as directed with Cansema skin cancer treatment protocol.</li>
    <li> This really feels great on super dry skin, and it smells great. I will be buying more Zum products in the future.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful smelling and feels great on my skin, I have shared some with others that come here.  Not giving these away</li>
    <li> Nice salve, but totally not dragon&#x27;s blood. It has a very dominant lavender scent. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The manufacturer was recommended by a friend as having &amp;#34;really good&amp;#34; body products.  I had tried some of Barb&#x27;s hand rub, etc.  I ordered the Dragon&#x27;s Blood Zum Rub and have used it 2x/dayx4 days.  I am generally slow to heal especially from superficial skin cuts.  This stuff already has all areas healed...I wonder if it comes in a larger container???  Would wholeheartedly recommend.</li>
    <li> This order was a refill from a previuos purchase I made at a specialty store. This product has met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Zum Rub moisturizes very well and smells wonderful.  I would give it 5 stars but I wish it absorbed more readily, always have to wipe it off my palms because it&#x27;s like petroleum jelly.  So when I&#x27;m in a hurry I don&#x27;t use it.  Shipping was fast and trouble-free.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things.  The scent is the best blend I have come accross.  Woody, Spicy.</li>
    <li> really helped heal my dry scaly skin&lt;br /&gt;love  this product...will puchase again.&lt;br /&gt;nice subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;good product....dragon&#x27;s blood really&lt;br /&gt;helped my skin</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry elbows, knees and heels.  I also really like it on my cuticles.  The scent is also very nice.</li>
    <li> My 10 yr old had a rash on his stomach above the waistband that would not go away no matter what I tried. I did not want to go to the dr for Steriod cream, but was just about thinking I was going to have to , and I found this, at a store here in town , it was pricey but I thought it sounds good and doesnt seem to have weird added ingredients that might make matters worse. In just three days the rash is almost gone, I will keep using it til I dont see any trace and maybe a few days after. I have fun asking him , if he wants me to put his Dragons Blood on his belly. He likes that. It does have a woodsy smell I would call it but its not overpowering. I plan to use it on my horribly dry cracked heels and will repost again about that. :) Great product and seems like the container will last a long while, so no worries about the price, its worth it!</li>
    <li> It works just it has a way more lavender smell to it than dragon&#x27;s blood. I just just expecting it to smell more like how Dragon&#x27;s blood resin smells.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I read it was a great help for people who have eczema. It made no difference . Bottom line I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this, it helps his dry skin immensely.</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well.  I love all natural, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> great for your rough spots.. .love the products and the people who provide them.  helping women in poverty hits home for me...I am a supporter of this company&#x27;s mission statement... rock the Kasbah ladies and gentlemen!!!  great products!</li>
    <li> I like it I want to keep it.</li>
    <li> Maybe this only happened to me but I purchased this rub and the Dragon&#x27;s Blood soap as a gift. I had to return the soap as the edges were damaged with one corner significantly dented. Then I receive the Dragon&#x27;s Blood Zum Rub and the label is worn on the edges and faded, giving it an old look. There is a bar code glued on top of the original bar code so I am not certain where this product is coming from, I am thinking not Indigo Wild, the makers of Zum products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I purchased the soap and rub is I received a gift of ZUM products and everything looked brand new. I asked the person who gave them to me where she bought them and she said from the Indigo Wild website, so maybe that is the difference. In the future, I will not order these particular products through Amazon. I have shopped at Amazon for YEARS and these two products are the first ones that look sketchy, like not new.</li>
    <li> Had not done a sniff-test before ordering but I love this fragrance! Highly recommend.</li>
