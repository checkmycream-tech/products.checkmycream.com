    <li> Smells amazing, as does everything Bed Head makes.  Obviously, there is better quality product on the market, but this stuff is definitely worth what you&#x27;re paying for!  I highlight my hair pretty often and this is the shampoo that I use most of the week (on the off days that I&#x27;m not using a mask or more expensive repairing shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This might be a weird thing to touch on, but the pump is great and really easy to use.

    <li> My mother has thing hair, I have thick hair. We both use this product &amp; it works well for both of us. It cleanses without being harsh on my colored/bleached/dry hair. It does not leave build-up either. LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Leaves a film...Liked it at first but as I continued to use, it leaves a film and weighs down my hair.  Won&#x27;t continue to use</li>
    <li> Great shampoo at a great price!</li>
    <li> If you have colored hair or foils this is absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner and really gaurds your hair color.</li>
