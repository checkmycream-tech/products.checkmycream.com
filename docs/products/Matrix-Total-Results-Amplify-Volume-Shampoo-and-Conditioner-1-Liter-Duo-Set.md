      <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>I think it does help with volumizing since I have thinner hair, but honestly I have bought cheap shampoos that had more smell.  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair shine and keep it healthy .</li>
      <li>Never had a product work better.</li>
      <li>I have been using amplify products for more than 20 years.</li>
      <li>Love matrix brand.</li>
      <li>wasn&#x27;t extra impressed with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>I think you will be pleased.</li>
      <li>I want to be able to smell my hair all day and don&#x27;t with this.  </li>
      <li>Gives body and fullness without drying out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>This is a good value too as the bottles are very large.</li>
      <li>Great got my stuff early :)</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend this line for fine hair.</li>
      <li>Buy this if you have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>It is also virtually fragrance free and does not cause any skin irritation for me.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything better for color out there, good blonde and rich darks.  </li>
      <li>This product leaves my hair feeling light and clean and also helps protect my color.</li>
      <li>I really like the price of this shampoo and conditioner and think it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>I use it for special occassions.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and it lasts.  </li>
      <li>Shopping for such items here in Juneau can be very costly, so I hope Amazon will always be able to sell this at such a good price.</li>
      <li>I use the conditioner first</li>
      <li>I have chemical sensitivity and most of the regular brand shampoos sold in grocery stores and pharmacies irritate my scalp.  </li>
      <li>This gives me the right amount of volume without drying out my hair too much.  </li>
      <li>My hair is baby fine and is weighted down easily by shampoo products.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel full of body and not limp at all.  </li>
      <li>Had hoped for better results based on reviews, but it seemed to dry out my hair.  </li>
      <li>and I love the way it looks and feels after I dry and style it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it did much in terms of volume for my fine/straight hair.</li>
      <li>and it really helps me.</li>
      <li>Have discontinued using it for a much cheaper store brand for color treated hair.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for volume, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or dry it out.  </li>
      <li>, then shampoo, then use Joico Gel medium and my hair is fluffy and has body.&lt;br /&gt;it is not flat, dry or fly away!!</li>
      <li>Girls, if you have fine or thinning hair, this shampoo WILL help without weighing your hair down.</li>
      <li>, i will definitely buy this product again, thanks</li>
      <li>Naturally it does not work miracles nor does it regrow hair, but it definitely gives thickness and fullness to limp fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have flat straight Asian hair.</li>
      <li>Volume shampoos generally are.  </li>
      <li>So, I think that the product delivers what it is supposed to concerning volumizing, but as far as a great smell, it disappointed me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m at my 4th round of the shampoo and conditioner because it really works!</li>
      <li>And it really weights my hair down.</li>

<li> Gives the boost of extra volume without leaving your hair feeling heavy and rough/dry.</li>
<li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner because I hate when products leave my hair feeling heavy and weighed down.  </li>
<li> The lids shut tightly to stop any leaks if they get tipped over.</li>
<li> green bottle stuff and not the amplify volume.</li>
<li> so I had tried some small bottles.  </li>
<li> Waste of money!</li>
<li> The alterna products i was using have been discontinued or very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I have thin hair</li>
<li> It was recommended to me because I have very thin oily hair.</li>
<li> Not so crazy about this product.  </li>
<li> I am disappointed in the subtleness of the fragrance.  </li>
<li> Smells awful like chemicals.</li>

    <li> I love the Matrix hair products! I use this line on my child&#x27;s hair. There is no greasy residue and whether they shampoo the night before or the day of an event their hair looks amazing all time. I strongly recommend this line for fine hair. We will purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like the price of this shampoo and conditioner and think it works pretty good. I use an oil after I shower to help comb through it.</li>

    <li> I have used this product for a long time.  I try other products and always go back to this one.  I have thin hair and it really helps me.</li>
    <li> it has no root lifting effect for me, instead, I have a litter allergic reflection. And it really weights my hair down.</li>
    <li> This shampoo &amp; conditioner is great for volume, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or dry it out.  I have found it on amazon for great price !!</li>
    <li> Love matrix brand. This is great shampoo and conditioner. My hair smells great and I love the way it looks and feels after I dry and style it.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything better for color out there, good blonde and rich darks.  The scent is fresh and it lasts.  It is as another reviewer said a bit drying. Volume shampoos generally are.  I use it for special occassions.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner because I hate when products leave my hair feeling heavy and weighed down.  This product leaves my hair feeling light and clean and also helps protect my color.</li>
    <li> Great got my stuff early :)</li>
    <li> great product and price, this beats salon prices as well as retail, i will definitely buy this product again, thanks</li>
    <li> Where has this shampoo been all my life?  I have extremely fine, but thick hair and have difficulty finding a shampoo that does not weigh my hair down and make it limp.  Recently my regular shampoo was discontinued, forcing me to search for a replacement.  I have chemical sensitivity and most of the regular brand shampoos sold in grocery stores and pharmacies irritate my scalp.  My hairdresser recommended this brand and I absolutely love it! It makes my hair feel full of body and not limp at all.  It is also virtually fragrance free and does not cause any skin irritation for me.  This is a good value too as the bottles are very large.</li>
    <li> Shipped in two days. Product is great for mt thinning hair.  I. Also use boost by Matrix and it is wonderful.  Gives my hair fullness.  No matting.</li>
    <li> This duo is a great size combo for a great price. The lids shut tightly to stop any leaks if they get tipped over.</li>
    <li> great value....same quality as if purchased at a salon...</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t extra impressed with the conditioner.</li>
    <li> worked very well for volume but completed dried out my hair to the point I stopped using this product</li>
    <li> I always buy this at my salon.  When I found it a lot bigger in size and cheaper had to get it.  Very good product . Fast delivery</li>
    <li> I orderd this shampoo because I had brought it from my hair dresser and like the way it made my hair feel.It was recommended to me because I have very thin oily hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
    <li> I have been using amplify products for more than 20 years. Never had a product work better. Makes my hair shine and keep it healthy .</li>
    <li> My hairdresser suggested this product so I had tried some small bottles.  My hair is baby fine and is weighted down easily by shampoo products.  The alterna products i was using have been discontinued or very hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product.  I use the conditioner first, then shampoo, then use Joico Gel medium and my hair is fluffy and has body.&lt;br /&gt;it is not flat, dry or fly away!!</li>
    <li> Great Price for Matrix Shampoo and conditioner.  I regularly buy these on amazon now.</li>
    <li> Smells awful like chemicals. Waste of money!</li>
    <li> This product works very good for fine hair.  Gives body and fullness without drying out your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> So happy to have found this at such a wonderful price!!  Shopping for such items here in Juneau can be very costly, so I hope Amazon will always be able to sell this at such a good price.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner!! Will for sure buy again smells great! The conditioner is not to much but not to little either!</li>
    <li> I ordered this brand based off my stylist&#x27;s recommendations and it didn&#x27;t turn out quite as expected. I think my stylist meant for me to get the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; green bottle stuff and not the amplify volume. My fiancee and I both noticed that this made our hair oilier and somewhat itchy. I don&#x27;t think it did much in terms of volume for my fine/straight hair. We ended up chucking this out after a handful of uses.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have lots of hair but it is very fine.  This product keeps me from having &amp;#34;flat&amp;#34; hair.  You also need to purchase this brand of root lifter that you spray on your roots prior to drying your hair.  I think you will be pleased.</li>
    <li> I was so pleased to find this shampoo on Amazon. PLEASE keep it in stock, as I have been looking everywhere for Amplify and have a hard time finding just the right ones. Girls, if you have fine or thinning hair, this shampoo WILL help without weighing your hair down. Naturally it does not work miracles nor does it regrow hair, but it definitely gives thickness and fullness to limp fine hair.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use the conditioner but the shampoo is really amazing! Definitely noticed my hair get fuller and stronger. Great CLEAN smell also!</li>
    <li> Great product and super price! Will definitely buy from again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely Love This Product!!!!  Have always had fine thin hair and this one helps me a lot!</li>
