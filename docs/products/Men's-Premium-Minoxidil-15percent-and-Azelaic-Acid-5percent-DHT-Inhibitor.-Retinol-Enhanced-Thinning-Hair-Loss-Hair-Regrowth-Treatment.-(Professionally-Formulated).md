      <li>Good product, been using now for 10 weeks.</li>
      <li>But then i read on the internet that some people experience good results with minoxidil... which eventually led me to this product.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for 6 months now and I clearly see the reduction of my hair loss after shower. Normally I could find 15-20 hairs on the sink but now only 1-2 hairs. Great product for preventing your hair loss!</li>
    <li> I originally gave this product a poor review, but I was perhaps overreacting.  Using this product made my head feel strange and dizzy.  At first I didn&#x27;t even connect the two, so I wouldn&#x27;t say the effect arose due to a paranoid expectation.  I didn&#x27;t use the product long enough to find out if it works, but many seem to say it does.  I can simply urge you to make an informed decision and always remember that medication is best used with consideration to doctoral advice.  Most all medications have the chance that some people, even if very few, will experience side effects.  I can mention that using the product was simple and easy to use, and didn&#x27;t have any last smell that I could detect.</li>
    <li> expensive and ineffective   used for 3 months and nothing happened.   feeling dizzy sometime.      i am going back to rogaine.</li>
    <li> This is my first bottle of this product (I&#x27;ve used 2% Rogaine before), so I haven&#x27;t noticed results yet. What I have noticed is that using the recommended amount will yield just over 30 days of product (less than advertised). My biggest problem with this product though is that if you have any hair on top (which I do), it will mat in your hair like glue. This makes it unuseable for me in the morning before going to work. I now have to use a different minoxidil for daytime, and this product at night. If it fills in the thinning area, I guess it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s kind of a hassle, though.</li>
    <li> This is the best product out there by far. I was an individual who suffered from frontal hairline loss. I had minor hair loss and wanted something that worked. I heard previously that most minoxidil products only worked or were tested in certain areas excluding the frontal hairline. I was disappointed with my discovery until I came upon Amazon and read about this product. Due to the positive reviews I decided to try this product out. A month later I have had amazing results. I still can&#x27;t believe it. I have real hair growing back and I notice newer hairs are also coming in. I am very very happy with the results of this product and highly encourage anyone out there to try it. I am 100% positive that it will work for you without an doubt. To those who are saying it doesn&#x27;t work are not giving the product enough time. It took me about a month to see a noticeable change and it will take even longer then that to fully see the power of this product. I am satisfied with even the minimal results that I have received and can&#x27;t wait for the future. The quality and price of this product simply can&#x27;t be beat. It&#x27;s very affordable and It beats every other minoxidil product out there.     I again encourage anyone out there to try this product! If you want your hair back in your frontal region as well as the back then this is the product for you. I stand by this product after my results in simply a month and will remain a permanent customer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 months now with little or no result.    My state: full head of hair with receding hairline only in the front (and not that deep - about Matt Damon&#x27;s current condition). So it may not be all that bad, but we all judge ourselves mostly on how we looked 3, 4 years ago and I had much, much better hair.    Form and feel:     I don&#x27;t care that it dries out or whatever because all that matters to me is results. I haven&#x27;t experienced any headache or significant irritation because of it. It does itch a little bit every now and then but as I said, I can put up with that (it&#x27;s a common problem with all minoxidil products).    Usage:     I&#x27;ve been using minoxidil products on and off for the last 7 years. It seems as though they no longer have any potency over my body in spite of being diligent - applying it liberally, twice a day. My usage is still only about 8,9 drops each application and 1 bottle would last for at least 4 months.      Results:    3 months later I have little tangible growth.  I&#x27;ve been ambivalent about leaving a review so far because products like this work for some and don&#x27;t for others. So I don&#x27;t want to discourage others who maybe thinning in the crown areas. Minoxidil, as many researches suggest, works best in the deeper areas. But if you&#x27;re like me, don&#x27;t be disappointed if it doesn&#x27;t work wonders even after extensive use. 3 months later even the possible placebo effect is reversed because now you&#x27;re somewhat depressed about not being able to bring the hair back.    Conclusion:    I&#x27;m not disappointed in the product per se. I&#x27;m just giving up on minoxidil altogether. I bought two bottles and it should go for another 5 months or so. So if I happen to be a &#x27;late bloomer&#x27; I&#x27;ll come back and update the review here.     We spend 10 bucks on a single half-decent lunch. So it&#x27;s not a lot of money. I&#x27;d say give it try. Best case, you got some hair back, worst case you cook 3 meals at home to make up for the money spent onthis.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I am 20 years old, and until this product, I was experiencing a receding hairline. My hairline just started to recede a year ago. When I noticed my hairline starting to inch back, I decided to do some research. I found this product and decided to give it a try. 4 months later and NO regrets. My hairline is back to where it was before I started losing it. I can give my proactive measures thanks for my AWESOME results. Bottom line, this is a great product for regrowing hair and stopping future loss.</li>
    <li> I dont normally review products, but i felt the nature of this product required as much review as possible.    I&#x27;m a 23 year old male that began to notice a rapid thinning of the hair on my crown, to the point that my scalp was clearly visible from behind, and beginning to show from the front. As someone that&#x27;s always had long hair, i couldn&#x27;t decide if i should cut it short or off entirely, or just leave it as it is and hope for the best. But then i read on the internet that some people experience good results with minoxidil... which eventually led me to this product.    Now this product is a little pricier than competing products, and i can&#x27;t really make any other comparisons to them having never used them, but i chose this one as it had the highest minoxidil content, and their product, packaging, descriptions, communication etc were all very professional looking compared to others (first impressions mean everything). The delivery was a little slow, but that&#x27;s more a product of inefficient global postal services than anything these guys have done. When i finally get the product, it comes with instructions and a good quality glass applicator thats easy to use.    I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and a half, in combination with the hair regrowth shampoo and as of yet i have seen no growth in my thinning areas, however after an initial period of shedding (about 3 weeks) i find my hair loss seems to have stopped completely. prior to using this product i would run my hand through my hair and find 10-20 hairs tangled up in my hands, or would have to pull big chunks of hair out of my brush every few days. Since about 3 weeks ago though, i can run my hands through my hair without any hair falling out, at most brushing my hair after a shower only results in maybe 2-5 hairs in my brush. Also i feel like areas of my scalp that i didnt think were thinning at all are starting to look a little darker and thicker, with lots of little hairs sprouting up and existing hairs lookingthicker and healthier. none on my serious balding spots but if it&#x27;s having some effect (it could just be my imagination) on the healthier parts of my scalp, maybe its a good sign of things to come. At any rate, i&#x27;m very happy just knowing the hair loss has stopped or at least slowed to a crawl for that alone it&#x27;s worth the price they&#x27;re asking. And i&#x27;ll update this review in a few months with my results, but what i&#x27;ve seen so far has given me hope.    As for the negative side-effects i&#x27;ve seen people complain about, i havent really experienced anything negative, i got a couple of headaches early on but i&#x27;m not sure if they were related to my usage of minoxidil or not. i havent found it to be too greasy or sticky, and have been able to just drop it on and like 5 minutes later its as if it was never there at all. so thats been good. it did make my hair all stiff and clump together once but that was when i used it after a shower while my hair was still wet, i find it works perfectly if you do it when your hair/scalp are completely dry (i believe something to this effect is actually stated in the instructions).    Pros:  - Good Quality  - Highest concentration of minoxidil available  - Easy to apply to your scalp, not too greasy/stick    Cons:  - A little expensive  - Not a magic cure to hair loss.    Also, a suggestion to the seller: i&#x27;d probably be willing to pay for a hair growth nutrient supplement of equal quality to your existing products, as i hear people have some luck with biotin and saw palmetto extract and such.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with hair loss for almost 35 years.  After a hair transplant, I noticed I was losing hair again, so my dermatologist recommended using the Hairmax laser. This takes about 4 months to cause new hair growth.  At the same time, I started the Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15%.  Before, the Hairmax laser had any effect, this stronger Minoxidil solution reversed my hair loss and my hair got thicker.  A very good product that I intend to continue using.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent .... REALLY THE BEST OF THE BEST .... no more words to say I recommen[[ASIN:B003CHYPCW Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% DHT Inhibitor. Retinol Enhanced Thinning Hair Loss / Hair Regrowth Treatment. (Professionally Formulated)]]d it with eyes closed</li>
    <li> makes hair stand up straight and stiff like in the movie \\&quot;There&#x27;s Something about Mary\\&quot; hair scene.  Too early to tell if works or not for the hair on my head. the hair on my balls grew rapidly overnight, fast shipping. would recommend so far.    update: seems to be growing hair on front of scalp, working great!!!! a few hairs on balls now over 15\\&quot; in length. will update again in a few months. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only 25% of the way through the bottle, but I have been taking minoxidil 5% for one month prior to this. My hair already seems to have more life, bounce whereas before it was flat and lifeless at the front, I notice random thick hairs have appeared that I didn&#x27;t see before. Bearing in mind that you shouldn&#x27;t expect to see any results from this for 3 months, I am optimistic for the future. The product is thick and gloopy and does leave a thin film on your scalp, but it has not irritated my scalp or caused any kind of sensations. Obviously it isn&#x27;t ideal to have sticky gloop on your scalp when you go to work but nor is having thinning hair and given the choice I am happy to suffer this minor aesthetic annoyance for as long as it takes to regenerate. I am dosing in the morning and evening now, but I plan to drop down to evening only once full regeneration has happened which I anticipate will be in about 6 months and will update then. You need to be careful buying any kind of pharmaceuticals off of the net and this seller passed the smell test for me and now the product is working. Forget crappy expensive foams and rip offs like the belgradia centre wanting hundreds of pounds, this is all you need.</li>
    <li> Hello. I put a five star rating for a reason. People tend to want to look at reviews that are good and avoid the bad reviews. I know because that is what I did. I purchased this product 3 months ago and used it twice a day. I used three bottles and let me tell you what happens. When You apply it it leaves your hair sooooooo greasy and it stays like that for about 8 hours and it runs down to the face. It is also very sticky and hard to get off at shower. But the bad part was that it made my hair sooooo much. I have tried biotin, Nioxin vitamins, Nioxin Shampoo and cond. Non work However I am starting to see GREAT results with rogain foam. It took about six months but it works great and dries in about 4 minutes. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I also read that the FDA did not approved for hair loss. Stay away. Please learn the lesson from me. and no I don&#x27;t work for any company.   Everyone good luck</li>
    <li> Use it or loose it -- as the commercial goes.. This is a great product in the fact that it&#x27;s not sticky after application and dries quickly! (like super rogain but without the slow drying time and sicky ness) --- heard good things about the the Azelaic Acid!</li>
    <li> Was very skeptical! I only used it at night and i still had very positive results! I would defiantly recommend this to anymore</li>
    <li> Just started lossing hair in the crown area (thinning) tired of friends touching the spot and saying your getting a boldspot!  No !#@!, Trying not to except it! Oh Yeah, I&#x27;m 43, I bought the 15% Minoxidil and I also use a DHT inhibiting shampoo [[ASIN:B004X34T4S Hair Loss/ Regrowth Shampoo -Enhanced w/ Ketoconazole DHT Inhibitor, Saw palmetto, emu oil, biotin &amp; Scalp Exfoliating Agent Salicylic Acid for Greater Minoxidil Penetration 6oz / 180mL]] and conditioner with biotin [[ASIN:B000IZA1NS Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner 14 Ounces]].  But if this can grow my hair and beat back baldness I&#x27;ll try it. Had for a week aready see new strands of hair peach fuzz.  The product is sticky but give at least 3hr to completely dry and if it&#x27;s running down your face. Your useing to much in one spot dabble on and rub/spread in small circles. I did recieve it ahead of do date about by 7 day&#x27;s.   And for you young guy&#x27;s 20&#x27;s, 30&#x27;s, If you are lossing your hair early, HIGH LEVELS OF DHT in your body will wreak havoc and attach on to your hair follicle root&#x27;s and your prostate. DHT blockers and prostate health pill will help.   Good Luck and God Bless</li>
    <li> I started to use this product about two months ago and since I have observed a much visible improvement. this product is 100% more effective than Rogaine and other products out there. I tried to reorder today and to my surprise. the company is no longer in business. I hope is just temporal and they re lunch this great product again maybe under a different name, I don&#x27;t care. I just need to have this product available for all of us that saw results and got our hopes up.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe the fda discontinued this product.  I swear this is the only product that worked for me and now its gone.  I wish I could do something.  I&#x27;ve been looking into figuring out who to send letters to.  Really upset that its gone and only 5% is now available.</li>
    <li> it works @!!! it works it works !!!! its the best out there, I used it for two years before the FDA had them take it off the market ! I saw great results on the front and the back...and thank GOD I am just in need of small dosage because my spots are small. now very small.....and NOW WHAT ??? what the hell am I gonna buy ?? Why the FDA doesn&#x27;t&#x27; make a product than ???? so disappointed I want to scream !!!!!!! I had no rush, no itch, no redness, no heart palpitation, nothing of those side effect.  Damn it !</li>
    <li> I have been using 5% minoxidil for over 3 years, provillus and rogain, and didn&#x27;t see hair regrowth but I believe they did help me control hair fall a little. In 5% minoxidil, I would vote for provillus..very less or no itch and made hair look healthier. I randomly came across Perfect Image&#x27;s 15% minoxidil in amazon and till then I didn&#x27;t even realize that there was a 15% minoxidil formula. Looking at the positive reviews, I ordered a bottle. I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in the first month, but continued using for another 2 months. After 3 months, my friends were the first to tell me that my hair looked very healthy and thicker. My hairdresser was very surprised..she showed me all the baby hair in the crown and the frontal hairline. Its been 6 months now and the baby hair has grown thicker, and I am seeing more baby hair in the frontal hairline. This product never caused itchy scalp to me.  On the cons, it is expensive and the solution makes hair stiff and lumpy. Once it dries out, it is impossible to comb, forget about going out. I apply it every night before going to bed and use Jason Natural think to thick shampoo to wash my hair every morning. I would recommend this regime to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was using another off brand purchased from a department store and that product was 5% minoxidil. I experienced about 15% increase in hair re growth with that product. I would like to see more re growth so I purchased perfect hair solution and have been using it for approximately six weeks with no visable change. I am considering going back to my previous product since it is less expensive and seem to work as good as perfect hair solutions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two months and my hair is coming back.  I was desperate, the thinning hair was clearly showing, any breeze was enough to make me panic!  There are very few problems that affect a woman as much as hair loss, and buying this product was my last attempt before shaving my head and wearing a wig for good.  Now, after years of shame, wasteful and expensive treatments, even a hair transplant, I found a product that is helping me.  My head is full of new hair growing and even my temples have an unwelcoming hair growth due to my unnecessary  massage in the area.  However, I dont care, I know it will go away as I restrain my enthusiasm and do not use the product very close to the area.  It is a relief to comb my hair and see it is not all over the floor.  I will be travelling abroad soon and will bring along bottles of this product to my brothers.</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from male pattern baldness for some time. After being bombarded with countless TV ads promessing you to give your hair back, I, like many, didn&#x27;t really have high hopes for any current of future miraclous product. That until this thing arrived. This product really works. My Doctor has been keeping my progress for a year now, confirming what friends and family are noticing already, my hair is growing back again. If possible, combine it with some specialized shampoo like [[ASIN:B002UD52WQ DS Laboratories Revita Hair Growth Stimulating Shampoo, 290-gram Bottle]].</li>
    <li> The product may work but like vitamins you never really seem to know. The problem is that when it dries it makes your hair dry and sticky. It&#x27;s as if you put a ton of hair spray on that area of your head. Unfortunately cannot recommend.</li>
    <li> First time buying 15% Minoxidil, been using the 5% for years.  I&#x27;ve only used this product three times so don&#x27;t know if it actually grows hair better.  However, I know one thing for sure: It&#x27;s very sticky.  I can only use it at bedtime because cannot go through the day with it on my hair... and even at bedtime if anyone, wife, partner, etc., plans on touching your hair you can forget about any hanky panky.</li>
    <li> I was using 5% until I came across this product which is the ONLY one that uses 15%. I can tell it&#x27;s definitely stronger than the other one I was using. When applying it to your scalp, make sure you don&#x27;t get too much of it on your hair. The solution will make your hair harden and feel a bit odd. I advise you to use this product only at night otherwise it could affect your hair during the day (if you&#x27;re not wearing a hat or something).    Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Two months and still working.  Excellent product and speedy delivery.  Try it for a month and see what you think!</li>
    <li> you have to keep using this for it to work its less greasy then the monaxodil alone</li>
    <li> My previous review of this product disappeared after a few days, so I will repeat, this is a very oily / greasy substance that takes forever to dry.  The company claims it changed its name from Perfect Hair Solutions to Perfect Image Solutions.  That may be the case, but this is not the same product.  I used Perfect Hair Solutions with 15% Minoxidil and 5% Azelaic acid for over a year and had no problems with drying time.      I am not sure about the effectiveness of this product, it may work just as well as the quick drying version of Perfect Hair Solutions, but drying time is a problem.  If this is the same company, perhaps they can bring back the old quick drying version for customers who don&#x27;t have three hours to wait for the mixture to dry on their heads.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd bottle of Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidl 15% with add ons and each month progress in hair growth is shown. I spent a small fortune on presriptions and across the counter products with minimal results. This products works for me and shows improvement in hair growth each month. Ordered thru Amazon with very fast delivery from vendor.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my scalp turn red and itchy.  I think it is the propylene glycol in it.  It may be good for some people but if you have a sensitivity to it then watch out.</li>
    <li> i have never written a review for anything ever before.  dont have time and too lazy too.  but knowing how much angst and frustration baldness causes me and other bald men i had to write a review for this product.  i am 28 yrs old and have tried a variety of products over the past 7-8 yrs from the laser hair brush to most recently rogaine and none have had any significant effect of my hair maintenance or hair growth.  out of shear luck i found this product 3 months ago and have been using it twice a day like the company recommends.  not only has the health of my scalp improved and the hair i had been maintained but i have grown new hair.  and not just some peach fuzz but legitimate new hair.  i have taken pictures every month and everytime i look at the pictures it never ceases to make me happy.  i am a currently a medical resident and realize maybe more than most that each patient reacts differently to a medication but i would def recommend giving this product a try for atleast a month or 2.  goodluck</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail. I am really nervous to open it up and use it. I&#x27;m 28 and have been on 5% for years. Initially it worked great, but I think as time has gone on it&#x27;s effects aren&#x27;t as great. I still got a pretty good amount of hair, but def thinner in some areas. I think 5% is now helping me keep what I have or maybe improves my situation a little bit.     After almost all positive reviews I bought this. I&#x27;m just skeptical after a ton of Google searches I&#x27;ve seen nothing concrete on this product or anything above 5% working. And if it was that black and white, why is it not on store shelves at 15%?     Are there any real reviews (skeptical if the 5 star ones are real). My primary fear is not that this wont improve thickness, but that I&#x27;ll actually shed a ton more hair and worsen the situation as has been reported by a few people. Any insight would be great appreciated as I don&#x27;t want to do anything to increase shedding.     ***If I end up taking this product, I will give a more accurate rating, but since I am just now looking for information, I had to rate it something to post this. ***</li>
    <li> Seems to work, not sure how much better it works than 5% minox though. I stopped using it when I got some Rogaine foam, which is much easier to apply, but will start using it again once my foam runs out. I&#x27;ve only been using minox for about three months, so my feedback prolly should not be given much weight.</li>
    <li> Hi guys!    I was waiting for more than 3 months to write that review and I can definetely say that this product works and it&#x60;s is absolutely worth its cost. The hair loss is now significantly reduced, the product does really regrow hair and the quality of your hair will unbelievably improve. The only bad thing is that you have to use it twice a day for three mnths at least. First my hair were like a little wax covered and looked soiled, but I&#x60;ve found a soulution to avoid such inconvenience. You have to find a very small soft plasic bottle (much better than that dropper) with a nozzle for direct-onto-scalp application, so using that bottle you will avoid soiling hair and you can work all the scalp area thoroughly. If you do it with zig-zag movements that will work even better. Good luck!</li>
    <li> This product really worked wonders on my hair line! more than the crown actually but it did fill in that area a bit too. I made a big mistake while i was getting great results from perfect image 15% though and that was trying Revita shampoo, which proved to be DISASTROUS!! Something in that shampoo made my hair thinner and worse than ever! hoping that the 15% minox brings it back again. big thumbs up to perfect image for a very good product!</li>
    <li> When I began even losing a little bit of my hair I took an aggressive approach to it. My routine includes this product and it really helps. 5 stars people come and get it ^-^</li>
    <li> The 15% formula with Azelaic Acid 5% works well when used regularly. One bottle can last 60 days if you only use this 1x a day and another product for the other dose, but I choose to use it twice a day and keep watching for renewed scalp health and new results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two months but I can already see a difference.  I&#x27;ve used other products but none of them gave me results this quickly, nor did they give me the results they advertise after the minimum time-frame and longer.  Finally, I feel like there&#x27;s a product that will actually regrow my hair and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few more months.</li>
    <li> Update January 3, 2012...I hate to say it but this product has changed from when I wrote my original review. The product now is so sticky and oily that it&#x27;s hard to use on a daily basis and consequently hard to tell whether it is still working or not. The formulation when I wrote the review last April was more powdery when it dried and worked more like a hair product.   Original Review April 2010:  I&#x27;ve used Rogaine Extra Strength for years with minimal results. With much skepticism...I decided to give this a try. Glad I did...this stuff works!</li>
    <li> After surviving until age 62 with minimal loss of hair, I started to notice some loss in front more on the left side than right [which makes the loss look worse]. I suspect that the hair loss is due to one of the medications I have been taking the past 4 years.    I researched and read as much as I could about Minoxidil [it had to be affordable] and foam vs liquid. I selected liquid and the 15% strength after reading reviews online.    Now after nearly a month of use once or twice each day, I&#x27;m pretty certain that I&#x27;m seeing noticeable hair regrowth in the problem areas. If the result continues, I will be very pleased with the result and will continue it&#x27;s use. I&#x27;ve tried to follow the directions carefully.    I have to say that I would even now recommend this version to give it a shot. Perfect Image Solutions delivered promptly and the price is definitely right.    Bill</li>
    <li> I consider this the best hair growth product out there for its effectiveness and cost.  I apply a small amount to the area at night only. It takes a whole minute. I like keeping things simple, and this stuff is very easy to use.       It&#x27;s now been about 9 months since I started using it, and I&#x27;m impressed with the results. I had thinning hair around my temples and hairline, and decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;m 35 now. I have noticed SIGNIFICANT hair growth in the previously sparse areas, and am quite pleased. Don&#x27;t expect the same hairline you had when you were 20, but I give a lot of credit to this product. It&#x27;s a slow and steady process, so you need to be patient.       But here are a few things that will increase your chances. If you can manage to do the following, it might help:      - You might want to start taking a multi-vitamin (unless you really enjoy salads and brussels sprouts with your pizza and beer).     - any hair products with sodium lauryl sulfate in it will strip your hair of its natural oils. That stuff sucks, and it&#x27;s in nearly everything. Google it.   - Keep it simple. Leave the fancy products to the wife or girlfriend, and use castile soap or diluted apple cider vinegar for shampoo. But not every day. How dirty does your hair get on a daily basis? For most of us, not very much.     Good luck.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually even write reviews but this product has compelled me to because it actually works! I have used (non-Perfect Image) Minoxidil 5% for a long time along with Nizoral shampoo. It&#x27;s kept my hair in but no real regrowth at the frontal scalp area. (I don&#x27;t have the bald spot in back).   But I started using the Minoxidil 15% / Azelaic Acid 5% along with the Enhanced Regrowth Shampoo and have noticed regrowth in under a month. I was surprised that I was actually seeing fill-in near the widow&#x27;s peak. But this is definitely a step up. It&#x27;s not oily like those other minoxidil products. It doesn&#x27;t look like you have grease or sweat lacing your hair. It dries but you still can feel it for a while but not see it. It&#x27;s not irritating like oily products can be and still doesn&#x27;t run like a more liquid product. And again, I&#x27;m seeing significant regrowth.  As close to perfect as it gets. Good job in making the product!</li>
    <li> It is really working. I have been working this product for 6 months. I am really happy because my hair grows..</li>
    <li> Dear Sir or Mam I just wanted to let you know that i have had amazing results from using the 15% monoxidil with Azeleic acid.I also use your 5ar inhibitor shampoo and work it in really well and let it sit for 3 minutes before i towel dry my scalp and hair and apply the formula.I supplement this regimen with 2 daily servings of saw palmetto with pygeum and 1 daily dose of beta sytosterol.The image attached shows me on the left before begining treatment and on the left side after 3 and a half weeks of use.     [...]</li>
    <li> So far this product has worked well for me (About 3 weeks at this point, I will update as time goes on) . My skin is not irritated, and I am noticing that my hairline seems to be coming back in short little hairs. Let me give you some background for context because this may help determine if this product might work for you. I started noticing that my hair was receding when I was 24 (I am now 26). It seemed to be receding more on my left temple, than my right (where I used to part my hair). I am the youngest of my 3 brothers, my brother just older than me has a pretty bad widows peak so I am a little paranoid that it would happen to me (My older brothers have moderate hair loss around the crown, but my next oldest brother has it the worst). I would continue to see a slow amount of receding around the crown of my hair. After about 8 months of this, I ordered the Nioxin system 1 which I think started to slow the hair loss a little and cover up some of the receding by puffing up the hair to cover up the crown. About a year later, I continued to see some thinning out of the hairs on the front of my head so I ordered the Nioxin vitamin pills. Honestly, I think it made it worse as I seemed to be losing more on the right crown area. I ceased taking them about a month after I bought them. This continued for another 6 months.   Then I purchased this product as a last ditch effort to slow it down, and hopefully regain some of my hair line. So far, it seems to be working because my hair seems to be thickening up some in the front, and my crown is starting to fill in a little at a time. I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding yet, so I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it will stay that way. So right now I use a Q-tip to rub the product through my hair. Once it dries, it does not feel greasy or sticky. In the morning I wash my hair with Nioxin system 1 shampoo and conditioner and it works great. You wouldn&#x27;t even know it was ever there. Oh and I pray often that this product will work, and visualize myself often with the hairline that I dream of.  Most products are more effective if you believe it will work. I also am fairly physically active, which likely stimulates blood flow through the head. Another thing to keep in mind is that your hair follicles are not \\&quot;dead\\&quot;, they have just gone into a resting state. The idea behind this product is that it helps bring blood flow back to those resting hair follicles, which gets them starting their cycles again. Overall, I think this product would benefit those of us who are just starting to lose hair around the crown. If you are already in the advanced stages of male pattern hair loss, it may not be much help to you. Best of luck! And I recommend that you start this sooner than later.</li>
    <li> Received the above item in great conditions, I am very happy and I thank you very much the above company that sent the above tool  that I could repair what I needed to do as soon as possible. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> After using rogaine and not getting the results, I did some research and found this product. My follicles started growing thicker and my head looks a lot darker and is not as obvious. I highly recommend this product for anyone wanting to gain or regain their hair. It does take some time for it to grow back and does take some dedication to apply in the morning and at night.</li>
    <li> Tried rogaine without success aside from just some peach fuzz after 2 months, now this product within a weeks time and I already have peach fuzz. So far so good. I&#x27;m also using it in conjugation with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using the 15% perfect image solutions for more than one months. What happened on my scalp is really amazing. In the past four years I have been trying to use many kinds of medicine to save my hair, however, obviously most of them not work as effective as perfect image solutions. I am enjoying the happiness to see my hair grows out and becoming thicker and stronger.  Thank you so much perfect image solutions, I hope to see more miracle from you.  Jiang.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my hair line for about 7 months and so far have had pretty negative results. Until about 2 months ago I was using it once a day. Not getting the results I was hoping for, I upped the application to twice a day and started using the Perfect Image Hair Regrowth Shampoo. I&#x27;ve been shedding quite a bit since I started using minoxidil 7 months ago and it has really made my hair loss a lot more noticeable. It is not making my scalp itch or burn or anything so I do not think it&#x27;s an allergic reaction. Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I start this using this product around 3 months ago. On the very first day i took picture of my hair to compare it in future and see results. But now i know even need pictures from past to see result. i can see remarkable new hair growth on my head. Few people are complaining about dandruff, but its not dandruff. After applying this product for 3 or 4 times without washing ur hair with shampoo, minoxodil will get dry and look like dandruff. I was my hair with shampoo every day after applying this product 2 times. And still i see a lot of improvement. Soon a point will come when i will have to minimize the use of this product to not grow hair more than what i want. Also in order to keep hair on head u have to use this product indefinately and i think spending $40 buck + $20 for shampoo and vitamins every month is quite too much. This is an request to seller i think u should give some discount to people who are buying this product every month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young black male whos been suffering from early MPB since I turned 20 (currently 23). By my 22 birthday my thinning hairline had become discernible enough to warrant comments by both friends and family, and 6 months after my birthday I had pretty much lost all of my hair in the right frontal area, and my left frontal area was severely thinned out.  I tried several products to help conceal my balding, including Caboki, which worked great until someone touched the application spot, or I tried to style my hair in any way. I began using this product 5 months ago. My first month of use showed little signs of improvement, and I honestly began to doubt the usefulness of the sticky yellow liquid I was putting on my scalp, but 2 and a half months in and, lo and behold, my left frontal looked like it did when I was 18 and right frontal area (which was damn near completely bald) was filled in enough for me to cut my hair and not notice any balding whatsoever. 5 months in and I literally have a full head of hair like I did when I was a teenager, thick and all. It feels good to know that I can style my hair the way I want to instead of being limited to cutting my hair very short or shaving it bald.   Pros:   *Non offensive smell  *Easy application  *IT WORKS  Cons:  *Takes a while to see results  *Product is sticky, and may flake if you add too much  Even with the cons this products has going against it, Perfect Image Solutions&#x27; 15% Minoxidil still warrants a five star rating for the simple fact that IT WORKS (in my experience at least). Mind you, I might have to use this product for the rest of my life, but having to buy 2 or 3 bottles a year vs hair transplant surgery is a sacrifice I&#x27;ll gladly make.</li>
    <li> There is not words! It absolutely magic! I have been used it for three months and I can see the difference!</li>
    <li> I posted earlier before I&#x27;d had a chance to use this. I&#x27;ve used it now and it works well. I was suffering only a slight hairline recession but overall thinning across the top. My hair has always been thin but I had enough for naturally curly hair (not tight curls but enough to wear a little long/casual). Thinning out meant not enough hair to group into a curl so I acted. After only 6 weeks I noticed new hair coming in; sparsely but sooner than I&#x27;d expected.   I believe this product has stopped hair loss and has indeed encouraged some new growth. I only apply once a day, at night and have missed days at a time. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t wait for significant hair loss before starting this regiment. About 6 months now and my hair is not quite the same but definitely doesn&#x27;t look thinned out anymore! I&#x27;m very pleased at the results.</li>
    <li> My hair started to thin.  Used Perfect Image and its regrowing, almost back to its former self.   Use it and see the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for just about a month now.  I am somewhat amazed as there seems to be actual hair regrowth on the areas of my scalp that I&#x27;ve been applying it!  I&#x27;m using this in combination with Nizoral shampoo about three times per week and am quite pleased with the results so far.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible but figured \\&quot;what the heck, just give it a shot-not too expensive-what have you got to lose\\&quot; attitude.  Some hair is actually, noticeably, coming back.  We&#x27;ll see just how much regrows over the next few months and what the side effects are but I plan on continuing using the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle, I&#x27;ve been using this instead of my gel.  The only way this product works dramatically is to make sure you apply it generously all over the affected (immediately after a warm long shower in the morning when pores are opened up) and at night before going to bed.  This product works exceptionally well if you stay active (ie, working out to increase circulation/opening pores when sweating to absorb active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure the people who dont see significant results are probably not doing all of the above or their hair is long gone (too late to do anything about it).  Make sure you don&#x27;t use the weaker versions of this product if you want to see significant results (at least that makes a big difference for me).</li>
    <li> As of late last year, I have been noticing my hair seems to be thinning out and receding. I got nervous and quickly tried out a few hair products for a few months but all of them failed until I found this product. I have been using it for half a year now and my hair is even thicker than before, even my receding hairline has grown back. All my buddies noticed the difference even myself! Funny thing is the applied area became more thicker than the non applied area lol! More is better  I can&#x27;t complain. I do now use it only once every few days now that my hair is back to normal. I am 29 years old if that helps.</li>
    <li> This product is not working for boldness. What is actually does it makes you loose more hair and makes you scalp extremely dry and itchy. I am not recommending to this product at all. I have contacted PerfectImage for a possible refund they offered 50% plus my shipping. Completely not satisfied with product or it&#x27;s company. Be aware!!</li>
    <li> WoW im so mad right now. i started using perfect image solution minoxidill like 3 month ago with best resust ever and now that i finally find something that works they are runing out of bussines omg whyyyy whyyyyy.....</li>
    <li> I had high hopes after reading the reviews for this product, but I guess it&#x27;s not for everybody. I was using other products which seemed to stop or slow down the thinning of my hair but after only two weeks of using this product, my hair looked Horrible. I had thinning on the right side of my head and after only two weeks it looked worse and my left side now looks the same. It is extremely greasy and it takes about 45 minutes before it&#x27;s dry. Hopefully not everybody has the same experience as me, I am greatly disappointed.</li>
    <li> Sorry, I have not had this product long enough to review it&#x27;s intended achievements. I am using it as directed. I can probably review this product in another 2-3 months.</li>
    <li> I use the product accordingly ,lost lots hair the first 10 days,nothing happened after that i wish it worked.  thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I got it 6 months ago for my son 19 years old,he almost had no hair left on the top of his head. After 2 months all of his hair came back and even more then he had before! I am shocked how well it works! He is using it 2 times per day. It really works!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband after he was getting humble results from the Rogaine foam.  I did my homework, liked the 15% Minoxidil combined with the Azelaic Acid and the price was comfortable.  This restored a space patch to looking consistent with the rest of his hair.  He uses it twice a day and has had no irritation or side effects, other than needing more haircuts!  It has also made him less vigilant about coloring his silvering hair, because he doesn&#x27;t feel it ages him like the thinning did (in his opinion only.)  He just started on his second bottle, and as long as the price stays reasonable, we might as well have it on auto-delivery!</li>
    <li> I used this products for my eyebrows......it took about 6 months..but they definately grew in  thicker and fuller than they were before. VERY happy with the results............</li>
    <li> OK...I&#x27;m going to be really honest about this product. First of all, if you care that much about this product being slightly on the oily side then maybe you just don&#x27;t care about your hair regrowing bad enough. It&#x27;s slightly oily-- basically making my hair look slightly damp intially and takes about an hour to dry. Not bad at all b/c I have an oily scalp before product application.    I&#x27;ve read people getting headaches from this, but I&#x27;ve personally experienced no side effects. No headaches, no excessive hair shedding, not a thing that would make me put this bottle down. For those of you that have experienced headaches, where in the world are you guys putting this stuff? More importantly, why would you continue using something that gave you headaches?! That&#x27;s just crazy.    Finally RESULTS!!! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for roughly two weeks. The frontal area of my head...Dare I say...actually blends in with the sides and top of my head. The bald spot on my crown is barely noticeable-I was annoying noticeable two weeks ago. I had a haircut after using this stuff for a week and a half o.O. For this stuff being the first hair regrowth product I have used, I&#x27;m really shocked. The results I have gained already makes me slightly angry that I didn&#x27;t use this product when I started losing my hair hair at the age of 20! I&#x27;m finally free of looking 5-7 years my senior! I would give this product 10 freakin&#x27; stars if I could.</li>
    <li> I purchased four bottles of this item, 5%, and 15%. We have several different ages this product was used, 35, 52 and 87, 5% was used on the 87 year old. BOTH products grew hair, not peach fuzz as most over the counter products do. The 52 year old had had three hair transplants, one being a so called mega treatment. The doctor advised the patient to take an oral DHT blocker, but was unable to do so. Over the next year, hair loss continued over the normal hair. He has now been on this product for 3 months, and people have asked has he had an additional transplant. This is REAL hair growth, the shaft of the hair is strong and normal. The 87 year young man is using the 5% and after two weeks, he is experiencing growth. The 35 year old man&#x27;s bald spot in back filled in first, normal hair and was the fastest. This product works. Doctors tell you even with transplants, a DHT blocker is recommended. I would encourage you to try this product, very few things work, but this does.</li>
    <li> As a man who suffers from thinning in his younger days (started age 19), I felt like it was far too early to go with this baldness thing. When I turn 30 I&#x27;ll probably stop making an effort but for right now, I&#x27;m trying this product to see the results. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head recently so I don&#x27;t even have to bear the greasiness that goes with it. Easy to apply in a durable glass container. I received it two days sooner than their lowest estimate. I will return to post more on the results in a month or two.</li>
    <li> have been using this for around a week. it has caused some itching and irritation to the scalp, and may have noticed even thinner hair. I have read that \\&quot;shedding\\&quot; is supposed to happen in order for the product to work. but I&#x27;m not sure if a person who experiences itching + shedding is rather doomed cos that may mean that I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients..     will continue using for a few more weeks to see results. I just don&#x27;t understand how people who have expereinced shedding are brave enough to stick through it! it just seems so terrifying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this for my husband for almost a year now and he loves it!   Before he started using it, he would lose a lot of hair during the day and in the shower and now he is noticing that his hair is much stronger and doesn&#x27;t fall out like before.   Also, he is starting to notice that the crown is filling in a little bit too and even his hairline is a little thicker.    We&#x27;ve tried all the other ones out there including Propecia and found that this is really the only one that works!     Recommend that you apply it before bed as you can&#x27;t really walk around with it in your hair unless you enjoy a slept-in look.</li>
    <li> This product i have concluded is as pretty much like everything else on the market, perhaps a little peach fuzz, perhaps some tiny hairs that you hope might become strong healthy hairs, but nope, the reality is that you will spend alot of money and time and you will still be that bald/balding guy, sorry, believe me I&#x27;m as disappointed as anyone. Ive used this product for about 8-12 months, money wasted. It is amazing that these products all seem to give some sort of result in the first month or so, or maybe its just wishful thinking. I have been using it everyday almost without fail twice a day. spend the money on a gym membership (buff and bald looks good) or a downpayment on hair transplants is my advice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 54 year old male. Typical male pattern; started on crown area around age 30 and developed to about 3\\&quot; diameter over the last 20 years. It&#x27;s quite thin across front to back w/both side part areas gone. I started using this (2 bottles/2 months gone by. I new see hair now growing in the part areas where there was none! Good enough to see on a sunny day looking in the rear view mirror of my car. I will repost this as an update in 2 months or so.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using this for about 6 months, and I have seen results. There has been no noticable side effects. I have noticed some growth of hair in the frontal hair line, as well as the crown of my head. I have tried other other hair regrowth products, and nothing compares. This product comes highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I got persuaded in buying this product but I guess the actual customers are the ones in the 1 and 2 stars. I do see the good reviews of people are just fake as most have reviewed just perfect image&#x27;s product or a single day reviews ever and that too of perfect image. Apart from that it is damn sticky which is not what drives me crazy but the amount of hair I have lost after using it is beyond belief. I know people would say give it time. But, since I have used rogaine for more than  year, I know what shedding is like. Before buying the product do read the comments in 1 and 2 starts to know how badly one looses hair which may not grow back. I would strongly discourage to use the product !</li>
    <li> First couple of weeks nothing to report of then I think this stuff actually accelerated hair loss and started making my hair thin towards the front of my head.  Did not have any growth and would not recommend this overpriced ineffective product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night to the front hairline. First month I saw a lot of shedding. The next 2 months, I was able to see a some tiny hair starting to grow. Very recently (4th month going on) I can see the tiny hair start getting darker and longer. The results can be seen not only in the thinning areas, I can see new hair growth outside of the hairline too.  I&#x27;m very encouraged with the results from the 15% minoxidil solution, I&#x27;ve started using their shampoo too. I can say I&#x27;m confident I can fight hair-loss now! Latest haircut I even went for a longer hair style instead of the usual short one!</li>
    <li> Any minoxidil treatment over 5% is an illegal violation of FDA regulations that mandate that minoxidil for men be no more than 5% (women is 2%). So be aware, this manufacturer is apparently disregarding Federal health and safety regulations.</li>
    <li> yo been receding since age 17..now 24...been using propecia and avodart for last 2 years..in combo with ketoconazole shampoo...no further hair loss since but no regrowth either..i&#x27;m on the first weeks using the minoxidil 15%..will tell u soon if i see results using all 4 products...also started eating a lots more frut, vegetables and nuts and also a potent multivitamin...gotta get back my frontal yo...wanna have that young spiky style again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since july on my crown and my temple area. i&#x27;ve had some light thinning and recession over the past few years, nothing alarming but enough for me to notice and enough for me to be able to reverse and prevent it with the right product. well, this is definitely that product. I can&#x27;t tell you how great it feels to not have to worry about it anymore and feel like i have the same hairline as i did when i was 18. This, in conjunction with Nizoral shampoo and finasteride will keep my hair thick for many years to come.  not only did i see thickening, there has been regrowth in those two areas (crown, temple) and it seems to be a continiuing theme.  the crazy thing is i occasionally miss a dose and still seeing these results.  highly recommend. only thing i wish was that they would make this amazon prime eligible!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used generic minoxidil for some time, but I saw only a minor improvement. Yet after only two weeks with this formulation I see new hairs at the vertex of my head where there were none before. As noted in the instructions, some hair did continue to fall out, but so far results are acceptable. So I&#x27;ll continue with this product for at least three or four months to give it a fair trial. Everyone should take some before/after pictures, just to get a real feel for the changes.    I use the formula twice a day, and it does make your hair feel a little stiff. But after the formula has been on my scalp a couple of hours, I just dampen it and comb or brush it as usual. Actually, it helps keep my hair in place.</li>
    <li> I would not normally spend the time to write a review about a product on amazon but with a condition like hair loss I know there are a lot of people (myself included) who are bothered by it and could benefit from an honest review. Unfortunately, because results are based on so many factors (genectics, age, etc..) it can be extremely difficult to interpret how a product will effect you based upon words on a computer screen. But heres my story and hopefully it will be of benefit to some of you.     I am a 22 year old white male who began noticing my hairloss a year ago and decided to take a heads on approach to fighting it. Although I have somewhat low self esteem and have battled depression for a number of years, I have been told often that I am very, very good looking. In many ways that has made the situation worse, making feel as if people are always looking at me and trying to find things that are wrong with me. It has made me super self conscious, often making it difficult to be around a lot of people. Because of this, when my hairline started to recede slightly(and i mean very slightly) it caused me a great deal of anxiety. after trying a number of products from store brand minox to Nu hair, I finally settled on a regimen that has given me a tremendous amount of hope. Using this product, combined with fin, nioxin, and nizoral shampoo, I have just about perfected my hairline in a little over 4 months. Although very few people will fight hairloss as head on as I did, I can honestly say with a regimen similar to mine you should most definitely see positive results. Although age and degree of hair loss will have an effect on the amount of regrowth you see, if your patient you will most likely be as happy as I am. And the longer you are able to stop hair loss from worsening, the more time it gives scientists to come up with a cure once and for all. I wish all of you the best of luck in reaching your hair loss goals and feel free to comment I would be happy to answeryour questions.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST thing I have ever used for thinning hair!!!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone with thinning hair, it really works and is so much better than the stuff they sell OTC in the drugstores, and mega-marts,</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend as a joke.  He isn&#x27;t bald, but is balding in spots and I always tell him is is old and he hates it!  However, then he used it and it works great! This product is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is really a great product.  I am 28 and began to notice a significant widow&#x27;s peak about a year ago.  Now, minoxidil is not clinically proven to work on the front of the scalp, but there has been some evidence that for some guys it will work.  I have been using minoxidil based products for about a year and I do feel that it has worked, I am beginning to see some areas of growth in my temple area that have not had hair for awhile.    This product also has the DHT inhibitor, which is very important to stop existing hair loss.    This is not a miracle product, no product, except maybe rx propecia, is a miracle worker (and frankly the side effects sound worse than hair loss to me), but it is worth a shot and it&#x27;s a very high quality formulation.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp.    I recently went with a buzz cut to get a feel for how I&#x27;d look clean shaven when my hair loss gets too bad to try and hide, and I can see more clearly now where my widow&#x27;s peak is and what areas are showing some signs of regrowth.  Going with the buzz cut also cuts down on how \\&quot;stiff\\&quot; this product will make your hair.    Overall this is a great hair loss product but just don&#x27;t expect any miracles.  1 star off because it will leave your hair a bit stiff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different products and this one is by far the best. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s now and I&#x27;ve grown back a great deal of hair with this formula to the point where even my barber has noticed it and wants to try it himself. It may not work for everyone but so far its performed outstandingly in my case.</li>
    <li> This is my 6 order and my crown is 70% cover, my wife,son,cousin they say you don&#x27;t need a hair transplant and actually I will star using two formula per month ,one for my crown and one for my front hair line .  Very good product.</li>
    <li> I used to get the same formulation from another supplier at twice the price. It was also much thicker and more difficult to use. If you want to virtually completely block 5-DHT this is for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this product before and it was fine. This last batch was terrible. It&#x27;s greasy and stays wet for hours. When it finally does dry, you can hardly get a comb through your hair.</li>
    <li> As a research scientist, I am not easily impressed. I have been using this product for 6 weeks, and have seen more hair regrowth initiated in this time, than I could have ever have imagined. The best part? It is along my frontal hairline. I am 45 years old, and with this product, I have a renewed excitement about how much hair I may still have when I&#x27;m 55, 65 and beyond. I also plan to start taking Now brand Biotin this week, as I have heard wonderful things about the nourishment it provides for hair growth. I have already ordered two bottles more, and will try and stay at least a couple of months ahead, in my supply of this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Before I turned 20, I began losing my hair. It was on my pillow when I woke up, it was on my towel when I dried myself after a shower, it was on my hands after rubbing my head, it was just about everywhere. Over a year later, I decided I didn&#x27;t want to go bald and thought I&#x27;d attack the problem early on. I tried Rogaine foam off and on along with pills from Provillus and they weren&#x27;t effective. Probably 8 or so months ago (I&#x27;m now 23) I started using Perfect Image 5% Minoxidil, and after a couple months with virtually no improvement, I thought I&#x27;d upgrade to the 15%. So I&#x27;ve been using this along with the shampoo for maybe half a year and I still am losing my hair. It still ends up on my towel and pillow, and there always seems to be 5 to 10 strands on my finger after rubbing the solution into my scalp (I keep my hair buzzed by the way). I&#x27;m wondering a couple things.   For one, is the loss of hair ever supposed to end, or is the product more specifically intended to just grow additional hair? Secondly, if I don&#x27;t apply the solution twice a day religiously will it not work? With a sometimes erratic schedule, there&#x27;s probably 2 or 3 days out of the week where I apply the solution once instead of twice. Third, I try to rinse my hair 30 to 60 minutes after I apply in the morning before going to work in order to get rid of the stickiness. Will this hinder the products effectiveness? I try not to wet the actual scalp when doing this, just the hair. Also, whenever I&#x27;ve bought the shampoo before it has been an orange color, however it is green and not quite as thick in the one I&#x27;m using now. Why? And how often should I use the shampoo? Right now I do probably 4 or 5 times a week.  I&#x27;m not bald anywhere yet but my hair line is receding and the whole top of my head is especially thinning. I&#x27;m gonna try 3 more months of this but any insight would really be appreciated. Thanks.</li>
    <li> At 47 my hair line has slowly been receeding for years. In March of 2011 I noticed I was loosing it in the back too.   Don&#x27;t look at the back of my head very often but when I realized I was losing it back there I decided to take a shot with this product. I originally was going to buy rogaine and found this product by accident. Figured if a little is good a lot is better. I can&#x27;t compare this stuff to other products or strengths. I am happy to report this stuff does work well.   The back is filling in, my hair is thicker and grows much faster. It&#x27;s been a slower road on the front but from what I have read the longer the hair has been gone the longer it takes if at all to come back.   This stuff is sticky. If you brush it in it works for me a lot like a gel. But if you touch it your hands will be sticky, that&#x27;s why I gave four of five stars.      The daily regimen is a pain but the results make it worth it for me.   I also buy their shampoo and like it. The two products seem to work well together.   Hope this helps.....</li>
    <li> I know that Minoxidil 5% was working well for me until i heard about the 15% version.  I have noticed the difference right away -- after only one week of usage, i have already noticed the difference.  Thank you Perfect Solutions.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 months with the same bottle.  Every morning and at night before i go to sleep.  I feel my hair is stronger, thicker and new hair growing out also. I use Nixon shampoo with this product because the Nixon helps to open up the pores and cleans it up, and Minoxidil helps to stimulate the roots of the hair.  Its not greasy and its easy to use.</li>
    <li> thinning and receding hairline is showing new growth...  confirmed new hairs..not \\&quot;perceived\\&quot; like other products..  I will continue to use..no side effects, red scalp at all.  I have also noticed much less lose during shampooing in the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other minoxidil and azelaic acid blends. All of them left my hair with a heavy, sticky residue. This one had the lightest residue. Results are very noticeable. Don&#x27;t waste your time trying the other brands, this is the best option available.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product since early December (10) and all I can say is that it works. My hair has grown back in where it has been thinning. I use it before sleep and have had no side effects. I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I used it for 1 month. Didn&#x27;t find any substantial change. I know that it is too short a time to judge, but considering I&#x27;m currently a college student, 35 bucks a month for minoxidil was just a bit too expensive. Hence, I went to Walmart and picked up the 3 month supply of Equate Minoxidil. That seems to be doing the job so far, and I have no complaints. No hair loss and decent growth to keep me satisfied.    Also, this product makes your hair super dry!!!!</li>
    <li> These products are easy to use. I would recommend using both products. It seemed that regular shampoos made my hair fall out more. Since I&#x27;ve started using these products my hair loss has almost stopped and I am seeing some new grow of hair. I am hoping by continuing to use these product my hair loss will completely stop, and maybe I will regrow some of the hair I have lost.</li>
    <li> This product is very effective. I&#x27;m 20 years old and started to losing hair in the receding hair line. I took action right away and looked for the best product out in the market. Finding this has helped me in a major way.I Prefer this product because it works. It penetrates your scalp with the retina a and has brought most of my hair back. I love it, and it will work for you. Not sure to purchase? give it a try its not like $100.00 especially save u the money for surgery. Try it and get your hair back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 19 years old, almost 20. Ive had thinning hair for a year and a half to 2 years. The whole top of my head has thinned to a point of being able to see through to the scalp a little bit when I&#x27;m in sunlight or bright light. My temples have thinned even worse. It has really affected my image and I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to solve it in every way over at least the past 6 months. Ive tried alot of stuff including herbal remedies, rogaine, spencer forrest laser comb, etc. None of them produced any physical benefits. I did the laser comb religiously for 4 months with no noticeable benefits. I&#x27;ve been on rogaine 5% religiously 2x daily for the month prior to finding &amp; starting this 15% minoxidil. I was concerned the rogaine just wasn&#x27;t going to cut it, especially for my temple &amp; frontal areas. Over the past 2-3 weeks of using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed the back top circular area of my head has thickened and darkened (still not perfect, but its noticeable). Also the top of my head has thickened noticeably. The front middle area, which also had a more thin spot similar to the temple area has also thickened probably by around 50%, and is almost filled in. The temples haven&#x27;t shown any huge improvements yet, but thats probably because they were the most severely affected spots. I&#x27;ve checked them to look for any new hair, and I think one side might have grown a few hairs, nothing major, while the other side hasnt really grown any. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I&#x27;ll continue to order more (ordering the 2nd bottle tomorrow).     Now here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing/taking: my teen years I really did have a crappy diet. I didn&#x27;t know the importance of eating good meals. Now I continue to eat a good diet and take vitamin supplements, because yes I could be putting effective minoxidil on my head, but if you arent eating enough food and minerals to grow hair, how can I expect it to grow back? Every day I take vitamin B-complex (includes biotin), vitamin A,C,E,S (all in 1 capsule), and Biosil (natural silica) because silica is used to make hair. I also take Omega 3 fatty acids. All of these things can be found at The Vitamin Shoppe.     As for the application process, I apply the minoxidil 2 times daily, every single day, no exceptions. I don&#x27;t worry about how much I use, I worry about getting my head &amp; affected areas completely and efficiently covered. Why be cheap with it when you really want it to work ? You&#x27;re working against your efforts by being a cheap applicator. But the amount I use usually ranges from 1.25 to 1.5ml per application. On to the greasiness and side effects: Yeah its greasy for an hour or so, but then it dries up and is as good as a strong hair spray. I don&#x27;t mind the look of having it in my hair, because I have shortish hair, so I just brush it forward and it works out fine. You guys that complain about the greasiness and side effects really need to consider what matters to you more: whining about small side effects, or actually regrowing your hair. If it really does bother you that much, you can just wet your hands and run them through your hair after it dries(not wetting your scalp), this way the hair gets loosened up a little by the water and it becomes easier to brush while the minoxidil is still on your head. Do I get headaches? yes. sometimes(not every time) I get a weak to mild headache, but I don&#x27;t let it get to me. I know that this means its working(but you don&#x27;t need the headache for it to be working). If you really really want to re-grow your hair like I do, you learn to suck it up and deal with the minor things.    I can&#x27;t wait to see how much progress I&#x27;ve made after 2 and 3 months. If I keep improving at this rate, I think by the 4th bottle my hair should be almost completely thick and filled in again. I&#x27;ll write a new review at 2 months or 2 and 1/2 months.    I wish everyone the best of luck. And I thank Perfect Image for making such a great product!     *******UPDATES IN COMMENT SECTION*******</li>
    <li> I asked if anyone else had the \\&quot;sticky problem\\&quot; and it is so I feel better about that.Somone answered my question &amp; said that was normal. Reason I asked is because of this \\&quot;heat wave\\&quot; my mail and this product was in my black mailbox until 5pm. So I thought that might have ruined the product. My hair comes in light in color and some is growing now. I am also using a great shampoo, you can check my other reviews for the name. The combo seems to be working when nothing else did. I WILL PUT UP WITH STICKY TO HAVE MORE HAIR!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps someone...Good luck TO YOU!</li>
    <li> About two months ago, I decided to switch to PIH&#x27;s 15% Minoxidil formula from Rogaine (after +1 year) hoping to see more hair growth. After two weeks, I started to notice increased hair loss as indicated in the product information. At the 8 weeks, the rate of hair shedding hasn&#x27;t been slow down or reverse. My thining hair is visibly worst than two months ago.     Right now, I stopped using this product to monitor the hair loss situation. Whether the new hair is growing in place of the old follicles is to be seen, the fact an increased hair loss has damaged my psyche and mistrust in this product. Do your research and good luck!</li>
    <li> I used the product for 3 weeks and it just didn&#x27;t work at all for me, not only that but it has a horrible tendency to make your hair hard and crusty and dries it out as well. Maybe it&#x27;s because my hair type doesn&#x27;t react to the medicine in there, but I would say it was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I switched to this product 4 months ago, after my friend told me about it, prior I was using 5% solution. And the results are a lot better, considering I was using the other product for over a year. My bald spot on the back of my head is slowly covering up, so is my receding hair line in front. I just wish for a bit faster results, and make the product a bit more affordable. But overall its a great product.</li>
    <li> This product does the trick. It has been 2 months since I started using the product. I apply it only once a day (before going to bed) and that&#x27;s it. I can see solid regrowth on my front line and feel much better!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 60 yrs old and have been using Minoxidil for about 30 yrs. Here recently I was losing more hair and less regrowth. I found Perfect Image 15% minoxidil and in the one month of using it, I have noticed no shedding of hair and have noticed a regrowth threw out my head.  I am very happy with the results and will continue to use Perfect Image 15%. I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use that in months to come my hair will literally grow thicker.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted. Thanks Perfect Image and thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> All I can say is I&#x27;ve had thinning edges forever and my edges have grown back (mostly) in 4 months. Thanks. I will continue to use and tell my family and friends about this product.</li>
    <li> hair is getting stronger and i&#x27;ve started watching results after 3 weeks, will ask for second and third month for sure</li>
    <li> I have mild hair loss on the front of my head. I have been using this product for about six months. Rogaine was preventing hair from falling out. This made hair grow back. I ended up buying the 5% to use in the morning because this stuff is just so sticky. I use it at night. Be careful with it. I have noticed hair growing in weird places.. more on my chest and on the back of my right arm.. I think it is where i wipe my hand after i put it through my hair....Good product</li>
    <li> My hair was thinning around the peaks.  I noticed in a photo taken around 6 months back and knew I needed to do something.  First thought was Rogaine.  So I did a little research and asked around.  Sure, it worked but the results were OK and I wanted something less expensive and STRONGER!  I came across PerfectImage Solutions and the 15% Minoxidil.  After just 2 days of using the product, yes 2 DAYS! My hair stopped falling out completely.  Even alone if that&#x27;s all it did, that was worth it.  Then after continuous use twice a day for a month my hair in the front slower became thicker and thicker.  As time went on my hair went back to how it was as a teen, no joke!  I then started lessoning the dosage and slowly I saw my hair start to deteriorate again.  If your going to start using this, be prepared to use it for life at least once a day.  If you can put up with that, you&#x27;ll get your hair back.</li>
    <li> My husband uses minoxidil with low dose propecia....and hasn&#x27;t lost hair in 11 years....as evidenced by old family movies. This particular formula is not greasy....bonus.</li>
    <li> I had been using Minoxidil 5% for over 5 years now.  My results were that no additional hair was falling out.  Let me tell you!  After trying Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% from perfect Image Solutions,  My hair both looks and feels thicker.  I have actually had compliments.  I strongly recommend this product for anyone who didn&#x27;t get great results from the name brand or generics.  This will be my third order and intend to keep using it in the future.  After so many years of trying, I am finally getting the results I desired.  This is a great product.</li>
    <li> It will take longer thank you think, but it will help. Be diligent about application, deal with the stickiness, and be prepared to wait six months or up to a year for really noticeable results. That&#x27;s the way it is. The longer you wait to start, the longer it will be before you get more hair.</li>
    <li> I realize that Azelaic Acid may help with hair growth and that is why it is included.  But I did not realize until doing research (and after I was having a reaction) that Azelaic Acid has the same protein that gluten does 0 so it is not recommended for people with celiac disease or gluten intolerance.  And I was losing hair faster and my scalp itched horribly . . .</li>
    <li> I have used just about everything out there, and continue to research for things out there all the time. I think that this one is the best. I am not going to argue about the power of minoxidil and Azelaic Acid, there is a lot of research out there that supports their effectiveness and they definitely work. What I like about this particular brand is that it&#x27;s non-oily. most of the other cheaper brands (and some of the more expensive that i tried) have the texture of oil. This one is great, it&#x27;s like alcohol, after few minutes, it&#x27;s all gone and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking oily. It definitely works.!</li>
    <li> I am 25 years old and having been losing hair for about the past year. I tried some natural shampoos but ended up with nothing more than a thin wallet. I tried to avoid all pharma products but had no choice. So i picked up this \\&quot;premium\\&quot; Minoxidil product.   I believe it worked well - as in i did see significant hair growth - but the quality of the hair was different, it was very weak. At the same time every time i used this product, i had significant sebum buildup. Then after about three weeks i figured i was losing more hair, than gaining. I asked a guy in a local store here in NY and he told me this product might be too concentrated for a person like me. Since then i&#x27;ve discontinued its use. I am still contemplating on what to do - the Hair loss market is confusing and most of the folks make boisterous claims while we consumers pay the price. I am contemplating on using Rogaine, but would still prefer a natural alternative. In the meantime i have made some modifications to my diet to stop (added flax seed and coconut oil) and have seen some differences already. Here&#x27;s hoping. If anyone knows of a natural way to deal with this please let me know!  Good luck to everyone!</li>
    <li> I just bought 2 Minoxidil 15%, and I think I am going to continue use it for the rest of my life! There is a huge improvement with my hair. I have been using Minoxidil since April 2010, and so far so good. My hair was very weak and then, and I had a horrible bald spot at the back. But now it is less visible, and I hope Minoxidil brings back my hair one day.   I also use the Perfect Image Solutions shampoo, it is a great combination to use it with the Minoxidil 15%, the hair looks healthier and thicker. But I have to say now a days, I don&#x27;t Minoxidil 15% twice everyday, I usually use it once every two days and sometimes everyday.. But so far so good! I was very close to have a hair transplantation surgery, until one day I did my research and crossed to Minoxidil 15%.   I recommend everyone who lost his/her hair after losing so much weight to use Minoxidil along with its Shampoo. You will be impressed :-)</li>
    <li> This was a great product that is no longer available because our federal government in the form of the FDA closed this and other companies like it down. The FDA has limited the sale of this product in a 5% solution only. It is another case of over regulation by the central government. Maybe if we are able to remove the current socialist regime in Washington in the upcoming election, this product may again become available.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 months and It gave me amazing results that I was not imagine it, It has an affective ingredients especially the 5% Azelaic Acid that is not found in other products.  I said that becuase I tried a lot of solutions from difference companies since 8 years ago, all of them produce 5% Minoxidil, so I decided to leave all products and continue using Perfect Hair Solutions product.  By the way, this solution takes effect after 3 weeks and within these weeks the hair loss will increase, but after that the scalpe and hair become stable and hair loss will stop.  What I want to tell you that do not try to stop using this product because the hair loss will return back to you.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product AT ALL. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if what I experienced was due to the product itself or if the product just isn&#x27;t for me. I personally experienced MORE hair fallout using this product. My hair became VERY coarse and my scalp became irritatingly dry and painful, I tried reducing the amount to a bare minimum and even tried changing how I applied it with no luck. I HIGHLY DISCOURAGE this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months. I only use it at night because its too oily to wear during the day for me. In the mornings I use Rogaine Extra Strength.   About this product, I guess its too early for me to decide wether it works or not, because I guess I have seen minor improvements but nothing conclusive or completely satisfactory. For now I can say that I will keep trying the product for 1 or 2 additional months to really see if its working.</li>
    <li> This product works great if you have not let your hair loss for too long. Regrew quite alot of hair on top</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been only a month and a half using this product, not only did I see it work, everyone&#x27;s telling me that my hair is growing back....I feel great now and love this so far. Even though I don&#x27;t apply this product as much as they ask me to but it&#x27;s still working for me. The only thing is that my scalp turns white when I don&#x27;t wash my hair for more than 24hours after using it. But as the instructions say you have to wash hair very well and dry it before using it. Also one thing I found out is that you need to live a very healthy life when you using any hair growth medication like quitting smoking and others since it can affect your hair growth. I&#x27;ll definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I just a 5% minox (kirkland brand) in the morning and this at night. This Minox is very sticky and somewhat sticks to my pillow when I&#x27;m sleeping, but that&#x27;s to be expected with such a high concentration. This minox is amazing. After only one month I&#x27;m seeing a lot of new growth as well as thickening in other areas, and increased hair growth speed. This is the first minoxidil I&#x27;ve used, and it is great.</li>
    <li> Perfect Image is a great company and treats its customers well. When my package was &#x27;lost&#x27; in shipment they called my local post office to help locate it and were very open about the process. I am happy to do business with them and will continue to use their product for at least 6 months to determine how effective it is for me.     Pros:  -Strongest minodidil formulation available without prescription  -Dropper application is easier to spread on your scalp  -Dries quickly and you can tell where it was applied easily  -Great packaging and bottling from a trustworthy company    Cons:  -Makes my scalp itch (I use tea tree conditioner to combat itchiness)   -Makes my hair very stiff (I only use at night)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it in my beard and I&#x27;ve seen the growth of some new hairs that i didn&#x27;t have before. It is not magical definitely, it takes time but it works. I think based on the 30 dollar price and the fact that it might have given 90-100 more new hairs, so a hair for 30 cents it is quite a good cost.    Also i have to let you know that I&#x27;m 22, so probably my hormones affected this. But still everything has developed at the same time I&#x27; been using this product. It didn&#x27;t cause irritation or burn at all, but after some hours it left me some dandruff, which might the same leftovers of the product falling off.</li>
    <li> This product caused my hair to shed(fall out) a lot. The density of my hair was thick, but it has decrease dramatically. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> i have been using propecia for about three month and i wanted to try minoxidil. after seing all these reviews i decided to give it a try and ordered it about three weeks ago. i have a thin hair close to my middle and  frontal head and a slight thining on my vertex. when i started applying minoxidil on my vertex and close to my middle head, i experienced a lot of shedding all over the place. now im very frustrated and worried ..i know it says initial shedding might occur but three weeks now shedding is increasing. my skull is very visible now... i dont konw if i should keep using it or stop it... im scared if i keep using it i might get compltely bold and if i stop it i might not be able to grow the hairs that i just lost. some answer from the company will be nice</li>
    <li> Very good product better than standard minidixidil the mixture of products works very well . I have used others and they didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
    <li> it was my first time using 15%.it is now doing me no harm as some people afraid and i hope its effect were better than 5% i was using.</li>
    <li> This non oily formula has been working well on me, I have noticed positive changes on my scalp since the 1st month. I stop loosing hair and some hair began to grow</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure at first about using this product because i had been using minoxidil products from another company from the US west coast, but when the company was no longer selling minoxidil products, i decided to give this one a try. It has been a few months since i first started and i noticed MORE little dark hairs than i have had in at least 5 years, and these hairs fell out but have started growing back thicker and stronger during the next regrowth cycle.  My hairline has dropped about 2cm from my receeding temples and i now have the confidence to run my fingers through my hair and let people see my hairline!  Anyway, i will keep using and keep people updated on what is happening.  The only negative thing about the product is that it seems to dry in a sticky way and leave white residue that looks a bit like dandruff when i try to wipe it off!  Not that i mind though, because my hair is growing back! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for six weeks, and now starting to see results.  I presume full effect will take some months.  I only have hair loss on front in triangle on sides, and have applied twice daily there.  In these small areas where there was total hair loss, a few new hairs have started growing (about 20 or so).  I was expecting very fine hair to develop as the first stage of growth over the whole area, but instead the hair that has come-in is full diameter hair as the rest of my hair.  Just need for more to start growing and hopefully that continues over next couple of months.  A curious aspect is that a few of the new hairs are slightly curly, whereas my hair is completely straight.    I&#x27;ve not noticed any of the side-effects mentioned in some reviews, like skin irritation, even though I&#x27;ve used the product in excessive amounts to be sure I tested what might be possible on new growth.  The product does have a consistency that makes the hair very rigid when it dries, but I use a styling product and that resolves it for me (rather than using it only in the evening as some reviewers mentioned).  So far, so good.  ****  This is an update on the above.  Next week will be three months of use of the product.  Good news is that more hair continues to grow in the two front &#x27;corner&#x27; areas that were completely bald!!  In these two triangle shaped areas, the new hair growth has extended to just about the front hairline.  The bald spots have not totally filled-in, but they are no longer shiny bald so it has changed the look.  Now looks like there is &#x27;thinning hair&#x27; rather than &#x27;baldness&#x27; in the treated spots.  The addition of new hairs is gradual, but if this continues at this pace, and I&#x27;m really hoping it does, then it will make a big difference in my hair appearance.  I&#x27;ve also made a couple of minor adjustments in the application of the solution after reading the directions again.  I&#x27;m now being certain the skin is fully dry when applying the solution.  And I&#x27;m emphasizing doing the application twice per day, relatively even spaced in time 12 hours apart. And have also begun using the matching shampoo.    Very happy with this 15% product and so glad I happened on it.  It is very encouraging that something works for hair regrowth and this clearly does!  Will try to do an update in 3 or 4 months for those interested.  Here&#x27;s hoping!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thinning in the crown area and I have noticed visible growth . Granted, I didn&#x27;t completely fill in but it did fill in enough where I feel comfortable. Others noticed as well.  I use it 2x a day.   Pros:  it works   Cons:   bottle didn&#x27;t last a month  takes about 2-3 months to see progress  need to use daily</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! for best results use it with a copper solution to stimulate the best growth. I felt like I was getting very slow results with minoxidil alone. Then I did some research, this stuff is MOST effective with a copper solution to aid in absorption or assimilation in the scalp. After a year of using just 15% minoxidil, I did have very little results, disappointing! I did more research, after 6 months of this and Folligen solution, my hair has started to grow noticeably! I have spent way too much money on my hair (Glory for a woman). Finally I have found the answer. 15% minoxidil is a bit strong for a woman, but I dilute it down with the Folligen, I could not be happier. I may be yanking a \\&quot;fallen eyebrow\\&quot; hair now and then off my face: but my hair has taken to growing again! Look up Folligen Solution, the site recommends always using a copper solution, and if you can tolerate it, also minoxidil. These 2 together are a win/win! The Folligen site has a wealth of info with Dr research! Happy Growing!</li>
    <li> I use this product over a year. And no doubt I can say with certainty that I have completely stopped the dropouts. Although I did not see new growth, but at least no dropouts. And I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I do believe that this product was made carefully by experts to help regrow my hair. It seems to be a good food for my hair. Tiny hair start growing. I have been using it for a month. Within 3 months i believe i can see my hair thicker! This product combined with strong belief is a good recipe.</li>
    <li> I am 43 years old.  I only recently noticed that the hair on the top of my head was getting very thin from front to back.  I began applying this product twice a day, every day, about three months ago.  I am seeing small hairs growing from my head in places where there were no hairs before I started.  Hair is even growing at the front of my head where the instructions claim it is not likely to grow.  I asked my wife to confirm the new growth to make sure it was not my imagination; she saw it also.  This product is easy to apply; it only takes me 3 minutes for a complete, correct application.  There is no mess and no smell.</li>
    <li> I researched several products before ordering.  I found that Perfect Image Solutions Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% has the highest concentration.  I use a couple of drops in the morning and a couple more at night.  The hair is coming back.  The bottle lasts me more than 2 months.  Here&#x27;s the topper (for me at least) I saw the can of 5% foaming Rogain in the discount store, it was $45.00.  So, you can wait, keep shopping, keep losing more hair, OR spend a couple of bucks and see if Perfect Image Solutions Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% works as well for you as it does for me.</li>
    <li> After only about eight weeks of use, I have seen significant regrowth in all areas, from the crown of the scalp to my receding hairline.  I had pretty much given up on regrowing hair at the front of my hairline, but have already seen new sprouts in areas where no hair had grown for over a year or more.  I had tried 5% minoxidil for years, and could never really tell if it was doing anything.  The only downside is that it leaves your scalp a bit sticky.  I crop my hair pretty short, however, so a bit of suntan lotion (which I usually need anyway) helps with that.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend has been using this product for a few months and the results are amazing! A friend told us about it so he decided to try it. I can&#x27;t beleive how quick and sucessful the results were. His hair looks great and he is so much more confident now! If u really want that full head of hair back I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!  My husband has had hair loss issues for the past few years.  He is very sensitive about the subject.  I bought this product a few months ago, and it worked fabulously.  My husband&#x27;s hair growth has given him a new confidence! I am so thankful.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING ROGAINE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS.  I AM 60 YEARS OLD AND LOOK LIKE I AM 40.  I BELIVE IT IS BECAUSE I STILL HAVE RETEAINED MY HAIR , AND HAVE HARDLY ANY GREY EXCEPT A LITTLE AT THE TEMPLES  WITH THIS PRODUCT AND THE ADDED AZELAIC ACID TO INHIBED THE DHT I BELIVE  THAT I NOTICE NEW HAIR COMING IN AND NOT JUST MAINTAINING IT FROM FALLING OUT.  I WILL KEEP USING THIS PRODUCT WITH CONFIDENCE.    NICHOLAS NAS</li>
    <li> I was totally impressed with Perfect Image Minoxidil,  I have been only using product for 1 month but swear I am growing new hair on the top of my head. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep or regrow hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various products from this company and I really liked the free shipping that they offer. This new formula I actually find it more greasy, but I think the absorption rate could be higher. Overall, I do not see drastric results so far, but my hair seems to stop and the hair in partially bold areas is slowly growing up at slow rate. Do not expect miracles though, but I think overall the product delivers what it promises. Also the solution comes with graduated pipette, which was not the case in previous editions of the product. Overall, it is hard to measure how much the product helps with hair regrowth, but it is better than paying for the Rogane products at only 2% minoxidil strength. Try it out and see for yourself. Will write another review in 2 months.</li>
    <li> wellm, i have almost three months using the the 15 solution and the shampoo and i am so surprised, because all people around me tell me, if i made a transplant, and is very noticeable the new hairs i have lost in the last 6 years, and are coming strong, i realle recomend it. i dont understand the poor reviews that some people have written, prove it, consistenly, and you wuill see the good results if you are not tottaly bald.thanks</li>
    <li> Good product, been using now for 10 weeks. I have also been using Alpecin for 12 months. I currently have total cessation of hair loss. Started some small fine regrowth on temples and frontal hairline, but best growth on crown. I only really use it before bed due to the greasiness and it drys hard on the hair, then Alpecin in the mornings. 1 bottle lasts approx 10 wks for me however I&#x27;m using more at the mo as i&#x27;m using it aggresively. Don&#x27;t expect miracles but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve used!</li>
    <li> I started out in the 80&#x27;s when minoxidil 3% was available only through clinical trials. To the extent that it stopped my hair loss, it worked. Growth was moderate at best. A company in California developed 10% then 15% minoxidil and it worked. Growth was dramatic. For all intents and purposes I had a reasonably full head of hair. Growth leveled off and crown and front were a bit sketchy. Decided to give this a try as a last ditch. Wow!!! I realized that I hadn&#x27;t been buying 15% because the difference between this true 15% and their claimed 15% was night and day. Within one month the crown was COMPLETELY filled in and growth in front is dramatic to slightly understate it. Finding something that is exactly what it claims to be is almost shocking given the level of deceit and hype in the realm of hair growth.</li>
    <li> During the 1st month I noticed something was happening.  After 4 months, I can report new regrowth starting in my hairline; it&#x27;s almost unnoticeable; very tinny points...but is there.   I&#x27;m also using perfect solutions shampoo.  Let&#x27;s see what happens after 8 months.</li>
    <li> Hello All. I&#x27;m an adult in my mid-twentys and started experiencing hair loss about two/three years ago. Although I still have a full head of hair, I have noticed receding on the front line, a growing patch on the crown, and thinning on the top. All of this has contributed to my need of finding two things 1)some kind of product that slows down hair loss 2)another product that begins to grow it back. I purchased Regenepure shampoo in hopes of handling the first problem, and I purchased Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% in hopes of handling the second problem.     I&#x27;m a little bit over a month into treating my problem areas and have noticed no positive results yet. I apply on a daily basis, and I make sure to rub in the areas that I can (primarily the forehead and temple areas). Unfortunately, I have seen nothing yet to suggest that this product works effectively, and in fact have experienced several other negatives thus far. The biggest negative suffered is substantial headaches and clouding of the mind caused by using this product. You will absolutely experience this, and I would assume more so depending upon where on the head you are applying it to. I have yet to not experience some kind of headache. This prevents me from using it in the morning (as it is absolutely necessary I keep a clear mind before going to work, as I do work an office job), and it makes it difficult sleeping at night with headaches and a more rapid heartbeat. The other negative I have suffered is a shedding of hair that has essentially doubled since using this product. The instructions that came with the product specifically state that this may in fact occur (which I am glad they are honest about), but it was also supposed to stop occurring within the first two/three weeks of using the product. It does not appear as if this has slowed down in the least bit, and in turn has caused my receding hairline to be more pronounced and obvious as time has progressed.     I will gladly update my review in another month or so as I know hair cycles are long and it takes time in order to see results. However, in regards to those reviews that claim they see results within the first week or two, I cannot possibly believe they are true (for the previous reason listed primarily: that hair cycles take long before being noticed) and in fact question who is actually writing some of these positive reviews. I will admit I was swayed by the overwhelming positive reviews of this product into purchasing it, and I would like to provide an opinion based on my own experience. I have seen nothing but negatives thus far and am concerned not only about the consistent headaches, but also the shedding as well. I also question this product&#x27;s overall usefulness as it appears you will need to suffer at least the first of my two negatives for a long period to come before starting to see results, and also maintaining them as well. For now, I am weary of the positive reviews (is it that unbelievable to think that maybe people who create and market this product are the ones providing positive reviews of it, on one of the most popular consumer product websites in the world?), and rate this product a 2 for my first month in.</li>
    <li> just about to place my second order...had no irritation or negative effects...no detectable hair loss, although too early to tell, seems to be a genuine product..will give an update in two months. Just hoped that the bottle had 120cc instead to last longer between orders.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Premium Minoxidil because my wife had finally mentioned that maybe  I would want to cover up that bright spot on the back of my head.  My father also mentioned that he&#x27;s been using a weaker form of Minoxidil for 20+ years and it has worked fine for his crown.  I searched for the strongest over the counter regrowth treatment I could find and this product also said that it would work on the receding hairlines as well.  It has been 4 months and I have noticed some changes in both areas.  I can&#x27;t give this a five because I need more time to see if it really works for me.  It does look promising though.</li>
    <li> I bought minoxidil over a month ago. I&#x27;ve had problems with frontal areas. After 3 weeks of using i started see results some new hair started to come out, then decided to cut my hair very short just for the summer after that applying minoxidil became much more easier so i dont have to worry about oily hair. After a week i cut it again and now you can really see results a lot of people noticed improvement, i will continue cutting very short for the summer cuz i kond of started to like that look but, after summer i;ll leave it to grow back. i also use nioxin shampoo and conditioner but i didnt see noticeable results but with minoxidil combination looks promising</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product as part of a regiment for about 2 months now and I am seeing major results. I have a huge bald spot on the back of my head that I would never look at. It was a cruel reminder that I was losing my hair and have been for about 20 years.Last night I decided to man up and position my bathroom mirrors to where I can see what results I was getting and I was floored. Not only was I getting fine baby hairs that were noticeable but after I sprayed a copper peptide solution (which is green and it helps sooth the scalp from the harshness that some experience from Minoxidil) I noticed even more fine hairs that were coming out. I would have to predict that when the hairs go through their growing phase (fine hair, dormant, fall out, thicker hair shaft growing in) I can probably predict AT LEAST an 80% coverage in my bald spot if not more. I really wish I would have taken a photo before using this product so I can show you all what the results are like so far. Again, a great product, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Have been using the product for nearly 4 months now.  I am between norwood 2 and 3 stage and have hair like matthew mccounaghey in his ghost of girlfriends past movie. My main concern was my receding hairline and  my hair is thinning in the middle areas and the back (although very mild and not easily noticeable).  My receiding hairline is claarly noticeable.      Loved it in the beginning as it slowed down my hairloss and not as much as hair was falling into my hands in the shower or elsewhere.      After around 2 and a half months my scalp began feeling terribly itchy.  Sent Dave an email he reccomended a normal hairloss shampoo like Pantene.  I didn&#x27;t want to stop using the product because I felt that it had reduced the amoutn of hairs I was losing.     Nearly 4 months now and inspite of the reduction in hairloss, my hair does look thinner especially on the hairline and in the crown aswell.   The frontal right area of my head has gone extremely thin and i do freak out when i look in the mirror.   IT could very well be that my hairs going through the shedding stage in the cycle at the moment and that coudl be the reason why it looks and feels so much thinner.   Still have another 2 months of supply left.     Am willing to give this product atleast 12 months.  In 12 months I should expect to be better of then I was when I started it.  If not then it definitely hasnt worked      Will post anohter update in October.</li>
    <li> I used minoxidil 5% for 1 year now and i saw some result specially in the middle of my head but with this product i saw result in the front of my head which is very difficult and i use it only for two months now........</li>
    <li> I have tried several products over the years and the best I could hope for was a slowdown of my hair loss.  I tried this product and my wife and I noticed some regrowth in just two weeks!  I am amazed at the results.  I have been using this product for about two months and there truly is a visible difference, even from a distance!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It is a product that works! I use it once a day, before bed time; leave it 8 hrs on my hair during the night, and shower it in the morning. If you do that for 3-4 month without skipping days, you will see that the hair start getting thicker. You will still lose some hair, but more will grow. I started this method 3 yrs ago and I can see an improvement.   The bad part is that the new product is greasy and stays wet for hours. Also you need to use about 2 ml to cover the whole scalp (not 1 ml) and the bottle goes empty in a month. You have to buy 12-13 bottles for the full year and the product is not coming cheap.  But overall it is working!! I have tried some other methods that include taking lots of vitamins and it did not work.  So I will use this product at least 5 years from now.</li>
    <li> This thing definitely works wonders. I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now and I can see the difference clearly at my crown. There was this bright blotch right in the middle, but not anymore. It is now fading away... it is not completely gone yet, but it atleast it is much less embarrassing than before, and if this thing continues to work the way it did, then it is definitely on its way. No side effects from 15% minox. PIS 15% Minoxidil rocks!</li>
    <li> First of all, I am not some salesman for any perfect image solutions product..  I am a white male who first noticed signs of hair loss at age 18, I am now 27..  My hairloss is only at my temples from what I can tell (widows peak)..  Within the last year I have tried my hardest to fight my MPB...  I started out using walmart brand minoxidil 4 mo supply, used it until it gone... no results..  Then I used Dr. lee&#x27;s 15% xandrox plus finasteride, I believe I saw results..  I just couldn&#x27;t use it twice a day because of the finasteride....  During the last year I have also used 10% minoxidil from minoxidil max, and 5% minoxidil from dr.lee&#x27;s as well.. I decided to go for the gusto by purchasing a 15% solution that can be used twice a day..  I selected this solution because I read that retinol (vitamin A) helps with the absorption of minoxidil...    I have been using this product for a month and I have been shedding like crazy, but, I think I am only noticing my shedding because I am paying more attention to my hair now (I read that it is normal for any average person to shed around 50 to 100 hairs a day) and if that is true, than damn, that is quite alot..  But I also notice new growth around my temple region, not alot, but a few hairs that are dark (healthy, not peach_fuzz)...    I do have my faults, all of which I know contribute to hair degradation, cigarette smoking and consumption of alcohol...  When I started using PIS minoxidil I also started rolling my own cigarettes, I did this as a way to save money, and plus it helps to pay for my minoxidil.. I went from smoking three quarters of a pack and possibly two packs a day when I am drinking down to a half a pack a day....    When I purchased my first bottle of PIS minoxidil I also bought their shampoo, I had been using nizoral shampoo for the last seven month&#x27;s anyway (wal_mart.. 12 bucks) so I thought I might as well try a brand that is specifically meant to help with hair loss.. (apparently the active ingredient ketoconozole blocks DHT)    So in conclusion.. This is what I use, I will probably continue to use these products even if i do not show significant hair gains as long as I am able to maintain the hair I have..    (warning I have felt the symptoms of increased heart rate, but, this could be from the combination of what I am taking..  not just one product alone)      PIS 15% minox  PIS shampoo  two capsules of saw palmetto (walmart)  GNC mega man vitamins)  GNC NO_XPLODE ( I love energy drinks and this is a cheaper, healthier substitute    I will write a new review when I am done with my second bottle...... Best of luck to all!          (update)    I am starting to see more hairs come up around my temporal region, some of which appear to be darker..  I have scheduled an appt. with a doctor to be prescribed finasteride (propecia) as well.. It will actually be a generic version of proscar, which I will cut up into four 1.25 mg pills..  Bought some spring valley (hair, skin and nail support) vitamins.. The doctor suggested getting a product with a daily dose of 3 mg of biotin..  FYI nioxin only contains 300 micrograms, which is 1/10th what is suggested....  I will only be taking one gnc mega man vitamin a day now that I am taking the other...  Overdosing on minerals can cause adverse effects towards hair growth..</li>
    <li> My hair loss concern is that my temple peak on my left side has become obviously thin when compared to my right side. This has become more apparent over the past 5 or so years. I am a &#x27;black/African American&#x27; male who has visited the same barber for the past 12 years at least once every two weeks and many times once per week. He knows my hair very well and probably better than I.  After using one full bottle of this, I slightly noticed a positive change as my left temples spot/patch became a bit darker however my barber did not mention a change and I never mentioned Minoxidil to him. I went forward and purchased a 2nd bottle and I am now half-way complete with the 2nd when my barber says to me, \\&quot;Hey, I think your hair is growing in this area... what is going on?\\&quot; - lol. Well, I can&#x27;t say if it is the Minoxidil or Biotin + Black Currant Oil tablets that I was taking. I am now complete with two orders of tablets and will strictly use the Minoxidil 15% to determine what the answer was. I also began washing my hair with organic baby shampoo and conditioner in-place of adult scented / chemical filled versions.  If the thinning returns, I will buy the Biotin and Currant Oil and will stop the Minoxidil. If all fails, I will liberate and cut my hair off and go bald :-)    Negatives - I don&#x27;t think a person can apply this during the AM (per the instructions) if you work in a professional environment or around people and cant wear a hat. When it dry&#x27;s, it is very sticky and turns grey! I only apply prior to bed and after I wash my hair. I also do not follow the instructions by applying the recommended dosage as I find it just runs down my forehead. I apply about half the dosage and I massage it into my thin spot.     Good luck,</li>
    <li> I bought this product \\&quot;Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% DHT Inhibitor\\&quot; and the first impression was very good. The product has a interesting packing that is easy to use without waste the product. The impact on the first use was good, without irritation and the hair seems to be natural. I take some pictures on the first day use and my intention is to use it for at least  6months to see the results, comparing the pictures.  In my opinion it can help us to solve the baldness problem.</li>
    <li> Even though I live 100 miles from them it took over 3 weeks to arrive.  Too early to tell (less than one month) if product is working.  However, I can say that it leaves your hair a gooey, sticky mess.  I have been using it at night when I don&#x27;t have to go out; and regular 5% Rogaine in the morning when I go to work.  Takes a really long (hours) time to dry.  Will post follow-up when I hit the 3 month period.  Follow-up:  Just finished bottle number 3.  Wish I could report amazing results, but I can&#x27;t.  This is one of these products that we so desparately want to work.  So much so that we can fool ourselves into thinking it is working better than it really is.  I thought I was seeing some thicker hair but my girlfriend insists its my imagination.  With blonde hair it is very hard to see if there is any tiny growth or not.  Money is not really an issue so I guess I will try another two months.  After 6 full months, twice a day as directed, no noticeable results.  I wanted this product to work real badly; but sadly, would advise you to save the $200+ that I wasted.</li>
    <li> This is the best product in the market so far, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a quite sometime and I can really see some amazing results. The shampoo is perfect. I like it and I&#x27;m going to continue to use it - I&#x27;ve already ordered two more. Thanks Perfect Image work well done.</li>
    <li> I have been using since february.   only half a dropper (0.5) at night before bed.  It appears that I have a small blond fur in areas a have los hair (In temple area).  Need to see if it gets ticker and longer.  Will stick to program until completing the year.  Will let you know how it goes.</li>
    <li> I have tried propecia, nioxin, DIY remedies, kirkland minoxidil, rogaine and rogaine foam. The rogaine being the only item I noticed slowing loss/maintaining hair for me. I am 33 and I started losing my hair when I was 20. I have a large very thin spot on the vertex of my head and thinning temple areas. Since I began use (only 1ml a day I have very short hair), the area of the thin spot on the vertex of my head has shrunk significantly, maybe 1/4\\&quot; in all the way around. And the hair inside the thin spot has begun to thicken and grow with maybe a dozen or more thick and healthy new hairs with lots of fuzz around as well. The areas on the front of my head have begun to thicken which is also very noticeable. This is the end of my 3rd month using the 15% and I am happily ordering more. I am very pleased to finally see something working the way it seems it should. I am not a heavy drinker and am a non smoker and eat well. The one thing I do find to be a bit annoying is that as it dries it&#x27;s quite sticky. I have very short hair so it may dry faster for me than someone with hair 1\\&quot; or longer. If that&#x27;s not a big deal get some for sure. I am as skeptical as they come after 8 years of trying different things. It actually works.</li>
    <li> Great product, great results. I&#x27;ve been using the Minox 15% + Azeleic acid for about six months. I was beginning to see regrowth from when I swapped over from Xandrox, and the regrowth has definitely continued nicely. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff actually works!, I put in on every night and wash off in morning. I have been bald for over 20 years  And it grows dark hair anywhere you put it! Granted they are quite small but they grow longer as time goes on.  Amazing that it grows hairline! They used to say minoxidil only works on crown but not   with this stuff,  amazing!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past 2 - 3 months and I can only say that it&#x27;s truly amazing. I am of African descent and have been experiencing a receding hairline and thinning hair since around age 20. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s now. I have tried other topical treatments as well as pills, none of which have ever worked. I had given up and thought that there was no solution out there and even considered hair transplant.   To date I have been able to regrow approximately 1 inch of my hairline, even in places that had gone completely bald. I apply the product twice per day, in the morning and at night before I go to bed. I realize as well that the new growth is quite soft and manageable. My hair still continues to grow an thicken.   I highly recommend this product to anyone that that is experiencing hair loss, it actually works, I am a living testimony of that. Great product, you can trust this seller, get yours today and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (the 15% version) for three months now. I have seen a noticable difference in hair regrowth on the back and top of my scalp, much more so than the results I have experienced with using Rogain Foam. I still use the Rogaine Foam in the mornings because I like the styling it provides. I use Perfect Image&#x27;s regrowth treatment consistently in the evenings (I&#x27;m using their shampoo now as well). If I used it twice a day I can only  imagine my results would be even better, but like I said I pefer the styling I get with the foam. I find it&#x27;s best applied several hours before you go to bed in the evening to ensure it has time to abosrb into the scalp.</li>
    <li> it ha stopped my hair loss but cant see any hair growing after a 6 month usage period. didnt expect it to work wonders anyway</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m waitting grow up for my hair.  I&#x27;m waitting grow up for my hair.  I&#x27;m waitting grow up for my hair.</li>
    <li> he used it every day exactly the times it said and no it doesn&#x27;t work !!  he definitive won&#x27;t recomend it to any one who needs hair grow !!</li>
    <li> This product help my hair grow back in the spots that were missing! I dont know why they stopped making it, I cant find it anywhere. If you guys get this message, bring it back. Men&#x27;s Premium Minoxidil 15% &amp; Azelaic Acid 5% DHT worked perfectly. Bring it back and I will buy more, im sure others will too. Please!!!!!</li>
    <li> Turns your hair (where you apply it) into a sticky, unmanageable mess.  I had to cut my hair shorter to avoid looking silly.  If you&#x27;re into crunchy, extreme-hold pom aide then you probably will be happy with it.  Oh well, guess it&#x27;s a price to pay for reversing thinning hair.  Time will tell if it actually works for me.  Ingredients seem good and in higher quantities than other products, so I don&#x27;t see why it shouldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Started using it 2x a day for the last month and am seeing results right away. Im 26 years old. Definitely buying more. Only Con is the irritation I feel sometimes, probably because I use 1ML twice a day.</li>
    <li> I used the 15% minoxidil from Perfect Image Solutions for a long time, even back to the days when they had the blue bottles.  I can honestly say that I received much better results than from 5% minoxidil. The major complaint I have is that this product is sticky after it is dry, making it difficult to comb my hair. I switched to other brands for several months to see if the other brands are less sticky and try to save money as well.  I came back to try perfect image 15% minoxidil hoping that they have addressed the stickiness issue after changing its formulation. I have used this new formulation for two weeks, and have found that they are more or less the same as before and consistent with other brands. One thing that did change was the color of this product; it was a lot more yellow than before due to the addition of retinol.  As a long time 15% minoxidil user, here is my impression on this product: even though 15% minoxidil is not the mainstay treatment for hair loss, it definitely worth a try for people who failed to maintain/regrow hair with regular 5% minoxidil. The chance you will get some improvement is pretty decent if you have male pattern baldness. People who want to try this product definitely need to pay attention to the possible side effects such as dropping blood pressure to too low level to cause faintness and dizziness.  A lot of people say minoxidil can only treat vertex/crown hair loss, which is not true. The label on Rogaine says so is because people who were selected to use Rogaine during its clinical trial had crown hair loss. A lot of people with frontal hair loss do get very good results even with 5% minoxidil. Thus it is also incorrect to say that only 15% minoxidil works for frontal hair loss.  Azelaic acid is a putative DHT blocker. It was demonstrated only in vitro experiment; no clinical study to really show how well it works. My feeling is that it is less effective than finasteride as a DHT blocker. So I don&#x27;t think it is wise to give upyour Propecia if you use this product unless you have serious side effect from Propecia.  I like the idea of adding retinol to this product as many physicians have reported that retinol enhances the efficacy of minoxidil significantly. A lot of people confused retinol with retinoic acid. Retinoic acid, namely Retin-A, is a prescription drug, whereas retinol is not. However, retinol works as effectively as retinoic acid because it is converted to retinoic acid in the human cells.  Overall, I like this 15% minoxidil product because it does deliver much better results than 5% minoxidil. I recommend anyone use it for at least 4 months before judging it. I hope the company will make the product less sticky, and then I will change the review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I rated the vendor for good service but the product is terrible.  I tried it and my scalp got irritated and inflamed.  My scalp also itched like crazy so it wouldn&#x27;t have been wise to scratch an imflammed scalp so I was patting my head like a mad man all day.  I ended up losing more hair when I used this because of the side effects.  I noticed someone reviewed it stating that there is a reason that 5% minoxidil is more than enough.  15 percent is way too much and I found out the hard way.  :-(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair loss items, this product is the only item that actually makes the hair grow back.  A few notes for new users:  1) When in the scalp your hair will appear oily and thinner, only in appearance.  To combat this I wake for a few minutes at 0300 every morning, apply the solution half asleep, go back to sleep, wake at 0600 and wash my hair.  The product instructions advise the hair can be washed 1 hour after use, you&#x27;ll need to do this.  2) Never miss a treatment or your hair will begin falling back out.  You must treat your scalp twice a day every day without fail.  3) You&#x27;ll begin to see hair falling out, this is good and means it&#x27;s working.  Don&#x27;t stop using it, think of all the hair your girl leaves in the bathroom.  It takes a very long time to re-grown your scalp.  4) Use between .75 and 1 ml until the hair is re-grown.  5) Minoxidil is a blood pressure drug.  Good luck!  You cannot see that I am balding, 6 months ago you could.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over two months and my hair is coming back. I was desperate, the thinning hair was clearly showing, any breeze was enough to make me panic! There are very few problems that affect a woman as much as hair loss, and buying this product was my last attempt before shaving my head and wearing a wig for good. Now, after years of shame, wasteful and expensive treatments, even a hair transplant, I found a product that is helping me. My head is full of new hair growing and even my temples have an unwelcoming hair growth due to my unnecessary massage in the area. However, I dont care, I know it will go away as I restrain my enthusiasm and do not use the product very close to the area. It is a relief to comb my hair and see it is not all over the floor. I will be travelling abroad soon and will bring along bottles of this product to my brothers.</li>
    <li> Great company and a great product. It was shipped on time as far as the product give it couple more weeks and will see so far so good.</li>
    <li> Its a crying shame they took this off the market, who really knows the reason behind it fully but this was the only product that almost restored my hair fully, i was never happier with a product and i have tried them all, nothing with rogaine foam stuff sucks i do think companies like them come on these and read reviews, which also helps lead to these companies being shut down. But like i said it worked the stuff was sticky it smelt bad but it works for everywhere on your head.</li>
