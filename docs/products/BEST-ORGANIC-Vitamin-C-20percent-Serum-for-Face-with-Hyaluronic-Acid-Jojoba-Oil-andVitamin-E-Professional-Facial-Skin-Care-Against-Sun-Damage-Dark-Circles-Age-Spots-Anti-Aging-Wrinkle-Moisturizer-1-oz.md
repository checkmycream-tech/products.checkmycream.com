<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In just one application of your product has made a difference to my skin. I am 62 years and had given up on having gorgeous young looking skin. But your product has helped me look younger, and I now use less makeup. Thank you for this great product.</li>
    <li> Good vitamin C serum.</li>
    <li> Seems to be just the thing for the skin of 67 year old.</li>
    <li> This product is great! I try to use it every night and have no pain or irritation . I&#x27;ve noticed healthier more supple skin in just two weeks!</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing serum that restores and heals dry damaged skin. My face looks rejuvenated and the most important part- all natural organic ingredients. Definitely a must for women of all ages.</li>
    <li> Many people probably don&#x27;t even know what an anti-aging serum is. They probably just spray on a toner and use some sort of  moisturizer and call it a day. This was similar to what I was doing, minus the toner, until I started trying out a few anti-aging serum products this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many different serum brands out there, in which one these happens to be Skinology 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum with Hyaluronic Acid, Amino Complex, Vitamin E and Ferulic Acid. This unique blend is meant to help fight premature aging (wrinkles, fine lines and age spots) and restore the skin&#x27;s moisture levels. The serum is made with all-natural ingredients that has been FDA Approved and GMP Certified Facility. It is free of alcohol and parbens. Plus, the serum was never been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have enjoyed reviewing this product for Skinology Beauty Solutions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this serum for a few days, but that is long enough for me to know that I already love this product, mostly due to the fact that it has 98% natural ingredients and 72% is organic. I also like that it has many antioxidant properties, which is great for your skin. Overall, I do like the Skinology 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum and I recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.eview. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I am pretty happy with this serum.  It definitely helps my skin to feel more soft and smooth and also helps to maintain the results from other serums I have used in the past that are similar, but contain 25% Vitamin C.  I think this is great to maintain results, but I feel like the results are a bit slower from this serum by Skinology Beauty Solutions.  I can tell the difference between this and the ones with a higher level of Vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would very much recommend this for those who only need to begin some anti-aging regimen.  I am 40 and I need a bit more of an agressive treatment.  It does help with shrinking enlarged pores and refining dark spots and scars on my skin.  I apply this to my face twice a day, morning and night, after I wash my face, and before my day and night cream.  I think this is perfect for women in their mid-twenties to thirties, but I feel like I need something a little stronger.  I am glad I was able to try this at no cost, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t deliver very greasy</li>
    <li> Works good . I have not really seen a difference because I have been only using it for a few days . but the smell is not bad and it does not leave face super oily . I will write an update once I use it longer - this was a sample i got threw karma reviews</li>
    <li> With aging comes wrinkles and other not so wonderful issues with your skin. Some things you just have to accept but dry skin is not one of those things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being of a certain age, I have noticed that my skin is not as young as it used to be. I was sent a bottle of Skinology Vitamin C Serum recently and although I don&#x27;t look like a twenty something mom again; I am beginning to see small improvements in fine wrinkles and more improvement in the feel and softness of my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the product description, this product is made with all natural ingredients in a FDA Approved and GMP Certified Facility. It is formulated without alcohol, parabens, sulfates and never tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C Serum is the perfect solution for all skin types anti-aging and skin restoring needs. All natural ingredients work magic to boost collagen production, eliminate free radicals and minimize the appearance of wrinkles, age spots, acne and fine lines. The serum applied to the face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; areas quickly absorbs into the skin and fights the signs of premature aging and skin discoloration by restoring and hydrating the skin cells, which makes your skin nourished, vibrant and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage: The Vitamin C Serum works best if applied twice a day to your face and neck areas. Gently massage it with your fingers into the skin until fully absorbed for the perfect results. It fights premature aging by neutralizing free radicals, helps replenish the skin moisture levels and leaves your skin with a glamorous healthy radiant look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this based on the quick results I have noticed. I will be using it for a couple of months before I give it a thumbs up or down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was purchased with a promotional code or discount.</li>
    <li> I have been using the under eye and skin care serum for a little over a week now. It has great moisturizing properties for my skin. It is one of the few products I can use under my skin that doesn&#x27;t cause burning or irritation, which  is great! I love that it is made from organic ingredients and not harsh chemicals.  It is pretty thin which allows it to be put on easily and smoothly. I  love the smell.. a citrus smell.  received this product for an honest and unbiased opinion</li>
    <li> The good thing is that this Vitamin C serum is unscented. I don&#x27;t like the ones that have that orange-ish smell to it. This one does not cake up on your face either. It almost feels like you have nothing on, which is comparable to the other good serums on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
    <li> I used the bottle and I am ordering another.  I am 31 and had a &amp;#34;laugh line&amp;#34;  it really bothered me and now I very rarely notice it.  Hoping it will do more for my forehead.  But, also when I started using this product I added a toner and coconut oil to my morning ritual.</li>
    <li> This one was too drying for me, unfortunately. For about the first five minutes I thought it would work since it went on so smoothly and reminded me of my plain old hyaluronic acid serum.....nope! The ingredients are great, but just not for my skin. After a couple days of trying to wear under makeup, I gave up because I started to have the appearance of ...gasp! Crows Feet! Have not had that happen in a long time. Too drying for this girl.</li>
    <li> pretty good, hoped for better.</li>
    <li> I love anything I can do for myself.  I am on a very tight budget.  Day spas and professional facials are not an option for me.  I received this at a great price.  This goes smooth and rubs in without leaving your skin feeling oily.  This is only my experience from.a few days use.  I honestly want to keep using it for a few more weeks to see how awesome the results are then.  The moisturizing effect alone is great.  You can sleep in it  without the scent being over whelming.  It&#x27;s a two thumbs up from me.</li>
    <li> I love it. Makes my skin look youthful.</li>
    <li> I was offered a complimentary bottle of Skinology&#x27;s 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Serum in exchange I would test the product and post my honest opinion here is this review. It actually works really well. What makes this Serum stand out over some others I&#x27;ve tried is the fact that it has ferulic acid in it. Ferulic acid is well known as a topical anti-oxidant that can protect the skin from the damaging rays of the sun. When you combine Vitamins C and E with ferulic acid, you  double their photo protective capacity on the skin. This is simply a must for me since I have fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains hyaluronic acid which is a naturally-occurring polysaccharide found in the human body and acts as a cushioning and lubrication agent for our joints, nerves, hair, skin and eyes. In a nutshell, it is superb hydration for your skin. Hyaluronic acid molecules&#x27; unique ability to attract and retain more than 1,000 times their weight in water makes it one incredible moisturizer for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also contains an amino complex which stimulates our skin to produce more collagen and elastin and protects skin cells from harmful substances by surrounding them with a film of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this serum, that came in an amber bottle with an eye dropper so I can apply it directly to my skin easily. What I wasn&#x27;t very fond of was the scent. Granted it was very faint, but since I am a life long allergy sufferer and it just didn&#x27;t agree with me. I don&#x27;t mean to imply that it smells terrible or anything, it just wasn&#x27;t appealing to me. Other than that, I thought this was one of the better Vitamin C serums I have used. This is what I will be wearing on days that I know I will be in the sun a lot.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this serum.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky or greasy. This serum is  fragrance free which is important to me. I suffer from migraines that are sometimes triggered by different fragrances.  With this serum it is just is naturally fragrance free.  I love that it comes in an amber glass bottle.  It should also last a  while.  I received a sample of this serum to test and review.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. Makes my skin look and feel so soft. I will definitely purchase it again. Definitely helps with the puffy under eye area! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week &amp; I already see a slight difference. My skin looks brighter and healthier. I have severely dry skin, even in the summer, and this feels very hydrating and makes my face feel smooth. I use it every other night before bed after washing my face and toning. I mix in 4-5 drops with my moisturizer and apply to my face in circular motions. I am hopeful this serum will help my wrinkles with continued use.</li>
    <li> Last year at Halloween, I was doing my mothers makeup. As I stared at us both in the mirror I suddenly realized I HAVE MY MOTHERS NECK! I heard about all the celebrities getting younger by using Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night ever since with dramatic results. My rooster neck has tightened up and the lines are hardly noticeable. I&#x27;ve tried several different varieties. This one somehow does not dry me out. I&#x27;m a big fan of the eye dropper. It makes it easier to rub on your chest. You can&#x27;t forget to massage it into your chest. No, I&#x27;m not talking about your boobs.. lol. You should start at your chest and spread upwards for the best results. Don&#x27;t forget to follow with a quality moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s important to note, that you can&#x27;t expect results in a few weeks, it takes months. I&#x27;m on 9 months with Vitamin C Serum and little by little my rooster neck went away. Now my mothers been using it for the last 5 months or so and I can see the difference but it&#x27;s better to get started before your face starts falling. No time like now to get started. The results will shock you if you have the patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided to try and test as a consumer for review purposes.</li>
    <li> I have been concentrating on my skin care regimen lately, as I am getting up in years, I want to make sure to keep my skin looking young and healthy.  One of the best ways I have found is to use Vitamin C serum. I love that this is an organic serum, so I know I am only helping my skin, not putting unwanted chemicals into my skin.  I use this every morning and every night followed by moisturizer and have found that my skin is soft and young looking. This is a great addition to anyones skin care regimen. I am trying to find some really great skincare products to include in my daily skin care regimen, and I do not like purchasing full size products in the event that they will not meet my expectations. PureLx is great for that reason. I am able to purchase smaller products so that I can try them out before getting the full size. So I opted to get the smaller size so that I could try it</li>
    <li> It has good consistency. Not too runny for a dropper. Hate the smell or lack of smell. Not sure if it works yet, too early too rate. You will need a moisturizer afterwards b/c it leaves my face a little tight after application. I am all for safety in products so I will order again. Maybe next time, I will get hyaluronic acid separate. It is cool that they try to bundle it all up together but I wonder if VITAMIN C is negating the hydrating factor of the HA.</li>
    <li> helping reduce age spots and soften wrinkles</li>
    <li> I used this serum for my dry spots on the skin of my face.  I  do not have problem with aging or crows feet.  I do have a big problem with extremely dry damaged skin around my nose and forehead scars I have from a car wreck.  My problem skin looks so great now. I can use this without getting breakouts from it being greasy or oily. I only use it at night. I have dandruff in my eyebrows.  Yes I said it.  I have some weird  scalp thing that gives me very bad buildup on the scars in my scalp from my car wreck.  It is also in my eyebrows so I call it eyebrow dandruff.  nothing works on it but  argon oil or tea tree oil.  This seems to work great on my eyebrows.  It think the product is very versatile.  It only takes me a drop or two to treat my skin.  So it will last forever.  I think that everyone with facial issues should give this a try. I really like it.  I received a discount on this product for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I took a chance in trying this product because I have very sensitive skin, but I needed a boost and I am so glad I did!!!!!  It feels wonderful going on and gives a great glow :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate - buy it - the price is wonderful as is the product!!!!</li>
    <li> I recieved this Vitamin C serum for the face by Skinology Beauty Solutions and its really nice. This is clinical strength serum that is really good for the skin. It has hyaluronic acid in it that tightens the skin, especially around the eyes. This is a not only an antiaging serum, but it moisturizes the skin. There are key ingredients in this product that are used to boost collagen production which helps makes your face look smoother and healthier, but more importantanly younger. It also helps to lighten dark spots, clears up acne, lightens acne scars, and it also helps fill in fine lines and wrinkles which in turn makes you look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum feels cool and refreshing when applied to the skin. It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave any residual feeling of wetness or stickiness. The skin feels soft immediately and stays feeling soft for hours. I love that it makes my skin look so radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is made in the USA and is backed with a complete money back guarantee. No questions are asked. :)</li>
    <li> As a late 20&#x27;s gal, I bought this product to be a bit preventative of future wrinkles and lines and such.  I really like the texture.  It is almost watery.  It goes on very smooth and lightweight.  It feels like is nothing on, which is a good for a first layer when you&#x27;re also adding a moisturiser and makeup on top of it.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong or fake smell, which I liked. The included dropper made it super simple to get out and apply.  I am pleased to have received this product as a discounted price. My experience has been very positive and I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff it smells nice goes on easy and after about a month noticeable difference; she&#x27;s got me using it now also and after two weeks seeing some results.  If your 30+ you owe it to yourself to try it maybe it will be ideal for you... I&#x27;ve already reordered.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I was a little skeptical to say the least.  This is definitely the best Vitamin C Serum I&#x27;ve tried for my face. It has  20% Vitamin C , Acid, Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the ingredients.  I love that it gives  moisture to my face with only natural ingredients - organic Aloe, Jojoba Oil and a special amino blend. It&#x27;s a professional anti wrinkle skin care for my face.  I&#x27;ve seen improvement is sun damage, and fullness in my face,  I&#x27;ve also noticed an marked improvement in the dark circles under my eyes, those fine lines at the corners.  I highly recommend it!  Try it!  I think you will love it too!</li>
    <li> I expected a serum but it was too watery to be a serum. I do not feel it is the most potent vitamin c product I have used. I will go back to my more expensive vitamin c product after I finish the bottle. I thought I could pay less and get the same results, that did not happen.</li>
    <li> I have a friend who uses a formula with hyaluronic acid and swears by this ingredient.  I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to try this product, which contains HA, at a reduced price for the purposes of an unbiased evaluation and review so I decided to give it a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is a liquid, not thick, but I like it anyway.  It seems like I’ve reached the age where my face, hands, and skin in general can use all the help it can get (even though I have been moisturizing for at least the last 10 years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love that this product is not tested on animals nor does it contain any of the nasty chemical ingredients found in far too many products.  My skin is very sensitive and this does not irritate it at all.  I&#x27;m also scent sensitive, so am pleased this serum is neutral, so I won&#x27;t have any problems it in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also great that there’s a money-back guarantee, however, I won’t be taking advantage of that.  This one is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I just started using this Vitamin C serum from Skinology Beauty Solutions 3 days ago and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with it!!!! It absorbs quickly and makes my skin very soft in touch. I already see that my skin became more radiant and glowing after this amazing product. Definitely recommend it to everybody with damaged or dry skin for the best results!!!! Will be back for more!!!!</li>
    <li> What an amazing experience! I purchased this product and received it within a few days. The bottle of the serum itself is very convenient - it comes with a dropper and a cap so I can take it with me anywhere without spilling it. Once I started using the Skinology Beauty Solutions Vitamin C Serum I already can see the difference in my skin - my face and neck became softer to the touch and it looks younger and glowing. In addition to 20% professional strength Vitamin C , I  like the fact that this serum is full of natural organic ingredients so necessary for our damaged stressed skin. I am very happy with this product and definitely recommend it to everybody.Thank you</li>

Once I started using this Vitamin C serum I can say that my face and neck became moist and soft to the touch, as well as healthier and radiant- looking!

    <li> So many things to say about this great little product. First off its packaged in a nice little glass bottle and a bonus it has a little dropper so you never have to worry about spills. This oil is meant for aging and sun damaged skin , Which will come in handy this summer since i do plan on being in the sun and i do tend to burn easily which leaves me with those sad brown spots. This oil is perfect for just that! It also works on fine lines and wrinkles and feels amazing on the skin, Best part this product is not tested on aniimals. So this little oil can,&lt;br /&gt;1. Lighten age and sun spots&lt;br /&gt;2. Fill fine lines and wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;3. Smooth and brighten your skin.&lt;br /&gt; I highly recommend this product.</li>

    <li> I needed something to help my skin have a nice glow and smooth feel. Since winter my face has been so dry and rough looking. This was a nice quality product sent in nice packaging! It is an oil but does sink into the skin unlink some serums.</li>
    <li> This is good and make my face look smooth with bright.</li>

I have been using it for 3 weeks and can definitely feel the improvement. Very powerful ingredients of this serum is all that our aging skin needs and I recommend using this product for all ladies after 35, it will prevent your skin from aging.</li>

    <li> I have been using this for a couple days now and love the feeling of my skin. It feels soft and firmer.....If only I could get it gallon size to firm up everything else :) It has a nice light scent, pleasant not overwhelming. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, just use the dropper provided and gently rub on the face.  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.

    <li> Love the way my skin soaks it up.</li>
    <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;  Since I am no longer in my 20s my skin isn&#x27;t what is used to be. I am now expanding my skin care regiment in order to be kinder to my skin than I was in my 20s. Vitamin C Serum is currently the big thing that I see everywhere since Vitamin C is supposed to be so good for your skin due to boost collagen production and help with reducing the aging process of wrinkles,age spots, and fine lines. It is even supposed to help with adult acne and redness which I have suddenly seemed to inherit out of nowhere. The serum arrived quickly and is in a amber colored glass vial with a eye dropper to make it easier for you to use the serum. The serum itself is slightly opaque with a watery like consistency. It has a faint smell, it isn&#x27;t unpleasant nor is it flowery but there is a slight scent there that I can&#x27;t place my finger on what it smells like. However the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and is disappears quickly after applying the serum. After washing my face and then applying toner,  I use the dropper and place a couple of drops in my hand and then apply the serum to my face and neck and whatever I have left I apply on the back of my hands. The serum dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky or greasy film after it dries so it was easy to apply moisturizer afterwards. I have noticed that skin on my face and neck feel tighter and more hydrated especially since I don&#x27;t need to use as much moisturizer as I used to before using this serum. As an added bonus my skin isn&#x27;t as red as it was before and my adult acne is almost non existent! I am very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> With aging comes wrinkles and other not so wonderful issues with your skin. Being of a certain age, I have noticed that my skin is not as young as it used to be. any people probably don&#x27;t even know what an anti-aging serum is. According to the product description, this product is made with all natural ingredients in a FDA Approved and GMP Certified Facility. It is formulated without alcohol, parabens, sulfates and never tested on animals.This Vitamin C Serum is the perfect solution for all skin types anti-aging and skin restoring needs. All natural ingredients work magic to boost collagen production, eliminate free radicals and minimize the appearance of wrinkles, age spots, acne and fine lines. The serum applied to the face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; areas quickly absorbs into the skin and fights the signs of premature aging and skin discoloration by restoring and hydrating the skin cells, which makes your skin nourished, vibrant and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this based on the quick results I have noticed. I will be using it for a couple of months before I give it a thumbs up or down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was purchased with a promotional code or discount for my unbiased reviews.</li>
