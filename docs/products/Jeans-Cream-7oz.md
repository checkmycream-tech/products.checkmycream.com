<li> Far too much cream left in tube when you can get no more out.</li>
<li> The treatment is working, but he has sensitive facial skin and discomfort due to the radiation.  </li>
<li> I found that the price was a little high for just 7 oz.</li>
<li> just thought I&#x27;d add that because everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but other than being slightly tanned on the radiated area I&#x27;m having no other issues!</li>
<li> On the expensive side, but worth it!</li>
<li> We had many creams from Doctors and VERY expensive prescriptions</li>
<li> You end up with a half sized looking tube that you can pull apart and get at the vast remaining cream until everything is used up.</li>
<li> It does not stain clothes like other creams she tried.  </li>
<li> It really helped soothe the angry burn that began pealing.</li>
<li> Answer is to cut the tube in half, figure out cream from the sealed end into the spout end.</li>
<li> My mom, per the other patient&#x27;s suggestion, applies it in the morning after a shower (or after a pat of a wet washcloth), immediately after radiation treatment (hers was around lunch time), late afternoon, and then again before bedtime - that&#x27;s four times.</li>
<li> This lotion is far less expensive than what I used to pay at the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
<li> and it arrived in a few days</li>
<li> My husband was going through chemo and radiation treatment for throat and neck cancer and his skin was all raw and burnt from the radiation.  </li>
<li> Bought this product for my mom (late 70s)</li>
<li> Also didn&#x27;t leave a thick film on me.</li>
<li> It was really thick and hurt to put on my burned skin.</li>
<li> It was nearly impossible to find locally, so I headed to Amazon.  </li>
<li> She had the same treatment 27 years ago and burned quite badly.  </li>
<li> and it is UNCOMFORTABLE .  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product is amazing . I use it for sunburns and skin care .  My mother Introduced this to me because of her radiation treatments.  I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This was very helpful after radiation therapy. It really heals your skin.</li>
    <li> Jeans Cream is wonderful and does its job. It&#x27;s not greasy and has no perfume added. It calms/soothes irritated skin and is worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> This is very healing cream.  I purchased it for a patient who had undergone daily chemotherapy for a month.  It was very soothing and helped her dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great for radiation therapy</li>
    <li> Great for Radiation theropy . Problem is the package. Far too much cream left in tube when you can get no more out. Answer is to cut the tube in half, figure out cream from the sealed end into the spout end. crunch the spout open end and slide the sealed end over it. You end up with a half sized looking tube that you can pull apart and get at the vast remaining cream until everything is used up.</li>
    <li> I used this cream during breast radiation.  It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
    <li> I found that the price was a little high for just 7 oz. however I feel that this is the&lt;br /&gt;best cream there is for persons getting radiation therapy.  I would highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband has TRIED MANY different creams for his neck after Radiation.  This, by far, has made him the MOST comfortable.  He was left with MAJOR scaring  from Radiation burns and it is UNCOMFORTABLE .  We had many creams from Doctors and VERY expensive prescriptions THAT he DID NOT LIKE AT ALL.</li>
    <li> This cream is an excellent treatment for cancer-related skin problems. Ordered for my cousin in Europe and she asked for another tube, she says &#x27;it&#x27;s a life saver!&amp;#34; She found it to be the only treatment that helps her healing. Thanks a million, Jean&#x27;s Cream!</li>
    <li> I used this after each of 30 breast radiation treatments, and the staff said my skin looked the best of any of their patients.  It really does reduce redness and burning.  Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best cream I have used for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on daily treatment #33 and haven&#x27;t burned.  I apply 3 hours before and right after treatment.  Works well!</li>
    <li> This cream was developed by a breast cancer survivor who needed a cream with no metallic products in it and that would protect her skin from being burned by the radiation treatment.  I am now half way through my radiation treatments and my skin is in great condition.  No burning and only a tiny bit f discoloration.  Very good product.</li>
    <li> My Dad (97 yrs old) is having radiation to his mouth for oral cancer.  The treatment is working, but he has sensitive facial skin and discomfort due to the radiation.  The doctor gave him a lotion to use, but it was very greasy, so he didn&#x27;t want to use it. Then he gave him a couple of sample tubes of this product.  He absolutely loved it and it worked!  It was nearly impossible to find locally, so I headed to Amazon.  My Dad is a very frugal person and I thought he would choke at the price, so I told him it was a present.  He really wanted to know the price, so I told him.  He didn&#x27;t bat an eye at the cost and said it was very reasonable.  You have no idea how good this product is for someone as careful with his penneys as my Dad is to not even give the cost a second thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the large size after reading reviews.  I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t regret it as it will get used.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my mom (late 70s) who is currently getting daily (no weekends) radiation treatments for breast cancer. She is about halfway done - received her 16th dose today - she still has 17 more to go. She started with Cerave on Day 1 and used it for about 7 treatments - but then her skin started to sting/get tender (similar to early sunburn). Another patient suggested Jean&#x27;s Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after application, the pain is gone. My mom, per the other patient&#x27;s suggestion, applies it in the morning after a shower (or after a pat of a wet washcloth), immediately after radiation treatment (hers was around lunch time), late afternoon, and then again before bedtime - that&#x27;s four times. Her skin is nicely tanned but, thankfully, no discomfort. She&#x27;s encouraged to drink a lot of water throughout the day and also takes a mid-afternoon nap, much to her annoyance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her second tube just arrived today. $45 seem a bit pricey but the peace of mind and body that she&#x27;s pain free makes it worth it. Will edit this after her last treatment on August 11.</li>
    <li> Soothing for radiation patient!  My mother said this was a perfect cream for her radiation treatments.  It is soothing and not greasy!  It does not stain clothes like other creams she tried.  On the expensive side, but worth it!</li>
    <li> My husband is going through radiation right now s we have been using it along. He seems to think it is helping with the burn.</li>
    <li> Sure I could have gone with Aquaphor, I did. It was really thick and hurt to put on my burned skin. I got Jean&#x27;s cream and it went on so easy. Also didn&#x27;t leave a thick film on me. I used this with aloe vera and coconut oil. I got red but didn&#x27;t blister.</li>
    <li> I received six weeks of radiation therapy to my chest. I burnt pretty severely while using this product. I don&#x27;t find that there is any advantage to using this over Aquaphor and Aloe.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing!  My husband was going through chemo and radiation treatment for throat and neck cancer and his skin was all raw and burnt from the radiation.  Jeans Cream was highly recommended to him by a man who survived the same type cancer as being the one saving grace for his skin.  I ordered it immediately and it arrived in a few days and my husband started feeling immediate relief from his burning skin.  The raw, redness and peeling quickly disappeared, leaving him with soft, smooth skin.  I,also highly recommend this wonderful, amazing cream for anyone going through radiation or has severe dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> My mom is going through Radiation treatments for breast cancer, and this has prevented her from burning.  It was recommended by her radiologist and she loves it.  She had the same treatment 27 years ago and burned quite badly.  This is great.</li>
    <li> It really helped soothe the angry burn that began pealing. I have ready recommended it to friends that have to go through breast radiation.</li>
    <li> I use Jeans Cream every day as a daily moisturizer because it really nourishes my skin without being greasy. I love it! It&#x27;s also the best thing I&#x27;ve found for taking the red and pain out of a sunburn - works within just a couple hours.</li>
    <li> After researching the best creams to use while going through radiation treatment, I purchased Jeans Cream.  My Radiation Oncologist had a different cream in mind to use while going through Radiation, Calendula Lotion (the paraben free one).  I used the cream RO suggested during the week and with her permission, I used the Jeans Cream on the weekends  I completly healed with no scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While going through radiation, I found it easy to apply the Jeans Cream to my face, too.  I continued to use the lotion on my radiated area and my face, just because it was the easiest thing to do.  This was the only lotion I applied to my face for months. So, skip forward two months.  My my sister commented &amp;#34;your skin looks so good&amp;#34; while looking at my face; my stepmom (who rarely comments on these things) chimed in, your skin really does look good . My sister wanted to know what I&#x27;ve been using so she could buy some.  This lotion is far less expensive than what I used to pay at the Dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> the product arrived on time and in a good conditions. it is very good for the skin care specially for people who are under radiation therapy. i highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m half way thru 30 radiation treatments and so far so good, no problems, i use jeans cream immediately after each treatment (i keep it in my purse) and again each night. I&#x27;m African American just thought I&#x27;d add that because everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but other than being slightly tanned on the radiated area I&#x27;m having no other issues!</li>
