      <li>and I can finish the cut on my own.  </li>
      <li>I cut my own hair with clippers but always need my wife to trim my neck.  </li>
      <li>Works well, nice guide.</li>
      <li>Even I could cut my own hair better than the salon.</li>
      <li>Works ok but keeps  moving</li>
      <li>I can trim better by hand.</li>
      <li>OK, but duct tape works about as well.  </li>
      <li>Even better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not so easy for a selfie cut but can help you for sure.</li>

      <li>only concern I have is the warning to not wear for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Done properly (which is how I do), I can create precise leg hair patterns to replicate the majesty of the great African Zebra, or ... horizontal flags from countries such as Costa Rica, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Kind of a let down.</li>
      <li>This guide was very helpful</li>
      <li>and this solves that problem fast.</li>
      <li>This works really well for getting the neckline stright.</li>
      <li>For example, turn it around and shave a perfectly straight mustache.  </li>
      <li>Saves money on professional services.</li>
      <li>I always had problems of keeping a shaved back neck and creating a straight neck hair line.</li>
      <li>I have been using a vacuum hair cutter for years and struggled to get a even, clean cut on the back of my red neck.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what was expected.</li>

<li> It works well at helping you cut behind your neck without mirrors.  </li>
<li> With duct tape you eliminate the annoying band across your face, but it is a bit tricky to remove when you are done.</li>

    <li> Works like it should. Saves money on professional services.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what was expected. Same thing as pictured. Works!</li>
    <li> This really works, great concept!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it thinking it was worth the risk.  Am I glad I did!  It works well at helping you cut behind your neck without mirrors.  If you cut your own hair... BUY IT!!</li>
    <li> Even I could cut my own hair better than the salon.</li>
    <li> Kind of a let down. Upon opening the product it looked cheaply made (picture a piece of plastic with underwear elastic). There was nothing at all fancy. And nothing to avoid me possibly still cutting an uneven line if I were to put it on crooked. I could have saved my money, and used my hand As a guide. It also wouldn&#x27;t help me at all in trimming my side burns, or bangs in front. Imho.</li>
    <li> I have been using a vacuum hair cutter for years and struggled to get a even, clean cut on the back of my red neck.  This gadget does the trick and it&#x27;s made in the US.  Even better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own neck hair for a long time. I always had problems of keeping a shaved back neck and creating a straight neck hair line. Sometimes I had to ask somebody to fix my neck. This product, the Neck Hair Guide solved all these problems.</li>
    <li> I cut my own hair with clippers but always need my wife to trim my neck.  Now, I only need her to verify that the guide is level and I can finish the cut on my own.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Works ok but keeps  moving</li>
    <li> This is a Christmas gift for my son, so I don&#x27;t know how well this will work....but for the price, if it works...this will save him from going to the barber so often.  ***UPDATE Feb. 19, 2015 - Now that my son has used his gift several times, I&#x27;m updating my review. He said at first try it was a bit clunky to get positioned correctly, Once he got the \\&quot;hang of it\\&quot; and how to adjust the elastic straps he is happy with this Neck Hair Guide. He is going to the barber much less. Have a Nice Day!</li>
    <li> This guide was very helpful In getting a straight neck edge trim which is very difficult to do while looking in a mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not so easy for a selfie cut but can help you for sure.</li>
    <li> Works well, nice guide. I use it every time I cut my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;use to use, nice any flax-able and durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con-&lt;br /&gt;does not tell you what side to use, you have to do some guess work.</li>
    <li> Itz ok, not of much use</li>
    <li> This gets the job done!  Hardest part of giving yourself a trim is the neck and this solves that problem fast.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Was thinking it was made a little stronger.</li>
    <li> I can trim better by hand. This product just gets in the way and makes it harder to get an even trim.</li>
    <li> Great product. No complaints.</li>
    <li> OK, but duct tape works about as well.  With duct tape you eliminate the annoying band across your face, but it is a bit tricky to remove when you are done.</li>
    <li> This works really well for getting the neckline stright.It is also made well-recommend for the home barber.</li>
    <li> Useful with any hair that needs a guide.  For example, turn it around and shave a perfectly straight mustache.  I also really enjoy making hair patterns on my calves.  Done properly (which is how I do), I can create precise leg hair patterns to replicate the majesty of the great African Zebra, or ... horizontal flags from countries such as Costa Rica, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only concern I have is the warning to not wear for more than 5 minutes.  Please fix this issue, so I can wear it as a fashion statement ... even when on the back of the neck, the front of the face is enhanced by the elastic band across my mouth.</li>
