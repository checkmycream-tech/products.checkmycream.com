      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I have used them for many years.  </li>
      <li>These are so great, very portable and easy to use to remove any shine.</li>
      <li>Handy to just throw in your purse and quickly removes the sheen.</li>
      <li>The rose scented powder sheets mop up all excess oil and leaves you with a fresh look and it lasts for hours.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other oil blotting sheets, and these work the best.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be back again, as this product is sensational!  </li>
      <li>but I am very satisfyed with rose, it leaves a beautiful healthy looking coat of pink.</li>
      <li>plus, the scent of the product is rather pleasant, and overall look quite charming and very feminine.</li>
      <li>The light powder on the paper doesn&#x27;t cake onto your face, but instead takes the sheen away.  </li>
      <li>I loved the old ones, but these are inferior quality.</li>
      <li>That being said, this product is quite good, I have combination skin so my nose, chin and forehead tend to get shiny as the day goes by, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find these blotting papers on the market recently I had been using compact powder</li>
      <li>I find these blotting sheets to do everything the maker claims they&#x27;re supposed to, and far much more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never needed a traditional powder compact with these handy.  </li>
      <li>The powder papers are just as good or better than similar items that I used to purchase from other well-known retailers that longer manufacture the papers.  </li>
      <li>but It does not work meerly half as good as these papers do.</li>
      <li>The packaging is so simple yet they are so effective in absorbing oil and eliminating shine.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been quite hot around here.</li>
      <li>Unlike the blue blotters that change color when you blot oil, these are more discreet and don&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;look</li>
      <li>I have been a fan of these blotting papers ever since i bought my first box at a beauty store.</li>
      <li>These papers work magic, absorbs facial oils without leaving a chalky residue feeling.</li>
      <li>So much all my friends want to use them!</li>
      <li>Very practical and absorbs oil better than those clean and clear blotting papers or anything from regular drugstores that I have tried.</li>
      <li>Simple and easy purchasing process.  </li>
      <li>The only drawback is the paper tears too easily.  </li>
      <li>I have found these claims to be purely mythical.</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin</li>
      <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
      <li>So you really do have to blot and not try to wipe the oil away.</li>
      <li>The sheets were much thinner and tear almost every time I use them.</li>
      <li>I did try other brands during the time I could not find this brand and they were Ok</li>
      <li>pretty fast shipping for standard shipping, so</li>
      <li>;  I feel comfortable using these when I&#x27;m around other people.</li>
      <li>I was a concerned when the box arrived beacause it was a little damaged, but the booklets inside are just fine.</li>
      <li>buy two boxes and complete</li>
      <li>Initially I was hesitant to try blotting sheets at all, due to postings and opinions I&#x27;d heard of that claimed that blotting sheets only stripped the skin, and cause it to produce even more oil, and further breakouts.</li>
      <li>As for the color, I am a very pale person and was very tempted to buy the white ones but for some unknown reason I ended up buying the rose ones, they are just the right color, maybe white would have been way to pale for me.</li>
      <li>I have a \\&quot;very\\&quot; oily facial skin, so I must blot my face throughout each day, usually 3 times or more daily.</li>

<li> disappointed 100%</li>
<li> but hate having to reapply makeup throughout the day.</li>
<li> I highly rank this product, that I bought a box.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other oil blotting sheets, and these work the best.  The packaging is so simple yet they are so effective in absorbing oil and eliminating shine.  The only drawback is the paper tears too easily.  So you really do have to blot and not try to wipe the oil away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I was a kid and I&#x27;ve never NOT had them with me.  In fact my friends always remarked on how I always had them with me.  These are so great, very portable and easy to use to remove any shine. I&#x27;ve never needed a traditional powder compact with these handy.  I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without them.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The powder papers are just as good or better than similar items that I used to purchase from other well-known retailers that longer manufacture the papers.  This is a great find.</li>
    <li> I have a \\&quot;very\\&quot; oily facial skin, so I must blot my face throughout each day, usually 3 times or more daily. And after trying other blotting papers, I must say Papier Poudre Oil Blotting Papers is bar far the best blotting paper I&#x27;ve ever used. It is a facial oil blotting paper that has loose powder on it, so you don&#x27;t need to touch up your make-up after blotting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 2 boxes of 12 booklets from this vendor.  I needed a lot, so I ordered 2 kinds.  This one \\&quot;Rose\\&quot; comes in \\&quot;pink\\&quot;, but it&#x27;s only the color of the paper, and not the powder, the powder is neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it after only a few days.. pretty fast shipping for standard shipping, so I&#x27;m very pleased with their service.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been quite hot around here. These papers work magic, absorbs facial oils without leaving a chalky residue feeling. Really like this stuff. So much all my friends want to use them! I love this product for myself!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  These are hard to find and very expensive in beauty supply stores. They are a must for oily skin.  The talc and paper combination pick up the excess oil on skin for a mid day touch up.  A must have...</li>
    <li> Not as expected.  The papers leave clumps of powder on my face.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mid-day makeup refresher.  It removes the excess oil from your face, without drying your skin, or without removing any of your existing make up.  The light powder on the paper doesn&#x27;t cake onto your face, but instead takes the sheen away.  I wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without this product!</li>
    <li> These work great for blotting oil.  Unlike the blue blotters that change color when you blot oil, these are more discreet and don&#x27;t scream &amp;#34;look how oily my face is!&amp;#34;  I feel comfortable using these when I&#x27;m around other people.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  So glad to have found the original and the best on this planet.  I always have to look my best and Papier Poudre allows me to freshen up in seconds!  The rose scented powder sheets mop up all excess oil and leaves you with a fresh look and it lasts for hours.  Simple and easy purchasing process.  Prompt delivery.  I&#x27;ll certainly be back again, as this product is sensational!  I never leave home without it.  I highly rank this product, that I bought a box.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of these blotting papers ever since i bought my first box at a beauty store. I have very oily skin but hate having to reapply makeup throughout the day. These papers come with powder, so they absorb oil and retouch your makeup all at once. Very practical and absorbs oil better than those clean and clear blotting papers or anything from regular drugstores that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I was a concerned when the box arrived beacause it was a little damaged, but the booklets inside are just fine. That being said, this product is quite good, I have combination skin so my nose, chin and forehead tend to get shiny as the day goes by, since I haven&#x27;t been able to find these blotting papers on the market recently I had been using compact powder but It does not work meerly half as good as these papers do. I did try other brands during the time I could not find this brand and they were Ok but none as good as these, there&#x27;s a reason why these papers have been around for over a century. As for the color, I am a very pale person and was very tempted to buy the white ones but for some unknown reason I ended up buying the rose ones, they are just the right color, maybe white would have been way to pale for me. I have no recollection of what color I used to use before I stopped finding them but I am very satisfyed with rose, it leaves a beautiful healthy looking coat of pink.</li>
    <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind in my opinion.  I have used them for many years.  They made nice additions to Christmas stockings.</li>
    <li> I find these blotting sheets to do everything the maker claims they&#x27;re supposed to, and far much more. I initially purchased just a few books, and have just returned to buy a box. They are a staple in my purse. They&#x27;ll instantly lift all of the dirt and oil up and out of the pores, leaving behind a sheer light layer of coloured powder, which keeps the oilies at bay, allowing for less blotting and shine in future. I have rather oily, and acne prone skin however these do not irritate it, nor do they cause breakouts. Initially I was hesitant to try blotting sheets at all, due to postings and opinions I&#x27;d heard of that claimed that blotting sheets only stripped the skin, and cause it to produce even more oil, and further breakouts. I have found these claims to be purely mythical. Do not hesitate to try these, you&#x27;ll wonder why they hadn&#x27;t been a part of your makeup bag all a long. plus, the scent of the product is rather pleasant, and overall look quite charming and very feminine.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering these for a couple of years, and I usually love them. This time the outside package was the same, but the little books had a different cover. The sheets were much thinner and tear almost every time I use them. I am not sure what I&#x27;ll do next time. I loved the old ones, but these are inferior quality.</li>
    <li> fatal this product. not what I expected, I used this brand before but they sent me was something different. the presentation is different and not the one shown in the photo. buy two boxes and complete I have therefore does not fulfill its function. disappointed 100%</li>
    <li> Great for quick touchups on my oily complexion.  Gives a nice matte finish</li>
    <li> Love this product. Handy to just throw in your purse and quickly removes the sheen.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 of the 12 booklet packs over the past 14 months and use them daily to help with my oily skin. I have some in my car, purse, upstairs and downstairs baths. I&#x27;ve used others, but nothing compares to the quality and cost of Papier Poudre. I&#x27;d never buy the ones at the drug stores in the US again! I did so for years and was never 100% satisfied with them or the cost, so I am extremely happy to have found these!</li>
