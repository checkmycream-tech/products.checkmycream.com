    <li> Works very well, make my hair look really good.  Really easy to use and love the different settings. Very Happy</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this spiral iron by BedHead. It makes for beautiful curls that really do last all day!. The stand to hold it up us pretty useless like other people say, but I just place mine on a towel in between curling and it does the trick.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SO AWESOME  MY FIRST CURLER  HEAT FAST  CURL GOOD AND LAST LONG  LOVE THE DESIGN!!! THIS DESIGN IS SO GOOD  IVE USED OTHER PEOPLE&#x27;S CURLERS BEFORE  LIKE A HUGE CLIP  BUT THIS ONE  IS SO EASY TO USE  I JUST CLIP THE END OF MY SECTION OF HAIR AND SPIN THE STICK  THE HAIR GO UP ITSELF WITH THE SHELF ON THE STICK(WHICH REALLY WORKS!!)  NO PROBLEM WITH WIRES OR ANYTHING  THIS IS SO AWESOME  IM SO HAPPY</li>
    <li> Okay so i just got this curler in the mail today (: it is amazing !!! I tried it on four pieces of my hair &amp; it did give definition &amp; shorter curls for me.. At first it looked cheap the only thing i dont like is the wheel for the high &amp; low thing cause my hand gets in the way of it while im curling &amp; turns it to low..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold hair in place well  curing l</li>
    <li> I recently bought this curling iron and i love it already. It produces beautiful, perfect curls that last for days afterwards! Perfect for beginners. Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> Like it but a little hard to use</li>
    <li> I bought this curler because one of my friends has it and her hair always looks amazing! I ordered it on 12/28/13 and I got it today, 01/03/14 and as soon as I got it I opened it and started messing with my hair and the iron. Honestly, my hair never holds my curls but with this curler my curls never fall. It&#x27;s amazing and I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> The best curling iron, I have own so far.  It curls my hair fast and easy, beutiful spiral curls, work best with long hair.  my cousins own three and their hair always looks good, so I decided to get one of my own, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Christmas morning came with all my family, grandchildren included, in front of a huge Christmas tree, all lit up. My house is very old and crowded, but full of love and history. I sat a bit stunned, with so much going on, when suddenly, I got the greatest hug in the world! It was my beautiful grandaughter, with that curling iron you sold me in her hand. She loves it! And I loved Amazon for the quick delivery - earlier than promised, and at Christmas, too! Thank you. Mary Ann Prather</li>
    <li> I love the curls it puts in my hair!  The only thing that bothers me is where the temperature button is located.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is terrible.  It does not have a firm hold on end of your hair in order to wrap the rest around the curling iron.  An absolute waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have used this sprial iron only a couple times, but it works AMAZING! Most other iron&#x27;s are ot hard for me to use, but this is super easy and takes only a couple mintues to do all of my hair. I Love it a lot!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try this cool curler out! I have very long hair so spirals usually work best for me. Amazon shipped it fast so that was nice.</li>
    <li> Has anyone else noticed the video for this wand does NOT match the product image? In the video, there are five spirals, but the product itself has only FOUR. Perhaps not a big deal, except it is possible having one less spiral *could* be a big deal depending on your hair length. Or does the product itself actually have five spirals, and the product picture is incorrect?</li>
    <li> This review is written by my wife:  Bought this for my teenage daughter.  Lately I&#x27;ve been stealing it, I mean borrowing it, for myself.  I have shoulder length hair which doesn&#x27;t usually hold a curl.  I put some styling mousse in my hair, let it air dry a bit and then curl with with the Bed Head Spiral Iron - curls last ALL DAY!  Love this curling iron.  Looking to see what other products Bed Head makes.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and she loves it. The price was right and it works great, [or so I&#x27;m told].</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and small enough to work with my short hair. Love it.</li>
    <li> This curling iron is the best i&#x27;ve ever had. I could NEVER get any curling iron to work on my hair and this one is simply amazing. I love it.</li>
    <li> This has to be the first time in my life that a curling iron made me feel stupid. I watched the video and the girl did it so effortlessly. She lies. She must have practiced for months. As far as I can tell the problem is the clamp that is suppose to hold the hair in place while you curl it. It is way to short and way to loose. My hair just pulls through it every time. Second is trying to get the hair to curl up the wand without getting caught on the top of the wire. I noticed on the left side it curls one direction and on the right another which makes the curls look a little weird and frizzy. It also seems to work best on small pieces of hair of course then the hair slips out of the clamp. Much like others have observed the buttons seem to be placed in a manner that you can&#x27;t help but turn the curling iron off and the heat down at random moments. It took me half and hour to do my hair. I tried it 3 seperate times. Today I just went back to my tiny curling iron. It has never once called me stupid!</li>
    <li> My hair is too short to get any benefit from the spiral.  However, it does hold a tight curl.  gets very hot, so curl lasts.</li>
    <li> Although this iron was actually the iron I was looking for (and I could never find it being sold in stores), it sadly was not the best product I could have bought. It pulls my hair out a lot when I use it and the heat temp is on the side making it really easy to turn down while in use.</li>
    <li> The curling iron curls really great and does the job.  I received the package on time. It is light and simple and works for kids hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister as her first curling iron (for her 12th birthday). Let&#x27;s say I &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; it all the time. I even &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; it to bring with me on trips. It is very easy to use for a first time curler iron user- my sister has no problems using it and got the hang of it right away. For a curling iron pro like myself, it does not get as hot as I&#x27;m used to but that&#x27;s a good thing. It still get&#x27;s hot enough to do it&#x27;s job. This makes beautiful curls! Although if you have very long hair (I do), it is harder to work with. I have to curl each strand twice- starting with the bottom half and than work my way up to the top. However, I have to do this with most curlers because of the sheer length of my hair. I definitely would recommend this to anyone- particularly inexperienced users!</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not talented enough, but I have yet to have a good turn out with this iron.  It&#x27;s kinda hard to use and I&#x27;ve basically given up and moved on.</li>
    <li> The one thing you can&#x27;t tell when you buy something on line is how it actually operates.  This spiral iron would be fine except that the on/off buttons are placed on the handle so each time you secure the hair with the short clip, your natural grip to turn it hits the on/off button and turns it off.  I have tried to hold the unit in other places to avoid inadvertently shutting it off but it is just too cumbersome and hard to manage.  I have owned many curling irons, flat irons and the like so I just took the device out of  the package and threw the package away.  Had I been able to retrieve it from the trash, I would have returned this tool.</li>
    <li> This iron works.  However, it takes serious practice.  It&#x27;s a good thing it has a clamp, but you have to take the tiniest of sections of your hair to spiral around this iron.  Moreover, you have to use it counterclockwise otherwise your hair will not go up the spiral.  You may get it to spiral but it won&#x27;t work properly which I found out.  Plus trying to get larger sections in will get a looser spiral if you can make it in.  I did a few times, but the iron &amp;#34;insists&amp;#34; it must have much smaller sections or else those sections will fall out before ever making it up the iron.  Also the few times I obtained larger and looser spirals they fell out quickly.  To do it correctly, takes some practice, but you&#x27;ll be rewarded with beautiful spirals.  It really takes a lot of patience to finish your entire head.  With tons of practice you may get it done within 40 minutes so long as your hair is not thick.  Plus, if you&#x27;re like me and needed some practice, it will show--the ends of your hair will look somewhat damaged which happened to me.  You are only supposed to leave the iron in your hair for 3-5 seconds.  However, most likely you&#x27;ll be doing it over which will kill the ends.  So, if you want the look, I suggest you put some brand of argon oil treatment on the ends BEFORE you use this iron unless you are an amazing expert!  It is a good idea to follow the directions depending on your hair type like fine or thick.  It tells you to put it on a low setting for those who have fine or limp hair.  Higher settings like medium and high for medium to thick hair.  It doesn&#x27;t take very long for this spiral iron to heat up which was nice.  However, the style was quick to fall out even though I used hairspray.  I suggest getting a body perm before using this or any iron--that should really help with locking in the style.  If you use it incorrectly, it can be frustrating. Otherwise it leaves a gorgeous style.</li>
    <li> It works really well, much better than other irons my daughter has tried.  Curls last a longer period of time and is easy to operate.  Highly recommend to anyone that is frustrated with Spiral irons that don&#x27;t work well.</li>
    <li> What can I say...I plugged this curling iron in and it exploded from the clamp area. Sparks were everywhere and it left my hand black and blistered. NEVER BUYING BED AGAIN!!!</li>
    <li> This hair curler works well; took us a few trys to figure out which direction to curl once you have the strands of hair under the clamp, but once we got that down, the curler made beautiful spirals.  AND this was given to two different teenage girls -- eyes lit up both times!!  Phew!!  So, if you&#x27;re not sure what to get that teenage girl who gives you no clue what she wants, give this a try.  Only draw back is that the \\&quot;stand\\&quot; that the handle has is basically useless, so one needs to be careful how you lay it on the counter as the whole silver area gets pretty hot.  Outside of that I give it Two thumbs up for quality (so far) and making a nice curl.  Decent price.</li>
    <li> Great iron producing great curles! great iron for all hair types with a dial for each kind! The only cons are all the curls go the same way and when you curl the dial on the side moves turing the heat up and down accidentally, the cord also gets wrapped up too. But seriosuly this is a great iron dont let the bad reviews fool you I love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Love it</li>
    <li> I like this curler but, I have one that I like better....it is by the brand &#x27;Plugged In&#x27; from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. I just wish the one from Sally&#x27;s came in other sizes.</li>
    <li> I have long, thin, layered fine hair and it usually doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well.  Hot rollers are a pain and time consuming. I thought I would give this a try as the price was good...fabulous results! The curling wand is easy to use and takes no time to set the curl. It&#x27;s a little tricky getting the ends in but once you&#x27;re \\&quot;wound-up\\&quot; you can twist and release the catch part and slide the ends in. Today it took about 5 min to do all my hair. I run my fingers through the curls then spritz and they stay pretty much all day.  Very happy : )</li>
    <li> Took me a bit to figure out how to use it properly [make sure your hair is between the spiral sections] without my hair crimping in spots. Makes great curls that really stay in. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the stand is terrible. It doesn&#x27;t do anything so if you don&#x27;t want to burn your counter use a silicone hot pad to sit it on.</li>
    <li> Arrived a day late  but its arright heats up in 20-30 seconds curls dont last very long but  its not any different then the curling wand .</li>
    <li> I have been wanting one of these spiral curling irons for a long time and now that i finally got one I love it!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is awesome, the curls are beautiful last longer than my regular curling iron. It does take some time to figure out how to use with the little clip at the bottom, but if you watch the video on youtube it will explain how to use it so it wont be a crease on the end of the curl.</li>
    <li> This by far is the BEST curling iron I have ever used. And believe me I know curling irons.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me. It is inexpensive and works great. I love this curling iron. I use it all the time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter and she says it works great!</li>
    <li> This was too hard for me to handle with a bad wrist, but I passed it on to my daughter. After a few times, she barely uses it, said she wasn&#x27;t real pleased with results because spirals didn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
    <li> Overall, I am very happy with this.  We used it this morning for school pictures and it did indeed spiral curl my daughters hair.  My only complaint is the placement and design of the temperature dial.  Every time I spun the rod around my finger woudl accidentally hit this dial and either turn it up or down.  Not a major deal and I am still glad I bought it just thought it was worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this thing!!! I have a chin-length A-line bob and thick hair that is very resistant to curl. I was skeptical of the package instructions, which advised me to hold each curl for only 5-8 seconds. However, I decided to follow the instructions to the letter for my first try, rather than risk damaging my hair. Lo and behold! After just 8 seconds (on the highest heat setting), I had the most gorgeous, smooth, soft spiral curl I&#x27;ve ever had! After 12 minutes, my whole head was done. One quick shake and a hairspray later and I was good to go! My only complaints are that the on/off buttons &amp; heat-setting dial get in the way, plus the clip is a bit short, so it only holds very small sections of hair. My biggest problem: I kept inadvertently turning the heat dial and shutting off the iron as I wrapped each curl. But even that issue does not deter me from giving this device a whole-hearted 5 stars. It heats up AND cools down very quickly, making it nice for travel. I daresay the Bed Head 3/4\\&quot; Spiral Iron creates one of the easiest and cutest hairstyles I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> I expected much more out of this. While the iron does heat up quick and make beautiful curls, the curls do not hold long. I curled my daughter&#x27;s hair for a dance and by the time the dance was over, her curls had already came almost completely out. I would return, but it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle with Amazon anymore. Oh, and the heat adjustment wheel is horrible. Your constantly turning the wheel everytime you roll your hair which can then leave you with a not so hot iron.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teen daughter, but when I tried it on my hair....well lets say we fight over it!  I have thick wavy frizzy hair, and this made my curls very defined and frizz free!  The only thing I didnt like was the settings dial, I turn it to low when I twist it.  Kind of hard to maneuver, but I figured it out quickly and LOVE IT!!</li>
    <li> Loved this product, no more struggling with rollers, just curl and go, easy to use just curl and go now</li>
    <li> Awesome price and works really well. I didn&#x27;t expect it to make such nice curls in my hair, but it did! Glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, however, hard to use.</li>
    <li> Package came fast! I&#x27;ve had this product before, but misplaced mine.  So I bought it again! I&#x27;m that excited about how it works! :) The button does gets turned off several time while I&#x27;m curling my hair, but it curls so nicely that I still think it&#x27;s worth buying,even with that flaw....Although I do think it would be nice if they would relocate the on/off buttons.  I really like the pink color too :) Amazon Prime shipped really fast too! :)</li>
    <li> I get the most natural looking wavy curls when i use this. the trick is to do it once, brush it out and then do it again.</li>
    <li> At first I was surprised at the negative remarks posted.  It took a couple of tries to see that it moves your hair into the grooves going one way only.  It curls into beautiful spirals!!  But I have to agree with the person&#x27;s post about the design flaw in putting the rolling temperature controllers and on/off button right where your hand and thumb go to roll your hair.  Consequently, the dials are constantly being moved up and down and the iron has to readjust the temperature all the time.  Then if your thumb hits the button it turns off without you even seeing it happen.  It is bugging me more and more so much so that I&#x27;m on the lookout for another brand to try.</li>
    <li> Product is alright. Gets hot enough. Clip that holds hair in place to begin to curl is very loose and doesn&#x27;t hold hair at all so it makes it very difficult to curl in a timely fashion. BUT the spiral design cant be beat. That&#x27;s the best part. Makes wonderful curls in the end. But not always worth the struggle with getting it to that point. Very fast shipping!</li>
    <li> When I got it the clamp kept braking and the heat setting does not work very well when I tried curling my daughters hair she said she does not like how it curls well thanks anyway</li>
    <li> wonderful product love it. it get very, very hot a produces tight wonderful spiral curls. I just love to do my hair with it and the curls last forever.</li>
    <li> This item is made well and easy to use.  My hair does not slip out as with other curling irons from different manufacturers did.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Surprised by these rave reviews! I&#x27;m back to order a different iron &amp; thought, since I purchased this based on the rave reviews, I would save someone $15 and lots of frustration! I do not see how this iron does anything a regular 3/4 curling iron doesn&#x27;t do. The spiral thing only works in one direction so all the curls on your whole head go the same way, looks weird. I HATE the tiny clip, my hair is lightly layered at the bottom so getting more than a very small bit of hair in it is an exercise in restrain (not cursing while the toddler stares at mommy fussing with her hair). The worst part is the heat adjustment wheel is EXACTLY where you hold the wand and as you wind your hair, you turn the knob and the heat. While doing my hair in the week since receiving this collosal design fail I decided that the person who designed this thing must be a bald man who would never actually ever use one of these curling irons! I was hoping this would be the answer to soft waves in the summer heat. About an inch of your hair at the bottom sticks out of the clip won&#x27;t hold so you have to go back through and redo all the ends (go on and try, please, not to swear again!). And the cord takes on it&#x27;s own life and tries to crawl up your arm so you&#x27;re unwinding that over and over. It does create gorgeous curls. Seriously bad design. Keep looking.</li>
    <li> I like it because my 6th grader did not have any issues with it!  The curls came out &amp;#34;curly&amp;#34;!!!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got this as a christmas gift for my little sister in law and she loves it! Especially the pink handle! Works great too!</li>
    <li> This is a good iron. Takes a while to curl your hair, but I like it.</li>
    <li> It works great on my long hair. It&#x27; hard to get something to curl and keep a curl when your hair is so long. This iron does. Thanks</li>
    <li> bought this fo rmy daughter and she loves it very much. I would reccommend it to anyone. heats up very well</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! it works great with long and short hair!!! it&#x27;s a steal, other places are $30-$45 ; this was less than half of that price! &amp; came within 4 days of purchasing :)</li>
    <li> Heats up really quickly and is great for long or short hair - as long as you curl a little at a time.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS IT GIVES REALY NICE CURLS :) SO HAPPY WITH IT! YOU SHOULD REALLY ORDER THIS ITS THE BEST</li>
    <li> I have no problems using the thing to make spirols, the problem is that the switch to turn up/down the heat moves too easily.  I have really long hair, and therefore need to twist/turn the curling iron many times.  The heat inadvertanly lowers while doing this.  It really sucks!</li>
    <li> The spiral iron makes beautiful spiral curls!! I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone!! :-)</li>
    <li> Easiest way to use is to have someone else curl your hair with this...</li>
    <li> Heats quickly, makes great curls.  I am still learning to use it in the back, but it works great and would buy again</li>
    <li> This works great , I would recommend to everyone who likes the look of spiral curls. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use .</li>
    <li> Arrived the day AFTER Christmas, which was disappointing, but that was not the fault of the product which is great.</li>
    <li> not thrilled with it....it&#x27;s just ok</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas - worked for about 10 minutes!  Now does not even get warm!  Poor quality!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron is poorly made. When you use it, you can easily turn it off due to the button placement. The spirals are also very awkward. Buy a wand or another spiral iron.</li>
    <li> The clamp doesn&#x27;t clamp down very tight so my hair slides out and messes up the curl. The temperature setting is too easy to move and if I accidently hit it unintentionally it changes, usually to a higher temperature and I don&#x27;t want that.</li>
    <li> great product Bed Head 3/4&amp;#34; Spiral Iron, Bed Head 3/4&amp;#34; Spiral Iron , Bed Head 3/4&amp;#34; Spiral Iron , Bed Head 3/4&amp;#34; Spiral Iron</li>
    <li> Bad design, when twirling it your hand will hit the temperature knob and everything changes. The clip is alright but the whole iron is too bulky for my liking. However with practice you should be able to get the hang of it. Place hair between the spirals to avoid crinkles.</li>
    <li> THIS ONE IS GREAT HAD ONE YEARS AGO I THOUGHT THEY STOPPED MAKING THEM SO HAPPY I FOUND IT!!!!</li>
    <li> Gives great curls and works well received within two days of purchase. Recommended if you want fast cute curls. The price is fair and does what it is suppose too.</li>
    <li> This says it is, but when you have to hold it for a few seconds in a curl on you FINGER. Whats up with that. Im just learning to be more \\&quot;girly\\&quot;, but I even know what a curling iron is!</li>
