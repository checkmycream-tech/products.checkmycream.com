      <li>I love his brush!</li>
      <li>This brush is nice.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and throught for sure that this brush would work on my course textured hair, but I just cannot get a good thorough brush stroke through my hair with it.  </li>
      <li>Nice, quality brush.  </li>
      <li>It works okay, but the plastic bristles are kind of scratchy on my head.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and a sensitive scalp and this brush feels great!</li>
      <li>I could have paid much more for another brush,  but why?</li>
      <li>It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth and shiny!  </li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels after brushing with this.</li>
      <li>I love this brush.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this brush.</li>
      <li>This will probably cause more bristle shedding.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m totally enjoying this brush.</li>
      <li>No bristles have fallen out in the many weeks</li>
      <li>I am sure that I will enjoy many tears of use with this quality product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice way to distribute natural oils and also feels good on your scalp.  </li>
      <li>What can I say,  the Natural Bristle Hair Brush does a great job &amp; it is confortable to hold when brushing.  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s true!</li>
      <li>THE PRICE IS GOOD FOR THE HIGH QUALITY OF THIS BRUSH.</li>
      <li>If you have a lot of fine hair, this brush will be your friend.</li>
      <li>the brush is well made; wooden handle feels good in the hand and the bristles stay on the brush.</li>
      <li>(You wouldn&#x27;t think so, but it&#x27;s true.)</li>
      <li>After ten years of loving this product.</li>
      <li>and I love that it is natural</li>
      <li>I like the idea of a ntural style brush, but in this case it isn&#x27;t the right brush for my hair.</li>
      <li>I read somewhere that a natural bristle brush is great for long hair when you skip washing.</li>
      <li>Certainly cheap enough that I can easily replace it.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels so much better after regular use with this brush.</li>
      <li>pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Might lose a few more bristles soon, but it&#x27;s holding up just fine.</li>
      <li>I was happy to find this brush as natural or nylon bristle brushes of any quality are becoming harder and harder to find.</li>
      <li>the same time as buying this one, I also bought a wooden bristle brush, which works and feel better with my fine straight hair, and it&#x27;s nicer on my scalp.</li>
      <li>Nice brush, bristles are short &amp; stiff; so not as good for long hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>This is really making a difference in the feel and look of my hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I have long hair, so I&#x27;ve been using it less on my scalp, and more on the ends, and it does smooth my hair</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I needed a replacement for a very old (10+ years?)</li>
      <li>the bristles are so short, which also means, I don&#x27;t get a scalp massage that other reviewers are enjoying.</li>
      <li>After this most recent purchase, the bristles have been replaced with something synthetic and way too coarse it actually damages my hair.</li>
      <li>I have not used a natural bristle brush in like forever</li>
      <li>so soft.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using brushes made from boar bristles for awhile and noticed the difference immediately wIth the natural bristles.</li>
      <li>However, I was expecting natural bristles, not plastic ones.</li>
      <li>I have thick hair and didn&#x27;t think the bristles would be able manage it</li>
      <li>Prob works better on people with thin hair.</li>
      <li>I was very spoiled because my old brush had soft bristles and these are extremely stiff.  </li>
      <li>Lost a few bristles in the first week; no big deal.</li>

    <li> I love his brush! It tames my FlyAway&#x27;s so well and I love that it is natural</li>
    <li> so soft. I absolutely love this brush! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been purchasing this brush for a decade now. It has changed through the years here and there. I have to say, after the minor changes it has made recently It has gone downhill. After this most recent purchase, the bristles have been replaced with something synthetic and way too coarse it actually damages my hair. After ten years of loving this product. I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This brush is nice. I love the way my hair feels after brushing with this.</li>
    <li> The brush is a little scratchy on my scalp and it seems to make my hair feel greasy ~ so I only use it at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I chose this brush because I thought it was all 100% board bristles. Don&#x27;t be deceived!!! This brush has boar bristles reinforced by nylon/plastic ones. It works okay, but the plastic bristles are kind of scratchy on my head. Not what I was hoping for! I have long hair, so I&#x27;ve been using it less on my scalp, and more on the ends, and it does smooth my hair pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time as buying this one, I also bought a wooden bristle brush, which works and feel better with my fine straight hair, and it&#x27;s nicer on my scalp. (You wouldn&#x27;t think so, but it&#x27;s true.)</li>
    <li> I love this brush.  It makes my hair look great, always.  If you have a lot of fine hair, this brush will be your friend.</li>
    <li> Prob works better on people with thin hair. I have to brush my hair in layers with this brush bc the bristles are so short, which also means, I don&#x27;t get a scalp massage that other reviewers are enjoying. the brush is well made; wooden handle feels good in the hand and the bristles stay on the brush. However, I was expecting natural bristles, not plastic ones.</li>
    <li> I read somewhere that a natural bristle brush is great for long hair when you skip washing. Which i just started to do due to my hair dryng out. I hate the gresey look my hair got. This brush it prefect!!! It did not pull my hair which others did and helps with moving the oils thought my hair. Its great!</li>
    <li> Awesome brush!! Fast shipping. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> THIS HAIRBRUSH IS EXCELLENT; IT IS TRULY THE BEST I HAVE EVER OWN... THE PRICE IS GOOD FOR THE HIGH QUALITY OF THIS BRUSH. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!</li>
    <li> If you have long hair and of any thickness, this will not work for you too well.  Try something else.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. No bristles have fallen out in the many weeks I&#x27;ve had it. My hair looks and feels so much better after regular use with this brush.</li>
    <li> I have not used a natural bristle brush in like forever but I was reading about the benefits to your hair, so. And it&#x27;s true! This is really making a difference in the feel and look of my hair. I&#x27;m totally enjoying this brush.</li>
    <li> Nice brush, bristles are short &amp; stiff; so not as good for long hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using brushes made from boar bristles for awhile and noticed the difference immediately wIth the natural bristles. It&#x27;s definitely gentler on my hair.I have thick hair and didn&#x27;t think the bristles would be able manage it but it has and I&#x27;m really pleased. In addition, it doesn&#x27;t break the hair.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush and great quality for the price.  It&#x27;s a nice way to distribute natural oils and also feels good on your scalp.  I&#x27;m glad I found this brush.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this brush as natural or nylon bristle brushes of any quality are becoming harder and harder to find. I am sure that I will enjoy many tears of use with this quality product.</li>
    <li> Lost a few bristles in the first week; no big deal. I use it a few times a day, and five months in it is starting to show some wear. Might lose a few more bristles soon, but it&#x27;s holding up just fine. Definitely gets the job done. Certainly cheap enough that I can easily replace it. Have never owned a hairbrush before, so I have nothing to compare this against, but other than the aforementioned, I have nothing really negative to say about it.</li>
    <li> What can I say,  the Natural Bristle Hair Brush does a great job &amp; it is confortable to hold when brushing.  The cost was a good price. I could have paid much more for another brush,  but why? I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a ntural style brush, but in this case it isn&#x27;t the right brush for my hair. I will keep it and use it, but I will prbably look for somthing with a stiffer bristle as to avoid the frizzyness.</li>
    <li> Great brush.  We only use it on dry hair.  It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair smooth and shiny!  Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Nice brush at a good price.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for a very old (10+ years?) Goody padded 100% boar bristle hairbrush - and this looked like a good one.&lt;br /&gt;Construction is good.  I was very spoiled because my old brush had soft bristles and these are extremely stiff.  I am hopeful that over time it will also soften up.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair (below the waist) and it tends to break.&lt;br /&gt;Only two &amp;#34;cons&amp;#34; - the brush is shedding bristles each time I remove the hair from it, and it is difficult to remove the hair - I am going  to have to try using a comb to comb it out.  This will probably cause more bristle shedding.</li>
    <li> Nice, quality brush.  I have fine hair and a sensitive scalp and this brush feels great!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and throught for sure that this brush would work on my course textured hair, but I just cannot get a good thorough brush stroke through my hair with it.  Would not buy it again.</li>
