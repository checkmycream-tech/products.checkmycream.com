      <li>This deodorant has no parabens or aluminum and it works amazingly.</li>
      <li>I was turned on to Herban Cowboy Deodorant after using their soap (which is amazing).  </li>
      <li>Really nice smell</li>
      <li>More of an evening use, good smell but without an 8 hour protection cycle.</li>

      <li>arrived quickly and great price.</li>
      <li>Nice product, easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Way better than Toms.</li>
      <li>If you smell, then apply more.</li>
      <li>It also smells and works a lot better than Tom&#x27;s when it comes to functioning as a deodorant.</li>
      <li>I was just trying to go more healthy, but this product is ineffective for my stinkers.</li>

      <li>love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>Love the smell, so does the wife, not over powering and lasts all day even if I&#x27;m sweating a lot.</li>
      <li>Great natural product!!!</li>
      <li>, it works and smells great for a natural deodorant</li>
      <li>He liked it so much he already ordered 2 more sticks.  </li>
      <li>I think the trick is if you have strong odor, just wash under your arms each day -</li>
      <li>First off, I noticed it smelled great on top of it having natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product.  </li>
      <li>The product applies smooth and does not stain your shirt (important).  </li>
      <li>The smell is good, my girlfriend approves and really likes it, but the slightest bit of sweat will wash it away, leaving you with a real &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>Works all day, great smell, and I don&#x27;t get that hunky clogged up feeling as with other deoderants.</li>
      <li>Cleans up off your hands quick with a dash of water and a rub.</li>
      <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>Like that it is more natural though.</li>
      <li>This product works better than old spice deodorant.  </li>
      <li>Product is truly worth 1 star, but I gave it 2 for the smell.</li>
      <li>Even though this isn&#x27;t the cheapest, it is 100% worth it--</li>
      <li>It smells outstanding, actually WORKS, and is well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>but it has a hideous, perfumey smell that is WAY too strong and not at all natural.</li>
      <li>I bought this natural aluminum free deodorant</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used every organic deodorant I&#x27;ve seen in a health food store, and they all smell pretty lady-like.  </li>
      <li>Full of natural and organic ingredients, yet</li>
      <li>Really like this  </li>
      <li>it smells 100% like a toxic deodorant like Right Guard, Axe, Old Spice, etc.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long but does smell great upon initial application.  </li>
      <li>I have used old spice pure sport stock for years, and it has worked really well.</li>
      <li>My armpits did not smell fresh at the end of the day with this product as they do with an antiperspirant such as Degree, which has worked very well for me for years.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this to any guy.</li>
      <li>and it works better and lasts longer than any other natural deodorant I have used.</li>
      <li>In the end, not a huge deal as long as you are cognizant and keep it handy.</li>
      <li>I got a wild hair one day and decided to try something else, so I purchased this.</li>
      <li>I thought this was going to be a natural deodorant</li>
      <li>The dusk scent is masculine, but not overbearing.  </li>
      <li>And, it&#x27;s vegan, which is also a major selling point.</li>
      <li>I bought this deodorant for my husband since we try to buy as much natural and organic and possible.  </li>
      <li>especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is the only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve found to actually work.</li>

<li> No goopy, thick, oily, pits with this!</li>
<li> I pop the left-overs out on the support base of the container, store it in the cap upside down and manually apply the rest until its all gone.</li>
<li> Unfortunately the product did not mask the odor of my perspiration.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I find by 5PM, some of the odor peeks through, which requires reapplication.  </li>
<li> and although I think it is pricey, we are not getting rid of expensive shirts too soon.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The fragrance does not last!</li>
    <li> I concur with the review of Marcus Brody. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because I wish they would redesign the container so you could get to all of the product without wasting any! Being that you pay $10-$13 for this in a health store you want to use up the entire product. Granted it&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon but still no sense in being wasteful. When I get to the bottom I pop the left-overs out on the support base of the container, store it in the cap upside down and manually apply the rest until its all gone. Cleans up off your hands quick with a dash of water and a rub. Otherwise this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Love the smell, so does the wife, not over powering and lasts all day even if I&#x27;m sweating a lot.</li>
    <li> works well. doesn&#x27;t smell offensive.  arrived quickly and great price.</li>
    <li> I have used old spice pure sport stock for years, and it has worked really well. I got a wild hair one day and decided to try something else, so I purchased this. The smell is good, my girlfriend approves and really likes it, but the slightest bit of sweat will wash it away, leaving you with a real &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; scent. Product is truly worth 1 star, but I gave it 2 for the smell.</li>
    <li> I start using this product over one year ago. it is a great product and im very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant because it deodorizes without leaving stains in his white undershirt. I love the scent. We will continue to order this product.</li>
    <li> Only stuff I can find that doesn&#x27;t burn...if I only use it one time a day. Thought I would never find anything that didn&#x27;t burn my armpits till this stuff. Hope they keep making it.</li>
    <li> Really nice smell and it works better and lasts longer than any other natural deodorant I have used.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works all day, great smell, and I don&#x27;t get that hunky clogged up feeling as with other deoderants.</li>
    <li> This deoderant is awesome! Smells great and does the job. And, it&#x27;s vegan, which is also a major selling point. I would recommend this product to friends &amp; family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used every organic deodorant I&#x27;ve seen in a health food store, and they all smell pretty lady-like.  Some are neutral at best, but none smell like a MAN.  Well, enter this wonderful Organic Grooming Dusk deodorant.  Full of natural and organic ingredients, yet it smells 100% like a toxic deodorant like Right Guard, Axe, Old Spice, etc.  It smells outstanding, actually WORKS, and is well worth the price.  I actually paid $12.99 at my local health food store, but I see it&#x27;s on sale here for cheaper.  Highly recommend this to any guy.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and get a bad rash when I use regular deodorants like Old Spice. Even Tom&#x27;s products made me break out occasionally, and I often found that I&#x27;d start getting stinky halfway through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to use Herban Cowboy since fragrances are my skin&#x27;s enemy, but I gave this a shot after reading the other reviews. First off, I noticed it smelled great on top of it having natural ingredients. Even better, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out and it leaves me smelling good all day. Even though this isn&#x27;t the cheapest, it is 100% worth it-- especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this yesterday, put it on, and immediately regretted it. It&#x27;s disgusting. I thought this was going to be a natural deodorant but it has a hideous, perfumey smell that is WAY too strong and not at all natural. I will never use it again.</li>
    <li> Way better than Toms. This deodorant has no parabens or aluminum and it works amazingly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only deodorant that I can trust and that actually works. Plus it&#x27;s good for you.</li>
    <li> One of the best smelling healthy deodorants and it won&#x27;t ruin your shirts like Burts Bees does. Unfortunately the product did not mask the odor of my perspiration. If you have stinky pits like I do, you may need to use a traditional antiperspirant. My armpits did not smell fresh at the end of the day with this product as they do with an antiperspirant such as Degree, which has worked very well for me for years. I was just trying to go more healthy, but this product is ineffective for my stinkers.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this product.  It has a wonderful scent and a really nice feel to it.  No goopy, thick, oily, pits with this!</li>
    <li> Nice product, easy to apply.  Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long but does smell great upon initial application.  I prefer the other fragrance smells that are sold by Herban Cowboy.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell of this stuff on my husband. Like that it is more natural though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years, trying others off and on.  This is one of the only ones that does not irritate me.  It also smells and works a lot better than Tom&#x27;s when it comes to functioning as a deodorant.</li>
    <li> works well with one application daily</li>
    <li> Been using this for awhile, great musk aroma and gives good coverage.  Would have given it 5 stars but this isn&#x27;t an all day work out type of deodorant.  More of an evening use, good smell but without an 8 hour protection cycle.</li>
    <li> smells great, shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> My husband got rid of several white shirts and undershirts because he thought it was sweating that made them yellow in the underarms.  I read it is the aluminum in the deodorant that makes the shirts yellow.  I bought this natural aluminum free deodorant and although I think it is pricey, we are not getting rid of expensive shirts too soon.</li>
    <li> This product works better than old spice deodorant.  I think the trick is if you have strong odor, just wash under your arms each day - I have to wash every two days with this.  Great natural product!!!</li>
    <li> Really like this  , it works and smells great for a natural deodorant</li>
    <li> love this deodorant. If you smell, then apply more.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this brand.  Shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I bought this deodorant for my husband since we try to buy as much natural and organic and possible.  We were both happily suprised when it worked so well.  He liked it so much he already ordered 2 more sticks.  And, it lasts longer than other deodorants he&#x27;s purchased before.</li>
    <li> It is the only natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve found to actually work.</li>
    <li> I was turned on to Herban Cowboy Deodorant after using their soap (which is amazing).  The dusk scent is masculine, but not overbearing.  It does not compete with your cologne, but if you test your odor level up close, you can detect the dusk scent throughout the day.  Buying this, I already knew it wasn&#x27;t an anti-perspirant.  I use a Rx anti-perspirant before bed and apply this in the morning.  The product applies smooth and does not stain your shirt (important).  The only downside I have found is it doesn&#x27;t last the entire day.  Living in Texas, you learn coping mechanisms to escape the summer heat.  Unfortunately, I find by 5PM, some of the odor peeks through, which requires reapplication.  In the end, not a huge deal as long as you are cognizant and keep it handy.</li>
