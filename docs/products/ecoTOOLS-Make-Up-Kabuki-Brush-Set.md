<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Perfect for my needs.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very soft, but after only a couple weeks the bristles on the concealer brush are turning in the base. It&#x27;s almost as if they will start to fall out soon. I&#x27;m still using them; I will amend this review should the problem get worse.</li>
    <li> This is a great little set for doing my foundation and highlighting/contouring routine. The brushes are very soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed any shedding. The handles are really cute and they&#x27;re a great size for travel and every day use. I use these liquids, creams, and powder.</li>
    <li> they were pretty &amp; ok, but seemed too small to handle &amp; the brushes are not thick enough for my needs.</li>
    <li> The set is just as described! The brushes are very useful and soft, I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants their face makeup done well!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good contour and blush brush. I saw this Kabuki set for a really good price, plus there were many positive reviews. I use the bronze one for a blush brush and works just as great. The concealer brush is densely packed and feels like your finger when applying your concealer/highlights. The bristles are super soft, the brushes are lightweight and I like the different pattern designs.</li>
    <li> Too small. I gave these away. The bristles were OK and they didn&#x27;t shed, but there&#x27;s better brushes out there with longer handles.</li>
    <li> Love these little cute brushes and key word is little so if u need something bigger these might not be good for u but these last awhile especially if u clean your brushes regularly.</li>
    <li> I bought this set because it&#x27;s compact and I made the right decision. These brushes pick up the powders and liquid makeup very well. And the bristles feel so nice against my skin, it is not at all rough.</li>
    <li> So soft, picks up powders well and blends wonderfully!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product</li>
    <li> The bristles on the Kabuki brush located 2nd from left came apart while pulling it out of package.</li>
    <li> THE BRUSHES ARE A M U S T!! THEY ARE REALLY SOFT AND ARE EXACTLY WHAT YOU NEED IF YOU ARE TRAVELING BCAUSE THEY ARE SMALL AND EASY TO CARRY IN A SMALL MAKEUP BAG</li>
    <li> These are really nice brushes. They are totally worth the price. I really like that ecoTOOLS make affordable, good quality products. This is how they should make all products.</li>
    <li> Ok for the price you pay</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes for the price. They&#x27;re very soft and the various types work well. They came quickly and looked just as advertised.</li>
    <li> These are seriously awesome.  Soft and well made.</li>
    <li> Wanted this set to learn how to contour and enjoy them however I wish I would have purchased a set with longer stems. I can still use them for travel :)</li>
    <li> this is a great traveling kit. i personally love my big handle brushes for my clients, but these are just four litle treasures that i keep for myself.</li>
    <li> Great brushes. No bristles left on face like cheap brushes. Wish it had travel case.</li>
    <li> I love this brand of brushes. They are so soft and don&#x27;t fall apart. I will continue to purchase EcoTools!</li>
    <li> Recipient was thrilled with this gift.</li>
    <li> Love the brushes soft and feel wonderful</li>
    <li> I use these brushes every day! They are great quality and perfect to travel with. I use them in my travel makeup bag because they are tiny and don&#x27;t take up a lot of space like standard size brushes although the brush heads are the perfect size. I use the tiny tapered brush for undereye concealer, the angled brush for blush, the fuller tapered brush for contouring my cheeks and the flat head brush for blending my makeup out. Excellent brushes, very soft and exactly what I needed for my daily travel makeup bag!</li>
    <li> I have had these mini baby bukis for almost two years now and I have been using them if not on daily, then almost 4 days out of 7!! The quality if amazing, the bristles are very soft and the amount of product they pick up is just right! Super easy to work with, blend well. I understand these are mini brushes and for the size their brushes are not tiny I just wish again the handles were a bit..um...thicker?? Overall though this is a GREAT travel set and I always take it on trips with me when I don&#x27;t wanna carry the entire brush set</li>
    <li> Love this small compact brushes. Soft brissels. And fit anywhere!</li>
    <li> wonderful brush set! love that it is eco friendly</li>
    <li> Great size for using loose powder foundation.</li>
    <li> These brushes work 10x better than any other I have purchased, including much more expensive makeup brushes.  If you&#x27;ve ever used the utterly useless Bare Minerals brushes you can appreciate how annoying multiple bristles falling out and getting into your eyes can be.  The bristles on the ecoTools stay put, are soft and non-aggravating, and do their job.</li>
    <li> Je les adore ! Ils sont tous petits (donc pas pratique pour maquiller une autre personne) mais trés bien pour se maquiller et leur forme sont vraiment trés bien pensée.</li>
    <li> GREAT SELLER...SUPER FAST SHIPPING...VERY SOFT BRUSHES...EXCELLENT QUALITY...LOVE THEM!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize these aren&#x27;t full size brushes and was a little disappointed about that.</li>
    <li> Great brushes!  Shipped fast!  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my niece, she loved it.</li>
    <li> The brushes feel wonderful on the skin and do the job of getting the product to the face!  My only improvement for them would be to have the intended use of each brush permanently marked on each handle.  Otherwise, in some applications, I have to reference the cardboard holding tray.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use all of these brushes regularly, but a couple of them are part of my every day routine! They are nice and soft and pretty good quality.</li>
    <li> Yes, these are small. I bought them for travel, though, so I expected/wanted that. The size makes them no less effective! They are wonderful. Soft without being thin. Love the buffer and bronzed (which I also use for blush). The concealer brush was a huge make up breakthrough for me. I have concealer brushes- all very small and flat. I had never seen a more fluffy one. What a difference! Love how it applies my concealer. So glad I made this purchase!</li>
    <li> i love ecotools!!! my most expensive brushes i own are the too faced teddy bear collection and the ecotools brushes are just as good, probably better. i love the designs, and how soft they are. these aren&#x27;t as packed as my kabuki that i had from one of there sets,but they work. they are very small, but i think that works better than a bigger brushes because these let you be more precise. it might take longer but detail is important when it comes to makeup application.</li>
    <li> THESE BRUSHES HAVE NO HANDLES!!!! I hope I can save someone else because obviously I overlooked that part. But unless you have an enormous head they still work fine. I love this brand of makeup brushes. They are very soft and they stay that way even after washing. This is my second time ordering brushes from this company (different set) and I am hooked.</li>
    <li> This brush set is discontinued from ecotools and I&#x27;ve been looking for it forever, since so many people have told me about it,  I absolutely love it! Great quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, I&#x27;ve had them for a year now and they&#x27;re been travelling with me and aren&#x27;t damaged at all. I&#x27;ve either been really good with cleaning them weekly or not... and they&#x27;ve held up very well.  If you&#x27;re considering buying this because you need a kabuki set, you&#x27;re getting into makeup and want good brushes, OR you don&#x27;t want to buy the set (that&#x27;s literally the same as this) that&#x27;s a higher end brand. I&#x27;ve used these with pressed and loose powder. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and the perfect size. I had no loose hairs in any of the brushes. They arrived quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of reviews that said these are really small, and they are, but I don&#x27;t think this should be a surprise. They look small in the picture and they were the exact size I assumed they would be. The handle is short and fat so it&#x27;s easy to hold. The bristle heads are full so it was just as easy to apply make up with them as it was any other kabuki brush. I bought these to use for my mineral powder and they&#x27;re perfect. They blend really nicely and you don&#x27;t get those irritating bristle hairs stuck to your face. ecoTOOLS by far makes the best brushes. The only thing that I think would be nice is if thse came with a little carrying case of some sort.</li>
    <li> This is my second set of eco tools brushes.  I bought this set for a new Bare Minerals make up set I got.  The brushes work beautifully.  No loose hairs falling out, they wash up easy and hold their shape.  For the price these are the best!</li>
    <li> These brushes are suburb.  The instructions for using each one is very clear and they follow up with you in the event you have any questions.  I never had such a great makeup job and received so many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They really are the BEST!</li>
    <li> I prefer my EcoTools brushes over another brand that I spent much more money on.  They are soft but sturdy.  They do a great job, don&#x27;t take up much space in my suitcase and are so easy to clean.  Of course, the price is the real bonus.  I suggested these to my daughter.</li>
    <li> Sof, nice feeling bristles.  VERY short handles, no more than a nub. Good but nothing to write home about.</li>
    <li> OK brush but very small for applying foundation. Recommend going with a larger brush for that purpose.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, I just wish they had the same set with longer handles! This set has lasted longer and gone through more washing without any strays than the set I paid $100 for. Plus, every time I&#x27;ve done my makeup in front of a friend, they all comment on how cute and nice they are.</li>
    <li> Their products last a long time. Always worth the money. Their brushes are also soft and remain soft after washing.</li>
    <li> I wish they were just a lil bigger. And one of the brushes a chunk of bristles came out b4 I even used it.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect for traveling or using everyday. So soft. Last a long time. Ive used them for over two years and they&#x27;re just as soft as the day I opened the package.</li>
    <li> ecoTools is a worthy brand, and these brushes prove it. I purchased this set because of the buff brush(I have a love for flat top brushes). With this entire set costing what one brush would cost from one of it&#x27;s major competitors, it was a no brain er. I&#x27;m happy. I use the buff brush to apply liquid foundation. In the future I will also try it with buffing. The bronze brush, I use for blush or contouring, the concealer brush, I don&#x27;t use yet. The contour brush I use for applying powder under my eyes. I have no negative thoughts on these brushes. They delivered!</li>
    <li> All of these are very soft. I&#x27;m a professional MUA, and I don&#x27;t use these a lot because I miss the handles, but there have been times I&#x27;ve been really glad to have them - and for this price? It&#x27;s a no-brainer.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel, too.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes because they are very soft and good quality. I use the buffing brush the most, it really helps smooth my powder foundation.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes!! These last forever and don&#x27;t have that awful chemical smell that most &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; brushes tend to have. The pouch is adorable too! I used to waste so much money on &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; brushes.. never again. These are just as good, last just as long, and you get so much more bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> This set is very handi since they are tiny brushes that can travel well........also well marked on box of what brushes is to be used on what part of the face, I like that but once out of the box you wouldn&#x27;t know.  I think you would have to mark the brushes so you would know what brush is for what............that&#x27;s not a problem but a concern of how it will work.  So I would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Cute set, saves a lot of room in my bag...so I can bring more brushes! Hard to use these as everyday brushes since they wont fit in my make up holder on my counter. I would recommend this to friends</li>
    <li> My favorites! They are very soft and last for a long time.</li>
    <li> They are small but a good size small. Great for traveling instead of taking all your big brushes unless they r your favorites :). Easy to use and apply make up.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes because they don&#x27;t take up too much space when I am travelling and have all the right shapes I needed.</li>
    <li> Great price and great value!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are very soft and comfortable, and they aren&#x27;t like any of those cheap mineral powder brushes with hairs falling over everywhere...&lt;br /&gt;This is great! And I love how colorful they are as well :)</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re decent brushes.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my bare minerals kabuki brushes as those are pretty costly however these aren&#x27;t as good of quality.  They don&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; and distribute makeup as evenly.  They&#x27;re not bad if you can&#x27;t afford the better ones.</li>
    <li> I like this brush set. They actually work better than some of the other make-up brush sets I&#x27;ve had. You can wash them and they don&#x27;t mess up or come apart.</li>
    <li> Received this item on time and the price was good. Great set of brushes. I like the compact style, takes up less room. Good for traveling or toting in your purse. Very soft brushes, not scratchy.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed. I&#x27;ve only used the buffing one so far, but huge chunks of bristles have come out after about 5 uses. I had bristles all over my face. Big mess. I was intrigued by the good reviews, but I&#x27;ll just go back to paying a bit more for Sigma. They last forever.</li>
    <li> Excellt set for blending when highlighting and countouring, The brishes were a little smaller than expected but are easy to manuever and are very compact which works for travel.</li>
    <li> Huge fan of ecoTools. Another great product.  I love that this offers a variety of brushes in a Kabuki Set. Well made for the price!!! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent, particularly for the price.  Very soft, and provide great coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the large one to apply loose powder and it applies so well and evenly that I use less powder.  I have seen comparable brushes in fine stores for over $60.00, and I can&#x27;t imagine them being any better.  And the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> The brushes are all very soft, feel wonderful on the skin, and seem well constructed - I have not had any shedding at all.  The set includes a nice variety of useful brushes and I prefer kabukis b/c I think they provide better control.  Don&#x27;t worry if you&#x27;re not sure what each brush is for, they included directions on the back of the package.  Here&#x27;s my assessment of each:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;conceal\\&quot; brush is wonderful. It&#x27;s the perfect size and shape for my face, which is petite so I do not like over sized brushes.  It&#x27;s very soft (feels great), yet densly bristled, so it works very well for blending and covering with mineral or liquid foundation or concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  \\&quot;contouring\\&quot; brush is slightly larger than the conceal brush and similar in shape, but it&#x27;s softer, i.e. not as densely bristled. I&#x27;ve been using it for blush and think it does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;buff\\&quot; brush is a good size and shape, but it&#x27;s too soft in my opinion.  I don&#x27;t think the bristles are dense enough for heavier make up application, so I use it for finishing powder, light blending, or brushing eyeshadow off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the angled \\&quot;bronzer\\&quot; brush is very soft but I would&#x27;ve liked it to be firmer.  It is a nice large size though and good for covering a large area when bronzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall I am very happy with the set. I expect the brushes will last a long time b/c I have other Ecotools brushes which have lasted for years, kept their shape, and did not shed.  It was a great price and each brush is a worthy addition to my cosmetic tools.  As an added bonus, these are really cute kabukis b/c Ecotools added pretty little designs to each handle.  Last but not least, the brushes are cruelty free!</li>
    <li> This are a really good brushes, very soft and cute size... the print is so sweet and I think for the price are very nice product</li>
    <li> brushes too big to contour with</li>
    <li> I just love how soft the brushes are but one of the handles got lose after some time. These are great to pack for traveling since the handles are short.  The slanted brush, which is supposed to be for contouring, is a bit soft</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of these. They don&#x27;t blend well</li>
    <li> I loved this kabuki brush set that i purchase months ago. the design were actually nice that looks like a bamboo to me. the brush were all silky soft and so nice to use in the skin face. i love the big brush the most to use for my blush on and powder brush after putting foundation. i can say it really helps me to be pretty somehow ^^</li>
    <li> This is probably my fault not the sellers but I expected theses brushes to be actual brushes not just the tops with stubby handles. But they are very soft and I haven&#x27;t noticed shedding yet. I&#x27;m not to disappointed tho because their only like 12 bucks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m something of a makeup snob, and am always looking for the next best thing to try out.  I bought these little brushes on a whim, and I absolutely LOVE them.  They&#x27;re perfect for everyday use, don&#x27;t shed, and wash well with mild shampoo.  Buy them!</li>
    <li> This brushes are small and compact, and fit in my purse perfectly.  They pick up a lot of makeup. I use the concealer breathe most.</li>
    <li> I like theses brushes so much I gave them as gifts and purchased four packs for myself. they are better than good and fit well in my small makeup bag that I carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> This product was bought for my daughter who is into fashion and makeup. She is very picky about her brushes and she loved these. They are a bit small to me but she said they are great!. VERY soft.</li>
    <li> I love this set. Coming from super cheap, ill constructed brushes, these little guys are fabulous. I find it easy to apply and blend foundation, blush, contouring powder, and powder. In my experience, they work well with both liquids or powders. They are soft to the touch. My only criticism is that I wish the handles were just a little longer.</li>
    <li> so..... i use them every day, my favourite is the buffing brush which i use for my foundation......the only thing that was a little displeasing was the size, but hey, at least they make good travelling brushes....apart from the size, they&#x27;re great</li>
    <li> The brushes are AMAZING! Very soft, just wish they were a little bigger, but i can work with that. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These are the only kind of make up brushes I use now. They&#x27;re travel size and so soft on my skin. If I take really good care of them, I don&#x27;t have to replace it very often. The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a travel size bag; however, I bought one with a different eco tools purchase and it fits well! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> These little brushes are wonderful.  You don&#x27;t need a big long stick to apply makeup well.  You need great bristles and these are fabulous.  So incredibly soft and thick.  And those shapes are very useful.  I love using them.  I thought I might like one and maybe I&#x27;d share them with a friend.  No way.  I use them all.  I guess a long stick might make them easier to store, but I have a drawer in my bathroom so it&#x27;s no big deal for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try them.  Seriously.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
    <li> This brush set is soft and easy to handle.  I decided to share a couple with my sixteen year old granddaughter and she is loving them.</li>
    <li> I bought these for applying Bare Minerals for modeling, and they work perfectly. Plush, easy to handle, exactly as described, and a great deal!</li>
    <li> Cool different size brushes, for blush, for every parts of making your makeup blend beautifully.  One brush also for illumination, and it looks great!!!!</li>
    <li> Sister loves this, thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes.  They are very soft and the bristles do not shed.  Please note that they are as they appear and they have short handles.  I did not realize this when I ordered them, but turns out I like them better with the shorter handles.</li>
    <li> These are fabulous brushes at any price, but at this piece point, they&#x27;re simply incredible.  I.use the contour brush with my bronzer for contouring, the concealer brush works perfectly with my highlighter, and the bronzer and buff brushes can be used for multiple purposes. These are wonderfully soft and  nicely dense. They are worth more than twice the price. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soooooo soft! The small size gives me the travel-freedom of light weight plus of course space saving and the small handles give me the perfect grip for usage on my face. These do not shed at all, are cruelty free, eco-friendly. Plus they are super cute-looking with nice designs on them. I just had one issue that while the pack these came in are very useful for storage, the slot for each brush cudve been a tad more wider, I had to literally wrestle to get them out :P . Other than that, great great brushes!</li>
    <li> Love these little guys!  They are so comfortable in your hand as opposed to a big brush handle!  They work your powder into all the contours of your face and they are soooo soft.  And they are so small you can fit ALL of them in your make up bag when traveling.</li>
    <li> So soft! and so reasonable on price! Great for beginners or a make up artist. My first time getting eco tool, will be buying again .</li>
    <li> I use the \\&quot;Bronze\\&quot; and \\&quot;Buff\\&quot; brushes from this set every day to apply my CC cream, liquid foundation and blush.  I especially love how the \\&quot;Bronze\\&quot; brush is shaped, it makes it perfect for blush/bronzer.  I&#x27;ve washed these brushes many times, and have never once had a fiber fall out.  They&#x27;re built strong, and they are really soft and nice on the skin.  Definitely recommend these!</li>
    <li> The softest makup brushes I ever had! Also, most im faportantly is great for foundation application. Plus, organic...I highly recommend. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> i should have gotten the one with longer handles, the bristles are very smooth tho</li>
    <li> I love this whole set. The brushes are very high quality and wash well in mild soap and cool water. The bronzer brush is perfect for blush. In general, I love ecoTools brushes because they work really well, are cruelty-free and are easy to clean. Best brushes on the market in my opinion.</li>
    <li> These are great, I love them not only for travel but every day use. They have very soft bristles.</li>
    <li> These are very tiny and great for make up case in your purse.  I would not purchase these for your daily makeup use.</li>
    <li> Good price, good product.  I was leary, but tired of washing other brushes.  These are luxurious but inexpensive enough to toss if I want instead of washing.</li>
    <li> When I first ordered I didnt realize the brushes where short but I love them. Great product. I do wish the powder brush was larger though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for over 2 months now and they work perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are space saver in a makeup bag. However you do need to keep in mind, they do take up a different kind of space and sometimes it may require a specific compartment to store them.</li>
    <li> I like this brushes..use them when i travel.</li>
    <li> Love the size I&#x27;m so use to them I don&#x27;t like to use my regular brushes anymore unless I have to!</li>
    <li> This EcoTOOLS make-up Kabuki brush kit.. came 3 business days after I placed the order! Brand new and in great condition. Couldn&#x27;t be any more pleased. Great quality product too, have been using  EcoTools for years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I don&#x27;t reach of them often.</li>
    <li> So soft and smooth, but still gets the right job done for each brush. I like the short handle style especially for the foundation brush. I have used these every day since I purchased them and not 1 bristle has come out yet.</li>
    <li> i really like how soft they are. i use them very often and they work perfectly al thought they are small but what gives i still like them!!</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the brand. i made a good choice.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes that do a good job applying blush or bronzer. Nothing special, but they get the job done.</li>
    <li> Sturdy kabuki brushes with dense soft bristles. I use them everyday for applying foundation, contouring, blush and blending. Perfect set for me. Great price too. I&#x27;m tempted to buy another set for travel.</li>
    <li> Great quality. This is really a good purchase. The price and quality.... both great. They are tiny so it is perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! I use them to apply my mineral makeup now instead of the brushes that came with it.</li>
    <li> Even though they may seem kind of short, that are really perfect!!! I love these so much, the quality should not be depicted by the price... I would recommend this to anybody!</li>
    <li> most of the product stayed on the brushes and they fell apart after only a few uses. not good for heavy use</li>
    <li> These are my favorite brushes. Love them.</li>
    <li> I have purchased eco tools before from retail/drug stores before. These did not let me down. They are soft, thick and hold make-up well. For the price you can&#x27;t do much better.</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredibly GREAT quality for the price.  The brissles are so soft and work very well.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  The only thing is that they are short and don&#x27;t have a long shaft which I assumed from the picture and was fine with.  Make it a bit more challenging, BUT fits better in my makeup case!!  Would order again and plan to order more from this brand!</li>
    <li> Very nice and good value. Would buy this brand again.</li>
    <li> The brushes are really soft and cute. On the packaging it tells you what each of the brushes do. If you are a type of person who needs to have a constant reminder for a well to get familiar with each brushes purpose i would you suggest  you label them when you get them becasue its not on the product itself.</li>
    <li> And I&#x27;m still using them. They don&#x27;t lose bristles, like I&#x27;ve experienced for many of the $30+ brushes, and remain soft for a long period of time. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
    <li> I bought these a while ago and I just love them to death.They are super soft.They wash really well and most importantly they do not shed. I have a ton of MAC brushes but somehow I keep reaching for these over and over again. These are also great for traveling or just throwing them in your makeup bag.</li>
    <li> Too soft and yielding, sparse bristles, low quality</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft and applies makeup well. I use these brushes mainly for contouring and buffing to even out concealer and foundation. The handle could be longer but I can&#x27;t complain because I picked these for its short handle.</li>
    <li> I am very very happy with the purchase, it really was what I expected :) amazing, pretty, very good quality!!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift, but she didn&#x27;t ask me to burn it or return it, so it must be okay.</li>
    <li> These brushes are sooooooo soft!!!!! I love them! They don&#x27;t hold very much makeup on the brush compared to some other brands. However if you like the natural look, these are the brushes for you. Very soft, quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Well each daughter stole one but the two I was left with, I adore! Well-made, no hairs fall out. Soft bristled and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> These brushes are so cute, so soft, and so appealing. They are small, decorative, and the bristles are cruelty-free. So far, they seem to work great. They are color-coded on their aluminum handles. The packaging says the pink is for use with liquid foundation (I haven&#x27;t tried that yet), the blue is for applying bronzer, the green is for applying blush, and the brown is to smooth over the face to remove excess powder. This set would be a charming gift for anyone who uses makeup brushes. Of course, you will have to buy a set for yourself because once you see it, you WILL want a set of your own.</li>
    <li> These brushes are cute and handy. They stay soft and never shed. Perfect for traveling and touch ups for the face. These are amazing for their size.</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes BUT be aware they are tiny!  From the pictures you might think you are getting full size or least 1/2 size brushes...no you are not...these are very small..more like miniture brushes.  I don&#x27;t think they will last long..but on the plus side...they might be good for travel because they won&#x27;t take up much room in your make-up case.</li>
    <li> Very good brushes. Soft bristles but condensed enough that you can contour flawlessly. Love them!</li>
    <li> They feel good but seem very cheap. One of the bottoms fell off the first day I used them. They&#x27;re just ok</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to like these brushes this much, I just wanted brushes that would fit in a little makeup case that I had recently purchased. However after trying these out, im in love with them. They are the softest makeup brushes ive ever used, and i especially like the concealer brush. Another good thing about these brushes is that they dont seem to hold on to residue very much at all, so they require less cleaning.</li>
    <li> I love that they don&#x27;t take up too much space in my make up bag. I am happy with my purchase. The quality is ok and I don&#x27;t have loose brush bristles on my face when I&#x27;m done putting on my make up. I would recommend these. The price is great and quality is pretty good.</li>
    <li> These definitely are not the best quality brushes that I have, but for the price...they&#x27;re great. They should last me a couple years. The one has a spot on it where the hairs are falling out but it&#x27;s not a big deal. They are really easy to hold and use. No regrets about the purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this brush set! Perfect for traveling and they are so soft! Been looking for new makeup brushes and this pack came with the exact brushes I was looking for! Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> All four of these are brushes are soft and easy to work with. They give you a lot of control and each brush shape is really handy. EcoTools never disappoints.</li>
    <li> I have used another brand Kabuki brush to apply mineral make-up and have replaced them a couple of times. I find these brushes to work even better and I am very pleased with the results. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this set especially for my everyday make up bag as my regular brushes take up so much room! It is perfect and just as described.These brushes are soft, small and good quality although I do wish the &#x27;buff&#x27; one was more dense. The &#x27;conceal&#x27; one however couldn&#x27;t be more perfect for doing under eye concealer. Genuinely makes it worth it for this brush alone.</li>
    <li> These brushes are perfect!  They&#x27;re so soft and the bristles don&#x27;t fall out!  They&#x27;re a little bit smaller then I thought they were but That&#x27;s not a big deal at all.  I will definitely buy more eco tools brushes</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve guessed that the handles were plastic but they are a sturdy aluminum. I would&#x27;ve guessed the bristles were plastic-y but they are soft as animal fur.</li>
    <li> I always love ecotools products but I love the design on these. I can use these for everything I want to do and the brussels are so soft. I will keep on buying these products.</li>
    <li> Brush are good, i just expect them to be bigger.</li>
    <li> really cute and work well</li>
    <li> I purchased this Kabuki Brush set as a gift.  My friend has raved about the quality ever since.  She loves the weight, the shape, the hand feel and the density of the brushes.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these kabukis from ecotools! They blend so well and are so soft and cute! Love the packaging! I suggest buying these kabukis if you need some!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised how much I like these brushes.  I don&#x27;t miss the handles at all and it&#x27;s especially nice when you travel having that extra space...but even when you don&#x27;t.  These are the tools for making you skin look awesome.  I use the blush and stippling brushes the most.</li>
    <li> I love Ecotools, but this is not the greatest. I am using these in my gym bag, but I would never use them as my everyday brushes. The handles are too short and a bit awkward, but they are perfect for taking with you because they are so small. Brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
    <li> These are wonderfully soft and well made.  Love the short handles that are easy to use and store in a makeup kit.  Also love that they&#x27;re easy on the environment.</li>
    <li> The flat top is best used with powder make up as it seems to take much longer for it to smoothly blend in liquid makeup. The contour and blush brushes serve their purpose well.</li>
    <li> ALL of my brushes are ecoTOOLS ONLY I but mine at Ulta but have never seen one this size. Perfect for travel. Great quality for an even better price. MUST HAVE!!!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes, they are easy to use and hold and are super soft. I clean them with baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great brushes at a great price. Really good for travel, as they are nice and small. Love them very much</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best ... Super soft  and no shedding at all ... Great buy the price does not reflect  the quality</li>
    <li> I love ecotools brushes, all their products are soft to the touch and easy to clean and maintain. I was very excited when I came across this set and ordered it right away. My favorite of the set is by far the &amp;#34;buff&amp;#34; brush which makes it very easy to apply just my BB powder on work days and even out powder over my liquid foundation on date nights. Also the concealer brush is wonderful for blending out liquids as it is very dense. I am not so pleased with the angled bronzer brush, for me it is to wide and makes precision application very difficult. Same goes for the contour brush, just not dense enough in my opinion but I do use the contour brush more for applying my bronzer then I use the angled brush. I was wary of the very short handles at first but they actually make it very easy to control precisely where you want to apply/buff/blend. This set is a great addition to my ecotools collection and I look forward to using 3 of the 4 brushes regularly in my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> I own several Japonesque brushes, but found that the bristles on those seem to absorb my liquid makeup and clump as well. Not only that, but the handles are extremely bulky and difficult to store for travel, and one brush goes for $20 minimum.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are literally 5x better, and I got four for HALF the price of one Japonesque brush! My face is thanking me, and so is my wallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Concealer brush is the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s like a finger, but with soft tapered bristles- I just dip the brush into my MAC Creme Concealer pot, and dab it in a circular motion on my problem areas- it covers and blends at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t use a bronzer, so I had no use for the Bronzer brush. It is the biggest brush in the set, however, and has a nice taper and firm core.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Contour brush applies my blush evenly and blends with no issues. It could be a bit firmer, but for the price there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m complaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The Buff brush does an exceptional job with dispersing my finishing powder and lightly blending/buffing the whole area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short handles take a little getting used to, but they&#x27;re completely worth the amount of space they save me. All I need now is a good stippling brush for my liquid BB cream, and I&#x27;ll be good to go!&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> This are some amazing brushes . They are so soft to the touch and on your face . My skin is so sensitive and this brushes just glide on the make -up and their Eco friendly</li>
    <li> Great makeup brushes I use them everyday great price nice package awesome metal handle all around great buy thank you</li>
    <li> These are great little tools for blending makeup. They fit in my hand so perfectly and I have better control of thier use.</li>
    <li> I thought these were full sized but they are mini. They don&#x27;t shed and make me look so pretty. My makeup goes on even and they are easy to clean. I really love them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these brushes for years. They work great and are surprisingly good quality.</li>
    <li> Brushes are too small</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. They are very easy to handle, don&#x27;t shed all over the place, and are cheap!</li>
    <li> Brushes are good quality and I love that the handles are short and stubby. Makes it so much easier for traveling.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it. :) It is quite a cheap option but it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> I love the brushes, it&#x27;s so smooth, good in my face, that&#x27;s why will order more in the future. Thanks.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a perfect kabuki brush set that is affordable and convenient on the go...you have found the one for you!  These brushes are soft and of great quality.  I love that they are small enough to throw into a make up bag without worrying about trying to fit the handles in.  The concealer brush so far is my favorite.  It glides my makeup on flawlessly and without any harsh lines.  Anyone who needs a diverse set of brushes to help with the many steps it sometimes takes to perfect flawed skin...this is definitely the set for you!</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughter as a gift.  She loves them.</li>
    <li> These little guys do the trick. They are inexpensive and do just as good of a job as bigger and higher end brushes do</li>
    <li> these spread out the product very well, honestly it works as well as high end brand brushes, will buy more</li>
    <li> I love all the ecotools makeup brushes, and the same is to be said for these.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re great and so cute! Definitely recommend! &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Instead of buying sets or professional brushes that cost freakin 29 $, which is crazy.&lt;br /&gt;You can buy these Mini Kabuki brushes, and they do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great.&lt;br /&gt;Not huge and long.&lt;br /&gt;Just buy them. You will use them everyday.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was expecting them to be bigger but I actually prefer them the size they are, to be honest. I find they&#x27;re great for precise contouring, applying blush and getting in the little spaces around your eyes &amp; nose. They&#x27;re soft, feel like great quality and are very reasonably priced. I highly recommend adding these to your brush collection.</li>
    <li> Does wonders blending my make-up. It&#x27;s great. And it&#x27;s small enough that I don&#x27;t have to carry my big brush set when I travel.</li>
    <li> I really like the shape of the brushes and the quality.I somehow wish the stick was a little longer but not that it&#x27;s a problem to hold. Good buy for basic everyday brushes ;)</li>
    <li> very good Amazon! I love this article!</li>
    <li> the brushes are so soft. I didn&#x27;t realize that they are mini brushes however.</li>
    <li> Four great brushes at an even greater price!  Good for contouring, blush and foundation.  I washed and completely dried all the brushes before using.  There was no shedding.  The short handle is easy to use and store.  The patterns are fun and make me happy.  I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> These brushes are excellent at getting the job done, especially for only being $10! Great brushes at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> These kabuki brushes are the best ones that i have ever owned. they are so soft i love them. they are also small so you can travel with them or bring them with you on the go.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used ecotools brushes for years and they are the best brushes for your budget. I don&#x27;t get any shedding, they are sooooo soft and they apply my makeup well.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re a fan of makeup brushes, you&#x27;ll love these to take w/you on your next trip, or even in your purse&#x27;s makeup bag. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> The bristles dont fall out and they stay in good shape. I love these makeup brushes and use them everyday!</li>
    <li> I am not a sophisticated make-up user. Everything I know, I have had to piece together from friends and (finally) youtube in my adult life. I like these brushes, but I don&#x27;t know what makes expensive brushes expensive so consider the source. These are soft and do the job ... I have washed them and they hold up well.</li>
    <li> The brushes are very good quality and easy to handle.  However, it would have been ideal to include some kind of case to hold the brushes in to keep them clean and accessible.</li>
    <li> The brushes are good and I enjoy using it but it could use alil length to them. other then that, I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> Honestly. the brush is damn soft. I bought for my girlfriends and they love it! Recommended! 5 stars for the review!</li>
    <li> i travel quite a bit so i needed some short brushes to fit in a small bag which these do. well made the bristles don&#x27;t come off while I&#x27;m using it.</li>
    <li> I use this set every single day! My favorite brush is the contour brush, which I use to bronze up my face. I use the angled one for blush and sometimes use the flat top one for powder. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> super cute nd super soft</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes as soon as I moved from just doing eye makeup to all-over-face makeup.  This really is a great starter kabuki brush set for those just getting into makeup.  EcoTools makes quality, cruelty-free brushes for fantastic prices.  These are sort of mini kabukis, but the size doesn&#x27;t take away from their quality.  I almost like the smaller ones better than the full size ones.  You can really get some detail work done with them.  I will describe the brushes you get in this set:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concealer brush:  This brush is great for foundation and concealer.  It is very dense, but soft.  It has a shape similar to a very large finger, so it makes applying concealer and foundation very easy.  This brush blends in the creams very smoothly and without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blush brush:  This is very soft and not dense.  This brush is angled, making applying blushes very easy.  The blush goes on smoothly.  This brush could also be used for applying bronzer along the cheekbone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contour brush:  This brush is very soft, and has a medium density.  It is very round, making it perfect for applying the dark contour shade on the forehead, under the cheekbones, and under the chin and neck.  This is my favorite brush out of the four.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffer brush:  This brush is very soft with low density.  It is perfect for knocking that excess setting powder off of your face, or blending in contouring powder for a soft, natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my favorite thing is, though unconventional, are the decorative ferrules.  They have such beautiful designs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  I use these kabuki brushes in my daily makeup routine.  They are fabulous!  I would highly recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I am not a make up expert, but these brushes are hands down the best I&#x27;ve tried. They did not irritate my sensitive skin and I likes the variety of the brushes so I can use them for concealer, foundation, blush, and setting powder.</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size for travel. They work really well and seem to be high quality.</li>
    <li> I was so amazed by these brushes. I have most of the Eco tools  brushes but I didn&#x27;t have these. They work so nicely and blend great. It came even quicker then I expected. So amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> These brushes have exceeded my highest expectations!  The Concealer brush alone is worth the asking price.  These brushes have changed my morning makeup routine for the better and my makeup has never appeared so blended and flawless.  If you are on the fence like I was, just order them.  You will be glad you did!</li>
    <li> I love these brushes. bought for my daughter, too)) easy-to-trave</li>
    <li> I have only used the bronzer brush but it doesn&#x27;t shed on skin like other brushes. Love it, definitely buy</li>
    <li> These brushes are extremely cheap and I would not reccomend them for everyday use; however, they are very soft. aaa</li>
    <li> I wanted brushes that fit in makeup bag easily.  These do!  Perfect set for contouring, blending etc.  They also fit well in my carousel stand I have my makeup organized in on my counter.  Easy to grab and use.  The hair doesn&#x27;t flake off on your face, and they seem well made.</li>
    <li> Good, quality brushes.</li>
    <li> Seem pretty well put together, i like the alot.</li>
    <li> i use these as my everyday application brushes because they are small and don&#x27;t clutter my makeup drawer</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes &amp; they blend very well! However I dis not know the handles we&#x27;re so tiny!</li>
    <li> I ordered these brushes back in March and two of them have completely fallen apart since then. I originally liked the compact size of these and the softness. The bronzer brush was actually my favorite of the four, it is built great for using powders over the cheek area. I rinse my brushes with 95% alcohol and rinse them with water every two weeks to clean them. When the buffing brush started shedding, I pulled at a few loose hairs, thinking it was only one or two, but the shedding didn&#x27;t stop and about half of the hairs completely fell out of the handle. I thought maybe I was cleaning them wrong and contacted the company for advice. NO REPLY. About another month passed before the same thing happened to the bronzer brush. I contacted the company again to complain and left a review on their site that was never posted. Now I&#x27;m leaving a review here. I read the reviews here before purchasing and it seemed like this isn&#x27;t a typical problem with these brushes. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find out I just got a bad batch, but seeing as how THERE IS NO HELPFUL CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM THIS COMPANY, I have no way of knowing and I&#x27;ve since stopped buying ecoTOOLS.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much the quality of brushes make such a difference in makeup application!  These are great for me!!</li>
    <li> This Eco tools brush set is so soft it makes all the products I have easy to apply on the face!!</li>
    <li> These brushes are great &amp; very inexpensive. I have purchased brushes for up to $30.00 each in the past&lt;br /&gt;that weren&#x27;t half as good as these. I highly recommend these brushes. Try them and you will be happy you did.&lt;br /&gt;They do not shed as many of the expensive ones do.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes! SO SOFT. So cute! Would definitely buy again! I just love the Eco Tools brand. Best brushes I&#x27;ve tried. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I guess I was naive by the looks of the packaging because these brushes are tiny! But, I love them.  They work as they&#x27;re supposed to and they are very very soft! I use the flat top brush to apply foundation. I use the slanted  brush to apply powder and the tip brushes for concealer under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Love these little guys. I mostly use them for contouring and blending but if I need to take some brushes on a trip these are my go to</li>
    <li> i like them, but now i realize i dont need too many brushs for blush, so i use one or two of them, if you are a girl that uses a lot of different brushes for make up then they are a good choice</li>
    <li> Great little tools of the trade. They&#x27;re very soft and have perfect shapes. At first I thought &amp;#34;why so many?&amp;#34; but now I know.</li>
    <li> The buffing and bronzing brushes aren&#x27;t as dense as I might like. But otherwise they are fine. They aren&#x27;t as small as I was expecting seeing some of the other reviews. Good size, very soft, no shedding. The only downside is trying to store them so they keep their shape.</li>
    <li> This is a great value in a small package! The brushes are small but totally awesome! I really enjoyed to apply my foundation with this brush, and I usually don&#x27;t like applying foundation with a brush and prefer a beauty blender type of sponge. But this brush set has been great to apply makeup! I really like them a lot and recommend.</li>
    <li> Nice brushes. The short handles make them easy to handle and angle.  They do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> Not the brushes I expected.</li>
    <li> This brush set seems to be well made. They are quite soft and a compact size. Good price and good for traveling.</li>
    <li> great product high quality and very soft</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, but find myself using it everyday.  It&#x27;s really nicely designed.  I use the small brush to apply BB cream.  The wider ones for highlighter and blush and the tapered one for contouring powder.  Perfect</li>
    <li> love this set. it even tells you which brush goes for which beauty regime. I just wish it said it on the actual brush stem, because since I&#x27;ve thrown the box away, I always forget.</li>
    <li> I like my new brushes,  they are small but I can do all I want with them, for the good price!</li>
    <li> This is a nice set of brushes. Like most ecoTools they are soft, and very flexibility. They are well made, and even with daily use and frequent washings no bristles have fallen out. The handles are metal with a nice floral design. These work very well.</li>
    <li> Great brushes! thank you</li>
    <li> I love the EcoTools brushes! I already had several from their brand. The price is great, and I feel better with the whole &amp;#34;going green&amp;#34; crap. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly bought this just for the flat-top kabuki brush, and it&#x27;s perfect. I have the other three and use them occasionally, but I would have totally bought a multi-pack of four flat-top kabukis. :P Even for just the one brush, this was the best price, and the quality is great. I use the brush for my liquid foundation and setting powder, and it would be great for applying bronzer for contouring.</li>
    <li> I liked them especially the buff  brush . They are soft and its hair didn&#x27;t fall like other brushes I tried .</li>
    <li> Love em!!!  Will order some more for perfect christmas gift.  Delivery in timely manner.  Will recommend to friends &amp; relatives.</li>
    <li> I love my brushes :) Very soft and can fit anywhere. I wish it came with a case.</li>
    <li> Handles are a little short, but a great value!</li>
    <li> Very handy. Great quality and perfect size to be carried on a purse! Love the ecoTOOLS line!</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM VERY GOOD QUALITY.</li>
    <li> Terrible brushes! I have used it for 2 days and one felt appart!</li>
    <li> I carry these in my purse. As I wrote in another review, I found this brand while looking up another and now I&#x27;m a fan. It&#x27;s so durable even through several washes. They have not shed in the last month or so I&#x27;ve been using them and always go back to it&#x27;s original texture after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I found this brand, I won&#x27;t have to use another and their extremely affordable, so I won&#x27;t have a nervous breakdown if I lost one.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Turlock my was a little awkward..not your fault ...the brushes were quite nice ..especially the contour.</li>
    <li> Feels smmoth on skin and great to use as applicator when applying foundation, and other makeup.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve been a long time &#x27;eco tools&#x27; user, haha. However, I was a bit hesitant to order this item since I&#x27;ve never seen the kabuki set before but it&#x27;s eco tools...how bad could it be? Boy, I am so happy I ordered this set! I have a ton of brushes but I can already say these will be my new favorites. The bristles are very soft, the brushes pick up the right amount of product and blends very nicely. I also like the size, great for my face and hands - LOL, I&#x27;m rather petite and larger brushes tend to cover too much of my face. I would recommend to a friend for sure, which says a lot since I am an avid make up and tools collector. Oh and the brushes are perfect for travel as well.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, they are ok. They started falling apart from the handle, but the actuall brush is still good. Ive had them for a while now.</li>
    <li> The quality of the brushes is fine I just have no idea which one to use for doing makeup instruction sheet would be helpful.</li>
    <li> Wow these brushes are soft. They are a little small but it is no big deal it makes it even better for travel, they work really really really good. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t loose the hairs, which is great and is small enough to fit in my makeup pouch.</li>
    <li> Good soft brushes! wish they had accompanying pouch to put into.</li>
    <li> Wonderful brushes. They&#x27;re perfect for my face and I do have small hands so since they&#x27;re so small they are easy to handle. Wonderful brushes</li>
    <li> These are the perfect size, and make my makeup look amazing!  I use them with Sheer Cover, and it makes the makeup look flawless, unlike other brushes.</li>
    <li> Eco is a great brand ladies. A true must buy! Soft brushes and my makeup goes on smoothly. So I suggest trying these brushes.</li>
    <li> Omg these brushes are awesome. My friends love them how soft they are and how they distribute the makeup and powder so well.</li>
    <li> I use these everyday. Theyre actually bigger than what I expected, the handles are smally but the bristles actually have a pretty good diameter size. Theyre super soft and they havent shed a single hair. The one that I like the most is the contouring one, it&#x27;s freaking perfect. The concealer one has stiffer bristles but is still stop; it conceals really well and it blends exactly like your finger does, but without gettin your finger dirty. I dont always wear blush, when i do it blends in the color really well, and the buffer brush does the same with powder. It was a great buy! Totally recommend.</li>
    <li> I own many ectools products and this set is one of my favorites! Very convenient for traveling or even everyday use. The brushes are sooo soft!! No shedding, easy to clean, easy to store does take up much space at all. All around great product!</li>
    <li> Love them!!! One for blush ,highling, and blending. I just wish that they had longer handles but I adapted quickly to them within three uses. I no longer use my other brushes for the blush highlight or blending. BUT I MUST ADMIT I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT ANY MAC BRUSHES SO I CAN&#x27;T COMPARE THESE TO THEM</li>
    <li> Pros: Price, Perfect for travel, Compact, Effective&lt;br /&gt;Con: No travel case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall very happy with this purchase after the first month of use.</li>
    <li> I gave it a five star because there is not one thing I don&#x27;t like about it. Before I purchased the product I was skeptical about the quality of the hair. The hair feels natural and smooth. They also do not shed the hair. I also like the size because it is travel friendly. I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I never use these.  They&#x27;re just so small and so awkward in your hands.  Their regular sized brushes are awesome, but I would not recommend these.</li>
    <li> The outsides of all the handles fell off but not really an issue to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; brush quality is great- so soft</li>
    <li> These brushes are too cute!  The are small enough to be easy to take in a makeup bag, but do a big job. They are soft, and I love that they are as ecofriendly as all ecotools brushes.  This kabuki brush set is the latest addition to my ecotools collection, and I don&#x27;t have a brush from ecotools that I don&#x27;t love. They don&#x27;t shed, clean easily and inexpensive and have a brush for most uses.  These have adorable designs on the handles which pulled me in, but the quality held my loyalty.  The concealer brush is useful for under eye and especially by the nose.  The buffer blends well, but is also useful for foundation, both mineral and liquid, the bronzer is also good for blush, and the contour is a useful and hard to find shape.  I am still experimenting to find all of the uses I can.  I plan to buy another set for myself for my makup bag, so I can keep one at home, and will buy a set each for my daughter and daughter in law.  Love these.  It would be nice if they came with a bag, as many ecotools sets do, as I hate to crush them, but that is a small thing.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ecotools, its basically all I use on my face.  These little brushes and I do mean little they are small but a prefect fit for me.  They have solid handles and the brushes are the prefect density and are super soft.  I also received my brushes 3 days before the estimated delivery day which made me super happy! the packaging was a little beat up but that made it easier for me to get them out.</li>
    <li> I love his brush set. Very soft and great for contouring.</li>
    <li> I really like these little brushes.  The bristles are very sturdy and they feel very well made.  These has quickly become my favorite go to make up brushes</li>
    <li> the best brush set that i have ever had</li>
    <li> I like the pointed one. But the rest are too flimsy and hard to clean, and leave lines and streaks in your makeup. I recommend Real Techniques brushes or Shishiedo (spell check)</li>
    <li> These are really nice! I really like them overall. The are really soft! I have many of ecoTOOLS items and I love them all! Great buy!</li>
    <li> Great set!!! Very cute and small enough to take wherever you go.  Bristles are made very well and no shedding at all.</li>
    <li> LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS ON MY FACE!!! Use it every day and have not regret this product. No fall outs so far. I&#x27;ve been using it for about over a week. Also fast shipping. Awesome purchase!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005TKZS76 Eco Tools Limited Edition Beautiful Expressions Kabuki Set, 4 pc]]  All these makeup brushes perform as well as expected. There are similar brushes from more expensive brands, but these will do. Plus, they are portable. I tried the concealer brush (pointy one) for mineral makeup and powder foundation, and it works. The brushes blend your makeup beautifully, regarding of brand you use. I ordered my set at Drugstore.com, since my local stores were not selling them.</li>
    <li> Nice and small for travel bag. They do what I expected and the price wasn&#x27;t thay bad. Will recommend to others.</li>
    <li> these brushes are extremely soft &amp; work very well as good as or better the bare minerals brushes that are outrageously priced this is an awesome set</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re soft and of good quality. I&#x27;m happy that they&#x27;re cruelty free, and I hope that so was the packaging.</li>
    <li> They are cute for travelling, but I thought I was buying the larger brushes.  They are tiny, but&lt;br /&gt;work good and do not shed.  The hair on the brushes are soft and very good.  Recommend&lt;br /&gt;for travelling, but I needed the large brushes for home.</li>
    <li> At the same time i bough 3 different set of brushes, but this ones really are great to apply my fundation, powder and blush.... The short handler is actually good to avoid lines when applying fundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like them alot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cata</li>
    <li> I was actually looking for a larger brush and handle.  These brushes are smaller than I realized.  Work well for my young daughter.</li>
    <li> So beautifully soft. The brushes were of very good quality. The perfect for all round use.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described,came quickly..</li>
    <li> These are cute small brushes and for a while they were perfect for me.  Since the purchase I have purchased larger brushes in the same styles because holding these tiny brushes proves to be difficult/ annoying at times.  I didn&#x27;t notice any fallout or bristles, and I did clean them a few times so I feel certain that they are sturdy.</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad that I could say about this brush set.  I love the shapes, the sizes and the price.&lt;br /&gt;Extremely soft and durable, with once-a-week washing it doesn&#x27;t shed but every few months and when it does it&#x27;s like one hair.&lt;br /&gt;I use the slanted one for blush and it fits my cheek perfectly and blends my blush so well I don&#x27;t even remember what blush brush I was using before because this one is IT.  The flat top one is perfect for buffing, but I generally use it when I apply powder with a puff to sweep off excess.  I don&#x27;t use the conceal one at all, and the contour one is perfect for contouring with a powder.&lt;br /&gt;Such a great set, even if I use only 3 of 4, that I bought a back up set for when the ones I am using start to wear out.</li>
    <li> Ok so before I decided to get these I looked at several diffrent types. I have read good and bad reviews. But I decided what the heck they didn&#x27;t cost much so if they were not any good it would not be a huge waste of money!!! I got them when it said I would no problems with shipping. So let me just say these are amazing I love them. Yez tgey are small but if you pay attention and look at the picture you can see that. So if you don&#x27;t want small do not buy them. My order looked exactly like the picture nothing was diffrent. So what you see is what your buying. Anyway I have bought several diffrent types and brands of makeup brushes some cheaper some really expensive. So let me tell you these are my absolute favorite over any others I have used and tryed they are so soft i love the way they feel . They are also full and not thin i have learnt that the fullness of the brushes make a big diffrence when trying to do your make up.. I&#x27;m not an expert or one of tgem ppl that work for the company that go in and put false fake good reviews just to get ppl to buy there products. Believe it or not I see that alor and personally think its bullcrap that they are allowed to do that. I am just a stay at home mom that likes to put makeup on every once in a while when me and the hubby are going to town or on a date night or to look nice when I go to my sons school! Lol. So anyway if you want good full brushes and can&#x27;t afford all the hundred dollar sets that are out there. And again if you are looking for big brushes or longer handles then these are not that but I don&#x27;t find the smaller shorter size a problem at all. I hope this helps any one when wanting to purchase but not really sure like I was because of mixed reviews!!!!</li>
    <li> Soft and inexpensive! The cute small sizes fits perfectly in my makeup bag. Wishes they had some sort of cap for the brushes tho. Overall I love it and would recommend these brushes to all the beginner makeup users out there!</li>
    <li> I love them, love them, love them!  You can never go wrong with Eco Tools brushes ... they are at a great price point and out last some of the more expensive brands.  Thank you EcoTools!</li>
    <li> These brushes are super soft and are easy to clean. Application of cosmetics were a blast. Controll of pressure to skin is easy to keep track of.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous set of brushes!  Some reviews say they&#x27;re small but hello... it is a kabuki set!  Normal kabuki size in my opinion... perfect for travel.  They are super soft, they don&#x27;t shed &amp; obviously synthetic which is better for flawless foundation coverage, plus animal cruelty free!!!!  I love this set I am VERY happy I purchased them!</li>
    <li> These brushes are the best especially illy the foundation brush , no shedding even makeup application, and great quality, will purchase more</li>
    <li> These are just as wonderful as I had hoped.  I love the bristle textures and shapes. They are exactly the tools I needed.</li>
    <li> MY LITTLE BRUSHES ARE THE BEST FOR APPLYING ANY KIND OF MAKEUP.  THEY GLIDE THE MAKEUP ON PERFECTLY TO PERFECTION ..LOL.. A GREAT DEAL, I WILL GET MORE FOR NEXT SEASON.  NOT THAT I NEED TO , THEY WILL BE GOOD I&#x27;M SURE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.  THEY&#x27;RE SOFT, AND ARE AUTHENTIC NO BREAK OUTS. I WILL BUY FROM SELLER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> The assortment contains every brush you need.  Reasonable price.  Good quality.  Small size is easy to handle.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> They were too small and i ended up giving the set away to my niece for her dolls.  Not as impressed as some folks are</li>
    <li> item arrive on time however it was package poorly. the base which held the brushes was glued to side of box, so brushes were exposed and pinched by. sides.  brushes were dusty and I even found a blond hair in the box (ew) .  too much trouble to send back for exchange so I will just have to wash them prior to using.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft but very sturdy.  Great quality and coverage for face.  Having fun playing around with the different angles on brushes.  Very much worth their price.</li>
    <li> These are good brushes. The handle is quite small, however.</li>
    <li> Okay but should of came with a carry case with the names of the brushes in the space for quick easy grab.</li>
    <li> I really like the selection of these brushes. They take care of all my needs. I use bare mineral makeup and I use one for foundation, one for bronzer and one for eye shadow, and the flat one I don&#x27;t use. these are a great deal, a lot less expensive than others I have tried and I feel these are far superior in how they spread and blend makeup. I purchased two sets one to stay at home and one for my travel bag.</li>
    <li> I wanted some compact brushes, and I&#x27;m glad that I found these. I love the little size, great for everyday use and also for traveling. The bristles are super soft and feel great on my face. I will definitely seek out more Eco Tools products.</li>
    <li> I had looked everywhere to find decent brushes but every time I bought one, it would be too hard or it would make my sensitive skin itch so i would have to throw them away. As I was looking on amazon I came cross this brush set and I checked the reviews and it got some pretty good ones so I took the chance of buying them. They came before the arrival date so I was excited but also weary but the moment I brought them home and opened them. I was extreme happy with them. They are soft on my sensitive skin and they apply my make-up very well. The only let down is that i wish them came with their own carrying bag but other wise I love them.</li>
    <li> are good for bronzer and face power..</li>
    <li> AMAZING TEXTURE. ! And durable 🙌🏻😍😍😍 fast shipping and came well packed</li>
    <li> First of all, these are just adorable.  They are small but powerful little kabukis, all with slightly different shaped heads. I keep 2 at home, 1 in my purse and 1 at work. I love using them for tight corners, blending around edges or for applying powder all over quickly while on the go. I use these daily and have experienced zero shedding and zero problems with these little ecoTools kabuki brushes, so I would definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> They work well, and at a low price!</li>
    <li> These brushes look nice and have great soft bristles, but they are sooooo tiny! It would take you a very long time to put on your makeup with these. I bought them to replace some brushes that I got from Mineral Hygienics, but they are literally half the size and I won&#x27;t really be able to use them. These look more like a child&#x27;s toy than actual makeup brushes. Be warned! Hahaha.</li>
    <li> I love these little brushes.  They are incredibly soft and easy to hold (I actually prefer these short kabuki brushes to the long handled ones).  Great deal for what you get!!</li>
    <li> These are nice brushes..Super soft. I really like them. The only problem I have is that I thought that they were gonna be a little bit bigger but they are portable. Works just as well.</li>
    <li> Beautiful brushes - love the bristles - they clean well in just a little warm water and a drop of dish washing liquid. Would df buy again and would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of kabuki brushes, because I rather have a long handle. It&#x27;s just easier. But these are only $10 and I really wanted more face brushes. The quality of the brushes are pretty good. They&#x27;re not amazing, but for the price you get a good deal.</li>
    <li> Great for travel but kinda similar . Only works for mineral powder make up</li>
    <li> LOVE THEM. they are very soft, and it grips the makeup very well</li>
    <li> Great quality brushes that work well. Aside from the packaging I could barely get open,  I love this product!</li>
    <li> so soft. use all 4 everyday for applying foundation/powder.</li>
    <li> Easy to handle, cute to look at, as well as being very soft. Am able to get bush on beautifully.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t take the chance to use these after they arrived as they were in a badly broken case and very dirty(they looked like someone had used at least two of the four to sweep up a filthy floor)... Needless to say I didn&#x27;t use them. They were also very, very small/short. I handled them just enough to(place them back in what was left of their packaging for their return) to find they would be more than difficult to use without my small hands cramping from the way I would have to hold them.</li>
    <li> I love the way these brushes feel to the touch! Although I have not used them yet I believe they will get the job done! These were recommended by a friend of mine who is a makeup guru! Can&#x27;t wait to try them out. Also, I like the fact that the handles are short because it&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
    <li> i would buy them again! excellent to complete a make up set! definitely can tell the difference between this brushes and standard ones, and these aren&#x27;t as expensive!</li>
    <li> I like how the brushes are very firm, but soft. The only thing is that they are a little short, but that isn&#x27;t too bad. They are officially my go to brushes. Great application and they don&#x27;t waste a lot of product.</li>
    <li> Really cute brushes.  Smaller than I expected, but completely usable.  If you&#x27;re looking for something with a lot of surface area, these aren&#x27;t what you want.  But, I like them.  I find that the bronzer brush (which I use for blush) and the contour brush (which I use for blending liquid highlight) are the most useful.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use any of these with liquid foundation and the buffing brush I haven&#x27;t found very useful.  They pick up a lot of product, so that isn&#x27;t a problem.  Overall, nice brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is as described and pictured!  The bristles are super soft and the makeup goes on smooth and really blends well with these tools!  I like this because not only are my hands small, but it is so convenient for traveling as I have used it on so many of my trips!  This is definately compared to the expensive stuff.  I just don&#x27;t want the bulk of long handles and case.  I also got the 6 piece essential eye set.  I would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> These brushes are very small but they truly do work. People that say they don&#x27;t work have no technique or are beginners because you can definitely apply foundation, powder, bronzer, blush, you name it, it can be applied with these brushes. The price was fantastic, cheaper than walmart and other stores. HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
    <li> Are these small? Yes! but these are exactly what I wanted..and yes these are as soft as everyone else is saying.&lt;br /&gt; These are perfect!</li>
    <li> I purchased these from the reviews, and thank you reviewers.  You are spot on.  Great brushes, sturdy.  I actually appreciate and like that they are short, much better control of the brush.  They are so soft, yet sturdy made. Great price, way more than worth it.</li>
    <li> Very soft ...Good quality</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Really good and the size is so cute</li>
    <li> I love these they blend well and dont take up all the space in my make up bag</li>
    <li> I seriously love these brushes I really wish they weren&#x27;t limited edition. Also the price on amazon is much better than the $15 I spent at Ulta on these. They are very small and compact and are great for traveling! These brushes are very soft and never shed and apply you makeup evenly and nicely. I especially like the Buff Brush and The Dome shaped concealer brush. The concealer brush is one of the best concealer brushes I&#x27;ve ever found. I was very happy with it the shape was perfect for blending. They wash nicely and remain good quality throughout everyday use. Only advice always make sure to wash with cold water so glue doesn&#x27;t melt. Besides for that I really think these are affordable and great quality brushes!</li>
    <li> I can tell you, after owning one set, I&#x27;m back for more.  The short handles give me much more control.  Professional quality.&lt;br /&gt;I own several MAC, Smashbox, IT cosmetic, Tarte, Geller, Lauren Hutton, Lancome, BE, Chanel and other expensive brushes.  These provide an excellent result and are the basic face brushes you really need.  The short handles are what sold me.  The control truly is superior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
    <li> very soft brushes. makeup goes on great and very smooth on skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a novice at make-up but I&#x27;ve always heard good ratings about these Kabuki brushes and they&#x27;re so true. They&#x27;re really great miniture/travel size brushes, they&#x27;re soft, easy to clean, and they apply make up very well without irritating your skin.</li>
    <li> This are the best brushes I have every used in my live they are soft to the touch and they work amazingly it worth the extra money.., 💜💜💜</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING MUCH BIGGER BRUSHES. VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I RECIEVED THIS PRODUCT. I REALLY LOVE THE ECOTOOLS PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> Eco tools is a good brand, I expect nothing less from them than good quality affordable brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Long and short of it ...I would buy this again, not complaints, I&#x27;ve washed them and the bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out n they ounce right back to its original shape. I&#x27;m not make up guru and I like em</li>
    <li> Brushes are VERY Soft and the product seems to be high quality.  This was a gift and I wish I had gotten one for myself.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes because they are soft, they grab the powder and applies evenly.  the only thing i dont like is that they are kind of too small so i lose them or they knock over too easily.</li>
    <li> oh wow!  These little kubuki brushes are AMAZING.  I have never left a product review.....but honestly these deserve a glowing one.  Each brush really does something different ( I use mineral powder makeup -- so this set is perfect for that as well as applying blush/bronzer).  My favorite brush:  The concealer brush (the one shaped like the skinnier christmas tree).  You can use it under your eyes and in tight problem spots where you need a &amp;#34;denser&amp;#34; concentration of powder.  In love with these.  Ordering another set for my purse.</li>
    <li> I like these brushes. I especially like the concealer brush. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the SIZE. They are so tiny! I guess these are good to travel with when you need to reapply makeup but not for when you want to apply makeup in general. They are good brushes but they are not for heavy usage. Besides the concealer brush, the brushes are not very dense. I Absolutely LOVE the concealer brush. The other brushes are nice but definitely not for heavy use.</li>
    <li> I was in need for new brushes for a good price! This set was perfect! Got a mini brush for every need and they are sure soft! Love this brand.</li>
    <li> As I am one of the most impatient make-up lovers on the planet, I rushed out &amp; bought this set from the local Target at the full price of $14.99 because I JUST HAD TO HAVE THESE BRUSHES!  Should have waited &amp; checked here first. I do love them, especially the pointed concealer kabuki, as due to their short handles, they are much easier to transport in my purse or any make-up bags for travel.  I agree, however, with another reviewer that some of the brushes are soft enough to make denser product application difficult.  As such, I tend to use the angled brush for my highlighter shade of powder, and the flat buffing brush to dust on setting powder.  Great set, and at the more value pricing offered on Amazon, I cannot stress the overall good deal &amp; workability of the brushes. Definitely a worth-while purchase for anyone who wears make-up, be they amateur or professional.</li>
    <li> These brushes are great. For the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it. They apply to your skin smoothly and they are easy to clean. I would recommend the set.</li>
    <li> Just what i wanted/needed. I hate those little powder puffs that come with regular compacts. These are small enough to be portable while being an actual brush</li>
    <li> They came super fast, and when i opened them they where perfectly small to take with me when i travel or on the go! :) i loved them!!!!! I would definitely buy more brushes from them!!! :)</li>
    <li> Apparently my girlfriend said the bristles are not soft enough.  They&#x27;re very coarse.  She wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to those who take their makeup seriously.</li>
    <li> I would like it if these were just a tinyyyy bit softer but they&#x27;re not too scratchy, just a little bit. Good quality for the price overall.</li>
    <li> Small but highly professional brushes....Very soft on your skin!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. It feels soft. very easy to clean. the hair on the brushes doesn&#x27;t fall off. highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> These aren&#x27;t bad. I just didn&#x27;t find anything too impressive about them. Found them to be like any other make-up brushes.</li>
    <li> My package just arrived and I&#x27;m so excited! 7 days early!! The brushes are beautiful and I like how they are packaged inside the mailing envelope. I loved the little &amp;#34;Thank you and enjoy:)&amp;#34; on the paper. Great quality and fast shipping I definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> They are super soft. No shedding even after washing. The handles are really cute. They keep their shape well,  I just throw them in my makeup  bag and they are still perfect. The short handles make controlling where my bronzer, blush, highlighter is going, really easy.</li>
    <li> These are now my favorite brushes in my collection. They are super soft, perfect for traveling, and the nicest set of brushes you can buy. The four brushes that are supplied are everything that you need to do your daily concealer, foundation, bronzer, and powder. I literally love them so much and recommend them!</li>
    <li> This are way too small., flimsy,  and shred.  They where cheap but a total waste of money I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> LOVE, these brushes are perfectly handy, easy to store, find and use.  Just perfect in every aspect.  I love the ultra-soft bristles and the brushes do exactly what they are expected to.  I would buy these again and again, I wish I had known about them before I bought other real hair brushes, these are far softer and much more pleasant to use!</li>
    <li> Product was exactly as described!</li>
    <li> Good set of brushes. Good quality.</li>
    <li> These are great little brushes and so convenient for travel.  I was amazed with the quality for the price.  Far superior than I expected and I always buy top quality brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes work really well.  They are also compact and easy to store.  So far, they are holding up well.</li>
    <li> Nice inexpensive brushes, very soft and do not shed, also the handle is small but I&#x27;ve had no problems they are very manageable, so overall great buy</li>
    <li> A bit nubby bc of small handles but you know what you&#x27;re buying when you see them. It can also be helpful to have a kabuki style brush. The buff brush has been a life saver!</li>
    <li> i love excellent article</li>
    <li> These brushes are beyond soft!&lt;br /&gt;They are like clouds they feel so good!&lt;br /&gt;My sister is completely hooked!&lt;br /&gt;Way to cheap for this good of a product!</li>
    <li> though the brushes had full size handles, my fault I did not read the details better don&#x27;t see how you can use these without make up on  your hands.</li>
    <li> These brush set is just wonderful, love that is cruelty free first of all, and the brushes they are so well made, love how they feel against your skin! They work wonderfully</li>
    <li> Products work better than I had thought! I would recommend these brushes to anyone looking for good quality makeup brushes!</li>
    <li> These brushes seem durable and I like that they are travel sized and cruelty free. The contour and conceal shapes are the most useful; I&#x27;ve found the bronze and buff brushes aren&#x27;t as helpful because they are too soft.</li>
    <li> I have make-up brushes but only two old large ones similar to these.  I like the short handles because they balance in my hand for better control.  I dropped one star only because I had to use a permanent pen to mark their purpose on the bottom.  I actually wish they’d printed the specific use on the brush base.  I didn’t want to grab contouring powder and mix it with a finishing powder.  I’ve noticed no shedding.  I cut the package top off and use the base as a stand. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> These brushes are amazing and so soft. I use the small one for liquid foundation and wash it out each day. It looks like new. I have never lost a bristle on any of these brushes.</li>
    <li> I got this brush set a few weeks ago I was really exited about them (but I have to admit I forgot I ordered them because it took so long to get to me). When I first took them out of their packaging some of the brushes had been shaped weird because the had been pushed against the cardboard to long, they are kind of small too. The best thing about these brushes are how soft they are, they are also really really cute! Over all I think these brushes are good but not worth $15.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this set at all. It arrived broke. It&#x27;s not a great product. I&#x27;m not happy with it. I was expecting something different. I just dont like it. It&#x27;s not a firm brush set, go to walgreens and get a cheep set from there.</li>
    <li> I have spent tons of money on nice animal hair brushes for make up. Never again. I took a chance because of wonderful online reviews about these brushes and I love them!! No more losing bristles and ending up with pieces all over my face or down my neck. They glide smoothly and place makeup evenly. For the price you cant beat these!</li>
    <li> Love these brushes.. I bought them to use with mineral powders and they work great. Very soft and covers great.</li>
    <li> They feel really soft and comfortable on the face! I&#x27;ve been using these almost every day and definitely every time I put on makeup for about a month now and I haven&#x27;t experienced much fallout. They look cute and are super easy to use; the shorter handles allow for better application control. I also like how they&#x27;re earth-friendly and they don&#x27;t have any strange chemical scent the way some new brushes do. Delivery time surprised me because it arrived within 2 weeks! :)</li>
    <li> I love EcoTools brushes! I have almost all the sets, so I held my kabuki brush set to high expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During my initial cleaning with cold water and antibacterial soap, the contour brush bristles started falling out from the right side! I stopped washing it and hoped it would just be fine after it dried, but when I brushed it over my hand after it dried, all the loose bristles just came out again. Very sad :( it&#x27;s probably just a bad batch b/c EcoTools usually makes great brushes!</li>
    <li> These are my new favorite brushes! No bristles fall out, easy to wash, and they apply makeup so smooth. Amazing purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> I have absolutely no problem with the size of the brushes, they work perfectly and are just as easy to maneuver than any other brush in my opinion. the brushes have yet to shed and I love the way my makeup looks when I use these brushes.</li>
    <li> These eco tools brushes are amazing. Eco tools makes the softest brushes. They are small but they work so I dont mind the size.</li>
    <li> These little brushes are not only cute, they are really soft and work great. They make your blush and concealer look awesome;)</li>
    <li> These brushes are great! They are soft and have the their purpose worded underneath ever brush. I love how soft they are.</li>
    <li> This item arrived only 2 days after I ordered it! It was in perfect condition, in brand new packaging. The bristles of the kabukis are extremely soft, and their handles are sturdy with a nice metallic finish and beautiful design (reminds me of Christmas ornaments). This is a great pack and fantastic for beginners or pros in makeup!</li>
    <li> The top of the flat one is a little less dense than I was hoping for. Also, them being so short, they are a little hard to use. But that&#x27;s an error on my part for not thinking about how short and inconvenient they would be. Great for travel though.</li>
    <li> I rated ecotools Makeup kabuki brush set 5 stars because these brushes are awesome. They last forever and retain their softness. I clean them using paper towels and rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are small, once intent sizes, easy to travel with inside a makeup pouch. I tried other brands including MAC but i just loves these better than any other. Overall, great buy!</li>
    <li> These are great little kabuki brushes! They are cruelty free, are super soft &amp; I would highly recommend this set!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the small handle.  The shapes are not great. I would not buy this product again and considered returning it.</li>
    <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t an add on, but since they were only a limited time item I am glad I got it before they were gone.</li>
    <li> These are really cute and very soft. So far I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out and they fit nicely in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> these are really soft and apply the makeup pretty evenly too, i use the flat for foundation, the tilted for blush and the others for finishing touches</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking they were going to be perfect for all of my needs.  These brushes are so small that they are more for eyes then your face.. Not worth it at all.. very disappointed and now I need to find a new Kabuki Brush..</li>
    <li> Before I bought these, I had several random cheap brushes and some ELF brushes in both the Professional and Studio line. The ELF Studio Powder brush is really nice but I wanted something for contouring so I decided to give these a shot since the price was great and they&#x27;re kabuki, so they&#x27;re dense and soft. I was using the ELF Professional Bronzing and Total Face brushes before, but they&#x27;re really rough and have a lot of fallout, not to mention streaky application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use the Conceal and Contour brushes, but I use the Bronze for contouring my cheeks and Buff for blush. They&#x27;re so soft and dense! It only takes one sweep of bronzer in the hollows of my cheeks and a sweep of blush across the apples of my cheeks and I&#x27;m done! I kinda wish they were full sized, though, because it&#x27;s a little annoying only having such a small area to hold and control the brush. If this set came with full-sized handles, I would&#x27;ve bought that instead. It also makes me nervous to store them just standing up on the counter, but they&#x27;re a little too tall to go in my makeup drawer and I don&#x27;t want them to lose their shape if I lay them down. They are very pretty to look at though!</li>
    <li> Bought these as a gift for my sister who is a makeup artist. She loved them! ULTA sells a few brands that cost about $30+ for ONE, while these are 4 in a package and they feel just as soft. She uses Eco Tools and she loves the brand.</li>
    <li> Awesome little brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Good for buffing, concealing, contouring and bronzing. Great price! when washed they did not shed! Love them.</li>
    <li> Very small &amp; compact. Works great. I wish they would label the bottom of the brushes though for us non-experts.</li>
    <li> This s a great set of brushes.  the only thing i would change is that the handles were a little longer.</li>
    <li> These are so small and cute just right for me and when i&#x27;m travelling. This set is a must. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like this make -up kabuki brush..</li>
    <li> really soft and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This are adorably cute and good for on-the-go! They are good material,  wont shed and it applies makeup beautifully. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I had to re-glue the handles. Other than that they are great.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these! I can tell a difference I my make up. :)</li>
    <li> One was broken, but I dont care because I loved these. they are perfect and the bristles do not fall out</li>
    <li> My wife already owns the EcoTools 6 Piece Essential Eye Brush Set and she loves it, so this was the logical next purchase. She says they are way better than the rest of the brushes she has tried before, and the metal special edition set is a nice touch. Girl to girl, she would tell you &amp;#34;Great price, great quality...buy it!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Disapointed that the plastic box was crushed when it arrived. I would not mind if it was for me, however its a gift for a friend.</li>
    <li> These are cheap brushes although they are soft they don&#x27;t work... Wish I could get my money back and return</li>
    <li> I love these!! Can&#x27;t beat it for the price and they really work great. I love how soft they feel on my skin too. I Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a makeup brush junkie!  I have everything from MAC to E.L.F to Lacome brushes and these new little additions are becoming some of my favorites.  I actually like the short mini handles.  They also fit so easy in a smaller cosmetic bag without crushing the bristles.  They are so soft and I&#x27;ve had no issues with shedding even when cleaning them.  Blending and contouring is a breeze with these great little brushes. I also ordered the ecoTool six piece Essential Eye Brush Set and they are just as nice.  I&#x27;m going to order a few more of the ecoTools brushes since I found that these are wonderful makeup brushes.  I highly recommend giving ecoTools brushes a try.</li>
    <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ve used MAC makeup brushes for years now. I wore them completely down to the handles.</li>
    <li> Love them and they are so cute! I used them to stipple my makeup and to put on a finishing powder they worked great!</li>
    <li> Product was light weight, super easy to store, they blend makeup wonderfully, and they LAST. I am a licensed cosmetologist/ esthiologist so I use brushes everyday alllllllll day. I&#x27;ve tried the more expensive brands, and the cheaper.. EcoTOOLS have never disappointed me. I use them on myself and my clients. This package came in literally one day, completely intact, is not falling apart, and YES I would recommend this product to EVERYONE.</li>
    <li> Very soft, easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> love love love ecoTOOLS, &#x3D;] great buy, a bit smaller than i expected but overall, love how soft they feel on my face</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use makeup, bought this for my niece, she had no complaints so I consider that good.</li>
    <li> These mini&#x27;s are great. Great for starting up on brush collection. Perfect for travel but also nice to keep in makeup up drawer. Brisles are soft but dense. Would purchase these again.</li>
    <li> These brushes were exactly what I was looking for. They apply make-up incredibly well and allow me to achieve an even finish. They are also small which is convenient for travel and fits well into my hands. My make-up routine improved immensely once I purchased these brushes.</li>
    <li> These brushes are compact so easy for travel and feel great on my skin. I would recommend this buy to friends and family.</li>
    <li> These are the softest kabuki brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned. I feel like the picture is a little misleading so just to clear up they are travel sized but either way, you won&#x27;t regret purchasing these, they glide across your face and easy to store.</li>
    <li> The brush part came detached from the metal handle the very first time I used the bronzer brush. I have over ten other eco tools brushes that I love, but I was very unimpressed with the quality of this set.</li>
    <li> A must have on your Beaty bar. Something about the small handle give nice sweeps and swirls. I&#x27;m a fan on eco tools, as I have 2 brushes from a Walgreens as love them.&lt;br /&gt;Nice quality</li>
    <li> Love the variety of brushes for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased two of these ecoTOOLS Make-Up Kabuki Brush Sets (one for our daughter, one for myself) after comparing several different brands and reviews, and I&#x27;m so glad I did. To begin with, this entire set of a concealing, bronzing, contouring and buffing brushes cost less than what I normally pay at a brick and mortar store for one Kabuki buff brush alone, and the quality of these brushes is as good, if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and each of the bristle&#x27;s end tips are finely tapered, which results in a more natural, softer application with regular pressure, but probably not suitable for theatrical makeup application/stage makeup or where much heavier application is desired. The brushes hold their shape well, and feel so nice against the skin with no prickly bristles. To give a good test to the bristles, I have tugged and pulled from the middle and outside of the bristles (which is my way to predict if they are prone to shedding) and have not had one single bristle come out, so I am very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former makeup artist, I have used several different brands and types of brushes, and these are surprisingly good quality for the price, (but only for personal use because of the short handles, which would make it very awkward when doing another person&#x27;s makeup). I like that the handles of these are short, because they are perfect for travel, stow away nicely, and the shorter length doesn&#x27;t adversely affect my personal makeup application at all. These brushes are so very butter-soft are a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these brushes for anyone looking for a nice quality brush set at a very budget-friendly price.</li>
    <li> I really like the brushes but there is a funky smell in it that I am not so fond of. &#x3D;/</li>
    <li> very good , and precise!!!</li>
    <li> brushes were all so so so soft!!!! I was worried about the size of this brush but it turned out to be perfect! Ordered another set for a friend!</li>
    <li> I love ecoTools and was excited about receiving this set. However, the flat top Kabuki shed like crazy and that was the one I wanted to try out the most.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Not amazing quality, but not bad for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought these awhile ago.  Later, I purchased a different set of brushes (to be kept at work) but these are so much better, that I am purchasing another set for work.  The only way this could be better is if it had some eyeshadow/eyebrow brushes too.</li>
    <li> ended up liking half of these. I wish I would have bought the full sized one, but they are nice for traveling. extremely soft. good value. wish I would have bought a little more high quality one instead</li>
    <li> I love this brand (ecoTOOLS) I got the  Make-Up Kabuki Brush Set &amp; adore it, they are small but not tiny, they do the job well, you cant go wrong with the ecoTools.</li>
    <li> love makeup and love brushes that work. didn&#x27;t realize at the time when I ordered them they didn&#x27;t have long handles but they work great</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. I have tried many different brushes, and these are by far the best. I will only be buying these from now on.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes. So soft and they do not loose bristles.</li>
    <li> excellent purchase brushes are awesome</li>
    <li> Love this set.  Great travel set!</li>
    <li> Good quality and fast shipment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and stand up against wear and tear easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would order again and again.</li>
    <li> great just like the picture</li>
    <li> This set is so lovely and functional. The size wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I&#x27;m  just glad that it was not too small and it wasn&#x27;t too big either. I&#x27;ve used three out of four in this set and I love it. The brush heads are not too soft, nor too hard and the makeup looks natural and fresh when I use the kabuki brushes on my face.</li>
    <li> These brushes are very soft! Pleased with them so far!</li>
    <li> Help with your makeup look more suttle and they do exactly what they are supposed to do!  They are soo soft and the perfect size!</li>
    <li> they are perfect size,lets me get more control or my application. The buffer brush is amazing leaves my foundation look picture perfect.</li>
    <li> Okay brushes the bristles are soft and strong however this is a travel set and the bases are flimsy. One has already become un- glued!</li>
    <li> THEY WERE EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED AT A GREAT PRICE AND THEY ARRIVED FAST! GREAT TOOL TO HAVE FOR PUTTING ON MAKE UP!!</li>
    <li> So that must mean she is happy. Price was good, eco friendly, and a happy wife is a happy life.</li>
    <li> These brushes work really good. They apply makeup awesome. There is zero shedding. And they are super soft! Great for the price and the short handles allow for them to fit perfect in my make up bag. They came onetime when they were supposed to and I have had no problems.</li>
    <li> I got this set to go with the Coastal camouflage palette specifically for contouring.  I don&#x27;t think this was the right choice.  These brushes are very soft so to get the concealer creme color on the brush was tough but to get it to where it needed to go on my face was even harder.  I think these would be great for powders but I don&#x27;t think  they are good for creamy palettes and small spaces like where you&#x27;d want the highlight/lighter colors to be (i.e. bridge of nose, chin and forehead.)  They don&#x27;t do well for specific spaces.  Probably good for cheek shadow and all over setting powder.  The only brush I had any use for at all was the first pointy one.  The rest are practically useless for what I was going for.  Oh well.  I&#x27;ve learned.  The quality seemed okay so I gave it three stars, but if you&#x27;re going for the &amp;#34;Kim Kardashian contouring&amp;#34; keep looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Very nice brushes. Gentle and soft , not like some others that feel like poking. Loose powder goes on evenly and gradually . Very satisfied. Good quality right price fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Super soft brushes, they do a good job.</li>
    <li> The ecoTools brand is my favorite for makeup brushes.  They are very soft and they last longer then most brushes.  They also tolerate cleanings well.</li>
    <li> really good product and just what i expected, is get on time and is just beautiful and original botton line i love it</li>
    <li> Very nice set of brushes.  Much better than expected.  Will be wonderful for travel too.</li>
    <li> These are very nice cruelty free, soft no-shed brushes, but they are smaller than I thought they&#x27;d be. Still useful, but just be warned that none of them is any taller than your thumb.</li>
    <li> I really liked these because of how soft they are. It took a while for me to &amp;#34;load&amp;#34; the brushes though when I first got them. It took a lot of powder but they serve their purpose very well. I only wish these had long handles instead of short.</li>
    <li> I am a teenager who loves to do makeup! I bought these brushes a little skeptical about the quality but since they were so cheap I too a chance. When they arrived I was so pleased! The brushes are tiny enough that you can travel with them but the quality is amazing. None of the hairs on the brushes have came out and I work my brushes hard. They are extremely soft and very easy to work with. All of my friends are jealous of them and all of them are buying them. I would recommend these 100% love love love!!!!</li>
    <li> Very nice, soft brushes!  Love them!  Great for contouring, blush and powder (or at least that is what I use them for).  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I love love love these brushes!! They apply makeup and blend flawlessly. I travel frequently and they are easy to pack.</li>
    <li> I regret bbuying them. So small....and it is not dense so it wouldn&#x27;t blend anything but drags...it is too expensive for this quality</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just began to purchase the proper tools for putting on makeup. I didn&#x27;t want to buy anything too expensive. These were cheap, they work for applying makeup and they are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> good quality, nice product, will definatley purchase again, just as described online, bought them for a friend and am going to buy a set for myself now.</li>
    <li> The price on these is awesome and you get a wonderful brush product. The small handle makes it great for&lt;br /&gt;travel and in your gym bag. Like these a lot!!!</li>
    <li> This kabuki brush set is more than I thought I would get.  I use Bare minerals and was just looking for brushes with a little more control, since I use two different foundations, warmth, and mineral veil.  What I got was a set of brushes that are soft, thick, and easy to load.  They hold the foundation well and are great for control on all parts of my face.  The size is perfect, compact enough to put in my purse, but not so small they can&#x27;t do the job of a full size brush.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Thought this product was very nice. The brushes are verry soft and came early! I would buy them again. Slightly pricey for size though!</li>
    <li> To be able to find such a great quality of brushes for such a low price was a bargain ! I love my brushes , they are so soft and great quality ! Also great for \\&quot;on the go\\&quot; because they are travel size ! Couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase, and it got to me so fast in the mail . I highly recommend this seller !</li>
    <li> This is my &amp;#34;starter&amp;#34; kabuki set if you will. They&#x27;re great, well made little brushes. Hardly any shedding compared to my bare minerals brushes. Highly recommend if you want to try out some different styles of kabukis before investing in the larger, more expensive versions.</li>
    <li> I bought theses brushes cause i read the reviews they were really soft n fluffy I mostly use the concealer brush but nice brushes.</li>
    <li> Perfect makeup brushes. Handles of others I had were always breaking off so these are perfect. Nice and soft. And don&#x27;t shed much if at all.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy Real Techniques after lots of research, but decided to stick with this brand because I own some smaller brushes. Glad I decided to order this instead. I read some reviews that Real Technique brushes shed. I have Eco tools and they have never shed on me so I decided to stick with this brand. The brush are short, not small as others say. It is very full. I love them so much. it is small probably so that it can be more convenient to travel. Either way i am glad about the purchase.</li>
    <li> I order this brushes for a gift and I was a bit  disappointed I thought they were bigger. They are kind of small, maybe good for traveling. My sister told the handle came out as soon as she opened them didn&#x27;t even try them yet. Anyways she glue them back and they do the job. So They are ok. Just keep in mind they are small.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put it in my to go make up bag. The brushes are so soft and work great. The only thing that could make them better is if the buffer brush was a little but more stiff.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. On top of the brushes being environmentally friendly they work wonderfully!</li>
    <li> Super soft! Great quality and adorable! Fast shipping! A+</li>
    <li> These brushes are incredibly soft. They hold a lot of pigment, buff well, and fit well in any make up case.</li>
    <li> I like the set and the fact that you get a set of kabuki brushes with different shapes, at one low price. They are a little smaller than I expected but they&#x27;re still good brushes that don&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;m still searching for one good, soft, fluffy kabuki brush that won&#x27;t shed. I have other brushes by ecotools and they&#x27;re great brushes. For the price, I would recommend these.</li>
    <li> The only brush I really find useful is the concealer brush the others are decent</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about three months now and they&#x27;re great! I use the powder one most frequently and they&#x27;re easy to clean and easy to transport! Very quality. I also love the contour one. I don&#x27;t use all of the brushes regularly, but the price was so great that it&#x27;s worth it to have them just in case! I recommend them to all my friends.</li>
    <li> Received the items. Packaging was perfect and the tools inside were great. Such soft bristles, the handles were nice and the packaging even advised what the brush was for, which was cute. Yes, they are small, however you can see that from the photos, I have better control with these, and I&#x27;ve trashed all my older cheaper brushes. This was a great buy</li>
    <li> These are great! Great price and as expected.</li>
    <li> My sister love this eco tools makeup.</li>
    <li> Very soft brushes! Almost as good as &amp;#34;IT&amp;#34; BRUSHES  yet 1/4 of the price!</li>
    <li> 💋 Got these for my neice for Christmas. She&#x27;s the style guru of our fam &amp; I was so scared she wouldn&#x27;t like them (she is used to only the very best of everything). But she absolutely loved them! She said they were excellent quality &amp; oh so soft!</li>
    <li> nice make up brushset</li>
    <li> Great little set. Very portable, easy to clean, and versatile.</li>
    <li> These are really good quality, especially for the price.  I also love buying environmental friendly products when the option is available.</li>
    <li> I bought these brushes originally for a trip because of their small size. However, I found that they were such good quality that I have used them every day since then and after 16 months they have all kept their shape and have not lost a single hair. Considering the price as well these are a wonderful buy and I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> i like these brushes, they are really soft and nice to have on your face when applying makeup. I especially love the buffer brush, my makeup looks flawless after using it. prompt delivery. condition 10/10</li>
    <li> I thought that the product wouldn&#x27;t be as good because it is not sold in drugstores. However it is fairly decent as brushes. I would like to say I use and own a good sum of makeup. I own some brushes and decided to try these out. I like the brushes they are great to use to put makeup on. The kabuki is good for putting blush or bronzer. The angled blush brush is not only good for blush and bronzer but foundation as well. The concealer brush is good to use as a foundation brush since it is dense. The contour brush is good for adding highlight. These brushes are multifunctional so it is an added benefit. Sure the quality cannot be compared to Sephora or the higher brands. However, for the price it is really decent. Recommended for people who don&#x27;t mind how small it is and looking for decent and pretty cheap brushes.</li>
    <li> I am excited to use the brushes and take them along with me on a cruise.  They are just the right size to pack easily</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t see via the image, but this is a set of pretty small brushes. I would say they are as tall as a credit card. So, if you were unaware, you may be disappointed. These brushes are great for travel, or to toss in your purse. They are actually pretty high quality. I haven&#x27;t seen a single shed hair and I&#x27;ve had these for nearly 6 months. That&#x27;s pretty amazing since I have seen shed hairs on some brushes I&#x27;ve purchased at Sephora or MAC. I bought this to quickly toss in my purse and it is a great product. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> This is the perfect combination of brushes for applying makeup to your face.  I wish they had longer handles but they still are amazing sooo soft.</li>
    <li> The handles on these are too small to comfortably hold although the bristles do feel soft. I would love to return these for a full refund, but the return shipping is cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> they are cheap and do the good job, my face look really flawless when i use these brushes.they blending pretty well.</li>
    <li> These brushes are nice and soft, however they are small.  I like the price and product, but just be prepared for a small brush with a short handle.</li>
    <li> The brushes are soft, no shedding (yet). I hope it stays that way. Exactly what the picture shows is what you get.</li>
    <li> Love ecotools and their price point. Very high quality. I have had this set for a long time and they havent shed on me or distorted. Very soft on your skin, blends everything seamlessly. Love ecotools have many other brushes from them would never buy another mac brush after discovering this brand.</li>
    <li> Always been a huge fan of ecotools. was really only interested in this set for the flattop kabuki. As always, ecotools gave me super high quality, dense and soft brushes. Love this set even though I dont really use the other brushes as often.</li>
    <li> I really like these brushes because they are indeed super soft, they are eco friendly which is a plus but i find them too small, which they could retract to a normal and travel size making it have dual purposes</li>
    <li> But they travel well and they do the job.  They&#x27;re very soft and they didn&#x27;t smell, like brushes I have used in the past.  They&#x27;re great for travel or as a starter set!</li>
    <li> i really like this brushes, they are soft and good quality, but i dont know if i would repurchase them.. good brushes for the price, but not so confortable yo use</li>
    <li> OK, not sure why I didn&#x27;t get these sooner. My makeup looks much more lovely each time I use these brushes vs. the brush that the item came with. And such a good price!</li>
