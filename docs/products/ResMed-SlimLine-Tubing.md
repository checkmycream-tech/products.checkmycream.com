      <li>This tubing is great.</li>
      <li>The Resmed brand of this listing is excellent, but make sure that&#x27;s what you end up being sent.     </li>
      <li>Again, excellent product, authentic Respmed product for sleep apnea</li>
      <li>Great product,even better price!</li>
      <li>and no difference and good price.</li>
      <li>I figured this was a good price for the tubing without having to deal with my health insurance paperwork/delays.</li>
      <li>good price and in factory packaging.  </li>
      <li>everything seems to be in good shape.</li>
      <li>BUT, it is a good quality tube at any rate.</li>
      <li>I have tried to use this with the fleece cover - it still isn&#x27;t as good.</li>
      <li>It connected perfectly on my S9 machine and Philips Amara full face mask.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
      <li>This is very good quality but not as flexible as the original ResMed tubing.  </li>
      <li>Remember the shorter the better the machine works!</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with my purchase!</li>
      <li>The ResMed brand hose is much more durable!  </li>
      <li>Perfect fit and budget friendly!</li>
      <li>Just honestly describe what you are selling.  </li>
      <li>I have found that the tubing wrap as shown here makes a good thing even better:</li>
      <li>I already know it will not be cost effective to return, so</li>
      <li>Will buy more as my ins doesn&#x27;t cover these any more!</li>
      <li>Great buy, fits perfectly and very durable and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>This product is light weight and arrived on time in good condition.</li>
      <li>The nurses recommended trying a nasal pillow, and the ResMed was the what they claimed was most popular.  </li>
      <li>I would bet my health on these hoses :-)</li>
      <li>Need to make sure your CPAP is compatible with this type of hose before purchase.</li>
      <li>There are many complaints in these ratings that some sellers are sending \\&quot;generics\\&quot; instead of official Resmed brand in the photo/listing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I found this affordable option.</li>
      <li>I suspect I&#x27;ll be ordering most all of my supplies from Amazon going forward.</li>
      <li>(and better priced then others).</li>
      <li>ResMed is my favorite line..</li>
      <li>Bought this item because it was lighter and smaller in diameter which is perfect for a flip flop sleeper.</li>
      <li>A got the real thing, at a great price, and it was delivered promptly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much better than the cheaper tubing that fits with my CPAP</li>
      <li>Perfect replacement part for the 10 year old original.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is very light and easily packed tubing too.  </li>
      <li>If you do purchase this item, I strongly recommend you buy some electrical tape and re-enforce where the tube joins with the rubber fitting.</li>
      <li>Happy with it so far.</li>
      <li>I was concerned about the many reviews in which third-party products were shipped instead of the ResMed, but one review said they received a genuine item from CPAP Deals, so I gave it a shot and ordered from them.</li>
      <li>This is much more comfortable and reliable when compared to masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good pruduct, fast delivery too.</li>
      <li>Lighter than the original and still durable, my husband is pleased.  </li>
      <li>Easy to pack for travel and the thinner design is easier to sleep with.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s easy for me to go sereral days and carry along</li>
      <li>This slimline tubing filled the bill.</li>
      <li>IMPORTANT:</li>
      <li>What I did not know is the material strength is greatly sacrificed and it falls short of it&#x27;s 6 foot length claim.</li>
      <li>and it does fit the machine</li>
      <li>Nice slim and seems to be very sturdy.</li>
      <li>And to help with anyone who might have fears this is cheap knockoff stuff, It came in resmed branded packaging, and has the resmed logo embedded in the tube ends.</li>
      <li>As I started using the extremely light Pilairo CPAP nose mask a lighter tubing was indicated.</li>
      <li>That said, I received the genuine item from seller \\&quot;all4CPAP\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Great replacement tubing same as the original.</li>
      <li>really will not leave home without it!!!</li>
      <li>If you can get the original</li>
      <li>Tubing is a bit flimsy compared to the original.</li>
      <li>I purchased this item through Amazon because I know that I pay so much more for it by it being charged to my insurance with me being responsible for the difference.  </li>
      <li>That hose was &#x27;soft&#x27; and supple, and it moved really nicely with me as I turned in my sleep.</li>
      <li>Not bad</li>
      <li>got!&lt;br /&gt;the item I was shipped is so clearly not from the \\&quot;original equipment manufacturer\\&quot;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is replacing another tube of the same kind and that one worked fine</li>
      <li>Received quickly.</li>
      <li>quick mailing of product.  </li>
      <li>This tubing is new to me, that&#x27;s why i ordered it because it looks more flexible and moveable during sleep.  </li>
      <li>I got 10 hrs of sleep last night and feel pretty good today....</li>
      <li>On the positive side, I did receive a genuine ResMed Slimline hose.</li>
      <li>Giving a 5 star (for now anyway,will change if need to later) because it arrived quickly and in a nice sealed package.</li>
      <li>stars, very durable, light and easier to move around with when sleeping.</li>
      <li>it is well worth it.</li>
      <li>A little stiffer than my original product But a good thing thing.</li>
      <li>If you clean your mask and tube regularly as you should it will surely rip when separating the mask.</li>
      <li>Bought this Item as an emergency replacement and because price was right, received &amp;iacute;tem for another brand (philips respironics tube).</li>
      <li>The major weakness is where the tube joins to the rubber fitting.</li>
      <li>I still have the old one, so it&#x27;s easy to compare them.</li>
      <li>Whatmany buyers don&#x27;t understand is that Amazon does not check that sellers are providing exactly what&#x27;s in the listing that the seller linked to (even if \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot;, it just means Amazon packed what the seller provided them without checking it).</li>
      <li>This tube is exactly what I received from my cPap equipment provider</li>
      <li>This tube is so much better then the standard but still needs improvement at the joints.</li>
      <li>Well worth the only slightly higher cost to get the higher-quality original brand.    </li>
      <li>Start wrapping from the rubber fitting to about three inches down the tube and back up around the fitting again.</li>
      <li>Asked for a return, and the seller actually blamed me for not reading the fine print.</li>
      <li>I pay out of my own pocket for the much-superior official Resmed brand tubing (rather using the generic replacement my insurance gives me free) because it is \\&quot;slinkier\\&quot; and \\&quot;less springy\\</li>
      <li>If your rubber connector is smooth with no raised wording, it&#x27;s a generic, and the seller on your particular sale is ripping you off!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s still reasonable since it&#x27;s a branded Resmed product.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It works great as a backup, for travel or if you need one in a jam. It is not a resmed brand. Tubing is a bit flimsy compared to the original. Price however is great and makes up the difference. Just do order an extra for use as a backup.</li>
    <li> Great product,even better price!</li>
    <li> Great resmed branded O.E. tube.  So much easier to buy and replace off ebay than locally.</li>
    <li> This is great tubing, holds up! I replace my tubing  every three months for sanitary reasons, but I have never had to replace tubing for damage.</li>
    <li> IMPORTANT: The Resmed brand of this listing is excellent, but make sure that&#x27;s what you end up being sent.     There are many complaints in these ratings that some sellers are sending \\&quot;generics\\&quot; instead of official Resmed brand in the photo/listing. Check what you receive carefully! (see tips below) Contact Amazon and give bad rating to the particular SELLER on your receipt (not the item) if that happens. The default seller for an item is constantly changing based on lowest price, so you won&#x27;t necessarily get the same seller as another buyer who posted a review.     That said, I received the genuine item from seller \\&quot;all4CPAP\\&quot;. I pay out of my own pocket for the much-superior official Resmed brand tubing (rather using the generic replacement my insurance gives me free) because it is \\&quot;slinkier\\&quot; and \\&quot;less springy\\&quot; in actual use than generics, so it annoys me less, which matters with CPAPs where every bit of comfort helps.    It&#x27;s less likely get caught up in the bedding or to dislodge my nasal pillows enough to leak as I roll around. I truly am woken up half as often by my CPAP during the night when using Resmed brand tubing. Well worth the only slightly higher cost to get the higher-quality original brand.    WARNING: Like any Amazon purchase, make sure that you actually receive the official Resmed manufactured version -- it has name \\&quot;RESMED\\&quot; molded twice into each grey rubber connector end. If your rubber connector is smooth with no raised wording, it&#x27;s a generic, and the seller on your particular sale is ripping you off! I received the genuine item, but default sellers on Amazon listings constantly change, and there is a big problem with sometimes receiving knock-off versions of things that sellers put under the Amazon page for the genuine manufacturer instead of under a listing describing it as a generic replacement (also issues on some popular items with illegally manufactured \\&quot;forgeries\\&quot; that don&#x27;t pay the legitimate patent holders or have same quality)    Whatmany buyers don&#x27;t understand is that Amazon does not check that sellers are providing exactly what&#x27;s in the listing that the seller linked to (even if \\&quot;fulfilled by Amazon\\&quot;, it just means Amazon packed what the seller provided them without checking it). Sellers can be anybody who applies, like on ebay (including individuals in other countries with very lax patent protection), and sellers can choose to attach their product to any pre-existing description. I have multiple times received generic or illegal \\&quot;knock offs\\&quot; of various items from Amazon sellers who improperly listed under the Brand name description page on Amazon.    So for any Amazon purchase, check the packaging and item you receive carefully. If it&#x27;s not the legit item you paid for, ding the seller (not the product listing) and contact Amazon who will refund you.</li>
    <li> .was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> I useD it to replace the much thicker tubing last night.  It works perfectly, my CPAP works perfectly.  I got 10 hrs of sleep last night and feel pretty good today....Anything that lightens the load of carrying my machine on trips is welcome.  I have used a variety of machines from ResMed for thirty years and take my machine everywhere I know I will be sleeping the night....really will not leave home without it!!!</li>
    <li> Not particularly made of durable material, it feels cheap, but then again at this price it&#x27;s still reasonable since it&#x27;s a branded Resmed product.  The slimline is definitely easier to deal with than traditional tubing.</li>
    <li> I have the resmed s9.  When my supplier decided to skimp on the hose and started sending me a junk generic hose with plastic ends, I took a chance and bought 3 of these.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.  These are the genuine resmed product, only about 10 dollars each.  I would bet my health on these hoses :-)</li>
    <li> The tubing I received is manufactured by Respironics Inc. and of lower quality.  Not bad I suppose for the $9 but I expect to get what I pay for &amp; not some cheap imitation.  I&#x27;m sending it back to get a quality product from another vendor.  This vender is intentionally wasting my time and yours with their unscrupulous advertising.</li>
    <li> Do not buy from this seller or if you do realize that you are not getting a real ResMed product as pictured and described.  It will work with your S9 machine, but I feel taken advantage of by this seller.  Just honestly describe what you are selling.  The product you receive sells for $8 or $9 on other CPAP websites.</li>
    <li> This product is light weight and arrived on time in good condition. It is an extra to have on reserve when humidification is not available or desired. I would order this product from this company again.</li>
    <li> I made a mistake ordering this tubing because it does not have the end with the metal piece ...maybe for heating? BUT, it is a good quality tube at any rate.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be Resmed slimline tubing, but this it generic crap that I can buy off Ebay for less than $5.00.  Resmed tubing doesn&#x27;t have the sellers website printed on the bag with a label stuck to the bag stating it is Resmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added a couple of images to show people what they actually get, some generic house brand crap versus an actual Resmed slimline tubing like they are supposed to.  DO NOT BUY from this person or you will probably get crap like I did.</li>
    <li> As I started using the extremely light Pilairo CPAP nose mask a lighter tubing was indicated. This slimline tubing filled the bill.</li>
    <li> It was not a slim line tubing but standard heavy one not as advertised.not as shown.misrepresented would like to have right ones sent</li>
    <li> Junk hose that split in 2 weeks.  Hard to tell the quality from the pictures but this was not good.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Thinner and lighter than regular cpap tubing. I read that there was some problems where the hose meets the connector so I just reinforced it with &#x27;rescue tape&#x27; beforehand. I haven&#x27;t had any problems the last 2 months.</li>
    <li> Again, excellent product, authentic Respmed product for sleep apnea machine.&lt;br /&gt;New and no difference and good price. Received quickly. Will buy here again.</li>
    <li> When I learned that I needed to use a CPAP device to sleep properly, I immediate became concerned about masks and my ability to wear one at night.  The nurses recommended trying a nasal pillow, and the ResMed was the what they claimed was most popular.  I tried this system and found that it worked perfectly for me...  I sometimes forget I have it on.  This is much more comfortable and reliable when compared to masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any medical supply item, the tubing needs to be replaced from time-to-time.  If your insurance doesn&#x27;t pay for the parts, it can be quite expensive to get them through normal medical supply channels.  Buying these parts on Amazon cut my cost to 1/3 or less than what I would have normally paid, and it&#x27;s the exact same product.  I suspect I&#x27;ll be ordering most all of my supplies from Amazon going forward.</li>
    <li> Even though the bag I received said resmed slimline, the tube inside was not - it was ordinary, thick, off brand tubing.</li>
    <li> I see some people saying not Res Med, but mine came in a Res Med bag (I can post a photo) and it works perfectly.  The last replacement hose I bought was not Res Med and it deteriorated to the point I got &amp;#34;High leak in last session&amp;#34; each time I used it.  I will post further if I have problems, but so far looks as advertised.</li>
    <li> As advertised.  A little stiffer than my original product But a good thing thing. Fits well at the extemities too, and seals properly.</li>
    <li> This item is not what is stated!  This is not a ResMed item it is a horrible cheap version and they should not be able to put ResMed&#x27;s name if that is not what their product is.  I am using the tube as I have no choice while waiting for the new one to arrive and it does fit the machine but that is all I can say about this product!  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This tube is exactly what I received from my cPap equipment provider however it was 1/3 of the cost!  This replacement tube seems to be the same product (same sku) as the original tube that came with the equipment.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Asked for a return, and the seller actually blamed me for not reading the fine print. When you advertise an item with a picture, you should send what is pictured. If you send something different, it is mispresentation. Cut &amp; Dry. Don&#x27;t order from this seller. Really needed this item. If you are going to sell items that pertain to the life and death of the buyer...sleep apnea..sell what you advertise. The tubing I received is a Phillips brand and does not even have the same connections. Can&#x27;t even use it. Hose is stiff and not even the same quality. You get what you pay for...lessen learned.</li>
    <li> Pets bite on the hose tubbing, they get moldy if you do not take hose out every day. They must be change 2-3 times a year. I&#x27;m glad I found this affordable option.</li>
    <li> Arrived as described, on time, and no problems.</li>
    <li> I like this hose much better than the standar one, seems to get in the way a lot less now.</li>
    <li> Bought this Item as an emergency replacement and because price was right, received &amp;iacute;tem for another brand (philips respironics tube).</li>
    <li> This is not made by Res Med. It is extremely thin plastic and cheap connectors. It worked in a pinch but will not last. I should have known by the price.</li>
    <li> I was concerned about the many reviews in which third-party products were shipped instead of the ResMed, but one review said they received a genuine item from CPAP Deals, so I gave it a shot and ordered from them. On the positive side, I did receive a genuine ResMed Slimline hose. The packing was clearly from ResMed and it has the embossed logos on the ends. On the negative side, this hose isn&#x27;t exactly like the slimline hose I am replacing that came with my Autoset S9. That hose was &#x27;soft&#x27; and supple, and it moved really nicely with me as I turned in my sleep. This one, although identical in dimensions, is stiff and plasticky. It tries to retain it&#x27;s shape from the package and doesn&#x27;t move with me as easily. It&#x27;s the real thing, but it looks like the real thing has been cheapened by ResMed. I still have the old one, so it&#x27;s easy to compare them. I wouldn&#x27;t say not to buy this, because there is probably nothing better out there, but it&#x27;s still disappointing that I cannot get an identical replacement for my hose.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit and budget friendly! What else can I ask for!</li>
    <li> This does not fit my machine at all.  This is the second one I have that does not work for me...</li>
    <li> Bought this item to replace the &amp;#34;Slim Line&amp;#34; tubing that I currently have - but when I received it ... found to be the old heavy duty type tubing that I no longer use. This was not the new Slim Line , soft - flexible tubing that I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added to my draw of used and useless CPAP equipment.</li>
    <li> I use a pink ResMed machine, it is great to have that little extra length when you just can&#x27;t get the machine any closer. Remember the shorter the better the machine works!</li>
    <li> I move around in the night (my wife complains) so I end up tugging on the hose and it gets under my arm when I roll on my side away from the machine.  Due to this I really prefer this slimmer tube design.  I have found that the tubing wrap as shown here makes a good thing even better: [[ASIN:B007BN2LS8 ResMed SlimLine Tubing Wrap]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very light and easily packed tubing too.  I like that my unit is small enough to toss in a carry on and I roll this tube around the outer edge of the bag (on the inside) and it&#x27;s easy for me to go sereral days and carry along the CPAP too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing to point out is that even though my insurance covers replacing the tubing on occasion, the medical provider they use charges so much that I find it offensive.  I can buy it myself here for a third of the price or less.  I figure it&#x27;s just one small thing I can do to lower medical expenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, very durable, light and easier to move around with when sleeping.</li>
    <li> Same as the one I got at the hospital.</li>
    <li> Not the same as picture. No writing on hose ends and not the same as my other resmed tube. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a very good hose and does a good job.  Need to make sure your CPAP is compatible with this type of hose before purchase.</li>
    <li> Unlike what other reviewers described, my hose arrived from CPAP Deals and was OEM ResMed tubing. I figured this was a good price for the tubing without having to deal with my health insurance paperwork/delays. I am satisfied with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Fits great; works great; great price.</li>
    <li> Great buy, fits perfectly and very durable and easy to clean. (and better priced then others). It is light weight, flexible and attached to base with is. Good quality!</li>
    <li> Much smaller diameter and lighter than other tubes. Easy to pack for travel and the thinner design is easier to sleep with. Doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;krinkel\\&quot; like other tubes either. Good pruduct, fast delivery too.</li>
    <li> No issues with the piping and are brand new comes with OEM packaging. Will buy more as my ins doesn&#x27;t cover these any more!</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews I was worried about getting an off-brand.  A got the real thing, at a great price, and it was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Best hose out there, they should all be slim line.</li>
    <li> Perfect replacement part for the 10 year old original.</li>
    <li> Do not buy from the above seller, they are running a bait and switch scam.  Title says ResMed, Picture is ResMed, but you will receive a much inferior tubing.  When you ask why they will tell you it&#x27;s the same as ResMed for a lessor price.  My CPAP machine is ResMed and I only use original Resmed products.  If you can get the original it is a great tubing.  Beware of what your buying.  Amazon should ban this seller for scamming customers.</li>
    <li> This is not the ResMed slim tub. It is a knock off. This tube is larger and does not fit in my slimline cover.  It is also cheaper material</li>
    <li> I use this as a back up to my heated tubing - if I am waiting for a new heated, I use this. I have tried to use this with the fleece cover - it still isn&#x27;t as good. I need a lot of humidity - when it is colder, the water condenses in the tube, and I get water droplets blowing on me... not as cool as you would think in the middle of sleeping!</li>
    <li> Works like it should.  This is my second one.  They do loosen up over time but no cracks.</li>
    <li> This tubing is new to me, that&#x27;s why i ordered it because it looks more flexible and moveable during sleep.  I thought I&#x27;d try it. So far it seems like 5 star quality, and will hold up better than the ordinary larger plastic hose.</li>
    <li> I only put this at 5 Stars so people would see it! BUYER BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;This was listed as a ResMed Hose &amp; a ResMed Hose is displayed in the photo. Received an aftermarket hose labeled SUNSET Health Care Solutions.  I&#x27;ve already had one of this brand before and it developed a leak in a month.  The ResMed brand hose is much more durable!  I trusted their picture; even used a magnifying glass to read the side of the tube!  I already know it will not be cost effective to return, so I guess I am stuck with it.  ***AFTER I COMPLAINED TO SELLER, THEY DID SHIP ME THE REAL THING***</li>
    <li> This tubing is great. Nice slim and seems to be very sturdy. Would buy again when needing a replacement for my machine.</li>
    <li> WARNING!!! be careful with this seller, the picture on this listing is not what I got!&lt;br /&gt;the item I was shipped is so clearly not from the \\&quot;original equipment manufacturer\\&quot;!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hose I recieved does not have the usual \\&quot;slimline\\&quot; imprinting at the ends and has a slightly tighter fit than the real ResMed hose.</li>
    <li> Great replacement tubing same as the original.</li>
    <li> This nose hose is sturdy &amp; long enough to be able to turn &amp; sleep confortably on either side.The end fittings will not slip off while you are sleeping.</li>
    <li> This is very good quality but not as flexible as the original ResMed tubing.  It&#x27;s much better than the cheaper tubing that fits with my CPAP though so I gave it four stars.</li>
    <li> ResMed is my favorite line.. they put lots on engineering into their products..  works find for me... I have recommended this.</li>
    <li> Very good product, works great and no problems.</li>
    <li> They advertise ResMed... they show pictures of ResMed Slimline Tubing, but then ship an &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; brand.  Our lives depend on these machines... I do not want a knockoff.</li>
    <li> have not used this yet (waiting on being able to get other needed pieces). Giving a 5 star (for now anyway,will change if need to later) because it arrived quickly and in a nice sealed package. everything seems to be in good shape. It is replacing another tube of the same kind and that one worked fine so this one should too.</li>
    <li> Bought this item because it was lighter and smaller in diameter which is perfect for a flip flop sleeper. What I did not know is the material strength is greatly sacrificed and it falls short of it&#x27;s 6 foot length claim. The major weakness is where the tube joins to the rubber fitting. If you clean your mask and tube regularly as you should it will surely rip when separating the mask. This tube is so much better then the standard but still needs improvement at the joints. If you do purchase this item, I strongly recommend you buy some electrical tape and re-enforce where the tube joins with the rubber fitting. Start wrapping from the rubber fitting to about three inches down the tube and back up around the fitting again. This will greatly extend the life of this hose even though it will add some weight it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I thought what I was getting.  Happy with it so far.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item through Amazon because I know that I pay so much more for it by it being charged to my insurance with me being responsible for the difference.  I will definitely order this product when it&#x27;s time!</li>
    <li> Lighter than the original and still durable, my husband is pleased.  I would definitely recommend this this product to anyone who needs it.</li>
    <li> great spare hose if not using the climate line hose.  good price and in factory packaging.  quick mailing of product.  happy with what I received.</li>
    <li> I bought this hose to get rid of the humidifier box and heated tubing on my Resmed S9. I never use the humidifier because it gives me respiratory problems. Now the tube runs straight from the cpap machine to my mask and doesn&#x27;t whistle through the empty humidifier box housing. And to help with anyone who might have fears this is cheap knockoff stuff, It came in resmed branded packaging, and has the resmed logo embedded in the tube ends. It is indeed the real deal. It connected perfectly on my S9 machine and Philips Amara full face mask. Seems to be of the same quality as my old heated tube.</li>
    <li> The images shown in the selling of the item show both &amp;#34;ResMed&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;SlimLine&amp;#34;  The hose sold seems to be to spec for a ResMed SlimLine, but comes packaged in another brand bag and lacks any branding.  Overall I&#x27;m not disappointed.  It is a high quality OEM alternative, but feel that they are somewhat disingenuous as representing it as OEM.</li>
