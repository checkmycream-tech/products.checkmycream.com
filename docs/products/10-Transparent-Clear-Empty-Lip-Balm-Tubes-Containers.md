<li> In fairness they did show up a week earlier than &#x27;expected.&#x27;</li>
<li> downside was that they shipped from China, so I had to put off making the Chapstick due to long shipping times.</li>
<li> They do not fit nearly tight enough</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry to give the first review and have it be negative, but the caps are too big.</li>
<li> and things will get a bit messy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m afraid the lid will fall off</li>
<li> These are awful.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They were as described ,and shipped on time.</li>
    <li> they were great just what i needed!!! ^-^</li>
    <li> Containers arrived on time, look just like the picture and although I read a review about the caps not fitting correctly the ones I received fit perfectly. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My kids and I made Chapstick and were very happy.</li>
    <li> Great little tubes. The lids have stayed on for me, but they don&#x27;t &#x27;snap&#x27; like commercial Chapstick tubes.&lt;br /&gt;I like the clear to see how much is left.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside was that they shipped from China, so I had to put off making the Chapstick due to long shipping times. In fairness they did show up a week earlier than &#x27;expected.&#x27;</li>
    <li> On time and just what i wanted</li>
    <li> These are good for bees wax lip balm. Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to give the first review and have it be negative, but the caps are too big. They do not fit nearly tight enough and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use them. I&#x27;m afraid the lid will fall off and things will get a bit messy. The tubes are standard sized and when I tried a Burt&#x27;s Bees cap on it fit perfectly. The problem is with all of the caps that I received.</li>
    <li> very well made for the price</li>
    <li> Well first off, they weren&#x27;t transparent. They were white and you could not see through them. Next, when I filled the containers with lip balm, I tried scrolling one of them up and it broke. The bottom piece just came out and when I tried to put it back in, it would not go in.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fantastic. It can scroll up and down like real lip balm container.</li>
    <li> These are very challenging to fill even with a funnel.  Something that premeasures the amount for each tube would help.</li>
    <li> Great product just what I was looking for, great price as fast shipping</li>
    <li> The tubes will wind up/down in your pocket and dispense product when you don&#x27;t want it dispensed. These are awful.</li>
    <li> They are exactly as described and worked perfectly for my homemade lip balms. No spills, no issues.  Caps fit tightly. Will be ordering more soon.</li>
