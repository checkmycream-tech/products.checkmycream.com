      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>They are wonderful.</li>
      <li>But the pads are wonderful!</li>
      <li>Best product ever!</li>
      <li>They work best when you rub the pads on dyed skin soon after the dye has been applied.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product.  </li>
      <li>These pads work incredibly well at removing the majority of dye stain on my face.  </li>
      <li>very STRONG smell!!</li>
      <li>these work great.</li>
      <li>Happy to find it online.  </li>
      <li>(but my hair looked great).</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>Works just great to remove color .</li>
      <li>Very handy instead of using cotton balls and some cream.</li>
      <li>Works good.</li>
      <li>They had a substitute product that would have cost quite a bit more!</li>
      <li>Wish the smell of the pads would be a bit more pleasant</li>
      <li>After coloring my own hair, there is always color on my skin around the eyebrows (which I use the hair color on), and around the forehead hairline.  </li>
      <li>Packing was excellent and shipped fast.</li>
      <li>This removes it nicely and neatly.</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>This removes stray air dye from your skin to easily!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff but so does my dog ----</li>
      <li>I would love to see a version of this</li>
      <li>so I can apply it to my own cotton rounds, as these are VERY saturated, which is good value-wise, but I feel like I could get more out of it if I could control the amount.</li>
      <li>I die my own eyebrows and with these pads I can do a fantastic job removing any remnants of the die off my skin.</li>
      <li>Nothing works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>Works as well as the ones I used to buy at the salon but much better price.  </li>
      <li>Here&#x27;s the caveat: make sure you don&#x27;t try to wash the dye off with water/soap/etc.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This product here lasts and works like magic.</li>
      <li>these clean up the skin nicely every time.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find my product online at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The scent of this product is strong.  </li>
      <li>After reading the positive reviews on this product, I decided to take matters into my own hands and--let me tell you--this stuff WORKS.</li>
      <li>They are truly fantastic.</li>
      <li>I dye my eyebrows (I&#x27;m quite fair) and thus I always have to deal with huge Groucho Marx eyebrows for a day or two due to the fact that my skin gets dyed along with the eyebrow hairs.  </li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>
      <li>It takes the dye stains right off, no problem.</li>
      <li>In order for it to look somewhat natural, I have to dye the baby fine hair that frames my face.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It works pretty well at getting off the stains on my skin from color touch ups.</li>
      <li>There is another product that is offered that is much better and actually removes the dye.</li>
      <li>No stains for real!</li>
      <li>Even with shipping costs, I was able to save money in the long run.</li>
      <li>I will certainly purchase again when needed.</li>
      <li>Please be gentle with your skin</li>
      <li>Have used this product for years, but no longer available at ANY local retail shops.  </li>
      <li>Very efficient in removing dye even after the dye is semi-dried out.</li>
      <li>These work really well</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work .</li>
      <li>Especially since this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s this effective on Manic Panic&#x27;s highly pigmented dyes (namely: Fuchsia Shock, which will turn your whole life pink long after the dyeing process; but I still love it!)  </li>
      <li>Much better than more expensive products.</li>
      <li>and I cannot live without them.</li>
      <li>My old hair dresser used it and when I switched, I bought it for my new gal.  </li>
      <li>So naturally, my skin gets dyed too.  </li>
      <li>Ladies, if you are the type to color your own hair often or just here and there, and tired of trying to get the oops staining on your skin, it happens, this product here does its job.</li>
      <li>However, if you use dark dye, and the stain persists, do not scrub or use much force with these pads.</li>

<li> However, if you use dark dye, and the stain persists, do not scrub or use much force with these pads.</li>
<li> I dye my hair with very concentrated colors of the reds to deep reds and trust me when I say those are definetly hard stubborn stains.</li>
<li> I like how there&#x27;s lots of pads in the container, lasts a long time.&lt;br</li>
<li> this product does not work plus the pads are not soft</li>
<li> so I was anxious to get a new one.  </li>
<li> The thin pads are easy to se, without the mess of those other lotions, etc.</li>
<li> My hair is dyed dark brown and this removes the stain left around my hairline after with no problem.  </li>
<li> Regardless these will dry out unless I keep them in a Baggie or other container.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m curious to see if they stay moist to the end of the jar.  </li>
<li> It looked like a chemical type burn, bled, and ended up scabbing over and looking gross for a few days.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it will work with other types of hair dye (i.e., Henna, metallic-based, etc.)</li>
<li> Hopefully other reviewers will provide info.</li>
<li> I dye my hair black and couldn&#x27;t get all of the dye off, so I pushed down kinda hard and scrubbed, and it took my sensitive skin off too.</li>
<li> and you get a lot in a jar, but my only complaint is the smell.  </li>
<li> I have pale skin and use dark brown hair color.  </li>
<li> The wipes.... don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> After she visited a few weeks ago, I had to take my kids to gymnastics with brown dye ALL OVER my neck, ears, and forehead</li>
<li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe, but if you&#x27;ve ever had or been near someone getting a permanent-</li>
<li> It&#x27;s not very strong but still not very pleasant, and it lingers unless you wash it off.  </li>
<li> A small price to pay for something that works</li>
<li> Not sure if it was packaged like this or if it was caused by inadequate packing.</li>
<li> I was disappointed when my local beauty supply store stopped selling the dyzoff.</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t make the same mistake :(</li>
<li> I was hoping to find a product that would help with this awkward look.  </li>
<li> This product smells very bad, but does work to remove hair dye from your skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have a stylist who comes to the house to color my hair, and she always forgets to bring whatever fancy product they use in the salon to remove the dye from my face. After she visited a few weeks ago, I had to take my kids to gymnastics with brown dye ALL OVER my neck, ears, and forehead (but my hair looked great). After reading the positive reviews on this product, I decided to take matters into my own hands and--let me tell you--this stuff WORKS. Here&#x27;s the caveat: make sure you don&#x27;t try to wash the dye off with water/soap/etc. before you use the pads. They work best when you rub the pads on dyed skin soon after the dye has been applied. I know this product works on Goldwell products (it&#x27;s the only brand she&#x27;ll use), which you can buy on Amazon.com and apply yourself if you have the time/know-how, but I don&#x27;t know if it will work with other types of hair dye (i.e., Henna, metallic-based, etc.) Hopefully other reviewers will provide info.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years, but no longer available at ANY local retail shops.  Happy to find it online.  After coloring my own hair, there is always color on my skin around the eyebrows (which I use the hair color on), and around the forehead hairline.  This removes it nicely and neatly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Nothing works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Good seller too.  Packing was excellent and shipped fast.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when my local beauty supply store stopped selling the dyzoff. They had a substitute product that would have cost quite a bit more! I was delighted to find my product online at a reasonable price. No problems with the ordering process and delivery was as promised. Even with shipping costs, I was able to save money in the long run. I will certainly purchase again when needed.</li>
    <li> My hair is dyed dark brown and this removes the stain left around my hairline after with no problem.  It also removes self tanning stains at the elbows and feet.</li>
    <li> These work really well and you get a lot in a jar, but my only complaint is the smell.  It&#x27;s difficult to describe, but if you&#x27;ve ever had or been near someone getting a permanent- that&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s not very strong but still not very pleasant, and it lingers unless you wash it off.  A small price to pay for something that works, I think.  Especially since this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that&#x27;s this effective on Manic Panic&#x27;s highly pigmented dyes (namely: Fuchsia Shock, which will turn your whole life pink long after the dyeing process; but I still love it!)  I would love to see a version of this that&#x27;s just the liquid form so I can apply it to my own cotton rounds, as these are VERY saturated, which is good value-wise, but I feel like I could get more out of it if I could control the amount.</li>
    <li> The scent of this product is strong.  Could not get over that and the fact that it took multiple pads to fade the dye on my skin.  There is another product that is offered that is much better and actually removes the dye.</li>
    <li> this product does not work plus the pads are not soft so why would you apply it to your face</li>
    <li> I dye my hair every three weeks.  In order for it to look somewhat natural, I have to dye the baby fine hair that frames my face.  So naturally, my skin gets dyed too.  I was hoping to find a product that would help with this awkward look.  This is not that product.  Please note, that using petroleum jelly on my hairline does protect the skin, but also protects the hair.&lt;br /&gt;And, ugh, they STINK!</li>
    <li> Great product! Removes hair color from skin thoroughly!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these were discontinued at the supply store. They are wonderful. The wipes.... don&#x27;t waste your money. But the pads are wonderful!</li>
    <li> Best product ever! No stains for real!</li>
    <li> I have been using these pads for years and I cannot live without them. I die my own eyebrows and with these pads I can do a fantastic job removing any remnants of the die off my skin. They are truly fantastic. I even got my mom hooked on them. She loves them too. What a value for the money!</li>
    <li> I dye my eyebrows (I&#x27;m quite fair) and thus I always have to deal with huge Groucho Marx eyebrows for a day or two due to the fact that my skin gets dyed along with the eyebrow hairs.

    <li> Ladies, if you are the type to color your own hair often or just here and there, and tired of trying to get the oops staining on your skin, it happens, this product here does its job. So scrubbing necessary at all. Works great. I dye my hair with very concentrated colors of the reds to deep reds and trust me when I say those are definetly hard stubborn stains. This product here lasts and works like magic. Totally will recommend.</li>
    <li> Works as well as the ones I used to buy at the salon but much better price.  Haven&#x27;t finished the container yet - there are a lot.  I&#x27;m curious to see if they stay moist to the end of the jar.  If so, I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> Very efficient in removing dye even after the dye is semi-dried out. Wish the smell of the pads would be a bit more pleasant</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  Every stain came off even after 30 minutes.  Very handy instead of using cotton balls and some cream.</li>
    <li> Received this with a big hole and crack in the lid. Not sure if it was packaged like this or if it was caused by inadequate packing. Regardless these will dry out unless I keep them in a Baggie or other container.</li>
    <li> these work great. I have pale skin and use dark brown hair color.  these clean up the skin nicely every time.</li>
    <li> I like how there&#x27;s lots of pads in the container, lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty well at getting off the stains on my skin from color touch ups.</li>
    <li> If you home dye your hair this should be the only dye remover you should ever consider for the rest of your life.  Thank God I found it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted, thank you!</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work .</li>
    <li> Works just great to remove color .</li>
    <li> Works good. very STRONG smell!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff but so does my dog ---- go got a hold of my last container and tore it up so I was anxious to get a new one.  Well, no sooner did I order it, did I receive it.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This removes stray air dye from your skin to easily! Much better than more expensive products. The thin pads are easy to se, without the mess of those other lotions, etc.</li>
