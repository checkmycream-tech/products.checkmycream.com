      <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
      <li>I was expecting the true beauty blender</li>

      <li>Overall, for the price, I was pretty pleased.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like make up sponges...until I found this one!</li>
      <li>It is so soft and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend the Bold Beauty brand.</li>
      <li>It is soft, easy to use on all of the angles of the face, and really does blend those make up lines.</li>
      <li>Gives a nice, even, dewy finish, and I think I use less of my make-up than I would with a brush</li>
      <li>Soak it in some water and youre ready to go.</li>
      <li>Frankly I love Boldwear&#x27;s beauty blending sponge cause of the size, shape, feel and let&#x27;s not forget the color pink.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s fast to use.  </li>
      <li>This is nothing like the real beauty blender.</li>
      <li>LADY&#x27;S IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE THE REAL B.B, LADY&#x27;S</li>
      <li>bought this pink blending sponge for my daughter as a Christmas stocking gift and know she will love it too.</li>
      <li>always seem to need things yesterday so the fast delivery is a real boon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the perky pink color.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend the beauty blender!</li>
      <li>It is not as soft when wet and doesn&#x27;t apply foundation as nice as some others I have found.</li>
      <li>Its a decent size and the droplet shape allows me to get in the creases of my eyes and nose.</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>when applying makeup, it&#x27;s very soft on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I love the way my makeup looks everyday!</li>
      <li>Another advantage is that I&#x27;m able to use less foundation,  yet I get the same coverage when I used triangle sponges or my fingers.</li>
      <li>but if you are looking for one that is soft</li>
      <li>This beauty blender really lasted for a very long time.</li>
      <li>It gives you a fresh medium coverage look with half the foundation!</li>
      <li>my skin is very oily and i thought hmm maybe if i use less foundation it would help and it did.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not a makeup tool I couldn&#x27;t live without...</li>

    <li> I received my blender sponge just a few days after ordering! I love it so much. It&#x27;s the perfect texture and shape to apply foundation smoothly for an even look. Great product! Great seller!</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is extraordinary.  It is so easy to use and makes my foundation look like silk on my face.

Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this wonderful makeup sponge!</li>

    <li> This is nothing like the real beauty blender. It is very hard and feels rough on the face. It soaks up almost all of your foundation and you ending up wasting tons of product. It makes the application of makeup painful and long.</li>
    <li> i have tried the knock off products, and they are simply inferior products. this sponge blends beautifully and feels so nice on your skin! i would highly recommend the beauty blender!</li>
    <li> Its very good and I use it everyday. It makes my face smooth and helps me put on my cc cream easily😊😊</li>
    <li> What a surprise this oddly shaped sponge works like a dream.  I was at my wit&#x27;s end trying to find a good makeup sponge.  I hated using a brush.  This makes it easy and fast.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Not authentic. Very hard and doesn&#x27;t blend well at all! I&#x27;ll stick to my blending brush. This just smears my foundation. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a few times but find that it delivers what it says it will.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean and a fun color!  Trish was quick to deliver it and follow-up with me on how well I like the product.  Will I buy from her again? Yes, if there is a product that I need.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t imagine applying my makeup without this doohickey!</li>
    <li> While I&#x27;m not too excited that I&#x27;m using three times the amount of product I use when I apply it with my fingers, I love the &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look it gives. Stains easy, but that isn&#x27;t an issue. Overall, for the price, I was pretty pleased.</li>

    <li> This sponge is one I thought would be comparable to the beauty sponge. It is not as soft when wet and doesn&#x27;t apply foundation as nice as some others I have found. It is okay but if you are looking for one that is soft~keep looking.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed when I received this bc it wasn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; beauty blender...the beauty blender I had before was softer and easier to clean....but it still does the job, I only gave it 2 stars bc I was expecting the true beauty blender</li>
    <li> This applicator provides great coverage without the caked on look. Flawless coverage and easy to use. Wish I had found it sooner.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup but I do use a mineral powder concealer/foundation to help with the dark circles and blemishes.  Love the feel of the sponge on my face.  Nice and soft.  The tip works perfect for getting the powder under my eyes and around the nose.  The shape of the sponge fits your jaw line so nicely that it doesn&#x27;t leave lines.</li>
    <li> Very nice!! Perfect blend</li>
    <li> Just what I needed!!!</li>
    <li> I call this my happy sponge.  It makes me so happy to use it since it is so fantastic.  I love the perky pink color. It is so soft and comfortable to use. My makeup looks totally awesome now.  This sponge helps create the perfect natural look and it&#x27;s fast to use.  Wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always seem to need things yesterday so the fast delivery is a real boon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t let your dog mistake it for a toy...</li>
    <li> I highly recommend the Bold Beauty brand. Weeks ago I bought their blue blending sponge and use it every day to apply my makeup. Application is easy and my makeup goes on smoothly. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and maintains its shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this pink blending sponge for my daughter as a Christmas stocking gift and know she will love it too. Pink is her favorite color! It comes in cute packaging with extra bonuses on how to best use it and is the same high quality as their other product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can put your trust in Bold Beauty. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I end up buying a fake beauty blender and I know that was not the pic b4</li>
    <li> LADY&#x27;S IF YOU DON&#x27;T HAVE THE REAL B.B, LADY&#x27;S FYI YOU  HAVE TO GET ONE NOT THE CHEAP ONE&#x27;S. I AM TELLING YOU IT&#x27;S NOT THE SAME THIS THING RIGHT HERE IS IT .AND IT ALSO LAST&#x27;S A LONG TIME JUST KEEP IT CLEAN I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I saw so many people talking about the beauty blender on YouTube and figured I would try it out.  I&#x27;ve only used it one time and that was when go-to foundation brush was dirty.  I love the beauty blender as a sub for foundation when I don&#x27;t have a brush but I do not like it for concealer.  I just felt that it took most of my concealer off.  I&#x27;ll give it another try for sure.  I do love the feel of it on my skin because of it&#x27;s dampness when applying makeup, it&#x27;s very soft on the skin.  All in all, I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Have tried using this sponge a couple different ways: dry, damp (as suggested) and with a layer of makeup on it...  honestly I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference between using it, and just using my fingers to blend my makeup.  Not sure what the big hype is about these, but it&#x27;s certainly not a makeup tool I couldn&#x27;t live without...</li>
    <li> Im not the makeup expert but this does the trick. Soak it in some water and youre ready to go. Its a decent size and the droplet shape allows me to get in the creases of my eyes and nose. Just be gentle when cleaning it!:)</li>
    <li> this is a great product for the value. It works wonders and is an amazing product. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice and cheap. This beauty blender really lasted for a very long time. I recommend this and I also plan on purchasing it again. It was worth the price. It blends my make-up so well, especially when a little dampened.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had the name brand beauty blender, but got this as an intended dupe and because with Prime it was a great price. Works well for me. I soak it, wring it out,  put a dab of my liquid foundation on my hand and then dip the sponge in and pat it on to my skin. Gives a nice, even, dewy finish, and I think I use less of my make-up than I would with a brush or when I used to use my fingers. I also use it to apply concealer and primer to my lips and eyes. Cheap and effective. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> If you want your makeup to have that airbrushed look then you need this! It makes things go on amazingly smooth and even.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it everyday when applying my foundation. It&#x27;s so soft, and provides great coverage. The fact that it is so soft combined with the instructions to get it wet with warm water makes it the perfect everyday makeup tool, and gives me the look I want. I love the way my makeup looks everyday!</li>
    <li> Using this sponge makes applying foundation easy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It erases the lines and my face looks fresh and even. Its a great way to apply a smart look.</li>
    <li> Prompt Delivery -&#x27;great product.</li>
