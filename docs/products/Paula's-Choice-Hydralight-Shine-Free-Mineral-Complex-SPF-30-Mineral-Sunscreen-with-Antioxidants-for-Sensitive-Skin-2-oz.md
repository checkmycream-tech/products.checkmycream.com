      <li>Demoting to 4 stars because I tried the Resist Super-Light Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 and like it a lot more.</li>
      <li>and I love that it&#x27;s a mineral sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I really love this sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I also love that it controls the oil that is a huge bonus!</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth with a beautiful finish.  </li>
      <li>Enjoy :) http://goo.gl/J5uNbc</li>
      <li>I have begun to develop rosacea and my skin breaks out easily</li>
      <li>Its extremely light, absorbes quickly and my makeup applies flawlessly over it and last all day.</li>
      <li>My skin is light</li>
      <li>Paula&#x27;.s Choice seems to fit my needs.  </li>
      <li>This actually works great.  </li>
      <li>I was looking for a moisturizer with a higher spf that I could use underneath my makeup that wouldn&#x27;t feel greasy or slippery like most sunscreens do.  </li>

      <li>Very pleased so far.</li>
      <li>, I don&#x27;t work for any brands mentioned, just wanted to give my full opinion.</li>
      <li>Gives me adequate sun protection but does not look greasy at all.  </li>
      <li>if you have darker skin (anything darker than Sephora&#x27;s level 2, I guess, which is still pretty light) you may want to follow it up with any sort of tinted product.</li>
      <li>Use this link for $10 off your first purchase, it makes it a steal!- http://goo.gl/38yriL</li>
      <li>Paula&#x27;s Choice Hydralight is the first sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all!  </li>
      <li>Even though it might be slightly pricey ($25) as compared to store available products like Nutrogena and the likes, this is by far a very superior product.</li>
      <li>; this little guy here, however, hasn&#x27;t wreaked any havoc so far, so kudos to PC for yet another excellent product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m currently using this as a warm weather moisturizer/sunscreen.</li>
      <li>I tried all of her sunscreens and this one was my favorite for my sensitive, combo skin.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t ever used anything but drugstore skin care products, but recently upgraded to all Paula&#x27;s Choice and I am loving it.</li>
      <li>Not greasy and soaks right in.</li>
      <li>I also love that it is a physical-only sunscreen, as chemical sunscreens can break down in sunlight and need to be applied more often.</li>
      <li>It lasts a long time, and feels so nice on my face.</li>
      <li>This product is very gentle on my skin.</li>
      <li>The ingredients are simple and safe.</li>
      <li>you want to get $10 off your first Paula&#x27;s Choice product, my referral link is: https://goo.gl/NsTlAi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
      <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>This is my first Paula&#x27;s purchase.  </li>
      <li>but I just don&#x27;t need my SPF to have tint in it as much as I used to when I had acne when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to not do much to my face.</li>
      <li>Make sure to rub it in good because it can leave a thin white cast on darker skin tones.</li>
      <li>It has a higher zinc oxide content (better sun protection), and though the pigment looks dark coming out of the bottle it looked really nice even on my pale skin.</li>
      <li>It goes on pretty densely compared to many creams that come in such packaging and has a whitish tinge due to zinc, so</li>
      <li>So far, my skin seems to really like it.</li>
      <li>It feels light and there is not much scent.</li>
      <li>but I absolutely love it and wear it under my makeup almost everyday in the spring/summer.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see difference, but love how it goes on.</li>
      <li>Like all strong sunscreens, it creates a UV layer over your skin so you will look a little ghosty if you don&#x27;t really blend it into your skin well.</li>
      <li>It does go away over time but this way you can properly prep your face right out the door.</li>
      <li>It provides a satin finish that does live up to its shine-free claim.</li>
      <li>It actually looks nice on my pale skin, but if you have darker skin, you might want to use the &amp;#34;Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
      <li>I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>I use my fingers for my cheeks and forehead but for the crevasses of my face where my pores could show a little more (like my upper lip and around my nose), I use one of my Sigmax Duo brushes to gently blend it in.</li>
      <li>If this is NOT your first time purchasing, you can still activate discount link by using a different device you have NOT used a refer</li>
      <li>This product delivers as far as being matte goes but it made my skin breakout (at age 70 no less!).</li>
      <li>Also gentle enough for sensitive skin types.  </li>
      <li>sometimes if I&#x27;m going for the natural look.</li>
      <li>I did a bunch of research on mineral vs. chemical sunscreens and decided that mineral sunscreens are the way to go for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft without making it look greasy.  </li>
      <li>that is is a natural/zinc SPF without  chemical sunscreen as I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It gives my makeup a slightly dewy finish and appearance of very healthy skin withiut looking like i have an oil slick on my face...</li>
      <li>I unscrew the cap instead of the flip top to prevent the product from congealing and turning hard outside of the tube and inside</li>
      <li>Ever since I recovered from Central Nervous System Lyme Disease, my skin has been very sensitive to any kinds of chemicals, moisturizers and sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it as a daytime moisturizer for people with normal to slightly oily skin.</li>
      <li>I would classify my skin as combination or normal; not very dry (except sometimes in the winter), not very oily.</li>
      <li>but currently I have some pigmentation due to pregnancy, and that&#x27;s where you can really see it.</li>

<li> Plus, many chemical sunscreens mimic estrogen, so it is scary to think of putting them on every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t get annoyingly oily thoughout the day which is also amazing!</li>
<li> This keeps my skin from getting oily throughout the day without feeling dry.</li>
<li> leave white cast on dark skin tones (from Titanium and Zinc Oxide)&lt;br /&gt;Slightly</li>
<li> If I want a little tint, I mix in a little Lush Dark Yellow Color Supplement for my skin tone.</li>
<li> but should last a few months&lt;br</li>
<li> I had never heard of the brand before, but I decided to try it based on the other reviews.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I used to not do much to my face. When I decided to have a face routine I did my research and ended up buying a bunch of Paula&#x27;s Choice products. I am SO happy I did. For all of those who want to start an affordable and very effective face routine here is a link for $10 OFF your first Paula&#x27;s Choice online order: http://goo.gl/J5uNbc) Customer Service is also great and they helped me pick this better SPF for my skin type. Enjoy :) http://goo.gl/J5uNbc</li>
    <li> Feels amazing on the skin. Not greasy and soaks right in. Gives the SPF I need. Great product and fun to use.</li>
    <li> I needed a sunscreen/moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my skin shinny and greasy.  Tried a few others but they all made me look greasy. Paula&#x27;.s Choice seems to fit my needs.  Gives me adequate sun protection but does not look greasy at all.  I will stick with this brand.  I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have VERY sensitive acne prone skin. This product has been the ONLY facial sunblock that hasnt resulted in a massive erruption of acne or irritated it with redness, a rash or clogged pores. Its extremely light, absorbes quickly and my makeup applies flawlessly over it and last all day. In fact! It gives my makeup a slightly dewy finish and appearance of very healthy skin withiut looking like i have an oil slick on my face...Definitely a keeper!</li>
    <li> This is my first Paula&#x27;s purchase.  It goes on a bit sticky, then absorbs into the skin in a minute. No greasy feel, no white shine on the skin. I use mineral powder for my base over the SPF. I just use a dime size amount for my face and throat area.  I like that is is a natural/zinc SPF without  chemical sunscreen as I have sensitive skin. Good size for travel.  Very pleased so far.</li>
    <li> Very good light, yet moisturizing matte sunscreen with antioxidants for anti-aging benefits! Make sure to rub it in good because it can leave a thin white cast on darker skin tones. It will disappear though after a few mins. Layers great under makeup! Good for acne prone or combination skin! For $10 off your first purchase (when you spend at least $15 on anything including skincare, samples, makeup, and tools), click here https://goo.gl/D1bkph to buy direct from the Paula&#x27;s Choice website. If this is NOT your first time purchasing, you can still activate discount link by using a different device you have NOT used a refer a friend link before while ordering and not logging into your PC account prior to and during ordering (checkout as a guest). Hope this helps and happy shopping!</li>
    <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth with a beautiful finish.  I have used the moisturizer for several weeks now, and my skin looks like I have had regular facials. Love it!</li>
    <li> I would classify my skin as combination or normal; not very dry (except sometimes in the winter), not very oily. I&#x27;m currently using this as a warm weather moisturizer/sunscreen. In the winter I use a heavier moisturizer. I mainly use this for sun protection purposes since my skin isn&#x27;t as dried out in the Spring/Summer. It is an excellent sunscreen, and lightly moisturizes without adding any heaviness, grease, or oiliness to my skin. I highly recommend it as a daytime moisturizer for people with normal to slightly oily skin.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t ever used anything but drugstore skin care products, but recently upgraded to all Paula&#x27;s Choice and I am loving it. I tried all of her sunscreens and this one was my favorite for my sensitive, combo skin. Customer service told me that it was more for oily skin than combo skin (if you have any drier areas), but I find that it&#x27;s the perfect moisturizer for summer and I love that it&#x27;s a mineral sunscreen. I did a bunch of research on mineral vs. chemical sunscreens and decided that mineral sunscreens are the way to go for my sensitive skin. No burning and looks great under my makeup! I use it everyday. Use this link for $10 off your first purchase, it makes it a steal!- http://goo.gl/38yriL</li>
    <li> I really love this sunscreen. Ever since I recovered from Central Nervous System Lyme Disease, my skin has been very sensitive to any kinds of chemicals, moisturizers and sunscreens.  I tried many brands of sunscreens for my face and always ended up with &amp;#34;prickly skin&amp;#34;.  Paula&#x27;s Choice Hydralight is the first sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all!  It also keeps me from burning in the sunshine.  It takes a few minutes to really absorb but I absolutely love it and wear it under my makeup almost everyday in the spring/summer.</li>
    <li> This product delivers as far as being matte goes but it made my skin breakout (at age 70 no less!). When I did an ingredient check it does contain two ingredients that are comedogenic ((algae extract and Glyceryl stearate.)</li>
    <li> Lightweight moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have any funky smell. It provides a satin finish that does live up to its shine-free claim. It doesn&#x27;t get annoyingly oily thoughout the day which is also amazing!</li>
    <li> This is now my every day go to. If I want a little tint, I mix in a little Lush Dark Yellow Color Supplement for my skin tone. It is silky and matte just like it promises. Like all strong sunscreens, it creates a UV layer over your skin so you will look a little ghosty if you don&#x27;t really blend it into your skin well. I use my fingers for my cheeks and forehead but for the crevasses of my face where my pores could show a little more (like my upper lip and around my nose), I use one of my Sigmax Duo brushes to gently blend it in. You should probably use a bronzer for your hairline and chin because it does have that color change UV layer. It does go away over time but this way you can properly prep your face right out the door. I&#x27;m not a makeup artist or anything but just wanted to share how I use it so us ladies can continue to look radiant with this awesome sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently been cutting back on makeup so I use this to replace my Bobbi Brown TM which I have used religiously for several years. I still love the Bobbi Brown TM texture but this is just more affordable and I can wear it alone without any tint sometimes if I&#x27;m going for the natural look. The Bobbi Brown TM is still amazing but I just don&#x27;t need my SPF to have tint in it as much as I used to when I had acne when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t work for any brands mentioned, just wanted to give my full opinion.</li>
    <li> One of the few products that doesn&#x27;t make my face break out in sweat immediately after application. I wonder what the secret ingredient is! It goes on pretty densely compared to many creams that come in such packaging and has a whitish tinge due to zinc, so if you have darker skin (anything darker than Sephora&#x27;s level 2, I guess, which is still pretty light) you may want to follow it up with any sort of tinted product. My skin is light but currently I have some pigmentation due to pregnancy, and that&#x27;s where you can really see it. However, the skin absorbs it in an hour or so and the white tint is gone. Otherwise, I really love it. I have begun to develop rosacea and my skin breaks out easily; this little guy here, however, hasn&#x27;t wreaked any havoc so far, so kudos to PC for yet another excellent product.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a moisturizer with a higher spf that I could use underneath my makeup that wouldn&#x27;t feel greasy or slippery like most sunscreens do.  This was exactly what I was looking for.  The formulation is perfect.  It&#x27;s smooth, lightweight, and hydrates enough to provide a smooth base for makeup application.  Also gentle enough for sensitive skin types.  Going to be repurchasing this without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Truly lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Feels good on skin&lt;br /&gt;Non-irritating&lt;br /&gt;Physical sunscreen - does not require reapplication every 2 hours if not sweating or swimming (from Titanium and Zinc Oxide)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can leave white cast on dark skin tones (from Titanium and Zinc Oxide)&lt;br /&gt;Slightly greasy&lt;br /&gt;Leaves slight shine on face - not matte&lt;br /&gt;Pricey, but should last a few months&lt;br /&gt;There is a space on the inside of the cap between the tube and the cap. I unscrew the cap instead of the flip top to prevent the product from congealing and turning hard outside of the tube and inside the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend and will repurchase.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t heap enough praise for this product. Even though it might be slightly pricey ($25) as compared to store available products like Nutrogena and the likes, this is by far a very superior product. Doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling and cause breakouts. Repeat shopper here!</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and I usually wear coconut oil in the winter. I still do the oil at night before bed but I now wear this under my makeup before I go outside during the warmer months. It feels light and there is not much scent. So far, my skin seems to really like it. W</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see difference, but love how it goes on.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I had never heard of the brand before, but I decided to try it based on the other reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad that I did.  It leaves my skin soft without making it look greasy.  I sometimes mix it in my palm with a little bit of my CC cream to get a sun-kissed glow..  (My CC cream alone is too dark for my pale skin.)  This lotion has become one of my daytime staples.</li>
    <li> Perfect for everyday use! Light-weight, and protects my skin. It lasts a long time, and feels so nice on my face. I&#x27;ve even used it on my shoulders when walking around festivals or just a casual stroll. I pair it with bare minerals make-up, and it works perfectly! Doesn&#x27;t feel cakey with make-up, and keeps your skin feeling and looking hydrated. Great product!</li>
    <li> this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve  used with sunscreen in it. The ingredients are simple and safe. I also love that it controls the oil that is a huge bonus!</li>
    <li> This product is very gentle on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my rosecea, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements in my skin either.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and have had a challenge finding a product with sunscreen I can use and not have more breakouts.  This actually works great.  I like this product.  I am confident in the sunscreen protection, good moisturizer without a greasy feel. I recommend you take a chance on it if you are thinking about it.</li>
    <li> This keeps my skin from getting oily throughout the day without feeling dry.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this sunscreen! It doesn&#x27;t break out my oily, acne-prone skin, even when I wear it every day. I also love that it is a physical-only sunscreen, as chemical sunscreens can break down in sunlight and need to be applied more often. Plus, many chemical sunscreens mimic estrogen, so it is scary to think of putting them on every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish this sunscreen were a bit more moisturizing. Also, it leaves a very faint white cast. It actually looks nice on my pale skin, but if you have darker skin, you might want to use the &amp;#34;Paula&#x27;s Choice Resist Super-Light Daily Wrinkle Defense.&amp;#34; It is a similar sunscreen but with some tint to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to get $10 off your first Paula&#x27;s Choice product, my referral link is: https://goo.gl/NsTlAi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Demoting to 4 stars because I tried the Resist Super-Light Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 and like it a lot more. It has a higher zinc oxide content (better sun protection), and though the pigment looks dark coming out of the bottle it looked really nice even on my pale skin.</li>
