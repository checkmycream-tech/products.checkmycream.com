      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I love this dryer.</li>
      <li>Soooooo wonderful and quiet!</li>
      <li>Love this hairdryer</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything impressive about the dryer, compared to any other, so it&#x27;s on</li>
      <li>This is the best money I have ever spent on a hair dryer!</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t THAT compact for easy traveling.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s compact and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Not as strong (if that&#x27;s the word) as some hair dryers out there</li>
      <li>Light weight and easy to handle.  </li>
      <li>I found the controls on the handle just fine.  </li>
      <li>This is a great hair dryer, especially for the price.  </li>
      <li>Like all John Frieda products, fabulous.</li>
      <li>I immediately went online and ordered one, and later did a happy dance when it arrived.</li>
      <li>so it just fits in my dryer stand, but it does fit.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it dries hair great, and is easy to clean the dust from air intake at back of dryer  via a swing-down door .</li>
      <li>all i did was change the dryer to this one from a really cheap walmart one.</li>
      <li>My favorite part about it is that it has a really strong blower without too much heat.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay--nothing special.</li>
      <li>no matter how wet, the performance is great.</li>
      <li>Great overall, works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to, but</li>
      <li>This Hair drier is really good to use daily.</li>
      <li>I bought this dryer because the description stated that it has a self locking cool shot button.  </li>
      <li>Love this so much</li>
      <li>Smooth hair, fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Just super</li>
      <li>loved my first john freida dryer that I bought a second one for our vacation home!</li>
      <li>Makes drying fast and easy.</li>
      <li>Although powerful, it is the quietest hair dryer I have ever bought.</li>
      <li>Defiantly worth the money.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the same obnoxious sound as most hair dryers do.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and powerful.</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, yet powerful.  </li>
      <li>It is fast at drying my hair, and the medium, high and low speeds are great for styling.</li>
      <li>But this dryer gets it exactly right.</li>
      <li>Works the same as most hair dryers I&#x27;ve gone through.</li>
      <li>If I need more heat, the attachment concentrates the air enough to provide what I need.</li>
      <li>This was more than likely my fault.  </li>
      <li>Works great and dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer.  </li>
      <li>It is very light weight and is small for easy storage.  </li>
      <li>Love the cool down feature.</li>
      <li>It does not blow it away from the brush, yet the high speed is plenty powerful.  </li>
      <li>REALLY gives you &amp;#34;salon hair&amp;#34;, which amazed me the first time I used it at a friends house.</li>
      <li>The nose is not as long as most</li>
      <li>The sound is softer than most dryers, and does not have that shrill sound a portable dryer gives off.</li>
      <li>and I have alot of hair where the hair dressers love it when I come and have it pre-blow dryied for them because it takes them forever to dry my hair for a cut.</li>
      <li>Heat is very even and steady.  </li>
      <li>This one gets nowhere near as hot and doesn&#x27;t make them cover their ears while drying.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, fairly quiet, and has a cool shot button.</li>
      <li>This dryier dries my hair quickly and relatively quietly.  </li>
      <li>not 5/5 because I was particularly looking for portability.</li>
      <li>your research and an extra 5 bucks is worth paying over this.</li>
      <li>I recommend this dryer highly to anyone needing a new hair dryer, It exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>I wanted to buy my own but thought here&#x27;s had to be a fluke of some kind.l would never get the same, but l ordered it none the less.</li>
      <li>The low air speed is just right to style your hair with a brush.  </li>
      <li>When in the market for a new hairdryer, I looked around and read reviews.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to buy my daughter a new blow dryer for Xmas.</li>
      <li>It is much quieter than my last dryer which my husband really appreciates.</li>
      <li>I was excited to not have to hold the button down for 5 minutes while setting my style.</li>
      <li>She came out in about ten minutes and l wasn&#x27;t paying too much attention.</li>
      <li>Our hair drys faster than the old Revelon we have, which I packed up &amp; put away.</li>
      <li>It feels really professional.</li>
      <li>Their hair is wonderfully soft now</li>
      <li>other annoyance is that the concentrator attachment is designed with holes in that blow hot air into your face (or wherever else they&#x27;re facing).</li>
      <li>The dryer itself works alright, but no better than my older one that I bought years ago...for much cheaper.  </li>
      <li>In fact, my old one actually dried my hair much quicker.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Way too big.  This was more than likely my fault.  Anyone know a small 2 speed dryer?</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!  It is lightweight, quiet, and dries my short but very thick hair quickly.  I have never written an Amazon review before, but I bought this based on the reviews I read - so wanted to add my comments.  Great price also!!!</li>
    <li> Love this so much I just bought one for my mom!</li>
    <li> Best hairdryer I&#x27;ve had in years.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay--nothing special. Works the same as most hair dryers I&#x27;ve gone through. The last one I had was a Revlon. I&#x27;ll continue using this one until it, too, burns out.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Heat is very even and steady.  It feels really professional.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair dryer! Love the cool down feature. Just super</li>
    <li> Very light weight. Looks very nice. The only negative thing is that it feels a little under-powered. It takes longer for me to dry my hair with this blow dryer compared to my old one.</li>
    <li> By far, this is the best Hair Dryer I have ever had!  It dries my hair in less time and it gives my hair a shine I haven&#x27;t seen in a long time!</li>
    <li> Love this hairdryer I bought 2!</li>
    <li> YOU will LOVE this hair dryer! Although powerful, it is the quietest hair dryer I have ever bought. It doesn&#x27;t have the same obnoxious sound as most hair dryers do. It drys my hair in just a few minutes no matter how wet, the performance is great. The nose is not as long as most so it just fits in my dryer stand, but it does fit. I recommend this dryer highly to anyone needing a new hair dryer, It exceeded my expectations.</li>
    <li> Really good hair dryer! I didnt have any issues with the buttons being in an awkward position like the other reviews say.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that a hairdryer could make my hair look so good.  It is fast at drying my hair, and the medium, high and low speeds are great for styling.This is the best money I have ever spent on a hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Love this hair dryer. Lightweight and powerful. Makes drying fast and easy. I am so glad I choose the smaller of the two JF a dryers as it&#x27;s perfect size for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this dryer. It is lightweight and compact, so it fits nicely in my drawer. It is much quieter than my last dryer which my husband really appreciates. My favorite part about it is that it has a really strong blower without too much heat. If I need more heat, the attachment concentrates the air enough to provide what I need. With my past dryer, I always felt like it was way too hot on the highest setting but not hot enough on the lower one. But this dryer gets it exactly right.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy my daughter a new blow dryer for Xmas. I researched and ended up buying the John Frieda 1875 watt one. One of the things that it claimed was it would cut your blow drying hair time in half. I took this with a grain of salt. When she got it and tried it for the first time she has very thick long hair which usually takes an hour to dry. She came out in about ten minutes and l wasn&#x27;t paying too much attention. Never did l think she would tell me her hair was dry. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. So l tried it and it did the same for me. I wanted to buy my own but thought here&#x27;s had to be a fluke of some kind.l would never get the same, but l ordered it none the less. When it came, l was expecting the worse, but it did the same thing! I have had it and use it all the time, it dries my hair in no time, keeps it shiny and not frizzy. This is truly an amazing product and l have been telling all my friends about it. Don&#x27;t think twice, you will love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this blow dryer at my mother inlaws and LOVED it.  I found it dried my hair fast and I have alot of hair where the hair dressers love it when I come and have it pre-blow dryied for them because it takes them forever to dry my hair for a cut. This blow dryer somehow makes my hair feel healthier because I guess the design.  Defiantly worth the money. You can get it at walmart too.</li>
    <li> We have 3 of these dryers. One for me, one for my daughter, and one to travel with! It&#x27;s compact and easy to use. The settings are perfect and doesn&#x27;t cause hair breakage. Before I ordered the additional 2, someone in my family traveled with the only 1 we had so I used a different dryer. The breakage was awful. I&#x27;m now dealing with regrowth. It was at that point that I ordered the other 2!</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer!  It&#x27;s lightweight, fairly quiet, and has a cool shot button.</li>
    <li> I love this dryer. Smooth hair, fast and easy.</li>
    <li> Love it, love it, love it!</li>
    <li> Died within 6 months. What else is there to say other than a product that fails in such a short timeframe is&lt;br /&gt;clearly garbage.</li>
    <li> Like the settings on this dryer, , does well on my hair</li>
    <li> With long, thick, curly hair, I&#x27;ve been in search of a blow dryer that could BOTH dry my hair quickly and straighten it for a long time. This blow dryer REALLY gives you &amp;#34;salon hair&amp;#34;, which amazed me the first time I used it at a friends house. I immediately went online and ordered one, and later did a happy dance when it arrived.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hairdryer.  Light weight and easy to handle.  Does not dry my hair out like other dryers I have had.  Purchased one for my daughter as well and she is thrilled with it!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer because the description stated that it has a self locking cool shot button.  Cool shot is a great way to lock in curl and shine. I was excited to not have to hold the button down for 5 minutes while setting my style. Unfortunately the cool shot doesn&#x27;t lock.  Doesn&#x27;t know if this is a defective model I got, or if they just don&#x27;t self lock.  I didn&#x27;t find anything impressive about the dryer, compared to any other, so it&#x27;s on it&#x27;s way back.</li>
    <li> When in the market for a new hairdryer, I looked around and read reviews.  This model looked like it would be just what I was looking for, and I have like the other John Frieda products I have purchased.  The dryer itself works alright, but no better than my older one that I bought years ago...for much cheaper.  In fact, my old one actually dried my hair much quicker.  The other thing that drives me crazy is that fact that the buttons are located on the part you hold onto.  So, I am constantly turning it off while I am drying my hair because there is no other place to hang onto it and the buttons are difficult to avoid bumping.  It does the trick I guess, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I&#x27;m overly impressed...</li>
    <li> Soooooo wonderful and quiet! This one is my second one I&#x27;ve bought because I wanted one for travel that could stay packed!</li>
    <li> This dryier dries my hair quickly and relatively quietly.  It is very light weight and is small for easy storage.  Great!</li>
    <li> Works great and dries my hair in half the time of my old dryer.  So glad I choose this dryer!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great except that it&#x27;s not pliable, not so convenient to travel with.</li>
    <li> I love it.  Very strong heat and does actually make my hair shiny!</li>
    <li> My kids hair never came out correctly after drying them it was always hard.  I asked their stylist what i should do.  He told me the hair dryer was the problem.  This one gets nowhere near as hot and doesn&#x27;t make them cover their ears while drying.  Their hair is wonderfully soft now all i did was change the dryer to this one from a really cheap walmart one. This one drys faster too.</li>
    <li> Annoying at times to use because ON/OFF and Temperature setting are RIGHT ON THE HANDLE...just look at the picture. It is also quite heavy. On the plus side, it dries hair great, and is easy to clean the dust from air intake at back of dryer  via a swing-down door . The screen there is quite durable and you can use a tooth brush to just brush away in a few stroke. The sound is softer than most dryers, and does not have that shrill sound a portable dryer gives off. Wish it was lighter.</li>
    <li> Like all John Frieda products, fabulous.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer, especially for the price.  It is lightweight, yet powerful.  The low air speed is just right to style your hair with a brush.  It does not blow it away from the brush, yet the high speed is plenty powerful.  The size is convenient for travel.</li>
    <li> Not as strong (if that&#x27;s the word) as some hair dryers out there but I needed one and it gets the job done. I was also too lazy to return it- if that says anything to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other annoyance is that the concentrator attachment is designed with holes in that blow hot air into your face (or wherever else they&#x27;re facing). I&#x27;ve turned it around but the extra holes blowing air just make it annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your research and an extra 5 bucks is worth paying over this.</li>
    <li> loved my first john freida dryer that I bought a second one for our vacation home!</li>
    <li> I Love this dryer &amp; so does My Son. Our hair drys faster than the old Revelon we have, which I packed up &amp; put away. Love all the settings it has.</li>
    <li> I found the controls on the handle just fine.  very light.</li>
    <li> Great overall, works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to, but not 5/5 because I was particularly looking for portability. This isn&#x27;t THAT compact for easy traveling.</li>
    <li> This Hair drier is really good to use daily. And also it&#x27;s pretty beautiful.</li>
    <li> Received in good condition and works great</li>
