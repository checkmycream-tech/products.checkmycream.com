      <li>anything that promotes better circulation is a&lt;br /&gt;winner.</li>
      <li>I suppose others may have to use different levels of pressure to see what best fits their needs.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use this forever :)</li>
      <li>This is a interesting device, it does what is says it will do.</li>
      <li>Love how it is repairing my skin</li>
      <li>but it seems ok</li>
      <li>but to find something that actually improves my skins condition and appearance is really impressive.</li>
      <li>I have not been using for more than 3 months.</li>
      <li>I used it at night time and made sure I &amp;#34;slathered&amp;#34; my self in night creme afterwards.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>I have to say I will continue to use until I am able to tolerate more pressure.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive to use the product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>

      <li>It’s very reasonably priced and effective once you figure out how to and how often to use it.</li>
      <li>Great product will definitely buy again.</li>
      <li>I will enjoy using this product.</li>
      <li>Overall  extremely happy with the results.</li>
      <li>should I get brave enough to try it elsewhere.</li>
      <li>, I use a vitamin c serum after my rolling sessions and my skin feels great the next morning!</li>
      <li>It is nice to find it for a very affordable price compared to some others I have seen online.</li>
      <li>After using it twice a week, i haven&#x27;t any significant or insignificant changes.</li>
      <li>I have to use it for a longer period of time, to get the full benefit.</li>
      <li>It comes in a nice plastic case, for which it is easy to store the cleaned roller for next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I apply mild pressure.</li>
      <li>I am impressed that this has its own storage holder so it won&#x27;t get dirty when not in use.  </li>
      <li>I believe in this roller and have been using it several times and am very pleased with the results.</li>
      <li>liked it so much, I am considering ordering one in a smaller size for more every day use.</li>
      <li>it feels pretty nice actually.  </li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It comes with a hard case which is great for the sake of safety, as I would not want to step on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>First, the price of this Derma-Roller is a fraction of what they charge on the infomercials.  </li>
      <li>The difference is noticeable after the first use.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>My first thought was &amp;</li>
      <li>This is the first derma roller I have used.</li>
      <li>This made a difference the first time that I used it.</li>
      <li>The quality of this Dermaroller is first rate.</li>
      <li>Now it feels smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>Very well made!</li>
      <li>My skin was positively glowing the day after.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it 4 times so far, and although I don&#x27;t yet see fine line reduction, I feel an elasticity reforming that is new.</li>
      <li>However, I&#x27;ve learned if you are on blood thinners that this really isn&#x27;t the tool for you.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I got this item in the sme timely manner as (almost) always from Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;I  have only barely tried it yet.. going to take some getting used to I think!!&lt;br /&gt;The idea is a good one ~~ anything that promotes better circulation is a&lt;br /&gt;winner. Maybe check back in about a month..?.. and see if I have had the&lt;br /&gt;time to give it and my face it will take to give it a fair shake.....&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!</li>
    <li> love this! i have used it for about a week now and my red lining has shaded to a pink. it does irritate skin just remember to moisturize before and after.</li>
    <li> Ordered the Derma-Roller 1.0mm.Got the product delivered in 2 days ... The make and quality is great ... I have been using this for 2 weeks ... Seems to be working for the purpose ... Would definitely recommend this one...</li>
    <li> i love it. It is easy to use and is pain free,which I was worried about when I ordered it. THANKS</li>
    <li> Nice way to remove imperfections</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my son and he loves it, his scarring is almost gone..</li>
    <li> I just recently got my derma rollers in the mail. Have tried them twice. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing great results! Not sure what to expect and not sure If it will replace a face lift...high hopes!</li>
    <li> I was apprehensive to use the product, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. Have used it a few times and already noticing a difference. Great product will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> The quality of this Dermaroller is first rate. Additionally, I have used it 2x in 6weeks and I have seen a 70% improvement. Will be ordering the 1.5 next.</li>
    <li> Purchased this to try and am very disappointed.  I have used it several times and have not noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> This just takes some getting used to.  I have only used it a few times and it takes a few times to get used to the tingling sensation.  I have been using it on one spot just to see if there will be any difference after using it and then adding my moisturizer.  Very quickly shipped.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I was a little leary of using this derma-roller on my face. I really love the roller and the results!  I use it only once a week.  After use at night, I put a heavy moisterizer on my face.  In the morning, my skin is soft and glowing.  I believe in this roller and have been using it several times and am very pleased with the results. Highly recommended!  I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> This is a interesting device, it does what is says it will do. Be careful because it will make ur face bleed if u apply too much pressure.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and noticed that it definitely stimulated my face haven&#x27;t hit my 40 days Where collagen is supposed to repair but it seems ok</li>
    <li> Used for a while. Makes my skin feel younger</li>
    <li> I had no idea what I was getting into when I ordered a dermaroller, and reading reviews from others frightened me a bit! I didn&#x27;t need to use a numbing cream or anything for pain. It only started to get a bit sore by the time I got to the third direction, but it isn&#x27;t unbearable. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times so far, and although I don&#x27;t yet see fine line reduction, I feel an elasticity reforming that is new. I do think in time, I will see more improvement since I&#x27;ve noticed a little already. These things take time. I like it!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical to use this and it turned out not too bad.  I get this tingling feeling on the face.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt.  I think this product is designed to help us absorb whatever skin products we use.</li>
    <li> I was leary of buying this product as I had tried other things did never saw any true results. I was very impressed and happy after using this to see my skin actually changing. I&#x27;m very happy I decided to buy this product. I&#x27;m getting more and more confident in areas of body that I haven&#x27;t been for a while.</li>
    <li> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review. When you open this bad baby up you may feel a little intimidated. My first thought was &amp;#34;this is going to hurt&amp;#34;. It did hurt a little, but no more that any other exfoliation process. The instructions are great for beginners. It comes with a hard case which is great for the sake of safety, as I would not want to step on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after 3 days of use, I am starting to notice my skin is feeling a bit smoother. My pores feel cleaner, but I am noticing that my face also feels dried out. I would recommend that a good moisturizer is used in the morning if you use this at night.  This is more than likely due to the fact that you are supposed to wipe your face with an alcohol wipe before using the derma-roller. All an all, after 3 days I have had some good results. I have only tried it on my face so far, but will update the review should I get brave enough to try it elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Loved it, but it cut the crap out of my legs.</li>
    <li> Great quality roller... Great price...</li>
    <li> Not at all painful to use. Very fast shipping. Very satisfied!</li>
    <li> Great product, love it. Fast shipping</li>
    <li> After using it twice a week, i haven&#x27;t any significant or insignificant changes. The only thing i notice right away is those horizontal, vertical and diagonal marks stay on my skin over 24 hours, and i cannot go out to see anybody with a look like that.</li>
    <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
    <li> I AM HOPING THIS WORKS FOR MY NECK</li>
    <li> Nice roller! Very well made!</li>
    <li> I have only used this derma roller a couple of time. I used it at night time and made sure I &amp;#34;slathered&amp;#34; my self in night creme afterwards. My skin was positively glowing the day after. I did not put much pressure on the roller, just rolled it gently over my face in several different directions. It was very easy to use and clean. It comes in a nice plastic case, for which it is easy to store the cleaned roller for next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much, I am considering ordering one in a smaller size for more every day use. I only use this roller about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I received this roller discounted in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am very pleased with this product and actually glad I had a chance to try it out. It is nice to find it for a very affordable price compared to some others I have seen online.</li>
    <li> My husband could not figure out why anyone would use a torture device like this. It just looks intimidating,  it feels pretty nice actually.  A slight pain at first as your skin gets used to it, then it just feels stimulated. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time, but my skin has that fresh look going now. I&#x27;m a fan. Cleaning is a pain, I&#x27;m not really sure how to over come that. But otherwise,  this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!! I have only used a couple of times do to having to wait until the skin heels a bit. But I have to say it is definitely working for me. Moisturizer is a MUST after using my skin was a bit dry. Now it feels smooth and soft. The difference is noticeable after the first use. I will continue to use this forever :)</li>
    <li> Works as wells as the expensive ones for a fraction of the cost!</li>
    <li> I love it works as I expected</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE!!! The results have been FANTASTIC! My skin looks and feels amazing!</li>
    <li> This is the first derma roller I have used. I have been using it once a week for three weeks. I apply mild pressure. Even with light/mild pressure i have seen good results. I roll my face and neck. I concentrate more on my neck because I do have some noticeable creases. I follow it with a vitamin C serum. I have to say I will continue to use until I am able to tolerate more pressure. Overall  extremely happy with the results.</li>
    <li> skin feels amazing!! doesn&#x27;t hurt very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Hygienically sealed when arrived.  I am impressed that this has its own storage holder so it won&#x27;t get dirty when not in use.  I will enjoy using this product. Product is well made, seller shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Do not work at all for wrinkle.</li>
    <li> It works.  I didn&#x27;t need any numbing cream.  Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I love this, was nervous in the beginning, but works great.</li>
    <li> Only used once, but seems to work.</li>
    <li> To sum up my experience with the Derma-roller- I saw the price, the claims, and I splurged knowing it may or may not work. I am more than thrilled that I decided to try this roller out. I use it once every other day or so (to allow healing between sessions), so I have only used it a handful of times on deep stretch mark scars. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, honestly. I am thrilled at how this roller after several &#x27;applications&#x27;, has actually &#x27;broken up&#x27; my scar tissue so it isn&#x27;t so deep and defined. It will never go away without crazy expensive surgery, but for this price this rolled is a steal for what it did for my scars. For anyone who knows the deep and purple scars you&#x27;ve come to accept- this will actually reduce the harshness and severity within a month. I can&#x27;t wait to see if my skin condition improves further- as is, I&#x27;m thrilled. the &#x27;depth&#x27; and color has been recuced on scars I&#x27;ve had for over ten years that I had thought I had to accept. I don&#x27;t expect any product or cream to completely eliminate my scars- but to find something that actually improves my skins condition and appearance is really impressive.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and easy to use! I noticed a difference in my skin after 2 uses. I used rose water to calm my skin afterwards.</li>
    <li> I am happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Works very well, my family shares this one that I got to try. (Of course using alcohol to disinfect in between uses.) Will be buying another one in the future.</li>
    <li> I received the product at a promotional price for my unbiased opinion. I have had this product for about a week. I have used it a few times and i have to say the product has given my face a softer feel and look. Highly recommended  this product.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly well!  However, I&#x27;ve learned if you are on blood thinners that this really isn&#x27;t the tool for you.  My face wasn&#x27;t red from the roller...well, perhaps it was...but that was somewhat masked by the hundreds of drops of blood all over my face.</li>
    <li> Have been using for about a week. A little painful at first, bit you get used to it. Be sure to use moisturizing cream after to avoid irritation.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve struck gold with this product.  I just wish I had discovered it sooner!!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. Got mine for a discount also. Came very quickly. Have only used a few times so far but I think im noticing difference with my acne scarring . I would recommend if you want a cheaper derma roller because I think this will work the same as any other. No problems with this .</li>
    <li> Saw nothing that is beneficial in this gadget</li>
    <li> Only seen a bit of a difference  after using it</li>
    <li> So far, I like it very much. only have it a few days. don&#x27;t want to use it every day. my skin looks good. I have to use it for a longer period of time, to get the full benefit.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this item. However it come in an attractive case.</li>
    <li> Good starter roller. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works great! I love it!</li>
    <li> However, after getting past the first few uses I became used to it! I didn’t care for it in the beginning but now I don’t know if I would go without one! It’s very reasonably priced and effective once you figure out how to and how often to use it. I suppose others may have to use different levels of pressure to see what best fits their needs. For me, just some light pressure is all I needed for it to be effective. I’ve read of others saying they rolled till their skin bled, not me! My skin did get pink/reddish but that was all I needed to get the results I was looking for. Hope that helps anyone reading this. Oh I forgot to add, I use a vitamin c serum after my rolling sessions and my skin feels great the next morning!</li>
    <li> This made a difference the first time that I used it. I&#x27;m in love with this !  My best beauty purchase ever !</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t say this works well, ive not noticed any change</li>
    <li> I feel like it helps get my face products to penetrate my skin a lot deeper.  I felt the tingling as I put on products that I normally don&#x27;t feel that on.</li>
    <li> I use this roller on my face once a week. A while back I read it works well on scars, large pores, etc. I love how smooth my skin gets after using it. I also use it on my post- pregnancy  stretch marks. I have seen slight improvement. I have not been using for more than 3 months.</li>
    <li> Started using it , however cuts skins would not recommend it for sensitive skein</li>
    <li> I have been seeing infomercials for a few years for products like this and I have wondered if they really worked....so I decided to give this a try.  First, the price of this Derma-Roller is a fraction of what they charge on the infomercials.  I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I actually like the way it feels using this on my skin.  I do not press very hard - I just go lightly over my skin.  Maybe in time I might press a tad harder, but I am seeing benefits after a few weeks of using this already.  I do just a few quick &#x27;lines&#x27; across my face - I only spend a couple of minutes doing it.  When I am finished with this I go through my morning skin routine.  In time I expect to start using it on some other areas where I have a few scars.  I am very happy with this and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I loved , we all need to have one !</li>
    <li> Love it. Love how it is repairing my skin</li>
    <li> This product seems to be working for me. Didn&#x27;t hurt,  just a little discomfort that is tolerable. I have only used it one time because you have to wait for the skin to heal. My simple go to moisturizers of choice have been Palmers Cocoa Butter stretch mark cream and olive oil. Really sooths and smooths the skin. Overall I will use this product again and possible get another one when time to replace.</li>
