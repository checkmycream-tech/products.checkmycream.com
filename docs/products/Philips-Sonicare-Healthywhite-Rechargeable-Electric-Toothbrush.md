<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love the sonicare toothbrushes! This one was such a good buy online as well!</li>
    <li> Wonderful.  Cannot wait to see what dentist says on next visit!</li>
    <li> Wish the travel case had a built-in UV for sanitation</li>
    <li> Theet never felt and looked so clean</li>
    <li> This is such an improvement from the original one as far as design.  This doesn&#x27;t have the crevices to get dirty with nasty buildup like my old one.  Really like the trimmer design. Still same great sonic cleaning power from the brush.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I absolutely love it!  I actually look forward to brushing my teeth now.  After using it, my teeth feel as clean as if I&#x27;d just had a cleaning at the dentist office.  My dentist recommended a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and I&#x27;m so glad she did.</li>
    <li> this is my second Soniccare, I like them very much</li>
    <li> So far so good, though I do wish there was a choice to use just the whitening mode... I use the sensitive mode on the rest of my teeth, but want to use the extra whitening mode on my front teeth. Seems you have to use the full clean and white setting and go through that whole session to get to the whitening mode.</li>
    <li> We use it and have great dental checkups.</li>
    <li> powerful..  helps a lot to clean teeths</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush. Thought i&#x27;d checkout the hype but it&#x27;s just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Weird one button system which seems not to change speeds easily. They could have made it simpler. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Gentle and highly effective.  Best sonic toothbrush that I ever used.  And so easy to clean!</li>
    <li> Its the old standard. Still perfect. I had a flex-care for about 4 years. Flex is just a gimmick. So are endless settings, which I have tried. This has plenty of settings. There was also a good deal for a pair of these. For about $50 more. Here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> We bought two of these and like a good Philips products they did a good job of cleaning teeth.  However one failed after about 6 months of use and that seems all together too short for the life of an electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> BEST toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned!! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> Brushing my teeth is heavenly...and my teeth are clean as can be.</li>
    <li> Last one lasted over ten years; does a great job at what it&#x27;s meant to do.</li>
    <li> I had previously owned the Sonicare Flex and it broke after four years. Decided not to invest as much in the next one if that is how long it would last. Saw this one which was $50 dollars less than the flex and would work with the recharger and sanitizing unit I had from before. This brush is so much better than the flex. Yes, the flex has more settings and is smaller to grip, but I realized I didn&#x27;t use those settings and the settings on this one would work fine: a clean, a sensitive setting and a clean and whiten setting. I love the clean and whiten setting and yes within two weeks I could see an obvious improvement of more than a few shades. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this toothbrush is that I have to cycle through the settings to get to the one I want. The flex lets you choose the setting first. So if you are looking for a brush that does the job well and is effective at cleaning, consider this one.</li>
    <li> I have had the Phillips brushes for a while now. I bought this version for myself a couple of years ago when the old one croaked. This time, I bought it for my boyfriend who became intrigued by the lengthy and elaborate brushing ritual that I practiced after our dinners. So for starters, I gave him the battery operated version of the sonicare, he pledged that he would keep using it. But this was really the bait because once he tried mine for real, there was no way back. The quality of the work and the immediately noticeable difference in one&#x27;s oral hygiene leaves no decision to be made about using it and loving it. The unit is reliable, easy to use, and does an excellent job. I bought this originally because it has the travel charger. As we travel abroad quite often for extended time, it is important that we can charge it and use it. Which reminds me that it also comes with a travel case, which makes it a very handy everyday necessity.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Yes, this really works.  Fantastic results, works as promised, super lightweight and travels very well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is a now a shady company.  They are purposely building their toothbrushes that do not last.  I purchased two toothbrushes from them, the first stopped working a month after the warranty ended, how nice.  I liked the toothbrush so like fool I went out and spent over another $100 on another.  Guess what, that one too stopped working.  The first one the switch would not work and my second one would just not turn on even though it was fully charged.  So I called the company and told them I was a loyal customer and I had two toothbrushes that stopped working shortly after the warranty expired.  The rep told me too bad and I would just have to buy another one.  Nice comment.  I called a few other times to see if anyone would be sympathetic enough to maybe have it fixed or send me a coupon for a discount on my next and nothing.  I cannot support a company that builds a poorly created product and then does not stand by it.  Please do not waste your hard earned money on this companies products.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. We have 2 in our family. Fast free shipping was great!</li>
    <li> So Great! ive been used for a week and my theeths are whiter and i i feel so clean every day. excelent product! 100% recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used for years and still love it.</li>
    <li> After using an other electric toothbrushes for years I decided to try the Philips brand, with this toothbrush my teeth feel smooth and clean like after leaving the dentists office this if by far the best toothbrush I have ever used. One of the thing is like any battery operated device you should always fully charge and  discharge three or four times to bring the battery to its optimum performance. I would highly recommend this toothbrush</li>
    <li> Great product.  Highly recommended.  I bought my son the Oral B brush, but this one is much better.  This is my second one in 5 years as the first one took one too many tumbles off the granite counter and landed on the head.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Dentist visits are no longer stressful.</li>
    <li> I compared this Sonicare 6731 to the 6921 (see my review of that product as well for a comparison to the Oral-B product). The 6731 has the exact same cleaning speed and can utilize the same brushhead (in fact, these models can use the DiamondClean Brush head that comes with the most expensive Sonicare model, should that be your desire). What&#x27;s missing....you still get the travel case, you still get only one brush head (the ProResults model), and you get the same cleaning ability. So the differences: the induction charger base for the 6731 is smaller and does not hold spare brush heads. I view this as a positive since it takes less counter space. The unit itself does not have quite the range of modes as the 6921. It doesn&#x27;t, for example, have the capability of cleaning at high speed for 2 minutes and then switch to a gum cleaning mode for 1 minute. It does, however, have a 30 second polish addition capability. Frankly, I suspect most people just turn these brushes on, brush their teeth using whatever mode they always use, turn the brush off and call it a day. Sort of like washing machines and dishwashers...if you find yourself using all the modes those products offer, maybe you want the 6921 or better. But if not, save a few bucks and get the 6731. It brushes exceptionally well and your teeth will be clean.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for the past month as a replacement from my old electric toothbrush that finally died (the batteries in these things seem to only be good for 2-3 years and are never replaceable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old one had the larger diameter handle and brushes with a large screw on base and a magnetic induction coupling to the motor. The problem with that style is that there&#x27;s a large volume of space under the base of the brush that fills up with disgusting bacterial slime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I really like the small push-on brush that this one uses, and the slim handle is lighter and more comfortable to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging system is also well done in that you don&#x27;t just leave the brush on the charger stand all the time (although you can). The battery light on the handle will start to blink after a week or so of use and you can then charge it overnight and go for another week without worrying about it. This means the battery is not constantly charging and will probably last a lot longer as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see too much value in the extra \\&quot;modes\\&quot; this brush offers. Sure if you want a more gentle option that&#x27;s there, but the whitening cycle which switches to an extra 20 seconds of a different vibration pattern at the end of the regular brushing cycle seems a bit of a gimmick, but then I can&#x27;t claim to have used it enough to know and maybe it&#x27;s just awesome for whitening your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the different modes (accessed by repeatedly pressing the single button) if you want to turn the brush off in the middle of a cycle you need to hold the button down for  couple seconds. This is actually more annoying than just pressing it a couple times to cycle through the modes back to off which is what I usually do. So the user interface isn&#x27;t all that great, but what can you do with just one button? There are at least separate green LEDs to tell you what mode it&#x27;s in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I have so far found nothing else to complain about, and would have no reservations recommending it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommend I get a electronic toothbrush to help with my sensitive teeth. My husband and I both have the Philips Sonicare and it works the best and lasts the longest. The battery hold it&#x27;s charge for weeks. Great product!</li>
    <li> Worked much better than older Sonicare it replaced.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and cleans braces great</li>
    <li> upgrade from an earlier model i had for years.  it&#x27;s nice--slimmer and lighter and more powerful.  Having used it for a couple months now, diligently utilizing the &#x27;whiten&#x27; mode, I am seeing a noticible difference in my front teeth--not using whitening toothpaste either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brush 1 yr ago, loved it. but this year it broke - stopped charging. I suspect water got inside the battery from everyday use ( I didn&#x27;t plunged it in the water just rinsed it under running water after each use). Also, it has a rubber part right under the replaceable head which got moldy and started to break down after 6months of use. The bottom rubber also became moldy and disgusting. I am going back to Oral-B brash I had prior to this and which served me for years and years.</li>
    <li> A great investment. My teeth are cleaner feeling, my breath is better, my gums don&#x27;t hurt. ... get one.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have the same toothbrush and we love it, he bought his at CVS and bought mine here in Amazon as the special package and it didn&#x27;t come with the DiamondClean brush head and Philips Sonicare whitening pen.</li>
    <li> More powerful &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; than my previous Braun e-toothbrush. Original brush dulls quickly. I bought these as replacement brush heads, &amp;#34;Philips Sonicare HX6066/70 DiamondClean Standard Brush Heads, 6-Pack&amp;#34;, recommended by other reviewers. I&#x27;ll be swapping a replacement in soon, it&#x27;s well overdue after a couple months using the original. I hope the replacements have much better life. The off button is not easy as the Braun, almost difficult to turn off. Overal a good value compare to the very high prices of others these days, for a product that lasts about 5 years before the rechargeable battery becomes too weak to hold a charge for a strong brush buzz..</li>
    <li> I have had this toothbrush for two years now and I gotta say it works really well. It whitened my teeth really well, I used to have very yellow teeth and they are almost perfectly white. You get a very nice clean feeling after you use it. The pulsations actually feel very nice against the teeth and not weird at all. For the price though I would say its not worth it to buy the two mode brush. Its nothing different then their base model which works the same way. The clean and white mode is just a longer timer. Also I have three people who use the brush in my house, and it seems to have enough power. I did have a problem with mold growing around the base where you charge it, but that is because my brother never cleaned it completely. Although I really did not like how that was possible. The brush in itself cleans very well but I would have purchased their base model which is a lot more inexpensive.  The two minute timer is nice and you get a nice beep to know when to move on to the the next part of the mouth. I dont really usr the two minute timer and find myself turning on the brush more then once to completely clean my mouth. But that is my own preference especially because sometimes I feel like I need to clean my mouth more in some places then others. I really do like this bruah and will never go to a manual. Highly recommend phillips sonicare.</li>
    <li> Great, does as advertised. This is my second one as the first one had signs of mold where the toothbrush connects to the core device (I had it for 5+years, and consistently changed the heads every 3 months). I would strongly recommend drying both the head and the core device after brushing your teeth to prolong the life of this (anything with moisture will eventually get gross). I simple remove the head and dry both pieces with a paper towel (takes 5-10 seconds).</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush--I used manual toothbrush for years and this cleans teeth much better and keeps me from brushing my gums away since I use too much force when brushing manually. The only thing I can say that is not better, it doesn&#x27;t clean my tongue as well--for that I bought a tongue scraper.  Great product and would never switch to anything else.</li>
    <li> I have had three different Sonicare models over the years and they just keep getting better.  I like the addition of a 4th and 5th, 15 second whitening cycle. I really see a difference.</li>
    <li> i love my sonicare  would never get any other kind of toothbrush</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  Going from cheap electric toothbrushes to this is a night and day difference.  Brushing my teeth using this Sonicare is a pleasure.  My teeth feel cleaner than ever using this toothbrush.  The quadrant timer is very helpful in getting a full mouth clean, hitting all teeth.  I usually use the whitening setting which is a but more aggressive and longer than the standard setting.  I noticed whiter teeth after less than a week, other people commented as well.  This model does include both a small protective cap for the head and a larger travel hard case for the the head and the handle.  The battery has been lasting me a good 2 weeks between charge, that is using the 2.5min whitening mode twice a day.  I looked at the less expensive and more expensive models of the Sonicare, as well as the Oral-B models.  I avoided the Oral-B models due to lots of crevices and seams in the brush head that would gather gunk very quickly.  The Sonicare brush heads are sealed and have no moving parts.  In my opinion they will stay cleaner for longer.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush! It is my 2nd one!!!</li>
    <li> My Teeth have never felt cleaner.  And don&#x27;t get me started on my gums.  They&#x27;re getting stronger all the time.  Wish I had this years ago.</li>
    <li> I was happy with all the above purchases.  Rita Harmeyer</li>
    <li> Excellent Philips quality at a good price.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, powerful</li>
    <li> The Phillips Sonicare Healthywhite is designed to make your teeth whiter in 2 weeks. My teeth get good care, having used first another model Sonicare and then and Braun electric toothbrush for years. So coming into this, I have pretty decent teeth care. The question is: does this thing really make your teeth whiter? So, I took a picture of my teeth before and after a two-week period of brushing with the Healthywhite Sonicare. I then took each image, placed them in a graphic-editing program (Adobe Fireworks) and compared the color values. The hexadecimal values use a range from #FFFFFF (pure white) to #000000 (pure black.) The higher the values, the lighter the images. Here are the results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time 1: #A17962 (10582370) [hex/decimal]&lt;br /&gt;Time 2: #F8F8F8  (16316664) [hex/decimal]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between the values is about 54%.  That is, I found a 54% brighter image (higher hex value) after brushing with the Sonicare brush for two weeks. I cannot guarantee that the lighting was exactly right or anything else was the same other than I used the same iPhone camera to get the digital images used with my graphic editing tool. However, even allowing for the differences in lighting, I&#x27;m pretty sure that it did get my teeth whiter just from looking at them. (It&#x27;s not as easy as you think to judge the whiteness of your teeth after two a two-week comparison.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protocol for brushing your teeth is a bit more complex. Each quadrant in your mouth is given a value of 1 to 4. (Outside teeth are odd values; inside, even.) The process has six steps: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and then back to Q1 and Q2 for a second time when using the special white teeth mode. When I first read the instructions, it seemed fairly complex for just brushing my teeth, but the brush signals when it&#x27;s time to change quadrants and it wasn&#x27;t too difficult to get used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two issues I found with the brush I believe could use improvement. First, the brush has three modes, and to change from one mode to the next, you click a power button--one, two or three clicks. The whitener mode is three clicks. The first time I did this, I put on toothpaste on the brush, and since I had to look at a green light that indicates which of the three modes I was in, I held it out to where I could see it. After cycling through the first two modes, the toothpaste was off my brush and all over me and the bathroom mirror. (If you&#x27;re thinking, \\&quot;Why not wait until you&#x27;re in the right mode to put on the toothpaste?\\&quot;; you try it with the thing vibrating like a nervous Chihuahua.) If you first are able set the mode, and then turn it on, you could avoid this problem. What good are those green mode-indicator lights going to do if the brush is in your mouth? I found that by putting the brush in my mouth before starting it and then pressing the mode button three times, I avoided this problem. Second, the stand is very small and easy to knock over (as I did as soon as I set it up.) The small stand is great for travel, but pretty unstable otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this brush and will continue to use it, blinding the world with white, bright teeth.hange from one mode to the next, you click a power button--one, two or three clicks.

    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a Philips Sonicare toothbrush in YEARS; mine was an early model that took what are now being sold as e-Series replacement heads. When it died, I migrated to the Braun model that my dentist sold at his cost and which I never liked quite as much. When it died, I went back to manual brushing but have kept an eye on both models in the ensuing years. Now I&#x27;m back to Sonicare, an updated model, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the Philips Sonicare HX6731/O2 HealthyWhite Rechargeable (*whew*) is a newer model; however, it&#x27;s kind of difficult to determine with this line. Regardless, this is by no means their top-of-the-line model (I think that distinction is held by the DiamondClean). However, it&#x27;s the more deluxe of their two-model HealthyWhite line which promises its users whiter teeth (two shades!) in two weeks if used in \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode; this adds another, gentler 15 seconds to the teeth in each front quadrant. I don&#x27;t think this worked for me but then, my teeth are pretty much impervious to any but clinical whitening efforts and even those don&#x27;t last (thanks, tetracyclene) so I&#x27;m not the ideal person to review this function. However, my teeth haven&#x27;t felt this clean after brushing in years, and for that I&#x27;m thankful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular HealthyWhite model has three cycles--the aforementioned \\&quot;Clean and White,\\&quot; \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; (sans \\&quot;and White\\&quot;), and \\&quot;Sensitive\\&quot; (which I haven&#x27;t used). It&#x27;s a good idea to start with \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; because it gradually and unobtrusively eases one into the the full-strength function over the course of the first 14 brushings. Cleaning is amazing. Rather than rotating, Sonicare brushes tend to blast whatever shouldn&#x27;t be there off your teeth and gums. New users might find the experience a little weird (I didn&#x27;t) but I recommend sticking with it because the rewards are potentially great. The cycles are a good way of segueing into this model&#x27;s few cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One is required to choose the cycle AFTER turning on the brush by means of continuing to push the \\&quot;On\\&quot; button. This, frankly, is something of a pain because one then has to wonder if the intended cycle is actually engaged (unless you want to try to study yourself in the mirror). It&#x27;s also necessary for the brush to be in use in order to determine how much charge it&#x27;s holding. And a \\&quot;pause\\&quot; feature would also be nice for those times when ones dentition-related ablutions are interrupted for some reason or other. In addition, this particular model comes with only one brush--the standard size. At this price point, including a brush with a smaller head would give new owners an idea of which brush best fits their needs, especially if the default standard brush is larger than is optimal. (My frustrated dentist trying to work in my rather small mouth: \\&quot;Remember when your mother used to tell you that you have a big mouth? She was lying.\\&quot;) And the replacement brushes are by no means cheap, especially if you want to upgrade to the DiamondClean line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged my Philips Sonicare HX6731/O2 HealthyWhite Rechargeable for a full 24 hours prior to first using it and don&#x27;t leave it in its charger between uses, even though the instructions state that I can. I find that the charge holds a good two weeks, which is good for short trips, and intend to allow it to fully discharge before charging it for another 24 hours. A nice travel case is included, as well as a protective cap for the brush head. A stand to hold the brush head would have been nice; I stand mine upright in the medicine chest after use in order to let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read reviews of other Sonicare models that state there have been quality control problems that result breakage. I guess time will tell and I&#x27;ll update this review if I experience problems. Registering the HealthyWhite Rechargeable online extends the 2-year warranty by another six months; the downside is that one is required to open an online Philips account in order to do this (for my money, a PITA). Bear in mind that a solid warranty is a good thing only if it guarantees your product on the offhand chance that there&#x27;s a problem; repeated warranty claims, even if honored, come down to a product one can&#x27;t depend upon and that&#x27;s not in your possession, doing its intended job. I&#x27;ll keep my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m crazy about the HealthyWhite Rechargeable and so far am delighted with it. Five stars for the time being.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great. New heads are a bit expensive compared to a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real complaint is that the battery is soldered to the printed circuit board inside the toothbrush. When the battery dies, and all batteries die sooner or later. The brush is toast. You can dismantle the toothbrush and there is a company that will sell you a new battery. I had a job where I repaired printed circuit boards, so I know what I am doing. I changed the battery, it works, and it was not easy for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you know what you are doing, the battery dies you buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I have had friends and relatives rave about Sonicare for years, I just thought it was to much money.  Well I got them with a coupon from Amazon and I am now one of those people who rave.  My teeth and gums never looked and feel better.  I like the whitening gear, works very well.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my second sonic care tooth brush.  My fourth electric toothrush across a span of many, many years.  If you don&#x27;t use an electronic toothbrush - you should absolutely move to one! You will notice the difference in whiteness in your teeth and your multiple daily experience will become more enjoyable.  Whether you have used one or not - this is a great choice, based upon my experience.  Here&#x27;s why vs. the options I like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I tried out a couple of Oral B ones before making the switch to Sonic care. I like Soniccare better for the features, value,longevity  and ease of finding the correct replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;2. This one ups the current features I have on an existing one by adding two things I really like - great ease of travelability (travel charger and case), multiple setting for more/less vigorous brushing (especially good if you have any sensitive areas).&lt;br /&gt;3. Plus, it has the features of the other that I love - the 30 second notification to move to another part of your teeth and the two-minute feature to let you know you&#x27;ve done the necessary two-minutes for a complete brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Noticable whitening and great features combined with the Soniccare quality everyone should have.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never had an electric toothbrush of any kind.  Noticeably there is less time spent now with the rubber pic after brushing. Still floss. Feels good on my gums while brushing.  I don&#x27;t use the most aggressive setting. I would recommend. Not a 5 star yet as I&#x27;ve only been using it for 1 week and am waiting to see how well it whitens my teeth. :)</li>
    <li> first electric toothbrush i have ever used. getting used to it but already teeth feel cleaner and i know that i do a better job time management (brushing) than with manual. good checkups too.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace one I have had for 6 years, after the battery died. Love how my mouth feels.</li>
    <li> I never thought I would say this about a toothbrush, but I&#x27;m totally in love! I&#x27;ve never had my teeth feel cleaner, except after a dentist visit. It takes a bit to get used to, but it has been so worth it!!</li>
    <li> This is a pricy product, so we expected it to last.  It lasted about 9 months when used by 1 person.  Then it would randomly turn itself on - which is pretty unnerving at 2AM.  Once that started, it never stopped.  Guess I should have paid more attention to the reviews before I bought it.  Anyway, it did a good job cleaning and we got it on the recommendation of our dentist.  It just didn&#x27;t last long enough to be worth the cost and the hassle of repair/replacement wasn&#x27;t worth it.  After all, it is a toothbrush even if it&#x27;s a pricy one.&lt;br /&gt;We replaced this with a significantly cheaper model by a competitor and my hubs loves it so much more than he liked this one.  I can&#x27;t recommend this one unless you are OK w/replacing it regularly - which seems a waste of money to me.  The reason I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars is that it does clean well.  That&#x27;s the only reason, though.</li>
    <li> never leave home without it!</li>
    <li> The Sonicare does a great job of cleaning your teeth but Philips seem unable to produce a product that is reliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past five years I have had three and all failed with battery/charging problems. Yesterday the fourth gave up the ghost with, you guessed it, another dud battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my electric toothbrush but I&#x27;m afraid the next one will definitely not be a Philips Sonicare.</li>
    <li> Every time I brush my teeth with this, it feels as if I just walked out of the dentist&#x27;s office!</li>
    <li> I already owned the Philips Sonicare Essence but in almost every way the HX6731/02 is superior. It is about 50% more expensive but the difference in price can be offset as I&#x27;ll mention later.  The HX6731 is thinner, lighter and the vibrating feels less intense. The vibrating was one of the things about the Essence I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of. It comes with a nice travel case and its more portable size makes travelling with it a more realistic option. Another issue I had with the Essence was that it advertised 2 weeks of brushing on a single charge but for whatever reason if I didn&#x27;t keep the brush on the charger between every brushing I&#x27;d have no charge when I tried to use it. This was from day one so it wasn&#x27;t like I had an old battery that was no longer taking a good charge. The HX6731 actually seems to be able to hold a charge. One weird thing about the HX6731 is that the brushing pauses for a fraction of a second 3 times during brushing. At first I thought this was some kind of design bug but now I wonder if it&#x27;s done to give the user an indication of how much longer it would brush. Maybe it&#x27;s there to indicate 25%, 50% and 75% completion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest difference is in the replacement brushes. The replacement brushes for the Essence are a significant amount of the unit including metal and plastic. On Amazon a two pack will run you $25. The replacement brushes for the HX6731 are just about the bare minimum of material which seems to me to make a lot more sense. A three pack is around $20 so a single replacement brush for the HX6731 is around $5.50 cheaper which over time makes the more expensive HX6731 seem like the economical choice.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral-B brushes for a few years and have been perfectly fine with them. But I always wondered how the Sonicare ones fared. I found the feel to be pretty different than the Oral Bs. Initially, it took a few days to get used to because my teeth were sensitive to the Sonicare - I never had this issue with the Oral-Bs. My teeth got used to the new brush and the mild pain went away after a few days, and I really started to like the Sonicare. I think it does a better job of cleaning my teeth than the Oral-Bs (and I have one of the top Oral-B models). Not only do my teeth feel noticeably cleaner after each use compared to the Oral-Bs, they were actually whiter after a few weeks. The Sonicare got rid of coffee stains better than the Oral-Bs. I&#x27;m pretty impressed with Sonicare and am now a convert.</li>
    <li> I have owned 2 of these and the weakness is the fitting at the top that the brush fits on.  Both handles have broken at that connection which lets water into the handset and can cause problems with it working correctly.  The first just had a silicone like seal that broke after less than 6 months.  The second had a hard plastic fitting but this one cracked after about one year.  They need to make these more durable considering the price.</li>
    <li> I previously used regular toothbrushes because I thought that as long as I brushed for 2 minutes or longer my teeth would be fine.  I did a little research before buying this toothbrush and can say I was NOT disappointed.  I could tell how much better this toothbrush worked after the first brushing.  My teeth have never felt cleaner than after brushing with this toothbrush.  There are 3 different settings, but have only tried the normal one so far.  I would highly recommend this toothbrush if you are on the fence about going to electronic route.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Sonicare brusher since late &#x27;90s.  Ever since this brush hit the market, it became an instant hit in my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthywhite, in my view, is their best design yet.  I have been using their old &#x27;screw on&#x27; head style toothbrush for a very long time.  Everyone remembers the heavy handle, and white jellies who live under the screw-on brush.  Healthywhite does not have any of these drawbacks.  It&#x27;s slim, lightweight and the brush is just firmly stuck on base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, you cannot go wrong.  If you want a better clean, go with DiamondClean brushheads.  Just remember, there are some complaints about them not staying on.  Do not remove your DiamondClean brush after you put in on Healthywhite.</li>
    <li> This item stopped working one year after I purchased it.  Should have lasted much longer for the price.</li>
    <li> My viewpoint is that of a first-time electric toothbrush user. Making a switch from a standard toothbrush to an electric is not really something we think about regularly. Perhaps it is psychological -- we are so accustomed to standard toothbrushes that electrics just seem odd and out of place even if you have regular dentist appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the key to making a permanent switch is making it as easy and understandable as possible, highlighting the advantages. Philips seems to me to have successfully done this with this Sonicare HX6731 product. For one thing, the manual is incredibly easy to understand. From the beginning, it explains that the basic function is to keep you on track evenly brushing your teeth for exactly two minutes, which is what dentists recommend. One button push and you&#x27;re started. Every 30 seconds, the unit slightly beeps at you to let you know to move on the next section of your teeth (back and front of upper teeth, back and front of lower teeth). If you have sensitive teeth, there is a special setting for you too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build of the device is quite attractive. It cleans very easily with water. The top bristles section is EASILY removable so that you can replace it quickly, or I suppose even share the motorized part of the unit with someone else (i.e. that someone else has an additional top bristles section just for them). It&#x27;s recommended that you replace the bristle part every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is actually the charging. I don&#x27;t know about you, but when I clean my electric razor with water, I get a little nervous about plugging it into the recharger. This electric toothbrush does NOT have a similar issue. Basically, from what I can tell it uses an inductive charging method which requires no connected wires (it&#x27;s complicated, don&#x27;t ask me to explain). At any rate, there&#x27;s no way you can get shocked while recharging. Nifty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last little tip... I recommend that you put it in your mouth *before* turning it on to brush. That way, as it begins to vibrate it doesn&#x27;t shower water droplets everywhere and thus annoy you.* turning it on to brush. That way, as it begins to vibrate it doesn&#x27;t shower water droplets everywhere and thus annoy you.</li>
    <li> MY SON SAID IT HELPED CLEAN UP THE PLAQUE THAT ACCUMULATED WHILE HIS BRACES WERE ON  IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE AND IS A FEEL THE DIFFERENCE PRODUCT..</li>
    <li> Only three months, and it broke</li>
    <li> Used this electric brush for over a year and either I was using totally wrong or....I lost one of my permanent teeth and new dentist it &#x27;could&#x27; have been because of the electric brush.  N aturally it now sits in a drawer.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush gets my mouth a LOT cleaner than my regular toothbrush, without irritating my teeth or my gums. Honestly, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Context: I do one thorough cleaning at bedtime with flossing.  I do quick cleaning after meals and after getting up in the morning.  I&#x27;ve brought it on two trips - a 2 week trip and a 1 week trip without bringing the charger.  I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months now.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first sonicare.  I got it because my dentist stated that I&#x27;m brushing too hard and wearing down my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient - Should&#x27;ve gotten this thing years ago. Just slap a dab of toothpaste, and I use the traditional mode of 2 minutes.  (1 minute for behind the row of teeth and 1 minute for front of row of teeth and repeat for the other row. I then add in 1 minute to brush the molar surface)&lt;br /&gt;Cleans easy and place back into charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to remove brush and clean buildup at attachment site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to pack in its plastic case and throw into my toilet bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy on my gums&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Easy for superficial cleans where I sweep over the front/back of each row of teeth and molars and tongue in the morning to wipe off the &amp;#34; ager sleep morning goo&amp;#34; and after meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Didn&#x27;t have to worry about it holding a charge for 2 weeks of vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Great investment in terms of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Haven&#x27;t found any yet.  I know other reviews didn&#x27;t like certain features, but this is my first one, and I&#x27;m fine with the modes it offers.  I only use the traditional mode.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Had to replace my old one with a new model but it has the same charger so I could still use my old charging unit which has room for two head which are sanitized when you are done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used an electric toothbrush prior to this one. I&#x27;ve enjoyed it and the extra benefits of a cleaner-feeling mouth since I got it. My only complaint is that there is no &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; button so you have to brush the entire 2 minutes (or more if you do the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mode&amp;#34;) without being able to spit. I&#x27;m getting used to it but still end up dripping from time to time. Also don&#x27;t like that the only way to change modes is to press the button again. I&#x27;ve often thought I went to the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mode but found that I was on &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and there&#x27;s no way to just do part of a mode. It&#x27;s all or nothing. Either way, this brush is still better than a regular one so I give it four stars.</li>
    <li> After having my dentist hound me for years to switch to a Sonicare toothbrush, I finally did. I wish I would&#x27;ve done it a long time ago. It leaves your mouth feeling cleaner than ever. The built in timer is a nice feature as well. The only disappointment you&#x27;ll have with this is realizing how much you underbrushed before.</li>
    <li> I upgraded to this toothbrush after I got tired of my previous Sonicare Elite series, which I used daily for almost 5 years straight. The Elite series did an excellent job brushing my teeth, but by the end of it&#x27;s life, the battery no longer held a reasonable charge. On a full charge, it would brush for maybe 4 to 6 minutes total (2 to 3 brushings) before losing all power. Because the charging base was so large, this made it all but useless for travel. In addition, with the older Sonicare Elite-style brush heads, anyone who used to own one will tell you that they get GROSS quickly. The design seemed like it wasn&#x27;t well thought out - the brush would take in water into the cavity formed where the brush head screwed into it, and in a matter of days, you would literally have mold and filth growing in and around the gap between the two. It was very difficult to clean that gap out, and in the end, I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to buy another Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I began my first search for a new tooth brush in years, and I figured I&#x27;d end up with a competitor like Oral-B. However, I immediately noticed that Sonicare must have realized the flaw in their old design, and I noticed the new snap-on style brush head of the Healthywhite model. I sat down and compared reviews, and decided I&#x27;d give Sonicare another chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the brush for about a month now and I am VERY glad I went with this Healthywhite model. It keeps the great cleaning ability of my older Sonicare, while widely improving upon all of the previous flawed areas. First of all, the new brush heads just push down onto a metal rod and are very easily removable. The instructions recommend pulling the head off once a week and running the base of the head under water to rinse out any &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34;. Takes 5 seconds total and works perfectly, no more disgusting mold build-up. Secondly, the new charger it sits on is TINY, it would be perfect for extended travel if you think you&#x27;ll need a recharge away from home. But you probably won&#x27;t, as the battery on this thing is amazing. In the past 30 days, I&#x27;ve brushed roughly 60 times, and only had to charge the brush twice total! You could go on a two week trip with this brush and never need a single recharge. And lastly, the handle design on this Healthywhite is VERY comfortable to hold and maneuver while brushing. I never really had much of a complaint about the old design either, but this has certain been a pleasant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, Philips has simplified the design to make it easier to clean and maintain, improved the battery life immensely, and improved the charger design. Everything works well and this brush cleans my teeth as well as if not better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used before. I&#x27;ll update this in the future if I have any problems with it, but I really don&#x27;t know what else I&#x27;d ask for in a rechargeable toothbrush. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> works well with my teeth.</li>
    <li> It is quite convenient.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Took a little time to get used to the speed of the brush, but my teeth were never cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve also tried a similarly priced competitor&#x27;s electric toothbrush as well as those much cheaper electric spin brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m old and have owned quite a few electric toothbrushes over the decades. There have been many technological leaps forward, but my fav was going cordless. I look back now and think it was kind of crazy to have a 120 volt appliance in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric toothbrushes are available in a huge range of prices. The cheapest are disposable. The most expensive are feature packed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Philips Sonicare Healthywhite rechargeable sonic toothbrush is in the higher end of the price range, but is by no means the most expensive. You can easily spend twice as much. At this price point, reviews show that the top brands are pretty much the same in the area of cleaning performance. With good cleaning performance a given, individual brand and model nuances and features make the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, the Sonicare&#x27;s brush attachment is longer than the [[ASIN:B008PEMR0O Oral-B Professional Healthy Clean + Prowhite Precision 4000 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]], which is priced about the same. When I was little and learning to brush my teeth, my mom instilled in me a need to also brush the top and bottom of my tongue as far back as possible. The Sonicare&#x27;s longer brush lets me easily do so, the Oral-B does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the Oral-B has a feature that alerts you if you are pressing down too hard while brushing which might be most important to you if your dentist has said it&#x27;s something you have to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist once told me that he could tell I had a tendency to brush more on one side of my mouth than the other. Therefore, the feature on the Sonicare that reminds me to move on while brushing is a plus factor in its favor for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushes come in different shapes. I like the Sonicare&#x27;s more traditional shaped brush; you might like the competitors round brush. Another thing I&#x27;d advise you to be conscience of is whether or not a manufacturer supports its older models by continuing to sell replacement brushes that fit. Your expensive brush will become useless if you can&#x27;t get a replacement brush head. All manufacturers that I&#x27;ve seen recommended replacing brushes at least every three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I grew up watching a Philips television and my first multi-disk CD player was a Philips. The fact that I already know and trust the Philips brand is another reason I believe you will be happy with any of their electric toothbrushes.ed brush; you might like the competitors round brush.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this electric toothbrush for over 3 weeks now and I have seen a difference on my teeth.  It took some time to get used to vibration, it feels like a bee in your mouth more so than other electric brushes I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 modes: Clean, Sensitive, and Clean and White.  The product claims that using the \\&quot;Clean and White\\&quot; mode, your teeth will whiten 2 shades in 2 weeks.  I have tried this mode with regular toothpaste and I can tell a bit of a difference, maybe not 2 shades but a difference.  I am currently using an OTC whitening toothpaste and after a week, I can see more improvement, so it&#x27;s working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other features are not as &#x60;harsh&#x27; on the brushing than the Clean and White mode - which is the only one that last for 3 whole minutes instead of 2.  Prior to this product, I was using a Spinbrush and when I switched, I could tell the difference immediately.  A very good and deep cleaning everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush makes a mini pause every 30 seconds.  I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth so I jumped in the clean mode for a few days and then switch to Clean and White right away.  By all means, if you have sensitive teeth, then use this mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charged battery seems to last forever! I use it twice a day and have only charged it once in 3 weeks. The price is a bit high considering that the heads are expensive to replace but other than that, a very good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Terrific. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great product and a good value. The Sonicare toothbrush is easy to use, clean your teeth, and reduces plaque,  It&#x27;s also fun to use.</li>
    <li> This was a recent upgrade for me and while I like the toothbrush and how my teeth feel after using, I am not a fan of having to hold the power button down for 2 seconds for the brush to turn off.  You can also click through the different modes to turn off but that&#x27;s just as annoying too.</li>
    <li> I have used the same Sonicare Flexcare toothbrush for almost a decade now and this replacement lives up to that name.  The clean feeling from this line of toothbrushes is unlike anything else.  Combine it with some Xyloburst gum (fruit flavor tastes just like Juicy Fruit gum) and you&#x27;ve got an unbeatable cleaning combination!  I brush only in the mornings, not at night, and my dentist always tells me how well I take care of my teeth!  Thanks Philips!</li>
    <li> Before this, I was using an Oral B electric toothbrush with the smart guide, and I thought it was doing a pretty good job.  However, after using this, I have to say that the Phillips does a much better job at scrubbing teeth clean. My teeth look and feel much cleaner with this brush than with the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, is because the brush heads on this one are much more expensive to replace than the Oral-B - I mean really, why should these tiny brush heads cost almost $15 each?  The toothbrush itself costs enough, without having to constantly buy over-pried brush heads for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it didn&#x27;t come with the base shown where you can fit two brush heads on it for storage - mine came with only one brush head (again, at this price you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d include two brush heads at a minimum) and a single tiny base for charging. I had to order separately the charging stand cover that allows you to store two brush heads with the handle.  It didn&#x27;t cost much to order that, but I thought it was really cheap of them to not include it with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wish their was some kind of an external visual cue (an indicator light on the base or something) to let you know which mode your on, sometimes I can&#x27;t tell for sure if I have pressed the button 3 times to be on whitening mode and when you are brushing you can&#x27;t see the light to tell you which mode it&#x27;s on. That was one thing I liked better about the oral-b with smart guide - if you weren&#x27;t sure if it registered all your presses, you could look at the smart guide and it would show you what mode it was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those complaints aside, this toothbrush does do a much better job than any other toothbrush i have tried, which is why I still gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for several years now. It does and excellent job cleaning your teeth, so much so that my dentist noticed the difference. This also meant she had to use her scraping tools a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to Sonicare toothbrushes, they have the unique feature of oscillating at 31,000 rpm. They also promotes an even, consistent cleaning with a quadpacer timer that goes off every 30 seconds so you know when to move from one quadrant of teeth to the next for a total of two minutes. This model has three settings for normal, sensitive, and whitening operations. For most people, the normal setting will probably do the trick. Sensitive scales down the rpm, while whitening adds another 30 second timer to the quadpacer where you can focus an extra scrub on your front teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare toothbrush heads are removable, so you and a spouse can use the same toothbrush with different heads. Like traditional toothbrushes, Sonicare recommends replacing the heads every three months or so, a while some reviewers point out the high cost of replacement heads, it&#x27;s hard to draw a direct comparison since they don&#x27;t yield the same results. And while a fully charged Sonicare toothbrush can easily last you a week, it also comes with a travel charger for longer trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the Philips Sonicare is more than just a traditional toothbrush replacement. It cleans your teeth more thoroughly than a traditional toothbrush ever could. They&#x27;re fast, easy to use, and easy to store, and a great investment towards a lifetime of healthy smiles.</li>
    <li> 2nd Sonicare that I&#x27;ve had.  Will only use an electric one - and it&#x27;s the Sonicare!  5 stars all the way!!!</li>
    <li> Best tooth brush ever.. Have had several electric toothbrushes.. This one cleans the best by far.. Love it and recommend it highly</li>
    <li> I got the best report ever from my dental hygenist after using this for only a few weeks.  I like that the power is internationally compatible for travel unlike the old Braun brush I used to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I always end up with a gooey mess after brushing with saliva and toothpaste running down and dripping off the handle...</li>
    <li> I travel oversea at least once a year and I have been using the other brand Oral-B for several years.  Every time I&#x27;m oversea, I have to carry a power converter just for toothbrush.  After much research, only Philips makes toothbrush that support dual voltage so I ordered this and it turn out that the toothbrush cleaning much better than Oral-B product.</li>
    <li> Old one broke. Glad to have found good price here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The best toothbrush in the world. (Hubby is a dentist, or else I wouldn&#x27;t know lollll)&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!! ;)</li>
    <li> I had a bunch of reward points burning a hole in my pocket, decided to splurge on my pearly whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No regrets.  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months now and I love it.  I feel like I just got back from the dentist every day (without the scolding for not flossing enough). Speaking of flossing, for some reason I have caught myself flossing more regularly after buying this.  Must be some mind control that Philips developed, it&#x27;s impressive really.  Really excited to brag to my dentist about my oral hygiene improvements.  Only took me 25 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is pretty stinkin&#x27; good, 1-2 weeks at a time between charges.  I travel a lot for work, so that can come in handy, especially for people who only travel for a few days at a time.  No need to bring the charger unless you&#x27;re gone for an extended period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the whitening function, adds a bit of time to focus on the front teeth to blast away those coffee and soda stains.  My teeth were noticeably whiter after only a week of regular use.  The whitening function also seems to be a bit more aggressive, and I like the way it kind of shakes my brain while I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself looking forward to brushing, where I used to be guilty of getting lazy some nights and skipping it.  Judge away, internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;ve been using significantly less toothpaste with this brush, so surely I&#x27;ll have it paid off in no time!</li>
    <li> Same product as sold in Walgreen&#x27;s, but a much better price. My only problem was the delay in delivery, but it&#x27;s a great product for the reduced price</li>
    <li> At first, I bleed with the toothbrush but later it is right.</li>
    <li> Within 2 weeks, I went to the dentist.  He asked, if I had acleaning recently.&lt;br /&gt;He said my teeth looked like they had been cleaned by a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I have used an Oral B \\&quot;electric\\&quot; toothbrush for years.  It was more effective than manual brushing.  BUT:  this Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 Healthywhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is amazing.  I could tell an immediate and impressive difference after the very first use.  After three days, using it 2 x daily, my teeth were whiter and brighter with a literal polished look.  It has now been one week and I can no longer feel any tarter on my teeth and they have brightened a little more.  Since it is time for my 6 month cleaning at the dentist, I am interested to get that feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I was advised by another user to always dry the brush after use before returning it to the holder.  It is especially important to clean the small recessed hole in the bottom where it rests on the charging base otherwise the residual bacteria will cause a terrible smell over time.  I use a cutip. I highly recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush  ever!!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I had the Hx5610? model prior so this model is an improvement in several areas:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quad timer for 2 minute brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;- 3 modes for different levels and duration of brushing.&lt;br /&gt;- Improved head, specifically the head is now a single molded piece. They got rid of the rubber base/cap that connects to the handle. This hated piece used to collect gunk and cracks easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Perhaps price should be coming down as these become more common.&lt;br /&gt;- Sonicare has way too many models out there. Buying replacement heads gets confusing.</li>
    <li> Sonicare has so many models out it&#x27;s hard just to replace what one has!  And they haven&#x27;t substantially improved things!&lt;br /&gt;One button to push three times for the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; cycle . . . after it&#x27;s in your mouth . . . grrrr.</li>
    <li> Lots of pros with this 5-star brush:&lt;br /&gt;-3 different speeds&lt;br /&gt;-Timer reminds you to switch quadrants every 30 seconds&lt;br /&gt;-Holds charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;-Teeth feel cleaner, longer throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;-Not sure yet if it whitend teeth&lt;br /&gt;-Brush heads are 3 per pack and affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great electric toothbrush-- 5 stars for such good performance and value.</li>
    <li> The Sonicare Healthywhite is arguably one of the best toothbrushes you can buy, if you can afford the price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For over a decade I&#x27;ve used a couple Oral-B circular brush head electric toothbrushes and I recently was using the [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Electric Toothbrush 1 Count]], which I really liked.  The Oral-B Pulsonic is a great toothbrush and roughly half the price of this Sonicare Healthywhite.  However, after trying the Healthywhite for a month, I&#x27;ve decided to stick with it for one reason...it&#x27;s shear sonic cleaning power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first use the Sonicare Healthywhite, it incrementally ramps up the sonic brushing power during the first 14 days.  At least that&#x27;s what it says. I feel that it ramped up the brushing power during the first 4-5 days, and then it was something indistinguishable from max power.  And max power is...very powerful.  More powerful than the Oral-B Pulsonic, which I thought did a great job keeping my somewhat problematic gums healthy.  This Sonicare blasts away any sticky films or grime on your teeth.  If you haven&#x27;t used an ultrasonic toothbrush before, I might even recommend using the Healthywhite on the gentle setting for awhile, until your gums can take it heavy sonic blasts of full power.  Once you get used to the full power sonic cleaning, though, your teeth and gums feel refreshed after each brushing.  In my non-dentist opinion, I think the high-end circular Oral-B electric brushes still do a fantastic job keeping your teeth clean, but ultrasonic brushes do a better job maintaining healthy gums.  The box claims that it will whiten your teeth, but I&#x27;m not so sure about that claim.  I believe it would be more accurate if they stated, \\&quot;The Healthywhite will maintain your current teeth whiteness level.\\&quot;  I think it blasts away fresh coffee stains from that morning, but remove previous years worth of coffee yellowing?  Well, that didn&#x27;t happen for me in a month of usage.  You&#x27;re going to need hydrogen peroxide for that, regardless of whatever any toothbrush box says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brush itself, it takes several hours to fully juice the unit, but it lasts for about 7 days on a single, full charge.  The brush head that came included in the box is a solid performer, but for about the same amount of money, I kind of prefer the diamond clean brush heads simply because they feel a bit more firm for my gums.  This Healthywhite model can accept either replaceable brush head, so it&#x27;s up to you what you prefer.  I do wish Philips would include one type of brush head each in the box, though, so consumers could try it out before being adventurous and buying a new 3 or 6 pack of replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t have much to complain about with this Philips Sonicare Healthywhite other than the price.  You can get the Oral-B Pulsonic for roughly half the price, but it might also be half the brushing power of this Healthywhite.gen peroxide for that, regardless of whatever any toothbrush box says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the brush itself, it takes several hours to fully juice the unit, but it lasts for about 7 days on a single, full charge.

You can get the Oral-B Pulsonic for roughly half the price, but it might also be half the brushing power of this Healthywhite.</li>
    <li> I really like the Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 and am very happy with it&#x27;s cleaning abilities -- out of the box, as is, my rating is 5 STARS-&gt; as advertised, excellent product, am extremely satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When shopping at my local warehouse I came across a six pack of Philips Diamond head replacement brushes so I decided to upgrade the brush on my Sonicare HX6731/02 to see if this would make any significant difference. Hands down the Diamond Brush wins on every performance level for me. My kids use the Diamond brush heads- they find them comfortable- first with the easy start easing them into using an electric brush. Great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a electric toothbrush before but a friend of mine recommended I try it. I did my research and this model is highly rated and comes with a solid brand name of Sonicare. I get three options to choose from &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Whiten&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34;....so far i&#x27;ve only used &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m about to step it up to &amp;#34;Clean and Whiten&amp;#34;. Since i&#x27;ve never used one before I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect...let me tell you... it&#x27;s different at first...it took a few brushes for my gums to get used to the brush, but now i&#x27;m good to go. My teeth have never felt this clean from brushing myself... and I would brush my teeth maybe once a day if that... now i&#x27;m brushing twice a day and look forward to it. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days but I swear my teeth already look whiter.... It comes with a prohealth toothbrush head but I read reviews and people said the Diamond brush heads are a lot better, so I just ordered those too and skipped right to them, I ordered the compact diamond brush heads and they are awesome, i don&#x27;t really have anything to compare them too yet but I will try the proheath brush head that came with it to see how that works but from what i read, the diamond heads are where its at! The only thing I don&#x27;t really like is that it has no &amp;#34;pause&amp;#34; between the quadpacer cycles and spit gathers up quite a bit while using this so I just take two seconds and spit half way through.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare Healthywhite toothbrush.  I bought this one because after 5 years my other one stopped taking a charge, which is normal for a rechargeable toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my teeth feel afterwards, escpecially if you use the two minute setting on it.&lt;br /&gt;I have always gotten good dental checkups, and I believe my Sonicare helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars if they could only get the batteries to last longer, but 5 years is not bad.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. My mouth feels so much cleaner and I am noticing teeth getting significantly whiter.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for almost a month now and am really impressed. Right away, my teeth felt cleaner, and I did notice a difference in brightness after about two weeks&#x27; use using just regular toothpaste and no other whitening products. Since I&#x27;m a big coffee and tea drinker, I had been starting to notice some slight staining near some white fillings I have on a couple of teeth. The whitening factor was its biggest selling point to me, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that it sits on a small base, is lighter than my last electric toothbrush, and came with a travel case.</li>
    <li> Loved going back to a sonicare.  It&#x27;s so much easier to brush your teeth and they feel cleaner.  I had an old sonicare so this one is better.</li>
    <li> I had a first series toothbrush for years (bought around 2004), never any problems. I think Phillips has dropped the ball in the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;Crappy quality - expect to replace the one you buy these days under warranty, and buy a new one in 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;Bought my new series (Clean and White) in 2012 with 2 handles - both handles failed within a year - replaced under warranty. I am out of warranty now and one of the 2 replacements died. Phillips recommends going to a local repair shop to see if they can fix it (they don&#x27;t really want anything to do with me any more).&lt;br /&gt;Will I be buying another $60+ toothbrush from Phillips? I think not.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush does a great job of cleaning teeth.  It is kind of noisy, though.  I think it is a good brand.  My son and husband already had this brand.  My former brush died, so I thought I might as well get one, too.  That way, when I buy brush heads, I can buy a lot at a time, knowing we can all use some.</li>
    <li> I never write these things, but buy this toothbrush.  My teeth feel amazing.  Smooth as glass!  Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> My teeth have never been cleaner!</li>
    <li> We have been using this battery operated, Sonicare, tooth brush for about 16 months.  Both handles FAILED: WOULD NOT CHARGE OR OPERATE within weeks of each other.  I replace the first one immediately.  Now, I&#x27;m considering changing to a different brand.  From the reviews of others consumers,  their battery handle stop operating in a much shorter time.  &amp;#34;Planned Obsolescence&amp;#34; has been detected  built-in to the produces of some corporations. The idea, of course, is to keep selling consumers their produces, but much more frequently.  I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if other manufacturers have now picked up and are using this same strategy.  Phillips historically has maintained a high standard in the area of reliability and overall fine workmanship of their products.  In the case of their dental products, Sonicare, their reputation is plummeting.</li>
    <li> Switched to Philips Sonicare Healthy White from Oral B several years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The Sonicare brush head motion seems much more effective at cleaning teeth than the Oral B pattern.  The first Sonicare, purchased 2-1/2 years ago, is still working perfectly, but I decided to replace it before a long overseas trip.  (The battery charger is dual-voltage, so no converter will be needed.)  The &amp;#34;gentle start&amp;#34; feature is great for first time users, and avoids gum pain by taking two weeks to build up to the full brush head motion.  You can reset the brush motion to &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; if needed following dental work or surgery.  I&#x27;m not sure how effective the &amp;#34;healthy white&amp;#34; feature is - it seems to just add brushing time, but overall, the toothbrush is reliable, effective and seems to a good value in the Sonicare product line.  This particular package included a hard case, which is lightweight and will hold two brush heads, in addition to a small plastic travel cap.</li>
    <li> I have never had an electric toothbrush before and I love it! My teeth always have the feeling that I usually only feel after I have returned from a cleaning at the dentist. I highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using [[ASIN:B0019ZGU1S Philips Sonicare HX6732/02 HealthyWhite R732 Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] for about a year now. This product is very similar. If your not used to using any sort of rechargeable toothbrush this one can take some getting used to. At least it did for me. The vibration of the brush can be rather intense. There&#x27;s a two minute timer that shuts the toothbrush off when the time is up. I really like this feature. It also comes with travel case so you can take it along with you when traveling. Fortunately, a full charge will last a long time. I went 28 days before having to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to offer a caution, however. After you put your toothpaste on the brush, do NOT turn on the toothbrush before you insert it into your mouth. Otherwise, you have going to lose most of your toothpaste in the sink or get it all over yourself. I&#x27;ve learned this from experience. I, personally, wouldn&#x27;t use any other toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Replacing a sonicare that stopped working after only a few years. Great toothbrush + really hoping it lasts longer than the previous one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 Healthywhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for a month now, and I have to say it does seem to make my mouth feel cleaner. It&#x27;s the most intense electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s simple to operate, and the battery seems to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple reasons I give it 4 stars instead of 5. Number 1: the cost for replacement heads is in my opinion way too much. Number 2: the Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 Healthywhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush promises whiter teeth, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. To be fair, I didn&#x27;t expect any miracles and my teeth do feel cleaner. But if you&#x27;re looking for whiter teeth, you will probably be disappointed. And number 3: I prefer a large head toothbrush. The head on the Sonicare HX6731/02 is tiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the Philips Sonicare HX6731/02 Healthywhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is one of the best toothbrushes you can own. As long as you&#x27;re aware of the long term cost to operate it, and don&#x27;t expect too much in the terms of whitening, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> A little disappointing for 100 bucks.</li>
    <li> My first electric toothbrush so I have nothing to compare it to, but my dentist recommended it and I love it.​</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare line for about 20 years now and this is the BEST toothbrush to date. Smooth, thorough cleaning and nice streamlined handle.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th Sonicare in 20 years. I replace the brush heads - purchased at Costco -every three months. It does the job and is gentle to both enamel and gums.</li>
    <li> I see noticeable whiteness in my teeth in just 3 weeks. My teeth feel like I just came from the dentist every time I brush! Thanks for the fast, easy transaction.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my wife who feels good and commends quality of Philips Sonicare. I think this model is suit for teeth healthy.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job and my dental checkups are perfect.  I thought the charger base looked a little flimsy so, I am using the one from my old Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> High cost-effective toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical about the Sonicare, and trying to figure out which model to buy, but I picked a winner with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Braun rechargeable before, and the difference in cleaning between the two couldn&#x27;t be more profound.  If you have ever purchased a new toothbrush, and after the first brush you have the feeling that your teeth are smooth and cleaner than usual - well, this toothbrush gives you that feel x 100 every time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using my old one for 5 years before I got this one.  I had only been using it for a few weeks before a cleaning visit with my dentist.  She was very pleased with the the cleanliness of my teeth (which were never bad) but the length of time in the chair was reduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this was a great gift to give &amp; to receive :-).  The charge seems to last forever, which is great too.  Comes with a travel case as well.</li>
    <li> great tooth brush it gets the job done,pro forms as stated multi-fuctions is nice as well.Nice power not to over bearing...</li>
    <li> I had several Essences previous to this Healthy White and I am very happy with the upgraded model.  The brush is gentle but it seems to brush the teeth more thoroughly.  The brush head interface with the handle is smaller and doesn&#x27;t trap as much moisture so there&#x27;s less mess on the counter when brushing is complete.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure that this is a great product for keeping teeth clean and healthy, and my dentist highly recommends it. But, I just can&#x27;t stand the vibration.  I have never had a sonic toothbrush, but have used ordinary electric toothbrushes for years and don&#x27;t mind the vibration from those. Although I had the sonic in the &amp;quot;easy-start&amp;quot; mode, whenever it touched my lips or cheeks it was extremely uncomfortable. I&#x27;ll be returning it and go back to the regular electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> My last phillips toothbrush lasted about 10 years. This one I bought on 12/13 and its already dead. 1.5 years not worth the $90  Edited: I am updating this review because while the toothbrush didn&#x27;t last that long. I bought 3 other different ones and they are all far inferior to this 1.5 year toothbrush. It has good strength and does a great job at keeping my teeth on point.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush is great! Teeth feel clean, works well. I will never go back to a manual toothbrush again. I would recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> If you still don&#x27;t have a Sonicare, just get one! Everyone who has to deal with your mouth will thank you.</li>
    <li> finally broke down and switched from my Oral B and got this Sonicare.  what a world of difference.  i have no regrets in making the switch.  had the toothbrush for three weeks and can feel and see a major improvement.  get the diamond clean replacement heads for greater satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I love the rechargeable electric toothbrush.  My teeth feel so much cleaner without feeling like I&#x27;m stripping away the enamel.  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a long time.  I recommend this Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t keep a permanent brush setting like you could on the former model that had 5 different brush settings.  This one only has three settings and as soon as you turn the brush off, it resets to the first setting.  To turn it off outside of the auto shut off after 2 minutes you have to go through all of the settings. The sensitive setting does not feel sensitive.  Disappointed overall with this expensive toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Package was supposed to come with 3 attachments for the brush. The outside of the package said it contains refills and there were indents/spaces in the package where the refills should be. Only, to my dismay 2 of them were missing. Very disappointing experience to say the least.</li>
    <li> Too soon to make  assessment.  Works now.  I will let you know in ten years  I m concise.  So be it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new toothbrush and are even considering an electric toothbrush, buy this one. My mouth feels so clean and fresh after every brushing and I actually find myself enjoying brushing my teeth, Great product, easy to use and my mouth is whiter, cleaner and healthier.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  My teeth always feel dentist clean!  The stand is much smaller then the other sonicare toothbrushes so it doesn&#x27;t hog the counter space.</li>
    <li> My teeth are cleaner now.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush, so I may be a little biased, but it is everything I wanted &amp; more. I decided to get an electric toothbrush after my dentist recommended it for my receding gum lines. I can report that since I started using it 2 months ago, my gums have not been painful at all. There are many other great features I enjoy. I like the 30 second indicator, so you know when to switch quadrants. I like how the vibrations steadily increase over the first 14 uses, so you can become accustomed to the feeling. I have noticed my teeth have become whiter since I started using it &amp; I love how clean my teeth feel after each use. Another thing to add, this toothbrush is compatible with many of the toothbrush heads in the Phillips Sonicare line, as part of their snap-on system. For instance, I bought the the Diamond Clean brush heads as my replacements at the 3 month mark &amp; they fit perfectly. I would highly recommend this toothbrush!</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It&#x27;s fantastic, truly.&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-very high quality build&lt;br /&gt;-easy extended warranty registration&lt;br /&gt;-the battery lasts forever between charges&lt;br /&gt;-cleans my teeth very well&lt;br /&gt;-great for sensitive teeth&lt;br /&gt;-whitens teeth well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the toothbrush heads are a bit expensive, however I scoop them up when they&#x27;re on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-tip: Read the instructions on how to use the brush.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase that was very easy and a GREAT deal! Item is just what was promised. Thank you for a great experience!</li>
    <li> I had an Oral B Vitality toothbrush that was pretty good, but on my last few visits to the dentist, I was told that I needed a better brush due to the fact that I produce tartar faster than most people. It was a funny feeling at first, but you can almost feel it actually getting in every little spot in your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS HAS BEEN AN AWESOME IMPROVEMENT!</li>
    <li> I love the choice of using the different settings which i didnt have with my previous electric toothbrush. Works great.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve never had a high rpm electrc toothbrush before, I highly recommend it, for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one runs on a 2 minute brush cycle, with 30 second interval interruptions.. This alone is a vast improvement over a manual toothbrush, as it help ensure you properly bush your entire mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need to actually brush your teeth, as the high speed head does all the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small brush head makes it easier to reach those hard to reach areas. Handle is not too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t compare this one to others, since this is my first.. If you register on line there is a 2.5 year warranty, whatever that is worth.</li>
    <li> takes a little getting used to if this is the first time you have used an electric toothbrush. love how clean it makes your whole mouth feel!</li>
    <li> Basic model. Works well but all Sonicare brushes last 1 to 2 years only. You can recharge them at some point.</li>
    <li> Just an update, I ordered this model sept 2013 and it&#x27;s now April 2015 and the toothbrush is still running strong.  19 months! +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Phillips rejected my review from their web site, either because I said the replacement heads were pricey or that you need the extended warranty.  I owned 2 of this earlier model and they worked great.  The first a little over a year, the second 18 months, I&#x27;m not loosing the warranty infor and receipt this time.  While the tooth brush is a little pricey, a set of 3 replacement heads is in the mid twenties, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush due to receding gums.  I also had a spot in the far back of mouth on a molar that kept getting a build up of tartar.  My gums are fine now and back to being healthy and over the last few years there is barely any scraping of tartar in the hard to reach areas.  Oh I also kept wearing down gums in one area due to brushing too hard, gums are good there too.  It will take a little getting use to using, I&#x27;d bump the head on my teeth and it will scare you with the vibration, and don&#x27;t open your mouth of tooth paste will spray the mirror.  Anyway you only have one set of teeth, so on average less than $10 a month for a toothbrush, it&#x27;s worth it that&#x27;s why I  bought my third one.</li>
    <li> Fantastic, lightened my girlfriend&#x27;s teeth in three days! Replacement heads seem expensive, but if they last the proposed three months, then it&#x27;s a bargain for such a deep clean.</li>
    <li> As usual Philips Sonicare toothbrush hits the x right on the spot! This little toothbrush lets me know when to start brushing and when I am done for the day. It is a must in my househould so we can keep the dentist happy!</li>
    <li> awesomeness in a small package.  Cleans like nothing I&#x27;ve ever seen and we had the older/lower version.  Love the new heads, love the power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The different settings, well, if you don&#x27;t have sensitive gums (my kid uses it even) then you always put it on the highest power so kinda useless but who cares!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and I recommend sonicare toothbrushes all the time. My only complaint about this model is that you have to repeatedly push the button in order to turn it on and off. You must got through all three setting in order to turn it off. Besides that, it works great.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> All you have to do is put the toothbrush on your teeth/gums and turn it on.  It does all the scrubbing for you.  I have learned to place the bristles on my gums instead of directly on my teeth as brushing directly on the teeth make your gums recede.  This toothbrust scrubs in the direction you should be brushing instead of back and forth like everyone does.  Using a regular toothbrush and the back and forth motion of the brushing really screwed up my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> Did some research before purchasing this unit and am very pleased with this battery operated brush. It works very well and leaves your teeth feeling like you just left the dentist.  Does have considerable vibration but love it.</li>
    <li> bought 1 seen a whiter difference in a few days !!!!! get between teeth better also. Purchased another one a few days later for another family member...Well pleased.</li>
    <li> I purchased this at the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  Have only used it for a few days so far, but I&#x27;m blown away by how long my mouth feels &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; compared to the 15 minutes of freshness I get from a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the built-in timers, which I assumed would be gimmicky, but are actually very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My gums are already looking better, can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement after a few months of use.</li>
    <li> Our other toothbrush (same model) was on its last legs - we thought it was the off-brand heads... but after our older one (5 years old) started itself up spontaneously in the middle of the night - multiple times between 12-2am - I ended up going outside and throwing it in the car so we could continue sleeping! We live in a motorhome and travel so the noise kept us awake cos it&#x27;s a small space. Eventually the battery died. Fortunately a new one was already on the way via Amazon and the difference is night and day! We hadn&#x27;t noticed how ineffective the older one was (as we blamed it on the generic cheaper heads) but no, the poor old toothbrush was just past it&#x27;s use by date. Bought the same one to replace as we have been very happy with it. Just don&#x27;t leave it too long to replace as we did, if it starts to misbehave or clap out. Great for travel too, compact and not too heave and this particular one doesn&#x27;t build up a disgusting layer of gunk inside the head like another older model I used to have. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great product , I have been using it for the last 8 years.</li>
    <li> I upgraded from a perfectly functional sonicare e-series brush because I was just so tired of cleaning the thing out. If you&#x27;re unaware, the e-series brushes have a different head design that allows mold and bacteria to grow inside the unit. This brush has a differently design head, and no mess!  **** Edit ****  Unfortunately, the (non removable) battery in this device kicked the bucket after only a year or so. I&#x27;ve removed a star to reflect that.</li>
    <li> I love it  i hope it last longer than 2 years&lt;br /&gt;But over all I see a differents in my smile&lt;br /&gt;: )</li>
    <li> I have used an older model for about 15 years.  It died.  I bought another Sonicare because of the good service that I had from the original brush.  This brush cleans better than the old brush.  I am happy with the product and will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used several makes and models of electric toothbrushes over the years, and this one is a keeper if you can find it for a price around $80 to $90. I saw what appeared to be the same model toothbrush on different sites ranging in price from $77 to $190. The heads on the brush are designed to reach those hard to reach places, and they curve with the shape of the teeth and gums. I don&#x27;t feel as if my teeth have been hammered with this brush; as some brushes have made me feel. I will report later after a dental exam; as to the effectiveness of the cleaning ability. I do find; that the differences in the settings is not as pronounced; as it has been in other brushes. The quality for the price is good if you shop the price around.</li>
    <li> Loved this toothbrush before it quit working. I think I am over Philips brand brushes. I have owned 3 in the past 4 years and all have stopped working. For the price, I would expect them to last longer. They are too expensive to replace nearly every year.</li>
    <li> i wanted the diamond head toothbrush but i saw this model instead. A lot cheaper than 189! works great. cleans my teeth and gum. i have whiter teeth in 2 weeks. yay</li>
    <li> Exactly the right amount of power. I love my Sonicare electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> this is my first electric tooth brush in over 10 years.  I really like it and on my last cleaning appointment at the dentist took half the time.  I should have ordered a softer head when I bought it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Honestly. I use it everyday and it works really well. Helps my teeth stay happy and healthy which is important!</li>
    <li> The brush heads are supposed to last for 3 months. And the white stripe indicates when they need to be changes. The brush heads for me only last about a month.</li>
    <li> I replaced my former Sonicare given it became noisy from the vibrating head base becoming loose, probably from water getting inside and rusting the vibrating mechanism. But in comparing it to a much more expensive Sonicare I had with additional features (like massage), or even the basic model, I don&#x27;t feel or see any difference that promotes whiter teeth...just simply superior cleaning ability over a manual cheap toothbrush. While any Sonicare is superior to a manual brush and promotes gum health (along with proper flossing regularly), I&#x27;m not sure it is worth spending more for this particular model over the basic one, or even any higher priced model with other optional brushing means, if you simply want a good electric toothbrush that with regular use is going to provide excellent hygiene. I&#x27;ll keep it just to see if indeed my teeth do become the so-called two shades whiter, but coffee, occasional red wine, and hot or iced tea stains are still part of my regimen. Like a dentist once told me, keep up with drinking those, no point in paying for a whitening treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last thought, the brushes appear to be the same construction, so again, what makes this one promote whiter teeth than the standard modest model?</li>
    <li> So far so good. The quality is there. The only think left to see is how long the rechargeable battery lasts.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is awesome. If you&#x27;re considering buying it, my suggestion is to GO FOR IT. Honestly, you won&#x27;t regret it! Initially, I couldn&#x27;t fathom buying a toothbrush for this amount of money...after all I get a free one from my dentist office anyway so how much of a difference could there be? Let me tell you, it makes a huge difference! After my first use I could not stop smiling and admiring my teeth in the mirror. They looked so shiny and clean! My gums have gotten so much healthier since using this brush--pink just like they&#x27;re supposed to be. Every time I use this, it feels like I just got done at a cleaning from the dentist. I can&#x27;t get enough of that feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature that I truly love is the Quadpacer, which lets you know every thirty seconds to switch areas of brushing. It helps me make sure that all my teeth are getting equal attention! I use the Clean &amp; White selection (which adds an additional 30 seconds for your front teeth) when I have time but I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know whether my teeth are really more white. I accidentally used the Sensitive selection once and thought that it was nice and would be excellent for anyone who wants a little bit gentler brushing, but I prefer the normal setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell you how much I love this toothbrush. It is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever splurged on and I look forward to brushing my teeth twice every day! Love it!</li>
    <li> I was recommended this brush by my Dental Hygienist as it would help between cleanings. I have already noticed a difference in the cleaning of my teeth and the overall cleanliness of my mouth after brushing. It has a 30 second timer to let you know when to change sections in the mouth. It also has a sensitive mode for those who have gum irritation. It is well worth the money to invest in a quality toothbrush!!!</li>
    <li> This is pretty much the same as the Oral B electric toothbrushes.  On a full charge, this Philips brush lasts for just over a week.  I imagine that with enough time, that battery life will diminish.  There are different modes for whitening and gentle brushing.  The brush also alerts you when to change sides brushing (i.e. quadpacer).  I like the travel accessories that it comes with but it&#x27;s probably too bulky for extended travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something else that people may not be aware of is that you only need 1 brush for the whole family.  Just have a separate brushead for each person.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth and this brush is perfect. I don&#x27;t even need the sensitive setting (which is the reason I bought this one) as it&#x27;s gentle, but gives a thorough clean. Plus, I love that the toothbrush alerts you when it&#x27;s time to move to the next section. Great feature. Plus, the carrying case it comes with is a great addition for traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this after close to a month using its inexpensive competitor, a $40 Oral-B product that didn&#x27;t do much besides spin and vibrate.  The difference between that product and this one was light and day.  You can actually feel the pulses dislodging building up on your teeth.  It&#x27;s a powerful brush!  The 30-second timer is extremely useful as well although their &amp;#34;whitening and polishing mode&amp;#34; simply adds an additional 30-seconds to the original 2 minutes of normal mode.  I wouldn&#x27;t call that much of a feature personally.</li>
    <li> I liked this toothbrush.  I have seen my teeth turn a shade or two lighter and brighter!!  My teeth feel clean too!!</li>
    <li> There was a time when I could purchase a Sonicare Toothbrush and it would last for seven years. I guess those days are over. Just purchased this toothbrush in September, 2013 and the battery died today (less than a year from purchase.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just talkin&#x27; about my toothbrush, Mama! Seriously, this thing changed my life. I have absolutely no complaints/regrets since switching from &amp;#34;analog&amp;#34; brushes about five months ago. Everything about this baby is great. I love the sensitive mode for when I get a canker sore. I love the standard mode for everyday brushing. And I really love the &#x27;whitening&#x27; mode, which basically just adds 15 seconds of heavier brushing at the end of the cycle for the top/bottom front of your teeth. It actually did make my teeth a little whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May I suggest you read the manual? This thing is pretty complicated and there is a useful &amp;#34;rampup&amp;#34; feature that starts the first 15 or so of the brushings off with gradually increasing strength, because you&#x27;re going to have to get used to the intensity of this baby. It&#x27;s like the Hitachi Magic Wand for your teeth.</li>
    <li> The packaging was fine and the item arrived in a timely manner.  The base is less substantial than previous models, but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - hold the toothbrush and keep the battery recharged.  I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is the second Sonic Care I have purchased. The first one lasted forever.  ( 7 or 8 years) They are well worth the investment. They also make great gifts.</li>
    <li> This is my third toothbrush Sonicare, I really like how it works, but its engine lasts exactly one year! Should I get a new one every year? How about warranty?</li>
    <li> Much nicer than the brand I previously used. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great brushing experience, on-off button postion a little awarkard. Break in period built in design was a great ideal. Good product!</li>
    <li> My previous Sonicare died after several years of dependable use and i replaced it with this one. Cleaner design with an additional brushing mode. Same good teeth cleaning.</li>
    <li> Love it! I&#x27;m using just for 1 week and my teeth never felt so clean! I can&#x27;t tell yet about its durability, but so far so good!</li>
    <li> I was highly amazed how great this toothbrush is, I feel like I left the dentist office after a cleaning ever time I use it. If you don&#x27;t have one of these get one, it is the best!!:)</li>
    <li> Works good, and I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> So far I like it better than previous model. Does an excellent job of cleaning your teeth.</li>
    <li> This is a 3 speed toothbrush system. If you love a vigorous brushing this thing has the power. It also has 2 other higher speeds...</li>
    <li> I wish the price was lower. This is an unopened brand new product with travel case. Bought it for my child age 10 years old. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I can tell a difference in my teeth after only using this once. My dentist always told me to get one but I thought they were just product pushing. Turns out, it really is awesome. Holds a charge for quite a while. Brush heads are pricey but my teeth feel great.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush stopped working after 1 year and 2 months. It&#x27;s a shame because the previous Sonicare toothbrush I had lasted 8 years.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for user reviews.  I was just about to replace my Sonicare that died (after 10 years of use!) with the same model but I read a review touting the Healthywhite as less maintenance, because you don&#x27;t have to periodically clean out the inside cavity of the brush head (an icky job!) The Healthywhite does an even better job on my teeth and the snap-in brush head with no cavity to clean out is fantastic.  We&#x27;ll see if this model lasts more than a decade the way the old one did!</li>
    <li> Had to get rid of my old Sonicare after I could no longer find replacement heads for it. This is slimmer and easier to handle than the old one, and the heads have a much smaller base than the old ones. Am very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush for several reasons: it has a much small head than my previous Sonicare, there&#x27;s no clunky head to keep clean or which can get yucky. However, what I find odd about this one is that you can only adjust the settings after it is on and in your mouth. I have to use the Sensitive setting, which is the middle setting, but it defaults to the Clean mode. So after its on, and in my mouth I have to change the setting, but since it&#x27;s in use, it&#x27;s difficult to figure out if I&#x27;ve switched to the lower setting or not. It&#x27;s weird that you can only change the settings after it is on and in your mouth. I didn&#x27;t read all the reviews so I don&#x27;t know if this is mentioned by others or not. Of course, this isn&#x27;t an. Issue if you are happy with the default setting, but it is a problem if you want to change to either the Sensitive or  or Clean and White modes.</li>
    <li> The woman in my life is VERY happy with it. I ordered the travel case for it which she opened first. Then discovered a case came in the package with the tooth brush. Oh well. I believe in back-ups. Not sure if I missed that in the product &amp;#34;what&#x27;s in the box&amp;#34; description.</li>
    <li> I was a bit skeptical when I spent $100 on a toothbrush but ever since my first use, I&#x27;ve never looked back. My mouth has never cleaner and my gums have never looked healtheir. If you&#x27;re looking for a new toothbrush, look no further. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going back to a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Seems to have more pep than my previous Braun electric I replaced.  Brushing seems more vigorous.  Went for almost a month before needing a recharge.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this toothbrush, the battery life is great.  I usually go longer than a week on a charge brushing twice a day.  The case is compact and clean.</li>
    <li> I really like this brush and so does my dental hygienist.  My teeth stay cleaner and this really helps regularly brush correctly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve compared so many models, read most of reviews on this one. After using 2 weeks,it really make my teeth smooth and clean!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel fresh-from-the-dentist-clean! It&#x27;s pretty quiet as you are using it.  It took me a minute to get used to it as this was my first Sonicare brush.  It was a little intense at first because I jumped immediately to the clean and white mode. If you have never used an electric toothbrush, just use the regular mode first. It slowly transitions you to being comfortable with the brush; apparently the first few brushings are at a lower speed.  Once I got used to it, it&#x27;s great!  Also, be sure to pop the brush head off every once in awhile and wipe away any toothpaste that collects underneath it.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it and my teeth feel great!</li>
    <li> I used to own one of the deluxe Sonicare models that cost over $200, but it failed after four years of use. I find this less expensive model does the same except it doesn&#x27;t have the bells and whistles that I never used anyway. It does make a sound to signal you to move to the next row of teeth, and the head is flexible. The head is less flexible than the expensive models, which could be an issue if you press hard when you brush, so I just hold it with two fingers and make sure not to press hard.</li>
    <li> Even several months after my last cleaning my teeth feel freshly cleaned. The built in timer keeps you on track and the different brushing modes allow you to choose the style of cleaning you desire. I like the third setting that starts with a good cleaning and finishes up with a polishing for the front teeth.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush to replace a Braun model that was beginning to cut the inside of my mouth. This Philips model is much better than the Braun. It cleans just as well and is much easier to clean up afterwards with no crevices to catch the toothpaste.</li>
    <li> After only using the sonicare one time my teeth felt cleaner than they had ever felt even after leaving the dentist they never felt this good I switched to this because my gums always bleed badly even so much the last time they cleaned my teeth they couldn&#x27;t polish them because of to much blood the sonicare I&#x27;m hoping will heal my gums and take care of the tartar causing the bleeding anyway I&#x27;m very pleased with the clean feeling they leave on my teeth worth every penny!!!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth every penny.  A fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, arrived with all components as expected. The vibrations stimulate the plaque buildup on the teeth, and when the plaque gets excited it falls right off and you feel very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned - great product dentist recommended and teeth feel very clean when used eith a newer nrush head.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrushes for about twenty years now. I&#x27;ve used many different brands and various models, but this one is by far is the best. My teeth have never felt cleaner and already look whiter after only a few brushes.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! I had a Sonicare that I used for years. About a year ago, it quit working and I just went back to a regular toothbrush. After my last dental appointment, I realized I needed a Sonicare again. My teeth are already feeling so much cleaner....all due to my Sonicare!</li>
    <li> First I have to say that this product does a wonderful job of cleaning my teeth, and I prefer it to a number of other brands out there. As far as electric toothbrushes go I feel like they have the technology down. This unit does come with a travel case, and a good charger stand, so don&#x27;t spend your money buying one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say they got a few things wrong on this one. The unit ships with a case, and a hard bristle brush. I do not know of a single dentist that recommends using a hard brush on anything but your shoes. They can be very bad for your enamel, and bad for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other large problem I have with this model, is you can not pause the unit without cycling through all of the modes. I know you are supposed to brush for two minutes, but I often like to rinse in between, and having to press the button three times, is a bit annoying, especially for something that I&#x27;m going to use at least three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance easily rates at five stars, but the design issues and having to go out and immediately purchase a new head drop this toothbrush down to a three.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used Sonicare systems for years, then stopped for about 6 years because I have only one outlet in my bathroom.  Am glad I went back.  One brushing and my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve had a professional cleaning!  The unit is much more streamlined now, too, and looks easier to keep clean.</li>
    <li> Do not buy. An inferior product. Battery does not hold up over time making the brush worthless.</li>
    <li> been using it for three weeks and I do know I will never go back to anything else! I am so happy to get it recommended, and thanks to the fast delivery I am now &amp;#34;on another level of quality&amp;#34; in brushing my teeth</li>
    <li> By far the best toothbrush out there. the Travel box/kit is the cherry on top. easy to use though it may take a day or two to get use to the strong vibration (doesn&#x27;t hurt your gum!). The three level works great and gives you more options. I have used it for two weeks now and my teeth feel clean throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Friend bought this for herself a while ago and she told me how much she really enjoyed this electric toothbrush... also that it helped her with whitening...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time using it... not being used to brushing with an electric toothbrush... i thought the vibrations were very overpowering... but after a few uses you get used to it... and it more or less didn&#x27;t bother me anymore...&lt;br /&gt;i love the three settings of this toothbrush... you can either just brush regularly... brush using a sensitive teeth setting... and the one i use the most is the whitening program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening program is very clever and really helps you time your brushes much more efficiently so that you can get a more even cleaning. This confused me in the beginning but its actually quite easy after you get used to it... The toothbrush will time how long you clean each quadrant and will pause its vibrations when it wants you to move to the next section of your teeth... after u finish the four quarters of your mouth... it will do an additional 30 seconds for your front upper and lower teeth to whiten that area (which shows the most to people).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that i can see a slight change in my teeth... but nothing drastic. Still I am very satisfied with this purchase</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd such unit I purchased--it was for our adult son.  It is ever so much better than the battery operated units I had been using---and THEY were ever so much better than just doing the job by myself.  Since I started using special &#x27;teethbrush&#x27; (why not? One tooth, several teeth; one toothbrush, or one for all of &#x27;em--a &#x27;teethbrush&#x27;?),  three years ago, I&#x27;ve not had any cavities. A first!</li>
    <li> Great electric toothbrush ! Should have bought this years ago ! Love the various brushing speeds and options! Buy this one!</li>
    <li> I ordered this by other&#x27;s reviews, but it vibrates a LOT on all three speeds and with me having all crowns from lossing my teeth after cancer treatments it might be too powerful for my use....not for sensitive teeth!!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t get what I was missing out on until I bought one of these. My teeth have never been cleaner. After using the &#x27;whitening&#x27; mode for a couple of weeks, my teeth are noticeably whiter. Considering I am sipping tea or coffee nearly every waking moment, this is a pretty significant feat.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> The best out there, even the dentist comments on how clean the teeth are. Has a timer so you know when it is time to stop brushing. Super easy to change out the brush.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I do feel like I need more time to brush, so I just start the cycle over and do it again. But I don&#x27;t mind and actually like knowing that I am brushing long enough.  My dentist has noticed a difference and I got a great check up the other day. Overall, would totally recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Sonicare Advance for several years now and been highly satisfied with it. I was thrilled at the opportunity to try a newer model. These toothbrushes all beat a manual toothbrush hands down for superior cleaning. My teeth and mouth feel cleaner, and keep that feeling longer with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s an option for 3 different speeds if you want to ease into teeth whitening mode. I still don&#x27;t think I would recommend this for someone with sensitive gums, or if you bleed a lot during brushing and so forth. A lot of dentists push the Rotodent and I don&#x27;t personally care for it. It&#x27;s too gentle IMO and I don&#x27;t feel like my teeth are getting clean. The timer is a nice touch since it reminds you to move to a new quadrant every 30 seconds. If you just move around your mouth for the 2 minutes, you may find that part annoying. It charges well and holds the charge for a long time. I like to let it run for a couple of weeks until the battery gives out completely, then charge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say whether this actually whitens teeth. My teeth are already pretty white due to luck, regular cleanings and personal habits. I haven&#x27;t noticed anyone being blinded by the glare of my smile recently, but maybe that will take longer or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this model is that if you load it with toothpaste and then turn it on, toothpaste goes everywhere. I dare you to try it; it&#x27;s like washing your dog. Put it against your teeth before turning it on and it won&#x27;t go all over the mirror or your clothes. The brush heads are 3 per pack and seem to be a good value. This is a great model at a great price, and when I buy new brushes for family, this will be the one.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush, holds a charge for days, and my teeth feel cleaner than with a regular brush</li>
    <li> Have had several of these things over the years. They always brush real well and remind you how you aren&#x27;t brushing long enough with the built in timer. This one disappoints because there is no where to store the brush so you end up keeping it attached to the unit which makes it less than ideal. Keeping it separate is a better design because it doesn&#x27;t drip all paste and debris back onto the unit.</li>
    <li> Great Product, we have Sonicare  toothbrushes for all in the family. Not a bad price for the quality of the product.</li>
    <li> Really does a good job cleaning my teeth, but haven&#x27;t tried the Sonicare on my bridge.  I switched from using a Braun electric toothbrush because the replacement heads I liked became hard to find.  My son uses a Sonicare and highly recommends it too.  He has gotten glowing results that haven&#x27;t gone unnoticed by his dentist.  I have a checkup in a month and wonder if they can tell much difference.  I think the high speed of the brush head also massages the gums which is important.</li>
    <li> My first Phillips Sonicare lasted 3 years and gave up the ghost last week.  I replaced it with the same model since it&#x27;s the best brush system I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, but so is an unnecessary visit to the dentist.</li>
    <li> I compared several brands and series of electric toothbrush before buying this one, fortunately i bought. It really works. I used it for two weeks and found my front teeth a little white, so I keep going. Yes, it does whiten my teeth, although it is not very very quickly and obvious, but it the most healthy way.</li>
    <li> Works well.  User controls are easier to use vs the old model.  Uses the same brush as last model.  Arrived on time.</li>
    <li> This replaces an old sonicare essence that still works but the handle was getting yellow, and I didn&#x27;t want to use  the big replacement heads anymore. I really like the Healthywhite, I ordered a oral-B but did not like it at all (to loud and I didn&#x27;t like the spinning brush)&lt;br /&gt;Returned the oral-B for the Healthywhite</li>
    <li> This is probably my 4 th Sonicare.  The batteries don&#x27;t last forever, however.  I feel that my teeth get a great cleaning.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare.  I loved the first one for years until I dropped it on a tile floor.  It still worked, but didn&#x27;t hold the toothbrush sturdy anymore.  So, I purchased this one and it works just as well, but I don&#x27;t like the way you turn it on an off. It has three settings, but depending on the one you choose, you either have to push it once, twice or three times to turn it off! That&#x27;s a little tricky when it&#x27;s in your mouth. I wish it just had an off button so I don&#x27;t have to guess to turn it off.  It&#x27;s annoying. I would definitely buy a Sonicare again, but not this model.</li>
    <li> Pretty good toothbrush. Only drawback it having to press the button multiple times to get to the setting you want. Is prefer if there was one on/off button and one button for settings.</li>
    <li> terrific toothbrush.  Easy to clean and very small</li>
    <li> great buy and $30 less than in store.Thanks</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t last very long. Batteries die.  The Phillips Sonicare customer support is atrocious (though they were easy to reach).  I&#x27;m going to try an OralB.</li>
    <li> First time I used it I felt like my whole skull was vibrating...not in a good way. Second, third etc. time, I don&#x27;t know how I ever brushed without it! It gets behind the last molars with no effort on my part. Just hold it in place and it does all the work for me!</li>
    <li> Great product. Just get used to it for a while then it works for a healthier teeth. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This was bought as a replacement for my old toothbrush.  It works just like my old one and I love both of them.  I had other choices, but chose this one again because of features like timed brushing, and a whitening cycle as well as a sensitive setting!  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this toothbrush.  It cleans teeth really well leaving them shinny and smooth.  Easy instructions and fast charge.</li>
    <li> The attached tag does not match the performance. It broke twice in one year. The vibration is weak. The teeth can never get fully cleaned. There is more into the look than its performance.</li>
    <li> BEST $100 I HAVE SPENT IN A LONG LONG TIME! my teeth are polished. They are healthier, shinier for sure and after a week of using it I got a compliment from someone looking at my teeth outside in the sunlight saying they were white.  This definitely cleans your teeth better than you ever could and its quality made. No cheap s***. My boyfriend bought one 5 days after I had mine. Also my secret was that I upgraded the brush heads to the ones used on the more expensive model. You can buy them separately and they are the \\&quot;intercare\\&quot; ones. Do it!  Plus it comes with a case and you can put both the brush head you got with it in there and another head as well. Amazing.</li>
    <li> The Healthywhite handle has virtually the same internals and power as Sonicare&#x27;s  more expensive offerings without adding features most of us may not need-like a &amp;#34;charging glass.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare gives us one &amp;#34;ProResults&amp;#34; Brush head here. I used it for a couple of days and then replaced it with the Diamond Clean brush head. The difference in the quality and efficiency of the Diamond Clean head was immediate- It has a denser pattern of bristles, feels smoother on the teeth and gums and after about 5 days, it looks like I just got back from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Sonicare correctly tells us that the ProResults head is 2X better than a manual brush and that the Diamond Clean is 7X better- and that the Diamond Clean is it&#x27;s their BEST brush head.  Amazon&#x27;s current partner for the Diamond Clean heads is excellent- I ordered the 3 pack with standard shipping and received them in two days. Buy a 3 pack of Diamond Clean heads to make your Sonicare Healtywhite the best.&lt;br /&gt; Enjoy</li>
    <li> This was actually a gift for my daughter because I&#x27;ve loved my Sonicare for many years.  The part that left a taste in my mouth was when I checked online a few days later it was $10.00 less than I paid for mine.  That wasn&#x27;t very nice</li>
    <li> This is not as good as I expected. I do not like the fact that when you turn it on the whole upper part, not just the head, will vibrate. when it does that and hit your teeth it makes you feel uncomfortable. I will go back purchasing Oral B products.</li>
    <li> I always liked my Sonicare, though a little after 2 years it stopped working (a bit out of warranty). I web-chatted up support really late at night, and with not pestering they arranged an exchange free of charge, including shipping both ways. They even shipped right away without requiring my CC or the defective handle arriving first. I was not expecting this, so I figured they deserved a 5 star review.  Oh and it&#x27;s a great brush though everyone&#x27;s already talking about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is if you are one of those people (sometimes me) who is too impatient to brush the whole two minutes, you basically have to click three more times to cycle through the different modes to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also have to buy the somewhat expensive replacement heads every 3-6 months.... I went 1.5 years before changing, and my hygienist could tell... Once I bought a bunch of new heads from Costco, it became immediately apparent that a fresh brush is much more effective.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice.  Tip to using is don&#x27;t bear down.  Just hold in place on an up angle to side of teeth/gum line and let the sonic vibration do the work.  Massages your gums and feels great, too.  I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Sonicare toothbrush for many years. This is my 3rd one purchased.  Definitely worth it.  I even take it with me if I go away.  Teeth don&#x27;t feel the same without it.  I&#x27;m 46 yrs old and never had a cavity.</li>
    <li> My dentist told me to get one with the &amp;#34;snap on&amp;#34; head technology, not the screw on heads. This replaced a previous Sonicare that I had (it was screw on, not snap). It does a good job of getting my teeth clean - however to use the whitening mode, you have to select it every time.</li>
    <li> love the product and maybe its just me but I can&#x27;t hear the &amp;#34;Beep&amp;#34; to change the position of the toothbrush in my mouth.</li>
    <li> This replaces my 10+ year old Philips.  It has 3 powers, overkill in my opinion as the brush turns on to &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; at a high rate of quiver and is all I wanted.  To turn it off, one has to push the start button twice to rotate through the other cycles, thus turning it off.  I very much like the smaller diameter handle and the tiny charger stand (especially for travel).  Am annoyed with Philips as there is no model identification on the brush or charger to replicate what one wants.  I had purchased my husband&#x27;s replacement about 2 years ago, and his version was all that I wanted, but it was nowhere to be found!  Might have been the lowest priced one, but the description did not support being the same as what I purchased 2 years ago!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush. Now after using it for over a year, I would say that my teeth are not clean without it. The feeling after brushing my teeth with it is great. My gum used to bleed a bit when using a normal tooth brush but after using this, my gum health improved a lot and I do NOT have that bleeding anymore. Just a great product for the health of your teeth and mouth. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended me to get a sonicare, I feel like I am bruising my teeth longer now due to the timer. I can feel my teeth are much cleaner and my mouth feels healthier.</li>
    <li> yes this is recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> [---Quick Summary---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sonicare is portable and lightweight without adding too much to a &#x60;cheapness&#x27; feel. Although it is mostly plastic it feels fairly well made. The toothbrush head is smaller than I typically buy, and prefer (the Sonicare does not come with a full-size head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will tickle when first using however you get used to the feeling very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simplistic charging, carrying case that fits the body and brush head only.  Price feels a little more expensive than the electric toothbrush is worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: 7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Encased in plastic and slightly heavy which is good so that it does not vibrate the hand while using. Comes with a small charging &#x60;dock&#x27; which simply has a &#x60;stick&#x27; that protrudes out which you sit the toothbrush on--very simplistic and appropriate for not taking much space on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.5/10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has 3 settings to use that are timed internally on the toothbrush. They change between &#x60;teeth whitening mode&#x27;, normal clean, and &#x60;sensitive&#x27;. In teeth whitening mode, for example, it expects you to brush for 2 minutes where you alternate sides of your teeth for 30 seconds a piece (they label your mouth as having 4 sections). After the 2 minute mark it will turn into the teeth whitening function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latter is a little to mechanical and procedural for me and thus I ended up using it as normal with it turned on. **For this it actually did whiten the teeth a bit more so than using the manual toothbrush. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[---Final Thoughts---]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little more expensive then I feel it is worth however it is a solidly packed, small-sized, tooth brush that is very portable. It does well at &#x60;precision&#x27; cleaning as compared to manually using a toothbrush because it loosens any particles on your teeth better than doing it by hand. For better cleaning, this electric toothbrush will be the choice for you. Just know you will giggle the first few times you use it.l giggle the first few times you use it.</li>
    <li> Gets my teeth so clean, they feel like little pearls. Takes a minute to get used to, but after the first brushing I was hooked. My teeth are getting whiter too. Seems like a luxury item because of the price, but when you think of all the money you&#x27;ll save on the whitening strips and other stuff, this is actually a great buy.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  This is the second one I have bought!  I love how clean it gets your teeth!  Even better when I go to the dentist for a cleaning, they hardly have anything to do!!!  FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> Does a thorough job, like any Sonicare. Not sure I like the three speed settings because you have to click a lot to get to the setting you want and/or turn off the toothbrush. But you cannot beat Sonicare for a great-feeling dental cleaning and great checkups with the dentist.</li>
    <li> Ok, let me just say after 8 months I love it but with one issue.  I may be applying too much pressure but I recently noticed my brush attachment has more play/loose then when I bought it. It still has that great brushing action but its lose and bends a few degrees when I apply pressure to brush teeth.  I think I wore out a bushing or something but hope it keeps working until for a bit longer.  Probably will buy the new model after reading other reviews.</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush. My dentist recommended it and I got it and love it. It times your brushing so it is easy to know how long to brush.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for another Phillips Sonicare model. We have had many of these over many years and like them very much. At one point we tried another brand, but quickly returned to Sonicare.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my first time formally switch to electric toothbrush. Earlier, I had bought one but could not get used to it. Now I know I should switch to modern technology.&lt;br /&gt;I felt very weird during the first several times, but gradually fully get used to it. I started with sensitive mode, gradually switched to clean (normal) mode, and finally started to use clean and white mode on evening. The 30-second notification helps a lot in forming a good tooth-brushing habit, so that you wont&#x27;s miss any parts, especially the inner side, of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;One of the disadvantages is that the toothpaste would go everywhere while brushing the teeth. I applied toothpaste to teeth before turning it on, but it will still spill to some random places while brushing. Not sure whether it&#x27;s because my way of brushing is suboptimal.</li>
    <li> Needs a little plastic holder for the heads (so they stand up-right). For almost $100, I do not want to have to create this myself.</li>
    <li> This is a very well thought-out product. It gets your teeth very clean, and is good for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cost more than the E-Series, but the way the head fits on is superior, and much less prone to trapping stuff inside. Also, the heads are more low profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to place on the charging base, stands up by itself quite well, also includes a little bump that keeps it from rolling onto the side when you lay it on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hold a charge very well, and when I travel for a few days, I don&#x27;t bother bringing a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can&#x27;t turn it off while using it without it starting it&#x27;s program over. These have 2-minute timers on them (or 2 - 1/2 minutes in the &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; mode), but they reset when you turn them off. My old one didn&#x27;t have this problem. So you could stop and spit, then resume where you left off. Strange that they took this function away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My process:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. rinse my mouth with water&lt;br /&gt;2. floss&lt;br /&gt;3. rinse again&lt;br /&gt;4. brush for 2 minutes with Sonicare (I don&#x27;t do one quadrant at a time, rather I move it around constantly - because otherwise it tickles too much)&lt;br /&gt;5. rinse again&lt;br /&gt;6. clean brush head and place back in charger (I don&#x27;t use the little plastic cover for the brush as it tends to get dirty and hold moisture against the bristles so they don&#x27;t ever dry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Cleans teeth very well&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts for many years&lt;br /&gt;-Replacement heads are readily available, even at Costco&lt;br /&gt;-Great for travel (mine included a travel case)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Can&#x27;t stop midway through brushing without resetting the timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve tried other electric toothbrushes, or if you have an E-Series Sonicare, or if you&#x27;ve never used an electric brush, you&#x27;ll be amazed at how good this is. I was worried when Philips bought Sonicare, but this is a very well-made, reliable, effective product. Makes a huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - would like to have given this 4-1/2 stars, but opted for a conservative rating.</li>
    <li> ok I wish the head was a little larger but the size does get to the back of your teeth well</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I last used a Sonicare, and I forgot how clean it makes my teeth/whole mouth feel! I also feel like it helps protect my gums. I can&#x27;t tell if this more expensive version is worth the money over the less expensive one, but I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
    <li> Nice quality very strong</li>
    <li> A great brush, one exception: I have read other complaints about shaft loosening and starting to buzz, reduced effective power - this one is doing it not one year after purchase; maybe warranty service.</li>
    <li> The main part is rather thick and difficult to hold.  Otherwise, it works fine.  I would not purchase this again though.</li>
    <li> My teeth saver! A must buy!</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive one previously and I like this one just as well.</li>
    <li> Loving my new toothbrush and really like the feature that tells me when to move to the next quadrant - funny but true - like any other guy I of course didn&#x27;t read any directions so thought either it was malfunctioning or that I was hitting the power button by mistake - it was not until maybe 3 weeks into it that I realized it&#x27;s 3 power interruptions meant I was to move to the next set of teeth and after the 4th it shuts off automatically - i kept thinking i was hitting the power button. Oh and love how easy it is to set back on the charger, it doesn&#x27;t have to click or attache just line up to the pin holder and you&#x27;re good to go. Only minor draw back was the long power cord. I only needed 10&amp;#34; from counter to plug but it comes with probably 20&amp;#34; of cord which i had to wrap &amp; tie and it messes with my bathroom ascetics a bit.</li>
    <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Sonicare. It is without question the best powered toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Philips Sonicare is the best toothbrush on the market.  I have been using a Sonicare for 15 years and would not think of going back to a manual brush or battery type.</li>
    <li> seems to work well however this is the second one as the first one broke</li>
    <li> I actually find my self brushing much longer because it is so gentle on the teeth and gums, very easy to get all the hard to reach places and my teeth feel sooooo clean afterwards.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> this new model made easy to clean Toothbrush self, I have the old one for many years and got this new one recently. this time I ordered again for my husband since it is really work well for many way plus it comes with a travel case, very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> Because of the three settings you get a professional feeling of a complete cleansing.I would recommend this product to all.</li>
    <li> I had extensive dental work----crowns----this is a perfect toothbrush to keep the plaque in check.  Dental hygenist  was pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  Leaves your teeth feeling very clean.  Also like the 2 minute timing feature that encourages the proper brushing time.</li>
    <li> This was a gift purchase. My friend was excited to receive it and told me it was wonderful. She loves it.</li>
    <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t had it longer than a few days, but really I feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist every time I use it. People keep saying it dies after a year, but it had a warranty and if you register it then you should be able to get it replaced with no problem if you keep the proof of purchase and receipt. Truly the best use of my money for a toothbrush. I was skeptical about buying a $100 toothbrush, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. The first time I used it I was most impressed. My teeth were already clean and it felt a million times cleaner after. It really does feel like you just left the dentist every time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few days and after first use I felt as if I&#x27;d just been to the dentist for a cleaning! I am so happy I purchased this Sonicare and I have already recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> So amazingly perfect. My teeth are so happy. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could choose one thing to be stranded on a desert island with, it would be this Sonicare... Darn, no electricity!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, if you are lucky enough to have electricity, this toothbrush is a must-have.... seriously! It cleans teeth, and the gum-line, like nothing else. This newer model is a nice improvement over my older model Sonicare. Slimmer handle is easier to grasp easily and the charging station is &amp;#34;gunk-proof&amp;#34;... there are no crevices that can get mucky over time. Also, the charging station is very petite and minimalist, taking up practically no room at all on my counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning capability is stellar, and having the choice of gentle or vigorous &amp;#34;deep clean&amp;#34; is nice also. I am not crazy about the vibrating feeling in my head when using this brush, but it is worth it to prevent periodontal disease. And works much better and faster than brushing teeth manually. There is no comparison. Of course, teeth are whiter over time using Sonicare, than just brushing by hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparkly white, clean teeth and minty fresh breath... what more could I ask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also... very durable. My last Sonicare lasted forever (still works, but I got tired of it and wanted an upgraded version).</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the one I&#x27;d had before. Same model but earlier year. Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it. I like clean teeth. This brush delivers.</li>
    <li> Okay, I did just get this toothbrush this week, but I love it already! It has a quadrant notification...so you start in one section of your mouth and it will buzz when it is time to move to another section.  I use the Clean &amp; White setting, and could see a difference after the first.  And no irritated gums like some other electric toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush!! Teeth feel dentist clean after each use.</li>
    <li> Our 2nd one. Very happy - Dentist bills for whole family prove it. Brush is exactly as the manufacturer describes it. Battery charge last whole week for family of 4.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist and I can understand why. Your teeth feel wonderfully clean and your gums massaged.</li>
    <li> Can really feel it clean my teeth. They are whiter in two weeks. Im happy with it.I recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace one that had broken and it works like a champ.</li>
    <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;First time using feels like I walked out of dentist.  I just replaced an automatic toothbrush Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazing, love soft bristles and modes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;issues&lt;br /&gt;  -Button is too low, I click where there is no button. (my first day)&lt;br /&gt;  -To turn off, I have to click button 3x.</li>
    <li> let me start out by saying, i&#x27;m not a big power tooth brush fan, but after using this tooth brush, i must say WOW!. I literally feel like l&#x27;ve went to the dentist office to get my teeth clean.  On a manual tooth brush, my teeth has never felt this clean. I&#x27;m not exaggerating either. If you plan on purchasing this tooth brush, get it you wouldn&#x27;t go wrong. I give this a 5 because its easy simple to use. My biggest problem with buying this tooth brush was the clean of the tooth brush head after long time use with corrosion. This tooth brush doesn&#x27;t have this problem because the detachable head does not have any holes for the water to enter and thats a plus. The detachable head is also easy to remove and clean. All the other features are true. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> Love. I don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it. Worth every dime.</li>
    <li> Product works as described. I just do not like the feel on my teeth. I have had previous models that did not impact me in the same manner. I find I do not like to use it.</li>
    <li> It does what it says it will do: cleans your teeth by removing the plaque and leaves them smooth to the tongue&#x27;s touch. There is no need to apply pressure and in fact doing so can and will cause sore gum issues. Let the toothbrush do its work and you&#x27;ll be completely satisfied. There is no need for anything beyond this model number. More expensive Philips brushes are simply bells and whistles which will not provide a better cleaning experience. I love mine and with my sensitive gums I bought the sensitive brush heads to go with it.</li>
    <li> Although this is not my favorite electric toothbrush, it is still an excellent electric toothbrush and deserves a 5-star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-HealthyWhite three brushing modes (Clean, Clean and White, and Sensitive)&lt;br /&gt;-Quadpacer - 30 second interval timer that briefly pauses to let you know it is time to move on to the next quadrant&lt;br /&gt;-Travel charger - nice and compact; good for travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like or care for:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy start - This is supposed to \\&quot;gently\\&quot; increases power over the first 14 uses to ease you into the Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush experience.  I am already used to an electric toothbrush, so I actually thought this Sonicare was underpowered at first... until I realized it was supposed to be this way.&lt;br /&gt;-Did not come with full/larger charger base.  I had a Sonicare prior to owning my current toothbrush, a [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]] (which is my current favorite toothbrush, BTW)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about claim that it can whiten \\&quot;up to two shades in two weeks.\\&quot;  I tried this Sonicare for almost a month, but I did not see a difference.  However, I already use a [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare DiamondClean]], so I suppose I will not be able to see any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent electric toothbrush.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I was a little reluctant to drop $100 on a toothbrush.  My previous investment in a toothbrush was the Oral B Precision which retails for almost $50 and it was actually WORSE than the Vitality which I had owned prior to the Precision and that retails for $20 less.  I was afraid that I would be disappointed in the Sonicare as I had been with the Oral B Precision.  The Oral B Precision not only did an inferior job of brushing my teeth than the Vitality, it also leaked, stunk and accumulated burnt gunk along the base.  A friend came to visit me and had positive things to say about the Sonicare so I threw caution to the wind and invested in the Sonicare HealthyWhite Model from Phillips and WOW!  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy the Sonicare sooner.  What a difference from either of the Oral B&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did feel a little strange at first but good strange.  It is a weird pulsating vibration that sort of tingles at first.  The vibration shifts every so often to remind you that you need to shift quadrants and after 2 minutes (for the clean setting...2.5 minutes for the clean and white), it simply turns off so you know you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I finished brushing for the first time, I was amazed at how clean my mouth felt and at how much foam came out of my mouth.  I brush with toothsoap which lathers up but never as much as when I use the sonic.  I brush and floss regularly and often and thought my mouth was clean but I realize now after using the Sonicare for four days, that my mouth wasn&#x27;t as clean as I thought it was.  NOW, however, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s as clean as it can possibly be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wake up in the morning after a long night&#x27;s sleep to not even a hint of a taste of morning breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is perfect, too.  Slim and no leakage. It also comes with a cap to pop on the head to protect it when not in use.  So now airborne bacteria cannot contaminate the head when it&#x27;s charging.  It also comes with a travel case which is very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine ever going back to any other brand of toothbrush aside.  So, yeah, it&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot imagine ever going back to any other brand of toothbrush aside.  So, yeah, it&#x27;s expensive but well worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this electric toothbrush. This is my third in 12 years. Keeps my teeth and gums healthy. My hygienist says  i have less tarter build up and she recommends this electric tooth brush over other competitors. I remember when I first used a sonicare. It took me a couple of times to get used to it because it felt like it tickled my teeth. I had to apply it firmly to my teeth in order to get used to the sensation. This one comes with a charging base that last a long time off the charger giving you plenty of brushing sessions before having to recharge, but I just leave mine on the charging base. It also has different settings but I just use the whatever it is set on when I push the button. Don&#x27;t pull it out of your mouth on or you will make a nice mess with toothpaste. Hope this helps in your descision to purchase I would definitely reccommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> So far, seems to be doing a great job!!</li>
    <li> I have always used the standard toothbrush, often provided by my dentist after each check-up. The dentist office has been mentioning Sonicare for quite some time, but I just couldn&#x27;t get around the price tag for a toothbrush, no matter what the features did. But after reading what these things could do compared to my brushing technique (I&#x27;m not the best when it comes to flossing either), I thought I&#x27;d start to look into them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular model had been one I was pricing tracking for a while (kept in wish list and watched the price). A recent amazon.com &amp;#34;coupon&amp;#34; dropped the price by $10 and that made me take the jump. When it arrived, I opened it and it already had at least 50% charge (green light), so that was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first brushing with it was surreal. I&#x27;m so used to brushing manually. With this thing, you do a small bit of motion, but the vibration (and it is an intense vibration) does the rest. It seemed to vibrate my skull! The default setting was on &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; which is really what I&#x27;m after, not necessarily whitening. The whitening option adds time to the brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I really like is that it paces you and gets you to brush a solid 2 minutes. I realized just after using this a couple of times how brief I had been brushing my teeth manually. The vibration changes briefly to tell you to move to another zone in your mouth (upper or lower, front or behind teeth, etc.) and that was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll just have to see if it actually removes as much plaque as they say it will, but at least I&#x27;m brushing longer and spending more time on each tooth/area of my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pluses:&lt;br /&gt;-helps you brush for 2 minutes (recommended by dentists)&lt;br /&gt;-paces you during brushing and helps you get all the areas with prompts&lt;br /&gt;-already charged out of the box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minuses:&lt;br /&gt;-still expensive, in my opinion&lt;br /&gt;-vibration is really intense in &amp;#34;clean mode&amp;#34;; use sensitive mode if gums are touchy&lt;br /&gt;-toothbrush is really tall, easy to knock over, even in charging stand (which has small footprint)&lt;br /&gt;-only 1 brush (gotta buy more for the family).gums are touchy&lt;br /&gt;-toothbrush is really tall, easy to knock over, even in charging stand (which has small footprint)&lt;br /&gt;-only 1 brush (gotta buy more for the family).</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for a quad pacer that I had for a number of years that finally quit working.  I much prefer the design of the newer model since it doesn&#x27;t get all cruddy inside the brush head like the older models.  Also the new brushes are much less expensive than the older ones.</li>
    <li> Arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my grandson at Christmas..he is really pleased.  Nice toothbrush...yes, I recommend. I use one myself. Never go back to regular toothbrush...</li>
    <li> Go for this:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FZ2NGRC/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper if you share it with another customer.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this model.&lt;br /&gt;The most annoying part of this model is its battery indicator is stupid, you can&#x27;t tell the battery level immediately by looking at it.</li>
    <li> I love this! I am never going back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Works well and easy to use.  On the negative side, when in use it makes a noise similar to a dentist&#x27;s drill.</li>
    <li> I ordered this model to replace a previous model that was identical except it did not include a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; setting. There seems to be a big difference in quality of cleaning. The new model does not do the great job that the former model did on the &amp;#34;clean and white&amp;#34; setting that I always use. I often run the new one twice. I have used Sonicare brushes for several years - this one is my fourth - but my next one will not be a Sonicare.</li>
    <li> After 2 months of 2xdaily use it no longer works.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush ever!</li>
    <li> I have been using various Oral-B electric toothbrushes (the more basic models) for over the last 15 years and always avoided switching to Sonicare because they were more expensive.  However, I was having an issue with sensitivity due to brushing too hard and actually have the gums of a few teeth receding.  My dentist recommended that I switch over to Sonicare as they are better for sensitive gums.  I&#x27;ve had this toothbrush for about two weeks now and I can&#x27;t even verbalize how much better it is for me.  Every time I brush I feel like I am getting the after dentist clean feeling that lasts all the way until my next brushing, my teeth are whiter, my gums are less sensitive, and all of this with putting much less pressure on the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit itself if a great size.  The battery life is great (I just gave it its first charge at 13 days of use).  Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one issue is the one button that controls On/off/pause and switching between the three different cleaning modes, but I am sure it is just something that I need to get used to!</li>
    <li> good toothbrush. Purchased to replace same toothbrush that went bad.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush itself works very well, but the actual brush head is a little bit too small for an adult mouth. The bristles could also be just a tad firmer.</li>
    <li> I really like this toothbrush. It is my second one and could not wait for it to arrive. Love it Love it!</li>
    <li> well, my husband likes it ... the sound this one makes drives me up the wall, but he loves the feeling of super clean this electric provides.  i can&#x27;t use it, but my teeth are overly sensitive and my hearing is entirely too excellent to use this one myself.  the good news is that HE likes it and is very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> So far so good. My teeth definitely feel cleaners. I bought this because I like the gentle brushing option. I just have to remember to not push the brush against my teeth and let the brush do the job on it&#x27;s own too. My husband loves it too</li>
    <li> This is a great product that definitely gets my teeth much cleaner than a normal toothbrush.  It really seems to clean between the teeth better and gets rid of more food particles.  It doesn&#x27;t feel too harsh on the teeth and doesn&#x27;t irritate the gums.  It has a sensitive mode in case you need that.  I am one who does. The key to using the Sonicare is learning to let it do the work.  You don&#x27;t need to brush.  You just hold it and it does the work itself. It helps get rid of stains as well.  I recommend using for a while as you get used to it.  My dentist was very happy and said I definitely needed to be using this when I mentioned that I had one.  It is a bit pricey but it is a great quality product.</li>
    <li> I have had a Sonicare for years. I love it. It works well and it is the electric toothbrush I keep going back to.</li>
    <li> Pricey? Oh yea? Worth every penny? Oh yea. Especially if you have a periodontal disease of your gums. And 31,000 brush strokes per minute? I don&#x27;t think the human hand can produce that not hardly. It&#x27;s almost as good as getting a professional cleaning at the dentists office every time you brush. On the negative side of this post. You would think that Philips Sonicare would add more than one brush to the unit as the brush replacements are quite pricey. I guess they were not thinking about your significant other or spouse would want to get in on the game. So it leaves the buyer holding the bag of having to purchase extra brushes which I will add again are quite pricey. Would I ever go back to manual brushing again? No way.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush, this is my second one in 15 years, they last forever and the replacement heads are easy to find at Costco ! This brush is the newer version of my old one, works better, holds the charge longer, lighter and the new style brush heads seem to clean much better, Great for brushing !</li>
    <li> Dentist has never lied but once........and this wasn&#x27;t it.  This thing is well worth the money.  Your teeth feel like you just had them cleaned every time you use it and it keeps coffee stains controlled.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush.  Someone on a beauty blog said that her teeth looked whiter because of it and she was right! My teeth look whiter and feel better than they ever have.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have been using Sonicare toothbrushes for quite a few years now, having just purchased my third one.  I love the clean feel of my teeth after using it.  When my last one quit working, I thought maybe I would go back to a manual rather than pay for another Sonicare.  After using a manual for a few days, I couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore and went shopping for another Sonicare.  My only con is that I wish they lasted a little longer and/or weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Works great. I filled out the warranty and it works great.</li>
    <li> I have always been a culprit of brushing improperly. This brush buzzes every 30 seconds to remind you to switch to a different quadrant of your mouth. The &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t an audio tone, its actually a change in the vibration pattern . very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your first electronic toothbrush, as it was mine, remember to turn it OFF before you take it out of your mouth. Or the wicked vibrations will shake toothpaste all over your T-shirt,  mirror, etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find this product to be durable and somehow 100% waterproof. I&#x27;ve run the entire toothbrush under a running faucet for cleaning and it comes out fine. The sit and charge functionality is great too, there is no metal on metal contact. ( it charges through the plastic base). This probably adda to durability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the brush heads past the point of the fading indicator, I noticed they are still firm.and reliable after their life expectancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has improved my brushing habits and will pay for itself in offset toothbrush purchases by the end of 2015</li>
    <li> vibration id too hard</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for about 2 years but I can&#x27;t prove it because I can&#x27;t find the receipt.  For the first year, it worked flawlessly.  After about a year, I started noticing that the handle was making an odd noise.  Soon after that, the brush would seem fine unless you put it against your teeth, then it would make a strange sound and the brush would stop brushing.  So much for a 2 year warranty.  Now I have an open pack of expensive but unused brush heads that fit this handle.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another one of these and see how long it lasts.  If it goes out again after only a year, my rating will drop to one star.  $120 per year ($10 a month plus those expensive brush heads) is a bit pricey.  I might be better off using a $3 manual toothbrush and visiting my dentist for a cleaning twice a year.  It would be less expensive.  :-(</li>
    <li> I purchased this a little over a month ago and although I did notice it cleaned very well and my teeth were getting whiter, the device simply stopped working.</li>
    <li> I have owned the HX6731/02 since May of 2014.  I was extremely satisfied with the toothbrush at first, but all of a sudden it stopped charging last week and I don&#x27;t know why.  My assumption is that the base is no longer working, but there should be no reason for that.  I was not able to find anything online regarding the issue, so if anyone out there has any ideas, let me know.</li>
    <li> This tooth brush got my teeth so clean I was amazed.  I have used electronic toothbrushes from the competitor for the last 10 years and finally made the switch.  This has definitely help the color of my teeth which I was skeptical of.  I recommend everyone get one of these and got a similar for my 4 year old son.</li>
    <li> The product works extremely well, it gets your teeth very clean</li>
    <li> It is attractive, easy to handle and seems to get the cleaning job done well.  I just wish it came with two brushes instead of just one.  For the price, that should not be a problem.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement purchase when our previous one finally died.  I first learned about Sonicare from my dentist in the 90s and have been a big supporter ever since.  We&#x27;ve given them to our kids as gifts and have been consistently pleased with checkup results and how good our teeth look (without any special, expensive whitening treatments) despite the aging process.  This brush, combined with Arm &amp; Hammer Whitening Toothpaste is all it takes!</li>
    <li> I like the Sonicare system, it makes my teeth feel cleaner than with any other toothbrush. There is no comparison to inexpensive electric or manual brushes for the most part. But don&#x27;t throw out your manual brush. I find that there is one HUGE flaw with all Sonicare toothbrushes--well their selection of heads really--they are all severely curved to accommodate the front of the teeth yet clearly teeth have a back as well. I find that 4 years after purchasing my Sonicare and trying all different heads, it is next to impossible to get a good cleaning behind the teeth in the front--so approximately 12 teeth total you must learn toothbrush gymnastics to get the bristles to meet the enamel sufficiently and usually that is accomplished with just the scant few bristles at the very tip of the head. I actually got more plaque build up in the back of my lower teeth until I started using my manual toothbrush a couple times a day as well.  So ... Great product; bad head design.</li>
    <li> I find this toothbrush to be very noisy but it could be j u st me. It does clean well.</li>
    <li> After 10 months of use, I heard a &#x27;click&#x27; from the unit as I was brushing and the brush action immediately became very feeble, as if the motor had lost half its power. Like so many modern products, it is impossible to take it apart, so into the trash can it goes. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that the instructions don&#x27;t clarify how the battery indicator indicates that a charge is required.  I just charge overnight every couple of weeks to make sure that the battery stays charged.</li>
    <li> Great at vibrating and getting those little bits of food i forgot to chew.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years.  Does a great job and the charge last a long tim.</li>
    <li> It works very well. It was easy to get used to.</li>
    <li> Great brush!  Great price!</li>
    <li> Still going strong on and on. Just replace your brush when it gets shaggy. Love this puppy.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Philips Sonicare toothbrush, but the first with the slender base.  I find this one lighter and easier to maneuver in my mouth.</li>
    <li> As someone who is loathe to floss [sorry Dr. Pollock], this brush has changed my dental hygiene.  I had only been  using it a few months when it was time for my yearly dental checkup.  The hygienist was complimenting me on how healthy my teeth and gums were!  I proudly told her I switched to a Philips sonic toothbrush and she said it was clearly working.  I will never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> good except the brush hair is very hard.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. This is my 3rd Sonicare so I am very familiar and fond of the product line. Feels great when I brush my teeth.  I love the 4-30 second brushing cycles plus two 15 second whitening cycles. My teeth feel clean and look whiter. Also my Dentist and Hygienist always compliment me on my hygiene.</li>
    <li> Does an amazing job...not the electric toothbrush of yesterday. My teeth feel so clean and look great. Been using since my regular cleaning, purchased at dental office.,best money spent in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have owned several of these over the  years.  My last one lasted many years before the batter just wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore. my only complaint is the toothbrushes, they always have bristles dislodge from the brush and you need to fish them out of your mouth.  On the good side I rarely get any cavities.  Brush with a regular brush and take your finger nail and scrape your front teeth and feel the plaque still on your teeth.  After using this for a  few weeks you won&#x27;t feel that anymore.</li>
    <li> Works great and definitely cleans better than a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> No complaints.  Works just like my last one (which I lost err.... left while I was away on a trip).  Charging stand is smaller and easier to tip over than my original one but that&#x27;s not a big deal.  I would have thought with the &amp;#34;Healthywhite&amp;#34; title you might get some whitening stuff with it but you just get a coupon to buy some.</li>
    <li> I really like the 3 settings you can use. &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;clean and white&amp;#34; which is the one I usually use - really has made a difference in the appearance of my teeth. As a tea drinker my teeth were looking dingy - I do not want to use whitening products as my guns are already sensitive. This is my third Sonicare electric toothbrush. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tooth brushes I have tried in my life, prices is not to cheap but it worst every penny.</li>
    <li> Not a bad brush at all, very easy to use and clean, it&#x27;s my first electric toothbrush, so take this with that in mind.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Cleans all sections of teeth.  Like the oval brushes vs. the circle/ round ones the other company makes.</li>
    <li> Our dentist recommended SonicCare to my wife and me and we finally caved in and got one. The Healthy White was the model I purchased first, because it looked like it had more \\&quot;features.\\&quot; The brush works great and my wife and I are sold on the concept now. After using SonicCare for a couple of weeks, we both feel that our teeth are, in fact, much cleaner, that our gums are getting better treatment, too.    But I think the Healthy White model was a mistake. The much cheaper Easy Clean model has just one mode -- \\&quot;Clean\\&quot; -- and that is all you need. Clean mode both on the Easy Clean and the Healthy White (and presumably on other models) gives you the 2-minute timer that beeps every 30 seconds to tell you to move to a different quadrant of your mouth. That&#x27;s excellent -- and it&#x27;s all you need. The extra features on the more expensive Healthy White are unnecessary. The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; mode is (in my opinion) utterly useless. The normal \\&quot;clean\\&quot; mode is already pretty delicate. And the \\&quot;clean and white\\&quot; mode on this model is also unnecessary. All it does it add 30 seconds to the timer. If you want to brush your teeth for more than 2 minutes using the less expensive one-mode Easy Clean model, just turn the brush back on (tap the power button) and brush away for 30 more seconds or however long you like. The Healthy White model has no other advantages.    So, four stars because I highly recommend the SoniCare system. If you persuade yourself that you really really need those extra features, God bless you. But the one I recommend is the less expensive Easy Clean model.    Addendum: Note that the brush heads have smooth &#x27;necks&#x27; as a consequence of which it can be a bit tricky to remove the head, especially if the brush is wet and a bit sudsy when you&#x27;re done brushing. I ended up buying a second brush (the Easy Clean model) so my wife and I wouldn&#x27;t have to struggle to pull the head off constantly. I think SoniCare should add a couple gripping ridges to the neck of the brush head --but I&#x27;m not taking any points off for that small design flaw.</li>
    <li> whitens teeth and makes your teeth look and feel clean</li>
    <li> This is my 6th Sonicare. They are not built for longevity - have had issues with all of them after a while. They work fine until they don&#x27;t. The last one (Healthywhite) just died after less than a year.</li>
    <li> Love, love my Sonic brushes.  I have used them for about 15 years and will never go back to regular brush.  Teeth and gums feel better and cleaner.  My dental hygenist commented that my gums looked healthier, too.  If you have gum issues, you really shaould be using Sonic!</li>
    <li> I wish I had bought a Sonicare sooner. I&#x27;m old school. Didn&#x27;t want to spend crazy money on an electric toothbrush because I didn&#x27;t think it would work. Boy was I wrong. First of all, I decided to get this model because it seemed to be priced in the middle. I also read that the higher priced ones do the exact same thing as the lower priced ones -- bottom line is they all clean your teeth. Anyway, I bought a Sonicare because my teeth were starting to stain a lot faster after my visit to the dentist that in previous years. Normal brushing and flossing weren&#x27;t doing the trick. I started to worry... Enter Sonicare. Within two weeks most of the nasty stains were gone. Sure there are some spots that will need my dentist&#x27;s touch to get rid of, but overall Sonicare did a wonderful job! Oh and I knew it was going to make a difference when after my first use, my teeth felt like they had just been cleaned by my dentist. I&#x27;m never going back to an old brush!</li>
    <li> First - nothing but compliments on how well they will clean and keep your teeth healthy.  Sonicare has literally saved my teeth and I recommend to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the 3 stars - compared to the upper end models, this one does not have a separate button to control the modes which means when it&#x27;s &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;, to get it &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; before timer ends, must awkwardly (as don&#x27;t take brush out of mouth or you have toothpaste gunk everywhere) click the button several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also minor in relation to above, I do like the charging base of the higher end models better (wrap extra cord in base) and don&#x27;t love the overall cost of having to replace the heads</li>
    <li> This toothbrush has totally changed my oral hygiene routine. It makes my teeth feel so much cleaner and even has several preprogrammed and timed settings built in. I will never go back to manual.</li>
    <li> Already seeing the benefits in whitening and plague removal after 3 days of use. Wish it came with more heads or accessories for the price.</li>
    <li> Great purchase!!  Great deal!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Good battery life</li>
    <li> These are designed to break right about the time the warranty ends (as opposed to electric razors I&#x27;ve had since the 90s that work like new). Philips customer care is a joke. A peace offering of 15% discount? Wow, thanks, Phillips. I&#x27;ll just go to Amazon and get a 20% discount. They obviously don&#x27;t care about keeping their customers happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself performs well when it works. But I really don&#x27;t like how it cuts out every 30 seconds to tell you to switch to a different zone in your mouth. I can handle the responsibility of brushing my teeth without a disconcerting weird pause in functioning.</li>
    <li> I brush too hard, so at the behest of my dentist, tried a Sonicare toothbrush and bought some extra soft sensitive brush heads.  I am impressed.  I didn&#x27;t think it was possible for anyone or anything to do a better job brushing my teeth, but I am very happy.  My health is well worth the extra cost of this toothbrush, and is has done a better (gasp!) job than I can in brushing the backsides of those teeth on the same side of the hand I brush with...  the dental hygienist has recommended these to many of her patients who brush too hard and also recommended I buy this online and not from the dentist&#x27;s office since the prices are more competitive.  That gave me confidence that her recommendation was legitimate and not to increase income for the dentist - I also checked with a couple more hygienists and they concurred that the Sonicare provides better oral care results for most patients.  Besides doing a better job, the toothbrush does the work for me.  Good product, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is my first Sonicare so I can&#x27;t compare it to other models - however I can tell you that coming from an &amp;#34;analog&amp;#34; toothbrush this has definitely made my brushing easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve always been a little skeptical about toothbrush/toothpastes that advertise teeth whitening  (I always felt that to actually get a good whitening w/o a visit to the dentist you need to use Crest Whitestripes or something of the sort...) but after a couple of weeks of using this along with a proper paste like sensodyne, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in the brightness of my smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice little travel case as well so you can take the base and two brush-heads with you wherever you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely charge it, and when I do it&#x27;s not for very long. The stand is small and has a clean design, so it&#x27;s pretty convenient to just leave the brush on there for short periods of time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month since I&#x27;ve had one and I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could get excited about a toothbrush, but I am. This is an excellent toothbrush and love the whitening feature. I see an improvement with how white my teeth are. No whitening strips needed!</li>
    <li> This my fourth Sonicare toothbrush. They are a great product. The only reason 4 stars, instead of 5, the button to turn off and on is very hard to control. I would guess that this particular one is a bit of a lemon.</li>
    <li> easily the most efficient tooth brush I have ever owned -confirmed by my  dental hygienist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was using oro  model. met all expectations</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is great!  I bought another one previous to this, very similar, same brand, but this one is even better, easier to handle with more features.  I wouldn&#x27;t use a manual toothbrush again unless I had to.  I know the difference when I have my teeth cleaned, there&#x27;s so much less plaque.  I like that fact that it tells you how long to brush each quadrant.  It&#x27;s expensive, including the brushes,  but I had the last toothbrush at least a year and a half before the battery ran out (hard to replace).  When you figure out how much it costs per week or month to use, it&#x27;s no more than many other items you buy.  I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is due to the small stand/charging station - the brush can easily fall over.  I have to place it in an area of the counter where I don&#x27;t have to move it to get to other things that may be sitting near it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Sonicare Product!  We prefer the more advanced brush heads but this model still provides a wonderful cleaning experience with several intensity settings.  Great Buy.</li>
    <li> Your teeth aren&#x27;t clean until they are Sonicare clean.  Used one for years.</li>
    <li> Now that I have this toothbrush there&#x27;s no way that I could ever live without it!</li>
    <li> I love it.  I have had a sonicare for over twenty years, and it was still working, but I decided to replace it with this new one.  I like the slender design, it is easy to keep clean, and it does a terrific job.</li>
    <li> Love the new design, do not like the multiple settings..I guess if I just had one for clean &amp; whiten.</li>
    <li> It came quicker than expected and works great!</li>
    <li> I have had Philips Sonicare electric toothbrushes for a number of years.  But, I&#x27;ve bought the more expplensive models. They have worked great, but tend to loose battery power and/or start to vibrate very weakly after a couple of years.  I decided a couple of weeks ago to replace my last one that totally died with this cheaper brand (the HX6731).  It is terrible.  It is loud and vibrates (I&#x27;m talking about the handle not the brush) and is just not comfortable to use.  Where is the quality control.  Sonicare has a great product with the more expensive models -- if only they&#x27;d last a little longer.  How about a modern lithium ion rechargeable battery.  Somebody could make a fortune with a &amp;#34;kickstart&amp;#34; company if they&#x27;d only make a quality product that last about 5 years.  I&#x27;d easily pay $300 for something like that.  Apparently, the lower price Sonicare electric toothbrushes are low quality made with a lot of short cuts.  Unfortunately, they are probably the best products on the market as far as electric tooth brushes are concerned.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.  I guess I&#x27;ll go through the hassle of trying to send it back although I value my time much more that the value of the product.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Although there are good reviews, I can tell you that I&#x27;ve had four Sonicare products -- this is the worst and they keep getting worse and worse until finally I&#x27;m going to give up and go to a manual tooth brush.  That is hard for me to say because I really liked the more expensive models such as the HX6910 (now dead) and the HX6930 (makes noise but will not vibrate).  Both worked great for several years.  Maybe it was the $150 plus cost, which I would pay again if I thought Philips quality control was sufficient or if I could replace the battery once it dies after warranty.</li>
    <li> Working great and it was a great deal</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t turn off at 2 minutes.  When set at whitening, it didn&#x27;t change to that mode.  It was difficult to tell which mode you were in when you were brushing your teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 8 years.  I had the older style, but decided to upgrade for the rechargeable batteries. (And I needed new brush heads; so I thought why not.)  The charger is pretty cool; no exposed metal!  It just sits on a peg in the base.  It&#x27;s thinner than the old one and has a couple different brush settings.  I found out I can press and hold the button to turn it off instead of cycling through the other settings.  That might be in the directions, but I didn&#x27;t read them; it&#x27;s not that complicated; it&#x27;s a toothbrush.  Sonicare toothbrushes clean well and this one is no different. It made my last trip to the dentist bearable; the hygienist didn&#x27;t have to scrape for too long even though it had been several years between appointments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase and will continue using Sonicare brushes as long as it keeps me out of the chair for any longer than necessary.</li>
    <li> I really like the Philips Sonicare toothbrush. It can not compare to any other item that I am aware of. It surpassed my expectations. It is a product I would recommend to family, friends and amazon reviewers.</li>
    <li> would give it 5 stars if it lasted longer. i am on my third one in 3 years. Second one was warrantied.</li>
    <li> after awhile the tip of the machine will loosen up and starty to make a big rumble sound  still trying to find out if I can fix it or send it back</li>
    <li> The brush is great-- my teeth have never felt cleaner. Only problem is I didn&#x27;t think (or look into) how expense the replacement heads are, and this brush does not come with any extra. They say that the heads need to be replaced at least every 3 months, and replacement heads cost about $30 for two. Just something to consider if you are like me and making the switch from manual to electric tootherbrush</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush ever!</li>
    <li> I love the quad pacer feature</li>
    <li> This product is very good, but expensive.</li>
    <li> Love this!  My teeth feel so clean!  I look forward to using it!</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Sonicare with this new one. Very efficient.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is great tool for healthy teeth.  Healthier teeth/gums are reaping benefits of advanced brushing system.  Recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush for my husband, he loves it and his teeth are definitely whiter.  Now I must buy one for myself!</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush. Holds a charge a long time so great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is my 3d of this product, a really good machine--holds up well and does a great job.  Quick delivery, too!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is pure magic.</li>
    <li> Best toothbrush around!</li>
    <li> I bought one for my wife initially and tried it and liked it so much I had to buy one for myself.  I used to think all toothbrushes were the same but the Sonicare will definitely prove this theory wrong.  It will give you the &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; feeling every time you brush.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Great price and Amazingly toothbrush</li>
    <li> I used an Oral-B pro-series for 11 years. It did last 11 years. I will say that for it. But, my main complaint is that the way it&#x27;s designed isn&#x27;t sanitary. There are too many crevices where saliva drips into and can&#x27;t be cleaned. It gets really disgusting. I had no idea that Sonicare would be so much better in that respect. You can dry it off, and that&#x27;s the end of it. It is a powerful little toothbrush. I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s a little bit to get used to. But, I love it. My decision to buy it came from research from a government website stating the results of testing Oral-B and Sonicare. They named Sonicare as the &amp;#34;superior&amp;#34; brush.</li>
    <li> Update dtd. August 2015. Amazing service.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my one in June last year, and it was good within a year and recently died. I used the on-line chat at Philips web site to figure out if I can expect a replacement, and they immediately recognized the product and sent a new handle to replenish right away as the product i bought at Amazon was covered by 2 years guarantee. I am totally happy with their service!</li>
    <li> Time will tell if it was a good deal.  It seems to be the travel version (comes with a travel case and compact charger base).  What is included is stated in the text though. They don&#x27;t call it the travel version but that is what it is.  I would have preferred a bigger base and way to mount it. Base is very small and easy it tip over.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love my sonicare toothbrush! I was given this as a birthday gift so I&#x27;ve been using this almost a year. This model is the basic model of sonicare. It doesn&#x27;t come with all the frills (i.e. gum care, different intensity levels, etc.) but I wouldn&#x27;t use those even if I had them. I brush my teeth with this toothbrush in the morning and then again in the evening. My mouth feels much cleaner then when I am forced to use a manual toothbrush (when I travel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally dropped the toothbrush when I first got it. I contacted the company and they shipped a new toothbrush to my door. They paid the postage for returning the old toothbrush. You have to love when a company stands behind their product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush has an automatic timer built into it. The power pauses for a split second after each 30 seconds. This is a reminder to switch to the next &amp;#34;quadrant&amp;#34; for brushing (based on a 2 minute brushing). I don&#x27;t always follow it, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt to have it as a reminder. The bristles of the brush fade gradually with use. When completely faded, that indicates that a new brush is needed. I find that the bristles are still stiff enough and straight for another month or more following that. The bad part about an electric toothbrush is the brush heads are so expensive. I feel like they sell the brush at a loss, so they can gouge customers on the brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I really like the toothbrush. My mouth feels really clean after using it. I would buy again. I don&#x27;t think the high end brushes are worth the additional cost. My dentist told me that I&#x27;m perfect. I told my wife that and she wasn&#x27;t amused :) I hope my review has aiding you in making an informed decision!</li>
    <li> I had my first Phillips Sonic for 5 years and absolutely loved it. I can&#x27;t remember the model, but was around $100. I bought this one just under 2 years ago and like it for more than a year. All of a sudden, it would stop vibrating if I put any pressure on teeth. If you hold it just right and don&#x27;t apply any pressure, it works, but makes brushing teeth frustrating. I am looking to replace it and not sure I want to go back with the Phillips.  I don&#x27;t mind spending the money on something that is reliable and works for at least a few years.</li>
    <li> I had one before but it died. I had to get another. It really cleans very good and very deep and you notice the results.</li>
    <li> This is the second Philips Sonicare I purchased.  The on/off &amp;#34;button&amp;#34; broke on the first one after about 3-4 years of use (3 times a day).  My teeth and month feel clean after brushing.  I also like to brush my tongue and upper pallet.  A slight inconvenience is that I have to press the mode selector button 3 times to turn it off.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. I have been using the Sonicare for several years. My old one died after 10 years. I bought this one because I have a tendency to brush too hard (well, that is what my dentist says). This works great. You can put it on the whitening mode (which is the more aggressive mode) and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to really scrub my teeth. My dentist likes it too - I guess I don&#x27;t brush too hard with it.</li>
    <li> Sonicare used to make a toothbrush that would last.  I am on my 3rd in the past 3 years.  The first died after a year and a half, the second died in 9 months and Philips replaced it under warranty.  This one has lasted just over a year, but Philips will only warranty the toothbrush from the date the original was bought.  They won&#x27;t even warranty the replacement.  Absolutely love the toothbrush, but won&#x27;t ever spend the money for a sonicare again until they can make a product that lasts and they will stand behind.</li>
    <li> I have used the Sonicare for more than 10 years now, and this is my third one. Previously I had the essence series, and I hated how they always got wet and moldy inside the brush head. It seems that with this design the problem is eliminated. I do hope that the battery will last longer than in my other two. Apart from that, the Sonicare cleaning system is great, the results are noticeable. My dentist always comments on when I have used it for a longer time, and always notices that my gums are different when I stop using my Sonicare (after the battery died on my last one I was contemplating not to replace it).&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell yet if this model will indeed make my teeth whiter, but I do love the clean feeling after brushing with it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine going a day without my Sonicare toothbrush. It keeps my teeth super clean between dentist visits and the sonic action is great for the gums. My dentist always thinks I floss because my gums are so healthy.</li>
    <li> It is a good product and cleansss and cares for your teeth.  I highly recommend it for any one to use.</li>
    <li> one of the best personal care investment i ever made</li>
    <li> The price is very reasonable and the functions are enough for daily use.</li>
    <li> This is a must-have item! Cleans your teeth good!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it. It&#x27;s her second one, after we lost one in a move.</li>
    <li> An excellent product I have given one to my daughter and her children too. Really helps clean the teeth, prevents the build up of plaque and saves you money on your dental bills.</li>
    <li> Sonicare toothbrushes are awesome.  I know it seems odd to wax eloquently about such a simple thing as a toothbrush, but if you&#x27;ve never been fortunate enough to have used one of these before, you are in for a treat.  Sure, it&#x27;s also the height of laziness to have one of the automatic three mode, quick to recharge gadgets.  But it is also high on the smart list.  These things live up to most of the hype.</li>
    <li> This is my second Sonicare. These products are incredibly well made and worth every bit of $100</li>
    <li> I regret selecting this Sonicare model as a replacement for a five-year-old FlexCare that finally died.  The HealthyWhite is very poorly designed.  The FlexCare models, even the old ones, have two buttons, one is on/off, one selects which mode it is in.  The HealthyWhite model only has one button that performs both functions.  So the toothbrush has to be turned on -- meaning vibrating at a high rate of speed -- to change the mode.  The default is &amp;#34;Clean.&amp;#34;  But of course, if you&#x27;re buying this toothbrush, you probably want to use the &amp;#34;Clean and White&amp;#34; function.  You have to hit the power button twice more to toggle it over to &amp;#34;Clean and White,&amp;#34; while the violent vibrations fling your toothpaste into the sink.  You might think you can do that while the toothbrush is in your mouth, but then you can&#x27;t see the indicator light that tells you what mode you&#x27;re in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also much louder than my old FlexCare was and once I&#x27;ve got it into &amp;#34;Clean and White&amp;#34; mode, I don&#x27;t like the whitening function.  It&#x27;s got a different vibration and it makes my mouth feel funny.  Also, to be clear, to use the &amp;#34;Clean and White&amp;#34; function, you&#x27;re going to have to brush your teeth for three minutes, not two.  I bet you could just use the extra long cleaning cycle on the FlexCare and get the same results.  (My guess is the weird harder vibration is mostly to make you feel like it&#x27;s doing something different/extra, but it actually works by forcing you to brush longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d known I was going to end up using this only in &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; mode, I would&#x27;ve bought the most basic one at half the price.  Alternatively, I could have sprung for a more expensive one where I could change modes easily.  But this is the worst of both worlds -- higher price, but the extras aren&#x27;t functional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add, by the way, that if you&#x27;re on the fence about whether to buy a Sonicare at all, I&#x27;m a big fan of the brand.  When I travel without it,I really notice the difference.  I just don&#x27;t like this particular model.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for myself since it was recommended by my dentist.  I am very happy with the it!</li>
    <li> Have always been hesitant to try an electric toothbrush. After in depth conversations with friends, family and a couple of dentist friends the Sonicare line of electric toothbrushes are the some of the best out there. Comes with a convenient travel case for those who travel and the charge lasts about a week and a half of 2x per day usage. All in all, I&#x27;m a converted electric toothbrush user now,</li>
    <li> While I loved this toothbrush while it worked, less than a year after purchase, the battery has completely malfunctioned and won&#x27;t charge anymore. I am very dissatisfied with Philips; silly me thought that a $100 toothbrush would have lasted longer than this. :( I&#x27;m also very sad that I won&#x27;t be getting that nice dentist clean feeling daily. I really hope that Amazon or Phillips will stand behind their products and replace this ASAP. I hope you have better luck with this product.    **Update 10/12/14**     Thanks to Amazon&#x27;s great customer service, I am changing my previous rating of 2, to a 4. I&#x27;m still disappointed with the manufacturer, but Amazon has offered a replacement or refund of this purchase. I am excited to receive the new toothbrush; I just hope this one lasts longer than the last one.</li>
    <li> I bought two for my family. They love them. Nothing can complain.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in the future.</li>
    <li> I love Sonicare&#x27;s electric toothbrushes.  My last one lasted beautifully for over 10 years, so I purchased this new one (because the on button was worn out on the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Sonicare, I don&#x27;t need to use bleach or other whitening products.  My teeth always look and feel clean and healthy.  It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re a cheap replacement but fall off easily.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush works well and I am pleased to get it.</li>
    <li> I purchased the earlier version, HX6711/02, on April 16, 2012. This week the metal part that holds the brush to the handle fell off. Disappointing! The previous Sonicare tooth brush I used for over 10 years. Current versions do not appear to be built with the same quality. The multiple settings was a pain, as you have to push the button through these cycles - personally I could not tell much difference, so this feature was a waste and hassle for me. The replacement brushes are a bit overpriced.    Here&#x27;s the good news. I went to Philips webpage to see if I could purchase a replacment of the handle without having to pay for a new charger. I contacted support via chat and after providing info and answering a series of questions, Philips representative agreed to replace the handle and send a shipping label to return the broken part. I modified my rating since the company stood behind the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for three days so far but it is the best electric tooth brush I have ever used. The different settings are very convenient and the brush automatically shuts off after two minutes of brushing.</li>
    <li> For the past 3 years, my teeth had ugly red wine stains. Many people mistook those stains for smoking, which I don&#x27;t. Despite brushing my teeth religiously with normal toothbrush, the stains remained. I did not want to go for teeth whitening as I have weak teeth, and those horror reviews from teeth whitening products or procedures scares me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 months after using this brush, there is hardly any stains left in my teeth. It feels much cleaner and healthier too! My only complain is that the brush head needs to be replaced after every 3 months or so, and the replacement heads are comparatively expensive.</li>
    <li> Works very well and really cleans teeth nicely, recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am happy with this purchase.  A little pricey though.</li>
    <li> Requested gift for my son.  He loves it! Recommended by our dentist.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this  Phillips Sonicare for others.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a toothbrush that works as efficient and cleans as well as this one does. Highly recommended! :D</li>
    <li> We have used nothing but our Philips toothbrushes, since we first purchased one from our dentist. We have used different models, but have found that the healthywhite  suits our needs very well. A regular toothbrush just does not give you the fresh, clean mouth that an electric toothbrush does. We have had one other electric brand which was good, but we prefer this brand.</li>
    <li> Wish it had an on and off button with separate button for settings. Downside, brush are not cheap, but they do last.</li>
    <li> Traded up from a high-end Oral-b model that I used for 2 years. This brush the Sonicare is much more effective. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Only problem is that you can&#x27;t just turn it on and off. You have to hit the button 3 times to get to desired level before switching off</li>
    <li> Overall, the Philips Sonicare has impressed this first time user of electric toothbrushes, however some of the concerns that others have mentioned in reviews has happened to me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Three week battery charge&lt;br /&gt;30 second timer letting you know when to change the next section&lt;br /&gt;Much better clean than an average toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;The sensitive setting has helped my gums not bleed every time I brushed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste is going to get on the device, and all gunked up under the head&lt;br /&gt;You need to have a strong arm to handle the vibrations (just as an fyi)&lt;br /&gt;The replacement heads are EXPENSIVE -- Make sure you look before purchasings</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush!  I use it on the whitening setting and it thoroughly cleans my teeth.  I would highly recommend this model.</li>
    <li> Definatly i am not coming back to a regular brush, the best investment that i made it so far!!!</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Used the competition for years, but I like this one much better.  Teeth feel cleaner.  I also prefer the larger toothbrush style head over the little round one.</li>
    <li> Love this brush my mouth feels fresh from the dentist clean.  I love the clean/whiten function, and have noticed a difference in the brightness of my smile after a few weeks of using it.</li>
    <li> Very good product, cleans much moré that antes other and the timer help a lot in the cleaning 2 min</li>
    <li> Its a Phillips.  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, but you&#x27;re buying the name.</li>
    <li> I have been using this toothbrush for about 2 weeks and while I can&#x27;t see a noticeable change in the whiteness of my teeth, they have felt extremely clean over the past couple weeks. Prior to using this toothbrush, I was using an Oral-B spin brush. I used to be a long time user of a sonicare toothbrush prior to the oral-b, but was noticing problems with receding gum lines. I don&#x27;t know if that was due to the deep cleaning of the sonicare, so I am definitely going to keep my eye on that this time around. The features on this brush are nice, but you have to read the manual to understand how they work. For example, for the clean and white mode, it says \\&quot;When you use the Clean and White mode, you hear and feel a change in the brush head sound and motion after 2 minutes of Clean mode. Then move the brush head to the visible top front teeth and brush them for 15 seconds. At the final beep and pause, move to the visible bottom teeth and brush them for 15 seconds.\\&quot; Also, the sensitive setting is great if there are kids in the house. I have found that brushing kids teeth with an electric toothbrush is much more effective. Especially when they are squirmy.</li>
    <li> I have used electric toothbrushes for years, and I think they have all been relatively good products.  However, some are tough on the gums and I think have brushes that are much stiffer than they need to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush on this model is extremely soft, and yet, the way it works cleans with ease.  It even gets things out from between teeth.  It is not as good as flossing, but if you can&#x27;t floss or don&#x27;t, this does the trick better than any brush I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primary advantage of all of these brushes is ease of use.  It is easy to use because you can just angle it this way and that and get it to go everywhere in your mouth without much effort.  This includes the places most people miss with regular toothbrushes because of the difficulty, like behind the teeth and around the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is the best of the bunch I have used.  It does take a bit of getting used to, because it vibrates very quickly, and at first, I found it continually hitting against the teeth opposite those I was brushing. The back of the brush bumping into a tooth is a bit unpleasant, so you learn to avoid it after the first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth are worth the best toothbrush out there, and it is my belief this one is it.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic brush: extremely good quality; durable; does not get dirty easily but is easy to clean. The actual brush is powerful yet the bristles are soft and gentle; the cleaning modes are nice and allow you to customize your brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the charge lasts a long time and the product is overall very low-maintenance. Definitely a great investment.</li>
    <li> Used Oral B for 8 years. ON off switch died. Finally had to buy new one. On/off switch DOA. Sonicare does a significantly better job of cleaning than the Oral B. Have no clue why they have so many different (?) models.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush at the recommendation of a friend and I&#x27;m glad I did! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and my teeth feel much cleaner than they have ever before. I really like the built in timer so I know I&#x27;m brushing all sections of my teeth evenly. I know now that I was definitely not brushing my teeth long enough before I switched to the Sonicare. It might be in my head, but I feel like my teeth look whiter after just a week of using it! Also really like the convenient travel case that it comes with. Battery life is solid - I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and haven&#x27;t had to charge it yet. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd unit. They work well but they don&#x27;t seem to last much beyond the warranty date.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! It&#x27;s lightweight and the toothbrush head is the perfect size for me! My teeth feel so clean! Also the 3 settings are perfect! I like this one so much I bought the Diamond Clean toothbrush heads for it also! And the extended warranty when I registered it is super! This is my second Phillips Sonicare toothbrush and I highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about their dental hygiene!</li>
    <li> I like Sonicare products but this version has an annoying power button.  It cycles through 4 options (3 on modes and 1 off mode).  It always starts in the normal brush mode and if you want to turn it off from there you&#x27;ll need to either hit the button 3 times or press and hold it for a few seconds.  I don&#x27;t understand why the press and hold wasn&#x27;t used to change the default brush mode and then a simple press on/off used to turn it on/off in that default mode.  This is how the older versions worked.  For me, I much prefer the 2-buttons on the FlexCare versions since in that case one of them is a true on/off button.  Though in that version you need to get used to holding the thing in such a way that you don&#x27;t press the mode button while brushing.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for someone else.</li>
    <li> Use this brush twice a day and your dental hygienist will notice the results!</li>
    <li> Works great. It is the only brand of toothbrush I use</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> works as well as my old one.  No surprises what so ever.  arrived on time and in one piece.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric toothbrush with round spinning head and pulsating brush for years and this electric toothbrush is the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Three brushing mode for daily use, whitening, and a softer one&lt;br /&gt;+ 2-min timer and quadrant reminders help brush all parts evenly&lt;br /&gt;+ Perfect grip, contoured brush head feels natural like regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;+ Reasonable charging time and good battery life&lt;br /&gt;+ Small charger/base means smaller footprint on the countertop&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All great. No negative point so far. Absolutely happy with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Amazing toothbrush!!  This is my 3rd Sonicare and favorite so far.  My teeth have never felt cleaner!  I get my teeth cleaner with this better then I get them cleaned at the dentist. It even has a lil sparkle to it, which I didn&#x27;t know until I got it in the mail and I was soo happy:)!</li>
    <li> Great really makes my mouth feel clean!</li>
    <li> Expensive but pays for itself by replacing professional teeth cleaning (used to go in twice a year, now will go once).  I use it once a day with baking soda.  I keep it on the recharger.  Still use a regular brush with a fluoride toothpaste after meals.</li>
    <li> my wife&#x27;s teeth are pearly white</li>
    <li> I love it. Makes my teeth shine</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. My Wife uses this same toothbrush and loves it.</li>
    <li> I had been using a Spinbrush for at least two years but became curious about sonic ones recently. I relied on Amazon comparisons and reviews and decided on this mid-range Healthywhite model -- the DiamondClean seems powerful and is aesthetically gorgeous but I had zero need for that many features and that high a price. I liked that this Healthywhite has three basic modes and a low-profile charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it during a great sale with some coupons and gave it a shot. Hated it. Didn&#x27;t clean the plaque well enough, brush head felt way too small, the buzzing was awkward. I seriously considered returning it. The awesome price and everyone else&#x27;s positive reviews convinced me to hang on, though, and I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a two-week &amp;#34;ramp-up&amp;#34; period where the brush gradually becomes more powerful as you get used to the sensation. And suddenly one day, the surfaces of my teeth felt smooth as silk, and the gumlines were flawless. I&#x27;m totally ready for the praise from my dentist. That clean feeling also motivates me to floss more often in order to to maintain it. There&#x27;s also no gunk build-up on the handle, it has a slim profile, and I like that I can try the more expensive brush heads on this base. I love the quadpacer feature as well -- keeps me brushing for two minutes. I haven&#x27;t been able to really tell if my teeth are whiter, but I don&#x27;t smoke or anything ... my teeth are already white. The plaque cleaning is what matters to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints: You have to cycle through the modes every time -- the brush doesn&#x27;t keep the last one you used. And the power button is the same as the mode button, so you can&#x27;t choose a cycle before adding the toothpaste unless you want everything to go flying. Yes, there are only three modes, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to memorize the order of them or try to stare in the mirror while the brush is in my mouth. Battery isn&#x27;t replaceable, but I suppose that&#x27;s the trade-off for the slim profile.  Ialso wish it had come with an extra brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Background on my teeth: I&#x27;m in my late 20s, have been a deficient flosser since childhood [Dentist: &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t you want to have perfect teeth like your big sisters?&amp;#34; Me: &amp;#34;Nope.&amp;#34;] and not diligent about brushing twice a day; occasional gum sensitivity because of lack of flossing; braces as a teen, Invisalign as an adult; normal checkups otherwise)</li>
    <li> all I can say is GREAT............you should buy this...........</li>
    <li> Works great, now if only I would stop drinking soda my dentist would be happy.</li>
    <li> If you hate the dentist, buy one.  If you brush too hard with a regular brush and cause your gums to recede, buy one.  If you have stains on your teeth, buy one.  If you do none of these things, still, buy one.</li>
    <li> Im now a big fan, ive always used normal toothbrushes but after this one im hooked on sonicare</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my wife when hers finally died (previous version). It is exactly the same with the updated whatever, and that&#x27;s what I wanted. Best yet, the price hasn&#x27;t increased since we purchased the original (which came with two). When mine finally dies, I&#x27;ll purchase another.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel clean again and my dentist will be happy. This is the third Sonicare I&#x27;ve bought and I think each one is better than the last.</li>
    <li> I have no complaints. Stays charged for over a week unplugged.  Great price. So I am buying them as gifts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a toothbrush....It works....What else can I say.......If I didn&#x27;t like it, you would have it back. I hate these surveys.......</li>
    <li> I finally gave in to buy this and am so glad.  So much different than the battery ones in the drug stores.  My teeth feel so clean.  My next dentist appt. will be the one where I find out if it really does make a diff.  But I&#x27;m sure it has.</li>
    <li> The seller performed perfectly.  The item arrived intact, in a reasonable sized, easy to open box and was exactly as advertised.  It arrived two days ahead of the original scheduled date.</li>
    <li> A little tickly on the lips first but then you get used to it. Cleans well.</li>
    <li> died after a few months but did clean well while working</li>
    <li> Recipient says is works well. Dentist suggested the recipient try this particular brand so we will see if they are right.</li>
    <li> I think the 45$ one would suffice just fine. And after spendin 100$ they shorted the replacement brushes in packaging. You could see at one time they sent them with 3 from indentation in plastic.  Kinda disappointed all in all.</li>
    <li> This is our second philips sonicare toothbrush. We love this brand. Please note this specific tootbrush only comes with one toothbrush head holder. We needed 2 spots.</li>
    <li> After my Braun Oral-B electric brush finally died, I decided to try a different brand, recommended by my dental hygienist. After one use, my mouth felt as if I had just had a cleaning at the dentist. It has some great features, such as the whitening mode, and the pauses every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next section of your mouth.</li>
    <li> I started using this toothbrush after my dentist gave me a wake up call that my teeth and gums were in pretty bad shape ( i rarely brushed or floss before I went to bed.. I also put off my annual teeth cleaning for 2 years.. so yeah pretty bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have been using the Sonicare Healthywhite, for almost 2 weeks now, my teeth seem whiter, my gums look healthier and I smile so much more now than I used to. I know this toothbrush and the brush heads can be expensive but Amazon does have a good deal on the price and it is WORTH the investment. In the long run it is much cheaper than having to treat gum disease or get veneers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you must try to brush and floss and use mouth wash twice a day!! This is so necessary! I am extremely satisfied with this toothbrush and I now look forward to going to the dentist and showing off how healthy my teeth and gums now are.</li>
    <li> Waiting for a final rating until I get my first cleaning done to see if this helped with my plaque issue. So far so good.  It seems to be doing a good job.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my family. they love them!</li>
    <li> this bad boy works really well. much stronger cleaning than from oral b products, and the battery has lasted strong for 2 years now. the brush heads are expensive, but i&#x27;ve had decent luck with generics (they don&#x27;t last quite as long, but they&#x27;re a fraction of the price).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my main qualm is that the handle starts to develop a really putrid smell. i wash the toothbrush after every use, but water and residue inevitably drip down and collect in the rubber and plastic grooves at the bottom of the housing of the handle. i&#x27;ve tried soaking in mouthwash and even bleach (a testament to how waterproof this thing is), which works for a brief period of time (a couple of days), but then back comes the odor!</li>
    <li> Very good toothbrush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so much better than the previous Sonicare I had. Even though I thought at first that the motor wasn&#x27;t as strong as I had expected, the brushes were moving faster than the old brush and was removing plaque really well.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference this brush makes! Your feel super clean, and wow, do your teeth get white.</li>
    <li> Works well. Teeth are noticeably cleaner after use. The areas where I usually form plaque look great.</li>
    <li> The body of the brush got mold quite soon, and cannot get the mold and stain off.</li>
    <li> fantastic. kept the tartar away like nothing else. used in conjunction with Philips Sonicare HX8211/02 Airfloss Rechargeable Electric Flosser and the two literally worked miracles with my tartar-prone teeth.</li>
    <li> I really love what a great job this did cleaning my teeth, but the stem of the brush head snapped off when I was removing it. I only it for about 8 months.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice addition to ones oral hygiene.  it works far better than manual brushing.  I just got braces at 47 years old.  This thing works great with those as well.  Yea me for spending the money on what I first thought was a frivolous purchase. Replacement brushes are a bit pricey but how can you put a price on keeping your original teeth?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I ever lived without this in my life!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Works just like I hoped. For electric toothbrushes, you can&#x27;t beat the price and performance.</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife for Christmas (she ask for one) she said it takes some getting used to but she loves it.</li>
    <li> This is my second sonicare electronic toothbrush. It really gives a deep cleaning that manual toothbrushes just can&#x27;t provide. I like that it has the two-minute auto shut off so you don&#x27;t brush your teeth for too short a period of time.</li>
    <li> Better tooth brush than previous e series. Small connection to base making this so much cleaner! Big Improvement!</li>
    <li> I had a very old Sonicare that eventually wore out.  This one is so quiet!  It holds the charge a long time which is great for traveling.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second one... I highly recommend it.  I love it</li>
    <li> The Philips Sonicare is excellent and gives a good clean brush.  Battery life is much better than on my old rotary brush electric.  The only minor drawback is the rather high pitched (but low volume) noise.  It is much quieter than the old rotary brush, but the high pitch can be a little annoying.</li>
    <li> Really outstanding product so far. Works wonders for teeth and one of the few products I&#x27;ve used that actually does what it says and whitens teeth noticeably in 2 weeks. You&#x27;ll never go back to a normal toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Great electric toothbrush but not durable. Mine broke down after only one year of use. (All Sonicare tooth brushes are now made in China.) Update--I am upgrading from 2 to 4 stars because of the outstanding customer service i received. There is a 2-year warranty on this toothbrush and after providing the model and serial number over the phone they determined it was still in the warranty period. After talking me through a few steps to see if the problem could be fixed over the phone (it could not), they took my address and are sending me a new tooth brush via FedEx. Sonicare Customer Service 800-682-7664</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Sonicare.  My old one, which I bought about 7 years ago, finally died.  For the few days that I was without it, using a manual toothbrush, I noticed a huge difference in both the texture and color of my teeth.  They never felt clean, and actually got noticeably yellow around the edges.  I was very glad to get this one and get my ultra clean teeth back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only beef with this particular model (I think I had a deluxe model previously) is that it doesn&#x27;t auto start on the setting you prefer.  You have to cycle through the settings to get the one you want, and also have to cycle through to turn it off (unless you just let it turn off at the end of its programmed cycle).</li>
    <li> Use it every day and it works great. Would recommend it to anyone who needs a thorough teeth and gum cleaning.</li>
    <li> I used a sonicare for more than 10 years before. It finally died on me this past month, probably because I forgot and placed the charger on a 220v outlet when traveling abroad where it is not supposed to. This one is lighter and skinner than my old model. The weight reduction is likely due to the different type of batteries used (this one using lithium ion). Also, the charger will work both on 110v and 220v outlets. The force of brushing also is stronger. The new brush tip configuration makes it very easy to rinse and clean after each use. The charging base is nice and small, so it doesn&#x27;t take much counter space at all. The brush tip also has an indicator strip reminding you to change the tip at the recommended time frames of 3 months. I just brought it on a trip, and the battery lasted 8 rounds so far of the Clean and White mode with no discernable decrease in power. My old one would have died much sooner.</li>
    <li> Took a few days to adjust to the vibration, it tickled.  Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This is the second Philips Sonicare that I have owned. The first one lasted over six years. I love this product.&lt;br /&gt; The product was delivered on time and intact and is working great.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this newer model. I have been using a sonic care of about 5 years now but this model is by far the best. My cleanings are now a breeze with my dentist. I only get cleanings once a year because using sonic care has really helped me keep my teeth and gums healthy. I highly recommend this to anyone who does not like to be at a dentist office!</li>
    <li> PHILIPS SONICARE HEALTHYWHITE rechargeable sonic toothbrush. This is the number one brand recommended by dental professionals.  I recently bought this item to replace an older model by the same firm: I’m the child of depression survivors and tend to use things until they die.  I find this newer model an improvement on the older in many ways.  The brush head has been redesigned; its contours are more ergonomic, more comfortable and with better reach. The handle is also slimmer, and easier to get my small hand around.  It does seem to get my teeth cleaner, removing many stains, red wine, etc., faster than the earlier model did; the manufacturer states this new patented sonic technology delivers 31,000 brush strokes per minute. It offers a quadpacer &amp; smartimer mode, each encouraging attentive brushing and reinforcing a recommended brushing time of at least two minutes. It has a recharge indicator that blinks to remind you when to recharge, and charges faster than the older model. Also, they have combined the older model’s charger and holder; plus the new charger’s footprint is smaller, so it takes up noticeably less of the valuable space on my crowded bathroom counter.  It comes with a bonus diamond clean head, a little toothbrush plastic cap for travel, a hard travel kit and a two-year warranty.</li>
    <li> My older version had two buttons, one for on/off, and one for choice of brushing (sensitive, massage, etc.)  This one only has one button to choose which brushing style you want to use, so you better have it in your mouth when you choose, otherwise you&#x27;ll have toothpaste flying all over your face and mirror.</li>
    <li> Lightweight, very portable, easy to clean, charge lasts almost 3 weeks with twice daily use. Highly recommended for travel and comes with travel case for easy storage and protection of brush and head. Charger works with world voltages.</li>
    <li> Big fan. These will change your life!</li>
    <li> An excellent product.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush works great.  I am sorry that one of the 3 settings isn&#x27;t shorter than 2 minutes like my old Sonicare.  I wish the description had been clearer regarding the settings.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is that I don&#x27;t think you really need to spend the extra money for a &amp;#34;Healthy White&amp;#34; model.  It is just brushing a little longer on a different vibration of the brush.  Brushing twice a day with the regular model would do the same in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This is the sinecure you want to buy</li>
    <li> bye bye old manual brush.  This Sonicare brush is worth the money, and yes I did notice my teeth getting whiter, and I drink a jug of coffee everyday, money well spent.</li>
    <li> As a dentist, I have tried and used many other electric toothbrushes. I recommended this one to my husband also because he was using an Oral B toothbrush before and the sonicare is the one I recommend. It&#x27;s all a matter of personal preference but I like the 3 settings on the toothbrush and ease of use. The compact head (diamondclean) is compatible with this toothbrush unit.</li>
    <li> It was a great new experience using this brush!&lt;br /&gt;Usually electric toothbrushes seem to vibrate much more violently and are not gentle at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush is like a gentle hum but it gets teeth much cleaner! And I like how it tells me when to brush where.</li>
    <li> Makes my teeth feel very clean, but not any whiter. This is my first electric toothbrush and first time I used it, I stayed in one quadrant for too long because the &#x27;beep&#x27; isn&#x27;t actually a beep, but a slight change in the vibration of the brush. So now one tooth from that quadrant is really sensitive and I have been babying it for awhile. Overall a very good brush with a long lasting battery and a good choice of settings.</li>
    <li> Longer battery life and additional brush speed choice for regular or whitening while still providing a gentle clean.  Happy with the new design that eliminated the bacteria catch basin from the old model.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare was so disgusting as it would grow inside the brush head some seriously wretched funk! This new unit is way smaller on the brush head and doesn&#x27;t allow water up under the brush. Way less disgusting and much easier to move around in my mouth. Nice upgrade.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and found that the sonic feature of this toothbrush (similar to the one your dentist might use) made my teeth hurt. I don&#x27;t really like it at the dentist, either, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Purchased an Oral B instead, which I have used for many years with no problems.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! My teeth feel clean everyday day and night. .!!</li>
    <li> Doe s a great. Job and recommend by dentist</li>
    <li> Perfect in all ways&lt;br /&gt;A+++++</li>
    <li> Ok...I love this toothbrush. And my kids keep stealing it from me so I have to buy some extra heads for them.</li>
    <li> Really gets your teeth clean.  Much better than the old rotary one I used to have. Keeps a charge a long time even if you don&#x27;t place it on the re-charger.  Heads are easy to clean and change.</li>
    <li> A good toothbrush, but we&#x27;ve had two and the batteries die after 16 months.  So this is an expensive disposable toothbrush.  Older sonicare designs had batteries that lasted for several years.</li>
    <li> I used to be really apprehensive about the higher-cost tooth brushes such as the Philips Sonicare HX6731 but after trying it out I must say I don&#x27;t think my teeth have ever been cleaned so well, with the exception of the dentist and orthodontists. I highly recommend this brush to anyone who is really trying to ensure their teeth and gums are properly taken care of.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush a year and a half ago and just had to buy another one because the top came loose and would not vibrate the brush.  I would have purchased another brand, but I still had replacement brushes for this model.  My old sonicare (the thicker model) lasted 7 years. It is ashame that these new ones are not designed with the same quality.</li>
    <li> A totally unique experience compared to my old Oral-B. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> Product works as promised. It came with a travel case and charger.&lt;br /&gt;Read the product description and &amp;#34;answered questions&amp;#34; before purchase to see if your choice comes with a case; I didn&#x27;t notice that detail, and ordered a separate travel case, which, after UPS charges, was not worth the refund to return. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> A great toothbrush.  My dental hygienist said I should change my Oral B brush for Sonicare.  She said it was safer for enamel and the gums.  My teeth feel super polished now, like coming from the dentist.</li>
    <li> scaled down in size looks good on bath counter if you need to leave it out and does a fine job of hygiene for&lt;br /&gt;your teeth.</li>
    <li> I just got my brush yesterday and I love it already. I keep getting &amp;#34;yelled&amp;#34; at by the dentist because I brush too hard and my gums are suffering. I tried to brush lighter, but I keep going back to old habits. With the Sonicare...it is a breeze and my mouth feels 10x cleaner than when I used a traditional brush. The 30 sec timer is awesome and with the additional 15 sec timers for the front teeth...it&#x27;s just perfect. My only regret is not getting it sooner.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Philips Sonicare with this model as it was time after 5 years or so of use. The new head style is nice and compact while the brush design hits all the corners of the teeth easily. Battery life is awesome but it is brand new so only time will really tell if this is an improvement from the older series. Love it so far and hoping it lasts as long as the last one.</li>
    <li> My essence sonicare toothbrush finally bit the dust, so I decided to upgrade to the healthywhite, and I am glad I did.  It has three settings to choose from- clean, sensitive, and clean and white.  All the settings have a 30 second interval to alert you where you are at while brushing.  The clean and white has an extra 60 seconds at the end to whiten your teeth.  You can tell you are in that cycle because it sounds and cleans differently.  Just hover over the areas you need to whiten more in that cycle.  I am currently using the intercare brush head, which I believe works very well.  I also bought the diamond clean brush head, but have not tried it yet. Both brushes have different sized bristles to get in between the teeth and clean better.  The toothbrush base is very small.  The brush head easily pulls off so you can wipe off the base of the brush and the top of the toothbrush- which I really like.  The essence toothbrush I  used prior to this one had a screw-off brush head.  It always collected residue due to the way it was built- which really grossed me out.  Overall, I am very happy with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. I decided to purchase this brush after my parents so highly recommended an electronic toothbrush (philips sonicare brand to be exact). I was pretty into my oral health before, brushing after meals and flossing, but I noticed with a normal toothbrush my teeth still looked yellow or stained. I&#x27;m almost at 2-weeks here of using this brush and the results are incredible! My teeth have gotten at least 3 shades whiter using this brush! The yellow stains between my teeth and at my gum line are completely gone! Not to mention the feeling after you brush is like just coming back from the dentist! I never realized how poorly a regular toothbrush cleaned my teeth! I have gotten 3 compliments in the past week on how white my teeth look! Even from a cashier at a store! I couldn&#x27;t be happier, I truly believe this was the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought myself. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Finally some real improvements on the Sonicare brushes.  The early models had nooks and crannies where mildew could grow unless you were very dutiful in cleaning the device. This is much simpler, without places where crud can collect. (Well, it can collect, but it just wipes off -- no digging out of recessed places). The charger, too is more elegant and much, much smaller. So fare I like it.</li>
    <li> My first Sonicare lasted over 7 years. I replaced it with a Healthywhite in July 2012.  The battery died today.    My dental checkups have been so great with Sonicare that I&#x27;m unwilling to risk a brand switch. Ordered another today...and will research other brands...just in case. Expensive enough that I expect a product life of at 4-5 years.    Loved this toothbrush while it worked...so I&#x27;m giving it this model a Second Chance.    *** I saw the travel case for this under Frequently Bought Together...and bought one. And of course there&#x27;s a travel case in the box with the toothbrush and the charger.</li>
    <li> This one works great, but I think I like the older one better, only because I don&#x27;t need extra settings</li>
    <li> Could be a bit more powerful. Takes a couple of pushes of the button to switch it off</li>
    <li> Huge upgrade over my old one, pulsates at super high speeds and cleans my teeth very well.</li>
    <li> I used some old-school rotating brushes from Oral-B (years ago) but never really enjoyed the experience enough to use that brush regularly. I&#x27;ve instead used a standard brush for years. And standard brushes have plenty of drawbacks, which is why you&#x27;re browsing through these reviews, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t the Cadillac of Sonicare, I did plenty of research -- just like you&#x27;re doing! -- and concluded that this was the best value. I looked at the top of the line DiamondClean with the charging glass and I&#x27;m glad I passed on that. (1) to save a LOT of money, and (2) the charging glass, while cool, kind of grossed me out because of the bacteria breeding ground if you didn&#x27;t wash the glass every night. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-My teeth are whiter. It&#x27;s subjective, yes, but people have commented on it. And it&#x27;s not like I had gross teeth; they&#x27;re quite nice actually. But they&#x27;re subtly whiter ;)&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s a nice user experience. I used to hate brushing but now I look forward to it&lt;br /&gt;-It buzzes every 30 seconds so you know when to switch from top-front, top-inside, bottom-front, bottom-inside&lt;br /&gt;-The battery lasts 3 weeks as advertised. No need to keep the brush in its charger. I throw my charger in a drawer and pull it out once every 3 weeks, charge it overnight and throw it back in the drawer. That cleans up counter space and looks more elegant in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-The price of brushes is pretty high but I think the pros outweigh this.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing toothbrush! Better than my previous sonic brush that finally kicked the bucket. Couldn&#x27;t go back to a regular brush and after much research this was the best features for the money.</li>
    <li> Does what it needs to do.  Like the features.  Charger could have a more stable/broader base -- older models had bases that didn&#x27;t tip as easily.</li>
    <li> This is my 3d of this great product--long lasting machine, it does a wonderful job.  Superfast shipping, too!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> It is a little on the pricey side but it was recommended by my dentist and you can feel and see the difference immediately after using it.</li>
    <li> Sonicare is great but don&#x27;t fall for the &amp;#34;healthywhite&amp;#34; upsell!  It&#x27;s literally just a longer timer setting, nothing else.</li>
    <li> Did a little online research on different types before purchasing. Bought this and teamed it up with the diamond heads. Awesome combo and the price is good too!! Love that it has different settings.</li>
    <li> i have been using the previous generation for years.  this one is much better.  it does not leak water into the brush cavity.  it is quieter.  it is lighter/thinner.  and the charging stand is small (i travel and like small).</li>
    <li> The best toothbrush.  Just went to the Dentist and the Dentist was&lt;br /&gt;very impressed as how much my gums had improved since my last&lt;br /&gt;visit.  I attribute it all to the Sonicare Toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I travel frequently and this is the perfect companion for keeping teeth clean and having a fresh mouth. Recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Been wanting one for awhile now but its always been a bit expensive and still is. Got a really good deal with this and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My teeth thanks me daily.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great, cleans well.  However, the green button ripped and went inside so now I have a hole.  Contacted the company and because it was a gift and I did not have the receipt they did not help or honor the warranty.  I don&#x27;t normally keep receipts for two years. I might look for alternatives, it makes me sad that the company will not back its product.</li>
    <li> My old Sonicare was worn out so I ordered the same but newer version model to replace it. The unit arrived exactly as promised and I liked that Philips had used environmentally friendly packaging, I also liked that this newer version model has a more compact charging stand than the model it replaced. As expected, it worked right out of the box (with a little charging) and showed just how tired my old model had become. Now getting tingly clean teeth in half the time.</li>
    <li> Great buy to replace our 5 year old sonicare which finally stopped working.</li>
    <li> Like it.....and still am pleased with the service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a comfortable, effective toothbrush. I&#x27;m really glad I bought it. However, two features can be skipped for much cheaper models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the quadpacer (tells you when to brush a different area of your mouth) could be replaced by a cheap timer or wall clock with a second hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I&#x27;ve found the brushing modes to be inconsequential. The whitening mode just adds a 5th 30-second brushing period so that you can focus on your visible teeth. Again, with a clock, watch, or cell phone, you can do the same thing at no added cost. Even if you like the quadpacer, you can just start another round of the brushing mode to focus on your front teeth, then stop it after the first 30 seconds. I do this so I can brush my tongue and inside of my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used the massage mode and don&#x27;t quite understand why it&#x27;s useful, but maybe that adds some value to this particular model.</li>
    <li> bought product not right to fill out a review</li>
    <li> Very good tooth brush. It cleans far teeth which regular tooth brush cannot get</li>
    <li> funny on/offf. have to go through entire series of 3 buttons</li>
    <li> excellent brush, cleans much better than standard electric toothbrush</li>
    <li> I just got this an have used it only 4 days now, but I already don&#x27;t know how I&#x27;ve lived over 50++ years without it!!&lt;br /&gt;Every day my teeth feel just left the dentist clean, it is an awesome feeling.</li>
    <li> My 3rd, and best, Sonicare. Clean/Whiten setting seems very effective.</li>
    <li> Everything as advertised</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t sticky. It sticks to the charger when I pick it up the charger comes up with it and sometimes drops on the floor or hangs on the power cord. I am starting to get used to it and hold on to the charger with the other hand.</li>
    <li> A good product well ahead of the rotary brushes unit which I replaced with this one.  The vibrating head is more effective that the rotary ones which tended to pinch the lips and cause sore spots in the mouth.</li>
    <li> the best toothbrush out there I think! Works great!</li>
    <li> The feeling is awesome!</li>
    <li> What can you say about a great product that has an unacceptable flaw: planned obsolescence because of early battery death? And costs a fortune? I agree with the posts that note the longevity of older clunky Sonicare toothbrushes and the possible short life (9-18 months) of recent models, including this one. For the price, Phillips should be designing a product that can be counted on for at least two years. Mine lasted 13 months. I loved the toothbrush, but am tired of having to pay $100 plus to replace it on a yearly basis. And changing the design and model so often adds to obsolescence.</li>
    <li> The only downside to this toothbrush is that the charging base is quite small, and doesn&#x27;t have enough weight to it to keep the cord from flipping it around.  The Diamond Clean brush (considerably more expensive) has a larger base that sits a little more solidly.  For the price and for the features I REALLY need, it is totally satisfactory.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but all electric toothbrushes seem to do is vibrate in your mouth causing a lot of slobbering and drooling. I need something more mechanical.  I may try that Oral B model with the rotating head.</li>
    <li> Teeth feel so clean with the sonicare</li>
    <li> Have not come close to the year mark, so I cannot advise if the battery issues some other users experienced will happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomically, this fits my large hands very well. This will be my 2nd Sonic toothbrush and it cleans just as the previous (higher) model. It has all of the features of my previous one with the exception of the segmented battery status indicator. On this one, it is a single green LED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both had the main features I like: A vigorous brushing mode and timed brushing divided into 4 30-second parts separated by a momentary pause in the brush strokes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only star deduction is due to a feature that I believe is a design oversight. Specifically, I like the 3rd brushing mode (more vigorous) and I have to click on the button 3 times to get to it and, on subsequent uses, it still does not recall the mode I last used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not so much as a time consuming thing, but I am effectively  using and wearing down that button 3 times as much as I believe it needed to be.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush with sensitive setting works just fine.  However, there is no warning when it needs to be recharged - the little light just goes out.</li>
    <li> Getting used to ignoring the automatic timer took some time. I wish there was a way to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;I like the compact charging stand.</li>
    <li> I have one of these.  Sure it looks sleek and works well for a while, just keep your receipt because it will fail and you will need to have it replaced.  So far Phillips products we have used have all failed - all within the warranty period - this would be the toothbrush and THREE Airfloss devices.  Personally i would avoid Philips products.  the quality and reliability isnt there.</li>
    <li> Best electric toothbrush I have ever owned.  The dental hygienist has noticed improvement on my teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> This is a difference maker...it almost becomes fun to brush.  In fact, the only drawback is that I now spend a litttle more time brushing each day.  My dentist has noticed a favorable difference in both teeth and gums.  this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Cleans and whitens teeth!</li>
    <li> So far so good best Christmas present to myself I could have purchased.</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it! I really like the traveling case, after using this product I would never consider going back to a standard tooth brush</li>
    <li> I love it very happy with this toothbrush i just have to wait a little longer to see some results about whitening my teeth</li>
    <li> Great brush for the price and it cleans so well. Easy to use and battery lasts maybe a month of use between two people. Would highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Dont buy it!  Ok, I confess, I love these tooth brushes.  This is my third one.  And my last.  Yes, it does work very well and gets your teeth really clean, but it wont last longer than a year and half.  Each one failed between 1-2 years, with no warning.  The switch goes out.  If that is long enough for you, then get it.  I just feel for $100 it should last longer than that.  My wife uses the oral-B electric toothbrush and they last for years. Don&#x27;t say I didn&#x27;t warn you . . ..</li>
    <li> Stopped working after 7 months. Too expensive to replace frequently.</li>
