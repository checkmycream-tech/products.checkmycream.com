      <li>Ordering 3 more pairs!!</li>
      <li>good to keep a bandaid on during the night if you have cracked heels</li>
      <li>I have wore out one pair already plan on ordering more to have on hand always!</li>
      <li>Healthy feet is good</li>
      <li>They come in ones that have pin holes too, let&#x27;s it breathe better and is cooler, which I bought.  </li>
      <li>The moisturizer really gets soaked in and your heels feel great.</li>

      <li>These help me be able to walk all day and keep my shoes from rubbing my heel spur.  </li>
      <li>The gel heel socks are okay if I don&#x27;t walk around wearing them.</li>
      <li>Love these I wear them when I walk my heals</li>
      <li>I use them every night after showering :-)</li>
      <li>Mostly, if you have callus on your heels, slip these on, with or without socks all night.  </li>
      <li>Love these...so easy to put on heels.</li>
      <li>I have had the socks before and they are more comfortable.   </li>
      <li>They have a lot of stretch and go on easy.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;They were cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
      <li>seem comfortable.  </li>
      <li>They would be better if they were about 1/4&amp;#34; higher on the heel.</li>
      <li>They kind of too short and they are not sitting well on the hill.</li>
      <li>You will have to test out for yourself but for $5 it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
      <li>Be aware, will stretch to fit larger sizes but will change the fit and veracity of structure.  </li>
      <li>They broke the first week.</li>
      <li>still got hot spots that would become blisters</li>
      <li>Make,sure you put a moisture salve first.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve bought the booties, they are to hot an sweaty on the entire foot and the fabric type heels only dont cover much skin.</li>
      <li>I find these to be too hot to keep on for long.  </li>
      <li>different, feel squishy, but good, I was able to mow the grass with no foot pain, wouldn&#x27;t think something that thin would work, but I guess the secret is the silcone</li>
      <li>steer clear if all you want is a one time wear and it might not last till then.</li>
      <li>They do come in different sizes from a few dealers, at higher price.</li>

    <li> Awesome! Ordering 3 more pairs!!</li>
    <li> just like picture.  They helped with running shoes to stop irritating heel.</li>
    <li> They broke the first week.</li>
    <li> seem comfortable.  should come in sizes as too tight leaves marks on the ankle.</li>
    <li> These help me be able to walk all day and keep my shoes from rubbing my heel spur.  They are difficult to put socks on with them on.  They would be better if they were about 1/4&amp;#34; higher on the heel.</li>
    <li> Poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;One of them tore in half at the narrow portion - making it useless.&lt;br /&gt;In the garbage they went.&lt;br /&gt;They were cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These have helped my poor dry cracked heals.</li>
    <li> left blisters on my heels</li>
    <li> They kind of too short and they are not sitting well on the hill. They are sliding from the hill anywhere.</li>
    <li> I find these to be too hot to keep on for long.  They have a lot of stretch and go on easy.  I have tried them a couple of times and I wind up taking them off in the night.  I have had the socks before and they are more comfortable.   I don&#x27;t think I would order them again.</li>
    <li> No good waste of money.</li>
    <li> different, feel squishy, but good, I was able to mow the grass with no foot pain, wouldn&#x27;t think something that thin would work, but I guess the secret is the silcone</li>
    <li> Forgot I had them on. Invisible to the eye. NOt at all like photp ad. I wear them around the house w flip flops and I be waering them during the winter too w socks and boots. (Both seasons do I job on my heals.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took them off at night. The rubber catches on the sheets but left them on as much as possible&lt;br /&gt;w HEALTACTIC Intensive Heal Therapy. This morning dry cracks disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;one day only smooth heals.</li>
    <li> I thought they were moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Love these...so easy to put on heels. I use them every night after showering :-)</li>
    <li> Love these I wear them when I walk my heals always got blisters when I walked, not any more. I have wore out one pair already plan on ordering more to have on hand always!</li>
    <li> Make,sure you put a moisture salve first. Healthy feet is good</li>
    <li> These have been a blessing.  I have had severe issue with cracking heels &amp; with salve &amp; these while I sleep has helped immensely.  One not would be you need to where a lite pair of socks over or they get caught on the bedding.  I have already ordered 2 different times, They are always delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> Mostly, if you have callus on your heels, slip these on, with or without socks all night.  The moisturizer really gets soaked in and your heels feel great. Will not remove callus you have to do that before but does prevent/delay callus and cracking. Bought a 2nd one already. Will definitely buy again..  They come in ones that have pin holes too, let&#x27;s it breathe better and is cooler, which I bought.  I have also wore it during the daytime, all day in the house, stays on.  Be aware, will stretch to fit larger sizes but will change the fit and veracity of structure.  You will have to test out for yourself but for $5 it&#x27;s worth a try.  The majority that says one size fits all, run small. 6 1/2 women fits perfectly. They do come in different sizes from a few dealers, at higher price. One size fits all never does. Silicone gets sticky from use, sun, body heat, moisturizers, soap.  It will need to be replaced just like socks, dependent on usage but does last if careful.</li>
    <li> The gel heel socks are okay if I don&#x27;t walk around wearing them.</li>
    <li> This item arrived when expected, but it not quite what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> They make the heal sweat so I&#x27;ll go back to gel socks.</li>
    <li> This is perfectly what I&#x27;ve been wishing for.  It protects the cracks at night and is hand washable with soap and water.</li>
    <li> steer clear if all you want is a one time wear and it might not last till then.</li>
    <li> still got hot spots that would become blisters</li>
    <li> Hate my yukky heels but these help. I&#x27;ve bought the booties, they are to hot an sweaty on the entire foot and the fabric type heels only dont cover much skin. Theses are the best!</li>
