<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this soap!  The effect it has on my skin and my elderly mother&#x27;s skin is fantastic.  It keeps the skin soft and supple and it doesn&#x27;t irritate either.  That&#x27;s very important for my mom who has very senstivie skin.  The lavendar smell also helps to soothe my sense of tranquilty for me and my mom.</li>
    <li> I love Alpen Secrets Cleansing Goat Milk Soap, scented with lavender. It smells so good in the shower and has a nice lather, can&#x27;t wait to order again !!!!!</li>
    <li> This soap is excellent and an incredible deal. One bar of similar soap would cost $5 - $7 in a store. The lavender scent is pretty mild, definitely not over powering. My boyfriend uses it too so it is a universal product. I have sensitive skin and this product is calm and soothing. It is also very moisturizing and never causes itching like the big name brand soaps do. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a moisturizing body soap.</li>
    <li> Could smell a bit better but not bad overall . It washes off  and soaps up easily . Smells fine but a bit strong to my taste . Not a bad quality for the price .</li>
    <li> Like the smell and fresh feeling...will buy again</li>
    <li> Goats milk is very gentle on the skin and this is fragrance free. I&#x27;ve been using a bar in the shower for a couple of weeks now and the bar hasn&#x27;t worn away and faster than other bars would</li>
    <li> love this goats  milk soap, I use it along with the foaming milk bath.,  leaves skin feeling great and no residual films on the tub.</li>
    <li> The fragrance of this soap has been changed since the last time I purchased it.  It used to have a nice goat milk smell with a back note of real lavender.  Now it has an overpowering fake lavender aftershave-type fragrance.  The soap is still creamy and lathers well, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase it again as I&#x27;m not a fan of the new fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was looking for two things in this soap, longer-lasting and a natural lavender smell. So far it appears to be holding its own in the lasting department (I have three small kids, we do a lot of hand-washing), but the smell is definitely not natural lavender, or even the less expensive lavendin. It is definitely in the perfume-like category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A perk has been that my daughter (6) loves it, and it turns out to be the brand and scent my husband used while visiting his grandmother growing up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re going to be buying more of this brand in unscented or maybe oatmeal.</li>
    <li> too greasy even wash out several times.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try goat soap, I heard it was healthier then others. This was a little more pricier than I was expecting. I would probably use it again.</li>
    <li> Meh. Thought I&#x27;d try it based on other reviews touting how great it is for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s drying for my skin. And this is in spring, when I&#x27;m less prone to dry skin. If you&#x27;re looking for a good sensitive skin soap, find one with goat milk higher on the ingredient list. I will go back to buying mine at the local natural foods stores.</li>
    <li> Good soap to use during winter. Pleasing and calming Lavender scent.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Very mild. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> I have been an avid user of goat milk soap with lavender oil for some years..this is my first purchase of Alpen Secrets ...I returned 3 bars after opening the box and not finding the refreshing smell of lavender.  I will say that the bar I showered with did a good job of lathering and rinsing cleanly but i missed that lavender smell!  The three stars is not to say this isn&#x27;t good soap...only that I really love the smell of lavender and it wasn&#x27;t apparent in this brand.</li>
    <li> This was my 1st purchase of commercially made goat milk soap and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Fragrance is pleasant but not overpowering. Feels clean and non drying on skin.</li>
    <li> This soap smells fabulous, not too strong but a lovely lavender smell.  It is large, not the size of a handmade bar of soap but more like a commercial bar of Lever.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is a bit irritating to my skin.  I do have very, very sensitive skin.  Until I tried this bar I had been using the vegetable oil soap from Trader Joe&#x27;s which seems to be the only soap I have found which does not irritate the delicate parts of my body.  The irritation from this soap does not last long and does not produce a rash but it does burn for a little while after use.  I have checked the ingredients and cannot figure out what is causing the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;But for those who do not have super sensitive skin and want a lovely, smooth, great smelling bath soap - this is it!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin. This stuff is great and smells wonderful (a very, light scent, which is so nice). I also use this for my five year old daughter, who also has my skin type.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this soap cleanses without drying my skin.  I&#x27;ve had other lavender soaps whose scent I preferred to this one, but there is nothing off-putting about this one  ... it&#x27;s just my personal preference.</li>
    <li> nice soap.  lots of lather and makes skin soft.  doesn&#x27;t smell as lavendery as other soaps. no i will not add 4 words</li>
    <li> Goat milk soap is great choice for aging skin. I use to buy it homemade but it didn&#x27;t last long. This lasts much longer. Lavender fragrance is not too strong.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleanser and naturally appealing fragrance.  The goat milk serves to moisturize the skin.  That is why I chose this soap product.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great and makes our skin feel clean and soft. No residue left behind on skim or shower. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this soap! It&#x27;s smooth, lathers great, and smells great but not too strong. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> I like the soap simply because I like the idea of goatsmilk products. I bought it as sort of a novelty and the multi bar pack has lasted me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one critique is that they aren&#x27;t scented enough. This obviously varies based on preference but for me this soap has a VERY light lavender scent. You sort of get used to it and then you smell no lavender at all (unless you&#x27;re looking for it). Of course for some people this will be perfect as the smell is not at all overwhelming. I prefer the soap I&#x27;ve purchased from logs at Whole Foods (I can&#x27;t remember the brand). It has extremely concentrated scents, and I love the way it perfumes my entire bathroom after a shower.</li>
    <li> WILL BUY THIS AS LONG AS I CAN.YOUR SKIN FEELS SO SOFT.</li>
    <li> Great soap. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but does leave a nice squeaky clean feel.</li>
    <li> A lovely smelling, soft sudsing soap. It leaves skin smooth and moist. Gentle for exzema sufferers&lt;br /&gt;and children. Cheaper that Canus and longer lasting...</li>
    <li> I was using the none fragrance. This is Alot better. fragrance is very light. Smells very fresh.</li>
    <li> Aspen goat milk soap is a great soap. A mile scent of lavender. Leave your skin feeling fresh and clean. I would recommend this soap to anybody who wants a organic soap. And the price is great.</li>
    <li> My entire family has sensitive skin or skin problems and evyone can use this soup without drying or irritation .</li>
    <li> Goat&#x27;s milk soap keeps my dry winter skin nice and hydrated. This one foams up nicely as well and feels luxurious. The lavender scent is barely there when you&#x27;re using it and fades very quickly after rinsing.</li>
    <li> Love this soap...have given it to several friends and family and they all rave about it.</li>
    <li> The soap is very gentle with a nourishing clean feel to the skin.  It has a nice light perfume.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I wanted a soap that was less drying and more soothing than other soaps.  I have seen a lot of soap makers at our local farmers market but to me their prices were a bit on the high side.  Soo I went to Amazon and found this.  It does not irritate and it smells good.  I have not had any itchiness or irritation when using this.  The smell will not overpower you either.  All in all this is a very good product and I am happy with it.  If it helps in the winter with dry skin I would even give it more stars but I will see.  Overall this is a good value.</li>
    <li> smells good and I like how it lathers up</li>
    <li> My baby was breaking out from regular baby soaps, so our pediatrician recommended goat milk soap.  I purchased this and some pure unrefined shea butter, and her skin has been golden ever since.  Works great and lasts FOREVER!!</li>
    <li> What a great soap!  The lathering and aroma is great.  The bar lasts longer than most bars of soap.  I have given these away also as gifts.  I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> Even my five and eight year old love this soap. It is great to be able to use a natural product that actually works and lathers. This does in fact lather well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this soap a few days and it&#x27;s really a great product.  My face is no longer red when I come out of the shower.  Even my feet seem to like this soap.  They don&#x27;t seem to be as rough and chapped but this is a \\&quot;wait and see\\&quot; area I think.&lt;br /&gt;This soap has a very \\&quot;clean\\&quot; smell.  It&#x27;s hard to explain but if you&#x27;ve ever walked past someone in the store and they have that noticeably clean smell, well this is that smell.  Not perfumery or heavy, just nice and...........well clean is the only word that comes to mind.  It&#x27;s a shame this product has to be labeled as a soap.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as harsh as a soap.  It&#x27;s more of a cleansing cream wash.  Very creamy without the oil.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and find that most soaps don&#x27;t leave my skin as moisturized as promised (Dove!). I always moisturize after showering, but before the day is through, my skin is already feeling tight and leave white streaks if I scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since I started using Alpen (several years ago), I haven&#x27;t had that problem. I still need moisturizer after a shower, but it lasts All Day, AND I use Less moisturizer at that!  I wash with shower gloves instead of a wash cloth (faster and easier) and find I don&#x27;t need to constantly re-soap the gloves -- twice is all I need, if that. Once for my legs and arms, again for my torso and face. The smell is not overwhelming, the lather is rich and creamy, plus, the soap stays firm till almost the very end and adheres to the next bar for dear life - nothing gets wasted.</li>
    <li> They changed the formula. Not the same. I had it on subscribe-and-save and I was really surprised when it was a different formula. I wanted to like it, but it was totally different from the old formula. NOT EVEN CLOSE.</li>
    <li> I like this soap and will order again.  I smells great. Well worth the money. I like fresh clean smells. I have bought other goat milk soaps and I really like this one.</li>
    <li> This soap is a good mild moisturizing soap with a nice relaxing scent, &amp; it does not cause any problems with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> When I ordered, the full ingredient list was not available.  Unfortunately these soaps contain Sodium Tallowate, which is animal fat.  I&#x27;m a vegetarian and do not want to lather myself with the left over product from dead cattle.  Goat milk soaps are the best for eczema, I guess using organic would be the way to go.</li>
    <li> My mom uses it for her facial cleansing.  It&#x27;s mild and soft for her face.  Good product at a reasonal price.</li>
    <li> As I have gotten older, regular face soap has made my skin dry and sensitive.  A friend suggested Goat Milk soap and am I glad that she did.  No more itching or dry patches.  Glad that I could find it at Amazon and not have to travel to another area to buy at a higher price in a specialty store.</li>
    <li> It is not creamy enough. It really does not Lather up, it is too mild for me. I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> This soap is so gentle for my sensitive skin and it smells lovely. My husband is a picky soap snob and he loves it as well. One of our favorites</li>
    <li> I enjoy this goat&#x27;s milk soap, which has a lightly scented natural lavender aroma. I will buy this again, the scent is heavenly and relaxing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so good and I&#x27;m very like it! and my friend all like this gift! It&#x27;s so good and I&#x27;m very like it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is GREAT! Smells good, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, is moisturizing, and all-natural. My only (very small) complaint is that it clogs up my drain sometimes after I do a full-body wash. That&#x27;s what happens when you get a nice thick organic soap, though. Worth it!</li>
    <li> This is a great price and a natural lavender smell coupled with great suds&#x3D;clean body. Four bars for under $8 is nothing to sneeze at, and you won&#x27;t anyway cuz this soap is natural fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it leaves my skin soft and refine</li>
    <li> This is the only bar soap we now use.  I consider it the best soap purchasable, much better than even some higher price soaps. For those of you who have dealt with cleaning soap scum off shower tiles or other areas, this is the soap for you.  It leaves absolutely no soap scum.  It lathers up beautifully, cleans as good as any other soap I&#x27;ve ever used, and leaves your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  The lavender smell is quite subtle, not overwhelming.  I&#x27;ve also used their oat soap, which is also good.  It lasts quite a long time, and stays together until the very last, smallest part of it remains, so there is very little waste to any bar; none, actually.  The fact that is doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or soap scum is its greatest feature for me, though, as I got so tired of scrubbing and scrubbing yet would still have a &#x27;white residue&#x27; on my tile walls and floor from using regular grocery-store brand soaps.  And the price of it makes it a good value.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> i like this soap; really leaves you squeaky clean</li>
    <li> Very good soap, very good not great. Has a very very good smell to it and it&#x27;s strong enough smell to make your bathroom smell awesome. Has a good lather, not a great lather but it does the job. Leaves skin very clean and not dry. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I love these, trying to eliminate chemicals in my life and these are working!!</li>
    <li> I love this soap! It smells neutrally and it makes skin softer. Highly recommended for those who like natural products.</li>
    <li> I got these soaps because a friend told me how wonderful Goat milk soap are.  And is true.  Great for the skin.  I will not use any other soap again. Thanks</li>
    <li> This soap is ideal for sensitive skin.  I love the lavender scent, but have also purchased the fragrance free version.  Both are gentle and leave your skin feeling great.  The scent is not overpowering, just a hint of summer in the air.</li>
    <li> We love this soap, it smells SO clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  Now I can cover my whole body with one lathering.  It spreads very good.  My skin feels squeaky-clean. So far my skin has not had any irritation.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful, and lasts a long time using every day, really like it...skin is softer too, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a smooth soap with subtle and soothing aroma. I like it on my hands and in the shower.</li>
    <li> Awesome soap! So fresh and so clean. Very affordable. Leaves skin soft, silky and smooth! Would recommend to anyone. Will be making another purchase here very soon.</li>
    <li> It has a nice scent and the goat&#x27;s milk is so moisturizing.  Regular soap tends ti dry the skin out.  I recommend this soap.</li>
