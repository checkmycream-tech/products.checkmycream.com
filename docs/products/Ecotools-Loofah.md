<ol>
      <li>It fits great!</li>
      <li>I initially loved this shower cap!  </li>
      <li>Great lining and good elastic.</li>
      <li>good at all.</li>
      <li>This shower cap is wonderful, it has very soft lining on the inside and feels great against the skin.</li>
      <li>but I sure hope it lasts for a while!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really cute!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice that the cap is eco-friendly, but if doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed to do, then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
      <li>It looks and feels really nice</li>
      <li>This shower cap and its pouch is really cute, good colors, material is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Fits</li>
      <li>The cotton lining feels nice and the sizing is fine.</li>
      <li>It was comfortable, attractive, and high quality.  </li>
      <li>molded very quickly even with air moving through shower.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
      <li>I look super cool in it, or I assume so based on my babies</li>
      <li>I like that it is eco-friendly and economical as well.</li>
      <li>but I feels as large or larger than my Goody one from the grocery store and is more than fine for my shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>Fit is perfect with plenty of room if you have long or thick hair.</li>
      <li>sure for bigger heads!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The cap is able to stretch over my ears and Keeps my head dry.</li>

      <li>I used this shower cap for many months with no issues - no leaking as noted by some other reviewers.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair from getting wet just fine.</li>
      <li>I have bought a few just to make sure I have extras in case</li>
      <li>I loved this shower cap at first, but after a few months of use, the colored, printed parts started flaking off and now little bits of it</li>
      <li>and it is very soft.</li>
      <li>It has an inner cloth lining and seems pretty durable.  </li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry very well between uses</li>
      <li>However, after several uses, the cloth interior became damp and, unlike other plastic shower caps, didn&#x27;t dry out very quickly.  </li>

<li> keep your hair dry!  </li>
<li> well to my head(my head is not much big and have hairs little below shoudlers).&lt;br /&gt;Cap is holding my all hairs in it, didn&#x27;t get wet at all.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>

    <li> I was looking for a shower cap.  Well I got what I wanted.  I have a med lg head and a thick head of hair.  The cap is able to stretch over my ears and Keeps my head dry.</li>
    <li> I loved this shower cap at first, but after a few months of use, the colored, printed parts started flaking off and now little bits of it get EVERYWHERE when I use it.  Really annoying.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shower cap. Not much can be said. It keeps my hair from getting wet just fine.</li>
    <li> Just received my cap today. It looks and feels really nice but it&#x27;s a different pattern than the one pictured. It&#x27;s teal and green with chevron stripes and leaves. It&#x27;s really cute! I included a picture. The cotton lining feels nice and the sizing is fine. Others said it was small but I feels as large or larger than my Goody one from the grocery store and is more than fine for my shoulder length hair. Will update on performance later.</li>
    <li> This shower cap and its pouch is really cute, good colors, material is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Fits well to my head(my head is not much big and have hairs little below shoudlers).&lt;br /&gt;Cap is holding my all hairs in it, didn&#x27;t get wet at all.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure for bigger heads!&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this products for others...</li>
    <li> Wow. Finally a nice shower cap without terrible cheeseball designs. Great lining and good elastic. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I initially loved this shower cap!  It was comfortable, attractive, and high quality.  However, after several uses, the cloth interior became damp and, unlike other plastic shower caps, didn&#x27;t dry out very quickly.  It wasn&#x27;t long before the inside was covered with mold.  I bleached the shower cap trying to prevent it from ending up in the trash, but that&#x27;s ultimately where it ended up after just a few of months of use.</li>
    <li> molded very quickly even with air moving through shower. it didn&#x27;t come out with washing either. i had to throw it out.</li>
    <li> This is very small. If you have a lot of hair, this will not work. Very dissapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> Like the storage bag for it that comes with it</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in and the water out. My head doesn&#x27;t get sweaty. I look super cool in it, or I assume so based on my babies smiles when I put it on. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. Doesn&#x27;t feel scratchy or itchy.</li>
    <li> This shower cap appeared to be high quality when I first received it.  It has an inner cloth lining and seems pretty durable.  However, it doesn&#x27;t do what a shower cap should do....keep your hair dry!  The area about 2 inches from the band gets soaked each time I use it and my hair is wet (not just damp) in a number of spots. .  It&#x27;s nice that the cap is eco-friendly, but if doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s designed to do, then what&#x27;s the point?</li>
    <li> This shower cap is small. The fabric inside gets wet. Mold grew and had to throw it away.</li>
    <li> Useless. Once it gets wet, it starts to stink, like a wet sponge that just didn&#x27;t dry properly. Gross.</li>
    <li> How much can I say about a shower cap?  It keeps my hair dry while I shower and it is very soft. I have bought a few just to make sure I have extras in case it is  discontinued</li>
    <li> I used this shower cap for many months with no issues - no leaking as noted by some other reviewers. I like that it is eco-friendly and economical as well. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I agree with several other reviews.  The cotton liner gets wet and worse yet it takes days to dry resulting in a stain on the cotton liner.&lt;br /&gt;Not good at all.</li>
    <li> This shower cap is wonderful, it has very soft lining on the inside and feels great against the skin. Fit is perfect with plenty of room if you have long or thick hair. And I like the colors! Would buy this product again in the future but I sure hope it lasts for a while!</li>
    <li> I would order this shower cap again. It fits great! However, the package it came in isn&#x27;t necessary which I find non-eco-friendly.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry very well between uses</li>
