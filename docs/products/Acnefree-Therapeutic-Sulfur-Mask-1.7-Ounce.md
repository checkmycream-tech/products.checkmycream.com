      <li>Great product, gets the job done.</li>
      <li>If you suffer with body acne be sure to sleep in cotton pajamas or change your sheets every couple of days!</li>
      <li>I love this mask too!  </li>
      <li>I have been pleased with the results and glad to find something effective for both our skin types (oily&amp;normal)</li>
      <li>I love the smell though :)</li>
      <li>Now, we&#x27;ve finally found the perfect combination of products that work!!</li>
      <li>Love it, will buy it again from amazon.</li>
      <li>Like most adults plagued with acne, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything OTC and not.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena and Clean &amp; Clear have Cleansers &amp; Treatment Gels that are both wonderful but by far, the most effective thing in this routine is the \\&quot;Oil Cleansing Method\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>: Change your pillowcase often, keep your phone CLEAN and increase your water intake.</li>
      <li>My face feels clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried different clay masks, but none work as good as this to pull out the oil.</li>
      <li>I find this product easy to use and reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>Rarely, will ONE product get the job done unless you are lucky</li>
      <li>This mask gives your face a very fresh and healthy glow,the sulphur mask is like putting on the final touches of your makeup.</li>
      <li>It left my skin smooth and &amp;#34;AcneFree&amp;#34;, i would highly recommend this product, would have liked if this came in a bigger package, but so far a good product, just make sure you use some sort of lotion after, since it may leave your skin feel a bit dry.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin soft an smooth.</li>
      <li>Oh, one more thing, during the warmer months my son who plays a lot of baseball uses a Body Acne Spray on his back containing 2% Salicylic Acid after showering.</li>
      <li>My teenage son has tried so many products for acne.</li>
      <li>so your face doesnt think its dry and then produce more oil.</li>
      <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I find my skin smoother and if blemishes come they are smaller and go away quickly!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the entire AcneFree line.  </li>
      <li>We REALLY noticed an improvement as soon as he began this.</li>
      <li>Just for use to much or else your skin will get use to it.</li>
      <li>I have had breakouts since my mid-twenties, and this mask seems to really help.</li>
      <li>Not irritating at all.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Better than other brands to clear acne</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had new breakouts and the inflammation in my problem areas</li>
      <li>It shrinks the large cysts and eliminates some of the smaller whiteheads as well.</li>
      <li>I now see a dermatologist again, but before I went back, I absolutely could not do without this product.</li>
      <li>Yes, this stuff works for adult cystic acne.  </li>
      <li>Benzoyl Peroxide Cleansers &amp; Treatments do absolutely nothing for his teenage acne and oral medications had side effects that prevented him from using them.</li>
      <li>I use it about once a week because as soon as I eat sugar, I developed pimples although I am over 50.</li>
      <li>I just follow the directions to leave on for ten minutes and by the next morning my face is significantly clearer and no new spots.</li>
      <li>Just helps get rid of excess oil and generally cleans the skin.</li>
      <li>I use it alone with glotherapeutics Clear Skin Kit and definitely see the difference.</li>
      <li>&amp; I am a 47 yr old female.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> I use it about once a week because as soon as I eat sugar, I developed pimples although I am over 50.</li>
    <li> after using the acnefree 3-step system, I use the mask every other day as the label states. This mask gives your face a very fresh and healthy glow,the sulphur mask is like putting on the final touches of your makeup. Love it, will buy it again from amazon. Service was great also.</li>
    <li> Very good product.  I used it on skin some skin problems on my chest, also on sebaceous cyst and it cleared them up.</li>
    <li> Great acne mask for the price.</li>
    <li> Every time I use this it makes my acne worse.  I doubt it does this to others, but I cannot use this product :( I love the smell though :)</li>
    <li> I was a bit worried about using this item, i was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t work, but i was wrong. Its been about 2 to 3 weeks and the product works. I get black heads and prior to this product i been using Proactiv Mask, and although at times i would get results with the Proactiv mask, it didn&#x27;t remove my blackheads. I didn&#x27;t get the best results with the Proactiv Mask, where as this AcneFree Therapeutic product i got the results in matter of weeks. It left my skin smooth and &amp;#34;AcneFree&amp;#34;, i would highly recommend this product, would have liked if this came in a bigger package, but so far a good product, just make sure you use some sort of lotion after, since it may leave your skin feel a bit dry.</li>
    <li> I have awful cystic acne and haven&#x27;t hardly found anything that helps. I&#x27;ve tried different clay masks, but none work as good as this to pull out the oil. I&#x27;m finding that sulfur may be the key to perhaps defeating this curse.</li>
    <li> This is a very good acne spot treatment. Just for use to much or else your skin will get use to it.</li>
    <li> I only have occasional breakouts, but this is about the only thing that stops it from spreading once one starts. I just follow the directions to leave on for ten minutes and by the next morning my face is significantly clearer and no new spots. I always keep this in stock at my house.</li>
    <li> Product was great...the length of time it took to be delivered was not so great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great mask. Walmart&amp; Walgreens used to sell it. but I havent seen it in stores ;o( but I am happy with its drying properties. just use a moisturizer so your face doesnt think its dry and then produce more oil.</li>
    <li> Helps to even out my skin texture and tone - the only down size is I have two small dry areas on the cheeks that it makes slightly worse but nothing a little lotion doesn&#x27;t help. I find my skin smoother and if blemishes come they are smaller and go away quickly!</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Simple and easy to use. Quick relief of painful acne. When I use it the acne is almost gone after 10-20 minutes. It shrinks the large cysts and eliminates some of the smaller whiteheads as well. It leaves my skin soft an smooth. It can be drying, so I can only use it every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently on 2 prescriptions for acne. I use clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel AM and trentinoin cream PM and I still have acne. If I miss more than one dose of these medications I have painful cystic acne on my jawline and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only product that works after years of trying everything on the market plus 2 rx antibiotic pills that have awful side effects. Proactive worked for me, but I just can&#x27;t do the 3 step regime 3 times a day! I used to buy this at walmart, but I can&#x27;t find it anywhere now.</li>
    <li> This works well for me and my daughter. I have been pleased with the results and glad to find something effective for both our skin types (oily&amp;normal)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t develop acne until my thirties.  This is the only thing that works without the irritation of the brands marketed towards the teenaged crowd.</li>
    <li> I have been using the face mask on and off. I use it alone with glotherapeutics Clear Skin Kit and definitely see the difference.</li>
    <li> Yes, this stuff works for adult cystic acne.  Sulfur is at 3.5% (prescription at 5%).  Parts of my face get so oily - forehead, nose, and chin that if my hair touches my face it absorbs the oil and gets gross.  Now, this is not according to the instructions, but I will put this on the oily parts of my face at night and go to bed.  My skin does not get dried out doing this.  Again I have extremely oily skin &amp; I am a 47 yr old female.  If I have a break out the sulfur helps to keep it from getting too out of control.  I now see a dermatologist again, but before I went back, I absolutely could not do without this product. Can also get at Walgreens &amp; Walmart, however sometimes they are out of it.</li>
    <li> Like most adults plagued with acne, I&#x27;ve tried just about everything OTC and not.  My dermatologist recommended this mask and I now use it about every other day.  I haven&#x27;t had new breakouts and the inflammation in my problem areas has decreased significantly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the entire AcneFree line.  I love this mask too!  It seems to help prevent acne when used in conjunction with the AcneFree Trio.  It seems to help existing pimples heal quicker.  AcneFree products CAN be a bit drying (especially in a cold, winter climate).  I always end up using an additional moisturizer day and night.  I find this product easy to use and reasonably priced.  Also, it&#x27;s small and travels well.</li>
    <li> My teenage son has tried so many products for acne. Benzoyl Peroxide Cleansers &amp; Treatments do absolutely nothing for his teenage acne and oral medications had side effects that prevented him from using them. Now, we&#x27;ve finally found the perfect combination of products that work!! Acne prevention takes good hygiene and commitment!! Rarely, will ONE product get the job done unless you are lucky so here is a morning and evening routine for Teenage Acne Prevention:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A.M.&lt;br /&gt;1. Oil Cleansing Method: Cleanse face with a mixture of Organic, Cold Pressed Castor &amp; Sunflower Oil to heal/protect!!!&lt;br /&gt;2. Salicylic Acid Treatment Gel: Apply to face in breakout \\&quot;zone\\&quot; after cleansing for blackhead clearing &amp; pimple prevention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.M.&lt;br /&gt;1. Salicylic Acid Cleanser: Cleanse face in the shower &amp; use Dial Antibacterial Body Wash for body acne.&lt;br /&gt;2. ACNEFREE SULFUR MASK - Apply to face on existing pimples or breakout \\&quot;zone\\&quot; before bed &amp; leave overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many products contain 2% Salicylic Acid which is what you want to look for. Neutrogena and Clean &amp; Clear have Cleansers &amp; Treatment Gels that are both wonderful but by far, the most effective thing in this routine is the \\&quot;Oil Cleansing Method\\&quot;. Do some research on \\&quot;cleansing with oil\\&quot; to see all of the benefits! We REALLY noticed an improvement as soon as he began this. When you get your acne under control the Salicylic Acid Gel and Acnefree Sulfur Mask can be used less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERY person is different so everyone&#x27;s acne problem is different so YOU will have to figure out the best way to use these products but IF try this routine, you won&#x27;t be sorry! Oh, one more thing, during the warmer months my son who plays a lot of baseball uses a Body Acne Spray on his back containing 2% Salicylic Acid after showering. Neutrogena has one that works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Change your pillowcase often, keep your phone CLEAN and increase your water intake. If you suffer with body acne be sure to sleep in cotton pajamas or change your sheets every couple of days! Your bedding soaks up body oils, hair products, etc. Best of luck!n cotton pajamas or change your sheets every couple of days! Your bedding soaks up body oils, hair products, etc. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> Great product, gets the job done. My face feels clean afterwards. I have no issues with the product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR REFINING PORES OVERNIGHT</li>
    <li> I have had breakouts since my mid-twenties, and this mask seems to really help. I highly recommend it. Not irritating at all. Just helps get rid of excess oil and generally cleans the skin.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.  I use it at least three times a week and it helps eliminate my acne.</li>
    <li> The product is great, my review is to warn people not to over pay! This is listed as 20+ dollars. You can get 1 bottle at Ulta for 7.99</li>
    <li> Works like it&#x27;s suppose too. Better than other brands to clear acne</li>
</ol>
