      <li>miracle is right.</li>
      <li>Most of the over the counter stuff I purchased didn&#x27;t do much, and because she is so young (10)</li>
      <li>exactly what it is.</li>
      <li>The first package of the bye bye acne feel it formula has expired since 2011.</li>
      <li>This is is the only product I&#x27;m able to use on my face.</li>
      <li>And it works FAST!  </li>
      <li>Weve tried all the popular, widely advertised products.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results.</li>
      <li>I feel more confident and laugh a lot more compared to in the past, without worrying about the other person staring at my acne.</li>
      <li>I used to have very oily skin</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t do really anything.</li>
      <li>The toner smells like straight witchhazel.</li>
      <li>This product has improved my skin so much, clearing spots and breakouts.</li>
      <li>Felt like they really didn&#x27;t care for my business, so I really don&#x27;t care to ever order from this company again.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I think I was just expecting to much to fast.</li>
      <li>Wow!!...</li>
      <li>This is the only one that really works for my beautiful half AA, half Guatamalan daughter.</li>
      <li>My daughter began having severe acne breakouts, many large knots that left lots of dark scars on her forehead.</li>
      <li>I couldnt find it anywhere in the stores here where i live anymore,</li>
      <li>I bought this for someone else and from what they say this works fine; no side effects, no issues and it does cut down on the acne.</li>
      <li>This has worked really good for my african american teenage daughter for the past couple of years, used many other acne products that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>I have had trouble in the past where I found that the product wasn&#x27;t working as great as before</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s face is clear, most of the dark marks have completely faded, and her entire personality has changed!    </li>
      <li>you can think of ...trying to clear my face.</li>
      <li>The Walmart near me used to carry it</li>
      <li>Trust me people I&#x27;ve used it all, had acne since I was 11 years old</li>
      <li>I have also used their GRO OIL serum and my natural hair</li>
      <li>its clearer and softer -i would recommend this product for sensitive skin as well</li>
      <li>I am 44 years young and have been using this acne treatment system for about 3 years now</li>
      <li>The same toner from my local beauty supply has a fresh scent to it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Neutrogena, Noxema, clean and clear, and some other products that claim to  be for African American skin and nothing works like this.</li>
      <li>I use it enough to clear up my issues</li>
      <li>but I would recommend this product to everyone, especially people with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I decided to wait a few weeks before writing this review in order to test out the product, and let me say it was worth it.</li>
      <li>It smells different (worse) and it&#x27;s more watery</li>
      <li>product is extremely hard to find &amp; kind of expensive ($20 for a box) but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>I wanted to find out more information about a few other products but my inquiries went completely unanswered.</li>
      <li>(we all know the one, starts with a &#x27;p&#x27;) with little to no results, honestly I thought it made it worse.</li>

<li> Their prices are very competitive, but $20 is usually the price range.  </li>
<li> long story short, it changed my life... still using it till this day!</li>
<li> But now after reading all of the other reviews about how their skin feels smoother and softer, I am going to start using it twice a day as a daily and nightly regime.  </li>
<li> none worked till I stumble upon this at Walmart! ...</li>
<li> I must say that it does dry the skin out</li>
<li> but I think that maybe theyre using too much, a little definitely goes a long way with this moisturizer.</li>
<li> I WILL NOT use any other brand ever again.  </li>
<li> After about 2 weeks I noticed the difference and so did other&#x27;s.</li>
<li> However, I feel like the formula has been changed a bit because it doesn&#x27;t feel as tingly as usual but regardless, with regular use, my skin is a lot clearer.</li>
<li> I have tried every other brand u can name</li>
<li> Something is not right with this product.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical at first, the &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; part threw me for a loop....</li>
<li> My mother recommended it to me; and after about 2 weeks of using it my blemishes greatly decreased, some scarring lightened, I had a glow, and my skin was extremely soft.</li>
<li> It is hard to find, but some of my local Wal-marts carry it in beside the black hair care products.</li>
<li> I suffer from black spots along side</li>
<li> My money was wasted purchasing this product.</li>
<li> I tried and wasted my money on quite a lot of products out there</li>
<li> I use it twice a day, everyday!</li>
<li> I really would recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s suffers from breakouts!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this for someone else and from what they say this works fine; no side effects, no issues and it does cut down on the acne. Great product is their verdict.</li>
    <li> Luv this stuff-my face thanks u!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best product for African American skin or even just Ethnic skin. It cleared up a bad breakout I had from Birth Control I was on and my regular acne. I tried everything to get the scars on my face off and nothing worked. Until a Dr. Miracles Rep was in the store and they were out at the store I was in and he saw my face and he went out and gave me a free kit to start me off. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Trust me people I&#x27;ve used it all, had acne since I was 11 years old I&#x27;m 25 now.</li>
    <li> My daughter began having severe acne breakouts, many large knots that left lots of dark scars on her forehead. Most of the over the counter stuff I purchased didn&#x27;t do much, and because she is so young (10) I didn&#x27;t want to use something that made it worse.    My sister told me to try this, and I was very skeptical, but it has truly been a MIRACLE in our lives! My daughter&#x27;s face is clear, most of the dark marks have completely faded, and her entire personality has changed!    It is hard to find, but some of my local Wal-marts carry it in beside the black hair care products. We are African American, but I would advise anyone to give this a try . . . it is amazing.    P.S. Some are put off because the leave on lotion uses castor oil. But I have found that it keeps your skin from getting too dry from the benzoyl peroxide and if you use a very thin layer as advised your skin will not appear too oily.    A final tip is to wash your face and use the toner, then get dressed before you put on the leave on lotion, as benzoyl peroxide can bleach your clothes.</li>
    <li> great product well worth it....just one suggestion though, it needs to have a blk mark fade cream included....&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
    <li> This product works well on my skin!!! I have used it for 2 years. Would recommend to anyone and will use again</li>
    <li> I have had acne since I was a kid and I am now 21. This is the only product that has managed to clear my skin including my acne scars which was the worst part. I couldnt find it anywhere in the stores here where i live anymore, so glad i found it here. It worked miracles for me honestly.</li>
    <li> Weve tried all the popular, widely advertised products. This is the only one that really works for my beautiful half AA, half Guatamalan daughter.</li>
    <li> I would not buy this product anymore because it causes more breakouts on the face &amp; the discolorations are getting darker instead of lighter.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended my a friend who happens to be female model, so beauty is her life. I decided to wait a few weeks before writing this review in order to test out the product, and let me say it was worth it. I was a bit sceptical as I tried a similar product (we all know the one, starts with a &#x27;p&#x27;) with little to no results, honestly I thought it made it worse. Dr. Miracle however started working almost a week in. It has been 3 weeks and 2 days (today) since I started using this product &#x27;religiously/daily&#x27; 2x a day, and I myself have seen significant changes and so does everyone else around me. I feel more confident and laugh a lot more compared to in the past, without worrying about the other person staring at my acne. I recommend this product to anyone with acne problems, as for me when I wake up with a pimple I no longer squeeze them I just do the daily regimen and they disappear in 1-2 days, sometimes the same day. Wow!!... oh did I mention you also feel the treatment tingle as it works....Yeah it does, it also feels like a burning feeling, well to me anyway.</li>
    <li> I struggled with bad acne for years. Went through products &amp; more products and nothing worked.  My mother recommended it to me; and after about 2 weeks of using it my blemishes greatly decreased, some scarring lightened, I had a glow, and my skin was extremely soft. I used to have very oily skin &amp; I believe this product helped with that, I now have a combination skin type. A lot of people complain about the repairing lotion having castor oil &amp; it being oily but I think that maybe theyre using too much, a little definitely goes a long way with this moisturizer. I am African American but I would recommend this product to everyone, especially people with sensitive skin. It&#x27;s not too harsh and it&#x27;s not too gentle. It gets the job done but only if you use it as instructed (morning &amp; night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. product is extremely hard to find &amp; kind of expensive ($20 for a box) but it&#x27;s worth it. The Walmart near me used to carry it but they&#x27;ve stopped. I now get mine from a beauty supply store. However, I found that not all carry it. Also make sure to check the expiration date before purchasing. I have had trouble in the past where I found that the product wasn&#x27;t working as great as before and then I discovered that it had expired 2 yrs ago.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I&#x27;ve been fighting with bad acnee for 29 years!! This product is the only one good for my skin and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuffs.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunetely, Feel It formula Acnee System has been out of stock for quite a while! I am desesperate to find it anywhere!!&lt;br /&gt;If someone knows where to buy it, please let me know!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Christian and I do believe in miracles! I had a face full of blemishes and acne.. I tried and wasted my money on quite a lot of products out there you can think of ...trying to clear my face. none worked till I stumble upon this at Walmart! ...long story short, it changed my life... still using it till this day!</li>
    <li> I buy this product regularly from my local beauty supply. I figured I try ordering online for the price break. I finally got around to using this product and it&#x27;s different. It smells different (worse) and it&#x27;s more watery then the same product that I get from my local beauty supply. The toner smells like straight witchhazel. The same toner from my local beauty supply has a fresh scent to it. Something is not right with this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister whom is a fan of this stuff. delivery was good but I can&#x27;t comment on the product itself so I assume it&#x27;s good because she loves to use it on her skin</li>
    <li> I have suffered from acne since I was 15 and I used every product on the market, nothing worked. This product has improved my skin so much, clearing spots and breakouts. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works great!</li>
    <li> I chose this because it cleared my face wonderfully. Took about two months. I began using last Feb(end of month) &amp; by the end of April I had prom &amp; didnt have to use foundation to cover my scars. &amp; everywhere I went, didnt have. They stopped carrying or never had it. &amp; I didnt even use it twice a day but I still got good results</li>
    <li> I am 44 years young and have been using this acne treatment system for about 3 years now and I absolutely love it!  Wanna know why?  Because it freakin works!!!  No joke!  I was a little skeptical at first, the &amp;#34;Miracle&amp;#34; part threw me for a loop....I instantly went into &amp;#34;Yea Right&amp;#34; mode.  Well &amp;#34;yea right is right!&amp;#34;  This is an awesome product.  I have tried every other brand u can name, they all bombed compared to Dr. Miracle&#x27;s.  I don&#x27;t know how this product holds up on non-ethnic skin types but I am African-American and it works well for me.  And it works FAST!  I use it enough to clear up my issues and I&#x27;m good.  But now after reading all of the other reviews about how their skin feels smoother and softer, I am going to start using it twice a day as a daily and nightly regime.  I have also used their GRO OIL serum and my natural hair went from teeny-tiny knots to mid-back length in about 11 months.  I don&#x27;t know who Dr. Miracle is but the products are the best!!!!! I WILL NOT use any other brand ever again.  Their prices are very competitive, but $20 is usually the price range.  Good Luck!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product the only thing that truly works to improve my face</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do really anything. My face looks the same!</li>
    <li> Ive been using it for 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin its clearer and softer -i would recommend this product for sensitive skin as well</li>
    <li> This has worked really good for my african american teenage daughter for the past couple of years, used many other acne products that didn&#x27;t work. Used to buy it in local Walmart and they no longer carry it, so I order it online.</li>
    <li> This is one of the only products that works for my acne prone skin. However, I feel like the formula has been changed a bit because it doesn&#x27;t feel as tingly as usual but regardless, with regular use, my skin is a lot clearer.</li>
    <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results. I think I was just expecting to much to fast. After about 2 weeks I noticed the difference and so did other&#x27;s. My skin is vibrant and healthy looking. I must say that it does dry the skin out so I add extra moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I saw this product at a beauty supply store and I have heard a couple of people who have been successful with using it, and so I wanted to check it out for myself. After three days of use I stopped using it because I was not seeing any results and I was still having breakouts. I&#x27;m going to try it out again and maybe after a week or so I will see changes.I do like the exfoliating cleanser it makes my face feel really clean so I&#x27;m not going to totally bash this product. Hopefully I am not disappointed again, but if I am. They will not get a nice review from me.</li>
    <li> My money was wasted purchasing this product. I would not recommend this product to anyone. There is no benefit of using castor oil on my face</li>
    <li> The first package of the bye bye acne feel it formula has expired since 2011. It&#x27;s so dissapointing that an expired package like that could be mailed. Unfortunately, i havent have the time to return it, But i will. Thanks.</li>
    <li> miracle is right. exactly what it is. best thing ive ever used. the results don&#x27;t stall like the others do after you&#x27;re use it for a while</li>
    <li> I suffer from black spots along side my cheek area on both sides of my face. Years ago, I saw a commercial for this product, and to this day, I AM STILL USING IT! I love the way it lightens up the dark spots, and gives my entire face a beautiful glow! I use it twice a day, everyday! It cleanse the face well also! I really would recommend this product to anyone that&#x27;s suffers from breakouts!</li>
    <li> This is is the only product I&#x27;m able to use on my face. I&#x27;ve tried Proactive, Neutrogena, Noxema, clean and clear, and some other products that claim to  be for African American skin and nothing works like this. My face cleared up in about 2 weeks of using this product and with daily use keeps my skin flawless.</li>
    <li> I purchased a set a couple of months ago and everything worked out so well I really like the product I could see a good change in my skin it is clearer.  The second set date had expired the dates were Feb 2012.  I emailed the company with no response.  It was just too good to be true.  I&#x27;m very disappointed:(</li>
    <li> The only product that works for my acne and back_acne. Proactive couldn&#x27;t even do the job.  I Strongly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product dried my skin out terribly. This product might be better for someone with a more oily skin type. But all in all it did nothing for my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I contacted Dr. Miracle&#x27;s several times about an order that was never fulfilled, just cancelled and refunded. I wanted to find out more information about a few other products but my inquiries went completely unanswered. Felt like they really didn&#x27;t care for my business, so I really don&#x27;t care to ever order from this company again.</li>
    <li> Great product, works for me !.</li>
</ol>
