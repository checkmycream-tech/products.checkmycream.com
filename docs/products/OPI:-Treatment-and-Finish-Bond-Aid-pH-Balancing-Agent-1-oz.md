<li> MAKES IT LAST TWICE AS LONG</li>
<li> Ordered the product thinking it would bond nail polish to my nails offering a long lasting wear to nail polish.</li>
<li> If you want your nail polish to last long, than get this product!</li>
<li> Use this before applying your base coat to make sure that your nails are super clean and ready to absorb the base coat.  </li>
<li> I think this makes a difference in how long my nail polish lasts.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this under regular nail polish to extend the life of my manicure.  I usually tend to ruin my nails within a day or two of applying nail polish and this helps extend it over a a week so I&#x27;m really happy about it.  It comes off easily.</li>
    <li> Ordered the product thinking it would bond nail polish to my nails offering a long lasting wear to nail polish. Instead my nails appear to be peelng.</li>
    <li> Use this every time I paint my nails using gel polish and they stay on for at least two weeks, love it I will definitely repurchase when I run out</li>
    <li> Bondaid is for Acrylic and gel nails. I is to ph balance the nail so product adheres. I have used this for years for acrylics and now gels and does exactly what is suppose to do.</li>
    <li> I do think this product really helps the polish application to last longer.  Anyhow,when I forget to prep my nails with it, it last shorter, so there you are!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s sticky when you put it on but it keeps your polish on for weeks.  Worth the extra drying time.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference as far as chipping or my nail polish staying on longer. I will continue to use it but will not purchase another one.</li>
    <li> I love my cute little bond-aid pot. I once forgot to put bond-aid on one hand when I was doing my gel nails, and that hand definitely started peeling first. The bond-aid hand stayed much longer!</li>
    <li> Love this brand but take soooo long to recieved😡😡</li>
    <li> I do my own Gel nails and they would always lift at the tip of my nail. Even after prepping really really well!!! I&#x27;m going on 4 days now and no signs of lifting at all!!! Mine always start lifting withing a day or even hours on a couple of my fingers! This stuff does the trick!!! I use sparingly just on the tips of my nails and it works perfectly!!! I HIGHLY recommend!!! I&#x27;m finally getting the ultimate wear out of my gel polish!!!</li>
    <li> Im impressed this stuff is worth the money.  Keeps regular &amp; gel polish on better.  Tried Gelish &amp; I prefer this brand plus its a big bottle.</li>
    <li> I received acetone. Nail polish remover. Wasn&#x27;t in the original wrapper. Very upset</li>
    <li> I use it before doing my shellac polish, and i think it helps to bond even better than the shellac already bonds. I Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> You MUST have a bond aid to do your gel nails if you want them to look good for a long time.  This product does what it should.</li>
    <li> Not sure how you can go wrong here. It worked just like it is supposed to. Just wish the UV light did.</li>
    <li> Used product under regular nail polish and the polish seemed to last longer. I have not not tried with gel polish yet but intend too.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my gel nail  polish to stick better.  It is supposed to last 2 weeks and I can only get it to last 5 days even with the OPI bond aid.  It does help but not as much as I thought it would.  I don&#x27;t even need to use remover to get the gel polish off.  It peels off within 5 days very easily.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and have trouble with my gel polish chipping due to hand sanitizer and frequent hand washing. This product has helped my polish to hold better to my nail. I use this with Shellac gel polish.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what all the ranting and raving is over this product.  Didn&#x27;t think much of it.  Gave it to a friend who is really into gel nails.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve had trouble getting your no-chip polish to stick, try this!  Also remember to use a nail cleanser before applying and again AFTER curing the top coat.  When removing polish, but your bowl of acetone inside a pan of hot water...the polish lifts right off after about a 10-minute soak.</li>
    <li> Thank you for the OPI Treatment &amp; Finish Bond-Aid. It arrived on time and was exactly as ordered. I like it.</li>
    <li> I decided to purchase this product after a professional manicurist used it under my nail polish on my natural nails. The polish lasted long without chipping. I use it now every time I polish my nails at home with the same results.</li>
    <li> It works great for my OPI Gel color it helps it adhere longer without some nasty smell! and its OPI the best there is!!</li>
    <li> Bond Aid is one of those &amp;#34;industry secrets&amp;#34; that differentiate a home &amp;#34;did it yourself&amp;#34; manicure from salon-quality results. This is suitable as a dehydrator on your natural nail bed before applying gel manicure base. Use sparingly: if you coat the entire nail the gel polish will be more difficult to soak off than if you left the edges uncoated (at your next salon gel mani appointment, watch how nail techs apply this very carefully to the base/center only of your nails).</li>
    <li> Makes polish stay on better but makes it harder to remove. I am impressed, it does what promised.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff works great!</li>
    <li> Good, quick service!!</li>
    <li> Not as good as Nailene&#x27;s primer or Sensationail&#x27;s, but it is much more accessible and does the job well. You get a fairly large bottle as well and it is not easily knocked over like the skinny Nailene bottles are.</li>
    <li> I bought it because I saw  it  manicure ladies use it in salon. It is a good product. Handy bottle with a brush.  I use gel nails and apply this one before I start applying all those layers.  polish stays on more then a week  without chipping off. ( I swim a lot and my hands a lot in the water).  So I am happy with my gel nails and I think this product  helps  to keep polish on longer.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, makes the nail enamel ast very long specially on the toes. I really reccomend it to every one</li>
    <li> This product came to me new as expected.</li>
    <li> Dont know if it keeps polish on better but i do think I see a difference in the longevity.</li>
    <li> Even with base coat and top coat, my nail polish always chips within a day. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference with this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really go wrong with OPI.  This product has well and truly met my expectations.  I used with with OPI gel colour and have not experienced any lifting or chipping whatsoever.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Made my gel lift after a few days, I have better results just wiping my nails down with rubbing alcohol. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Like saving my money easy to do at home!</li>
    <li> This is great product I use it before a gel manicure and a regular pedicure</li>
    <li> I would say this stuff works really great. I can definitely tell when I have forgotten to use it before my shellac manicure. It definitely prolongs my shellac!</li>
    <li> Not sure about its function.</li>
    <li> pH balancer for painting gel colors, works really well and goes on very easily.  Packaging OK, and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> Not really a lot to say. It works exactly how it&#x27;s supposed to, and lasts a really long time. I&#x27;ve never tried another brand, so I have nothing to compare it to. I can tell you the photo does not accurate portray how large of a bottle you will receive. It&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery &amp; nice product!</li>
    <li> Does what its supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Ladies/Friends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is best thing since SPANX.  I decided to learn how to apply gel nails myself and order gel polish and a gel lamp.  The lamp was defective, so now I had to send it back which means a delay in this project.  But I tried this OPI Bond Aid since hearing about it on the internet with just regular nail polish.  Well this is now the 5th day and there is no chipping or peeling.  I did also apply Sally Hansen Mega Shine and this also helps (apply the following day manicure).  I even washied dishes and still it looks good.  If you are one of those people who have reactions to acetone and so can&#x27;t have acrylic or gel nails applied.  This product will help.  PS make sure you pick a superior nail polish or nail lacquer, that also helps.  I will still wait for the lamp to do gel nails, but at least I have options if I don&#x27;t want to do gel nails.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  If you are a DIY person, then take the plunge.  Best wishes.</li>
    <li> I have tried this several times and my gel nails still pop off after a day or two.  It does not work for me.</li>
    <li> This is a Fabulous product.  My polish lasts 7-10 days without peeling. I would recommend it to anyone who does their own nails.</li>
    <li> I find no difference in using this product before I apply the gels, than when I don&#x27;t. Perhaps someone with different nail chemistry would find it useful. That&#x27;s why I gave it one star.</li>
    <li> I use this before I apply my base coat for my OPI Gelcolor and it seems to be working great to help my base coat adhere to my natural nail. I also use this before regular nail polish and it helps my regular polish last longer as well.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved this product and we would recommend it to everyone.  It works well!  We will purchase more down the road.</li>
    <li> Use this before applying your base coat to make sure that your nails are super clean and ready to absorb the base coat.  This is almost as crucial as the Base coat to making sure your Gel nails don&#x27;t peel off.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my husband before I apply gel polish.  This really makes the gel polish great and his gel polish stays on for more than 2 weeks.  I do not use this product as I am allergic to acrylic and cannot use this product.  But if I was not allergic I would use this product in a minute.</li>
    <li> NOT MUCH TO SAY EXCEPT THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO BOND THE POLISH TO YOUR NAILS MAKES IT LAST TWICE AS LONG</li>
    <li> ok for pre- gel nail applciation</li>
    <li> Yes, of course this product has exceeded the standards on mail bonding primer. I also receiving my opi bond aid within 2 days. Good product that lasts!</li>
    <li> Great product but then again it&#x27;s OPI and they take pride in putting out great products that nail technicians can use and recommend as well as a person that doesn&#x27;t professionally do nails. I&#x27;m a fan of the product.</li>
    <li> just what i need to do my  nails with  works great and love this item a whole lot would buy again</li>
    <li> This product is great....it truly helps the polish adhere to natural nails.  They look better longer...be sure to run a little on the tip and under the edge so seal the polish.</li>
    <li> OPI Bond Aid worked great on my natural nails.  My regular manicure lasted nearly a week when I used Bond Aid in conjunction with a top coat.</li>
    <li> All I can say is THE BOMB.  This product is the bomb!  I hate paying for manicures only to have them chip the same day or the next.  Seriously one of my pet peeves.  I took this with me when I had my last mani, and it lasted practically one week.  It works so well, my little girl still has polish remnants on her nails from a manicure she had over a month ago.  This products says it&#x27;s for gel manicures, but I researched it and you can use it with a regular manicure.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I think this makes a difference in how long my nail polish lasts.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as described, even if it is a little stinky. No peeling nail polish at all, even with heavy use</li>
    <li> I used this with some regular OPI polish and my manicure lasted a week. If your on the fence about trying Bond Aid, please purchase it!</li>
    <li> If you want your nail polish to last long, than get this product! The Bond Aid is very much a necessity for longer lasting polish. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended for use with applying gel nails and purchased it.  It seems to really help with the adhesion and they last longer. Pleased with purchase.</li>
    <li> its ok don&#x27;t really see a difference</li>
    <li> This really helps clean your nails prior to painting them with the gelish nail polish. I have forgotten to use this before and my color comes of much sooner.</li>
    <li> karen taylor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not seem to help at all Just made everything more runny and never seemed to dry</li>
    <li> The whole process went great!  I recieved the product within a few days of ordering it.  The packaging was good.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural nails.  It starts off my manicure with nails that hold the base coat great.</li>
