      <li>Love this hair product.  </li>
      <li>if you want to know more about my decisions on wax for hair.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great cream for getting that particular look or definition you want.</li>
      <li>It has a good hold and looks more natural than with gel.  </li>
      <li>It then should be easy to use.</li>

      <li>Not even a light sprinkling if water helped it.</li>
      <li>It does a fantastic job styling my hair and my hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad smelling, but really strong.</li>
      <li>decided to leave the rest of my original review below.</li>
      <li>First, you get a lot more in this tub -</li>
      <li>Third, it just seems to just work better for me and isn&#x27;t that what&#x27;s most important!</li>
      <li>this cream is amazing and while it give me the style I want it also keep the natural looks of my hair.</li>
      <li>or you use it sparingly throughout a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
      <li>You do not need to use much for most styles, depending on what type of style you&#x27;re going for.</li>
      <li>I have experienced that from other products.</li>
      <li>I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look.</li>
      <li>Great alternative to edge control for natural 5c hair and matte finish for natural hair line.</li>
      <li>The first thing you notice when you take the lid off is the fabulous smell.  </li>
      <li>Although this stuff is pretty thick and dries pretty quickly, a drop of water in your hands makes it &amp;#34;moldable&amp;#34; again although I rarely need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use American Crew Fiber often as I found it was the best out of many, many options</li>
      <li>Funny how the process changes over time!</li>
      <li>, I decided to try this on my son, whose hair is an extremely fine, straight grade of hair.</li>
      <li>This wax works great for users who don&#x27;t want a firm feel.</li>
      <li>Experiment and have fun,</li>
      <li>This works just as well as any of those, maybe even better since it&#x27;s non-greasy and looks natural.</li>
      <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this</li>
      <li>This is well worth your money.</li>
      <li>It stays on for a long time and has a nice scent to it.</li>
      <li>My husband recently had 10 inches cut off his hair and his new style is spiky so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this at a special to price to test for quality, I and my husband were thrilled.  </li>
      <li>With Keratin, Strong Hair Hold With A Super-Dry Natural Look, 85g (3 oz)</li>
      <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Second, (for my hair) the finish is more matte -</li>
      <li>Rub it into your palms or fingertips first before applying it.</li>
      <li>This hair cream is exactly what i needed.</li>
      <li>It took some digging out to get my first swipe of it.</li>
      <li>but I personally think the Defining Paste is awesome for matte, and forming cream if you want a little bit of shine (but it&#x27;s harder to work into your bone dry hair, and doesn&#x27;t smell as good).</li>
      <li>This comes in a large container.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Realizing I possibly may have hair that agrees with it, I decided to try this on my son, whose hair is an extremely fine, straight grade of hair.</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much to style your hair.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Got this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>It holds very well.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast, got it in 2 days, and gave it to my husband to try it.</li>
      <li>Remember not to grab too much.</li>
      <li>I will use it when I have absolutely nothing else to use.</li>
      <li>My hair is fairly light and lays flat without product in it.  </li>
      <li>The smell is good and subtle.</li>
      <li>I believe we have found his new hair cream!</li>
      <li>I used this on my son&#x27;s hair when he wanted a particular style.</li>
      <li>with other hair products I needed big amount to style my hair but with the D.J Professional Cream I only needed a tiny amount and my hair looks great!!!</li>
      <li>it kept his hair soft, not sticky or shiny, and it holds very well.</li>
      <li>So I think you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth from this.</li>
      <li>In fact, I used to log into Amazon and purchase/try a new hair product every week - I was on a mission.  </li>
      <li>It looks very natural, as if you used nothing at all.</li>
      <li>However, if a little bit doesn&#x27;t seem like enough for your particular hairstyle, then you can always grab some more.</li>
      <li>When you try to smooth it out in your hand to apply it, it just forms little wax balls.</li>
      <li>Who knows, maybe I am taking to much or not spreading it properly?</li>
      <li>I have bought the professional hair salon pomades and hair creams before.</li>
      <li>I blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair.</li>

    <li> Great product! I highly recommend it! It’s a great value for money!</li>
    <li> This hair cream is exactly what i needed. Makes the hair firm but looks natural and not sticky. The smell is good and subtle. The box is very big and i think it will be enough for a year or so. By far the best value for money in the category.</li>
    <li> I blow dry the hair in the front up, blow dry the rest totally dry, put some defining paste in my palm, rub my hands together vigorously and warm it up, and then work it into my hair. I love the way the defining paste smells, matte looks nice, and it&#x27;s super easy to get that messy but controlled look. I have slightly wavy hair, not stick straight or curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to leave the rest of my original review below. Funny how the process changes over time!

    <li> This comes in a large container. It was a lot larger than I was expecting. It works well. It is a little hard to get out because of its tackiness and hardness. However, you just push your finger in and scrape some up and you will have it. You do not need to use much for most styles, depending on what type of style you&#x27;re going for. I rub a little bit of this cream in between my fingertips and then rub it into the area of my hair that I want. It holds very well. I used this on my son&#x27;s hair when he wanted a particular style. It turned out quite well. This is not sticky or greasy at all. It also does not get stiff. It looks and feels natural. It has a nice scent for men. My son likes it a lot and he uses it most days. I used it a couple times too. The scent is not strong or noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how natural your hair looks after using this. It does not leave your hair shiny or greasy. It looks very natural, as if you used nothing at all. Remember not to grab too much. However, if a little bit doesn&#x27;t seem like enough for your particular hairstyle, then you can always grab some more. Rub it into your palms or fingertips first before applying it. I have bought the professional hair salon pomades and hair creams before. This works just as well as any of those, maybe even better since it&#x27;s non-greasy and looks natural. Furthermore, this package is a lot bigger than what you usually get in the hair salons. So I think you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth from this. I was so glad to be able to buy this product while they had a promotion going on. I think this is a great cream for getting that particular look or definition you want. They give you plenty of it too. This is well worth your money. In addition, it does not leave any white flakes in your hair. I have experienced that from other products. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps.  If this product is too solid or hard for you to use, just add a teaspoon of water and mix. You may want to let it sit with the water overnight to help soften it up. It then should be easy to use.u may want to let it sit with the water overnight to help soften it up.

    <li> Love the Product! Works exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it. Great value for price. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I received the DJ Professional Hair Design within 2 days of ordering it. The cream smells great! It came in a large container which I believe will be enough for a year or more (as you only need small amount to apply to hair). I have tried hundreds of products out there in order to shape my hair the way I want it, but nothing seems to work, A friend of mine came a cross this cream and recommended I should try it. I can&#x27;t be happier this cream is amazing and while it give me the style I want it also keep the natural looks of my hair. with other hair products I needed big amount to style my hair but with the D.J Professional Cream I only needed a tiny amount and my hair looks great!!! I can&#x27;t thank you enough for this product and I would highly recommend it to everyone who ever needed a good hair cream.</li>
    <li> Alright, I have had this tub of styling cream for a few days and think I have enough info now to give an adequate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, every time I read the reviews before receiving this jar, each one made it out to be some massive tub. Under no circumstance that I agree on that one. It is a decent size tub well enough but unless those folks are taking a pin drop size each time, not sure how you get this to last a full year. Either that or you use it sparingly throughout a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as the picture looks is how it arrives. The color of the cream depicted in the picture is spot on. Never having used a styling cream before I was not sure what exactly to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am mixed race and the types of cream I have ever used or seen have been a more gelatinous kind and hideous in color. This cream is thick but pliable. It took some digging out to get my first swipe of it. Spreading is not really an option. So it starts to spread, then it simple transfers a blob of cream from one side of your hand to another. Not even a light sprinkling if water helped it. In fact I watched water roll off it as if untouched. Who knows, maybe I am taking to much or not spreading it properly? Is this something to be spread in a palm or do you go at it once you have it in the hair. Normally I spread it between my palms and the glide small portions over sections that I want covered. This one left random clumps of cream in various places it broke off. I spent a few minutes trying to massage/brush/slide it into oblivion. Eventually it did work. Once it was in then I continued about my day. The cream, while always slightly thick and firm, never let its hold go. It&#x27;s several hours later and now my hair has gone back to being silky soft like prior to the cream. There is a slight thickly clumped feeling still there but not enough to enough and I am very grateful it done not dry white, such as regular hair gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realizing I possibly may have hair that agrees with it, I decided to try this on my son, whose hair is an extremely fine, straight grade of hair. It worked beautifully in his hair. Holding the random pose I created that morning before school. Everyone is right, it does have a pleasant mysky scent to it. I caught myself smelling my hands several times after washing them due to the lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good product, just know the type of hair you have and if it will actually work for you. For me, it did nothing but for my son it worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend? Yes.

    <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
    <li> So the size is bigger then what I expected. It stays on for a long time and has a nice scent to it. Big thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> Great product for styling your hair. It has a good hold and looks more natural than with gel.  Smells great and you also get a lot of product. You don&#x27;t need much to style your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the smell and works great for hair!!</li>
    <li> I have tried soooo many clays/waxes/other products that I wouldn&#x27;t even attempt to list them.  In fact, I used to log into Amazon and purchase/try a new hair product every week - I was on a mission.  It appears that my mission is over.  First, this stuff works great with my hair.  My hair is fairly light and lays flat without product in it.  After I get out of the shower I dry my hair, go about getting dressed, then return to the bathroom, rub a small amount in my hands and style.  Although this stuff is pretty thick and dries pretty quickly, a drop of water in your hands makes it &amp;#34;moldable&amp;#34; again although I rarely need to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use American Crew Fiber often as I found it was the best out of many, many options and while I liked it, I like this product more.  First, you get a lot more in this tub - it&#x27;s freakin&#x27; huge!  Second, (for my hair) the finish is more matte - it looks like I have nothing in my hair; American Crew Fiber had just a hint of &amp;#34;shininess&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34;.  Third, it just seems to just work better for me and isn&#x27;t that what&#x27;s most important!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product for my husband, he is obsessive about his hair and I started looking online to get him some better quality products. I decided to try this after reading the description, I liked that it is water based so I ordered it. Shipping was fast, got it in 2 days, and gave it to my husband to try it. He and I both loved the smell, and he was able to achieve some really nice looks! He took a very small amount, about the size of fingernail, and smoothed it through his hair, then created a couple of his favorite styles and they looked amazing! I like that it kept his hair soft, not sticky or shiny, and it holds very well. The instructions should be followed for the best results. A little truly goes a long way with this. My husband has thick wavy hair, and he only needed a pinky nail sized amount. Also, the wonderful smell won me over. Its a cross between a Chypre and Amber musk! 5 stars from me!</li>
    <li> This stuff is hard like wax, there is nothing &amp;#34;creamy&amp;#34; about it. When you try to smooth it out in your hand to apply it, it just forms little wax balls. You have to really work to get it in your hair without leaving little waxy clumps all over the place. And the scent... OMG is it strong. You can smell it several feet away. It&#x27;s not bad smelling, but really strong. I will use it when I have absolutely nothing else to use. I will not be buying this again. Lesson learned...</li>
    <li> Great alternative to edge control for natural 5c hair and matte finish for natural hair line. Long lasting no need to reapply, just resmooth and lay down hair overnight</li>
    <li> This wax works great for users who don&#x27;t want a firm feel. It definitely leaves the matted look as indicated, but the hold that it gives just isn&#x27;t there, and my hair is not long.  See my review for Dominate Salon Series Matte Waxx Hair Styling Wax With Keratin, Strong Hair Hold With A Super-Dry Natural Look, 85g (3 oz) if you want to know more about my decisions on wax for hair. I am not slamming this at all as &amp;#34;to each his/her own&amp;#34;, but for my taste, I like the firm feel of hair, which is why I go for the extra hold gel (ChampKom brand). Anyhow, this review is for this product.  It did what it indicated it will do, not a good size for heavy users, but still a good product.</li>
    <li> Love this hair product.  It does a fantastic job styling my hair and my hair looks shiny.  I also used it on my kids hair and it held up well.  Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> My husband recently had 10 inches cut off his hair and his new style is spiky so when I was given the opportunity to purchase this at a special to price to test for quality, I and my husband were thrilled.  He has tried a couple different hair gels, one that we paid quite a bit for from the salon but they did not style his hair like he wanted.  They also left his hair greasy looking and feeling and he was less than impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a huge amount of cream compared to the others we bought.  It is twice the size of the one we got at the salon and we paid more for the salon product.  The first thing you notice when you take the lid off is the fabulous smell.  The best way I can describe it is somewhat like musk.  The product is not greasy at all.  I actually rubbed some into my hands and it was totally absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was impressed at how little it took to style his hair.  He started out with product the size of a pea to do his initial spiking and used about half that amount afterwards to fine tune his look.  His hair looked like there wasn&#x27;t even product in it.  It was not shiny at all and his hair held the spike all night which included a lot of dancing.  I believe we have found his new hair cream!</li>
