      <li>I find this product to be very helpful with my symptoms &amp; have also ordered the 100% neem oil from Amazon to add to shower gel,etc.  </li>

      <li>There are not many products that combine neem with aloe, so i was really excited to receive it especially after i read the reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Used it on some dry spots on my legs in a week they were gone... Smelly but it works so it was and is worth it.. good stuff good price,</li>
    <li> Works great on my 8yr old daughter as it provides instant all day relief from her lifelong severe eczema itch. Amazing Neem leaf &amp; Aloe gel act as a natural antibiotic &amp; have anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, soothing &amp; cooling effects. We stumbled on this product at our local natural foods market 3 months ago. On our last visit they were out of stock. I was relieved &amp; surprised to find it on Amazon for a great deal!  I was delighted by the standard free shipping on orders over $25 &amp; the unbelievably speedy, well packaged, delivery two days after I ordered it!!  I recommend this amazing product by Organix South(THANK-YOU!) to anyone who suffers from severe itching especially babies/children who struggle with the nightmare of eczema itch. We seal it in with a good moisturizer(we use Alba unscented original body lotion). We&#x27;ve pretty much eliminated the harmful use of corticosteroids with the power of all natural products, foods &amp; vitamins.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face, hair, cuts, and any other skin area that needs healing. It&#x27;s has aloe vera gel and neem. Neem is a natural anti bacterial &amp; anti-fungal and the aloe vera is a natural healer. No other chemicals or harmful ingredients are added. It will heal a sunburn much quicker, too.</li>
    <li> I am a mature female who has developed areas of itchy skin, also itchy scalp, that have been very disturbing to my daily living activities .  I find this product to be very helpful with my symptoms &amp; have also ordered the 100% neem oil from Amazon to add to shower gel,etc.  I plan to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> Tends to clump/flake.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting the sting either when used as aftershave.  Have used Fruit of the Earth before and will likely order that brand after these bottles are gone.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin super soft.  Stinks though so I don&#x27;t use it all over.  It would probably be great for eczema prone skin but I cant speak for that since I do not have ezcema, just guessing</li>
    <li> My daughter and I have used aloe vera for years to treat sunburns or dry skin but after using this product my skin is so soft right down to my feet. I use it in my hair as well and it works like hair gel leaving hair soft and manageable. I highly recommend it. I just placed an order for 2 more bottles.</li>
    <li> I initially tried this product at my local health food store but they did not have any in stock, only the tester, but I was so impressed with how well it absorbed into the skin without being tacky, I went online to order it.  If you suffer from dry hands but find that lotion leaves your hands greasy and tacky (a problem if you work with paper in an office setting like me) then this is a good product for you.  When you first put it on it feels like thick Aloe Gel (which it does contain) and you think \\&quot;ick, this will never absorb\\&quot;, but it really does absorb quickly.  Although your hands feel smooth and soft like they have silicone on them, they aren&#x27;t tacky at all so you can touch things almost immediately.  It also has some natural antibiotic qualities because of the Neem Leaf so it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> it is a wonderfull effective neem product , it helped me clear out all pimple and dark spots on regular , along with theraneem soap and himalya neem capsules!</li>
    <li> I use it daily under my makeup and then again each night under moisturizer, GREAT product! I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Good product for after sun.  Not what I thought I was buying...I was thinking cream and the product is gel.  Can be sticky for regular daily use.  Does absorb in time.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. A little small goes a long way. Mix it with moisturizing cream and your skin will feel softer.</li>
    <li> This is very soothing and I can use on my body and face.  Using in the morning before lotion to even out tone.  Doesnt break me out or sting.  Would not necessarily call this moisturizing.</li>
    <li> so far no improvment in skin its done nothing  i was told it would make sensitive skin soft and smooth..  can&#x27;t tell it did anything...</li>
    <li> i use this on face (it&#x27;s lighter) &amp; lotion version on rest of body with added essential oils for insect repel. i also use the bar/liquid soaps &amp; therapy shampoo/conditioner too when i know i will be outside during warm months in florida- absolutely love these products.</li>
    <li> Applied this product once, or twice-a-day for three days, and skin problem was gone.  This product worked just as well when applied to skin irritation on my cat.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s great for some, but do a spot test before you use it.  This turned my face red in a matter of minutes and I look burned.  I guess I&#x27;m allergic to it unfortunately.  The seller was great though...very fast.  Too bad it didn&#x27;t work for me.  Now to deal with the red face... :(</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years now, and it makes my skin soft.</li>
    <li> Good gel for dry skin.  Very calming.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using this because she has very sensitive skin problem and it works wonderful on her skin and she have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff it works good come out from outside from being in the hot Sun I come in and put it on my face and my face it is so soft on my face thank you</li>
    <li> This product looks like it has really great ingredients, and it does if you only look at the first 7 or 8. There are not many products that combine neem with aloe, so i was really excited to receive it especially after i read the reviews. But unfortunately i did not research all of the ingredients until i felt a burning sensation on my eyelids when i first used it. One of the last ingredients is a chemical called phenoxyethanol.  The FDA warned that phenoxyethanol can cause shut down of the central nervous system, vomiting and contact dermatitis. -[...]    This is supposed to be a health product for skin, yet it contains a known poison/toxin/skin irritant in phenoxyethanol. That is completely unacceptable to me and amounts to false advertising when the product is packaged and promoted as an all natural health product yet it contains a synthetic poison. i am considering boycotting all products made by organix for engaging in such deceptive practices.</li>
    <li> Had it for two weeks. Used it on hair, skin, spots...no change. It does moisturize the skin I guess. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a good organic product that works well on sensitive skin and that works on sunburn...this product fit that!  It is cooling and works excellent.  I&#x27;ve successfully used this to aid in sunburn, which was cooling and soothing.  This is also a great product for heat rash and moisturizing.  I intend to purchase more!</li>
    <li> I gave it 3 stars because I prefer the Neem lotion much more then the gel. I have had Shingles of six month now and this lotion give me some relief. I have to say it does not cure the Shingles nor have any doctor cured them for me. I use it on my dry skin in the winter and it stop any redness and flaking of the skin. Great product.</li>
    <li> I have dry hands, and have trouble even touching some cloth (like microfiber) because my finger pads catch on it. I use this stuff in the morning after I wash up, and it goes on like a gel, then hits a point while it&#x27;s drying where it feels really sticky and you fill with despair, then it dries completely, forming a barrier that keeps things smooth and soft. There&#x27;s no smell to it after drying that I can sense. The bottle and pump dispenser are of good quality. It does not need to be refrigerated like some Aloe gels (and it does not claim to be 100% aloe).</li>
    <li> I have not used this product enough to know if it works for me. It appears to be very high quality, and I am predicting good results. Thank you for the reasonable price.</li>
    <li> It feels good on my skin but it stinks, so I have to combine it with other lotions to be able to tolerate it.</li>
    <li> Great product for itch dry skin.</li>
    <li> Fortunately I got this for my hair (gel) and not for my face or a baby&#x27;s skin, or I&#x27;d have to throw it out, since the bottle comes with no seal whatsoever and a bunch of it had spilled out, onto the bubble wrap and interior of the Amazon packaging. I called the company, got a very nice woman, who told me that no, they don&#x27;t put any kind of seal on the bottle. What&#x27;s up with that? I&#x27;ll give an update later about how it works on my hair, so nobody please jump my s*** about talking about packaging and not product, it&#x27;s all part of the same experience. It doesn&#x27;t make me think they care very much about their product.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product with many uses. I use it to heal acne scars quickly and to soothe other skin irritations. I also use is as a natural gel around the edges of my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> I have Follicular Eczema and was diagnosed last year. I purchased prescribed creams and after realizing the small tubes weren&#x27;t going to be sufficient for the areas all over my body...I had to seek something else. I researched and found neem oil was best for skin. I got this wonderful product a few days ago and I apply it after a bath and throughout the day. My skin never felt better. Gonna order more!</li>
    <li> This gel is nice for the body or the hair. I have curly hair and works great as a leave in gel, (does not have hold) hair will be soft and moisturized. On body feels cool and moisturizing, not sticky like some aloe gels...smell is plant like but can add a drop of an essential oil in your palm to mix when applying.</li>
