<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a difference in my skin. Seems to be much smoother and spots disappearing.</li>
    <li> The only thing this did was to turn my skin red and it was also raised up like a rash. Maybe my skin just doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this serum.  I really like it, it absorbs very quickly and is easy to apply all over the face. The texture is much different from Skinceuticals, which is what I was using before.  But, switched because I actually developed two small brown spots while using it.  So far, nothing new and I feel like they are starting to fade very gradually.</li>
    <li> Here is a great vit c serum to add to whatever skin care routine you are currently using. You take the dropper out and put anywhere from 1 to 3 drops and apply it liberally to your face and neck area. Somewhere else you can add it to is the back of your hands. It is a wives tale you can tell the age of a person by their neck and hands. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! So you doing this will help the anti aging to slow some. Plus bonus is your hands feel softer. I am using it on my feet too. It is winter time here and any extra help I can get to feel softer feet and hands in addition to my face and neck. I will do it.</li>
    <li> quite good not oily at all</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading other Amazon reviews. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work miracles but I had to know if it was as amazing as everyone else seemed to think it was. I&#x27;m here to testify, ya&#x27;ll. It is amazing stuff. I&#x27;m a freckly girl, 28 with a 2 year old, so I was hoping maybe it would get rid of the bags under my eyes and delay the onslaught of wrinkles I know are just around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, sadly it doesn&#x27;t cure sleep deprivation, but I started noticing my freckles had faded when I used it for only 2 days. I started putting some on my upper chest area that gets a lot of sun exposure, and sure enough the freckles there have all but disappeared. Once I realized that, I did an experiment and started using it on my freckly shoulders. Crazy enough, those are less freckled now too. I&#x27;m kind of weirded out but really excited. My freckles were sun damage, I wasn&#x27;t born with them.. so I&#x27;m really excited to get some of that... reversed? maybe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also should mention that I put this on at night after I wash my face, and in the morning after I wash my face, and my face looks really smooth and my complexion more even. I can tell if I forget to do it because it doesn&#x27;t look half as good. I highly recommend this stuff</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would see such a change in skin using this. Have used it for about a week.  It is great.</li>
    <li> no smell, glides on skin, absorbs quickly!</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> I have been using several brands of Vitamin C serums over the last several months.  In my opinion there is nothing more effective for reducing the signs of aging.  I have seen a huge difference my appearance.  The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth are much less obvious.  It as smoothed the creases in my forehead and even tightened the loose skin on my neck. This particular serum is my new favorite.  It is a bit more watery than my other serums which I didn&#x27;t think that I would like, however, when I applied it to my face it absorbed about 10x faster than my other products.  It has no scent that I noticed and I love how quickly my skin drank it up.  I have used this serum now for 2 days and am very impressed with how healthy and soft my skin is.  I look and feel younger. I was offered a chance to try this product during a promotion for trial and to share my experience.  This is my new Vitamin C serum of choice.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have only been using a little while but can already see an improvement....will be re-ordering......</li>
    <li> Organic Vitamin C Serum For Face 20% - Anti Aging Skin Care - Created With Vitamin C And E + Ferulic Acid + Vegan Hyaluronic Acid - Best Topical Vitamin C For Neck &amp; Decollete - Powerful Non GMO - Antioxidant - Like A Moisturizer - Developed To Reduce Fine Lines And Wrinkles, Fade Sun Spots And Skin Discoloration To Give You A Beautiful, Radiant Glow! Is a great product !! I recieved this product to test out as part of a promotion  and boy am I happy I did ! First I&#x27;m going to point out about the fact that this Product is GMO,Paraben ,phthalate ,Petrochemical,SulfateFree!! And no synthetic Dyes !! Never tested on anime and made in the USA ! And if that wasn&#x27;t enough they offer a full refund if you do not love it !! I&#x27;m in love w/ out even opening the bottle lol !! I mean how can you go wrong ? !! O k now on to my thoughts on the product itself :)  ! The packaging is nice I like the label design it&#x27;s crisp and clean ! I also like the bottle . Now for the actual product ! Ok I love everything ! The scent is great the texture is fantastic and I may be nuts but I feel it working it&#x27;s magic when it&#x27;s applied to my face ! I don&#x27;t have lots of wrinkles or dark spots but  these last few years has been very stressful and it&#x27;s taken a toll on my face ! Upon using this serum my face looks brighter and more alive ! I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments lately !  I highly recommend this product and this company  . I hope you find this review to be thurough and helpful !</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product a couple weeks, but I can already tell it has made a positive impact on my skin. It&#x27;s reduced some of the red blotches from previous pimples and seems to have made my face look healthier. I am hoping with continued use, it will make more of a dramatic change. I will be purchasing more of this product.</li>
    <li> Too strong &amp; burnt my face &amp; lips</li>
    <li> This serum works on my dark facial and hand spots, albeit slowly, and I believe helped to pull up a small deep acne cyst that had been on my face for years.</li>
    <li> I have no comaints. It&#x27;s a great product for the price. Though it is %75 organic instead of the assumed %100. I don&#x27;t think anyone with normal skin would have a complaint about this product.</li>
    <li> I have tried a few different vitamin C serum and haven&#x27;t seen the exact results I&#x27;ve been wanting. I have also wanted to try more organic products because  I think it would be better for my body. So when I was offered this Organic Vitamin C Serum from Candid Essentials for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I decided to give it a try. I have been using it for about a week now and my skin feels so nice! It&#x27;s soft and supple but firm at the same time. I also like that it has a dropper for easy application so you won&#x27;t waste a single drop. I like that it is instantly absorbed into my skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. If you are looking for a great Organic Vitamin C Serum, I definitely recommend this one from Candid Essentials!</li>
    <li> Goes on nice, rubs in and smooth&#x27;s right out.  I will be ordering more. This is the vegan one.. I wonder what the one from Snails feels like.</li>
    <li> I had questions regarding the product. They were very prompt and courteous in answering questions that&lt;br /&gt;I had. As for the product well I just started using it yesterday. I would have to check in later. But this product&lt;br /&gt;did smell exactly like other vit c serums I have tried. It didnt tingle like others though. Hope it works as good.</li>
    <li> The serum seems to be working well. Facial skin is incredibly soft and smooth. A few darkish pigmentation areas remain but perhaps in time will begin to fade more. Summer sun is always continuing to damage. Thanks for your interest and continuing communication about your product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a while now and it is the only thing that has really worked on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use many products but, this is so pure and clean that it does not harm me at all. I love how it has made my skin look clean and clear. The lines are slightly less visible and my skin has a healthy glow. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It works. I have very sensitive skin and now in the winter it gets even worse. After only a few weeks of using this serum my skin no longer looked dry and scaly. I am truly pleased at how effective it has been. I didn’t believe the hype until I tried it myself. Now all I do is recommend it to all my friends who complain about their skin.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My skin already looks smoother and brighter after just 2 weeks of use. I use it morning and night, using a small amount (about a third of the dropper).</li>
    <li> My skin feels like silk and fine lines aren&#x27;t there anymore.</li>
    <li> This worked great for adding to my creams and lotion. It is a very well made product. Will buy again!!!</li>
    <li> This is the first product (including prescription creams) that has made a difference in the age spots on my face.</li>
    <li> this is good for when you don&#x27;t have time to make your own... I recommend it ladies anytime, will be back for more...</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks now and I have seen significant improvement in the dark spots on my face caused by acne. I have also seen some improvements in my pore size. All in all the product is working great and I will continue to use to even more drastic results.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and must to be careful with what I use on my face.  This product is very hypoallergenic and does not irritate my skin.  I also see a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and notice a more supple look.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It took me about 4 weeks to see the difference. Now my face is smoother and less wrinkles. I will not be without this vitamin c serum. I am 58 years old and have been through cancer recently. My face was looking old and I was seeing more and more lines and wrinkles. So I started looking for alternatives. This is it for me.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE--I have  been using this for about a year now.  I still love this.  I have had acne prone skin all my life.  Used Proactive for years.  I now use this vitamin c serum along with the daily moisturizer.  That is all I use.  My skin looks so much better.  I have a few fine lines around my eyes and have had a deep wrinkle on my forehead that has greatly improved.  I do not believe in any type of botox or anything else like that for my face.  I like the natural stuff. Glad I found this.</li>
    <li> Could be just a wishful thinking, but after couple of weeks of using it, I&#x27;m receiving compliments how great my skin looks...</li>
    <li> Does go on nicely. Didn&#x27;t see huge result after about 30 days. May have to go back and try again though. It&#x27;s a shame it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
    <li> great service - effective product.  I am starting to see lines disappear !</li>
    <li> Great facial product!</li>
    <li> Works great! I noticed a change in my skin in less than  two weeks!</li>
    <li> I have been a face lotion user since back in the teenage days of using Proactiv. Fast forward a lot of years and in the last year or two my sun spots/freckles stopped going away in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after the shower, one thin coat per day, and in a month it helped my skin repair and get rid of my sun spots. It wasn&#x27;t an overnight thing, so you have to be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles to speak of, but from the perspective of making the skin look younger and free of spots, it definitely did that! Fully recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn&#x27;t a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing. I occasionally get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who appreciate my way of reviewing and ask if I&#x27;ll consider reviewing a product for them, with no obligation or cost. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.</li>
    <li> I will be honest, my wife is really picky when it comes to cosmetics. I&#x27;ve seen so much products thrown away and she barely used them. She never cared how much they cost, how much I had to pay for them etc. This a product that she researched carefully, she really wanted an organic skin care product that will do what it is supposed to do. Well, it seems like this vitamin C serum is actually working quite well for her, now she recommends it everywhere to all of her friends. And to be honest, when my wife is happy, I am happy. Go for it, you will not regret it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t worked so far.</li>
    <li> I am a bit disappointed: while it seems to refine my pores a little, I have not seen much change in lightening &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34;.  Will continue to use it to see whether time will make more of a difference.</li>
    <li> I bought the Organic vitamin C serum after a friend of mine recommended it to me. She knows I hate sunspots and have always used vitamin serums to keep them away. But it isn&#x27;t easy to find a good serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin so I have always been a fan of organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several brands of vitamin C serum, but each time I used them, my skin would start breaking out very badly. So when I first got the serum, I didn&#x27;t put a large amount of it. I tested it for a couple of days and my skin seem to take it rather well. No breakouts and my skin absorbed it easily. I have no idea if it&#x27;s because the serum is organic or due to the blend of ingredients used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most awesome part about the product is the hyaluronic acid. My skin tends to get dry easily. I can feel the tightness in my skin, especially when I wake up in the morning. After using this serum, my skin seems to be more supple in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this serum, I can throw away the hyaluronic acid toner that I used to have and cut down my daily facial routine.</li>
    <li> I like this organic serum and have been using it for 3 weeks! I like&lt;br /&gt;the consistency of skin tone uniformity, elasticity with firmness, not&lt;br /&gt;greasy. At the first two weeks, I applied the serum as base after cleansing, then apply&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer. Starting the 3rd week, I tried applying the serum the second time over&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer so it works like a shield ! I had fine lines in between eye-&lt;br /&gt;brows but they are even less noticeable !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using only organic products so I feel good about this serum. I am&lt;br /&gt;also patiently awaiting few age spots to fade! Overall, I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;organic serum vs. others non-organic ones. Keep up the great work&lt;br /&gt;Candid Essentials!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle. I had some discoloration after my pregancy, plus general uneven tone to my formerly procelain complexion (sigh). This worked in less than 2 weeks. My skin has never looked as good since my early 20s (I am in my late 30s). Worth it!</li>
    <li> Simple Vitamin C Serum is just what I have hoped for; it has great ingredients with great benefits that leave my skin extra smooth, sensitive and radiant. It keeps one very youthful and is easily and quickly absorbed in the skin. It is a recommendation from my wife and it feels awesome to obtain a product that fulfils its requirements as prescribed. I have recommended it to my friends who keep asking what is different with my skin.</li>
    <li> I find that using this serum around my mouth causes the area to break out in a rash. I only use this product on my forehead, nose and the top of my cheeks. It works fine on these areas.</li>
    <li> I got the impression that I need to use this product for more than a few weeks to see full benefit.  So far, I feel some sensation some days when I use it, which is in the AM and followed up with a moisturizer with SPF.  I&#x27;ll review again after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about three weeks now. I bought it because of very high rating on Amazon. It goes on smoothly and gets absorbed quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;I do see a difference in my skin but I also use one other product so not sure if both together are doing it. I definitely know that Candid has a made difference. I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have combinational acne prone skin and this hasn&#x27;t caused me to breakout..</li>
    <li> Very beneficial, Organic and safe, no side effects, works wonderful in our very dry climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very crucially important ingredient for skin - Vitamin  C.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s perfection! I love the consistency of this serum. It&#x27;s not greasy or &amp;#34;slimy&amp;#34; like some serums can be - it&#x27;s a very light, easily spreadable consistency that is received well by my skin. Maybe because this is made primarily of organic ingredients, but the smell is not horrendous either. I&#x27;ve had quite a few serums in the past never get further than the smell test because their scent and added fragrance was just too overwhelming. This has a mild, non-offensive scent that dissipates very quickly.  It also absorbs quickly! I&#x27;m not sitting around for 20 minutes waiting to put moisturizer on. I&#x27;m one week in and I am already seeing positive results in the texture of my skin and look forward to more long term results. As such, I&#x27;ll be updating my review after I finish my first month of daily usage, and then again at my three month and six month mark. But so far, I&#x27;m loving it!!</li>
    <li> Sorry! I am not going to say my age! but I love it! I haven&#x27;t feel my skin so soft in a long time! Definitely a good purchase.</li>
    <li> Nice Product... use as directed with a quality moisturizer. I Like the results and we all know looking good and feeling good at the same moment is unstoppable bliss : ) Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff!  Skin sucks it up!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the past three weeks and it is working quite well. It is firmly in my daily regimen and would recommend to anyone wishing to achieve clearer, smoother skin. My fine lines are receding and my skin feels soft and toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue using this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at what an instant result I got from this stuff. I feel like my face has tightened and is so much more clean and smooth,. This truly feels like vitamins for my face!</li>
    <li> I like this product. I have only been using for about a week - I was out of town when it arrived and took a little longer than expected to arrive.  But it is not sticky, has a light pleasant smell and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge difference yet, but like I said, it hasn&#x27;t been too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service has been amazing.  They have emailed me with tips, instructions and have followed up.  As long as I see some improvement, I am sure to purchase again.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve only used it a short time, but it really does seem to make a difference in my skin tone. I&#x27;m impressed.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I am one of those people who spends a lot of time outdoors and am not very nurturing to my skin until I reach a point where I look in the mirror and think...wow...I really need to do something here. I found this product because I was looking for something organic without nut oils and I am very pleased with the results. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and am truly noticing that my skin looks more smooth, the dark spots are less visible, and it has just filled in some of the rough spots....I am very pleased and am so inspired that I actually use it!</li>
    <li> So far I really like this. It absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling smooth. I&#x27;ll update as I use it more.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy skincare products, and I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I was looking for something to help with freshening up my skin a bit, because my face gets dry and feels quite &amp;#34;overused&amp;#34; when I wear makeup. This vitamin C product was perfect, my skin feels more elastic and smooth, plus I had some blemishes which seem to have disappeared. I have used every night for over a month and there is a difference.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the deal!  I purchased your product, but I am still using a similar product that I had purchased earlier, and I absolutely love it! After I finish the supply of the first product and start using yours, I would be happy to write a review for your product.  Can&#x27;t say, however, exactly when that will be -- possibly a few months from now.  I think I will love it!</li>
    <li> I love this serum. I felt it work just in one application. The redness of my acne spot disappeared. I use it daily and my skin feels quenched. It absorbs immediately and is light weight and totally non greasy.</li>
    <li> I am loving the product.  I use it morning and night, under the candid essentials moisturizer.  I can tell that its starting to take effect based on the complements Im getting.  People are noticing a difference that they cant quite put their finger on.  Im only three weeks into using it.... cant wait to see what the results will be after 2 months!</li>
    <li> Received and tried this right away.  At my age, I am always on the look out for healthy ways to improve my skin and help diminish those fine lines I hate. The serum is not oily or greasy and feels so smooth on my skin.  I don&#x27;t expect to looks 20 years younger and I am please with the results I see so far.  Thank you for the opportunity to try out this great product at a reduced price.  I&#x27;m grateful.  Keep making great ones like this!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve noticed in a short period of time minimized wrinkles. Especially on my neck. It&#x27;s scent free. I love that! It&#x27;s a good amount of product for the price and has a high amount of concentration. I use it morning and night and is making my skin younger looking, fresh and supple. The packaging is supreme and the dropper functions perfectly. It&#x27;s organic qualities put it a step above the rest.</li>
    <li> My skin looks amazing after only a few weeks of use. It&#x27;s clear and soft! I will continue purchasing this product for sure!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a couple weeks since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  My skin is softer and looks healthier.  I&#x27;m anxious to see what the next few weeks bring.</li>
    <li> I am not one for potions and creams and serums, usually. Not only do I have really sensitive skin, I find them to be uncomfortable and prone to react with my skin. As such, I was fairly hesitant to use this product initially, perhaps a little sceptical about its &#x27;organic&#x27; nature. It was only because it had come highly recommended by a friend that I did so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, thank goodness I did. After &#x27;borrowing (and finishing) my friend&#x27;s serum for the past few weeks, I have now purchased my own! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can honestly vouch for its impact which has been phenomenal. I feel great, there is a radiant look to my skin and it is pulsing with energy. I can&#x27;t stop smiling! I have been complimented frequently, but there is one thing that has pleased me more than anything. In particular it is the noticeable difference to a large wrinkle I have had for a long time along my forehead. Nothing I have previously used has made a difference, perhaps as it is so deep-rooted. I am very thankful that I have come across this and I highly recommend it. It has been a true game-changer for me! I&#x27;m a customer for life.</li>
    <li> If most of the 5 star reviews are from people who have only ever reviewed THIS PRODUCT ALONE, they are fakes. If this product really worked they wouldnt need to create a bunch of fake profiles and rate their own product. I wish there was a way Amazon could prevent this!</li>
    <li> Use with other serums for best results.  I could see a difference in just a couple weeks! Price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I really like the serum but it appeared the bottle was not full. Not sure of the reason for that.</li>
    <li> Worked okay for a Vitamin C serum.  Didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference though.</li>
    <li> Great product...will order again and again.  I am 58 yrs old and with or without makeup, no one ever knows...does wonders for your skin.</li>
    <li> After exfoliating my skin, I apply this product and within minutes I see the difference-- my face looks younger and smoother. I have a very sensitive skin, but this product does not irritate it at all. I also use Derma roller once a week. Vitamin C absorbs much better after derma roller treatment. I hope to eliminate the huge sun spot I have on my cheek. I will post again and give five stars if my sun spot fades away.</li>
    <li> NOT ENOUTH OF SERUM FOR PRICE THAT IS WHY MAYBE IT DONT GIVE THE RESULTS I M AFTER SO I WONT BUY IT AGAIN EMINENCE  HAVE BETTER  C more $ but at least  bottle is bigger and u can&#x27;t see the results so WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY BIG NO</li>
    <li> Great directions and tips - just need some time to determine how effective this product is</li>
    <li> An amazing inexpensive product that will help any skin be healthier. You don&#x27;t need to spend $80 on a skin cream to get results.</li>
    <li> Ok, I received a sample of this product to review and I&#x27;ll admit I was quite skeptical.  The product just seemed to be too good to be true.  However, after using this for a couple of weeks, I cannot believe the difference I am seeing!  My skin feels firmer and the lines around my eyes and in my forehead are far less noticeable.  The color of my skin appears more even - I always had a slightly darker area across my nose and upper cheeks but this area appears more even with the skin around it.  All I can say is WOW!  I&#x27;ve used face products in the past that made my skin feel tighter, but I always experienced very dry skin with those - that is NOT the case here.  Not only am I seeing the results in my appearance but the texture and tone of my face just feels so much better.  This is well worth the price - I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> i am truly satisfied with the vitamin C serum.  It has left my face very smooth and silky.  I am a 62 year old,and blessed with good skin, so the serum enhances my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions on my skin.  I have only been using this for two weeks and can&#x27;t state that any fine lines have improved yet so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars.  Maybe I can review the serum again in about another 4 weeks or so, I&#x27;m sure it will be positive, but I will buy this product again and the price is great!</li>
    <li> Using to treat rosacea and it seems to be working great. Also helps with complexion.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s been about three weeks of using this product, not enough time for any of the more dramatic changes. I have noticed a better texture to my skin overall from using this once a day (in the morning) after washing my face.  A little really does go a long way, the bottle is quite small but it just takes a few drops to rub into my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post a more detailed update in a few weeks.</li>
    <li> After extensive research online, I chose this product and love it. After a one-month trial period, I ordered enough for three more months and plan to continue. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! I have noticed a dramatic difference in my skin since I have been using this product. My skin is much softer, brighter and fine lines are no longer noticeable.My adult daughter is now using this also because of the results I have had with this product.</li>
    <li> Love this serum! I am 37 with fair, dry skin and this gives me a great glow. It has also faded some hormonal pigmentation along my forehead and upper lip. I use daily, love it. I have already recommended to friends! Great product, fast shipping. Will order again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 months and I really like it. It smells good and absorbs quickly. When I first ordered it, the order didn&#x27;t come with a dropper so it was a little difficult to apply. But I loved it so much and don&#x27;t want to ever run out, so I ordered 2 more bottles, and with the second shipment I received 2 droppers. If you order this and don&#x27;t get a dropper, let the seller know. My orders arrived very quickly and the product is great - it makes my skin glow!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Very good quality Vit C, with added vit E, ferulic acid and hyaluronic acid, and without anything noxious!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen any change after 2 1/2 months of use. Will keep using until second bottle is gone and then make a decision regarding any future use. Must say I am disappointed.</li>
    <li> Use this great product, has been the best way to be beauty without damage our planet, I love my organic serum, it is part of my  skin. 100% recommendable.</li>
    <li> I am on my second bottle of this serum and love it! Great product, which I purchase along with the face cream. Love that it&#x27;s organic and the company has been so nice. Great customer service. Definitely will buy both products again. Both products have always arrived perfectly bubble wrapped and sealed with no leakage. I am very OCD and would not accept anything not sealed perfectly tight.</li>
    <li> I do like this product and seem to be seeing more clarity, fresh look to my skin. I don&#x27;t feel I have been using it long enough to actually see the benefits of brown spot or wrinkle reduction, though. This is definitely a good product, though, and highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I very rarely write reviews but this one deserves taking the time to do so. I&#x27;ve only used this serum for about a week and the sagging under my eyes and around my mouth is gone. My spots are also almost gone. I&#x27;ve used all the expensive, highly rated products forever and never had anything work like this. I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> It seems to be making my skin appear smoother. Good product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this serum! Love the fact that it has vegan hyaluronic and organic ingredients! I am an Esthetician and have tried many brightening serums! This one is a winner!! Will for sure be recommending to my clients!!</li>
    <li> I really like this serum! I&#x27;ve applied it twice a day, for almost three weeks, and already happy with the results. My wrinkles are less visible, and my skin tone has improved. I also have very sensitive skin, so I was happy that the serum did not irritate, or dry my skin.</li>
    <li> I had really high expectations of this product since I love Vitamin C serums and this one caught my attention for being organic. However I am not sure if I can handle the smell, it is so rancid!!! To me, it smells like a mix between bacon and beef jerky! Yuks! I was wondering if anyone else has notice the horrible smell or if I might have gotten a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; one. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> This product did more for my skin than anything else that I have tried. It absorbs quickly and made a huge difference in evening out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I had to give this 5 stars. As a 52 year old woman I have tried many products and paid a lot of money for skin care products and this is by far the best especially for the price. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and people have already noticed the difference. I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about the benefits of Vitamin C and serums for skin lately, so when I was offered this organic serum for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion, I immediately thought of the benefits of it since I live in Hawaii and skin protection and care is very important to me . When I opened the bottle I already knew I would like it, no strong smells! Then when I applied to my face and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; it immediately absorbed leaving a tightening feeling and wasn&#x27;t greasy at all! I am very impressed with the quality of this serum and cant wait to see further improvements to my skin in a few weeks! And, did I mentioned ORGANIC? Yes, this is a winner !</li>
    <li> I think the product is exactly as described. Feels light and non-greasy.  I just wish the odor were a little more fragrant.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have enough Hyarulonic acid in it. I&#x27;ve used other brands that have more hyarulonic. You can tell by the viscosity. However, I will boost it by purchasing hyarulonic powder from Bulk Actives and add more to it. I highly recommend checking into Bulk Actives site!</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I love the way it feels. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles right now but I use it to prevent from them coming out. I can feel my skin tightening up once it&#x27;s on. I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Pleased with this serum.  Worth the price. Shipping was almost immediate, serum came fully and carefully packaged.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it&#x27;s working, but I like it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Kept the face skin moist throughout the night but didn&#x27;t notice any other benefits.</li>
    <li> Seems to dry my face.</li>
    <li> Brightens my skin!  Does not make my face feel sticky.  Wears well under make up. I have not noticed my spots fading but I will give it more time.  Great customer service!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about 2 weeks. It seems like some days my age spots are fading but then other days they look unchanged. I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> excellent addition to my organic skin care routine. my fine lines are diminishing, my skin is smooth and clear. have been being compliments on its youthful appearance</li>
    <li> Caution for fibromyalgia sufferers, does contain salysilates!</li>
    <li> I received this vitamin c serum as a gift from a close friend about a month ago. My friend is older and she swears by this so she purchased one for me for prevention. My skin is not near as bad as hers but I have to say I do feel a difference. At first it felt really tight and she told me to use a moisturizer because that&#x27;s what she does and it worked. Now my skin feels smoother and looks more even. I am so glad I got this!</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for about three weeks now and can already see and feel the results. My face feels softer and less dull. The hyaluronic acid seems to be working well because my face feels more hydrated since I started using this vitamin c serum. I apply the serum right before bed and use a light moisturizer. I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I love this product combined with the face cream..i have the worst case of pregnancy mask for about 11years now and this product has done me justice. I honestly thought obagi was the answer but it only made the situation worst. With many months of patience, I saw results and I&#x27;m thrilled I found the organic way of helping my skin to finally recuperate. I hope this product will do you as much justice as it did for me.</li>
    <li> Great product, very satisfied</li>
    <li> Still need to give this time - only used for 1 week - see vitamin E serum review too.  I think this will be a very good product to use.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this product.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> VERY happy with purchase! THANKS!</li>
    <li> I have been using Candid Essentials Organic Vitamin C Serum for about two months.  My face was definitely in need of some TLC after the summer sun.  I have noticed a big difference in the feel and look of my skin.  Obviously others have too.  On several occasions I have received compliments of how young I look and they tease my husband of &amp;#34;robbing the cradle&amp;#34;.  I use the Vitamin C each morning after I cleanse my face and then I apply my moisturizer.  I  am very impressed with the product and I plan to continue using it in the future.  I would definitely recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> the serum is easy to use, absorbs into my skin very quickly, and people are telling me left and right that my skin looks really good.  I use it twice a day- morning and evening</li>
    <li> excellent product.  Have been using approximately 4 weeks and can see a difference in skin /wrinkles</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I can already are see a difference in my skin.  I intend to continue using it.</li>
    <li> totally satisfied, 5 star</li>
    <li> Great price for Vitamin C Serum</li>
    <li> My skin is so much clearer using this daily and my skin seams a little tighter!</li>
    <li> I was given this product as a present and let me just say that it&#x27;s awesome. I feel my face a lot more hydrated and feels smooth to the touch. My pores look smaller as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have not seen any noticeable difference using Vitamin C Serum. I have been using the serum twice a day.</li>
    <li> I  Like that it absorb immediately. It goes fast, but I will try another bottle. Dr Oz recommended so I tried it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month, and i am loving it.  My skin just feels better!  I am only 29 but have started getting the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; between my brows, and I can tell that this serum is plumping my skin there.  I feel like my skin doesnt crease as bad in that area when I do squint because of the serum.  I have high hopes that with continued use I will start to see my skin brighten.  i will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Product absorbs quickly and leaves skin feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizer is then given a boost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Received on time and undamaged. I&#x27;ve only used this product for a short time, so I expect to see results over the next few months. Serum is light, not oily, and absorbs quickly. Huge plus is that it does NOT cause breakouts!!!!</li>
    <li> I am using Vitamin C Serum in conjunction with phytoceramides. These are the only products I have ever used for wrinkles that really work! I just used them every day &amp; saw some results in about a week. After 2 months, I now look approximately 10 years younger! I love that the Vitamin C Serum is organic, too. Thank you!</li>
    <li> My mother purchased this for my wife. She loves it! I can see the difference. It truly works. I might have to try it.</li>
    <li> loved it! worked wonderfully</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet. I bought it to try to get rid of my turkey neck. My neck and lower jaw are smooth as butter but I still have the wattle. I have noticed a decrease in my forehead crease.</li>
    <li> I love this product! The area under my eyes have been brightened and tightened! No more puffy under eye area. My skin looks healthier. Very happy to have found this product!</li>
    <li> Look up the ingredients in your most expensive skin care and then find out the main ingredients. All you need is this Vitamin C to heal and smooth your lines.</li>
    <li> This has been a terrific product.  My skin looks and feels better than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect to use this repeatedly in the future.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  It has really helped the tone and clearness of my face.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the serum long enough to say for sure that its serum that is doing the job by itself or if its in combination with the other products that I&#x27;m using as my morning and night regiment that compliments each other.  I do see a difference since starting the serum that wasn&#x27;t quite there prior to.  I do see a difference and do recommend this to others. I won&#x27;t ever get back the youthful - no wrinkles that I had when I was 18, but it does do as you have on the advertisement section of your product page with Amazon. I do feel the moisture being added to the skin and will continue to use it. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I have been using the serum for couple of weeks now and I see great results! Excellent products for face</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a short while, but so far, so good.  Other serums were too harsh for my skin, so I needed one that was hypoallergenic, and sans all the  chemicals you typically find in products like these.  Candid Essentials also seemed genuinely concerned that I was satisfied with their product and reached out to me to follow up.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for 2 months now. Some sun spots have vanished while a few others have faded. My pores are barely visible now which I did not expect. I will continue to use it. If you&#x27;re using this for wrinkles follow up with a really good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> It was more like water when you applied. I have not had any improvements on my face.</li>
    <li> Ive not used it very long, I think about 2 weeks, but I&#x27;m sure it has made a difference. It&#x27;s not a miracle or anything, but my 67 year old wrinkles appear not as deep and skin a little firmer.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  Have only had it a couple of weeks.  Will provide another update when bottle is empty. Looking forward to using it all gone!</li>
    <li> I like this product although I haven&#x27;t used it for very long. A little seems to go a long way.  My skin feels very soft and my overall complexion seem to be getting better.</li>
    <li> I have started using the serum for about two weeks now. I don&#x27;t see any results yet because it&#x27;s too early to see any changes. I do like my skin after applying the serum in the morning.  But the only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell, smoke fish. If I see good results, I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service.  Would purchase again!</li>
    <li> So far I really like the product.  I will need more time to know how well it is doing but my skin is looking good so I am optomistic!&lt;br /&gt;!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the serum, still waiting for the tiny wrinkles to disappear and hoping they do.  So far so good!&lt;br /&gt;Judie</li>
    <li> Candid graciously sent me their Organic Vitamin C Serum to test out for them and I have been using it now for about a month and so far I have had some great results!  I have tried several different brands of Vitamin C Serum and each one has been a little bit different in the other ingredients that they add to their Vitamin C Serum and in this case, Candid has added Hyaluronic Acid, Vitamin E and Feluric Acid.  The combination of all those ingredients makes for a powerful serum!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C Serums do not work instantly so it is not possible to comment on its efficacy at this time.  It seems to be OK.  I was surprised by the clear color since all other Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used in the past have been yellow.  I&#x27;m hoping for the best!  The product arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> This stuff is incredible.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.  The most amazing and unexpected result for me is that it has minimized the pores on my nose, which - all my life - have been larger than I like.  Not crazy large, but noticeable to me.  I didn&#x27;t even set out to try it on my nose, but sort of got in the habit of finishing off by dabbing the last of it onto my nose after I had hit the &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas.  Then one day I noticed the skin on my nose was noticeably clearer (less pink) and that&#x27;s when I realized the pores had tightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has made the rest of my face considerably smoother, it really is worth every penny.  And btw, my age is ... well, let&#x27;s just say if I were a calendar I&#x27;m up to at least August or September, but these drops have made my skin texture feel like spring time!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used pricey vitamin C treatments in the past, but am happy with this affordable and natural alternative. I&#x27;m 26 and want to prevent aging, but also have blemish-prone skin. Since the serum contains witch hazel, it helps keep my acne at bay while delivering the goodness of vitamin C. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Wow this has really cleared my face!! I loved it i have seen improvement these days and dont regret buying this. I would totally buy it again.</li>
    <li> Good product not the best! But it is ok</li>
    <li> Fabulous product! I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and the results are amazing!</li>
    <li> I have many products from the CANDID ESSENTIALS line. They are all organic and gentle; this Vitamin C serum is no exception. I started using Vitamin C serum a few months ago. I can see a difference in the appearance of my skin and I will not be without it. I use it twice daily, once in the morning and once at night.&lt;br /&gt;I have mild rosacea, hence I never wear blush and I use a foundation on my cheeks daily. After using Vitamin C serum there is a visible difference in my skin, the redness has subsided ( not disappeared); as the day goes on my skin keeps an even tone without getting redder throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;In the morning as soon as I am out of the shower I apply CANDID vitamin C serum to my face; just a dime sized amount to spread around my face and neck. After it dries ( minutes) I apply moisturizer. That&#x27;s it. Fast, easy, organic. What could be better? This has been working for me so I have no hesitation recommending this product to others. I am not claiming it to be a miracle in a bottle but it certainly has been working for me. I was offered the opportunity to test and try this product; I am very pleased with the results I am seeing and will continue to use this as part of my daily skin regimen.</li>
    <li> I love this organic product! I use this and then apply Ole Henriksen herbal day cream SPF.  At night I use Veris Dead Sea night cream.  I know everyone has different skin, but these products work great for me!  I highly recommend Candid Organic Vitamin Serum and it is a great price!</li>
    <li> This product work but it work slow I can see some different in my face. Will keep use it till the bottle is empty and will give you an update them.</li>
    <li> This serum is making my skin look better than anything else I have used.  I started using it about 3 weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve waited until I could tell if it was making any difference one way or another to decide if I wanted to keep using it or to look for something else once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that the dark spots on my face (I&#x27;ve had 3 very obvious ones that nothing else has helped) have faded almost completely away and my skin looks a lot smoother and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the wrinkles (crow&#x27;s feet) around my eyes were getting to the point where I could actually feel them when I touched that area of my face and again, not one thing I&#x27;ve tried helped at all.  Just yesterday I noticed that those are going away too.  I did not expect that to happen and was actually very surprised when I realized it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that this serum is working for me.  I am almost 50 and finding something that does what it claims to do is wonderful and in my experience also quite rare these days.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with how the serum feels on my face.I use it every morning</li>
    <li> This vitamin c serum is awesome. Infact i have regained my confidence since i had signs of aging. It&#x27;s indeed an anti aging serum. I started noticing change after a 3week continual usage. My face looks radiant, clear and youthful. Unfortunately i spilled it but am going to order my second bottle soon. Am happy with this product. Am 44 years but now look like am in my late 20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m male 70, have good skin, but that&#x27;s because I care for it with Murad for 40 years. The vitamin C at night is easy to use, apply for skin smoothness and some spots starting to fade away. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! My pores are disappearing and my skin looks almost flawless. I will keep this product as a staple!</li>
    <li> I love it makes my skin smooth</li>
    <li> This is great serum, works as good as the more expensive products I have bought in the past.</li>
    <li> Serum was too runny unlike others that were purchased at the local store;  there also was an unpleasant medicine/chemical like smell when it was applied on my face, neck &amp; hand.  I will not buy this in a future.  One aspect that made me a positive feeling:  an e mail received from the &amp;#34;Candid Essentials&amp;#34; - explaining an additional instruction as to how to store, apply &amp; what to expect.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Organic Vitamin C Serum on my face and neck for awhile now and I am really impressed with it. I use it once a day and it is so nice and cool to apply. It goes on smoothly and I let it dry before I apply moisturizer. I believe my face looks clearer, softer and smoother than before I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum contains the most effective form of Vitamin C available, a number of vitamins and also plant antioxidants. It is all natural and organic and does not have preservatives. The serum comes with a dropper which I really like rather than some of the other serums that use a squirt type system that goes all over the place. I was asked to test and review this item and give my honest opinion of it. I highly recommend this fantastic Vitamin C serum that would like to try an organic Vitamin C serum to help decrease the aging effect. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is the best, it is absorbed by the skin quickly giving you a youth glow and soft skin.  You actually feel like you are feeding your skin full of nutrients. By the 3rd week, fine lines are gone, there is more elasticity and pores look a lot smaller. I am 50+ years old I purchase this product a a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
