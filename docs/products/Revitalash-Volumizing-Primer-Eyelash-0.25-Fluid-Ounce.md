      <li>I love this mascara.</li>
      <li>There have been a lot of products that claim to create longer more fuller lashes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Either way, I love it just for the priming factor.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love this eyelash primer.</li>

      <li>This won&#x27;t do much on its own.</li>
      <li>Works great in conjunction with Revitalash eyelash conditioner, if you&#x27;re wearing mascara regularly.  </li>
      <li>But with this formula, followed by my mascara, it gives a nice rich look without too much work to avoid clumping, etc.  </li>
      <li>I have long lashes but like to give them some volume and this works great under any of my mascaras.</li>
      <li>When this went on a Lightening Special, I was all over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really does work, I will always order more.</li>
      <li>True Revitalash eyelash conditioner products do work.  </li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t make them longer but looks good after I apply regular mascara.</li>
      <li>It definitely does a good job giving my lashes a longer, fuller look when applied.  </li>
      <li>I have used other primers with great success</li>

      <li>/&gt;Not sure about at full price, but on a special, I definitely recommend this product!  </li>
      <li>It goes on so smoothly and really takes the length and volume of your lashes to another level that I don&#x27;t even need to put mascara on after.</li>
      <li>Smile.</li>
      <li>but well worth it if you&#x27;re in the market for an eyelash primer.</li>
      <li>Just my 2 cents worth.  </li>
      <li>Hard to find good primer!</li>
      <li>I used it right away</li>
      <li>They make it so easy when life gets too busy</li>
      <li>Also the deep blue color is great and every now</li>
      <li>VERY FAST SHIPMENT.  </li>
      <li>VERY REASONABLE PRICE.  </li>
      <li>I actually prefer the Revitalash over most of the high-end varieties.  </li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>Urban Decay is 1000 times better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and have not found a better product out there.  </li>
      <li>and it works really well!</li>
      <li>I just ordered another eyelash primer with the white color and it is ok.</li>
      <li>This is my second order and I&#x27;m pleased with the results since my purchase 3 mos.</li>
      <li>Like a Mary Kay mascara I had years ago, Limited Edition, if I remember correctly, in blue and purple lol.</li>
      <li>The primer is bright blue which is odd, and my mascara seems to come off easily when I</li>
      <li>I will never buy the other kind again.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love how long it makes them look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nothing that was quite as effective but some worked well with consistent use, just took a little longer and not quite as much results but</li>
      <li>Really primes and lengthens my lashes ready for mascara</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really see that it is Navy.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works.</li>
      <li>Really helps to keep mascara in place, no running etc.  </li>
      <li>Haha.</li>
      <li>I really like the product.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>and it also volumizes really well because of your ability to see where you have placed it.  </li>
      <li>Have found other products that produce better results.</li>
      <li>would recommend this highly.</li>
      <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHRISTOPHER TRADING CO.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month or so now and will be buying more in the future.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am happy to report that I was wrong.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how long and full my lashes had gotten.</li>
      <li>I definitely notice a difference when I am in a rush and don&#x27;t use this primer first.</li>
      <li>I use is under mascara, and sometimes alone for a natural but enhanced look.  </li>
      <li>and this stuff really gives my lashes a BIG boost.  </li>
      <li>far, I am not seeing a change in my lash length.  </li>
      <li>It comes out blue, but the color really allows you to see where it is-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> All Revitalash products that I have used are very good. They actually do as promised.</li>
    <li> Very good primer--recommend buying this product!</li>
    <li> I bought it to use under my mascara cause I have short lashes. This product doesn&#x27;t make them longer but looks good after I apply regular mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It has this weird blue color on the wand, but if your lashes aren&#x27;t blond or gray, it does not appear blue when applied. Best part: no raccoon eyes! It&#x27;s the only mascara type product that both makes my lashes look darker and fuller, and doesn&#x27;t smudge or flake. Will reorder.</li>
    <li> There have been a lot of products that claim to create longer more fuller lashes. Revitalash lives up to it&#x27;s claims. The primer is easy to use.</li>
    <li> I like the blue color this comes in - it makes it easy to see what I hit and what I missed!  I&#x27;m not convinced this really adds the volume I would like - but perhaps my expectations are unrealistic.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again.  I have dark lashes, so the blue doesn&#x27;t show on me--it may on others.  I use is under mascara, and sometimes alone for a natural but enhanced look.  I curl them after I apply, and it seems to help hold the curl.</li>
    <li> No improvement in eye lashes</li>
    <li> I love this primer, it goes on bright blue but darkens as it dries. I put on the revitalash mascara after the primer dries and there is no clumping; my eyelashes look better then they ever have.</li>
    <li> I have used other primers with great success so I tried this one based on the quality of the company&#x27;s Revitabrow. Big mistake. Aside from the lovely color it is useless.</li>
    <li> This is my second order and I&#x27;m pleased with the results since my purchase 3 mos. ago. Lashes are stronger and the blue color is easier to cover since my lashes are brown.</li>
    <li> This is a below average eyelash primer.  Urban Decay is 1000 times better.  It&#x27;s called Subversion and it really works!</li>
    <li> seems it bulks up some , but it was ok , no problem with sellor</li>
    <li> This really does work, I will always order more.</li>
    <li> It DOES stay BLUE, it DOES NOT dry clear. It takes several layers of mascara to fully cover the blue at the root of your lash. Personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for the price.</li>
    <li> Love this primer.  Really helps to keep mascara in place, no running etc.  Very good if you have sensitive eyes as I do.</li>
    <li> Love the way this goes on, feels on my lashes, and the base it creates for my mascara.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a month or so now and will be buying more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on Electric Blue! Like a Mary Kay mascara I had years ago, Limited Edition, if I remember correctly, in blue and purple lol. Loved that stuff!  My husband loves the look, when I wear this, before getting my regular mascara on over it (which completely covers the blue).  Fun color, looks kind of like blue shadow fallen onto the lashes, he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Latisse, a few years ago, and since I did not keep up with it, the results faded of course.  Since then, I have used some inexpensive growth serums I have seen now and again on NoMoreRack (good prices). Nothing that was quite as effective but some worked well with consistent use, just took a little longer and not quite as much results but still some... When this went on a Lightening Special, I was all over it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, I am not seeing a change in my lash length.  I did read a review that stated this only works when used in combination with the brand&#x27;s second product, for moisturizing the lashes.  I have not tried that and likely will not. I do keep my lashes moisturized with oils though, sometimes at night and always prior to using this when I wear make-up.  Since I have not used this daily, that may contribute to my not having the results that are supposed to come with it...  I will update in another month or so if I do see a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I love it just for the priming factor.  It definitely does a good job giving my lashes a longer, fuller look when applied.  I do not normally layer a whole lot of mascara on because I do not care for the look.  But with this formula, followed by my mascara, it gives a nice rich look without too much work to avoid clumping, etc.  Easy glide and my mascara lasts nicely all day, without needing a touch-up at the base if I am going to dinner (as I did prior to using this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about at full price, but on a special, I definitely recommend this product!  Hope this helps.  Smile.s I did prior to using this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure about at full price, but on a special, I definitely recommend this product!  Hope this helps.  Smile.</li>
    <li> Best lash primer I&#x27;ve ever used. I wish it were a little less money but well worth it if you&#x27;re in the market for an eyelash primer. It goes on so smoothly and really takes the length and volume of your lashes to another level that I don&#x27;t even need to put mascara on after. I notice that my lashes seem healthier wearing this under mascara and less lashes fall out when washing off.  I definitely notice a difference when I am in a rush and don&#x27;t use this primer first. The mascara doesn&#x27;t stay on as long and tends to get a little clumpy with multiple coats which aren&#x27;t needed when the primer is used first. Also the deep blue color is great and every now and then I will miss a lash and people will compliment with slight hint of navy blue in my lashes. Haha.</li>
    <li> I had not expected the primer to come in blue shade.  However, I applied it and then I topped it with my black mascara and it llooks quite well.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash primer. I have long lashes but like to give them some volume and this works great under any of my mascaras.</li>
    <li> wouldn&#x27;t go without now that I have been using it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had great success with this product.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how long and full my lashes had gotten. and I maintained them that way for months.  I was very pleased.  However, the product is undoubtedly expensive though, so I thought I&#x27;d try a less expensive product.  In no time, my lashes were back to short,  stubby and very unexciting.  I&#x27;m back to Revitalash.  It is expensive though and doesn&#x27;t last very long, hence the four stars.</li>
    <li> IN PERFECT CONDITION.  VERY REASONABLE PRICE.  AMAZING PRODUCT.  VERY FAST SHIPMENT.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND CHRISTOPHER TRADING CO. LLC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I USE THIS PRODUCT EVERYDAY UNDER MY MASCARA AND MY LASHES HAVE DOUBLED IN LENGTH!</li>
    <li> Works great in conjunction with Revitalash eyelash conditioner, if you&#x27;re wearing mascara regularly.  However, it doesn&#x27;t work wonders just by itself.  Do not confuse Nouriche eyelash conditioner with Revitalash eyelash conditioners.  Nouriche does not work.  True Revitalash eyelash conditioner products do work.  But, there are marketing ploys to try and tie Nouriche to the Revitalash name.  Don&#x27;t fall for Nouriche.  But, using Revitalash eyelash conditioner with this eyelash primer will give you very good results.  Just my 2 cents worth.  I&#x27;ve used them all.  This won&#x27;t do much on its own.</li>
    <li> I just ordered another eyelash primer with the white color and it is ok. I am sorry I didn&#x27;t order this one again. I love it. The problem with the one I just ordered(not through Amazon) clumps a lot and it also looks funky on the eyelashes but this one is just wonderful. No clumping at all. I can wear this alone without mascara over it and it looks great. You can&#x27;t really see that it is Navy. Makes my eyelashes stand out even more. The other one does not do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this highly. I will never buy the other kind again. Only this one.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product and quit using it because I found it to &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; and I would later have little clumps of mascara under my eyes throughout the day. I ended up purchasing Lancome&#x27;s Cil booster primer. I usually use Lancome, decided to buy this because it was cheaper, and ended up going back to what I always use because it works much better. I would not recommend this product as the quality for me was not satisfactory.</li>
    <li> I was kind of freaked out when I opened this and it was a funky blue color!  Either I did not read description carefully, or it was not stated that it&#x27;s blue.  Makes no difference, however.  I use this under my Definicils mascara.  The blue color does not show through.  It makes my lashes more defined and separated.  It does not flake or smudge.  I&#x27;m not sure if it makes them fuller or longer, but they do look much nicer through the whole day.  This adds a few minutes to your morning routine - as would any primer, because you have to put it on and let it dry before you put your mascara on.  If you&#x27;re looking to enhance your mascara and lashes, you will probably like this product for the price.</li>
    <li> I regret buying this. It&#x27;s clumpy, ugly and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my eyelashes. And it was way expensive.</li>
    <li> This was not the product I thought I was ordering that I had used previously but it appears to work just as well and I really like it.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s blue. It&#x27;s primer... what do you expect? I love that it makes my mascara stay &amp; not smear &amp; I love how long it makes them look.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using it for a few days now, but hoping that it will continue to make my lashes grow like other revitalash products. Can&#x27;t beat the sale price of $18! Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Really primes and lengthens my lashes ready for mascara</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry but it made me sick and I got a really bad headache when I got it I used it right away so therefore I have not used it since!!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff - you can even use it doing the day time all by itself</li>
    <li> The best lash primer ever.</li>
    <li> Great primer! It helps my lashes look thicker and longer along with my mascara.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it instead of mascara.</li>
    <li> The primer is bright blue which is odd, and my mascara seems to come off easily when I where it. I do not like this product.</li>
    <li> Great primer, it makes your lashes look thicker &amp; longer. You can follow it with revitalash mascara or a waterproof one like I do sometimes. It&#x27;s wonderful, it makes taking off the waterproof mascara with a makeup removing cloth much easier than with no primer.</li>
    <li> I feel if you are going to get the mascara you should also get this.  Great product.  I have been an aesthetician for 20 years and this is a great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this stuff, I have NO eyelashes and this stuff really gives my lashes a BIG boost.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years now and have not found a better product out there.  It also has great ingredients for people who are sensitive like myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in the misleading pricing of this product.  A google search reveals it&#x27;s sold for an average price of 24 dollars, not 60</li>
    <li> this is unacceptable.  I have used eyelash primer before, but what I received, even tho a tiny white sticker says &amp;#34;eyelash primer&amp;#34;, is actuals, when opened, a BROW growth enhancer.  Its white and had only a dauber to apply; not a wand.  I am attempting to return but currently have a crashed printer and am unable to print a return label.  Totally unacceptable from Amazon.  I have seen this brow enhancer used by cancer victims who are undergoing chemo and hoping to enhance brow growth.  What a hassle.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dream of putting mascara on without this primer..</li>
    <li> Love it! It is great &amp; worth the money. Hard to find good primer! I will buy again when needed.</li>
    <li> I have used several other lash primers, including some very high-end brands.  I actually prefer the Revitalash over most of the high-end varieties.  It comes out blue, but the color really allows you to see where it is- and it also volumizes really well because of your ability to see where you have placed it.  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> I really like the product.  I purchased this with mascara expresso and it&#x27;s working well.  I will purchase again soon</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE the primer and am a huge Amazon Prime fan!! They make it so easy when life gets too busy</li>
    <li> I am not 100% sure that this primer made my eyelashes look more voluminous.  I am still trying it out with other mascaras I have before I endorse it.  The blue color is a little unusual for a primer.</li>
    <li> Have found other products that produce better results.</li>
    <li> Great for your lashes that makes them look fuller and not clumpy ! Works with any mascara! It&#x27;s very blue but I use it with a black mascara and it works really well!</li>
    <li> I did not like the blue coloring, but it did what it s aid it would do.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. Don&#x27;t let the blue color fool you. Lashes will look thicker and longer.</li>
    <li> Primes your lashes and separates lashes well.  Mascara does not flake or smudge!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it and order it again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lancôme&#x27;s Cils Booster for years and never thought I&#x27;d find another mascara base I like as much. I am happy to report that I was wrong. Revitalash exceeded my expectations and I like it better than Cils Booster. Very happy to have found it.</li>
