    <li> Some&lt;br /&gt;Of tools have much to be desired!! The teasers don&#x27;t even work to grab hairs!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves her pink set. she likes that it has a smile face on the hardware.</li>
    <li> I like the color and quality of items.  The closure is practical.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect travel and at home set. All arranged nicely in its pretty pink case. Nothing moves so it wont get lost and all stays nice and organized. I love it</li>
    <li> Its a little cheaply made but for the price its good I guess. It still looks cute and came with a lot of stuff. I dont even know what most of it is for! Saves me money on weekly mani/pedis.</li>
    <li> Such a cute set! The tools are great quality and are perfect for manis/pedis.</li>
    <li> Very nice presentation. Love the croco look and the feminine pink color. Perfect size for travel. Hope my niece likes it.</li>
    <li> What is shown and listed comes in this set. True to color. I got this for myself since I am needing a new on and I am in love with it. This is also a good gift idea too.</li>
    <li> This set is a gift for my preteen niece.  She has lovely hands and a sense of style.  The set provided a wide variety of colors.</li>
    <li> This was a great gift for a preteen 12 years who is just starting to take a different lok at herself.  There were plenty of tools to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do your finger and toenails.  She was delighted with the gift with a few  nail polishes and polish remover.  The reason I gave it a four was I thought the case looked a little cheap.  Otherwise it was great.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> This is very cute, and also nicely made. It is somewhere between the very expensive thick stainless steel, but certainly far from the flimsy kits that break. I love this kit.</li>

    <li> Gift for a 13 year old girl- she loves it and has spent hours doing her nails.  Good quality</li>
    <li> Bad quality... Poor customer service...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and effective!</li>
    <li> Everything that comes in it is great but it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations as far as how it was made. Poorly stitched and wasn&#x27;t aligned decently. It also was larger than expected but I shud have read the description, I wanted to return it but I just set it aside and forgot about it.</li>
    <li> The outside is a glossy pink vegan leather and when you open it up you get a great assortment of tools for everyday grooming. And the tools are not just for your nails; some tools can be used to clean your ears (ear pick) or tweeze stray hairs (tweezers) etc. If you would use all 11 pieces this kit has then I would say it&#x27;s probably worth it, however there are a lot of issues I have with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Convenient&lt;br /&gt;-Cute&lt;br /&gt;-Useful (for the most part)&lt;br /&gt;-Will fit in to most purses&lt;br /&gt;-Most tools work the way they&#x27;re supposed to&lt;br /&gt;-Nail cutter cuts nails (had several other nail cutters where they would just bend the nail if they&#x27;re cheaply made)&lt;br /&gt;-Scissors cut pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Kind of bulky&lt;br /&gt;-Tools usually fall out (I&#x27;ve lost several around the house)&lt;br /&gt;-Cuticle cutter feels really cheap with the pink plastic handles and the blades are not really aligned properly so it&#x27;s hard to get a good cut and usually just leaves my cuticles mangled.

    <li> This is very cute. The wallet is decently made. The tools aren&#x27;t the highest quality but they&#x27;re functional. This is a good gift for a teenage girl.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my seven year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it.</li>
