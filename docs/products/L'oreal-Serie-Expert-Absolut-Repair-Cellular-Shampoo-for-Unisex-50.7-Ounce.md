      <li>First bought this product from my salon and loved it.</li>
      <li>Made hair smell nice, really gives body and shine (unlike cheaper products that claim it does!</li>
      <li>The product makes my hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>it isnt sulfate free</li>
      <li>Leaves hair soft, is non-drying, and good for color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>, I prefer going to the store and smell it and feel the texture of it, this way I would be sure that it is not a fake one...</li>
      <li>(did not look like it was clean at all, no shine)</li>
      <li>This did not even clean my hair.  </li>
      <li>I searched Amazon to find better price and found it with the benefit of the large bottle.</li>
      <li>Love it so much that i bought it as Christmas gifts for family members this year.</li>
      <li>You barely need hair conditioners, a good leave-in is already enough to make your hair shine :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tested many others, but none makes my hair so soft after using like this one.</li>
      <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
      <li>Ok, so you spend a little more...</li>
      <li>I alternate between the blonde shampoo and this one to keep my blonde beautiful, shiny and healthy.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and this shampoo leaves my hair soft and smooth, with no freeze.</li>
      <li>reasonable price!</li>
      <li>Good shampoo good size very expensive for the job.</li>
      <li>This is a far better way to purchase.it is becoming more and more difficult to find this professional size packaging.</li>
      <li>This size with the pump which you need to buy as an extra if you don&#x27;t have one is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Love,love,love this shampoo,especially for bleached blond very damaged hair.  </li>
      <li>My kids use it and it helps prevent too much shampoo coming out at once.  </li>
      <li>I have problem hair, dry climate, hypothyroidism, makes hair brittle, easily breaks off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before and loved it, that is why I bought a large one at this time, but, after washing my hair with it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair was weird like I&#x27;ve never felt it this way before</li>
      <li>and I had to immediately go out and buy new shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to find some of them available in professional sizes which makes the items less expensive per ounce.</li>
      <li>Save your old bottles with pumps if you plan on buying this!</li>
      <li>great shampoo from loreal, cant go wrong leaves hair light fluffy and soft,</li>
      <li>It leaves hair really soft and helps strengthen damaged hair.</li>
      <li>It left a very greasy residue</li>
      <li>This is a greaaaat product if your hair is damaged, waaay better than Kerastase,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s expensive but defiantly worth it.</li>
      <li>Products used to be sold only in high end beauty salons are now in pharmacies but in smaller sizes.</li>
      <li>This is professional grade shampoo which is a little more expensive, but worth the extra money.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t save my previous smaller bottles that had pumps attached because I didn&#x27;t know I would be buying this large value size.  </li>
      <li>With this large size of a bottle, it&#x27;s super difficult to untwist the cap and pour into hands while in the shower every.single.time.  </li>

<li> Combined used with the coordinating conditioner this product retains hair coloring better than other expensive shampoos/conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
<li> , it is strange to say it, but looks like there glue inside of this bottle (when I was drying my hair, I had to wash my hands three to four times because it was sticking, I can&#x27;t explain..</li>
<li> I am going to have to buy a smaller empty container with a pump now.  </li>
<li> Buy the largest bottle for a long use, or spread it around the house.  </li>
<li> Usually my hair feels soft and silky after I use it.</li>
<li> Our favorite L&#x27;oreal products are usually very expensive.</li>
<li> this is the first time that I bought something from amazon.com and I am not happy with my purchase.</li>
<li> Just as I expected.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even imagine switching for any other shampoo.</li>
<li> Cuts down on waste !</li>
<li> I usually buy it at my salon for $30, for about half of the size.  </li>
<li> But I wanted to save some money and buy it online because it is expensive.</li>
<li> But after I use this one, my hair feels sticky and dirty.</li>
<li> This shampoo is FAKE!</li>
<li> so weird!)</li>
<li> This shampoo and conditioner were awful.  </li>

    <li> this shampoo is great. I alternate between the blonde shampoo and this one to keep my blonde beautiful, shiny and healthy. This is used in conjunction with the absolut repair conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT come with any tap to get the shampoo out, you need a pump</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo before and loved it, that is why I bought a large one at this time, but, after washing my hair with it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair was weird like I&#x27;ve never felt it this way before (did not look like it was clean at all, no shine), it is strange to say it, but looks like there glue inside of this bottle (when I was drying my hair, I had to wash my hands three to four times because it was sticking, I can&#x27;t explain.. so weird!)... this is the first time that I bought something from amazon.com and I am not happy with my purchase. I would recommend this shampoo, but I would not buy online anymore, I prefer going to the store and smell it and feel the texture of it, this way I would be sure that it is not a fake one...</li>
    <li> Love,love,love this shampoo,especially for bleached blond very damaged hair.  I use it with the L&#x27;oreal Absoulut Repair cellular (lactic acid)..I&#x27;m truly very happy with my results.My hair feels great after years of treatments...</li>
    <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo.  Leaves hair soft, is non-drying, and good for color-treated hair.  Can&#x27;t find it at my salon -- glad do find it online.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected. This is professional grade shampoo which is a little more expensive, but worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> I simply love this shampoo. I&#x27;ve tested many others, but none makes my hair so soft after using like this one. You barely need hair conditioners, a good leave-in is already enough to make your hair shine :)</li>
    <li> Excelent product. succesful Delivery!!!</li>
    <li> I have tested a lots of good shampoo brands, but no one bits this one. It leaves hair really soft and helps strengthen damaged hair.</li>
    <li> It was a referral by an expert in tijuana Baja California. So she try it.it work.she&#x27;s happy, now, then ,</li>
    <li> Wonderful shampoo.  This size with the pump which you need to buy as an extra if you don&#x27;t have one is easy to use.  My kids use it and it helps prevent too much shampoo coming out at once.  Cuts down on waste !</li>
    <li> I love all products from Loreal!!!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with product.</li>
    <li> This product is very good  !</li>
    <li> Love the product itself.  This L&#x27;Oreal shampoo is great stuff.  I usually buy it at my salon for $30, for about half of the size.  This was a great value.  Only gave it 3 stars because I soooo wish it had come with a pump.  With this large size of a bottle, it&#x27;s super difficult to untwist the cap and pour into hands while in the shower every.single.time.  I didn&#x27;t save my previous smaller bottles that had pumps attached because I didn&#x27;t know I would be buying this large value size.  I am going to have to buy a smaller empty container with a pump now.  Other than that, great value for a great product.  Save your old bottles with pumps if you plan on buying this!</li>
    <li> I really love this shampoo. It repaired my blond, processed hair. I don&#x27;t even imagine switching for any other shampoo. Excellent effects</li>
    <li> Combined used with the coordinating conditioner this product retains hair coloring better than other expensive shampoos/conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner were awful.  Not at all what they sell in salons.  This did not even clean my hair.  It left a very greasy residue and I had to immediately go out and buy new shampoo and conditioner.  I would only recommend buy this product in salons.  I am returning asap.</li>
    <li> I have problem hair, dry climate, hypothyroidism, makes hair brittle, easily breaks off.  This shampoo, with the conditioner, helps maintain a healthier overall look and feel.</li>
    <li> Ok, so you spend a little more...but this is good stuff!  Buy the largest bottle for a long use, or spread it around the house.  Made hair smell nice, really gives body and shine (unlike cheaper products that claim it does! this does).  Very impressed.</li>
    <li> Our favorite L&#x27;oreal products are usually very expensive.I am happy to find some of them available in professional sizes which makes the items less expensive per ounce.We transfer the product into smaller bottles to keep in the shower.Same process with the the accompanying shampoo.Products used to be sold only in high end beauty salons are now in pharmacies but in smaller sizes. This is a far better way to purchase.it is becoming more and more difficult to find this professional size packaging.</li>
    <li> First bought this product from my salon and loved it. I searched Amazon to find better price and found it with the benefit of the large bottle. I used it daily and this size lasts me for months. The product makes my hair smooth and silky. Smells great too. Love it so much that i bought it as Christmas gifts for family members this year.</li>
    <li> Love this product! reasonable price! I have curly hair and this shampoo leaves my hair soft and smooth, with no freeze.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo good size very expensive for the job. I prefer another shampoos after i did my keratin i didnt use it anymore it isnt sulfate free</li>
    <li> This does a great job of restoring vitality to my hair even though my hair has been colored for years and exposed to heat and the elements.</li>
    <li> muy buen producto la suegra encantada con esto lo unico es que deberian envalarlo mas pequeño para que el envio no sea tan costoso</li>
    <li> great shampoo from loreal, cant go wrong leaves hair light fluffy and soft,</li>
    <li> This is a greaaaat product if your hair is damaged, waaay better than Kerastase,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s expensive but defiantly worth it.</li>
    <li> amazing , my hair and me smile !</li>
    <li> This shampoo is FAKE! I love this brand and have bought it in the store many times. But I wanted to save some money and buy it online because it is expensive. Usually my hair feels soft and silky after I use it. But after I use this one, my hair feels sticky and dirty. It also dries out my scalp and I have dandruff because of it. DO NOT buy this product.</li>
