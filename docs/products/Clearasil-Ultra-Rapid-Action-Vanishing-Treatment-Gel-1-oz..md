      <li>I think Benzoyl Peroxide works better to minimize acne quickly, so I would recommend using the cream form of this, and not this gel.</li>
      <li>Nothing has ever given me results so quickly!</li>
      <li>I was very excited by this product&#x27;s promise to reduce my (mild) acne in 4 hours, so I put it on at 7 AM and took it off at 11 AM.  </li>
      <li>Yesterday I had a huge breakout practically the size of a pencil eraser on my face.</li>

      <li>It can really help shrink some problems very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have tried proactive, clean and clear, and thousand of dermatologist &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and even though they work for a while, those didn&#x27;t leave my face smooth and pimple free.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>This is great stuff really works taking down the redness and swelling in 4 hours.  </li>
      <li>Also, its pretty noticeable under makeup, so dont recommend it before wearing makeup.</li>
      <li>Even the stubborn, under the skin bumps go away so fast!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend people against this product and would instead recommend the product I used before, Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment Oil-Free 0.75 oz.</li>

      <li>cream did absolutely noting to son face</li>

      <li>Highly recommend this for teens.</li>
      <li>This stuff is great because it&#x27;s the only one I know of in gel form so the salicylic acid stays active and in contact with skin longer than any other product.</li>

      <li>face is really clear!</li>
      <li>Works well on drying up big zits fast!</li>
      <li>If you use it every day it will start to clear your acne.</li>

      <li>There is no &#x27;rapid action&#x27; to this product AT ALL.</li>
      <li>I have never had a photosensitive reaction to anything before, nor do I consider myself to have sensitive skin, and despite washing it off and applying sunscreen</li>
      <li>This form of the Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Treatment is Salicylic Acid and not Benzoyl Peroxide, like its cream counterpart.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This product was recommended to me by a friend bc \\&quot; face is really clear! So I gave it a shot, and now my face is clearer than ever! Now I am confident to go out without any makeup without feeling self concious about ny face. I really recommend this cream to anybody that is trying to get a beautiful face. I only apply this as a spot treatment at night, applying too much or all over face can irritate it so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I recommend this to a friend</li>
    <li> Working slow, drying too much</li>
    <li> This stuff is great because it&#x27;s the only one I know of in gel form so the salicylic acid stays active and in contact with skin longer than any other product. Sometimes it can be a little drying but certainly does the job it&#x27;s intended to do!</li>
    <li> This works great for my lil tween with new found pimples</li>
    <li> This form of the Clearasil Ultra Rapid Action Vanishing Treatment is Salicylic Acid and not Benzoyl Peroxide, like its cream counterpart. For my own skin, this does nothing. I have had this product for a few months now. My acne inflammation doesn&#x27;t go down at all, and the pimples I have treated continue to worsen over the days rather than be minimized by this treatment. I think Benzoyl Peroxide works better to minimize acne quickly, so I would recommend using the cream form of this, and not this gel. The Benzoyl Peroxide helps to dry out the pimple and stop it from becoming bigger. I have tried both cream and gel, attempting to prevent the further growth of a pimple when the area feels tender and inflamed, but not red yet. The cream worked at times to minimize the pimple to the point of stopping it from maturing. If I get at it early enough, the soon-to-be pimple completely disappears. With this gel, there&#x27;s no way of stopping that process (at least for me). It doesn&#x27;t do anything, and my pimple just grows bigger. I&#x27;ve had pimples turn into cysts that I cannot drain; the pus collects and collects deep under the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your acne responds to Salicylic Acid, then this product may work wonders for you. In my case, my acne only worsened.</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good for me.  A little expensive though.</li>
    <li> this cream is good to do treatment on face skin . i have used it for 2 years  and I have no choices but using it because of it is best for people</li>
    <li> I was very excited by this product&#x27;s promise to reduce my (mild) acne in 4 hours, so I put it on at 7 AM and took it off at 11 AM.  I applied a sunscreen to my face and then spent a couple hours outside with friends.  Within a few hours, the small areas I applied it to and inches around that became inflamed, red, and had raised little bumps.  Initially, I used over-the-counter Hydrocortisone cream, but it did nothing, in fact, the bumps spread inches further on my face.  I have never had a photosensitive reaction to anything before, nor do I consider myself to have sensitive skin, and despite washing it off and applying sunscreen, I still have half of my face covered in red, raised bumps.  I have had to see the doctor twice now, and even with using a prescription-strength steroid creme for several days, the bumps have barely decreased. I would highly recommend people against this product and would instead recommend the product I used before, Clean &amp; Clear Advantage Acne Spot Treatment Oil-Free 0.75 oz. It did it&#x27;s job and is less expensive than this product.</li>
    <li> I am 31 and sometimes I get these really horrible cystic acne breakouts.  It&#x27;s horribly embarrassing and also very painful.  I am really meticulous about my skin and have tried everything.  Nothing has ever given me results so quickly! Yesterday I had a huge breakout practically the size of a pencil eraser on my face. I have family flying in tomorrow.  I wanted nothing more than to look my best and I was devastated knowing that I was going to have not one, but two huge pimples on my face when they arrived.  So, anyway,  yesterday after work I bought this product and put it on my skin when I got home.  Really and truly, about 4 hours later, before bed, it (the big one) was noticeably smaller and less painful.  I woke up this morning and it&#x27;s almost completely flat! Most of the pain is gone as well. The other one was basically dried up.  I applied more this morning while getting ready for work, which was about 7 am, and it&#x27;s now 130pm and I am spending my lunch break doing a review (which I NEVER do) because they are both noticeably even fainter than they were this morning! I feel confident about tomorrow, this stuff REALLY works!</li>
    <li> I mean acne went away a little, but i didn&#x27;t use it that much and i didn&#x27;t have it bad to start... overall not a bad buy for the price, but if you have bad acne just get the expensive stuff that works well</li>
    <li> Too small tube..very expensive</li>
    <li> This is great stuff really works taking down the redness and swelling in 4 hours.  Another great compliment to my perfected facial routines.</li>
    <li> My favorite , must have work great dries up oil, less redness . Works well on drying up big zits fast!</li>
    <li> This works nicely to quickly get rid of any pimples I may have. I really appreciate how effective this product is.</li>
    <li> There is no &#x27;rapid action&#x27; to this product AT ALL. If you use it every day it will start to clear your acne. But don&#x27;t don&#x27;t count on anything happening &#x27;rapidly&#x27;. That is all marketing hype.</li>
    <li> Great product that works well. I am an older woman who still gets an occasional breakout.  This does the trick to soothe and heal.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my pre-teen son and it works great. The price was great also. I will also tell friends</li>
    <li> This product works very well for me.  Great people to buy from w/ fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works miracles.</li>
    <li> It can really help shrink some problems very quickly.  That said, it it&#x27;s a cystic like bump, it will make it redder and bring it to the surface faster. It will also cause peeling, both good and bad.  Use with caution and be prepared or all of the posibilities.  I use it daily as a preventative and also as a necessity.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t but it does not do anything!</li>
    <li> For me, This is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have tried proactive, clean and clear, and thousand of dermatologist &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products and even though they work for a while, those didn&#x27;t leave my face smooth and pimple free.&lt;br /&gt;This GEL dries pimples and black spots without drying your skin. When the products dries up, you cant see the product on your face but with daylight it &amp;#34;shines&amp;#34;. Also, its pretty noticeable under makeup, so dont recommend it before wearing makeup.</li>
    <li> Bought this product for my fifteen-year-old son. Product works just as it says. Within four hours his face was clearer. Two days later no zits could be found anywhere on face. Highly recommend this for teens.</li>
    <li> I do not have an acne problem. I use for spot treatment of a breakout. I purchased this to replace the previous Clearsil Acne Spot pen (which is no longer produced). This seems to do the same job in performance but the pen design was easier to use (no touch application of the gel).</li>
    <li> I was hopeful after reading other reviews, but sadly this product did absolutely nothing to help clear up or even shrink my breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchased, [[ASIN:B0036IV7MS Rugby Acne Medication 10% 45gm]] and finally, my face is clear.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! It gets rid of my most stubborn pimples in a day tops! Even when I feel a pimple about to surface, I just put this gel on and the pimple never gets the chance to appear. Even the stubborn, under the skin bumps go away so fast! This gel is a miracle worker.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product. Doesn&#x27;t work as quickly as advertised though. You may want to look elsewhere for a better product.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the cream but I guess this is cheaper. But if you really want something to work faster, get the cream one. It may be like $1 or $2 more expensive but get the other one. It works much faster.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, I have used it for many years for the occasional blemish.  This is the first time  I have used it in a gel form and it works great!</li>
    <li> I  purchased this cream for son,but I should of bought  one tube only and tried it out before I purchased four tubes at once.&lt;br /&gt;This cream did absolutely noting to son face</li>
