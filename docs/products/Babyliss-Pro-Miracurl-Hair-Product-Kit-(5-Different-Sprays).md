    <li> Spray spouts clog and do not work properly after a couple of uses.  So disaapointed</li>
    <li> I love the setting lotion and the hairsprays.  My curls stay through all kinds of rainy, wet weather and yet feel soft.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter and she loves the product.  Her hair previously would not hold curl and the products sure help with that.</li>
    <li> Its pretty good, it does make your hair shine. The smell is nice, the hair spray does a descent hold.</li>
    <li> I like it and the product arrived in my home at time</li>
    <li> These are great products.  I have long straight hair and I use all of these products- some at different times and some alone.  I am happy with the way all of them work.  I have a curling brush that I use when I want volume and curls.</li>
    <li> Nice products which have helped to reduce blow drying time</li>
    <li> Great for your hair! I love the different options in here</li>
    <li> Love it great value for money!! Also bottles where much larger than I expected!! I have reordered and recommended to friends</li>
    <li> OMG I love, love, love this product collection. I have very unruly hair. Its a dyed, frizzy, fried poufy, sad excuse for a mop. My hair and I - we fight. I got to the point that I either kept it in a ponytail or ironed it into giving up its frizz-will and that&#x27;s about all I could do. These products have worked where typical store brand ones have failed. They have breathed new life into my hairs will to live, I get to have bouncy, gorgeous, smooth and styled curls too!!!...and I have to say &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; Babyliss for making me love my hair again!!!</li>
    <li> What a great deal! I bought this as a gift and loved it so much I purchased one for myself as well!</li>
    <li> Love these Babyliss products,  I use them with my miracurl and the performance does soo much better!!!</li>
    <li> Help to hold the curl if used correctly otherwise hair won&#x27;t curl. So make sure u know the order and follow instructions.</li>
    <li> wife loves your product</li>
