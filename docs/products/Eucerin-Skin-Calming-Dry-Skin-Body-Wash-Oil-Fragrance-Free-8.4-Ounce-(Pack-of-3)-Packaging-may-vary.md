<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Won&#x27;t use any other body wash - no more itching</li>
    <li> A lathering sudsing oily body wash that leave my skin softer and moister (Taking into account the hard water in Arizona).  Was using Dove liquid before and liked it but switched to Eucerin.  Feel it does a better job.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry out your skin.  It spreads out nicely and still produces some degree of lather.  It does not have a bad smell.</li>
    <li> yes it does smell faintly fishy. You won&#x27;t smell like fish when you get out, but you will notice the smell while in the shower. I don&#x27;t mind it because the product works well. Washes, moisturizes without feeling oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only mildly foaming, which the product description does include, so not for use with your pouf. Apply with your hands (exfoliate before, if you want to).</li>
    <li> I quit using baby wash products for eczema when I found this one. It works well on my baby and much older kid who have atopic skin. Highly recommended if you are dry skin prone too.</li>
    <li> This product works well on my very dry sensitive skin. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Great solution for dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Since my daughter told me about Eucerin that&#x27;s all I use.  It&#x27;s great!  Would recommend it</li>
    <li> This is a superb product for persons with dry, itchy skin. It is easy to use and results in a refreshing feeling after application.</li>
    <li> I am always shocked by the high rating eucerin products get. I know it works for a lot of people. I have not found one product of eucerin that I like! This product doesn&#x27;t smell nice. It feels nice going on in the shower. But after the shower my skin is not moisturized. I bought this because my skin has been getting sensitive and itchy. This product did nothing to make my skin less itchy and irritated. It does nothing it says. In the shower when water touches the oil it gets white and lathers a little bit. And I would not consider this a wash. I use dove soap before I use this because I do not trust that I am clean after using oil wash. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I thought the smell of this was beyond gross.  I washed 1 leg and had to quit right away.</li>
    <li> Thought it would make a difference but did not. Work outside all night so my body gets real dry.</li>
    <li> What a revelation.  Using the Calming Body Wash instead of soap has changed my life!  I can now shower without watching my skin slowly succumb to the drying effect of taking hot showers in the winter.  I have no problems with any soap in the summertime, mind you.  Its only the winter which has a devastating effect on my skin in general, and my finger tips specifically, where i get an eczema type peeling.  This product is amazing, in that my skin comes out of the shower unaffected, or even in better condition than before the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind the scent like some of the other reviewers.  To me it has a near neutral scent, which disappears quickly.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in EUCERIN CALMING BODY WASH.  It comes out as an oil, which is nice.  It doesn&#x27;t lather but turns opaque as you massage it into your skin.  I prefer more lather in a body wash, though I think it&#x27;s more psychological than anything else.  (Even though it&#x27;s not necessarily accurate, I think I need the lather to feel clean.)  I could have gotten past that, however (as the product does clean the skin), if the after-shower results were worth it.  I used the wash several times when I had time to wait for an hour or so before slathering on lotion.  Unfortunately, after washing with this product my skin actually feels drier and tighter than it does after washing with the oatmeal-based bar soap I was looking to replace.  Like I said, very disappointing!</li>
    <li> I just took a shower with this stuff.  It faintly smells like the salmon eggs that come in a jar that you use to fish with.  However, the end result is that I&#x27;m clean and the smell didn&#x27;t \\&quot;stick\\&quot; and I&#x27;m not itchy.  I think I&#x27;ll explore other options before buying this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product and use it throughout the year on my son who has dry skin/excema.  It&#x27;s especially great during winter months.  The product, when poured into the hand, feels \\&quot;oily\\&quot;...but lathers nicely and gently cleanse.  Does not leave only feeling on skin or bathtub, but very moisturizing.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent body wash for anyone with sensitive dry skin.  I have psoriasis and most soaps and body washes irritate my skin and make the condition worst and causes itching.  Eucerin Skin Calming Dry Skin Body Wash gets my skin clean without making it itch.</li>
    <li> Running a pellet stove for our main heat dries out the air in the house. Humidifiers help but this  bathing oil leaves my middle aged skin soft and supple.</li>
    <li> This product smells really bad.  It Smells Like Cod Fish Or Raw Cod Fish oil.  The smell is so unpleasant that made me nauseous.  Leaves the skin soft,  but can&#x27;t tolerate the smell.</li>
    <li> The smell is just aweful. I could use it one time and had to trash the whole bottle. Very sad since the product looked very promising.</li>
    <li> I just can&#x27;t take most soaps on the market today.  They dry my skin out something terrible.  I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin Calming Body Wash since February 2011 and have to say, this is the best stuff out there.  Knock on wood, no dry skin!  It cleans without stripping your skin of essential oils.  Thank goodness someone finally came up with a body wash that doesn&#x27;t leave your skin as dry as sandpaper.  I&#x27;m stocking up on this stuff....</li>
    <li> Used even a couple of times a week, The &#x27;Eucerin Calming Body Wash&#x27; absolutely helped my dry patches of skin soften up and maintain the look and feel that lotion provides. The difference is that is lasts a whole lot longer without needing additional application during the day. I use this product on my elbows and knees and without utilization I would not wear shorts.</li>
    <li> I am a lifelong eczema suffer. It does not dry out my skin during washing. It is also works out better during the winter by preventing my skin from cracking and splitting. The product that I got from Amazon was fresh and works better than the bottles that I got from a regular store (they had a strange smell to them). You have got to try it!</li>
    <li> A simple lotion did me no good and I&#x27;d been through the top line stuff including Vaseline and Lubriderm. I used to have insanely dry skin before using this, it was so bad in fact I could graze nearly anything and it would appear as if dust is flowing from my skin. It also held a gray color due to all the flaking. The embarrassment had stolen my life for years; I wouldn&#x27;t have hesitated turning down my dream girl just to keep her from seeing this. The best thing is I saw major improvements after only 1 week and of course I won&#x27;t have to cover up as much.    This is really one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I got this product to use on my daughter, who has eczema.  I thought that the omega fatty acid/oils used in this body wash would be very helpful in keeping the eczema under control, which it might do, but before I used it on her I tested it out on myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wash is oily (as it says) but does lather when used on the body.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily find it any different from other moisturizing body washes.  EXCEPT I immediately noticed that fishy smell associated with omega fatty acids.  I am particularly scent sensitive, and dislike fish in regards to food, as well as sensitive to the smell of fish oil caps (my husband takes them), so after lathering up half my body and repulsed by the scent I rinsed and rewashed with my usual body wash.  But even with my usual body wash on the wash cloth, the smell of fish was still present.  Fortunately, I was able to get the smell off me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this smell issue I have with the product could be turned to a positive- they clearly are really using omega fatty acids as the oil base in the product.  But if you have a very sensitive nose and don&#x27;t care to smell like a fish, then this might not be the right product for you!</li>
    <li> Much more oil than soap and smells like an old woman.</li>
    <li> It does lather like soap, but I didn&#x27;t notice a different after using entire bottle.  I expected it to leave my skin a little moisturized.  BUT, I still needed to put on lotion after getting out of shower.  I will stick with Olay Moisturinse In Shower body lotion.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve had severe eczema for several years, and my new dermatologist told me to ditch all of Bath &amp; Body Works products and others and switch to this product for body wash, Aveeno shave creme, Aveeno or Eucerin moisturizers, etc.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t have a fishy smell (so maybe some got some &#x27;old product&#x27;) and leaves my skin feeling great. I was concerned it would be like washing with baby oil, but it is not... it acutally makes a bit of a lather.  After using this product for about a month, I can tell a real difference. Just ordered the 3-pack as it comes out to be about $2 less per bottle than my local retailer.  This hasn&#x27;t cured my eczema, as I also got a prescription, but this product certainly doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin the way other products do.  It&#x27;s a little pricey when compared to what I used to use, but it is well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Last year, I moved from Florida to Ohio and the change in climate has been hardest on my skin!  I had extremely itchy and dry skin that would crack easily no matter how much lotion I slathered on after my shower.      I am so glad that I found this body wash.  It saved my skin this winter and I saw improvement as soon as I started using it.  I continue to use it in the summer primarily on my legs before shaving.</li>
    <li> I have suffered my whole life with Ichthyosis vulgaris. Wikipedia it. It is terrible! My dry skin will crack and create bloody cuts. The skin is painful when inflamed. I also have a build up of scales everywhere. This is the first product that has ever helped including all the stuff doctors have given me. It does smell a little funny, but I think it smells like cooking oil. For a good soap like lather use a bath puff. I also use a loofah scrubber on my face and back,(the least affected areas) for a deep clean. I love this stuff and for the first time in 48 years I almost have skin like a normal person!</li>
    <li> Was allergic to it - worked well except got the hived</li>
    <li> I was a little scared to try this as the reviews are mixed about the smell. Therefore I decided to buy a pilot bottle at CVS. Yes, it does smell but it is not the gag-fest some of the reviewers have been making it out to be. It smells slightly of cod liver oil while you are using it but the smell does not remain on your skin or even linger in the shower after you turn the water off. I have severely dry itchy skin and this product and the calming moisturizer have helped a lot.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I use it every other day and it helps to clear up my dry skin, especially on my face. I&#x27;ve used many other products, but this one actually works. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t lather up and yes, it does have a strange smell, but put that aside if you want your skin to feel silky smooth and moist. Buy it! In my opinion, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Because of my dry skin, this is the product my doctor recommended.  Unfortunately, it is not always available at local stores.</li>
    <li> This body wash is wonderful!  It works great on my eczema.  I still use some kind of light body lotion, but may not need that in the dead of summer if I use this wash.  This wash is very mild and kind to dry, itchy skin, fragrance-free, and the very slight oil smell (soybean oil?) is not offensive in the least.  It does have a mild foaming action, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about not feeling clean with this.  I find this hard to find in the stores around here, and order from Amazon.  You will not be sorry you bought this!</li>
    <li> Had to return it due to smell. To me it smelled a little fishy and quite... plasticky, the way oils smell when they&#x27;re old. When I first sniffed it from the bottle, I thought it might be tolerable, but when I tried it in the bath, I discovered it was not. The smell is worse with warm water, and it does stay on the skin a bit.</li>
    <li> Some folks said there was no odor, while the flip side said there was an odor.  Wish I would&#x27;ve listen to the folks that complained about the odor.  I did try to get creative &amp; mix Eucerin body wash with a fragrant body wash; that didn&#x27;t work, not even a little bit.  So now I have 3 bottles of product I refuse to use &amp; will likely end up in the trash.  Pity though, I like Eucerin products, and with my dry skin I thought this would be great body wash to use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just using a small free sample bottle and so far I really like it. The scent isn&#x27;t much to complain about. It smells like vitamin E. It&#x27;s definitely the Omega-3 content that&#x27;s causing the smell.     I&#x27;m the type of person that likes my soaps &amp; detergents unscented; free &amp; clear all the way. The slightest hint of artificial fragrance or perfume bothers me intensely, but so far I didn&#x27;t even notice the scent of this until I started reading the reviews. I had to go back and stick the bottle to my nose to see what all the fuss was all about.    It may smell when applying but it easily washes off, leaving no hint of the vitamin E odor.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of soothing dry skin. There is a faint smell. Omega oils smell to me. I do not notice after dressing. My husband says he does not smell anything on me. I will continue to use because my skin does not itch from dryness like it did.</li>
    <li> Nothing else quite like it. Good for sensitive skin. And no SLS (sodium laureth sulfate) to dry out or irritate your skin! Recommend to me by a dermatologist and been using it ever since for 3 years + at least.</li>
    <li> This wash will really reduce winter itching if you use it instead of soap while showering during the colder months.</li>
    <li> They hit a home run with this one. My contact dermatitis cleared up completely after just a few days of using this product. Continued use took 5 years off my skin. I will never use soap again. Please don&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
    <li> Yes, I have read that some people are put off by the fish oil scent of Eucerin Calming Oil; but, it does not remain as a scent.  It washes off immediately leaving dry skin moisturized and soft.  Living in the Desert of Southern California, moisturizing is crucial every single day. For myself, I just got over the scent and appreciated the wonderful job it does.  After all, we are oiling our skin and oiling with help of omega.  I would rather have the honest scent of fish oil; than the manufacturers fib to us with false fragrances.  An excellent and honest product!  Thank you, Eucerin.</li>
    <li> Feels good to my sensitive skin. I t does seem to live my skin a little dry. I don&#x27;t feel as mosturized with this product, however, it do not irritate my skin like most products that i have used.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  This is the only product that I shower with.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash.  Gentle on skin expecially during the long, cold winter which is great for dry, itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Smells horrible and I feel queazy on an empty stomach in the morning while you use.  The smell does wash off well.  Does help me not itch...if I can&#x27;t find anything else that works this well, guess I might return to it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry, flakey skin.  No slimey, oily feel in the shower or on your body after use.  A little goes a very long way and my dry skin problem has improved significantly since I began using this product (four months ago).  It has completely allowed me to stop using bar soaps; it has softened my feet, too which is a nice plus.  Again, it does not leave a greasy film in the shower nor does it make for a slippery shower floor.  Cleaning the shower is as easy as it was before use of the product.  I only mention this as other oil-containing body washes left horrible rings and a slippery shower floor that was hard to clean.  Not so with this...</li>
    <li> i have skin that gets a little dry but otherwise doesn&#x27;t need much. this is a very mild product without any unnecessary packaging of fragrance gimmicks. it doesn&#x27;t lather very well, but soap really doesn&#x27;t need to in order to clean you. thats just another marketing thing. i think this is a very effective, no BS product.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
    <li> I love Eucerin&#x27;s regular body lotion, but they really blew it with the smell of this product. It&#x27;s like rancid fish. Would not buy again. It didn&#x27;t hurt nor help my skin. Probably the most nauseating skin product I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
    <li> does the job but smells bad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feels like oil with soap, but it does not bother as much as the smell</li>
    <li> This product does have a distinctive smell to it, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not fish oil.  I&#x27;ve checked the ingredient list and the only ingredient that appears to have an animal source is lanolin alcohol.  I personally don&#x27;t mind the smell because it&#x27;s pretty neutral (IMO) and the product is AMAZING!  I have atopic dermatitis on my arms and legs and this product in combination with Eucerin Intensive Repair body lotion works wonders.  Prior to this I used Cetaphil body wash and lotion.  I find that Eucerin products do a much better job calming the inflammation and keeping my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I really like this product; I have insanely itchy excema between my fingers which cracks and bleeds as well as dry, itchy skin on my legs and this has helped a lot.  As far as the smell goes, I don&#x27;t see the big deal.  I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to smell and, although I noticed a vague, oily smell it wasn&#x27;t enough to put me off using it at all.  Also, if it smelled like roses, it would probably dry my skin out and leave me with great smelling flakes of skin dropping off.  It&#x27;s more than a fair trade-off IMO, since the slight smell doesn&#x27;t linger in the shower and is not noticeable at all on my skin.  Overall, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Might be good for the skin (personally I didn&#x27;t see any benefits) but the smell kills me.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin then this is the soup for you. I used to have a problem where I&#x27;d get red irritation after using soup on my face that took a few hours to go away. That is no longer an issue now that I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a funky smell but once you rinse the smell is gone.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing. The body wash has a  distinct smell that reminds me of fish oil, however it does not persist after the shower. It has made my skin feel more comfortable and less itchy. The bottle is smaller than the average bodywash and it does not lather. You only need a small amount to clean your body and lather is not necessary.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t need a body wash with alot of fragrance.  This is great.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
    <li> Eucerin body wash has been the answer to my winter itchy skin, use it every shower with a follow up of the Eucerin cream, together they keep me comfortable all day.</li>
    <li> I was told about this product from the Eucerin site, they claimed that it helps keep winter itchy, dry skin away. I am very happy I tried it.  I bought it from another retailer, but will purchase here next time because of the savings.  I used to use olive oil and avacado oil on my skin everyday at the end of my shower to help bring back some moisture, but since buying this soap I no longer need the oils. People have complained about the smell, but it smells natural and earthy to me. I also follow up with Eucerins daily replenishing lotion which is light and soaks in quickly. I&#x27;m in the process of changing my son over to this soap also because he has sensitive skin too. You do have to get used to a no lather soap with this, but the pay off is worth it!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter recently because of dry skin, eczema &amp; psoriasis and we can finally stop our hunt for the perfect moisturizing body wash because we&#x27;ve found it in this one! My husband &amp; I even started using it because of how well it worked for her &amp; neither of us are experiencing the normal dry itchy skin from harsh winters. So glad to have found this &amp; will be buying again!</li>
    <li> I received a sample bottle of this body wash from a dermatologist&#x27;s office in a bag full of various samples.  At first I thought it was just shower oil, but then I noticed that it lathered slightly.  It gets you clean and soft in one easy step.  It is non-drying but not greasy in the slightest.  Wow this is like liquid silk !  This product is nice enough that I bought four more bottles to give my nieces as Christmas gifts.  They love it and I myself will NEVER be without it !</li>
    <li> This is my go to body wash for my sensitive skin. It calms my skin with the&lt;br /&gt;oils in this product. This is a body wash I keep on hand, especially in the&lt;br /&gt;warm summer months!!!</li>
    <li> I grew up in the humid South, so when I moved to Southern CA my skin got so dry.  It was really uncomfortable.  I started using this body wash oil, and I really like it.  It&#x27;s unscented, but the oil has a kind of nutty smell, similar to oil supplements but not as strong.  The smell doesn&#x27;t stick around at all, though. It does a great job  of making you feel clean while still leaving your skin moisturized.  And not an artificial, weird lotiony-moisture- just clean and comfortable.  My skin does feel much nicer, though I&#x27;m still using a moisturizer every few days, too.  Also, the makers of Euricen don&#x27;t test on animals, though I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;ve gotten Leaping Bunny Certification, so take that as you will.&lt;br /&gt;Neither my husband nor I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m not sure whether this would be good for those with sensitive skin or things like excema, but I would expect it to be.&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s good for sensitive or super dry skin, I do get bored with the lack of scent.  I just add essential oils to spruce it up.  Overall a great product- nothing exotic or luxurious, but the fact that it&#x27;s so basic means you can modify it pretty easily with your own oils or scents for fun.  This is a staple at our house- my husband and I use it religiously!</li>
    <li> Really does calm the itching as advertised.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except that you need to be careful using it in a shower because it makes the shower tile floor slippery. Takes a little practice to get the right amount on the wash cloth so it doesn&#x27;t run through.</li>
    <li> This works great. I have dry skin and this makes my skin fell very soft. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product.  I use this for my 1 year old and for myself.  Works well during dry seasons.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products over the years to get some relief from my eczema and this is a winner!  I have no more eczema rashes since I started using this.  Lathers slightly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and greasy after my shower.  Kind of a happy middle on the lather to greasy ratio.  Shake well before pouring, though, since there is oil in it and you don&#x27;t want to get to the bottom of the bottle and find it is not as good as it once was.  If you shake well each time, you can use it all the way to the bottom with no difference.  I love this and walmart used to sell it around here, but stopped for some reason which ends up being ok with me since amazon sells it cheaper anyway!</li>
    <li> Doctor recommended to my wife who has sensitive skin . It works !</li>
    <li> Our daughter has mild eczema that usually acts up in hot weather or overly dry weather.  This soap has helped us manage her eczema.  It is an &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34; soap that becomes milky in the bath.  It does get very bubbly so it is easy to get her all clean with the soap.  It has a very light, clinical, scent that doesn&#x27;t really stay on once the bath is done.  If you are looking for a bathtime option to help with sensitive skin, you might give this a try.</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Product as described</li>
    <li> I seem to be pleased with it so far. Time will tell.</li>
    <li> The only wash we use on our eczema-prone son. Everything else dries him out and causes the eczema to flare. It doesn&#x27;t lather and the smell is strange, but it gets him clean and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay on his skin. That&#x27;s all that matters. Have used it for years now and will continue to. We use it in conjunction with Stelatopia Milky Bath Oil in the bath, and then straight up coconut oil on his skin when he gets out of the bath. (Lotions sting him badly.) We also use a prescription steroid cream when he has flare ups. But basically kids with eczema will have an easier time if they keep away from soap and lotions and stick to gentle oils with as few chemicals and other added ingredients as possible.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Calming Body Wash is great for sensitive skin.  My skin is very soft after using.  I find I only need to use it every other day wich is good since it is a bit pricey.  In my opinion it is does not smell like fish or fish oils and is therefore unsented.  Delivery was quite timely.[[ASIN:B0018MIT70 Eucerin Calming Body Wash Daily Shower Oil, 8.4-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]]</li>
    <li> We have extremely hard water, and I have very dry skin.  Until I began using Eucerin I was itching like a baboon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great, and while it has a slight odor in the bottle, no one can smell it on your skin.  The smell thing is overblown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use perfume or cologne if your still concerned, the added benefit is you will get lucky more often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many Eucerin  products for a long time, but it took me a while to decide to try the Skin Calming Dry Skin Body Wash Oil simply because it is an &#x27;oil.&#x27;  However, after using it now for several months, I think it is great.  It really works.  It leaves the skin clean, moist &amp; refreshed without any oily residue on the body (or in the shower)!</li>
    <li> Easy on delicate skin. Has no perfumes or extra additives. Does not make the skin too dry.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stress enough how much of a lifesaver this body wash has been. In the winter months, dry skin really becomes a problem around here, but this product, coupled with Mustela&#x27;s Lipid-Replenishing Balm really solves the problem. We tried so many products and wasted so much money--all we needed was this!</li>
    <li> Very good recommend by dermatologists for my mom skin.</li>
    <li> seems to have a good moisturising all day after shower, we&#x27;ll come to know of the result after sometime of use regularly.</li>
    <li> BEWARE!!  The product I received not only had the nasty fish smell as described by others, it also contained Propylene Glycol, which the real product from Eucerin is not supposed to contain.  The description on Amazon lists the ingredients, and Propylene Glycol is not listed.  I don&#x27;t know if the product I received is counterfeit, a cheaper version intended for third-world markets, or a new formula.  Whatever the case, I ended up with horrible itchy inflammation on my face and chest from using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol (antifreeze) is a harsh chemical which has no business being in any non-industrial products, especially ones meant for sensitive skin.  Many people have skin allergies because of exposure to it, including myself.  Five years ago, my skin was normal aside from occasional dryness during the winter months.  Then I started getting nasty red inflammation and itchiness on my skin, where I would use moisturizer.  Over time, I had become sensitized to Propylene Glycol -- I previously had zero allergies or skin problems -- and now I am allergic to it on contact.  As an added bonus, Propylene Glycol is used in an alarming number of food products, and it is usually not disclosed -- they like to disguise it as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;artificial flavors,&amp;#34; or in an &amp;#34;extract.&amp;#34;  After becoming sensitized and continuing to eat products which contained Propylene Glycol without my knowledge, I now am allergic to it in food as well.  So, as a 47-year-old previously-healthy individual with no allergies until 5 years ago, I would advise everyone to stay away from anything containing Propylene Glycol.  I&#x27;m not the only one this has happened to, and I believe there are multitudes who have not yet identified the source of their skin problems, many of whom will likely find out that they, too, have become sensitized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product, the one that I&#x27;ve been buying from local stores for 2-3 years and is free of Propylene Glycol and the fishy odor, is a very good product, worthy of five stars.  My dermatologists told me it was safe to use, and that despite the strangeness of it being oily and not lathering or leaving skin &amp;#34;squeaky clean,&amp;#34; it is the best way to clean your skin and not dry it out.  I even saw a Dr. Oz episode where he said the same thing.  If yours smells like fish or says Propylene Glycol in the ingredients, however, return it or dispose of it.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this in my shower for months now and used it probably twice. The smell is not at all pleasant. The product is unfragranced, which can be a good thing, but not in this case. I just can&#x27;t convince myself to use it again.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and this product gets me clean (deoderant comes off) without as much dryness and I haven&#x27;t noticed an oily residue in the shower stall yet.</li>
    <li> We travel and go to the FL parks a lot. Carry some of this in a small container to wash hands with. Beats using that harsh pink soap stocked in public bathrooms.</li>
    <li> This has a good lather for an oil based soap.  I don&#x27;t mind the scent, kind of nutty.  In the winter, the air is drier and this keeps my skin from itching after a shower.  I use it on a nylon scrubby, that helps it lather.  I would recommend it for dry itchy skin.</li>
    <li> Perfect for very dry, sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> Eucerin wash Doctor recommended to me and I have never stopped since I started.  I do use Bathy and Body soap with it and it comes with lovely fragrance then also!  Use the Eucerin and you will find this brand name has he best items always.  Doctor recommended.</li>
    <li> This was the winner when discussed by the internests, dermatologists, and exercise physiologists at cardiac rehab. Interesting.Try it, you might like it!</li>
    <li> I love this body wash!  It made my skin feel so relaxed and silky. I love using it after a hard day and I love that it lathers</li>
    <li> My little guy has bad exzema and really sensitive skin.  We have yet to find anything else that we can bathe him with that doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.  Contrary to what others are saying, I haven&#x27;t really found a problem with smell. It dosen&#x27;t really smell much like anything.  He comes out of the tub feeling really soft and no more rough flakey dry skin. we use the Eucerin Origninal Moisterizing lotion and medical grade lanolin. The only thing that works.</li>
    <li> Great Product!!! This product does wonders on my skin. I have eczema and prone to rashes, so after trying so many different and expensive products I tried this one and my skin feels soft and not itchy at all. Relax, I know that people are saying that the odor is a problem but it actually smells just like Vitamin E oil. It doesn&#x27;t lather too much though.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash and was extremely happy to find it.  It moisturizes better than any of the other leading body washes I have used.  It is extremely helpful in managing my psoriasis because it does not dry my skin. The price is great too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I have extremely dry skin and this cleaner keeps my skin from eczema break outs.</li>
    <li> Pefect, not oily at all. It is soft on the skin and of course after showering I add the aquaphor right after out of the shower.</li>
    <li> reduces dryness/itching</li>
    <li> Dry weather in NV was taking it&#x27;s toll on my skin. Suffered from itching wherever clothes constantly rubbed, it was maddening. I added this to my regular body wash and the itching was gone within two days!  Skipped a couple days and the itching returned. This stuff works, very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;YMMV.</li>
    <li> This is so good on my son&#x27;s skin. I will continue to buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> My 14 week old son had horrible skin problems for most of his short life.  I took him to the dermatologist who recommended the eucerdin.  After 7 days of bathing him with this and applying cerve in the tub afterwards his skin is almost completely healed!!!  This fixed his skin in a week.  Six trips to the pediatrician didn&#x27;t go nearly as good a job!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  Great price!</li>
    <li> I love everyting about this body wash. My humidifier at night, this shower oil, followed by vasoline intensive lotion and wala, ooo la la skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. No fragrance but it is so gentle and non-drying. Great after too much sun as it does not irritate or dry newly tanned skin. It does contain oils but lathers nicely and no tub scum. If you want to keep your tan longer try this. Also great in drying New England winter weather!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff feels good once you are out of the shower but using it, it smells like fish oil but not as strong. It does leave the skin soft.</li>
    <li> This body wash actually works at soothing and moisturizing dry skin! I removed a star because it has a strange scent that reminds me slightly of cod liver oil. I still use it because nothing else I&#x27;ve tried has worked to get rid of chafed dry skin, but the smell is a little off putting. I&#x27;ve asked others and it seems they can smell it in the bottle but don&#x27;t notice the scent after I&#x27;ve used it. Although I can smell it on my skin until I wash with a different scent. The smell doesn&#x27;t seem to bother most people. But as far as helping dry skin, it works great.</li>
    <li> Very good product for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it now for the past 5 years on my children and it did wonders in healing eczema and moisturizing their sensitive skins. I use it with Eucerin skin calming creme.</li>
    <li> Mom always love the way it makes her feel.. The only problem we had was the caps were broken... Did lose some wrote company did not hear anything back.. Overall it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin when it comes to sulfates and dyes and all those chemicals you find in regular soaps. This stuff is great. I feel super clean and my skin feels so soft and moisturized. Can&#x27;t beat the price either at less than 5 bucks a bottle it&#x27;s cheaper by quite a bit than my local store. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I specifically purchased this Eucerin product for my husband, who recently learned he has severe allergic contact dermatitis. One ingredient he must avoid is propylene glycol, which is used in lots of shampoos, cleansers, lotions, etc. Propylene glycol is not among the ingredients listed (still as of today) in this product on Amazon.com. Thus, I was extremely disappointed today when we opened the Amazon box and see that it contains several ingredients different than those listed on the website, including propylene glycol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this two stars because the product may be just fine for others with sensitive skin. Also, I&#x27;m not sure whose responsibility it is (or should be) -- the manufacturer or Amazon -- to make sure the ingredients lists are current. I understand that manufactures may change ingredients at their whim, but it&#x27;s a big deal when they add something that some folks can&#x27;t tolerate.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a significant difference in skin hydration with this compared to other body washes I&#x27;ve tried, it&#x27;s really helped with my skin. I did notice the &#x27;fishy&#x27; smell others have complained about, but it was always a transient smell while showering - it&#x27;s never lingered on my skin afterwards. My only complaint with this wash is that it doesn&#x27;t lather that well (anyone have any advice?) so I end up using a lot of it each time I shower, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Eucerin fragrance free is a great product for those who suffer from eczema.  It cleans and moisturizers the skin, while being safe for eczema sufferers.</li>
    <li> I love all of the eucerin  skin body lotions.  This calming dry skin wash oil is amazing.  There is not actually oil feeling, and I lathers&lt;br /&gt;really super.  My body feels extra refreshed, and smooth.  I also use the dry skin lotion which is equally amazing.  No itching, no&lt;br /&gt;dry skin, and a little bit goes along way.  I LOVE THE BODY SKIN WASH!  Jan C</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m thrilled. I bought this because I have very dry skin and Keratosis pilaris and I pretty much try everything to treat it. This is the first body wash that I&#x27;ve repurchased. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now and I&#x27;ve noticed huge improvement in my skin&#x27;s appearance and texture. I use it with a natural bristle bath brush for exfoliation.  The only down side is that it smells REALLY FUNKY. It&#x27;s very off-putting at first. It&#x27;s like a mineral, almost fishy fragrance.  Thankfully, it doesn&#x27;t stick to your skin at all(I even made my husband smell me), the scent rinses off with the lather.  I certainly recommend people with trouble skin and KP to try this.</li>
    <li> It is pure and eliminates itching especially in Winter when the skin seems drier. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> i began using this product when i moved to las vegas.  it was so incredibly DRY there, they even had relative humidity in the negative numbers!  you don&#x27;t have to use very much, put it on a bath sponge and a quarter-sized dollop will be plenty.  this product was heaven-sent since i am allergic to my heart and kidney medications and they give me awful rashes and itching to the point where i could not sleep.  i&#x27;d have gone crazy without it.  this calms the itch and allows the skin to heal under a light coat of oil that you won&#x27;t even feel.  it stays on you and not on your clothes.  it&#x27;s so nice to have skin that feels soft and flexible and not like an iguana!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and soap usually leaves me itching even though I use copious amounts of water to rinse it off.  Eucerin Body Wash has cured my after shower pains.  I use to scratch so much that I left bruises on my legs, but no more.  Also, the price is cheaper than the Drug Stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this. I was looking for a body wash that was so moisturizing that I wouldn&#x27;t need to use lotion. I was hoping this product would be just what I was looking for. Sadly, it was not. It simply does not moisturize. In fact, I noticed no difference in the texture of my skin. I will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Within a few uses there is a noticeable difference to the skin of all members of the family who have been using it. Coincidence or just a change from the norm? don&#x27;t know but time will tell I guess.</li>
    <li> This product was okey but fragrance free unfortunately means it smells pretty bad (fish-like). So if this would be a problem, you might look for something else.</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my wife and daughter due to their sensitive and sometimes dry skin. It works, but takes alot to build lather. But it&#x27;s well worth the price and the amount used. Can&#x27;t be tight about one&#x27;s health.</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has dry skin and this produce is the best so far. None other helped. It is tear free and she enjoys playing in the suds.</li>
    <li> I really do love this body wash. It cleans and moisturizers without worsening my dermatitis. I apply a body lotion afterwards and feel almost like a normal person who doesn&#x27;t itch all the time. The bumps that I&#x27;ve had on my outer biceps all my life have almost disappeared. I just hate the smell, which is not something I would normally complain about. But it&#x27;s atrocious.</li>
    <li> I got this product for my 87 year old mother who has both dry skin and a problem with eczema. As a former redhead she struggles with skin sensitivity and reacts to chemicals and fragrances. She loves this. She reports that it calms her skin and leaves it feeling both soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This winter, my skin has gotten so dry and I had to buy a humidifier, products for my skin as it starting peeling and flaking. I always apply lotion when I shower everyday so I got a little frantic this winter. This is a a great product to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> Its really a very good Product for people with Sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use this in tandem with Eucerin&#x27;s Original Repair Cream and works like a charm. I understand that some people are complaining about the &amp;#34;smell &amp;#34; of this product. I can&#x27;t detect ANY smell at all and just to make sure I asked several friends to smell it as well and they agree with me. It leaves my skin feeling soothed and moisturized</li>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive to pefumes and such.  This product keeps my skin hydrated without oilyness or too much lather.  Our dog was itching and scratching himself to distraction til we started bathing him with it.  I have it on autoship.</li>
    <li> Perfect soap for my son who has eczema. It relieves him of his problem.</li>
    <li> Dont do it. This stuff smells like that dirty girl you met at a bar late one night in downtown buffalo, took her home and thankfully changed your mind and left. The soap works great and i suffered through all 3 bottles and made my skin feel nice but ill never buy this again. I really thought id get use to the odor but it was not the case. After the first 2 bottles i poured some out and mixed in some tea tree oil to try to add some fragrance and overpower the omega scent but the soap turned to a white slime in some weird chemical reaction. Id say this soap is good if you dont have a sensitive nose but i couldnt get past the fishy stink.</li>
    <li> Did its job on the actual washing by not drying out my skin and while I&#x27;m not overly sensitive to smells, I stopped using it because of the weird and very strong smell when using it in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, per se, but it didn&#x27;t smell nice either. It didn&#x27;t leave any residual smell after I got out of the shower though, but I wish it had smelled like nothing instead of whatever it was. I would still lotion after every shower despite using this stuff but it didn&#x27;t make me feel like I was peeling out of my skin.</li>
    <li> Like the way my skin feels after using this soap...not dried out. Matches it&#x27;s name! Try it...I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I started using this regularly before the Winter season actually set it (I live in Indiana, and it is awful on my skin).  I have not noticed an odor.  In fact, I was happy that it was a neutral smell that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the perfume I wear.  Prior to using this product (and following up with the Calming Lotion), I am having the best Winter ever in terms of not being dry and itchy all of the time!  I use it and the lotion after every shower. Defintely worth the cost, and you save so much on Amazon (compared to local drugstores, etc.)  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> My sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t itch after using this,  however it&#x27;s got a funky smell.  Like expired olive oil.  The good news is, the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on my skin.</li>
    <li> I really do like this product for its functional use, it works really well!  The one downside is the ingrediant of caster oil, which probably makes it as effient of a product as it is, is really pugent, kind of fishy smelling.  Bad enough where I hold my breath for as long as possible and then breath through my mouth when using it. I did still use it all winter long, because it works! So if you can stand the smell and don&#x27;t mind not smelling like a flower (or anything plesant) after steping out of the shower (scent fades quickly)this is a product for you!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my dry itchy skin. It had a nice smell but did not help my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> My skin gets so dry during the winter that I would sometimes will scratch till it bled. No more. When i use this in the shower, I am itch free for the whole day.  I had been looking for something every winter for 50 years and discovered this two years ago. Itchy skin is not life threatening, but it can certainly ruin your day. No other product works for me. I start using it as soon as they turn the heat on in the building. No dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> This works great to keep my daughters eczema under control. Had issues finding it in stores after her doc gave us lots of samples to try, Glad I found it here!</li>
    <li> I have chemical allergies so this would be a perfect product.  However I do not like that it has a plasticky strange smell, it is supposed to be fragrance free.  It does not lather so I end up using a lot of the product.  However, it does moisturize the skin with a gentle non-oily feeling, so it does what it says it does&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I gave one to Mom - she hated it, she thinks it smells fishy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not buy this again</li>
    <li> I love this and it has become magic to me. I have very dry skin and is is like taking a soothing bath. I am allergic to most cosmetics and creams; and I have found this to be wonderful for my skin. I also use this to wash my face and then follow it up with professional&lt;br /&gt;Eucerin for very dry skin. My skin is now &amp;#34;soft as a baby&#x27;s ........!!!!!&amp;#34;  It is truly a miracle.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic.  I was having problems with very itchy skin and started using this and it is perfect for me.  Next, there is not fish oil in this body wash.  I don&#x27;t understand people saying it is fishy smelling.  It&#x27;s not perfume, that&#x27;s all I care about.  It does not have a pretty smell because it&#x27;s just not that kind of wash, but it also doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.  I put extra virgin coconut oil on my wet skin after this while I&#x27;m still in the shower and blot dry.  No more fancy lotions, just one ingredient.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Its a shower gel and a skin conditioner.  Both me and my husband love it for both dry winter and summer skin.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather up that great BUT it helped relieve my dry skin.  I used it along with Eucerin&#x27;s Professional Repair Lotion.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It helps tremendously, especially when shaving my legs to keep razor bumps away and to keep my skin feeling healthy and hydrated. I think it would work well to any skin type and I would suggest it to people with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different products in the past and never could find anything that worked on my very dry, itchy skin.  This product does it all.  After using this when I shower, my skin no longer has that dry, itchy, scaly feeling.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily feeling, your skin feels as smooth as when you were a baby.  Another plus is the price.  It is so cost effective and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin or any derma problems you need to start using oil based. This is the only one on the market that I have found that performs well. My skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> People complain about the odor, I don&#x27;t have the same complaint. It doesn&#x27;t smell like much of anything. I like how it lathers up well and leaves my baby feeling clean. She has eczema and drying but I have see a 100% improvement since i started using this.</li>
    <li> Good on skin awesome feels good fresh nice and smooth no dryness perfect. Love it, use it everyday and always feel amazing.</li>
    <li> This product stops all of the winter itchy skin.  It is fantastic.  There are no bubbles, but that is not a problem.</li>
    <li> I love.this stuff. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my old skin as much as regular soap. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell either which is also a plus.</li>
    <li> This body wash is a dream.  It leaves my son&#x27;s skin feeling silky soft, helps clear up his dry skin rash, and doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance or other irritants.  Great option for those with sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy whose skin gets dry and itchy every fall and winter. This body wash has been a big help and has not made my shower slippery, sticky, or gross, which I was worried about since this is oily in texture. I think the fact it&#x27;s a sudsy oil makes the difference there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell was certainly off-putting at first. I think it&#x27;s due to the castor oil. I seem to remember that being in our medicine cabinet when I was a kid and I think I recognize the smell. I can&#x27;t call the smell disgusting but neither can I call it pleasant. I just know that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, thankfully, and the end result is worth the momentary shock to the olfactory senses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, I noticed my chihuahua was also starting to itch with the change in the weather, so on a whim I decided to give him a bath with it. Not only did he stop itching, but his coat is super soft now.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s reallyyyyyy gooodddd. You could see changes in your skin immediately.  I used it for my three years old daughter and it&#x27;s very easy to apply. HIGHLY RECOMMEDED.</li>
    <li> This wash makes my skin feel great and works great for dry skin and eczema. My big issue is it smells so weird. I can&#x27;t describe it any other way than fishy. I tried mixing it with my aveeno wash but the smell won&#x27;t back down. It doesn&#x27;t foam up a lot and rinses clean. I&#x27;m going to finish the bottle because I don&#x27;t like to waste stuff but I don&#x27;t think ill be purchasing it again unless I see life changing results.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the BEST for eczema!! Often times it&#x27;s just the soap you use that needs to be changed for sensitive skin. IMMEDIATE relief from constant nagging itching. And after your itching doesn&#x27;t plague you anymore, this will keep it gone!! Absolutely worth the money for those with sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve retired all brands of regular soap .Seriously!!</li>
    <li> I mix a bit of this with my body wash. Works great for my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> In our cold, dry northeast winters, my skin usually becomes dry, itchy and flaky.  I have tried many products to help relieve this, and this Eucerin Wash Oil is by far the best.  It cleans well and leaves my skin moisturized and feeling great.</li>
    <li> When the process of aging occurs, one&#x27;s skin dries out. This body soap adds back some of the oils that the aging process removes and keeps my skin soft and suppl.</li>
    <li> I use this in place of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my extra long hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell great, but it works.</li>
    <li> I use this to wash my hair which is very thick and naturally curly.  I leave it on for about 30 minutes then rinse.  I do not require a conditioner.  The 6 pack available on Amazon is a good value compared to purchasing this in stores, and I haven&#x27;t found a lot of stores that carry this.  It is also very nice for washing your skin.  It doesn&#x27;t lather and is thick and creamy when applied and rinses clean, not oily.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed softer skin, or relief in eczema but, this stuff is better than anything else in the world to shave with! Really! Its not foamy and doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but it is so wonderful while shaving. Also usually my razor gets icky with dead skin or hair or w/e then you have to knock out the gook, well this stuff stops that build up from forming. All you have to do it rinse it quickly once in a while. I don&#x27;t get razor burn or cut myself so I am not sure how it works for that but I won&#x27;t shave with anything else again ever. BTW its not oily doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin or anything funky. Enjoy! Oh also if you really hate the smell add some essential or perfume oil to it! Or use body wash after, or man up! Lol :) but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on the skin.</li>
    <li> I first learned about Eucerin Skin Calming Body Wash Oil from a dermatologist. It&#x27;s very light, not oily at all. It&#x27;s great, especially in the winter when my skin is driest. It helps quite a bit!</li>
    <li> No smell and I love it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather at all and the smell is repulsive.  As far as the calming effect, I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the winter when my back was really dry and itchy. It was only available at Walmart and Amazon. Now it is only available at Amazon. I think it works. I buy it over and over. There&#x27;s no big foamy soap suds, but it feels nice and has calmed my itchy back. Don&#x27;t forget to shake it before using.</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. I use it all year long but love it for my dry winter skin. I even use it to wash off my makup</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. It really helps her reduce dry and itchy skin. I have it on &amp;#34;subscribe and save&amp;#34; so I save even more.</li>
    <li> Eucerin can be kind of expensive but this product is totally worth it.  Great for replenishing the skin, especially during new york winter months :)</li>
    <li> I Love the eucerin body bath oil.  It helps my extremely dry itchy skin and I would highly recommend this for those with dry skin</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I really like this product.  We both have year around dry skin and this product really helps.  We use it  exclusively for bathing, and always take a bottle with us when we travel.  It is a little strange smelling but the scent does not linger. It&#x27;s a must have in our household.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Calming Body Wash is great for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great to keep my daughters eczema under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;she has been using this product for 3 years.</li>
    <li> This product works as indicated.  It feels like you&#x27;re cleaning yourself with bacon-fat, but it washes away clean.  I bought the 3-pack, and have only used around 1/4 bottle in a month.  That is to say, you can use this very sparingly and get a lot of mileage.  I gave one bottle to my wife, which she promptly returned citing a bad smell.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell since it doesn&#x27;t exist after you wash it off.  In the winter months, when all moisture is sucked out of my life by heinous HVAC units and windchill factors, a product like this is instrumental in keeping me at a normal skin baseline.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the money.  Baby oil works better.</li>
    <li> Works good for dry skin, however, it does not suds up well. I had to use 3-5 times more than my other body washes to get it to suds up. Smells bad too.</li>
    <li> Always wonderful!  It is a great product.  If you have dry skin and lotion does not seem to be enough, this is what you need.  I use it everyday as well as a good body cream.  It helps makes my skin healthy and moisturized.  No body cream alone was able to help me.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and love it</li>
    <li> good!  have very dry skin and this is great especially in winter</li>
    <li> I use it to relieve dry skin  and itching.  It some times is sold out at the stores, when I saw it on amazon I was thrilled.  No more looking for it at the stores.</li>
    <li> I think if they find a way to give this product a fresh scent without changing its formula, then it&#x27;ll be perfect. It works well. It works extremely well. In fact, of all the products that I&#x27;ve bought for my dry skin, I think this by far has had the best results. But I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It just smells like scentless oil. So, it doesn&#x27;t leave me with that &#x27;clean&#x27; scent that I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;d still recommend it though.</li>
    <li> This product works well to reduce itching, but it literally smells like fish. If you are desperate, I would try it, but you will be stinky!</li>
    <li> This body wash actually works quite well. I have severe eczema and most body washes make it worse, but this helped clear it up a lot. The only downside to this product is the smell, but you get used to it and it doesn&#x27;t linger after you wash the product off.</li>
    <li> Have loved this for years. Just can&#x27;t find it locally.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for those who live in the arid part of this county.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s perfect for dry, sensitive skin and leaves you feeling clean and moisturised!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this as a daily shower gel, and I have to say it has helped my skin in this dry winter weather.</li>
    <li> Anyone with a strong sense of smell will definitely notice an odor.  I have a very sensitive nose, and I find the smell very objectionable.  I also found that it did not lather up well in hard water.  I prefer Cetaphil Restoraderm, Skin Restoring Body Wash, Formulated For Eczema</li>
    <li> I really love how this Body Wash Oil makes my skin feel, but it has a somewhat unpleasant smell. It reminds me of fish or castor oil. I&#x27;m going to try to add some essential oil to the bottle to ameliorate the odor.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time.It does exactly as advertised.Good product:</li>
    <li> Soooo.... Here&#x27;s the deal... The smell is not fantastic....but neither you nor your bathroom will be left smelling like it for long. I used the first bottle without adding anything into it and not one person complained that I smelled! I mix my wash oil with lavender oil now and it covers up the original smell just fine. This lathers... but more like a bar soap lather....not a traditional body wash. It cleanses well. It removes deodorant residue which is always a concern of mine.  I had found that using a bath puff works the best and working it into my skin as I would any other oil leaves me with the most benefits. I have extremely dry, flaking skin and this helps tremendously! Also, while this conditions skin while cleansing, it does not interfere with my body lotion. When it is time for me to exfoliate for the week, I mix this with plain white sugar and go to town! Please don&#x27;t let the SMELL issue sway you...this stuff is awesome for dry skin!</li>
    <li> Really helped my son&#x27;s skin clear up! You only have to use a little bit to wash the entire body, so it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> This oil is fragrance free which is what I love most about it. I have sensitive and dry skin and this product is amazing.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist to stop dry skin itchiness and discomfort. This is the only product I use in the shower. It is a wonderful product that goes everywhere with me, trips long or short.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found this winter that has cured my dry, itching skin. It was hard to find here in my town. So I ordered a 3-pack from Amazon. It is a wonderful product! I recommend it for anyone who cannot find a product to use every day for dry skin. I use the Eucerin Calming lotion, too. It has menthol so it soothes the skin after showering.</li>
    <li> It really helped my dry skin. I tried cetaphil, aveeno, and many other products. I was not pleased. I use it daily in the shower. Bye bye dry skin</li>
    <li> I have a sample bottle (received from my dermatologist&#x27;s office) sitting on my medicine cabinet for years.  I decided to try it one day and I was sold.  My skin used to itch in the winter from the cold/dry air and taking long hot showers.  This not only stop the itch, it also make my skin feel so smooth, like a baby&#x27;s skin.  I decided to pour some into all of my hand soap dispenser in my bathroom/kitchen sinks.  No more dry hands.  The smell is different but I don&#x27;t mind because I definitely do not want the stinking perfume that can triggers my allergies/asthma.  The smell will not bother you as long as you dont over do it.  Just a drop or two and mix it with your favorite body wash... and the result is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Everything&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Could be a little bit foamier.  Wish it comes in a pump or a better dispensing bottle.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested this product, so I ordered it immediately.  Glad I did - no more dry, winter skin for me!</li>
    <li> This Eucerin calming body wash is exactly that!  It calms dry itchy skin!  I had some samples from the Dermatologist, and when I tried it for the first time, well it was heaven..It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin with excess soappy feeling and the natural oils are so comforting and soft on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount to bring a soapy lather so it is cost effective.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Several reviewers said they noted a &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34; odor. When we tried the wash in our fingers, we did not smell anything. However, when my wife tried it on her hands in a larger quantity, she noticed a strong odor. She wouldn&#x27;t try it, but I did. There is an odor, but in my opinion it isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;fishy&amp;#34;. It is more like a nutty wood like smell. I used it in the shower, and although it feels really &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;, it effectively all rinses off. My wife says it left no noticeable odor behind.(OK .. she sniffed me). So I think I&#x27;ll use up what we have since I am running low on shower wash anyway, and it does seem to make the skin a bit smoother. If you are &amp;#34;eeeeow&amp;#34; about smells, then don&#x27;t use this. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll order this again when it is finished.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how this is at calming dry, sensitive skin because I can&#x27;t use it.  Bought the three pack and it will all be a waste.  I hate throwing it out, but it smells like fish guts - lightly but strong enough that my whole shower stunk, and persistently.  Blech.</li>
    <li> Works as Dr. Oz said it would. Soothing to irritated skin, doesn&#x27;t dry skin out. Walmarts carry it now so you can buy it locally too.&lt;br /&gt;My doctor just recommended ConvaTec Aloe Vesta body wash, shampoo and lotion. Works much better for seriously irritated skin. That is also available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Best thing for eczema</li>
    <li> My husband has dry itchy skin &amp; this is the only product that has changed how his skin feels in the winter. Great product!</li>
    <li> Gross smell!!! Too nasty to use! I don&#x27;t care if this body wash makes your skin feel like pure silk because its smells HORRIBLE!!! I tried putting a good smelling essential oil in the bottle to make it smell better but doesn&#x27;t help!!! Doesn&#x27;t smell like fish but I t smells worse!!</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive, itchy skin..  as well for eczema or psoriasis. My daughter and i like to use it for shaving as well. A nice soft coating on the skin gives a very smooth shave. You just need a little bit. I did not have a problem with any scent.</li>
    <li> I have super dry skin in the winter. This wash keeps my skin soft through the winter months. Hands and feet included!</li>
    <li> I have been using product for some time the best in body wash for me I would recommend to others</li>
    <li> This is a great product, make your skin so soft .  My skin was so dry but using this product my skin is nice and softOnly sing this product a few weeks but I won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
    <li> This product helps my husband with his dry skin an is no longer available locally.  He uses it every day.</li>
    <li> I live in PA and we&#x27;ve had a really tough winter.  I am so dried out and was desperate for a solution.  I felt like regular moisturizers weren&#x27;t helping at all.  This cleanser is awesome.  Some viewers complained about a smell, I don&#x27;t notice one at all. My skin is so smooth afterwards.  I&#x27;m also love the pool in the summer and plan on using this so I won&#x27;t get dried out from the chlorine.  It does give a warning about slipping in the tub after using--heed it.</li>
    <li> Eucerin  does exactly what it claims it does, rinses off easy and leaves light film making my skin softer never dry or itchy. I am very happy with the product.  I found it by acident, a friend gave me a bag of samples to try this cold dry winter, then I just had to find were to purchase me some.</li>
    <li> llego en perfecto estado y rapido, quisiera saber si puedo resibir ofertas del vendedor directamente para comprar mas rapido, en estos dias seguire conprando sus productos.</li>
    <li> Soak my feet in it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product after my dermatologist gave me a free sample.  It keeps my eczema under control by not drying out my hands.  I also use this occasionally on my hair.  I find that it nourishes my hair and leaves it soft and very manageable.  Also, it helps to control dandruff and dry skin during cold dry spells.  I cannot say enough good things about the product.  I suspect it would make a great wash for a baby as well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for extra dry skin.</li>
    <li> I found this in a grocery store once but is hard to find at the other stores in my city. I decided to look for it online and stock up because I love this for my overly sensitive skin. I have hand eczema and have to take extra care in choosing soaps. This stuff doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema and it moisturises my skin overall. I used to put baby oil in the bath but it made the tub oily and required extra cleanings to remove the oil, which re-irritated my skin. So this was a solution to that problem.</li>
    <li> I cannot find this product in my area and was so glad to know I could get it at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, itchy, scaley, etc. This product used in daily bathes does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
    <li> Best I have found for my dry skin . No fragrance but you could probably add es if you wanted to. You wil stil need a moisturizer after but doesn&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this product, however it&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I need. It&#x27;s pleasant to use however I still need to apply a moisturizing lotion after my shower as I have very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I swim a lot so this is the just the thing for dry skin in winter after coming out of the pool. highly recommend. good price got three medium size perfect for travel bag</li>
    <li> I have really itchy skin. This is the only bath product I have ever found that helps calm my skin. My Derm also recommends it.</li>
    <li> The only soap that doesn&#x27;t dry me out worse than I already am. No odor, low suds, Would NOT recommend using with a bath sponge. I use it without any scrubbing device, just rub on my body along with water.</li>
    <li> This is far superior to the regular body wash people usually buy such as Dove Brands.  This leaves your skin so silky smooths it&#x27;s incredible.  I don&#x27;t even have dry skin and i&#x27;ll use this for as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> Great for dry skin or if you shaved too closely!  (Like underarms).  The oily cream lathers into soap!  It is great!</li>
    <li> All Good ... Recommended ...</li>
    <li> This product was mentioned on Dr. Oz. I tried it and i am so happy that it has controlled my dry \\&quot;itchy skin\\&quot;. I also use the Calming Lotion, but not every day. I find the Shower Oil really des the job for me. Good product. Flo Price (Amazon makes purchasing so easy).</li>
    <li> This stuff has been wonderful on my skin. The way I relax after a busy day of work is I take a long hot bath, (while read my kindle). Because of this habit my skin gets dry and itchy. I didn&#x27;t want to give up my baths, so I&#x27;m so glad I found this. I fill the tub. Get wet, put a couple squirts of this on a mesh sponge and scrub down with it. Then relax in tub. It is like a cleaning that pretreated my skin with moisture. I have been able to keep my relaxation routine, now without the itching hours later.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;scent free&lt;br /&gt;Great moisture&lt;br /&gt;Cleans great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does leave a lite oil film on tub (I&#x27;ll gladly clean it)&lt;br /&gt;Hard to find in my city ( so I do Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save).</li>
    <li> In the winter time in a cold climate, this body wash really helps keep my old skin from itching so much.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for year round use for sensitive skin folks as it adds a little oil to your skin when you shower.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my aesthetician for dry itchy skin.  This product is great and I use it year round.  I almost never have itchy skin anymore and my skin looks healthy and feels soft from using.  It does not lather up like regular soap and it does not have any chemicals to make it smell pretty...but, it cleans well and leaves behind no residue or scent on my skin.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing; I have used this product (based on a Dr. Oz episode) for a while now (on my 4th bottle).  I like that it comes in a 3-pack so you don&#x27;t run out so quickly, and it does calm my old skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since last November.  It works better than most other dry skin body washes or soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t smell that great, but it does it&#x27;s job and is really soothing come mid winter dry flares ups.</li>
    <li> works great on dry sensitive kids skin, helps clear up execema.</li>
    <li> I got this for my 4 year old because he has dry skin and I&#x27;ll try anything.  This really does help.  This has really helped my dry skin, too.</li>
    <li> Excellent for my dry skin. This is a staple now for me. I love it!!</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully!  I wish they had a natural scent option that could take away the natural oil scent.  Otherwise, it is great.  It lathers, washes, and leaves skin very moisturized.  Also, the scent of the oil in it does fade away after washing with it.</li>
    <li> I sure don&#x27;t know where reviewers are getting their theory that Eucerin Calming Body Wash oil has fish oil in it.  It does not.  Here are the ingredients, as listed on Eucerin&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycine Soja (Soybean Oil), MIPA-Laureth Sulfate, Ricinus Communis (Castor) Seed Oil, Laureth-4, Cocamide DEA, Poloxamer 101, Laureth-9, Lanolin Alcohol, Water, Citric Acid, Diammonium Citrate, Propyl Gallate, BHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, there is a faint oily smell, which is gone by the time I rinse and dry off. I do not like perfumes of any kind in my soap, dish soap or laundry detergent. This has none. It leaves my skin feeling very clean, with none of the drying residue left by most soaps and even many shower washes.  There is also no &#x27;oily&#x27; feeling on my skin after drying.  Just clean, soft skin.  I tend to have dry skin, especially in winter, and this soap has helped immensely.  I&#x27;m on Amazon today to buy a 3-pak to keep it stocked. The bottle I have has lasted about 8 months, so it goes a long way. I shouldn&#x27;t need to buy more for a couple of years.</li>
    <li> My son has eczema and his doctor recommended this for his baths. So far it has been pretty good for helping some but its not the end all.</li>
    <li> First tried a sample from my dermatologist. Great stuff, and reasonably priced. Figure out how long 3 bottles last and sign up for a subscription.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s gentle and great as a mild cleanser. I have severe eczema and its nice to use this with minimal burning like other soaps. However, the odor it has is due to the castor oil in it. Some people can tolerate castor oil on their skin others can&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s unbearable.  My husband and I thought we could handle it until it came in contact with the warm water and the smell just amplified. We couldnt help but laugh at how ridiculously awful the smell got to be.Too bad, though, it&#x27;s such a great concept.</li>
    <li> My son gets very dry skin every winter and we always use this product.  Not greasy and leaves his skin soft.  Have found that with the right deal the best price is on Amazon as opposed to the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Really a nice item.  I didn&#x27;t procure this cleanser because I have an issue with sensitive or skin that needs to be calmed.  I procured this because I needed a cleanser that I can add to my sugar scrubs items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice and I don&#x27;t think anyone will be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t like to use harsh soaps. I also try to avoid artificial chemicals. This kills two birds with one stone- I get clean, moisturized skin, without having to do a separate moisturizer (which I usually forget). My skin feels soft and silky since I started using this. it does have a weird smell, but it&#x27;s not bad, just weird. Smells kind of like vitamin e pills. I prefer that to artificial fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have skin allergies and this is safe and keeps my skin hydrated.  Always happy with this product.  My only draw back is it tends to spill down the side of the bottle and make the shower a little messy or always leaks when you try to travel with it.  This is the product in general, not due to the sender.</li>
    <li> I love it.  It can also be used for removing make-up products on your skin.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t expect a lot of rich, foamy lather with this product. It works best to drizzle about 1/8 tsp in a circle on a body puff or wash cloth. A little goes a long way, 2 or 3 cycles is enough for the whole body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About that smell: while Eucerin is indeed *fragrance* free, it&#x27;s not 100% *odor* free. The mild scent definitely isn&#x27;t floral or perfume-y. I find it vaguely herbal, but can understand why some might not be thrilled with it. More important to me, it rinses off completely even in our soft water and leaves skin smelling like ... clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half a star deducted for the bottle design. Even though only a few drops are needed at a time, the flip-top cap wastes about 25% of the product in every dispense. We decant into a proper squeeze bottle like the [[ASIN:B002VS8H3G Humangear GoToob Travel Bottle]], or a plain old [[ASIN:B000QJBNII condiment dispenser]].</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t call me crazy... but during the winter or when facing the sunlight I sometimes get this pricky feeling where it&#x27;s like a bunch of needles poking at my skin. This occurs on my arms, back, chest and back. If you google it you will find what I&#x27;m taking about. But, allot of people seem that they cannot put a name on this weird feeling, or doctors don&#x27;t really know what it is. I suppose it&#x27;s a rare condition and not many people get it. If you get the annoying feeling that occurs spontaneously and last for a coupe second to minutes, you know what I&#x27;m taking about. Otherwise everyone else always thinks I&#x27;m a crazy psychopath (..but googling the problem you will see others have this problem in the heat, sun, or winter too... so I&#x27;m not crazy), Anyways I wanted to let those crazy people like myself know that this body-wash does help with the problem. Years I&#x27;ve been searching for a solution to my needle like pain and again doctors can&#x27;t really diagnose it.. but this body wash definitely helps. I almost think it&#x27;s a extreme case of dry skin, but my skin doesn&#x27;t look dry or when I use lotion I still get the pain. Anyways, this body wash helps with this condition and minimizes it decently. I use to get this pricky feeling daily and when using the body wash I only get it a couple times a week. It has been the only product to really help with the problem and minimize the pain.</li>
    <li> Received a small sample bottle from the Dermatologist and liked the product.  Amazon had the best price!</li>
    <li> Bought for my mom who has psoriasis and she is very grateful I found this. This doesn&#x27;t get rid of the problem but it soothes the itchiness. Usually a shower would leave her skin very dry and she would have to slather on lotion, she has only had to reach for the lotion one time post shower since using this product.</li>
    <li> Big fan of this product. I have always dealt with extremely sensitive skin and atopic dermatitis/eczema. After moving to Colorado I have had to really revamp my skincare routine to compensate for the total lack of moisture in the air. I work in a dermatology clinic, so I tried samples of this and was instantly hooked! The &amp;#34;fishy smell&amp;#34; people have mentioned does bother me a little bit (on the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t leave behind any discernable scent after rinsing), but our Eucerin rep gave me some advice that has really made using this a pleasure. She suggested that I add a few drops of an essential oil to the bottle. It totally works! Negates the somewhat unpleasant smell AND I still get the amazing, skin-softening effects of this product. Obviously proceed with caution if you have sensitive skin- some people cannot tolerate even the most gentle organic essential oils, but my skin is insanely sensitive and this has not caused any issues for me. All-around great product.</li>
    <li> excellent for the dry skin that comes with the cold temps and a must to keep on hand--would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I understand the smell critique, but I would choose this type of scent over something perfume-y.  The texture is nice, but you don&#x27;t get much lather, so if that&#x27;s important I&#x27;d choose something else.  I use this with a pouf and find that it&#x27;s made a difference for the skin on the backs of my arms which tends to get dry and rough.</li>
    <li> My husband has a skin condition that causes him to be itchy (not eczema).  He started to use this in place of Dove and it&#x27;s been a big help!  Highly recommend trying it out.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! If you get dry irritated skin, I highly recommend this! took away the irritation, I still have to use lotion but that is probably cause I live in the desert so it is very dry and hot and the AC adds to the dryness!</li>
    <li> First tried it on my son who has severe eczema from samples the doctor gave us.  It works excellent for him and I also have my daughter using now as well who has had eczema since she was a baby.  What I do for my son is I use this in his bath or shower( he is 2) then I use vaseline and Eucerin lotion together all over his body when he gets out. It keeps his skin moisturized and from getting the dry patches.  Of course he still gets some patches every once in awhile and I will put his prescription cream on those spots.</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after a shower when I use this product.  No more dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> I shower a lot and previously used baby oil to try to prevent dry skin, but hated the smell of most baby oil products and ended up just feeling greasy and the tub becoming dangerously slippery.  I&#x27;ve been now using Eucerin Skin Calming Dry Skin Body Wash for about 2 years and think it is the best anti-dry skin body wash on the market.  Forget the nonsense about it smelling \\&quot;bad\\&quot; or like fish.  It does not.  An added \\&quot;plus\\&quot; is that a bottle is long-lasting.  You do *not* have to slather yourself silly with the stuff.  This stuff is good, good, good!  I was skeptical after having tried so many different body washes and thinking I had to settle on baby oil, but as I noted, I&#x27;ve been a loyal user for over 2 years now.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty cool product.  It is a wash OIL so it feels a bit different, but it great for dryer skin!</li>
    <li> If you suffer from chronic eczema as I do then you will find this product very soothing when used on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the smell is strange.</li>
    <li> Eucerin Body Wash does a good job on cleaning the body.  I have really dry skin.  This doesn&#x27;t dry out my body and it make my skin feel such better.</li>
    <li> It certainly has a smell, but not that bad.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  I have very dry skin and this has helped immensely!!!!</li>
    <li> My wife uses this and she will be ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> Great value compared to retail. Works great. Recommended by pediatrician and only body wash we use for our son who has itchiness from dry skin. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my soap in the shower in the winter to keep my skin soft and moisturized. it only takes a quarter sized amount.</li>
    <li> I used this body wash once, but found that I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference obviously for the one time that I used it, but I can imagine that this body wash works well since my body didn&#x27;t have that feeling of extreme dryness it usually did after the shower.</li>
    <li> My friend gave me a sample. It worked great so I ordered more. It&#x27;s been a bad dry winter and this helps. I would normally scratch my legs until their raw (even when i put cream on). A big thumbs up!</li>
    <li> This wash works great for my skin.  I sometimes have eczema breakouts and it soothes the uncomfortable rash.  Many reviewers wrote of a funny/fish smell, and I didn&#x27;t notice anything like that at all.  It has no smell as far as I can tell.</li>
    <li> This was my first buy this but it had awfulness smell to me but I got several bottles. I love the other products they have. This one, not to please. Sorry</li>
    <li> Eucerin is the best product overall for skin care. My dermatologist who seemed to know very little but then was on roller skates and had no time to talk (what&#x27;s new?), recommended another skin product. Who knows why but for the likelihood that she is paid to do so by the manufacturer who visits her with &amp;#34;gifts.&amp;#34; This is better than soap products and at first feels less clean than soap but then one gets used to it...There is a very little soap in the oil compound contained therein. Use sparingly, lasts me a month or so...one shower daily. DO NOT RINSE OR SHOWER WITH HOT WATER.</li>
    <li> This body wash is a life saver if you need help with dry skin.  I highly recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> This has really cleared up my infants eczema and has even helped my skin get a little glow to it but it smells just like fish oil.  Once we lotion up it&#x27;s fine but it almost turns my stomach as we are washing up.</li>
    <li> My family uses this product since it has come out. It works very well for people who have psoriasis and or sensitive skin. Excellent for a child or baby that wont stop itching!</li>
    <li> I buy this body wash oil frequently!  This helps to soften my skin.  I would recommend this if you suffer from dry skin!</li>
    <li> In my seemingly never ending search for a body wash that does not dry out my ultra sensitive skin I have run through all the conventional brands found in stores: Aveeno, Olay, Dove, Nivea for Men, and all of them left my skin lacking the moisture that someone with very sensitive and dry skin, who lives in the climate that I do (New England) needs. Finally I stumbled upon this body wash by Eucerin, which I had never seen before or even knew existed. I noticed that it was more oil based and was free of fragrances, dyes and other harsh chemicals companies add to their body washes. I had to give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it, I made the mistake of using a loofa as I always have. This body wash does not get along with loofas or sponges as the amount it lathers is practically nil (this is a very good thing). The only effective way I find to use this is to always shake it well and use your hands. It is also worth nothing that you really do not need to use a lot of this stuff to cleanse yourself. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;3\\&quot; and in total I need no more than 12-16 little drops to wash my whole body. If you come from the world of body washes that give you nice, plentiful bubbles and lather like I did, leave that behind when using this stuff and you will see that the bubbles are only psychologically satisfying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A number of people seem to take issue with the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; of this product and note a fishy odor. I take fish oil pills on a daily basis and I don&#x27;t smell the resemblance. If anything it is about as neutral of a smell as you can get - earthy, slightly nutty, and oily. While some may complain, in order for them to make this product have virtually no smell whatsoever they would have to add fragrance chemicals to eliminate the scent... no thanks. Personally, I enjoy the smell and its lingering for a short while after the shower - something very pleasant about its earthiness. This product also rinses remarkably clean for something that is oil-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far my skin has never felt softer after getting out of the shower and my dry skin itches and red patches have healed and are eliminated. Even with the harsh cold my area has been experiencing the past few days (wind chills bringing the temp down to 0° F), I haven&#x27;t felt itchy whatsoever since I started using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. I have never seen it in stores where I live but luckily this price on Amazon is very reasonable and a 3-pack would last you an insanely long time. I believe Eucerin&#x27;s website offers trial bottles as well if you are skeptical before buying. Try it out.has never felt softer after getting out of the shower and my dry skin itches and red patches have healed and are eliminated.

    <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if it came in a larger container and it had a pump.  But this stuff, once you get past the soybean smell, is a great gentle cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel stripped of moisture.  Been using it for a few years and always in winter.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much. I don&#x27;t understand all the raves.</li>
    <li> Works ok but the fragrance is a turnoff for me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product that is soothing to itchy, dry skin especially in this weather.  Easy to use and it lasts a good time.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how other reviewers said this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell!  It&#x27;s not appealing, at all.  It smells like fish oil, even though there is not any in the ingredients.  However, it really does calm my skin.  I have a pretty gnarly case of Keratosis on my arms and this stuff makes it manageable.  Maybe I&#x27;ll add some kind of essential oil in there to make it smell nor pleasant.</li>
    <li> Best ever for shaving legs!</li>
    <li> Meets my requirements for a non allergic shower oil that keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 bottles of this body wash for my daughter, who is in the military serving overseas where she&#x27;s exposed to the elements (not to mention danger). She complains about not being able to get anything locally to use in bathing except soap, which dries her skin. She searched online and found Eucerin, which I ordered for her. I had to have the product sent to me because Amazon cannot ship to an overseas APO. My daughter says--by Skype--that she loves the product and I&#x27;ll probably order more when she runs out.</li>
    <li> Eucerin is a great product!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for dry skin and any other kind for that matter. Best used in the bath as it will leave a residue on glass shower doors and it might be a bit slippery in the shower depending upon your shower type. All and all though an excellent product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I think this product will be good for my skin, I&#x27;ve been using it and while there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;improvement,&amp;#34; I believe it&#x27;s better than perfume-y bodywashes. I don&#x27;t like that there&#x27;s minimal lather and it does smell bad (while you&#x27;re using it, no clinging smell. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again after my trio runs out.</li>
    <li> The product has very unpleasant smell, I am not happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Our pediatrician recommended this to help clear up our sons eczema. He has environmental allergy eczema. We&#x27;ve tried so many other products and this is the only one we&#x27;ve come by that keeps his skin nearly eczema free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find it locally so we do subscribe and save via Amazon and its been great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The matching lotion is great too.</li>
    <li> this does not lather up like a soap, kinda like a baby oil with a little lather.  i just pour it in my hand and rub rub rub.. it does not leave you greasy or oily feeling.. it leaves you soft.  it does have a sort of weird scent out of the bottle, but you dont smell it on you skin....  i love it and use it every other shower.</li>
    <li> Perfect soap for my son who has eczema. It relieves him of his problem. Published 8 days ago by PHILLIP ORDONA LAPID</li>
    <li> This is the best wash for delicate skin - really does calm irritated skin! No soap and no layer of leftover soap after rinsing.  Works on face without causing breakouts.  I&#x27;ve tried everything out there from the upper end of easily available products only to go back and order more of this.</li>
    <li> I have Eczema, and therefore I have severe dry skin. This affects me mostly during the Winter, and it gets really itchy. No amount of body butters and lotions in the world would do sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;This thing just saved me. I love it. I am so pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;The night after the first use, my skin was so smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to use body butters and lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this.</li>
    <li> This product works as expected -- NOT amazing but not horrible.  Other liquid soaps work just a well without the oily feel of this one.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the oily feel FEEL good in the shower and absorbs away quickly (like other after shower body oils).  Some complain about the smell - really?  YES, the soap smell some while in the bottle and SURE it does not smell like fresh berry, but come-on, this is made primarily for people who have skin issues - the last thing you want to do is add scent chemical to your skin.  So, yes, it smell not delicious, but not horrible and certainly not when you are washing your body or out of the shower.  It only smell if you inhale the air in the bottle.</li>
    <li> it came very thin, like someone had watered it down and did not lather much or feel clean</li>
    <li> Best kind for super dry skin, sometimes it is very hard to find</li>
    <li> This product is great.  It really does leave one&#x27;s skin feeling much softer and better hydrated.  In addition, if you prefer not to have a highly fragranced bath lotion, this is the one for you.  Once again, the price offered through Amazon is quite good.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product, kinda watery and doesn&#x27;t foam real well plus no nice smell, in fact no smell which is what the label states so that&#x27;s on me,&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works as advertised, will use it but not sure I will order it again</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to say how horrible I found this product to be.  How it could get any positive ratings is beyond me.  It smells really terrible, it is very thin/watery (it took quite a bit to get any suds), and my skin felt much drier and itchier than when I&#x27;ve used any other body wash.  I sent one of the three bottles I purchased to my daughter since she also has dry sensitive skin.  Her sentiments were the same as mine.  I hate to throw out my third unused bottle, but I wouldn&#x27;t wish this stuff on anybody.  I love other Eucerin products and was shocked at how bad this was.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Perfect for my skin,  nice conservative natural clean scent.  I will always buy this product.</li>
    <li> wife has issue with dry skin. says this really helps</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a doctor and it works. They also have a skin calming lotion to supplement. Both: worth buying and relatively inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Wife loves this stuff!</li>
    <li> My fiancé loves this. I don&#x27;t like the smell but it works.</li>
    <li> Seems that when both my husband &amp; I hit a certain age, our skin did a 360 &amp; now requires more &amp;#34;special handling&amp;#34; than in the past.  This product does what it says it will do.  It was recommended to us by our Dermatologist &amp; we are in agreement...it works!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t quite expect the feeling... It is like bathing in cod liver oil... It smells horrible.  I can&#x27;t say I know its overall effect as I couldn&#x27;t bath in it long enough to say how well it works</li>
    <li> This stuff if great for kid that cant use Johnson &amp; Johnson or Aveeno.Its a little more expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> can not live with out it!</li>
    <li> I got it at first for my mother who had such dry skin it was flaking off in sheets. I had used every product out there and this made a world of difference; so much so I started using it on myself. As others have said it does not lather like most body wash products so I put it on after moistening and put it on with my hands as using other things may cause more irritation. If you have dry skin you will love, love , love it</li>
    <li> Best oil wash I have ever used.</li>
    <li> First please note this is a body wash oil so it is not nearly as thick as traditional body washes.  I also hope you don&#x27;t mind the smell which thankfully does not seem to stay on you.  It is from the Omega 3 and I really can&#x27;t decide if it is fish or kelp.  Either way not very appealing.  The lather also leaves something to be desired so I find myself using quite a bit more.  I use the Axe body detailer and the wash seems to run through the poofy sponge part.  Might be better with a regular wash cloth.  Last winter my legs were extremely dry and itchy and so far this winter with the change to this wash I have not had any issues.  I will definitely update my review if that changes.</li>
    <li> I tend to love aromatic body washes (think [[ASIN:B00O19ROBE Philosophy Iced Gingerbread Cookie Duo]]).  Unfortunately, my skin doesn&#x27;t love them.  It&#x27;s problematically sensitive, especially in the wintertime.  My skin often feels dry and tight and is incredibly itchy.  At its worst it makes it hard for me to fall asleep at night because I&#x27;m scratching and scratching. My doctor suggested I skip the heavily perfumed, sudsy body washes and try something more gentle and geared toward my skin type instead.  I decided to try this because I&#x27;ve had good experiences with other Eucerin products in the past for my dry and sensitive skin and also because my dermatologist&#x27;s office offered a sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really impressed with this body wash.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure, but it does seem to cut down on how itchy and irritated my skin feels.  I will agree with other reviewers that I don&#x27;t think it is the most moisturizing product out there, but I buy it more for the calming effect than for the moisture.  Between showering less frequently, avoiding scalding hot water when I do shower, using [[ASIN:B008ATIGTA bliss High Intensity 24-Heaven Healing Body Balm, 8 oz.]], and using this body wash, I do feel like I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in the irritation and sensitivity of my skin.  Those who are sensitive to smells will also appreciate that it is fragrance free and has only a mild scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this product is consistent with the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from Eucerin.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle cure, but as part of a solid skincare routine I&#x27;ve found it does help the health of my skin.</li>
    <li> I originally ended up with this product because my niece uses it on her 1 year old daughter because of sensitive skin.  I did notice an odd smell which to me smelled slightly fishy but once lathered was gone.  Forgot to pack it up after watching her for the night so it&#x27;s sitting in the tub.  I figure I have dry and sensitive skin so why not, right?  I like to experiment so I put a line on my left wet arm and rub to slight lather and spread to my chest then rinse.  Sure, I noticed an immediate difference after drying off.  The best way I can describe would be that my skin where it was used felt more like my 1 year old great-niece&#x27;s skin than, oh, say my right arm.&lt;br /&gt;Next day at work after the first few hour rush, I take a moment to talk to a co-worker and happen to place my right hand on my left arm and realized it STILL felt smooth and tender as compared to my left arm.  Haven&#x27;t had any rash or adverse reaction so far, so right now I highly recommend if you are having skin problems.  I will update this review should I have any negative effects. (Four stars because of the smell. While \\&quot;fragrance-free\\&quot; I can see where people would not be able to get past it.)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I was worried about the smell other reviewers report but I never notice any smell.  Third time to order.</li>
    <li> I use it virtually on a daily basis.  When I start to feel itchy using soap or standard body wash, especially during winter time, I switch to this body wash oil. My skin no longer feels dry and itchy after use.</li>
    <li> I am so sad about this product, because as a person with very dry skin and a respect for the brand, I was really looking forward to trying it. Unfortunately, it has a distinctly fishy smell, like fish oil supplements. I tried to get used to it, and even tried adding an essential oil to mask the smell, but it didn&#x27;t work. Happily the smell didn&#x27;t linger on my skin, but I couldn&#x27;t face that stomach-churning smell every morning.</li>
    <li> Very good at cleaning and maintaining skin condition. I have very dry skin and this product has been a godsend.  No scent beyond a slight oil one which is because it is oil based. Used to have dry flaking skin  - no more. Great product.</li>
    <li> My kids suffer from eczema, and this product is the only one I can trust will not cause them to damage their already sensitive skin. My youngest recently contracted impetigo, and the product worked wonders on his itchy and raw skin.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin...my dermatologist recommended Eucerin products and I was delighted to find a line of products for every area needed...face, body, and hair! Not all the products can be found at Wal-Mart, Walgreen, or Target, but I did find all on Amazon.com in small or large quantities. Completely recommend!</li>
    <li> My son doesn&#x27;t  itch no more because of this product</li>
    <li> Ok I have been using the eucerin skin calming lotion for some time and after I went on vacation and the water their wrecked havoc on my skin I went and picked this up at a local drugstore. Wow! I thought this would be like washing with olive oil or something, it was not, it is moisturizing cleans great, I loved it so much I came here to Amazon found this great price and went ahead and ordered so that when I got back home from vacation it would be waiting for me! Thanks Amazon for such great prices you bring !</li>
    <li> A terrific body wash even if your dry skin is very mild like mine. Helps avoid the need for lotion or cream.</li>
    <li> Perfect for all skin types--especially those with Keratosis Pilaris.  I have sensitive skin with KP and no tolerance for fragrance/perfumes--this is my secret weapon for supple skin without heavy/overpriced products.</li>
    <li> Good product. dDes all it claims. Soothing and not oily, and thankfully fragrance free.Soaps easily, and easy to handle in the shower.</li>
    <li> There was little to no lather.  I have a serious aversion to germs.  And in my mind I need suds to be clean.  It felt like showering with nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 bottles so I&#x27;ll pass the 2 unopened bottles to an older woman friend that has eczema. She has crepe paper thin skin that tears and bruises at the slightest touch.  I think it will be good for her eczema.</li>
