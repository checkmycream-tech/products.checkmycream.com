    <li> Lovely elegant piece, a bit too heavy but very solid. Need to watch out for the crystals falling out as after a little wear, especially in a humid weather, they may get loose.</li>
    <li> Great Buy, Outstanding product, Excellent packaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased every hair claw clip this seller has for purchase. I love them all!!! The quality of the clips are superb. I get so many compliments when I wear any of them. The stones are placed tightly and not cheaply. These clips are made to last, if you care for them nicely you can pass them down. I&#x27;ve shopped in many states and countries, and this seller has the best of the best!!! If you have long, then you&#x27;re looking in the right place. If your hair is short, then you may want to stick to the smaller of his showcase. Either way you go, you will not be disappointed. Again, I have purchased them all and they&#x27;re all beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is excellent!!</li>
    <li> This hair clip is beautiful for a wedding or just for going out, very classy looking and stays in without being too heavy.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this hair clip. I have been with her when she gets compliments from other women on it.</li>
    <li> This hair clip is very beautiful looking and grips tight. I like that because it helps keep my hair in place for hours.  And because it is made from metal, it will last longer that the plastic ones.</li>
    <li> It does look like the picture but was way smaller than I thought it was going to be.  My hair gets caught on the gems and pretty much guarantees it will pull at least a couple hairs whenever I wear it. It is a sturdy clip though. I probably won&#x27;t throw it away but I probably won&#x27;t use it like I would have liked either.  It&#x27;s just too small really (about 2\\&quot; long).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s horrible - there&#x27;s just nothing good about this.  The size is too big - it&#x27;s heavy and looks like a child should wear it.  Hard to capture the hideousness of this in the photo.</li>
    <li> Too heavy to be worn in the hair.  I had hoped they would be more comfortable but they pull down on the hair too much to be worn comfortably</li>
    <li> I have longer hair, so in Texas,  I wear it up a lot of the time, since it is windy here. These clips are simply the best! Made of metal, they hold tight, are easy to put in and take out, and I get compliments about them all the time.</li>
    <li> Beautiful clip.  Very well made.  A must have for your hair accessory collection.  It also holds your hair up really well.</li>
    <li> Way to big!!! And didn&#x27;t hold my hair, it kept slipping, maybe it was to heavy. I have long hair but it&#x27;s not very thick. But I still expected it to at least hold it up</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a bit shameful to say.  I do like shiny things.  this is  surely the bomb.  the seller listed a fair price for what it is and all.  i&#x27;m cool with the deal as a whole.  i hoped it would have been larger.  i&#x27;m sure that is my responsibility.  i&#x27;m happy to have found such a clip.  thnk u!!</li>
    <li> It is very pretty, but I do prefer the multi colored ones more. This is more for a fancy occasion I would think, not really for everyday wear.  Just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love this clip, it is very pretty and I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected.  Too small to grasp all my hair.  Very  pretty.  Does have a tight clasp.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my card club secret pal for Christmas.  She liked the one I gave her for her birthday...so made the Christmas gift idea easy.  Godd quality product.</li>
    <li> These are Beautiful hair clips, they are made strong and hold well, I have long hair and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else to clip my hair up with...Such Beautiful colors. Every where I go strangers stop and ask me, where did you get that hair clip.</li>
    <li> A lot smaller than expected.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and sturdy.  Have had many compliments from coworkers.</li>
