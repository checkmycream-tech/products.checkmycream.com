      <li>This product is great because you can apply just one coat and it completely covers your nails.  </li>
      <li>it stays on over a week and comes off fairly easy.</li>
      <li>I received it very quickly and it was packaged to perfection.</li>
      <li>Very pretty for the holidays!</li>
      <li>I have placed on nail by its self which gives it a light gold</li>
      <li>Very festive and eye catching.</li>
      <li>my new favorite!</li>
      <li>OPI makes great nail polish that lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Love the formula and dries pretty fast as well!!</li>
      <li>It came well wrapped and quickly.</li>
      <li>The packaging was well wrapped and the quality of the nailpolish is super pigmented.</li>
      <li>Very pretty, not a tacky gold color.</li>
      <li>This is SO pretty painted over gold nail polish!</li>
      <li>This stuff looks great if you want to spice it up a little, like for the holidays or for nights out.  </li>
      <li>Super friendly and fast shipping.</li>
      <li>overlarge flecks, just the right amount of sparkle without looking tacky.</li>
      <li>This polish is pure glitter fabulousness!</li>
      <li>Very festive!</li>
      <li>Thanks Mariah!</li>
      <li>or i place a color undercoat on before pretty both way</li>
      <li>My first cosmetic purchase on Amazon</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so pretty.</li>
      <li>I bought My Favorite Ornament to wear on its own and as second coat for other polishes.  </li>
      <li>It is best to use it along with base coat and top coat.</li>
      <li>Besides being glittery and pretty, it really protects your nails and does not chip off.</li>
      <li>It is a little more gold than i thought, BUT that being said, it lasts forever!</li>
      <li>The quality is stunning and lasts a very long time without chipping.</li>
      <li>I first saw this particular color on Ingrid Neilson from YouTube and knew I had to have it as well.</li>
      <li>This company makes really upgrade polish that applies so well and lasts very well.  </li>
      <li>that she will really go for this one.  </li>
      <li>it was very bumpy almost like a textured polish and needs atleast two coats of topcoat</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I hoped it was the real deal.</li>
      <li>Very sparkly.</li>
      <li>The application was easy and the polish lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not chunky and it has more glitter than other glitter polishes.</li>
      <li>I saw this on Pinterest and had to have it for New Year&#x27;s Eve.</li>
      <li>You do need to put a few top coats over it because it feels rough to the touch like sand.</li>
      <li>I only had to put on two layers and my nails were completely coated in sparkles.</li>
      <li>Only con is that it&#x27;s a little more difficult to remove with nail polish remover, but nothing that a little elbow grease couldn&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
      <li>The shimmer/glitter is just subtle enough to be pretty and not childish.</li>

    <li> Never thought if be a person with a signature color. I love this, it reminds me of like a Mercury glass type of color. Feminine but not overly glittery or teenish. I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I think it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> Literally got this nailpolish within three days!  The packaging was well wrapped and the quality of the nailpolish is super pigmented. Love it! :)</li>
    <li> Loved it! Wish it weren&#x27;t discontinued!</li>
    <li> Picture is not true to color and bottle shipped to me was not new &amp; sealed.</li>
    <li> The best--tons of glitter</li>
    <li> My first cosmetic purchase on Amazon and I hoped it was the real deal. And it was!!!! This is my favorite nail polish color. Not too gold, not straight silver, not overlarge flecks, just the right amount of sparkle without looking tacky. It applies nicely so you can fade it up the nail for a spectacular sparky ombré nail.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful polish color. It is in between a silver and gold and definitely looks like a Christmas ornament, which is what I was hoping. I only had to put on two layers and my nails were completely coated in sparkles. LOVE!</li>
    <li> I bought My Favorite Ornament to wear on its own and as second coat for other polishes.  It works beautifully in both cases. By itself, it&#x27;s a neutral with a twist. There are just enough sparkles and opacity to give solid appearance with 2 coats for standalone wear.  As top coat, it lets the first coat to peek through for a great effect on the nails.  Very festive!</li>
    <li> Great for a festive look with all gold nails OR just to add to colored nails... long lasting too! Will definitely stay stocked up on this.</li>
    <li> This Nail Lacquer is for sure the best I have ever used!! I got two colors--“make him mine” and &amp;#34;my favorite ornament&amp;#34;. They both go evenly on nails and look super cute and very gorgeous. It is best to use it along with base coat and top coat. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Perfect color glitter. I use this as an accent nail and I am so in love with this polish! Could not be happier with my purchase. Thank you</li>
    <li> This polish is very opaque and the only problem i had is once it dried it was very bumpy almost like a textured polish and needs atleast two coats of topcoat</li>
    <li> This polish has great color, gold with silvery flecks, lasts well without chopping, and gets tons of compliments!  Good packaging from shipper and swift delivery.</li>
    <li> It is a little more gold than i thought, BUT that being said, it lasts forever! I will continue purchasing these liquid sand forever now. My favorite, and i was never a fan of manicure, because they always chipped so fast, but this one helps me keep my nails nice and perfect looking for a long time, perfect for a busy lifestyle.</li>
    <li> Love that Mariah did some colors with them. My daughter and I use this a lot and it&#x27;s so pretty. You do need to put a few top coats over it because it feels rough to the touch like sand.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT. I have placed on nail by its self which gives it a light gold or i place a color undercoat on before pretty both way</li>
    <li> Beautiful coverage in only one coat and very sparkly!!!!! Love the formula and dries pretty fast as well!! Love it!</li>
    <li> I saw this on Pinterest and had to have it for New Year&#x27;s Eve. It&#x27;s not chunky and it has more glitter than other glitter polishes. Needs about 3 coats. Very pretty, not a tacky gold color.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this nail polish! my new favorite! it stays on over a week and comes off fairly easy. I received it very quickly and it was packaged to perfection. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Chose this color for my sister&#x27;s wedding. It&#x27;s sparkly so perfect for a special occasion. Dresses up any outfit. Only con is that it&#x27;s a little more difficult to remove with nail polish remover, but nothing that a little elbow grease couldn&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
    <li> So many sparkles! One of my favorite nail polishes! It is textured which I normally do not like, but this polish looks like a million diamonds on your nails.</li>

    <li> Super cute color!  I get tons of compliments on it!</li>
    <li> This is a great color that goes well with silver or gold.  The application was easy and the polish lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have olive toned skin and this looked like yellow gold on me. It was awful. Just a warning, this is not a warm with olive undertones girl&#x27;s friend. At all.</li>
    <li> This polish is pure glitter fabulousness! I always get compliments when wearing it. It was a great price too! OPI is usually $8.50</li>
