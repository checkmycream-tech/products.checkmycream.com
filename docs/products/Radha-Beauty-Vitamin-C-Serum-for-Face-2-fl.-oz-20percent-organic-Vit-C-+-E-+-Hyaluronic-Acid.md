<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I found the package containing this serum waiting for me to review at the perfect time, right after I&#x27;d come home from an all day beach barbecue. Along with Radha&#x27;s retinol moisturizer, the Vitamin C serum helped my skin recover faster than usual, without drying out and peeling as it normal would. I&#x27;ll be happy to have it going into the summer months.</li>
    <li> This left my skin really smooth and healthy looking without being heavy or sticky. This is really a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> I have only used it about a week so will update at the month point . I have a scar from a odd issue with my kitten , I have used this Vit C serum on my face and arm... The arm has 50 % less redness and the scar is disappearing at point s. This review is my own though obtained product through a coupon</li>
    <li> I received a discount and had a chance to review this serum. Radha Beauty recently changed their packaging of their Vitamin C serum to an amber dropper bottle. While I didn&#x27;t mind the previous packaging, it seemed to go through the serum must quicker. I think the switch works better so that you can see how much serum is left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this organic serum does not contain any parabens, sulfates or alcohol and is additional cruelty-free, you can be assured you&#x27;ll be using a serum that is good for you. As far as effectiveness, the formula which contains 20% vitamin c still works well to resurface the skin gently. While a moisturizer after using this is optional, a sun protectant is not as it goes hand in hand with the serum to prevent further damage to your skin, especially while using a potent ingredient to clear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this after cleansing and drying my skin. The serum absorbs quickly and I can follow-up with a moisturizer. I use this twice a day as I have stubborn skin/scars but I would suggest starting with once a day. I&#x27;ve been using vitamin c serums for a while so my results may or may not be better than expected however I do see my skin texture improving with use. Since this contains ingredients prone to oxidizing, you&#x27;ll need to watch the color of the serum. Once it begins to get a cloudy orange, it&#x27;s around the point where it won&#x27;t be as effective. You will still be able to use the serum but it won&#x27;t work as well and it&#x27;s usually recommended to get a new bottle at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with uneven texture/tone, etc. I would suggest trying out Radha Beauty&#x27;s Vitamin C serum, especially since it&#x27;s an organic product that does not contain unnecessary fillers.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS SERUM.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how I got so lucky to be a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; for Radha products, but they are all great.&lt;br /&gt;I use this one by itself before bed and under their Retinol Moisturizer during the day.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never looked better!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice and light product! It doesn&#x27;t make your face feel oily or heavy after applying. My face has felt considerably softer after using and my fine lines have started to shrink. It&#x27;s also great to know I&#x27;m not rubbing all sorts of random weird chemicals on my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in the appearance of fine lines and dark spots. Though only a small difference I feel like a little bit is better then none at all. I love how smooth my face feels right after applying it. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product is fantastic.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Got my vita c serum today love the fact that the bottle is big from the moment I put it on I see a difference I love the eye cream from them also accept the bottle is too small they need to make it bigger but the products are great will keep ordering from them</li>
    <li> Great Value! Does the job but the liquid consistency takes a bit of getting use to</li>
    <li> Love this product. Smooths skin - evens out skin tone &amp; discolorations. Quick shipping and nice packaging. Let it dry on your face before applying other products. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Recent purchase, time will tell. So far I am very pleased at the feel &amp; results of the vitamin C serum from Radha products.</li>
    <li> Awesome product would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> I Love this product!!!! My face is looking good feels tighter.</li>
    <li> I Should have never changed brands. I thought I would get lucky with this buy at 2oz versus my usually 1oz at same price and boy am I disappointed. It&#x27;s very important for me in a serum to have that tightness feeling after I apply. This product WILL NOT give you that feeling which basically its worthless watered down product which is why you can buy 2ozs for the 1oz price of the good stuff. This product is junk</li>
    <li> Good quality serum. Smells nice, very faint scent. A little bit goes a long way. I just started using it. Already, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin has more moisture and is brighter. As for fine wrinkles, I don&#x27;t have many, yet. My skin is pretty firm and my complexion is very even, as I&#x27;m only 38 and have always used proper sunscreen and have always moisturized and switched to organic skincare years ago.</li>
    <li> I have used this produce for two months. I had a few sun spots on my cheek bones it really help to lighten them. I have also had my teenage son use it and it has helped with his acne and to improve the texture of his skin. The serum was light non greasy and did not leave my skin feeling tight. My face felt very soft and supple after using the produce. I am very picky about the skin products that I use on myself and my family. But I really love the Radha Products. They use high quality ingredient that are safe for you.</li>
    <li> This product absorbs quickly into the skin. It has helped to soften my skin and reduce some wrinkles on my face, especially around my eyes and forehead. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s. Make sure you use sunscreen with this product if you are using it during the day. I use it under my night and day cream.</li>
    <li> I used it twice, I can really see and feel the difference.... it appears to be very effective.... having a  very sensitive skin, I cannot use everything... THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> It gives a refreshing feeling and makes your skin feel tighter after application. I usually add moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I give This vitamin c Serum as a gift for my friend she loves it so much and happy using this :)</li>
    <li> This product is awful, it seems like a raw juice from fruits or plants at the first day and became rotten smell the next couple days. Won&#x27;t buy it again. No thanks!</li>
    <li> No noticeable difference, I doubt this stuff even worked at all.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely fantastic! I started receiving compliment from my friends at work few days after I began using it. I&#x27;ll highly recommend it to anyone wishing for a fresh radiant look.</li>
    <li> This is my first experience with Vitamin C serum. I have read a lot about the benefits for the skin, so I am looking forward to using longer and seeing the results. I would have given the product five stars, but results for this type of product are not instant (no matter what brand you buy); I do love that this product is high-quality, rich and easily absorbed, and comes with a satisfaction guarantee. I choose Radha for their quality, effectiveness, organic and cruelty-free traits, and guarantee.</li>
    <li> Product works well, nice consistency, and smells good. The product however is shipped 1 bottle at a time which is completely wasteful. I&#x27;m not a green advocate but the way this company handles their orders is ridiculous.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I was ordering vitamin E and kept getting the suggestion to order vitamin C so I ordered this. I&#x27;m absolutely obsessed with it. I use it every single day. I&#x27;m not the type of person he remembers to use a new product every single day, but this product is amazing and makes my skin look radiant. I am 25 and have normal to oily skin.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever used vitamin C on my face and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed with Radha! There&#x27;s no awful smell, goes on easily and leave your face feeling revitalized. I wanted to wait until I had been using this for a few weeks before doing my review. I have noticed improvements. I applied the serum in the morning &amp; evening. My skin feels/looks extremely healthier and softer. I have noticed the dark circles around my eyes have faded, which is the biggest problem I have been struggling. Give it about 3-4 weeks of daily use to see improvements. Also, I used Radha retinol gel each time I applied the serum and I believe they compliment each other very well. I definitely highly recommend Radha!</li>
    <li> I think this product is great, I was ultimately looking for something to lighten my face because as a black woman in the middle of July I was tired of coming home with my face being a lot darker than my body. This product didn&#x27;t lighten my face (staying out of the sun has) but it has definitely helped brighten my face and get rid of any dark marks on my face. The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest but it fades away quickly, the formula is very light, almost like water which I really like.</li>
    <li> I started using this product and then stopped as I had just given birth and my skin was a bit sensitive but will definitely start using it again now as my hormones have settled down.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that a little goes a long way but dont forget to do a patch test first before using.&lt;br /&gt;I love Radha products and i&#x27;m sure this one will be as good as the other products of theirs that I use</li>
    <li> Just received the oil. Love the glass bottle! Dried it on and it feels very nice on the skin!</li>
    <li> Got this today and tried it out it has a slight smell to it but as soon as it dries the smell goes away it seems like..... i hope for the results its promised....... will update after i use it for a while</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this product and i have to say i absolutely love it! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love the product however the rubber stopper didn&#x27;t fit and wouldn&#x27;t stay screwed on tight so I had to use one from another bottle sadly.  The product itself is excellent in all ways.</li>
    <li> This is a great vitamin C serum with an equally great price.  I have sensitive skin and this serum does not irritate my face.  It makes my skin brighter and I have noticed a decrease in the discoloration I have began to experience as I am aging.  I also like this companies return policy.  If you try this and don&#x27;t like it, then you can simply return it for a refund.  I think vitamin C gives my skin that &amp;#34;pregnant woman glow&amp;#34; without being pregnant.  I&#x27;m also against animal testing and this is a no cruelty company!</li>
    <li> This is a good vitamin c serum. I have been using it for a while to help with sun spots on my face. It has helped to lighten the spots and the new dropper bottle packaging is much handier to use. I was given this product for my fair and honest opinion. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> My face is pretty oily, so I have a hard time finding products for my face. but I absolutely loved this product. will for sure buy again!</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price. Vitamin c serum can usually be pricey, but this one is reasonable. Thank you!</li>
    <li> great product. My skin is glowing in the mornings after using it at bedtime</li>
    <li> i love vitamin c serum and how soft it makes your skin, fantastic product, purchased for a reduced  rate for a helpful review</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll wait for at least 3-6 months before I review the product for efficacy (and I&#x27;ll update this review) but one thing I can say right away is that it smells horrible. The product has a burnt rubber odor and it tends to stay with you, so unless you want to smell like a tire shop the whole day, I would stay away.</li>
    <li> I have used quite a few products from Radha Beauty in the past and I have never been disappointed by any of them. One of my favorite products is this Vitamin C Serum. I never leave the house and I never go to bed without applying this serum on my face because it really makes my skin look  different - younger and glowing. It does a great job in &amp;#34;plumping&amp;#34; the texture of my skin and in effect, the fine lines that used to annoy the bejezzuz out of me have become less and less noticeable. I love this serum - it&#x27;s one of my beauty staples!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Just received the Vitamin C Serum last week.  I&#x27;ve already noticed some positive results but need more time to see that they are not temporary.</li>
    <li> I have the oily combination skin, and the vitamin c serum works very well for me. The texture is light and did not leave my face oily or tight, and my face felt good after applying it. In addition, the size (2oz) of the vitamin C serum doubled the size than most serums I used before, but the quality is as good as well.</li>
    <li> It has lessened my crows feet and frown lines...sweet...</li>
    <li> Can really see a difference with my skin tone and pores, comparable to other brands but a bit cheaper at the check out.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a achieving smoother and more even skin. I love how it absorbs instantly and leaves my skin so soft. I use Radha Rosehip oil after and I already see a difference in my skin after 2 weeks. I can&#x27;t wait to see the progress after a month. I am 37 and have sunspots and sensitive combination skin. I have not had any irritation or breakouts from Radha products. I&#x27;m so happy to have found this company who, by the way, does not test on animals!</li>
    <li> Great packaging and arrived a day earlier than expected. Light watery consistency, which easily absorbed into my skin. Did not sting my skin like other vc&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days but can already see my skin is more even and soft.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a difference yet but I have only been using it for two weeks now</li>
    <li> Absolutely wonderful from the first application, had co worker ask me what was I doing to my skin, looks terrific, are you doing something different?&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have been using Radha Vitamin C serum for 5 months now including their moisturizer and gel for eye&#x27;s.  I am no where near impressed by this vitamin c serum. How long should it actually take to get rid of two age spots that sent even large. Completely dissapointed and angry that I&#x27;ve wasted so much money with these products with little results!!  I&#x27;m sorry for the negativity but I&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is a great product for your skin. I love that it is cruelty free and organic. It really does live up to its claim of revitalizing and bringing your skin back to a youthful state. My skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> A unique serum. It is extremely watery, in fact it isn&#x27;t a gel like consistancy at all. I apply it to the back of my hand in small amounts so I can easily apply to my face without losing any on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was skeptical when I realized it was so watery. However, I have liked the brands other products so far and pressed onward with applying it to my face. Once the product is on the skin, you can see and feel the hydrating serum soak in. A small amount is needed and covers well- even as liquidy as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may be tempted to apply to the face with a cotton ball or pad. I would not do this as it will use more of the precious product than really intended or needed. Some may try to apply the dropped directly to the face and squeeze the dropper. That could actually cause the product to end up someplace it wasn&#x27;t intended- ie, mouth,nose or eyes or simply having the product roll down your face -wasting the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By applying a small amount to the back side of the hand helps me apply the serum easily to targeted areas of my face. My only &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; on this product is the scent. It is a natural scent( meaning the company did not formulate it with a bunch of scent to mask it. I find the scent somewhat medicinal or herbal?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fades once product is absorbed/dry. I enjoyed everything else about this product and that includes the fact that it is hydrating and brightening.</li>
    <li> this feels like a water with some ascorbic acids in it.&lt;br /&gt; Had no improvement over 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt; Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of vitamin C serums, supplements and such. Vitamin C is very crucial to the resilience of our skin. Many of us take an oral supplement and don&#x27;t realize that we also need to be using products that work from the outside in... I love radha beauty products, I have also used the Rose Hip Oil..... I&#x27;m a big fan!  This serum, has another great benefit for our skin, added....vitamin E.. This serum does give your skin a little moisture as well. It is idea for people who struggle with extra dryness. It goes on thin and will eventually start to fade your dark spots!!! Please feel confident in using this specific serum. I suffer from melisma, and every day I use this, my spots look a little better. I did receive this item, discounted, for testing.</li>
    <li> I have been hesitant to review this because my review isn&#x27;t good but I felt it necessary since I depend on reviews good or bad I figured I should go for it to give a different opinion of this. Not sure if I got a bad batch but this was very thin &amp; dried sticky/tacky on my face not like a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; at all I also hated the smell!</li>
    <li> I love my purchase. It arrived before it was expected nicely packed. I tried it and it is great! I highly recommend it to all ladies out there !I It leaves your skin fresh and healthy. Thank you! Great seller!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product however the packaging has changed from a sealed pump container to the brown glass bottle . Vitamin C deteriorates very quickly when exposed to air and light, it turns from clear to yellow. This bottle does not provide enough protection and I can see the serum changing color rather quickly even though I keep it sealed tightly in a drawer. Won&#x27;t buy it again in this packaging.</li>
    <li> I do not really see a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Okay first of all, I&#x27;m 16 and using this product. It never hurts to start preventing wrinkles. Even though I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, this serum works like magic. My skin has cleared up and is more toned. It is also super smooth, soft, and my eczema has calmed down TREMENDOUSLY. I highly recommend for any age :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and it may be too soon to see its full potential.  I have been using it with Radha&#x27;s Retinol Moisturizer and my skin is smoother and more luminous.  I have not noticed a reduction in brown spots but am hoping they will fade with continued use.  I would definitely reconmend this product</li>
    <li> this is the best !! everyone is saying how good my skin looks and years younger</li>
    <li> This serum is light and absorbs right into my skin and makes it feel lightly moisturized.  I love that this product is cruelty free, organic and does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates.  I have combination skin and it works great when my skin feels oily or dry.  Radha Beauty is a brand I trust and like the products I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sample provided.</li>
    <li> Not seeing drastic results yet, but I like what is doing to my skin so far. It gives my skin nice clean look.</li>
    <li> the smell slis strong but lets my skin like renewed</li>
    <li> no difference in skin tone or look after 1 month of using.</li>
    <li> I find this product refreshing. It is light-weight and gentle.</li>
    <li> It doesn’t have the feel of serum. It is watery and doesn’t reduce my sun spots like my other one did.</li>
    <li> Great product. Can notice some results so far.</li>
    <li> Noticed improvement right away.</li>
    <li> Product arrived fast. Love  this for my face!</li>
    <li> Very good quality serum. This is now a part of my daily routine</li>
    <li> I GOT THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  I USE THIS EVERY MORNING AND EVERY NIGHT.  IT GOES ON AND ABSORBS QUICKLY.  I FEEL LIKE MY FINE LINES AND WRINKLES ARE FADING.  I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE WHO IS WORRIED ABOUT LOOKING OLDER.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift and they said it feels great after taking a shower!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C oil is so great for the under part of your eyes. I am always self conscious of that area of my face and vitamin C oil is the best thing for it. When I put on creams under my eyes sometimes I feel like they aren&#x27;t really getting to the root of the problem. With this Serum it really helps with the lines and the puffiness under my eyes. It&#x27;s super light and quick absorbing. I would highly recommend Vitamin C serum if you haven&#x27;t tried it yet. My was given this product for free as a sample to try. All opinions are based on my usage of the product and are my own thoughts about it.</li>
    <li> I received this for free to review, but all opinions are my own.  I really have enjoyed this product.  It feels really nice on my skin.  I noticed that my skin just glows when I wake up.  I will be a faithful user of this product!</li>
    <li> product for review: I love this product. Vitamin C is great for your skin and this company delivers just that.</li>
    <li> Very nice texture,  not what I consider a serum more watery then any serum I have experienced. Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell at all.  Kinda disappointed because when I think of vitamin c I think of oranges, but that&#x27;s not a deal breaker.  It has lighten the sun spot that I have on my nose and made my skin soft that&#x27;s all that really matters.  I received this at a promotional cost to try and I am so glad that I did.  I have wanted to try the vitamin c serum for a while but didn&#x27;t want to waste my hard earned money on something I didn&#x27;t know if it would work or not.  Now that I do know that it works I would happily spend my hard earned money and recommend to my friends and family.  Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel tight and refreshed!!!! Love the way it makes my face great!!! I received a promo code for discount!!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  It really brightens the skin, and gives the face a youthful glow.  I look well rested despite the lack of sleep.  Use once a day under makeup or moisturizer.  Works really well!!</li>
    <li> I use this every night before i go to bed, i saw instant results in less then 2 weeks, my skin is brighter, smoother and plump. This helped alot with evening my skin tone. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tryed it yet, but it seems pretty nice. Got here two days early. It only gets four stars though, because it stinks 😂😂</li>
    <li> All these reviews from folks that received samples or whatever really fooled me. After months of using this still can&#x27;t see any difference. I&#x27;m sure it works for some, but it didn&#x27;t work for me :-(</li>
    <li> Radha Vitamin C Serum is a clear liquid serum that went on smoothly. After using for a couple of days, I can already tell a difference in the appearance of my skin. It just has a bit of healthier look to it. The skin feels softer and is starting to look smoother. I feel like it is bringing out the unhealthy toxins and healing my skin. Im enjoying using it and would like to purchase more after this bottle is gone. I recieved this free sample for trying and sharing my honest unbiased opinion of it.</li>
    <li> After having bought several of the Radha Beauty products I received this bottle as a gift from the company! Goes on silky smooth, leaving no oily film or residue. I&#x27;ve been using Radha&#x27;s Vitamin C serum for several months now, and I feel my skins looks and feels better with each passing day. I highly recommend adding this product as well as the entire Radha Beauty line to your daily skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> When I first received the Vitamin C Serum I was very concerned with the look of the formula. It looked very runny, but I can say after using it for 5 days straight I am a big fan! I&#x27;ve never used any similar kind of product but happy I tried this one.I have noticed that my natural skin moisture is better than ever! My skin tone even seems to look more alive &amp; healthy. I have even tried using it before spending time out in the sun &amp; seemed to do a wonderful job at protecting my face! I definitely recommend everyone to try this product &amp; I plan to continue my use of it because I am very happy with the results!!</li>
    <li> I am so far liking the Vitamin C Serum from radha beauty products . This comes in a 2 FL Oz bottle , Its made in the USA and it is not tested on animals .  I have been using this for a few days now and can already tell a difference. My skin feels better and looks better and not only does this seem to be working it also smells good so you don&#x27;t have to worry about putting something that smells horrid on your face .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this at a reduced rate for my fair and unbiased opinion .</li>
    <li> Oil separated, float on the surface.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well. No overnight results, so keep your expectations reasonable. As part of an overall facial regime, I am gradually seeing an improvement in my skin. After about 3 weeks, my skin is noticeably clearer and smoother.</li>
    <li> Overall I like this product. I feel it working as soon as I apply it, with tighter skin right away, but it&#x27;s fully absorbed and I hardly know it&#x27;s there within 15-20 minutes. My only complaint is that I don&#x27;t think the fragrance is very pleasant, but that might just be because I&#x27;m not used to fragrance-free skincare products or because I use so many skin care products that are scented with essential oils that have a stronger aroma. I definitely think my skin is smoother after using the Vitamin C Serum for just a few days.</li>
    <li> I really love this serum! I have been using this for awhile now and I can tell a drastic difference in my skin. My complexion has greatly improved and my face is much clearer since using this product!</li>
    <li> Radha products live up to their descriptions. I love this serum!</li>
    <li> Radha is fast becoming one of my favorite brands of skincare products. I have been using different products of theirs for a while now and each has given great results. This vita c serum is no different. The price is unbelievable for the quantity that you get but that wouldn&#x27;t matter without results. My face has a very beautiful glow that has come on since using this and its really helping with the firmness of my skin. The bags under my eyes have had great results and bonus, it is helping clear up my occasional pms blemishes faster and even lightening a discoloration I&#x27;ve had on my upper lip from a botched waxing job I did a few years ago! It is very thin and absorbs quickly without any residue or stickiness and drop or 2 of this serum really goes a long way. At this 2oz size it&#x27;s double my other vitamin c serums I&#x27;ve bought in the past and will last me months I&#x27;m sure. I love this serum and highly recommend it. Fantastic quality at an affordable price. I did receive this first bottle free as part of a promotion for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and opinion after trying it out.</li>
    <li> new bottle is easier to see level of product and easier to control how much you dispense. the product itself is a true miracle - I use it all over my face, neck, and décolletage and my skin thanks me for it everyday!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in on my face for the last month, and I can tell you that I can see the difference it has made. I&#x27;m 28 and I&#x27;ve had minor &#x27;stress wrinkles&#x27; on my forehead that I couldn&#x27;t not figure how to treat. This product has helped a lot to smooth out my skin so far, and it does not feel greasy at all. I will definitely be purchasing more when I run out, and recommend it for something with a rejuvenating effect on your skin.</li>
    <li> Wonderfull! Try it its good</li>
    <li> Dries out my skin after applying, have not seen a difference or improvent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Everything Radha beauty makes I always have to try. Really good quality and you will see results after a few weeks!</li>
    <li> But, I wish to be more concentrated  and the serum. My face looks better after started using this product .&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical because of the price, but honestly I&#x27;ve used this for a week and swear I already notice smoother skin and it seems brighter also.  I will be ordering this again when the large bottle is out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a week.  I noticed my face is really red and splotchy after I put this on..especially in the morning.  Its too early to tell if its doing me any good yet...</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle of serum from Radha. The first one was given to me by a friend as a gift and with this one I was able to get it in a discounted price..Yay!!! This product is love. I feel my skin being tight and fine lines are unnoticeable anymore. This is very lightweight when used.</li>
    <li> Best serum ever!!!!  You only need a small amount to cover your face and neck.  There is no greasy residue and it blends nicely.  The smell is good, too.  I love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried other Vitamin C Serum and they are good but I really like this one better. It doesn&#x27;t have a great smell but it makes my face so much smoother than the other one. It helps with my oily skin as well and I also follow up with a light moisturizer for that added protection for the sun. This is also a much bigger bottle than the other brand I have tried before. I was giving this brand for a deep discount for my unbiased honest opinion. I feel like my face is getting younger every time I used this product. I am 44 years old and it&#x27;s time to stop the aging processes as much as I can. :-)</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s, I decided to buy this.  I read that Vitamin C serum is amazing for your skin.  I haven&#x27;t noticed drastic results, but I will update soon.  Great price &amp; large bottle.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed this. It brought a new liveliness to my skin. I would definitely buy this again, please keep making it!</li>
    <li> This oil made my skin smooth, yet not greasy. I found putting it on at bedtime then washing my face in the morning worked best for me. I didn&#x27;t ned any added lotions.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this with my entire heart. It goes on so nicely and makes my face feel wonderful! Unfortunately, it&#x27;s caused some seriously bad breakouts and I can&#x27;t continue to use it. So sad! If your skin isn&#x27;t sensitive and acne-prone, this will probably be for you. If you have skin like mine, stay away. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE::&lt;br /&gt;Radha Beauty is A GREAT company! They&#x27;re seriously serious about their refund if you don&#x27;t love it! They handled it quickly and beautifully. While the product wasn&#x27;t for me, I don&#x27;t want people to be discouraged. This is a wonderful company and if this product doesn&#x27;t work for you or doesn&#x27;t appeal, try some of their other stuff! I know I will in the future :)</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to really make a thorough decision on its efficacy, but I can say this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made with high-quality, natural ingredients. It&#x27;s not filled with cheap fillers or artificial fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It SMELLS LIKE CINNAMON. If you&#x27;ve ever used Vitamin C oils you&#x27;ll know that some of them smell questionable. This one smells delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light and the witch hazel has a wonderful toning effect. It&#x27;s great to use even on hot days because your skin will feel cool and refreshed, despite it being a serum (which are often heavy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to moisturize well and it doesn&#x27;t affect my EXTREMELY sensitive skin, so I would encourage anyone with sensitive skin to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update this review in a few months after I see how it functions long-term.</li>
    <li> This product is good! One of my friends recommended it and I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now every morning and evening. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin feels more smoother and wrinkles are getting lesser. I like that this product is vegan and it&#x27;s not oily. It also has nice fragrance to it. The only thing I wish that the bottle uses pump instead of the dropper besides that the product is good and very affordable.</li>
    <li> Bottle was broken on arrival and had leaked into packaging everywhere.</li>
    <li> love this vitamin c, makes my skin look brighter</li>
    <li> Good size product and fast customer service. I&#x27;m very happy with the Vitamin C Serum</li>
    <li> ...its been a few weeks now since using.....i had very dark pigmentation on my cheekbones...chin...t-zone.....this product is helping evenly fading it out....and i&#x27;ve tried everything including Obaji..which i was not impressed with....i still have a long way to go but so far i am very happy with how much more brighter my skin looks and how much lighter my pigmentation is getting...(i only use at night after washing my face)...i will continue to use</li>
    <li> So far, so good. Feels great and I haven&#x27;t broken out which is saying something cause my skin is super sensitive.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I really wish I&#x27;d taken before and after pictures, because this stuff did something no other product has been able to do for me: faded my acne scars.  I&#x27;ve had these scars for about 6 years now and basically gave up hope on ever getting rid of them.  I was saving up for laser treatments because nothing else worked.  After applying the serum for just 2 nights I noticed a HUGE difference.  My skin tone (finally) appears to match the rest of my face and the texture is much, much smoother.  It&#x27;s only been a week and a half but this is definitely becoming a staple in my skin care routine. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for the past week and I already feel the difference on my skin. This is a great product and i recommend it to everyone. Definitely buying it again!</li>
    <li> Love it. It feels nice and smooth...not greasy, especially under makeup. I makes my skin feel silky. The only downside is the consistency. I wish it was a little bit thicker.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! I&#x27;ve only had it 2 days and have been using it on my face and my face looks and feels better. 2 DAYS!!! It goes on easily and is not heavy or oily on the face. Will be using this for life (&#x3D; received a discount for my review.</li>
    <li> Fresh, clean and feels nice on skin...</li>
    <li> I got this product free to test And I can honestly say I really like it I was worried it would make my face oily which I hate but it def does not it soaks in and makes my face feel great would def buy it again</li>
    <li> I work outside year round and I was using another product that Amazon sells but I switched and this is much better on my skin. I am a guy who wants to take care of my body I have for the long haul. Try this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve</li>
    <li> Only been using for a week. So far so good. No negative comments.</li>
    <li> I am 32, have sensitive, acne prone combination skin with enlarged pores and acne scars. I was very skeptical when I read so many of the reviews and saw that they had received it for free or at discount, but since it was in my price range I decided to give it a chance - It really is good! I have been using vitamin C skin products to try to improve my skin issues and wasn&#x27;t seeing results from drugstore products. They would irritate or sting or break me out and I would have to throw it and the money I spent away. So disappointing and frustrating! I used this one for a month and I love it! I am super generous with application day and night, so I am going through it probably faster than most would, but definitely a good buy as I have quite a bit left. I appreciate that it comes in a glass amber bottle (would love a pump version btw). Quality ingredients, absorbs super fast, no irritation, no residue. I am currently trying out another brand, but will come back for this one again!</li>
    <li> I’m loving all of Radha Beauty’s products! I know it’s said that wrinkles only show how much you’ve laughed but I’d rather them not show and people just have to get to know my bubbly personality without that visual aid! If you haven’t heard the buzz about Vitamin C serum by now you should probably totally check out Radha’s serum, it’s pretty much a little fountain of youth packed into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This power packed serum aka your defense against wrinkles has Vitamin C, E, AMINO, Hyaluronic Acid. Someone gave up the secret recipe to the fountain of youth right there! Why you ask? This serum stimulates collagen and reduces fine lines and wrinkles, great organic ingredients and science give you the power to reduce those wrinkles and or even stop them from occurring! Vitamin C also has antioxidants and is anti-inflammatory also promotes the production of elastin. This stuff not only gives you a younger look, kicks wrinkles butts but it makes you have a somewhat glow about you, it’s a healthy glow because your skin is happier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been experimenting with this on some stretch marks also (it is intended for your face) but I thought what the heck why not see if it can help my mommy stripes across my belly. What??? Yea it’s actually been helping with those too… just throwing that out there for any moms who not only want a younger vibrant looking face but help with those awesome tiger stripe marks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a non greasy fast absorbing serum, it doesn’t smell like anything really and putting it on is fast and easy. It took a couple of seconds and it was absorbed and dried easily. I applied a moisturizer after wards to ward off any drying of my skin but I do not have anything negative to report. I feel like my face is happy, that sounds odd, but you’d have to try it out to really get why I say that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve noticed fine lines have disappeared and the area around my mouth (laugh line area) and beside my eyes (crows feet area) has a nice tight feeling to it. I have yet to get any wrinkles but with regular usage of this I’m hoping to delay that as long as possible. Gotta give it to Radha Beauty this is yet again another amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**crows feet area) has a nice tight feeling to it. I have yet to get any wrinkles but with regular usage of this I’m hoping to delay that as long as possible.

    <li> love it , its a very light serum . i see a huge difference on my skin since i use it....will buy again</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I haven&#x27;t had this very long but what I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin is smoother and softer. I was impressed enough to purchase Radha&#x27;s retinol facial cream and am still pleased. The serum was neatly packaged and the bottle did not leak.  I will buy more Radha products in the future.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vitamin C Serum twice a day for just a week, and I can&#x27;t believe the results already!  I&#x27;m 75 years old and tried this as a last resort after reading several articles extolling the benefits of Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid on your skin.  In a perfect world, I&#x27;d have unlimited funds and a wonderful plastic surgeon so I could have a facelift.  Well, this is a fabulous next-best-thing and I&#x27;m delighted!!</li>
    <li> This product is two watery and I&#x27;ve not seen any changes in my skin.</li>
    <li> I received the product fast. I have very sensitive skin and when I first put the product on it burns my face a little but after about 5 minutes it goes away. I noticed the fine lines around my eyes starting to go away. When the product dries my face is really soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Using now seems ok, Thanks</li>
    <li> This product has helped my dry feet.  I know it says to use on facial areas, but I wanted to see what it would do for my feet.  After removing the dead skin, I applied this with some tea tree oil and they are smooth and very soft to the touch.  The skin is very clear and clean as the bottom of a person&#x27;s feet should be... aka like a baby&#x27;s feet.  I love the way that my feet feel and how healthy that this has made them look!  I have to highly recommend this to other&#x27;s with feet issues as well as their faces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for free to do a review.  All thoughts are my own and no other&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It work on my skin,  good a little better!!</li>
    <li> So far it seems to be working as expected</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for awhile and its wonderful. The dropper is easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover my whole face and neck My skin is feeling really soft.  I love how this makes my skin feel.</li>
    <li> Part of my daily routine!&lt;br /&gt;First I lather up with my Radha Vitamin C face wash. I only need a pee size amount. A little goes a long way. My face is so clean. Then I follow up with my Radha Vitamin C serum. I love this. The thin consistency is soaked up quickly as if my face is so thirsty. Then last I use my Radha Moisturizer. Nice product leaves my face so smooth, glowing and non greasy. If you aren&#x27;t smiling Radha will refund your money. I&#x27;m smiling, loving my Radha Beauty products.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face smooth, fresh and bright. I feel incomplete when not using this product during my daily facial regimen. It even has helped with my breakouts.</li>
    <li> Actually I never wright a review. I ordered the serum more then a month ago, but open it later. Wanted to finished OZ Naturals - THE BEST Hyaluronic Acid Serum For Skin, that I liked very much. I used this one few times only and surprised. The surface cover by foame. It irritates my skin. Unpleasant sensation. Very disappointed. Wish to return, but miss due time.</li>
    <li> I love how it&#x27;s not greasy and I can already see and feel a difference</li>
    <li> Great product Love it</li>
    <li> The first week of using this product was very satisfying to me. It brightened up my skin and faded the dark spots. And I like the natural smell. Then I started to get break outs. I don&#x27;t get break outs often. If I stopped using this serum, the break out would go down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have previously used Vitamin C serum from two other brands.  One was better than the other. Neither broke me out. I was drawn to this one after  I tried the awesome lavender oil from this company. Going forward, I will use this serum on my hands, just not on my face. This serum does a fine job helping my hands to heal after a long day.</li>
    <li> Good serum , it makes my face glossy and my dark spots are getting better</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this great product.  I had two stubborn acne bumps and this wonderful Vitamin C serum has made them vanish.  Totally satisfied.  A+</li>
    <li> Love this  Radha vitamin C serum, it&#x27;s so light and works so well, I have noticed some of the discoloration in my skin getting back to normal, I use it after I clean my face at night, but I should use it in the morning too, which I would begin doing ASAP.  Love all of Radha&#x27;s products, but the most important aspect of this products is that they are all natural and not tested on animals, which makes these products my preferred brand, I would use all of their products due to the quality and positive results in my skin, just wonderful products!!!!</li>
    <li> Three days and I see improvement!  Sun spots are fading on face.&lt;br /&gt;Trying on hands next.</li>
    <li> appears to be tightening and providing some desired results///I like a company that responded to my  complaint re a broken dropper and replaced it quite quickly.  I like that you replaced the old dropper with one that actually fits in the bottle rather than the one that was separate.</li>
    <li> my skin seems healthier</li>
    <li> Creates a tightening feeling at first, but I saw no dramatic or long-term results. Bottle is almost gone, too. Bummer</li>
    <li> This vitamin C serum is amazing! My skin is dry, uneven! This serum made my skin brighter, radiant! In a week you will start finding the diffrence! Its very light, observe quicky makes skin soft and supple :) This vitamin C serum quality is really too good!! I would reccomand this serum to all!!  ***i got this serum for free to review but the opinion is completlt my own, nothing to do with the promotion**</li>
    <li> I have purchased a similar serum before, I was allowed to try this product and given a discount.  I must say being a beauty fanatic this serum is great before bed under a moisturizer because of its quick absorption and non-greasy texture.  In my past experience, I find vitamin C serums to be too thick or too runny.  As a note, vitamin C serums are best for evening use as the sun likes to absorb Vitamin C.  I would purchase this item again at full price!  Great product.  Day 2 I woke up to refreshed skin that was visibly more even.</li>
    <li> I love this product it can be used in so many way s and for so many things! It is by far one of the greatest products that I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Amazing product! Plan to order again!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for almost a month. I expected to be allergic to it since that is my track record, thankfully I&#x27;m not!&lt;br /&gt; I can already see a difference around my eyes, upper lip and neck!&lt;br /&gt;I decided the second night to put half of it on the BACK of my hand, put it on half of my face and do the same thing on the BACK of my other hand.&lt;br /&gt;As we know, women can get rid of facial fine lines but our hands &amp;#34;give us away&amp;#34;!!&lt;br /&gt;The proof of this serum is starting to show on my face already. But my hands look 15 years younger!</li>
    <li> One thing I liked didn&#x27;t  irritate my eyes large bottle, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, Iam still looking for my favorite one but I haven&#x27;t found it. You still need to put a  moisturizer on after this serum I didn&#x27;t know so I used an Aveda product to put on top of it, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good  combination</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff.... I have always had issues with scaring from acne.. This stuff really helps with clearing your skin! HIGHLY recommended!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product, I was upset because I bought 3 bottles but they shipped each one separately from the other which cost a lot of money to me !</li>
    <li> I have purchased several Radha products and so far I am happy with all of them. I am really enjoying this vitamin c serum it leaves my face so soft and smooth. I have rocasea and very sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin at all. The bottle is 2 oz and a little goes a long way, it should last you a long time. Vitamin c serum is proven to stimulate collagen and reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles. I really like that this product does not contain any alcohol, parabens, or sulfates.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34; below. Thank you. :)&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED REVIEW.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great antioxidants. Highly recommend! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> First off, I did not receive a discount or receive this product for free. I also was a little skeptical and wondered if some of these positive reviews I read were real or fake? I&#x27;m guessing they are actually real because I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve found this to be a good product. Just so you also know, I am a huge product junkie. I am constantly buying/trying new face products all the time, expecting miracles in the end. Unfortunately, I never seem to be fully satisfied. For me to rate this 4 stars means I&#x27;m pretty happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this 3 months ago after using Radha&#x27;s Skin Clearing Serum (this is actually a good product as well) for a month. With this order, I also bought the Radha Retinol Moisturizer to use with it. I am in my 30&#x27;s and have some very small fine lines forming on my forehead and get occasional mild breakouts. What I found works best for me is using this product on alternating nights. I use the Radha Skin Clearing Serum one night and then the Radha Vitamin C Serum/Radha Retinol Moisturizer the next. After 3 months, I can honestly say I am quite pleased. The small fines lines on my forehead definitely have a softer appearance. Some days, they are completely gone. For an &amp;#34;over the counter product&amp;#34;, all 3 of these are quite good. If you are expecting it to work a miracle overnight, then you&#x27;re going to be disappointed. However, if you use these products consistently for a few months, then I think you will be pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is the bottle it comes in. It gets exposed to air every time you use it. I read in the Q&amp;A section that they only recommend using it for 3 months after opening. The Skin Clearing Serum and Retinol Moisturizer come in a much better designed system that is airtight. I wish they would also put this in that same type of container. I only use this every other night so I still have half of the bottle left. Since this serum is inexpensive, I don&#x27;t mind repurchasing this every 3 months. I can&#x27;t believe I just said REPURCHASE. I usually never try the same skin care product TWICE ;-)every 3 months. I can&#x27;t believe I just said REPURCHASE. I usually never try the same skin care product TWICE ;-)</li>
    <li> But the bottles a good size&lt;br /&gt;Attractive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as thick compared to other liquids&lt;br /&gt;I did sample it once since the product arrived&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5 star review actually goes out to the company and their staff for quick replies about the product I received because I was afraid the heat from the UPS truck would affect it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(It didn&#x27;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the staff showed a good deal of concern with my personal experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this product so far seems top quality compared to the same type of product from more expensive companies&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, quality and quantity you really can&#x27;t beat this</li>
    <li> I have ordered for this serum, cause i have read positive things about it. the first thing that goes to my mind is, will it cause me allergies? or will i have problems after i use it. I have a very sensitive skin, that if i use a product that my skin didn&#x27;t like i will have allergies for days. but with the Vitamin C Serum, i have not encountered any of that. i applied it first to my hands, it dries up fast and it feels tightening my skin. Knowing that i don&#x27;t have allergies, i applied it to my face and neck everyday. Rough edges of my skin were gone. i am surprised how this bottle lightens and soften my face. i will recommend it with my friends and family. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it, you will never regret it! I have received this awesome product for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased opinion. :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now and am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I have ordered Vitamin C Serum before and it was thick serum.  This product is very watery and not what I expected it to be.  I will be returning product back.</li>
    <li> I loved so soft this made my face. I really noticed a difference when I put on my makeup it just went on so much more smoother Great product.</li>
    <li> Still waiting to see some results, so far not impressed</li>
    <li> What I like about the Radha  beauty skincare vitamin C serum is that the ingredients includes antioxidant which is the ferulic acid plus the jojoba oil. Ferulic acid is a potent antioxidant and its powerful if you combine it with vitamin E and vitamin C which this serum both have. The jojoba oil helps with the acne. If you are prone to having acne or pimple like me this is good for you. Since some of the serums causes acne if you have a very sensitive skin, this one somehow prevents it. I do like the consistency of it is very thin. It means it doesn&#x27;t have extenders so your skin will easily absorb it. It is best to use it with moisturizer though because that will stabilize the serum better. I like about this is it tightens my pores too aside from removing the acne marks. I am 28 so I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles but I can see that the texture of my skin is so much better. Make sure to wear sunscreen during the day though. It helps in achieving faster result regarding pimple marks. I was lucky enough to be able to have it to try for free in exchange of my objective and equitable review.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a skeptic, so I started slowly.  First, I noticed a change in the texture of my skin.  Then I noticed the face and neck getting firmer -- and now, I am thrilled.  This isn&#x27;t a face lift, but it&#x27;s a whole lot safer and does a heck of a lot for the money.  I just ordered more;)&lt;br /&gt;*********************************************************&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just tried the &#x27;new and improved formula&#x27; (I think the grapefruit + may have been added).  The beautiful skin texture is not there, as well as the tight pores.  My face is blotchy and a bit red.&lt;br /&gt;I always ask WHY people change a product when  WAS great, so I pose this question to you.  WHY change a good product, and if you have any of the old formula, may I please get some more of that formula?</li>
    <li> Compared to other vitamin c serums this brand seems to be very diluted. Oz naturals is the best!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for 2 weeks under moisturiser and make up and already feel a difference. Skin is firmer and bouncier!</li>
    <li> I use this every morning and evening after cleaning my face.  It absorbs well and so far seems to have positive effects on my skin - smoother.  Several months usage will give me a more accurate rating.  It does not sting nor have any negative side effects.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample to use and give my opinion.  I like how it makes my skin feel soft</li>
    <li> Really like the dropper bottle. Less mess, which means I waste less.&lt;br /&gt;Serum dries fast, no residue, and very light feeling on the face. A little goes a long ways!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t even feel sticky like some others I&#x27;ve used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for a review. MY review ... No one else&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not the companies review. My honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m late on giving this review, because I was given the Vitiman C Serum for an HONEST review.  As the saying, &#x27;time will tell&#x27; , is very true in this situation.  My age spot have almost disappeared, my skin is tighter,  pores are smaller, and my complexion is dewey.  Yes, I LOVE THIS....not sticky...does not leave any type of film and will not irritate your skin. YES, THIS ONE IS A KEEPER.  I thank you, my face thanks you, and my pocket book thanks you.)</li>
    <li> It actually is helping my skin tighten up and I am starting to notice smaller wrinkles and clearer skin.....love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 5 days now, my face feels and looks SO much smoother. I spent the week on the beach the week before and It looked a little sun worn and I think using this product I looked so much better. The ONLY reason I did not give it five stars is the smell. It does not agree with me. It could just be my bottle. It does not bother me enough to make me stop using it though. I will keep using it and I will buy more. It is a great product and would recommend it to my friends and anyone else.</li>
    <li> Great product that has truly helped my skin. My face feels so much softer and the dark circles and spots have been reduced! I&#x27;m usually pretty skeptical about products like this, but Radha has made me a believer!</li>
    <li> Now on my third day of using it I feel my face turn worse than before I don&#x27;t know why.. There is small acne start to appear under my skin and I feel burning on my face</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this serum.  It&#x27;s the best!  my skin looks so good even after 1 application.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I like this product. So far, I have not noticed much of a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance except that it seems a little brighter and I am sure that the Vitamin C is good for my skin. The scent is okay and I wish the oil was a little thicker so it would be easier to apply!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this product! It was exactly what my skin needsd. I&#x27;ve got only been using it for a week but I&#x27;m starting to see results. I hope the positive results continue:)</li>
    <li> This serum really makes my skin look great, vitamin C has improved the appearance of my skin, and help diminish the appearance of age spots. The skin is soft and firmer. I can&#x27;t wait to see how my face looks after the bottle is gone.  I highly recommend this treatment for you skin. It also has natural products which I really like. The price is really great for this size bottle.</li>
    <li> Excellent price, directions, and advice+++.  Instant delivery.</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Have used for only 2 days and liking it. :)&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far I enjoy how this serum makes my face feel. I got it discounted to try and review it. I have been using it for a week now. I have never tried any other type of serum so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The smell is OK. When I first put it on it doest feel moisturizing and it&#x27;s not oily like I thought it would be so it doesn&#x27;t easilly glide on ....however I do notice less pigmention the next morning and my skin is a lost softer. I look forward to seeing how it helps my skin in the winter.</li>
    <li> I was sent this product for free for only a review. I like how thin this serum is because it is easily absorbed into my skin. I like how quickly this serums dries. It is also nice that I only use a few drops which the little dropper makes easy.</li>
    <li> Great value and product.  I have used other, more expensive Vit C serums that I did not like as well.</li>
    <li> I am not going to repeat what had been said about benefits of using this. What distinguish this particular Vitamin C serum by Radha is:&lt;br /&gt;1) At 2 oz (60 ml) this is a pretty big sized bottle. My bathroom is full of serums and most are only 1 oz, which is half of this one, but priced similarly.&lt;br /&gt;2) What made a very good impression on me, is that contrary to most of the other serums, this one was foiled when I got it, so if you want to buy a Vitamin C to gift it, get this one. I love opening new packages, so that I know, that nobody touched it before me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C is the best remedy I came across and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product for evaluation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give 3 stars. I really don&#x27;t know for sure if it&#x27;s effective or not. It has a strange smell and is foggy which I think means it is no longer good. I believe vitamin c serum can only stay good for about a week. I have been making my own vitamin c serum and I can really tell how potent it is. It slightly tingles when applied and I only make a small batch that lasts about a week or so.</li>
    <li> After having a professional facial they said to use vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid together, and it seems to make my skin softer and the wrinkles are softened using both  they aren&#x27;t expensive and they help.</li>
    <li> Wish it were really organic. It has an ingredient that is a hormome disruptor in it. Will be returning this item. Was ver excited to try it in my body products but I will not call something organic that&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Very little fading disappeared.  Was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes yet, buy I did just receive the product a few days ago.  The liquid is very light and wears well under my moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a noticeable smell and didn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky on my skin.</li>
    <li> Burns my face. Inflames skin. Tag had been removed from jar and the one you see in the photo added over it. Previous tag adhesive still visable. Very questionable.</li>
    <li> No odor which is great as I am sensitive to some fragrances.  Have moved to a spray bottle as it is easier to apply. Given deal to try but this should not negate my review as I am the first one to complain if I have an issue.  And I have not.  This really softens and firms up my face.</li>
    <li> The bags under my eyes have disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks healthier then ever, evens out complexion</li>
    <li> Received this product with expectations of helping with fine lines, must say it works and I love it.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 bottles, one for my husband and one for myself, we both love it.</li>
    <li> I continue to use this but I&#x27;m not seeing any results.</li>
    <li> Goes on smoothly and decreases fine line and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love this Serum. My skin looks bright, clear and tight after using this product for just a few days. Cant wait to see what my skin looks like after using this for a month or longer! I love the eyedropper feature as well!</li>
    <li> This serum  leaves my skin youthful looking and reduces fine lines and wrinkles even after the first use. The bottle says that it&#x27;s VEGAN hyaluronic acid is the absolute highest quality vitamin c serum available. I don&#x27;t use the serum alone, I followed directions and followed up with a moisturizer and it makes my skin AMAZING. Vitamin c serum does not contain alcohol, parabens or sulfates and is safe for all skin types. Which means that it is ORGANIC and I LOVE that :) I am super duper happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love the product also and how did all these people get a fee bottle I would like to have one also.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great and always makes my skin feel so refreshed and wonderful.  I don&#x27;t have any breakouts or anything from it, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The consistency seems very thin sike water not like a serum. Will try anyway and see what happens</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for this product!  I was given a sample of this product and I am so thankful.  I live in Arizona and the hot desert sun can be unkind to my face.  As the switch to the hot weather occurs, my skin becomes more desert like.  The lines in my forehead seem to become deeper and the fine wrinkles around my eyes are not so fine.  When I smile the &#x27;happy&#x27; marks remain a bit longer despite the fact I am done smiling...Well I&#x27;ve tried this product for almost two weeks now and I am absolutely thrilled.  My wrinkles are less deep and dark and I feel my skin is more elastic, aka not so dry.  It is not a thin watery substance or a thick gooey one either,  it&#x27;s has the same weight as heavy whipping cream.  My nose is very very sensitive so the scent of any product is super important to me.  This has no strong fragrance or odd odor -  Perfect!!  I intent to include this in my skin care routine from now on.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I have tried several Vit C serums and this one is light and sinks right in.  Some others I have tried are sticky and feel tacky.  Will continue to use!!</li>
    <li> Just received this product today.  First impressions, it has a very chemical smell to it.  The package was warm from being out in the sun, so I will give it time to cool down and hopefully the smell will go away.</li>
    <li> Wonderful results! My skin feels smoother and looks brighter. I will continue to use this serum because my skin is looking better every day!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....I can see some brightening of my skin but its not where I want it to be yet...takes a while to get complete results...</li>
    <li> Did not leave my skin sticky like another vitamin c serum I have purchased which I don&#x27;t use anymore. Excellent product. Good to use under moisturizer</li>
    <li> This serum is thinner than the other one I used before. This one is light and non-sticky when applied to the skin. I do see some improvement in my complexion. I also like the glass dropper much better than a pump. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> Wonderful products from athe most responsive seller I&#x27;ve ever dealt with.  I have now experienced 4 different products including the vitamin c serum, rose hip oil and lavender.  I&#x27;ve seen truly remarkable results almost immediately. I recommend these products because they work.</li>
    <li> great the best serum ever</li>
    <li> Great product! Did everything for the face it said it would! No problems with application and the applicator is nice! I use one side of a cotton ball and apply it before my moisturizer though I have applied it by itself! My face feels healthier, smoother, softer, and blemish free even during my roughest times where I would see acne none has shown!</li>
    <li> Just started using the product but already noticed a difference.  The serum is light and absorbs quickly...and the service is awesome.  will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  Great for those who have oily skin.  Absorbs quicky and there is an instant difference.  Going to do a product review on this product! Great buy, low price.</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS SERUM AND HOW IT KEEPS MY FACE SOFT.  i WILL BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> i immediately feel my face is plumped and tightened,  i am now using it on my neck under my arms, and my thighs.  i defineatly see a difference dark spots are gone from my de&#x27;clote, and my arms are tightening,  iam 62 and have tried everything</li>
    <li> I got this at a for free for my review. This is not at all what I expected. I dunno what I was really expecting. It felt kind of heavy on the skin when I first applied it but once it dried my skin felt smoother. I didn&#x27;t see a huge change but I only got to use it once before my review was due. I&#x27;ve been using this a week now and my bags under my eyes are pretty much gone.</li>
    <li> Love the vitamin c serum. My husband even uses it along with my daughter. Great results. I&#x27;ve used more expensive c serum before.I like this tons better. Will definitely re order.</li>
    <li> So far I notice refining of my skin texture, expect to see even more as I have only being&lt;br /&gt;using for about 2 weeks. Years ago I used a different brand of vit c serum and had good&lt;br /&gt;results, that product is no longer available, so hoping this product will do as well and better.&lt;br /&gt;Gave only 3 stars because I need more time to evaluate.</li>
    <li> NOT QUITE THE RESULTS I WANTED BUT A GOOD PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I loved it. I am loving how my neck is beginning to look.</li>
    <li> If we were back in the 1800&#x27;s someone would be selling this on the street as miracle elixir. After seconds of using my skin seems softer. I started using where I get some ingrown hairs and it&#x27;s as if overnight the ingrowns are less inflamed. I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a real change but it makes my face feel soft and as if I have nothing on but then again I&#x27;m only 23 years old so I don&#x27;t think I have a lot of imperfections.</li>
    <li> This product is very thin, and it isn&#x27;t a defect, they advertise that as one of their selling points on the bottle, so don&#x27;t be surprised by that like I was when you open it. It is not as smooth or viscous as other similar products I am used to, but I took a look at the ingredient list and it did seem to have a decent ingredient list. After testing this product, I can say that it is moisturizing but not deeply so, it has a strange lingering after-scent that I wasn&#x27;t fond of, so I do not know how often I will be wanting to use this product, because at first I did not think the smell was strong, but then it turned out that the smell was something I just didn&#x27;t care for. However, each area of skin I tested this product did feel smoother, so this product works, even if it is not my favorite of its type.</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I was super excited when I got it in the mail because I&#x27;ve read the seller&#x27;s info on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a dropper so you can assess how much serum you can put on your face because if you use something else, like a cotton ball, to apply, it would waste the product. I tried it as soon as I got it and it made my face glow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product tingles and tightens skin. The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t smell very good. Another thing was the product doesn&#x27;t tell you how to use it, I got an email from the seller about more info on the product after I received the bottle.</li>
    <li> My skin loves this serum! It is my first purchase and, used in conjunction with Radha&#x27;s Eye Cream and Miracle Retinol Moisturizer, I have seen some pretty dramatic results considering I&#x27;ve only been using the products for a month. With regard to application, be aware that this product is a liquid. Previous serums I&#x27;ve tried were think enough to put directly on my fingertips for application. This product will run right through your fingers. I apply mine by placing the drops in my left hand and dabbing with the fingers on my right. I use 1/2 a dropper twice a day, 1/4 on my face and 1/4 on my neck and deck. As I said, I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and I still have about a half a bottle left, so it goes a long way. My skin seems overall more healthy, fine lines have disappeared and deep wrinkles have softened. I am excited to see the results with ongoing use!</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is an essential for me. I have used Ole&#x27;s and this brand is has better ingredients and performance. The product is of water consistency so be careful dispensing.</li>
    <li> After using this every morning for a week my skin is firmer and smoother. The best part is that the skin on my neck and under my chin are looking tighter.</li>
    <li> A high-performance product.  After only 3 applications now, as a daytime serum, allover facial lines and even pores are already fading.  My skin looks clearer, smoother.  I did not expect such fast results, but I see the difference in a magnifying mirror, in morning light.  The serum itself feels weightless, is fresh smelling, and is absorbed upon contact, in my experience.  This is a quality product and a permanent addition to my skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Best product ever! I have oily skin and I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this serum. And is also perfect for the aging lines on your neck, I can tell you my daughter told me mom you look different!! So try it! You won&#x27;t regret!&lt;br /&gt;I received the product for a honest opinion and I can tell you its true!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with my serum...</li>
    <li> Great product and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> First time using the Vitamin C serum.  Feels radiant on the face, would definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I work with a lot of oils for my aromatherapy and for massage, so when I had the chance to try this for free I jumped for it!  For just using it plain it&#x27;s amazing!  I have combination skin and so have to be careful of using anything too oily but this is absorbed quickly and causes me no problems.  I love using it on my face and my nails.  I&#x27;ve set some aside to work with a couple of specific scents to use for my face when I have migraines and it works amazing!</li>
    <li> Forced to stop using it when it caused a pervasive salty/briny taste (that made all food &amp; drink taste horrible).  Stopped using this serum for two weeks and salty taste eased a bit.  I applied the serum again one night, just to be sure it was the problem, and the salty taste worsened over night.  Had to return the Vitamin C Serum.  Discontinued serum and taste issues completely resolved after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is &amp;#34;Sodium Hyaluronate&amp;#34; and works through chemical reaction; SODIUM attracts and holds water, creating moist, full skin.  Shame I had to stop using the serum.  It definitely helped hydrate the skin when combined with my regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can use this Vitamin C Serum without any problems, the serum will help the skin retain more moisture, feel silky, and appear fuller.  Inspect your bottle; first bottle I received was a rancid, fermenting product. The liquid within the bottle was cloudy, which is normal. But it also had a bubbly, foamy top that never settled, which is not normal.</li>
    <li> I was previously using another Vitamin C cream and as I love the other Radha products I&#x27;ve tried, thought I&#x27;d try theirs.  It&#x27;s only been a couple of days, so I&#x27;m still comparing the effects of this one versus my other one. There are no negative comments on this, I do like it.  Will give it another week to decide if I&#x27;m in love.  My thought is that this is a great product, and if you&#x27;ve never used a Vitamin C serum, you will love it.  I&#x27;m hoping this will be a winner for me, so I can purchase all of my facial care products from Radha.</li>
    <li> this product is light and has a fresh smell. I really like it</li>
    <li> I will start this review by saying I received a coupon to try the product for free if I left a review.  You do not always know what to expect when you get things free.  First, the serum shipped exceptionally fast.  The packaging is secure in a heavy duty cardboard box, as every product I have gotten from Radha in this type glass bottle has been.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is fantastic!  It feels fantastic and light on my skin and I have noticed a remarkable decline in the amount of redness and irritation on my face since I started using this.</li>
    <li> I am really loving the gentle nature of this moisturizing serum. Rather than having some harsh treatment done to my face I can simply wash, dry and apply and it feels wonderful and is helping to even out the texture and color of my face. I like the control I have with the dropper and am so glad to have had the opportunity to try this great product. In fairness, I must say I have received a sample of this product to try and review.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product- I am not being offered anything from the company either.  I have been told that I look 25- which is great, because I&#x27;m 42!  I wish I had known about this a long time ago!  I apply it several times throughout the day and I notice dark spots are much lighter, some are even gone.  It truly is a miracle product!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;Love this serum! Now part of my daily skin care regimine. Highly reccomended!</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF!!!!  The best product at a wonderful price. I use it daily on face and neck. Thanks for offering this highest percent of vitamin C serum. I shall continue ordering from you!</li>
    <li> Radha Beauty has developed the perfect Vitamin C serum.  Light, not greasy, and definitely one of the best brightening serums I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for more than a month and it has cleared my skin of my acne scars... I had previously purchased this but in the little pump container andbthis definitely worls way better... Maybe becaise of the packaging idk but i love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, i have already seen an improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the dropper on this bottle. After using it a for a while I can tell it is working. I am always worries about putting things on my face because I have a greasy face, but it goes on thin without any adverse side effects.</li>
    <li> Just received this product and have used it a few times. I already see some difference in my facial skin. I was a bit concerned as I have issues with many facial products due to roseasa, but so far only a slight tingling and no eruptions. I have also used it on the back of my hands up the arm to the elbow area where I have that &amp;#34;creepy&amp;#34; skin. I see a major difference in just a week. I purchased this product because of the natural ingredients. I am so over the usual companies charging so much for lab created products. I am hoping my results will get even better with time.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It&#x27;s a great value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is suppose to do.. It soaks in well.</li>
    <li> I love that I was able to receive this in order for a review. I used this product on my fact and it works great. It&#x27;s healthy for your skin and really has done more for my skin tone evening than any other product I have tried.</li>
    <li> Serum goes on without irritation and seems to be working, but.need more time to know how effective.</li>
    <li> I am loving this serum! I am applying this every morning after I wash my face and it leaves the skin soft and is brightening it. When I apply my make up after this, I feel like the lines are diminished around my eyes and make things glide on my face easier and look smooth. I am very happy with this purchase! The bottle is high quality and dark (which is good because it keeps the light out and that helps the product stay fresher and more potent longer) and the dropper is very nice. The shipping was fast and this was packaged very thoughtfully so as not to get damaged in shipping. I very much appreciate that. I am loving this product so far and will update review in a few  weeks possibly with before and after pictures.</li>
    <li> Great product up to this point - have only been using it for a few weeks but it does make my face look smoother and evens out my skin tone.  I will post more when I have used it longer.  It hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs at all.</li>
    <li> Its really a good product, i received and tried this for couple of days, but i can see how nice it is. So I&#x27;ll wait for more days or weeks to observe, and then i probably buy more of this. I like the fact, that its a natural and organic, and it helps on my face to look more nice and younger. I used it every morning and night, and when i wake up in the morning my face looks fresh, and glowing.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I can only use this once in a while or my face begins to burn. When I first started using this I could really tell a difference in how my skin looked.  After two weeks use it began to irritate my skin so I backed off and am using it once a week now.</li>
    <li> This serum is very nice fealing, soaks well into the skin and smells great too. I ordered this item off from Amazon review traider and have used it just a short amount of time and already feel that it has decreased visible lines around my eyes. I will continue to use this product every night.</li>
    <li> Best vitamin C serum I have ever used, I am on my second bottle. Helps keep dark freckles (from driving)in check. I love that is leaves your face feeling firm.  It may feel a bit sticky at first but when it is dry you can apply your sunscreen or make-up smoothly. My skin is not sensitive but sometimes it does make my face red, but it subsides quickly. I recommend that one never uses it right after you bathe with warm/hot water.  Doesn&#x27;t really smell. I keep mine in the fridge so it does not oxidize as fast and it feels sooo good on hot days.</li>
    <li> It firms, and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> I love it . I don&#x27;t really have a lot of wrinkles but I can see some improvements on my skin</li>
    <li> Great product! have been using it for almost a month and have noticed a difference already! Using it with Radha beauty miracle moisturizer (Retinol) and noticed dark spots and blemishes fading .Skin is smooth and softer. I ordered another set too :) ... Will for sure recommend to anyone who needs a nice pampered face!!! Thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> My face is clearer and not dry anymore. Just love it. Much better than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> In my late 40&#x27;s and I can see a noticeable difference in my skin tone and texture with this product.</li>
    <li> The Vitamin C Serum leaves your skin feeling so tight and refreshed.  I use it morning and night after washing my face.  It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or the feel of any residue.  There is a lovely fragrance to the serum.  I have been using it for a little over a week now, and seriously can tell there are less wrinkles near my eyes.  I would definitely purchase the Vitamin C Serum again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this serum for you honest opinion.</li>
