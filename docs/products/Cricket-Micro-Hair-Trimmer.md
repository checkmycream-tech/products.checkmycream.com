      <li>It made her skin very smooth and hair free.</li>
      <li>So far this has been a great purchase.</li>
      <li>However with some concealer it can be easily covered up and is not noticeable at all.</li>
      <li>This works and is easy on the skin.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very sturdy, but given the cheap price I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>It worked great first 5 times , just not very powerful and kind of pulls hair , not interned for many uses</li>
      <li>I have the personal touch which I am happy with,  and this works almost as well.</li>
      <li>My original Cricket STILL doesn&#x27;t have any of these problems but died because of the battery..</li>
      <li>Given more thought to use would have been very helpful!</li>
      <li>Not a bad item to shave hair off your face in an emergency.</li>
      <li>Batteries die quickly;  unit stopped working after 4uses</li>
      <li>Removes hair quickly and effortlessly&lt;</li>
      <li>Easy, fast and clean.</li>
      <li>Is great for sensitive facial areas&lt;</li>
      <li>but they are worth the money , what 10/ 15 bucks ?</li>
      <li>Why wax your upper lip if you own this?</li>
      <li>I got it in today, I used it right when I opened the box.</li>
      <li>Great for stray hairs above upper lip.</li>
      <li>I had my first set for 7 years.  </li>
      <li>Not very powerful &amp; it kind of hurts.</li>
      <li>Not the most powerful but works on removing the thin hairs :)</li>
      <li>The first one worked fine for several months.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice little case and seems well made.</li>
      <li>Trims hair very well.  </li>
      <li>I really like the results I get from this product.</li>
      <li>It was bothering her so much, I decided to get the \\&quot;Cricket\\&quot; Hair Trimmer.</li>
      <li>The cricket trimmer is small, cheap and works fine for what I need.  </li>
      <li>Tried new durcell battery still nothing.</li>
      <li>Changed batteries with brand new</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times (I like to trim my nostril hair every few months or so) and experienced no issues.</li>
      <li>I use it frequently and highly recommend the quality and convenience of this product.</li>
      <li>New growth comes in soft without stubble-something I was concerned about.</li>
      <li>We bought this to replace our old one that won&#x27;t work very well after several years.</li>
      <li>Would NEVER waste my money again.</li>
      <li>This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.  </li>
      <li>After about a year it is dead Cheap made in China.</li>
      <li>received this as a Christmas present, and I really like it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok new, but it has a weak motor.</li>
      <li>on my last one I lost the eyebrow attachment so had to buy a new trimmer.</li>
      <li>I mainly use this for facial hair and haven&#x27;t really tried it on any other areas.  </li>
      <li>You have to play around with the clipper blades occasionally because they get stuck but quickly is fixed.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m not very careful</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wax because I get bumps and rashes. This works and is easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> I have been so happy with this trimmer!  Very easy to use.  Compact.  Trims hair very well.  I mainly use this for facial hair and haven&#x27;t really tried it on any other areas.  It comes with guards for eyebrow trimming as well, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than a pair of scissors.</li>
    <li> no battery life at all. only used it once and had to replace the battery. work as described. nice case and attachments.</li>
    <li> great for nose hairs ladies . none of us ladies want that ! I have owned three of these . they don&#x27;t last for ever but they are worth the money , what 10/ 15 bucks ? no nose hairs , period</li>
    <li> Worked for only a short time.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Tried new durcell battery still nothing. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Batteries die quickly;  unit stopped working after 4uses</li>
    <li> Bought 2 and after 2 uses with both they are broken.  Changed batteries with brand new and they just don&#x27;t work..  Would NEVER waste my money again.</li>
    <li> Realiable and lasts several years.  You have to play around with the clipper blades occasionally because they get stuck but quickly is fixed.  I had my first set for 7 years.  Quite a buy</li>
    <li> This is the quickest and easiest way to trim unwanted neck hair, etc. I use it frequently and highly recommend the quality and convenience of this product. I ordered extras for friends who agree it is a must.</li>
    <li> works as I want.. No complaints</li>
    <li> Not a quality product or even close.....This stopped working after one use.  A waste of time and money. Shame on amazon for offering.</li>
    <li> This is the second Cricket Micro Hair Trimmer I have purchased through Amazon.  The first one worked fine for several months.  The second one lasted about 3 weeks.  It is great when it works but the longevity is a problem.</li>
    <li> So far this has been a great purchase. I&#x27;ve used it a few times (I like to trim my nostril hair every few months or so) and experienced no issues. It has a nice little case and seems well made. I haven&#x27;t gotten cut or hurt at all and I&#x27;m not very careful, I just stick it up my nose and run it around the walls of my nostril, removing it to wipe off hair every few passes. Great product. If it lasts a year or more I&#x27;ll be happy, and I will repurchase.</li>
    <li> The cricket trimmer is small, cheap and works fine for what I need.  I only use it to trim the little hairs which sneak out the nostrils.  It isn&#x27;t very sturdy, but given the cheap price I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I got this for an elderly woman who has some facial hair. It was bothering her so much, I decided to get the \\&quot;Cricket\\&quot; Hair Trimmer. I have the personal touch which I am happy with,  and this works almost as well. It made her skin very smooth and hair free. It made her happy, so I am happy too.</li>
    <li> It worked great first 5 times , just not very powerful and kind of pulls hair , not interned for many uses</li>
    <li> This worked one time and then when it came time to use it again it was broken. It is Junk</li>
    <li> This product is not fancy but is the same unit sold with various brand names. on my last one I lost the eyebrow attachment so had to buy a new trimmer. Just snap on the guide and trim. I would give it 5 stars if they had a AA battery one with a little more power, these AAA trims tend to get weak after some use.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years to do all kinds of trimming and haven&#x27;t found anything better! Just try one!</li>
    <li> The blades are not the greatest and it feels to light.  Given more thought to use would have been very helpful!</li>
    <li> This item was recommended to me by a friend.  Then after I purchased it and tried it out, I knew why!  It exceeded my expectations for facial hair removal.  New growth comes in soft without stubble-something I was concerned about.</li>
    <li> Does the job! Not the most powerful but works on removing the thin hairs :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really slick!  Works perfectly for a good price and is much better for my face than using products like Nair.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace our old one that won&#x27;t work very well after several years. I like the pouch to hold the cleaning brush and the attachment and I also like that it has a lid to put on when not using it. We both have used it and agree that it does the job.</li>
    <li> I got it in today, I used it right when I opened the box. It works great and was shipped fast. My face is very smooth and I dont have unwanted hair anymore. I would give it a 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect product for trimming your eyebrows.  Just put on the guard and voila!</li>
    <li> Not very powerful &amp; it kind of hurts. I bought this one because of the Cricket branding, i can&#x27;t believe they would make such a crappy product. Overall works okay.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok new, but it has a weak motor. After about a year it is dead Cheap made in China.</li>
    <li> Great for stray hairs above upper lip. Easy, fast and clean.</li>
    <li> Not a close shave but does the trick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Is great for sensitive facial areas&lt;br /&gt;• Removes hair quickly and effortlessly&lt;br /&gt;• Is water resistant (found out accidentally)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Leaves “stubble”&lt;br /&gt;• Razor gets clogged easily&lt;br /&gt;• Razor vibrates extremely slowly&lt;br /&gt;• Needs touchups about once a week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this as a Christmas present, and I really like it. I use it to trim and pluck my eyebrows. This little razor saves me trips to the salon and a lot of money. I really like the results I get from this product. It does the job, but it does leave a small amount of stubble behind. However with some concealer it can be easily covered up and is not noticeable at all. The carrying case is convenient, too. I recommend this!</li>
    <li> I wish the eyebrow trimmer was shorter. I don&#x27;t like that I have to change heads to do the eye brow and then regular trimming. It also seems kind of cheap.</li>
    <li> Not a bad item to shave hair off your face in an emergency. Does not hurt, which it is good. Glad I got it.</li>
    <li> Works great and is very cute and travel sized to its easy to bring anywhere without being embarrassed :) :D</li>
    <li> Neat little tool. Works great for trimming</li>
    <li> This is a product I&#x27;ve used for years with complete satisfaction.  Now, all my family members and close friends have one.</li>
    <li> Gift for wife, no complaints</li>
    <li> Replaced one I already had. Happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product is absolutely wonderful. Works really well at hard to get areas</li>
    <li> Excellent product. All have held up well. My daughter is a hair stylist and I&#x27;ve introduced her to Cricket. She loves it.</li>
    <li> Used twice and quit working</li>
    <li> Why wax your upper lip if you own this? Great product once you have a cricket you can&#x27;t use a inexpensive one, it doesn&#x27;t compare. Have extra batteries on hand.</li>
    <li> I had brought a cricket from another company and it was GREAT!  This product is &amp;#34;fragile&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m using it.  It isn&#x27;t as strong and it seems to &amp;#34;vibrate&amp;#34; much more and it seems to &amp;#34;split&amp;#34; apart at times.  My original Cricket STILL doesn&#x27;t have any of these problems but died because of the battery..</li>
