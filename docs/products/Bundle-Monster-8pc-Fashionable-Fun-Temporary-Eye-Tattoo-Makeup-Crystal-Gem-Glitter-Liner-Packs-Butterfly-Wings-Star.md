      <li>Thank you for a great bunch of products to experiment with.</li>
      <li>Great product, though it takes a bit of skill and patience to apply.</li>
      <li>Would order again, great for festivals.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product!!  </li>
      <li>Keep up the good work</li>
      <li>These are so cute!</li>
      <li>This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a nice collection which again is nice for the Goddess Worshiper&#x27;s because every element and Goddess aspect is represented.</li>
      <li>and honestly I forget I am wearing them.</li>
      <li>Designs are awesome, and they hold very well.</li>
      <li>You kind of have to master applying these...</li>
      <li>but if as easy to apply as all others I am sure they will be good</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product to try, gives you cool looking intricate designs you&#x27;ll often see with paper eyelashes.</li>
      <li>These are to cute and easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Absolutely adorable.  </li>
      <li>and you will be seeing more of my business...</li>
      <li>I ended up looking like Mike Tyson from Bachelor Party but still a good, fun project.</li>
      <li>I bought them to wear for a sexy evening on a weekend get away with my husband.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a STUNNING look for about 1 minute&#x27;s worth of work!  </li>
      <li>However, they can be used for many occasions and are definitely worth the price!</li>
      <li>and they were easy to apply and remove.</li>
      <li>I really love how easy they are to use and how quick I&#x27;ve received them.</li>
      <li>but I caught on quick.  </li>
      <li>These are super neat.</li>
      <li>Used these as a fun craft for the teens/adults at a party.  </li>
      <li>I had no trouble removing them either with a healthy dose of baby oil and some cotton balls.  </li>
      <li>so they are still worth it.</li>
      <li>Just the right amount of items to test and have fun with.  </li>
      <li>These eye tattoo&#x27;s are really pretty and so much fun to wear.  </li>
      <li>They arrived very fast in the mail.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Application is a bit tricky at first.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them to busy witches who are planning huge Sabbat ceremonies.</li>
      <li>A little bit of this and a little bit of that is the perfect combination for these items.  </li>
      <li>They are very tricky to apply.</li>
      <li>They make your makeup application fast</li>
      <li>but they all look really neat.</li>
      <li>If the liners were visible on the backside of paper it would make it much easier</li>
      <li>The only draw back is that they look a little more bright and vivid in the picture than what they really are.</li>
      <li>These are very pretty and if you are not very good at putting on eye shadow but love to show those eyes off this is defiantly the product for you.</li>
      <li>They arrived on time and are exactly as described, have used two so far</li>
      <li>These are definitely for a bold look.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you hold them on for at least a minute to ensure they stick.</li>
      <li>The strips must be cut out completely to align preciselt along the eyelidd and even then the application is tricky.</li>
      <li>Some of the stones completely had the glue rubbed off.</li>
      <li>Overall, decent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also kind of hard to level each tattoo with the other.</li>
      <li>They make dramatic eye make up so easy.</li>

    <li> I LOVE this product!!  I bought them to wear for a sexy evening on a weekend get away with my husband.  It&#x27;s a STUNNING look for about 1 minute&#x27;s worth of work!  I had no trouble removing them either with a healthy dose of baby oil and some cotton balls.  I will be buying these again!</li>

    <li> these are awesome have lots of photo shoots coming up that I will be using them for</li>
    <li> These are definitely for a bold look.  You kind of have to master applying these...because if you get it wrong...there&#x27;s no way to fix it and you&#x27;re out of a tattoo not having a second identical pair to use.  However, they can be used for many occasions and are definitely worth the price!</li>
    <li> My daughter is in the Lion King musical and the Orange, red, and black appliqué is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;The eyeliner tattoos is perfect for a girl/gangmember/ or even Egyptian costume.&lt;br /&gt;The tattos go on easily, stay on, but are a little hard to get off little kids.</li>

    <li> These eye tattoo&#x27;s are really pretty and so much fun to wear.  They come in different colors and designs.  I had a hard time applying them at first but I caught on quick.  I would definitely recommend these for someone to wear out on the town!</li>
    <li> Used these as a fun craft for the teens/adults at a party.  I ended up looking like Mike Tyson from Bachelor Party but still a good, fun project.</li>
    <li> Using them for recital😃</li>
    <li> These are to cute and easy to apply! I highly recommend them to busy witches who are planning huge Sabbat ceremonies.

There is a nice collection which again is nice for the Goddess Worshiper&#x27;s because every element and Goddess aspect is represented. We bought ours for our Grove&#x27;s Beltane ceremony and the butterflies are perfect for our Witchlings who are taking their Vows.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to put these on yet but they all look really neat. I got them for my Halloween costume but if I were younger I would totally wear them out to a club.</li>
    <li> They wrinkled and make your eye itch! They are like fake tattoos but stiffer! Would not buy again</li>
    <li> Would order again, great for festivals.</li>
    <li> These are so cute! They make dramatic eye make up so easy. Just apply and go.</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and are exactly as described, have used two so far and they were easy to apply and remove.</li>
    <li> Have not used these yet but if as easy to apply as all others I am sure they will be good</li>
    <li> Great product, though it takes a bit of skill and patience to apply.</li>
    <li> These are super neat. Make sure you hold them on for at least a minute to ensure they stick. They are like fake tattoos. they last awhile if you don&#x27;t mess with them. The rhinestones were all over the place in their packaging film and the glue was all over the place. Some of the stones completely had the glue rubbed off. Overall, decent.</li>
    <li> This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get three packs of eye tattoos - one pair of crystal eye tattoos (in one pack), five pairs of decorative eye tattoos (in another pack) and two sheets containing four pairs of eyeliner tattoos each (in the third pack). You get lots of product for a very small price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is a bit tricky at first. It&#x27;s also kind of hard to level each tattoo with the other. Also, after application the tattoo will feel sticky. You may have to retouch the eyeliner line with regular eyeliner in bald spots (idk if it maybe due to faulty tattoo application).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s a good product to try, gives you cool looking intricate designs you&#x27;ll often see with paper eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Difficult to apply and position correctly. The strips must be cut out completely to align preciselt along the eyelidd and even then the application is tricky. If the liners were visible on the backside of paper it would make it much easier</li>
    <li> Mine eyes have seen the glory&lt;br /&gt;But the glory didn&#x27;t stay&lt;br /&gt;with one fell swoop&lt;br /&gt;My stars were washed away</li>
    <li> I never could get one set on - used them up and washed them up.&lt;br /&gt;I even had my sister try to apply them on me - nope, didn&#x27;t work.  Just wasted my money/</li>
    <li> Absolutely adorable.  Just the right amount of items to test and have fun with.  A little bit of this and a little bit of that is the perfect combination for these items.  Delivered on a Sunday!  Thank you for a great bunch of products to experiment with.</li>
    <li> Little confusing on how to put them on</li>
    <li> Designs are awesome, and they hold very well. They are very tricky to apply.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use them on my daughter for her sping musical. It will be the perfect accent for her character!</li>
