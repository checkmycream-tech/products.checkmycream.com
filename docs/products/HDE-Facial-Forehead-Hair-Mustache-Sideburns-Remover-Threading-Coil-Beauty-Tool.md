      <li>I am so glad I added this to my order!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>;) That shiesse hurts!!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still working with it, but it seems to be great at removing the fine, downy hairs that ....</li>
      <li>This thing is truly amazing.</li>
      <li>The price was amazing  -  </li>
      <li>This is nice</li>
      <li>Well, this device works by catching the hairs in between the springs which makeup the device.</li>
      <li>ok, its a GOOD PRODUCT AND IT</li>
      <li>I liked the concept of something I could carry around with me and pull out as needed.  </li>
      <li>While my outer brow/forehead would warm flush feeling (no pain used to threading there</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, but had one before and liked it.  </li>
      <li>It came with the pouch, which is nice for storage.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t know what else you will need from this kind of product</li>
      <li>I liked the product.</li>
      <li>But this thing kind of works.</li>
      <li>This one is actually good quality, and comes with a better velvet pouch the the Spring Sprong and it&#x27;s 1/3 the price.</li>
      <li>time when i ordered, i got a velvet pouch- which is nice to have, keeps it covered.</li>
      <li>I liked this.</li>
      <li>Did I mention it comes with its own velvet pouch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find that a bright light, a magnifying mirror and a good pair of tweezers is faster and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does hurt but as the saying goes you have to suffer to be beautiful right??</li>
      <li>Once you learned how to use it correctly, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Used the 19.98 one a friend had first - this one works just as good!</li>
      <li>It pulled those fine hairs out by the roots and lasted for a good month before I started to notice regrowth.</li>
      <li>I liked it more than waxing.</li>
      <li>But, I was pleasantly surprised because it works great!  </li>
      <li>Honestly, I did have my doubts when I purchased it, because of the cheap price, but once I received it in the mail and tried it, it worked wonders!</li>
      <li>It does a great job around the lip and cheek areas, and it&#x27;s fun learning how to use it...</li>
      <li>It is better to just bleach the hair honestly...</li>
      <li>takes a lil bit practice, once u learn , its the easiest , most effective and quickest way to get rid of those unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found that it worked great for the hair on my upper lip, as I had great control of it in that area</li>
      <li>nice try at this product, its ok, and it does work, and is better than tweezing each hair out, but it still takes time just like a tweezer</li>
      <li>(it removes arm hair very easily we found out :)).</li>
      <li>product is super affordable and works just as good as the pricier competitors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a good way to get rid of hair- at first it hurts but you get use to it.</li>
    <li> HURTS!  R u kissing- just get a tweezers</li>
    <li> The product really works, but you need to man up and have the courage to do it :p, especially on the upper lip.</li>
    <li> serious torture device...I gotta find this thing again...  it&#x27;ll get the hair... you gotta find the right way to hold it.... seriously one of the major faux pas women do.... leave all that hair on your face. I live in California... that sun reflection will show off all that hair... get it off ladies!</li>
    <li> I chose this threader because it was cheap and the shipping was free. I don&#x27;t really know the difference between this one or the expensive ones. Having never tried this before, it was a bit tricky at first. After a few unsuccessful tries I adjusted the angle of the threader and it worked like a charm (it really hurts though). For those who say it doesn&#x27;t work, try adjusting the angle. Instead of a \\&quot;u\\&quot; shape try elongating it. It literally took me 2 minutes to figure it out. After I was finished my skin was pretty red. Aloe vera lotion helped with the sting, and the redness was gone after 10 minutes. For the price this is totally worth it, it&#x27;s much faster than tweezing.</li>
    <li> I love this little thing, it removes the hair quickly and easily, and was considerably cheaper than some other similar products that I found ( I saw one that was almost 19 dollars, a bit ridiculous for a little spring)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HDE shipped quickly and it arrived with the free pouch in the description&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item is not the color shown in the picture, mine is a pastel pink, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter anyway, and the instructions on the package it came in were in Chinese...</li>
    <li> I had a lot of trouble getting this to work. It seems of decent quality, but the spring just didn&#x27;t seem to want to grab the thicker hairs on my face. If you have fine hair you want to remove this will probably be fine.</li>
    <li> I paid $30 every 10 days to get threaded at the salon and now I don&#x27;t have to.  This product is so amazing I am not having to pay someone else to remove my facial hair, I can do it myself.  Leaves my face so smooth and removes the hair from the root.  I am so glad I ordered it that I am actually going to order a few more in case I ever lose it I will have back ups.  I highly recommend this product but you may want to get a couple cause your going to love it.</li>
    <li> This is easy to use and really does the job of getting those un slightly  chin hairs.</li>
    <li> THIS THING DON\\&quot;T REMOVE HAIR AT ALL!!! BETTER OFF USEING A RAZOR..WORKS BETTER..AND FASTER..DON\\&quot;T BUY THIS THING..U WILL BE WAISTING UR MONEY FOR SURE</li>
    <li> The device is much more flexible than I anticipated but this is not a bad thing. It seems durable enough and I am glad for the ease of use. It does hurt but only for a second like pulling a band aid off the quicker the better. It is a \\&quot;make your eyes water\\&quot; quick pain,  not a \\&quot;scream\\&quot; pain, so its worth it, especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that it did not come with the velvet pouch that it advertised though. The shipping was rather quick and seems to be an otherwise okay product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks: like the picture but mine has pink handles.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: an easy to open cardboard and plastic package written in foreign language but with pictures of how to use so not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping: received well with in the time expected and came in a standard gray shipping bag.&lt;br /&gt;Durability: Flexible no obvious flaws as of yet.&lt;br /&gt;Ease of use: super easy a child could use it but I would recommend keeping out of reach of children as if caught in long hair I imagine it would be fairly hard to remove with out pain or scissors!</li>
    <li> First off, this thing came to my mailbox 3 days before the \\&quot;scheduled time\\&quot; which just makes the product that much better. I opened it quickly and immediately tried it out; following the instructions from the other reviews. OUCH! So after I ran to the fridge and got some ice to numb my lip, it wasn&#x27;t so bad. After about 15 minutes of using the product, most of my upper lip hair was gone. Also, the redness disappeared within a few minutes.   All in all, great product. Its the cost (w/shipping) of about one trip to the salon for waxing, so i feel its definitely worth it.   I rated it down to 4 stars cause the shipping was more than the product(that&#x27;s more of an amazon issue) and it was super painful the first time. I&#x27;m not a wimp either, I get my cavities drilled without Novocaine. I&#x27;m BA like that.  ...but it really did hurt.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after reading nearly all of the reviews, and was optimistic about it. However, this was a waste of money; it honestly does absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> The product did as it advertised.  It did come with the little black bag as it said it would.</li>
    <li> i guess its thiker in away. Shorter than the epicare nothing compairse to my lil 13 dollar stick of magic but I was tight (really really tight) on money and decided on this. Not woth it but if you are a first time user on this kind of hair remover you might just like it. Did come with a velvet pouch and it came sooner than expected. Overall cool but not for me.</li>
    <li> I just received this, but having epilated before I don&#x27;t think there are any unpleasant surprises to come... This is tricky and I had to do some experimenting before it really began to work. It is going to take a few times to master. It DOES hurt, especially when I was getting impatient that it wasn&#x27;t removing the hairs closest to my upper lip and I placed it in an upside down U around my lip line and pulled upwards - well, it worked! Re. the negative review, I would be surprised if the REM Spring really works that much better than this(??). So if you are curious about how these work &amp; don&#x27;t want to spend that much, try this.      I will say that what I received did not come with a velvet pouch so in case you want that, beware, and was in a package with all Japanese on it, no other instructions. (as it was cheap enough &amp; I wasn&#x27;t that bothered I didn&#x27;t complain to the seller to be fair to them). It is called the Super DONO Stick.:-)  There was just a picture that shows to put it in a U and roll the ends outwards in opposite directions while moving it upwards.  Having read reviews of similar products it seems that with experimentation you can find other ways so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll be doing.    So far it is no more irritating than other methods (seems a bit less so than waxing or epilation, certainly with a body epilator!!). I put a cold washcloth on the whole area after and then put aloe vera gel on.  You have more control than waxing (if you get it working) but a facial epilator of course is quicker. So far, NOT painless but I&#x27;ll keep it up.  :-)</li>
    <li> I saw the Bellabe advertised and was about to buy it when I saw this model which appears to work exactly the same way.  I just got it this morning.  I can honestly say that my upper lip is now quite smooth and free of hair.  But it was not pain free.    I&#x27;m still working with it, but it seems to be great at removing the fine, downy hairs that .... ahem... some women of a certain age find sprouting on our chins and cheeks.    It takes a few minutes to get the hang of this, but in less than 10 minutes, I&#x27;d figured it out finished my upper lip.  I see from youtube examples that if you use this regularly, it becomes less painful.  I think it&#x27;s worth the sting but hope the other reviewers are right.</li>
    <li> Look I used this product, I actually love hair removal springs but this one is too long it should be shorter so you and turn it and get the hairs out, its not a difficult concept hair springs work, I really think this one length wise is too long</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fast and as described.&lt;br /&gt;The black velvet cloth case was included so I&#x27;m not sure why some have commented it didn&#x27;t come with.&lt;br /&gt;This product is super affordable and works just as good as the pricier competitors.&lt;br /&gt;I found it super easy to use.  If uncertain there are videos online you can search.&lt;br /&gt;Safe to use as often as you want.&lt;br /&gt;Removes hair at the root so hair takes longer to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Ouch factor:&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m used to the way threading feels and this was still pretty painful the first couple of times.  That is probably because it is so thorough.&lt;br /&gt;You cannot use it on eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;-This product is made to take out large sections of hair not small areas so you cannot do the detailing required for brows.&lt;br /&gt;Can be time consuming&lt;br /&gt;-I thread my whole face and the first time it took me about 40 min to get as hair free as I wanted.  Now I just do touch ups but it is not the fastest method out there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did everything I&#x27;d hoped.  Hair removal at the root that is easy and sanitary.  I recommend cleaning tool with 99% alcohol before and after.  the only reason I rate it less than 5 stars is because it can be so time consuming.</li>
    <li> This item is not like waxing! It&#x27;s no ten second thing. It is more like tweezing without as much concentrated pain and much faster.</li>
    <li> The price was amazing  -  I&#x27;m trying to save money on going to the salon but I think I will just keep going.  Maybe I&#x27;m not using it correctly, but I really don&#x27;t find it very useful.  If you are curious - go ahead and try it (for the price) and make your own decision. It was recommended to me by a friend who happens to love it so i could be wrong here.</li>
    <li> it is very hard to use or i guess im not used to it yet can hardly get any hair out dont feel any pain</li>
    <li> I liked the product. I have lot of facial hair and using it though hurts a bit but it pulls out hair from the root.It does not remove every hair. More specific for people with peach hair.</li>
    <li> great but painful in sensitive areas like lip area.....otherwise great....i&#x27;ve already bought them for all the women in my family and we&#x27;ve been saving money from the salons!!!!</li>
    <li> Works, not great though. It feels like it grabs the hair but doesn&#x27;t pull it out, unless you catch really long hairs. And it does NOT come in a velvet pouch.</li>
    <li> Does hurt at first, but very effective. Once you get used to it, it can work wonders! At first I didn&#x27;t know how to twist it, but when you get it it&#x27;s easy!</li>
    <li> After I had my first child. I started getting these random hairs on my chin. Tweezing took forever, waxing didn&#x27;t remove them, and shaving was just pointless. This does the trick once you get the hang of it. It is painful and you will get teary eyed the first time but soon you get use to it and can&#x27;t wait to feel a hair being snatched.</li>
    <li> This item was an okay item, however it bummed me out that the bottoms where you twist could pop off. But the people that you order from email you back when you have any questions with your order. Ummm.. I think once I get the hang of working with the product, I&#x27;ll be happier. overall pretty good product. TOTALLY WOULD BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!! RECEIVED MY ITEM IN QUICK TIME!</li>
    <li> I just got this product in the mail and tested it out right away. This will pick up the tiniest peach fuzz on your face, you just have to play with the angles a bit til you get the hang of it. The less you curve it, the smaller the hair it will pick up.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer. This is way better than tweezing and wayyyy less messy than waxing.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be amazed by how much hair you actually have on your face.  I originally purchased this product for my upper lip but before I knew I was addicted and started to do all over my face.   The technique does need a little getting used to but it is very easy.  I have never tried any other products like this so I can not compare it to that.  It is small so it&#x27;s easy to maneuver on the upper lip...the face takes a little more time.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for any other part of your body though.  The springs pull out the hairs by roots instead of just breaking them which is great!  It does hurt a bit the first time you use it...but you quickly get used to it.  Happy Threading! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This hair remover works wonderfully.  It gets nearly every hair (it misses a few here and there, but not many), and if you can deal with the pain of plucking, you can definitely deal with this.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much as plucking (probably because it takes less time), and some areas are a bit more painful than others (mainly the upper lip).</li>
    <li> Works really well! I got it today, and I was surprised how well it got all the really fine hairs on my face.</li>
    <li> It takes a while to get used to buts its a pretty good product for the price. I&#x27;ve only used it once so far, and since I haven&#x27;t completely gotten the hang of it, it took a while. Don&#x27;t let anyone tell you it doesn&#x27;t hurt, because it always does, unless your not pulling out the hairs. I just think that its more hairs per pain level, especially if you you compare to tweezers.    By the way, it ships from like China (all the packaging material is in Chinese) and has no pouch, but then I didn&#x27;t expect it.</li>
    <li> The packaging &amp; shipping was awesome! It arrived early and I was very pleased.  UNFORTUNATELY, after months of having this product I have come to the conclusion that it sucks.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the hair I want.  I got it for my upper lip.  It removes all the tiny blonde hair that I can hardly even see and leaves all the visible black hair.  I am extremely dissapointed and will not be purchasing another spring hair removal product! It is better to just bleach the hair honestly... this product did NOT deliver after continuous use.</li>
    <li> I have this one. It&#x27;s just okay.  Bought it as a backup since it was so much cheaper than the original Epicare.  I hate to say it but the original one is better.  This one is too thick in my opinion and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  There&#x27;s a reason why the Epicare is $15 and this one 50 cents!</li>
    <li> PENSE QUE NO FUNCIONARIA PERO FUNCIONA EXCELENTE , ME QUITA EL BELLO MUCHO MAS RAPIDO QUE OCN PINZA Y SIN CERA ADEMAS DE QUE EL DOLOR NO ES TANTO EL QUE SSE SUFRE Y EN MUCHO MENOS TIEMPO... LO RECOMIENDO MUY BUENO.</li>
    <li> I have lots of fine, tiny hairs and this is way too painful for me. Maybe if I just had a couple of dark hairs, it would work better. I&#x27;ve been waxed and it didn&#x27;t hurt anything like this.</li>
    <li> I finally got around to ordering this threading tool and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week to get a few stray hairs off my face that were bothering me.  It is not the best quality I&#x27;ve ever seen- the spring itself is a lot floppier than one other I have used that was MUCH more expensive, but since I don&#x27;t really feel the need to invest a great deal of money into this tool, it gets the job done and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to break any time soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the spring-type threading tools because the design is a lot easier to use on yourself than traditional threading- and it does work, though you should not expect miracles.  If you have a lot of fine hair to get rid of, you will likely have to go over it a few times.  I suggest taking breaks, too, unless you&#x27;re used to ripping the hair out by the root- it lets your skin rest a bit.  Also be sure to put on a moisturizer to soothe the area after you&#x27;re done, just like you would after shaving or waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handles on the end do feel like they wiggle and rotate a little bit, but so far it hasn&#x27;t affected the use of the tool.  I would not personally bother to spring for the more expensive version; this one does just fine.</li>
    <li> When I first tried to use this product, NOTHING happened.  I was so upset because I felt it was a waste.  However, then I twirled the ends the OTHER direction and it worked brilliantly!  It takes a few times to get the hang of using it but it&#x27;s very effective.      It removes almost all of the hair except for the very shortest ones.    I will say that it is painful but that&#x27;s just part of the processing of pulling out hair!    I love mine and think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> These things HURT. Not to mention, you have to use it quite a bit to get all of your unwanted hair. This is my first experience with a hair remover of this type....so I am unsure if it is because it&#x27;s cheap, or something similar. A plus is, it is REALLY easy to use. The package it came in wasn&#x27;t even in English, but the two step pictures do the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m keeping it. I&#x27;m hoping I will get used to the pain, and it&#x27;s cheaper than waxing, and portable.&lt;br /&gt;Fingers crossed!</li>
    <li> It works. It keeps hair gone for three to four weeks. It&#x27;s essentially a super fast way of tweezing/plucking so yes, it is not going to be painless.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest starting around the bottom lip and cheek area to get use to the sensation of sharp pain. Then work your way towards the most sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well worth learning how to get used to the pain. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of other methods like actually individually tweezing, hair removal creams, and waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this this tool over all of them. It works better and requires less maintenance!</li>
    <li> The threader tends to break hairs off while pulling others out.  It isn&#x27;t especially painful, but it&#x27;s also ineffective and time consuming.</li>
    <li> I bought this on pretty much impulse because it was cheap more than anything. I waxed before, and it was always a bit of a mess, so I stopped as it got to be more of a hassle. It came promptly, as Amazon products and Amazon fulfilled products do, so I was pretty excited to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how you can say it doesn&#x27;t work, because I got it on the first try. It works very well, but of course, there&#x27;s the pain factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to know is how you would clean it though: the hair gets trapped in the spring itself, and I don&#x27;t want to risk pulling the handles off if they&#x27;re not meant to be detachable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise, I think it&#x27;s a very good six dollars spent.</li>
    <li> This is nice but it&#x27;s painful to use and it doesn&#x27;t remove as much hair you have to keep doing it in the same spot. Don&#x27;t recommend if your skin is sensitive.</li>
    <li> I got one of these and thought oh how inexpensive!!! I got it in the mail all exited as I am with all things from amazon ;) That shiesse hurts!!!! it&#x27;s crazy. I was crying. No thanks.. it is now collecting dust in my closet.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised that it actually worked.  A little painful at times, but i was told &amp;#34;beauty is pain&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I got this for my \\&quot;moustache\\&quot; and I have to say it gets the job done! It sure does hurt like hell though. However, I get excited feeling the pain knowing I won&#x27;t have to deal with those pesky hairs for awhile. I usually wax first and go over the area with this to get all that I missed. *Tip* Go through the pain and do a full twist. It&#x27;s difficult not to pull it away when you feel the first few hairs rip out but if you do a full rotation it gets all the hairs! Proof is in the springs!</li>
    <li> I have not \\&quot;mastered\\&quot; the technique of how to use this device yet, but I am still trying.  I think it will work nicely on the finer hairs, but not the short stiff ones.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS which causes a lot of facial hair. I have been on a quest to find something affordable with the results of waxing. THIS IS IT! Once you get the hang of rolling this, just roll it all over your face and it yanks your hair out. The only place it tends to be pretty painful is on the upper lip, otherwise it&#x27;s not bad at all. After my first day of using this I could not believe how soft and nice my face felt. For under four dollars you just can&#x27;t beat this. Plus it is not messy and you can do this anywhere. No more shelling out 30+ bucks for waxing! Yay!</li>
    <li> This product works great the only down fall is that some of the smaller short hairs are hard to get. when you flatten  that spring more than the curve it seems to grab more of the shorter hairs. you do have to go over the same spot at least   twice. It can become addicting i do it at home all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve waited a few months before making this review (Bought Oct 2011).  And have come to the conclusion that I&#x27;m way to hairy for this little spring thing. It&#x27;s good for the upper lip and other little jobs.  For me I have alot of hair. It will usually get few stray hairs but it has never gotten everything even when trying to change angles. Also its really time consuming for someone like myself.  Pain-wise depends on you.  For me the upper lip/inner brow will sting to the point my eyes would water.  While my outer brow/forehead would warm flush feeling (no pain used to threading there I guess).  Now I think it&#x27;s time to start looking at a good Epilator.  I give this a 3 stars since it does work. \\&quot;It&#x27;s ok\\&quot; but just wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
    <li> nice try at this product, its ok, and it does work, and is better than tweezing each hair out, but it still takes time just like a tweezer but thats ok, its a GOOD PRODUCT AND IT WORKS</li>
    <li> I thought, what do I have to lose since I do use a threading device on a regular basis. I found the spaces on the *spring* to be too far apart, unlike the more expensive ones. To the naked eye, they apear to be the same, except a little shorter in length, but it just doesn&#x27;t do the same quality of job of the Epicare product. I have purchased all makes out there and this didn&#x27;t extract any hair, but a few.  YES, I know how to use them, unfortunately. It also didn&#x27;t arrive in it&#x27;s *free* black velvet pouch.</li>
    <li> As a guy who has  too much facial hair I use this about once a week and find that pretty soon I won&#x27;t have to use it as much. I like how quickly it removes all the hair I just wish it wasn&#x27;t such a girly color. A gender neutral color would be nice like black or white, but. Anyways if it works for me it will work great for anyone, glad I didn&#x27;t buy those more expensive ones. This one does the work just fine</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as painful as I thought it would be and it works very well. If you use it every week it becomes less and less work as they don&#x27;t all grow back. I love it</li>
    <li> I am so excited that this actually works! I don&#x27;t see why there are negative views on this product, because it it works so well, it&#x27;s all about technique. Honestly, I did have my doubts when I purchased it, because of the cheap price, but once I received it in the mail and tried it, it worked wonders! I had a few ingrown hairs on my chin along with hair in general, and hair on my upper lip, and this facial remover tool took out every single strand, STRAIGHT FROM THE ROOT! The pain is not even that bad either, it&#x27;s just a tiny pinch and very bearable. I am extremely satisfied, and I would definitely recommenced it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is handy and works very well.  I keep one in my my travel case.   It saves the time of going to the salon for waxing , which a plus point for me.</li>
    <li> I read several reviews and decided to give it a shot since it was so inexpensive. Unfortunately, it removed only 5 hairs in 20 minutes of use and just pulled on the rest. So instead of a smooth hair-free face, I have  super irritated skin and still have all the light fuzz. Sounds like a good idea, but it does not work.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s difficult to pull the hair out and roll the coils. If you are successful- then it does work. I find that the only places I can successfully use it is my upper lip. Otherwise, it is far too difficult to maneuver. If I could do it again, I would buy a much finer gauged coil.</li>
    <li> The instructions aren&#x27;t in English, so you&#x27;re left to try to figure it out on your own how to use hence why I took off one star, but once you nail the technique down, this product works amazingly well! I love it and I am very glad I bought!</li>
    <li> It will put tears in your eyes but it does what it says it will do. It&#x27;s worth the \\&quot;ouchies\\&quot; for a bit to get a tedious grooming need done in a flash. It takes some practice to get the hang of using remover, a few minutes playing with it tho was all. I&#x27;ve found if I ice the area for a bit with an ice cube, then dry the area well before I use the tool, it does take some of the sting out. It will also leave a bit of redness but that fades pretty quick.</li>
    <li> I LOVE This product!!!!! I could go on and on!! I am so happy to not have to wax my face anymore. I think for $3.50 it is a steal! I was able to totally irradicate all of my facial hair in about 45 minutes last night. I hadn&#x27;t waxed or plucked in almost a year..(my face isn&#x27;t THAT bad..) but I still had light brown hair and I HATED it. I am olive complected so my hair isn&#x27;t blonde on my face which is so gross to me, but I am short on time and cash. but this little miracle solved my problem! I was even able to sit and watch tv while using it. I hate waxing b/c it takes forever and I usually don&#x27;t have time so I put it off! Not anymore!! No more excuses for me. My husband noticed an immediate difference..and then he went on about it a little too much. LOL..buy this its worth it! Oh and I did get a little velvet pouch with it.</li>
    <li> I just got my Threading Beauty Tool in the mail and it works! I honestly had my doubts because I had never used one before and because I bought the cheaper lol \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; brand but it actually works perfectly! It came right on time, plus the little black pouch totally disguises it! The only negative is that it does hurt a little bit, but Beauty is Pain!!</li>
    <li> I originally bought the REM Spring Sprong, but I had to order a new one after it was lost. This one is actually good quality, and comes with a better velvet pouch the the Spring Sprong and it&#x27;s 1/3 the price. It DOES hurt, but it is worth it for how long the results last and how quickly it works. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for this product for some time now. It is exactly the same as i had before. Thank you very much. Love it.</li>
    <li> I actually found out about this on Youtube; a girl did a review on it and it looked like a decent product. Kinda weird looking, but decent. And was very inexpensive so I wasn&#x27;t really worried about wasting money if it turned out to be a worthless piece of crap. But it&#x27;s worth every penny.     It is very simple to use, small enough to store anywhere and the black pouch is nice too (though I wouldn&#x27;t be upset if it came without it). The MySpring It is somewhat painful, but what do you expect? I doubt there is a pain- free way to rip hairs out of your face. It&#x27;s also much quicker than plucking out every hair one at a time. Another plus is that it barely causes redness.. and I have very tender, pale skin. And any redness that did occur went away in a couple minutes.     If you want to get rid of facial hair, I would go with this.    BTW.. If you are at all interested in amazing hair and make up tutorials, check out this Youtuber&#x27;s profile. &#x27;Loepsie&#x27; is her account name.</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give it a try because the cost was so low, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.   It didn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
    <li> I REQEUSTED SOME VODKA WITH MINES SO MY HUBBY WENT OUT TO GET SOME. IT STILL HURTED BUT NEXT TIME I WILL HAVE THE VODKA AND SOME NUMBING OINMENT.</li>
    <li> Post menopausal beard starting along with fine peach furring drove me to purchase this item.  I mastered the technique pretty quickly (fold it into a u shape and twirl) and yes, it did prickle, but wasn&#x27;t unbearable.  It took me more than once to achieve the hairlessness I sought, however, as the days passed, I realized that much of the hair that was removed was simply snapped off giving much the same result as a razor would give me, except that it isn&#x27;t removing fine fuzz.  So, my review is mixed.  I have to give it a thumbs up for good price, but I am not 100% happy for the reasons listed above. I expected the hair to be pulled out, not broken off - maybe my error.  I do continue to use it daily and I keep it on my desk.  No body seems to know what it is and I don&#x27;t have to sit in front of a mirror to use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the price.  Used the 19.98 one a friend had first - this one works just as good!</li>
    <li> It works, on peach fuzz, but doesn&#x27;t work on shorter hairs. I mainly purchased this for my upper lip, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wax or pluck, but it just doesn&#x27;t grab a hold to shorter hairs.</li>
    <li> I bought this item a couple of years ago and it worked really well.  I recently purchased a epilator and it was pure agony.  I used it on my face it actually tore up my skin.  I&#x27;m just now healed.  So, this little item works just as good, it&#x27;s cheaper and it doesn&#x27;t cause severe pain and wounds.  It is perfect for the face area.  I think it would take to long to use on the legs etc.... but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  I hope this review helps in your decision.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Saves me time from when I used just a tweezer. And no more sticky mess with wax. Once you get into the technique of twisting the handles, its easy, and quick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product twice a week for about a year. It really works. I personally think it&#x27;s way better than having your face waxed. Once you learned how to use it correctly, it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
    <li> For those of you familiar with the Bellable, this is not a Bellable- but it&#x27;s close.  It&#x27;s thicker than the Bellable and shorter, I had a handle come off on the first use- but super glued it back on.  It&#x27;s made in China and comes packages on Chinese dollar-store packaging.. i thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be as good.  It is sufficient and I am a women with POCS who NEEDS to use these.      As far as the technique... if you pluck hairs at all, it&#x27;s like plucking a group of hairs at once.  You get used to it fast and it is SOOOOOO worth it...</li>
    <li> Well first I bought this item on ebay for 2 bucks, and it didn&#x27;t come with the pouch (probably why it was cheaper)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, just as it is with every manual device, it&#x27;s about technique. I&#x27;ll try to explain it, but if I don&#x27;t explain it well just go on Youtube and hopefully there&#x27;s a helpful video. Lots of beauty gurus and whatnot there who have used this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you are holding it, hold it in a UPSIDE DOWN \\&quot;U\\&quot; shape or even a LITTLE wider. Turn it OUTWARDS (clockwise... noon to 6? lol) then move it up, then turn it inwards and go DOWNWARDS. It takes some time but if you do it correctly, your hair should be caught in the springs and you will pull it out from the root.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my upper lip (which surprisingly didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would... that area is very sensitive to me), my chin and cheeks, and a little near the side burn area. If you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s really addicting. It didn&#x27;t hurt anywhere which I am shocked at. You can feel the hair pulling but it isn&#x27;t as painful as threading or waxing. I&#x27;ve threaded (the art of threading, not this item) my own facial hair before and the spring is more faster because you get multiple hairs caught in one pull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY IMPORTANT BEFORE DOING THIS : Well, when I&#x27;d thread I&#x27;d wash my face but I&#x27;d still get bumps which have me stopped threading, I wasn&#x27;t sure if the thread had some sort of dirt on it and it would get into my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to have this happen with the spring, so what I did was clean the spring with RUBBING ALCOHOL. I put some in bowl, but the spring in, had it a little opened and closed, making sure the alcohol got IN the springs (where you&#x27;ll be doing your work) then WASH IT OFF WITH WATER. Make sure it&#x27;s clean. When it comes to your face, wash it thoroughly (or exfoliate, whichever you prefer or do), then USE A TONER (it can be alcohol or non-alcohol, as long as it cleans your face). After you use it, wash again. This will have your face CLEAN and the spring will also be clean. This will not give you bumps. Redness maybe inevitable, but have a calming lotion or a moisturizer, something that will heal after your facial hair removal (shea butter maybe, anything HEALING).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also don&#x27;t lick your face or anything, I know it sounds silly, but the bacteria will only irritate and possibly make the area black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep cleaning the device, and cleaning your face. It&#x27;s important no dirt gets in your pores and creates bumps. Also get as close as possible because this does pull the hair out from the roots, which is what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spring I think is strong, but the handles are plastic. Just take cares of it, keep cleaning, etc. Even if it breaks it&#x27;s just another 2 bucks. This beats waxing and going to the salon all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE Jan. 7th : I still have mine, it&#x27;s in good condition. I use it when I want a quick grooming because I forget to do it (winter break). But this thing is WONDERFUL. And it does take hair out of the root. The area becomes more smoother and it&#x27;s noticeable that it&#x27;s gone if you are one of those who have darker facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, TECHNIQUE!! THIS DOES WORK!! It&#x27;s like tweezing but it&#x27;s a spring. I also got use to the pain, this thing is nothing now. And I don&#x27;t have to pluck or wax. Just have the upside down U shaped spring go up and down, twisting and WALLA!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 5/25/12 - this works wonders, I got use to the pain on the top of my upper lip. I can do this with such ease now. The hair comes out of the root, I can hear the hair coming out. TECHNIQUE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I used to not be able to look people in the eye because of my mustache. I&#x27;m a girl and that&#x27;s embarrassing. Luckily i came upon this product. This removes all the hairs quick, easy, and virtually painlessly. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean. Also don&#x27;t need a mirror to do it! I do it while watching t.v. Warning: Don&#x27;t try to use on eyebrows, because you may pluck precious hairs. Also be sure to replace every 3 months or so. Overall great product, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> So I bought this after seeing the spring sprong, I didn&#x27;t want to fork over twenty bucks so when I saw this for 4 bucks I figured what did I have to lose? Well I got it today and used it and I love it! Way better than waxing. Of course it still hurts a little, but pretty much any time you&#x27;re pulling out hair it&#x27;s gonna hurt! But after using it I didn&#x27;t have any redness or irriation like I usually get from waxing and my skin looks smooth and the hair is all gone from my upper lip. Some people have had problems with using it, but I just bent it into the u shape, slid it up on the hair and then I let it go straight and then rolled up away from the direction of the hair growth and it worked pretty easy for me. Didn&#x27;t take much time at all to do my whole upper lip and it didn&#x27;t feel like torture like waxing does. I think it&#x27;s probably just as good as the spring sprong so I say buy it!</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is definitely not painless, and not a good alternative to waxing if you can&#x27;t stand the pain, since you really can feel each hair being pulled out one by one. But, unlike waxing, there is very little redness after use, and even that fades after just a few minutes. It&#x27;s much better than tweezing because more than one hair can be pulled at a time. I can only stand a few minutes at a time, though, because it is pretty painful. I may try icing the area before to see if it helps.  It takes a little getting used to. It took me a few minutes to get it to pull any hairs at all. After I tried it a few times, I got the hang of it and now it&#x27;s really simple. The only place I have some trouble is on my lip line. The rest of the upper lip is fine, though.</li>
    <li> Well I must say I am not happy with this product. The spring it&#x27;s handles are very flimsy and I&#x27;m afraid to use use it frequently because it is so cheap. At least i got the little pouch the advertisement stated it would come with.</li>
    <li> I bought this (with some trepidation) for my wife but she loves it and is delighted with the results. Great little buy!</li>
    <li> Ok, so sticking true to my goal of chemical free and low-cost or free living, here is one of my fav beauty tools in my bag. After reading dozens and dozens of reviews, I put it on my Amazon wish list and received it for Christmas in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in this product because I hate tweezing, I&#x27;ve been lasered (NOT permanent as claimed, but does last a few months), electrolysis is too $$$ and painful, and, though I have my own hot waxing system, I have a very difficult time removing the fine hairs right under my nose and on my chin - wax irritates me and causes break-outs in those areas as does depilatory cream. I was willing to risk someone else&#x27;s $5.00 on this. Did I mention it comes with its own velvet pouch?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took some getting used to, but after about four uses, I think I now qualify as a professional user of the Facial Hair Remover Threading Beauty Tool with FREE Black Velvet Pouch. Here is the link if you are interested in this cool little product:  http://www.amazon.com/Facial-Remover-Threading-Beauty-Velvet/dp/B001R8YUK0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1327580100&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My now-expert advice? Bend it (not quite in half), set it against the skin and twirl the spring at least two or three rotations in one spot, first one way, then the other, for maximum hair removal. Gently pull the spring apart (I do not use the handles for this part - too afraid they&#x27;ll break off) and blow the hairs out. It will seem awkward at first to use this, but it won&#x27;t be long before you, too, are singing this little device&#x27;s praises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using, I swipe on witch hazel (which is the best and cheapest astringent you can buy at about 70 cents a bottle) until the cotton round is clean. No oil is left on your skin and witch hazel is soothing so no break-outs. Have fun! Or at least as much fun as one can have ripping one&#x27;s hair out by the roots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, I love being a girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update August 2012: I&#x27;ve been using this great little device about twice a week since I got it for Christmas in 2011. I always blow the hairs out and rub it with a dry, lint-free cloth before putting it away and it looks as good as the day I opened it. I do not use this anywhere near my eyes, but for the removal of the rest of facial hair, it just cannot be beat. The more you use it, the less it hurts as the hair is shorter. Pain is worse when the hair is longer. With regular use, the hair will never be long enough for anyone to see. Also, I never use a mirror as I use this. I go by feel, and I might have one hair to tweeze each week - no joke. Love this thing, and still using my super cheap witch hazel to soothe my skin afterward.ittle device about twice a week since I got it for Christmas in 2011.

    <li> I gave this product a 4 because it did a pretty good job. My upper lip felt waxed after use. It isn&#x27;t completely dummy proof however, you do need to mess around untill you feel it pulling hairs. It is painful but so what beauty hurts!  I think you could find it for cheaper on ebay. I prefer Amazon for almost all my shopping though.</li>
    <li> I was very excited for this product and as soon as I tried it, I was disappointed. This product did not work for me. Maybe I was using it incorrectly, but all it did was snug at the hairs and did not pull anything out. I gave it the benefit of doubt and have tried it numerous time since purchasing it, and I am still unhappy with the results. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I was not sure if the product will work for me, so i decided to buy a cheaper version. Well, it works! Do not expect it to remove all of your hair. I have thin light hair, had to go over the same area multiple times in different directions, it worked well on upper lip and chin, cheeks were more problematic, I ended up leaving them alone after about 5 attempts on each side (it does hurt!) but it&#x27;s fine with me. I did use a magnifying mirror. I liked it more than waxing.</li>
    <li> It worked on my upper lip but I couldn&#x27;t get it to work anywhere else.  I wish they had better instructions on how to use.  The packaging is in Chinese so I am not sure what it says.  I find it flimsy but it&#x27;s the first one I have tried. Not bad, not great.  Wish it was short so easier to handle.  I have to hold closer to the middle on the coil part just to get better control.  The smell of the rubber is annoying.</li>
    <li> I had never used one of these tools before, it looks sort of like a torture device and feels similar to using a tweezer, but it&#x27;s faster because it pulls out many hairs at once. My skin was a little red immediately after use, but that subsided quickly.     However, my problem is a couple days post use, as the hairs are starting to come back in, my skin is irritated with what looks like teeny tiny whiteheads. The reason I stopped going to salons for hair removal was because of my tendency to get ingrown hairs from it. I thought this could work as a substitute, but apparently I&#x27;ll have to keep looking for something else.    For the record, mine did come with the black pouch (but it&#x27;s not nice or valuable or anything.) The plastic pieces could be more tightly attached ... it seems like that would make it easier and faster to use, but for the price, the item is okay.</li>
    <li> I have had great experience with  R.E.M Spring Sprong and wanted to order another one to carry in my purse. I was about to order when this (Facial hair remover...whatever long name it has) one showed up on the window and I fall for the price I guess (should have paid the extra 10 bucks and got my R.E.M). It was a mistake. The product is ok, nothing compare to R.E.M sprong. More gaps between the springs which makes shorter hair impossible to pluck, the ends are big and wobbly, have to use multiple times in the same spot to get hair out, ofcourse no luck with shorter hair, and overall just looks like a cheap device. If I had not used the Sprong, I probably would be ok with it, but knowing that there is something better to aid in this tedious task, I can&#x27;t be happy with this one. I will keep it as a backup or so and order another R.E.M Sprong to carry in my purse.</li>
    <li> The handles on the ends of the spring literally broke as soon as I touched it.   I tried to use it without the handles but it it didn&#x27;t capture any hair - tried it many different ways. FAILED attempt. Pay few more dollars and get a REAL one.</li>
    <li> This little threader works well for removing fine facial hair on my upper lip.  I would have given it five stars if it removed the few coarser hairs, but a quick tweeze takes care of those.  It only took a minute or two to get the hang of how to twist it.  I highly recommend it and will be buying another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time and it&#x27;s much easier and faster than plucking hair with tweezers. I would definitely recommend for mustache area.  It does not work on legs.  It hurts at first, but then you can just do a little bit each day or couple of days, and it&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.  If mine ever breaks or if I lose it, I will buy a new one.</li>
    <li> After reading all the reviews- good and bad I decided to give it a try since it was inexpensive. Sadly, it did not work for me. It did not pick a single hair from my sideburns which are long and thin. It pulled the hair (painful)but very little hair came off. For the lip area where my hair is short,nothing came out. I spend a long time trying different angles on how to hold it,and I washed my face thinking it would open my pores but nothing worked. Right now I have no idea where it is. Maybe I throw it away. Hight expectations, very low results.</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to threading because it&#x27;s small, convenient and easy to work with. It might take a little time to get use to using this, but it definitely works (and hurts, too, if you&#x27;re not use to threading).</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd one bought and gave it as a gift b/c the one i bough me is AMAZING!!!</li>
    <li> This is a painful product but after a few minutes you get use to it. I could feel and see the hairs being pulled however I did not see a difference in my skin when I was done. The hair was still visible. As if all it did was pull it and not pull it out. I will not purchase again because it is just too much work. Tweezers cut the time in half.</li>
    <li> Never thought that this product would be so good and now I regret that why I did not buy this earlier. This is very easy to use, painless and it does its job wonderfully. Its far better than waxing and creme use....believe me as I have tried almost everything for my upper-lips. This product is no-mess and you can use it anywhere without any hassle...wish one could get such a thing for my eyebrows.....Best, ouchless, and effective....</li>
    <li> I was able to remove my facial hair in LESS THAN 5 MINUTES. And for $4, you can&#x27;t beat it! No more worrying about being a girl and having a five o&#x27;clock shadow. GET IT NOW!</li>
    <li> Hair grows right back like anything else. Might as well shave, it&#x27;s less painful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had better versions of this at about the same price. But this one proved that you get what you pay for. The ability of this to remove small hairs is laughable, it does do a great job at just pinching skin though. I&#x27;d say get a different, slightly more expensive version or one that has some good reviews as the one by remi does well.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this! Yes, it does hurt, but of course it&#x27;s going to hurt - you&#x27;re ripping hair out of your face! Seriously though, the pain is bearable and I experienced no irritation afterwards. It was quick, easy, and worked even better than I expected. Especially for the price. You can&#x27;t beat this if you need to get rid of some pesky facial hair. I&#x27;ll be a lifetime user, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> This product works great.  My product came with the black carry pouch, although it&#x27;s not in the plastic package with the item, so I can understand how some people may have thought they didn&#x27;t get it. Dig through your mail package, it&#x27;s most likely caught up in the shipping material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me a few minutes as a newbie playing around to go from \\&quot;breaking\\&quot; the hair to actually \\&quot;removing\\&quot; it.&lt;br /&gt;I found it best to place the force on the lower tight area of the spring, apply pressure and slowly move up against the hair grain as I twisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way.  OUCH.  Works great but painful!!  Does a super job once you figure it out.  Stick with it and you will be hair clear in no time.  Tweezers still seem to be required for any short black stubbies though.</li>
    <li> Does get hair off my face and chin but doesn&#x27;t get it all.  I have a time with it to get hair under the chin and as I said won&#x27;t get all my hair out when I try to do all the hair.</li>
    <li> I have way more facial hair than any woman should and this works for me. Ive tried waxing and bleaching and this works the best for me. It does not irritate your skin at all so you can do it as often as needed. I do it while watching TV so I dont even really have to take time out of my day for it. The only down side is if you face isnt completely clean it tends to break it out. I solve this by doing it as soon as I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I got this product based on information I found on easier hair removal for my face. It&#x27;s painful at first, but well worth sticking with it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week or two now. I&#x27;ve tried plucking and chemical treatments, which don&#x27;t seem to give me half the results this does. This is my first try with a device like this, so I&#x27;m not sure about the differences between the cheap versions and the name-brand versions, but so far this one has worked quite well for the price!</li>
    <li> didnt work. just pulled on the hair and didn&#x27;t remove a dang thing</li>
    <li> i lovee this its so convenient and you can take it everywhere!   im not gunna lie it was painful at first very but you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t own any expensive one but I don&#x27;t know what else you will need from this kind of product--it&#x27;s simple,fast,clean,chemical free,convenient,easy to store.....so it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this product on a whim and I&#x27;ve gotta say I actually don&#x27;t mind it at all. Super easy to use and pretty effective in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I didnt like it as much as the MySpringIt. It was just ok. It removed an ok amount of hair but it seemed like it didnt pick up as much hair.</li>
    <li> Its an OK product not great not terrible.  It really takes way too long and doesn&#x27;t leave area that smooth.</li>
    <li> I  had first tried the REM Spring Sprong and that worked really well for me. However I keep losing them and I thought I would try a less expensive version but I was concerned that it would not work, so I also bought another REM-- hey I&#x27;m going to lose it again anyway!   This tool is bigger and the coils are not as tightly wound.  It did not remove a single hair. spend the extra money and get something that works properly.</li>
    <li> I can barely feel it removing any hair at all. I have some fine peach hair on my upper lip and it does not remove the hair at all. This is just a cheap imitation. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> For something this cheap, and this simple, it&#x27;s a great product.  I have more than one so I can keep one in my travel case.</li>
    <li> ES MUY FACIL D USAR, PRACTICO Y RAPIDOO, NO USAS NINGUN PRODUCTO EN LA PIEL Y KITA ASTA EL MAS PEQUENO BELLITO M ENCANTA.&lt;br /&gt; LO RECOMIENDO!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this one yet, but had one before and liked it.  Colors are good and it protected my table all winter.</li>
    <li> Super easy &amp; fast way to get rid of mustache hair. It does hurt a bit the first time using it, but if you keep up with it, it should hurt less and less. I love how simple this product is and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t involve a cream, harsh chemicals, etc. It&#x27;s just a simple device that removes hair. A+</li>
    <li> Seriously, this thing doesn&#x27;t pick up any hairs at all! Waste of money, and waste of time. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!</li>
    <li> works very well when you learn the trick</li>
    <li> I personally think that this is a waste of money and prefer to just let the ladies at the shop thread me because this tool did nothing for me; not sure if my hair is too fine or what but it did NOTHING!!!</li>
    <li> I had this product for a month and it started to rust even though I kept it in the case it came with!</li>
    <li> I love this...it can be painful at first- however once you use it a couple of times...easy peasy. You could by a more expensive one at Ulta- but it does the same thing.</li>
    <li> i love this thing. it hurts, of course, but it is the fastest and cheapest way to remove facial hair. BUT...after a while, your hands/ fingers start to cramp. whatever, still worth it, after all these years of trying everything else, i am satisfied with this thing</li>
    <li> I gave it the &amp;#34;try&amp;#34; ... again and again.  Did not matter what I did it would break the hair off more than pull out like it is supposed to do.  I had bought 2... planning to give one away.  I threw BOTH in the trash.</li>
    <li> Ehhh..nothing waxing can&#x27;t fix. Not worth the time or money. I am not interested in sitting there and toying with it.</li>
    <li> I have a peach fuzz, so you can imagine how tiny the hairs are. It is time consuming and painful. Eventually you get used to it after the first couple of hairs. Also, you should expect redness, but not a lot. The product overall is awesome and would recommend it to everyone. Plus it comes with a little case, how awesome is that?</li>
    <li> I own an Epicare and R.E.M. and thought I&#x27;d try this one because it is so much cheaper in price. It works great! It&#x27;s a bit shorter than the R.E.M. and because of that it handles better for me. I love this product. I use it in the restrooms in between my classes when I am short of time. I have sensitive skin, but the reddness disappears after about 5 minutes. It does hurt at first, but then it is so much better than tweezing one hair at a time, or spending the time messing with waxing.</li>
    <li> I bought THIS lttle item &amp; am HUGELY disappointed in it!! I have pretty fine hair but still expected it to remove the little bit I&#x27;ve just started to get above &amp; below my lips and it doesn&#x27;t remove a single thing!!!! It certainly doesn&#x27;t hurt since it really doesn&#x27;t do a thing for me-!! I hope you have much better results with yours...if you buy one-!!!! Good Luck-!!!!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I really wouldn&#x27;t have given it any \\&quot;stars\\&quot; but you have to in order to write a review about it &amp; I actually put off even giving it a review because I hated to give such a negative one, but I&#x27;ve tried to use it over &amp; over again to no avail-!!!!</li>
    <li> Unlike the previous reviewer, my facial hair is not so fine.  Myspring It does work wonders, though it is not pain-free.  I found a little topical anesthetic (such as baby oragel) works to minimize the sting.  It is much faster than tweezing, and lasts longer than shaving.</li>
    <li> Removes most of facial hair...hard to use at first but once I figured out how it was better</li>
    <li> This little beauty is great for fine or thin facial hairs, but it leaves a lot to be desired for short coarse chin hairs.  It does a great job around the lip and cheek areas, and it&#x27;s fun learning how to use it... Threading 101!  Overall, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> even after &amp;#34;mastering&amp;#34; it isnt worth the time or carpal tunnel to work it!</li>
    <li> Works well, and hurts a little bit.</li>
    <li> This beauty tool does work well but only take a little hair and pinches others.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> Could never get the hang of it...</li>
    <li> It works. I purchased this because it was cheap and I was tired of using tweezers on my chin hair one by one. I had hopes that this would do the threading faster and cleaner.  Well, this device works by catching the hairs in between the springs which makeup the device. Once you roll the ends of the device, the hair are pulled out from its root.   Now, if anyone tells you that it&#x27;s painless, they are lying to you. I will say that if you&#x27;ve been waxing or tweezing the hairs on your chin for a while, then it won&#x27;t hurt as much. Those with a little lip fuzz like myself will feel a sting. And since the spring threader pulls out a bunch of hairs at a time, its worse. I hardly ever do anything with the hairs on my upper lip so that may be why it hurts so much. I guess you could try a numbing cream before using it.   I like that I can watch tv and use it without a mirror.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great buy! I have tried many products but I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.  It&#x27;s an ugly color but that&#x27;s not as important.lol.  The other people who rated it very low were probably using it wrong.   Follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll get the results you want. It&#x27;s a great alternative  to hair removal but it is a little painful at the beginning.   I have dry sensitive skin but after adding a little moisturizer the redness went away quickly.  Make sure to clean it before every use! Gotta try it!</li>
    <li> I love this wand! It is saving me so much time and money! No more bleaching, no more waxing, plucking! I am so glad I added this to my order! I do think that the wand is a bit too flexible which might make it a bit harder to use. I also think that some of the hairs are being broken instead of plucked, but it&#x27;s okay, it doesn&#x27;t make the hair prickly or thinker. I can use it often enough to where I never have any hair. It came with the pouch, which is nice for storage.</li>
    <li> alright at first i didn&#x27;t know how to work this correctly, but after youtubeing, i was able to use this and be able to get some hair out... sometimes it cuts the hair b/c mine is very shirt and thin... but it does work... its not too pricey, so it should be okay to give it a try?</li>
    <li> Long and short of it is : it doesn&#x27;t work! Difficult and strenuous to use. It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hairs, just a little of it gets off and in an attempt to remove all, one suffers pains in the hands. So, I&#x27;m back to creams.</li>
    <li> Today my threader tool arrived in the mail, with the promised free black velvet pouch.  I should have waited a few days longer because when I ordered it here from Amazon, it was 95 cents, and today I see that it&#x27;s down to 78 cents.  Ah, well.  Anyway, the packaging is peppered with presumably Chinese characters and the back says it&#x27;s made in China, but in English on the front it also says \\&quot;Come from Japan\\&quot;.  For those of you who are curious, the tool itself seems to be called a &#x27;Dono Super Stick&#x27;.    Regardless, I have never used one of these tools before, having waxed (at home) and tweezed for years.  I liked the concept of something I could carry around with me and pull out as needed.  So I was very glad to find that this little threading tool is quite effective after I had figured out how to use it.  The whole \\&quot;make a U-shape\\&quot; thing absolutely does not work for me!  What I do instead is hold one end taut and then, with a very slight crescent-shape to the part of the spring closest to the other handle, I twist that handle slightly, and POOF!  Out come the hairs.  You have to run the spring around your face at different angles to get all the little hairs that grow in different directions.  It seems to work as well for fine hair as it does for coarse hair (snagged two eyebrow hairs by mistake!) and I&#x27;d say, for 78 cents (or even 95!) it&#x27;s not at all a bad tool for a girl to have in her arsenal of personal beauty supplies.</li>
    <li> Works well but it does hurt. I think it may just take some getting used to. Arrived promptly &amp; was a great price compared to others just like it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for something that only costs about 78 cents plus shipping.  But, I was pleasantly surprised because it works great!  I&#x27;ve never used something like this before.  I do have an epliator that I use to remove my leg hairs, and so I am used to the uncomfortableness that involves plucking multiple hairs all at once.  But, it doesn&#x27;t do facial hair and I was tired of plucking individual hairs with tweezers.  I got this during my lunch break at work, and a couple of work mates and I played around with it (it removes arm hair very easily we found out :)). I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home to try it out.  My husband laughed at me because I was so ecstatic about pulling out my \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; hair.  He came back 20 minutes later and was surprised I was still removing hair with it.  Once you start, you just can&#x27;t stop from finding any unsightly hair that needs to be removed.  This device is genius!  One word of caution- if you find it&#x27;s not pulling any hair, make sure you are twisting it the right way.  I kept wanting to twist it the opposite way, but it doesn&#x27;t work that way.  Make sure you are rolling out with your fingers, not in.  Hope that makes sense.  Anyways, happy plucking!  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t fork out $20 bucks for a name brand threader because this one was a steal!</li>
    <li> So... I ordered this with no high expectations at first. I was thinking that the product delivery would be delayed and it would come very late, and that this would not work.    I was wrong. It came in a week after I ordered it... And it WORKS! I was just amazed... And it was ALMOST painfree! The only con was that it smells of rusty metal (but I can endure). I was AMAZED. And for a cheap price! NO MORE SHAVING!</li>
    <li> I love this hair removing tool! It works so good and it leaves my skin hair free and feeling soft. It does hurt a little it but if you keep up with it week after week than you get used to it.</li>
    <li> Very tricky to use.  No instructions.  Felt like I wasted my money.</li>
    <li> it came in a nice soft sleeve and was package well. it looks just like the photo as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe i wasn&#x27;t using it right, but i sure felt and thought i did. just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;but everyone is diff. might work for you.</li>
    <li> Works very well, but sets off my sneeze reflex when I use it on upper lip area. It&#x27;s a great product if you are frugal like me. Wish it came in a plastic storage tube instead of fabric pouch.</li>
    <li> Two Things:  1. This was a Great Investmen, it actually works! And you don&#x27;t have to use it too often, because it really pulls the hairs out. Personally I like it better than waxing, bleaching, or threading. (I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, though the little that I do have this works).  &amp;  2. I purchased this product before that I liked it so much I wanted to buy two more as gifts. Though I was a little irritated about not recieving the black pouches with the last two I purchased. I mean if something says what it&#x27;s coming with &amp; I&#x27;m paying for it, I&#x27;d expect it to come with what it says.</li>
    <li> For the price, it is very good one. Saves a lot of time and money. But you need to use it more often, do not let your heir grow too long, else it will heart. You can use it every week and works fine on long heir growth. it hurts on long heir growth.</li>
    <li> This thing is truly amazing. I have a battery operated \\&quot;hair puller\\&quot;, but it only grabs one or two hairs at a time, and of course, it eats batteries. This simple spring tool removes many hairs with a single swipe and never needs recharging. I actually have three of them now. I keep one at home, one in the car and one at the office. Often, when I&#x27;m waiting at a stop light I&#x27;ll pull it out and roll it over my chin a couple of times to pick up any stray hairs I may have missed when I last used it. I really like the ease of use and not having to worry about it breaking.</li>
    <li> I originally sold these on commission with another company that \\&quot;claimed\\&quot; to have originated the design and creation.  For the past 2 years now I&#x27;ve been using my demonstrator model on a regular basis to remove peach fuzz, lip hair, &amp; chin/neckline hair with great effect.    Then I began to have continual breakouts, but couldn&#x27;t figure out what from.  Upon further examination, I realized that dead skin cells and hair had clogged up the interior of my spring from continual use without cleaning.  (It&#x27;s VERY hard to clean these!)  Grossed out, I threw away my old model and figured I was going to have to pay $14 with my former company for a replacement.  On a whim, I began to search on Amazon for a similar product, when I found that the item was being sold at wholesale prices.  I quickly found this model, bought it, and eagerly anticipated it&#x27;s arrival.  When I got it, I found it looked and worked EXACTLY like it&#x27;s $14 cousin, but cost a fraction of the price.    I figure for the $2 it cost for this one, if it gets disgusting in a few months, it won&#x27;t matter as I can just pitch that one out, and get another one!</li>
    <li> The first time I bought a spring hair remover I purchased the REM spring - which is an amazing one, I decided to go with this one, because if I could get the same results and spend half, I thought that would be a good way to go. If THIS had been the first spring tool I had purchased, I would have given up on it within the first few months. The handles are attached awkwardly and are HUGE, it makes it hard to maneuver the spring the way you would need to, and it&#x27;s too long, you can&#x27;t get enough leverage to get the spring to do any real work. The spring doesn&#x27;t grab nearly as many hairs as my REM spring. Something about the metal that is used to make this- it&#x27;s not as flexible, you really have to work to get it to grab any hairs, and even then- it leaves the smaller ones behind. In order to use it with any success, you almost have to forgo the handles altogether and place your fingers on the spring towards the center to make it work .  If you are thinking about trying a spring tool, I would go with another brand - in this case it does make a difference. I&#x27;ve only tried the REM tool, but I hear good things about Bellabe and epicare as well. I would stay away from this one, as it only removes a fraction of the hair the other tools can.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hair remover that actually works, don&#x27;t buy this. I tried this on my peach fuzz and it hardly does anything besides sting a little. Unless you&#x27;re trying to rip out your eyebrows, this won&#x27;t do anything for you. I would recommend wax strips, or looking into a more expensive but better reviewed threading tool.</li>
    <li> I really like it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> Since i lost my previous one i order a new one. It does its work perfectly. takes a lil bit practice, once u learn , its the easiest , most effective and quickest way to get rid of those unwanted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first time when i ordered, i got a velvet pouch- which is nice to have, keeps it covered. But second order didnt come with its pouch :( :( , apart from that, its perfect!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not as simple to use as you think. once you get the hang of it, it works. hard to get side burns and doesn&#x27;t work for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> This product was awful, very painful and left marks on my skin.  I wish I had never bought it.  I don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after searching amazon for hair remover products. Since waxing can be a chore, and this little tool is completely self-contained, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I found that it worked great for the hair on my upper lip, as I had great control of it in that area and it would remove all the hair cleanly. On my neck and chin, however, I found that it took much more effort to get it to work just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like about this particular tool is that I could take it anywhere and I could use it even without a mirror (on my lip, of course...I didn&#x27;t feel like I could develop enough control of it to use it on my eyebrows, with or without a mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things I didn&#x27;t like about it were that it wasn&#x27;t precise. Sometimes, I could feel and see that there was just one hair that I needed to get, and no matter what I did, this tool wouldn&#x27;t pick it up, so ended up using tweezers. Also, while I didn&#x27;t have any problem with the distance between coils, I did kind of get grossed out after I realized that the hair I was removing was all getting caught up in the center of this tool. There really, is no way of cleaning or sterilizing it. When I did try to run it under water to get the hair out of the center, it ended up rusting, and I had to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool is inexpensive enough, but I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll bother replacing it. Waxing is a chore, but with pre-waxed strips, I think I might save myself a lot of time and hassle in the future.</li>
    <li> Product does remove some hair but is not very efficient at removing a lot of hair. I can remove more hair by tweezing than I can by using this</li>
    <li> I use these daily.  It works</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like this. Felt that it was hard to use and it really pinched. I would rather self-wax! Seriously.  Maybe I just didn&#x27;t have the technique down right or something, but it just was not for me, personally.</li>
    <li> I can not figure it out</li>
    <li> I was looking for a solution for the hair on my upper lip- I hated going to the salon to get it waxed because it&#x27;s expensive and strangely, it srarts growing back after only a couple of days, so I didn&#x27;t want to try it at home either. I had been using a depilatory, but it didn&#x27;t do a very good job and also only lasted a few days. I decided to try one of these, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $20 on a little threader tool. So I went with this cheaper version.    It does pluck the hair. It misses very short hairs, but that doesn&#x27;t really matter to me as much as the longer more noticeable hairs. You have to practice with it a little bit to figure out how to use it. I should also note that I had previously tried just plucking the hair with regular tweezers and it was extremely painful and I couldn&#x27;t do it. With this tool though, it was only painful a couple of times but was not that bad. I can&#x27;t compare it to the more expensive brands, but I am happy with it. It gives me an easy and cheap way to take care of unwanted facial hair (it&#x27;s such a small area, it seems silly to spend so much money on waxing and stuff like that).</li>
    <li> This little gadget is nothing more than glorified tweezers. It pinches and pulls AND doesn&#x27;t remove fine hair. It does remove some hair but no better than tweezers. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star is that it&#x27;s good for travel. It&#x27;s also faster than tweezing, if you don&#x27;t mind your discomfort all at once. It isn&#x27;t worth much. So, I&#x27;d only recommend buying it at a VERY LOW price.</li>
    <li> Bought it after much research online, but since it&#x27;s a brand new idea, at least to me, I decided it I didn&#x27;t want to pay more than $5 (including shipping) to experiment with a spring.&lt;br /&gt;All my upper lip hair is gone, it&#x27;s basically threading with a spring instead of using threads. Pretty ingenious. I like it a lot but have to see if I am able to use this for long periods of time in the lower facial area. It does hurt while it pulls, but it&#x27;s not as painful as I thought it would be, and not as painful as some people described in their reviews. I guess it also has a lot to do with how thick or stubborn your facial hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- takes a while to get all the hair, doesn&#x27;t get them all in one go. Time consuming (but not too bad. It also might be because I don&#x27;t have the grip and twist motion perfected)&lt;br /&gt;- Hard to work my lower chin area and the sides by the jaw with it. If there is a precise technique just for those areas, I&#x27;d like to learn about that.&lt;br /&gt;- not ideal for brows in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great buy for the price I paid. I will recommend it to others to give it a try. Not sure about long term use yet but hopefully it will work.</li>
    <li> The end handle, knob, or whatever you want to call it fell off after using the first time for just minutes. Not thinking about it, I threw away  the packaging so I cant even return it.. Not happy at all with this! Waste of money!</li>
    <li> I no longer look like Sasquatch! I LOVE this little tool. It took a few times to get the hang of the procedure, but then WOW! My chin and upper lip have never been smoother. I&#x27;ve told everyone I know about it. Yes, it does hurt, but pulling out hair hurts! I TOTALLY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I tried it out because it was cheaper than others. I found that it works best on long upper lip hair... it gets the job okayish. sometimes if the hairs are short it wont pull it out. I dont know how to clean this product it didnt say in the instructions so i just rinse it with water and alchohol because hairs get stuck inside the coil. it hasnt rusted yet so yeah. I would say its decent but if you want to get rid of all your lip hair this will be extremely painful. Ive used it for my sideburns and works well but is painful as well:/</li>
    <li> My skin got absolutely crazy after I used it.  Maybe it was just me.  I don&#x27;t know.  It hurt me a lot.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work for me; it is tedious and painful.</li>
    <li> I liked this. I was able to thread the annoying side burns that I have and my chin &amp; cheeks. I only used it once bc my daughter got her hands on it and I haven&#x27;t seen it since. I am however ordering another one. I really liked it! It hurts a little-but no worse than threading at the salon.</li>
    <li> Cheaply made item. One of the handles on mine keeps coming off. But this thing kind of works. Quickly removes hair on my face but I have to use it a few times on the same area. It doesn&#x27;t pick up every hair though, but I can just tweeze the few leftover hairs. Also, this thing doesn&#x27;t work on very short hairs so you have to grow out your hair a bit. It&#x27;s also difficult to use it on some corners of your face such as the edge of your nose.</li>
    <li> I have used this once and like the result. It does hurt but as the saying goes you have to suffer to be beautiful right?? I have already recommended this to a friend</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m an idiot and didn&#x27;t use it correctly but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It grabs hair but does not remove them. I have very thin asian hair so I think that is the problem. My friend has one and it works for her but her hair is much thicker then mine. Don&#x27;t get if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is truly the best solution for hair removal. I have lip chin and cheeks yet am only 24!! I&#x27;ve hated tweezing everyday this thing is so much easier!! Still have to tweeze a few stubborn hairs but I have gave this to a few family members and they love it too. Didn&#x27;t think something so cheap and simple could work but it does! Yeah it hurts beauty is pain!! U get use to the feeling and it hurts less the more you use it!! Other reviews convinced me to take a chance and try it I&#x27;m happy I did n hope my review gives you the courage to try it. It cost almost the same aa a decent pair of tweezers or jar of wax so why not ********UPDATE...........MY WHOLE FACE IS NOW BROKEN OUT HORRIBLY HORRIBLY AFTER USING THIS:( IF YOU HAVE SEMI SENSITIVE SKIN I DON&#x27;T SUGGEST THIS. MY FACE HAS NEVER EVER EVER EVER IN MY LIFE LOOKED LIKE THIS)</li>
    <li> It pinches and seems to get light, fine hairs-- but misses the darker ones you&#x27;re trying to get.  I tried them-- then succumbed to the more expensive laser option, happily.</li>
    <li> I bought the REM one at first but then gave it to my grandma because she loved it.  I bought this one to replace it but it isn&#x27;t the same.  I dont know if it is the coils aren&#x27;t as tight but it doesn&#x27;t seem to pull the hair out as well. It won&#x27;t pull out half of them</li>
    <li> Painful and still didn&#x27;t work. Tweezers are better, cheaper, versatile, and convenient to purchase.</li>
    <li> This hardly works on thin facial hair and it&#x27;s very time taking troublesome to use. Much better off waxing or tweezing.</li>
    <li> It works just like the description. It hurts a bit, but no more than tweezing..... and way less than waxing!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a product that for sure works, BUT ladies we could have bought a mini thin metal spring at a hardware store for about $1; same thing with out the pink!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good product, but it hurts like :@:$)((; yea.</li>
    <li> it hurt to bad not worth it</li>
    <li> i just got this product in the mail 2 days ago and it is amazing!!! i have struggled with facial hair for about 12 years now and it is very course hair and most facial hair remover products dont work for me so i pluck. this can take so much time and i dont always have an hour to sit down and do that. this prduct was so easy to use first i watched a youtube video to watch how to use it and when i tried it it was soo easy. the product took out all the hairs that usually take me an hour to remove only took me about 15 min to get all of them. I highly recommend this to anyone who is struggling with unwanted facial hair.</li>
    <li> Threading is supposed to be so popular and such an effective way to remove facial hair that I just had to try this. I don&#x27;t get it.  After multiple attempts to master this device, I still found it lacking.  Oh sure, it removed one or two hairs at a time but I need more help than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take steroids because of kidney disease. One of the &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; side-effects of steroids is unwanted facial hair. I am always on the look-out for new hair removal products --- searching for one that really works.  This isn&#x27;t it.  I find that a bright light, a magnifying mirror and a good pair of tweezers is faster and more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, more money (instead of hair) down the drain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to use and it doesn&#x27;t have the container that was said to be included with the product. It&#x27;s a waste.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your time or money.  I wish I would have known that before I bought it!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, hurts less than threading or waxing, time consuming and needs some practice to get to used to use it. You tweezers for sure for some stubborn hair. Would I recommend this product to my friend? Yes, I would. But this is not replacement for salon expert...</li>
    <li> This product is the same as the ones that are $10-25. If you&#x27;re going to buy one, just get it from this seller. The HDE Facial Hair Remover came with a felt pouch, product was in tact, and perfect. I read in some reviews that it didn&#x27;t come in the pouch or it was broken. I&#x27;ve had mine for 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s still fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need tips on how to use it, look up tutorials on YouTube. Just look it up under the pricier hair remover names. Yes it will hurt but you&#x27;ll get used to it. Takes time to get a handle on it. I&#x27;m happy with this product and I definitely recommend it. The shipping was quick and all was fine.</li>
    <li> This thing actually works!  Took all of five seconds to figure it out.  Best six bucks I ever spent!  I love it.</li>
    <li> it does the job as I expected. the length could be slightly less though but it doesn&#x27;t matter now. still !</li>
    <li> It took a few tries to get going, but once I got the knack it made short work of my &#x27;moustache&#x27; of fine dark hairs. It was not very noticeable, but seems to be getter more abundant as I age. SO time to do something about it. Yes it hurts and I had to stop for a few seconds between every twirl, but it was not unbearable and I think I will get used to it. It pulled those fine hairs out by the roots and lasted for a good month before I started to notice regrowth. Some redness and tenderness for a short time after use, but that quickly went away after a few minutes. Great value compared to other options.</li>
    <li> It hurts! A lot. You don&#x27;t get used to it, and it takes forever to remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it because I get razor burn easy on my face. This thing, although it doesn&#x27;t leave razor burn, hurts. Now, to give you an idea, I can take pain. I get the worse tooth aches and rarely take pain pills for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if I wanted to put myself through the pain this thing causes, which is no where near a tooth ache, I wouldn&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t remove hair worth a damn.</li>
    <li> I like it for the easy threading, BUT, warning, after I tried it for the first time, very enthusiastically I might add, I broke out in cystic acne and I am almost 60 years old. I researched and found this is common, and it is recommended to use astringent etc.. I think I may try it again, sparingly.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other similar products and thought to start with a cheaper option.&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to be fairly ok.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried it only twice so far, but it seems to be good.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not good for the small hair or areas where holding the spring perpendicular is difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Probably I will get a hang of it once I use it more. As of now, its an ok tool.</li>
    <li> This is hard to use and doesn&#x27;t work well.  It would be more beneficial to use tweezers.  Wouldn&#x27;t waste my cash!</li>
    <li> I found plucking too time consuming and chemicals too harsh so I did some research and found this thing so I tried it. After I figured out how to use it I decided it works ok but I still have to use tweezers for some hairs. It&#x27;s not the perfect tool some made out to be but it does make the job a little quicker and you do get used to it after awhile.</li>
    <li> No more mustache! I have bleached for years, and a blonde mustache is still a mustache. This product removed all the hairs, and I love it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong--it hurts to pull out the hairs, but after having burned my face with too strong of bleach and irritated my skin with waxes and glue strips, this is THE thing I will be using from now on. A couple of pieces of advice on how to use this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash your face first, because it will not work as well on oily skin/hair.&lt;br /&gt;2. The motion you use is to twist your hands together inward, like you are twirling a mustache up.&lt;br /&gt;3. I find it less painful to do small patches: one little twist, then one little twist, sometimes moving from place to place to avoid making one spot sore.&lt;br /&gt;4. When I am done, I cleanse the area and do not moisturize--I find that I break out if I put oily products on my open pores. I finishing rising with cool water to close them and help with discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;5. The discomfort/tingling goes away much quicker if you move your face around after, Make funny faces, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this thing, and rejoiced the day I threw away my bleach. Yay!</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing! You just roll it on your face or anywhere and it definitely pulls out any unwanted hair so easily and the price just can&#x27;t be beat. These things were going for WAY too much money on home shopping and I would buy this from this vendor again. It came in a nice, little, fabric, black bag and works amazingly well.</li>
    <li> I like to sit on the couch and get really creepy with this.  My fiance hates that I do it while watching tv, but it&#x27;s so easy to just use while not looking.  Although, it&#x27;s not precise enough to sit in the mirror and get the &amp;#34;one hair&amp;#34; that needs plucking...you will still need tweezers for that bad boy.  It&#x27;s AMAZING and SHOCKING to see how much hair/fuzz it finds.  I have recommended it already to a bunch of friends.  I just wonder if you have to buy this one or if other one from China that&#x27;s only $1 or $0.05 is really basically the same thing.  It&#x27;s not a rocket science tool.  It&#x27;s just a spring with handles.</li>
    <li> This pretty pink tool works wonders, it really gets all the hair, even the hard to reach. I recommend this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANKS~</li>
    <li> Works but hurts! ouch!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had this for several months and was waiting to have some time with it before reviewing. there is a slight learning curve with this tool to get a smooth finish. i&#x27;ve been using it for my upper lip. yes, i have to go over it several times before its hairless and smooth, but i kinda do it while watching a movie at home. it&#x27;s mindless work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used it for my cheek/sideburn area once, and broke out badly. NOT to scare anyone because i had it done at a salon once and broke out badly also. i think it&#x27;s just my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall: great product. it came WITH the velvet pouch. it&#x27;s not painLESS or painFREE, but i like being able to do it at home, for free, with only relative discomfort.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> It works, but it does hurt. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> It works, on peach fuzz, but doesn&#x27;t work on shorter hairs. I mainly purchased this for my upper lip, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wax or pluck, but it just doesn&#x27;t grab a hold to shorter hairs. And I am NOT going to grow out my upper lip hair, gross.</li>
    <li> Good for the first time but not working once used on the skin applied with cream. The oil/cream lubricated the wires and such just could not hold and pull hair any more.</li>
    <li> Yes, it definitely hurts to rip out hair no matter how you do it. But I found this to be less painful than waxing, less irritating to the skin, and so easy to use! Some angles are trickier than others, but in general it does the job if you follow the instructions. Whoever invented this is brilliant.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday.  And it is easy to keep up.  Once you&#x27;ve gotten thru the initial discomfort, the maintenance if done regularly is easy.  No burns or weird reactions from chemicals.  Simple is best after all.  I&#x27;ve worn out a couple of these but it took a very long time to do that.</li>
</ol>
