      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>The issue is, I used to be able to use it once per day or every 2-3 days before.</li>
      <li>It works OK on my back, but you must use it 1-2 times per day and it works best if you leave it  on for a couple of minutes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have tried so many other products. This one works the best. It keeps my skin pretty clear.</li>
    <li> The original formula was great when I had really bad acne (cystic) it was pretty tingly on my face but definitely not irritating. Then for awhile I switched face washes (I couldn&#x27;t find it in the store) and just a few weeks ago I  repurchased oxy (at this time my acne was not nearly as bad but still quiet a few small bumps nothing cystic).  On the container it says that it is new and improved and I didn&#x27;t think much of it but when I started using it I didn&#x27;t get good results, my skin was becoming very irritated and actually more bumpy then before I started using it. It is hard for me to say if it&#x27;s the new formula or the fact that my acne condition is mild. Long story short,if you have cystic acne or just large inflamed bumps I would suggest trying it but be cautious of irritation. If you have mild acne I would NOT suggest this because it is very strong!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this produce for years and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  Never lets me down.  What more can I say?</li>
    <li> even in my middle age, I still get acne and blackheads.  This stuff works great.  In fact so great, if you don&#x27;t completely rinse your face...I do mean completely... when you drive off, the benzoyl peroxide will bleach the towel slightly each time.</li>
    <li> I am 27 years old and I have been using this product for about two years now. Since I was 13 I&#x27;ve pretty much always had acne. But since using this product my skin is so much clearer and I only get a break out or two right before my period. I use it twice a day. When I use it in the shower I lather it onto my face and leave it on there like a mask for about 3-4 minutes. I had to work up to this over a couple weeks. I have used proactive for a while before and for how expensive it is, it does not work very well. Save your money and buy this product instead. I also use Nutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub with it. I use it every morning in the shower right before I use the Oxy acne wash. They work great together. Just a warning, it doesn&#x27;t matter how well you rince it off your face if you dry your face with a colored towel after use it will bleach it. It will also bleach the towel you put your hair up in. I highly suggest you save your pretty colored towels the agony of being bleached and simply use white towels.</li>
    <li> I tried different products and this one is the only one that works. I&#x27;m shaving my head and suffered from some acne spots (more or less severe over the time) for years. I didn&#x27;t know what to do and than I discovered this stuff. 1-2 weeks after starting with the pads the acne disappeared. The pads were a little bit annoying though, because the plastic can isn&#x27;t tight (bad for traveling) and I had to wear latex gloves, otherwise my fingers are drying out when touching the pads on a daily basis. [On a different note: You can switch to a bottle of salicylic acid pore cleanser and use paper towels or cotton pads]. I switched to the face wash then, and got the same great results. You have to use them daily though. I use them in the morning, and most important in the evening in the shower. If you have acne maybe as a result from greasy skin, this is definitely your product!</li>
    <li> Okay, I am Black woman over 40. And, I love this face wash. I suffered from pretty bad acne. I had been using ProActiv and decided to use Philosophy Purity. Yikes! My face developed horrible acne that ProActiv could not clear. I tried a number of different products before trying Oxy. And, man, does it work. My skin looks and feels wonderful. I use the complete Oxy line. I start with the scrub, then follow it up with the wash. I use the cleansing pads and spot treatment (which I actually apply to my full face). It keeps my face clear. And, if I get an occasional pimple, it is cleared very quickly. As compared to other acne treatments, Oxy is very inexpensive. I went ahead and started subscribing to the products so I would not run out.    WARNING: This is NOT for anyone with sensitive skin. This is very strong. Also, it can bleach clothing so be sure that you aren&#x27;t wearing your favorite clothing when you wash up!</li>
    <li> From about age 13 to 23, I regularly suffered from pretty bad acne outbreaks. I tried all sorts of medications to treat it, both prescribed and over the counter. I had become all but resigned to the idea that it would become a lifelong affliction. It was not until I discovered this stuff while in college that I had found a truly effective solution for my acne woes. I have been using it for about 4-5 years now and could not be happier. Save yourself some trips to the dermatologist and unhealthy antiobiotic prescriptions and give this a shot. The only downside to is that the active ingredient (benzoyle peroxide) is a bleaching agent. You&#x27;ve got to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t get on your clothes, carpet etc.</li>
    <li> This product cleared my skin in just a few days of twice daily use. Also, no new outbreaks have occurred since I began using Oxy Max. Prior to Oxy, I used a prescription wash with 4% benzoyle peroxide. This prescription did not work nearly as well as Oxy. A word of caution; Oxy will definately bleach towels, wash clothes or anything else that contacts it. A few drops of water and Oxy splashed onto a bathmat unnoticed until the next day when small, bleached spots appeared. Other than that, this is an amazing product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is getting harder to find at local stores.  Target doesn&#x27;t seem to carry it any more.  The items I received had an expiration date far enough in the future to guarantee I&#x27;d use all 4 long before they expired.  Price is good.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for clearing up skin, and is more effective at reducing redness and inflammation than salycylic acid based washes.  But look out, you don&#x27;t want to get this anywhere near clothing or towels because it will leave huge bleach stains! That means I can only use it when I shower and I always have to make sure to rinse off really well.</li>
    <li> I am a 16 boy who has gone through multiple cleansers, scrubs, washes, treatments, moisturizers, lotions, and tons of other useless PRICEY stuff that did nothing.  When I bought this face wash I switched to it totally, it provides the power of benzoyl peroxide (like in a lotion treatment) without having to leave it on your face.  Most boys aren&#x27;t very keen on putting lotions and powders on their face and I am no exception.  THIS WASH IS FANTASTIC and I recommend it to anyone.  This is my routine and my breakout has NEARLY completely cleared in a just a week so far.    Morning (In Shower):  Wet Face  Put wash in hands  Lather WELL (this is key in activating the benzoyl)  Gently MASSAGE for about 15 seconds  RINSE ONCE, That way some of the medication is left behind.  Try not to let any more water get on your face after this    DRY COMPLETELY on it&#x27;s own.    Apply Equate Daily Moisturizer Oil-Free. ( Great and light for boys, doesn&#x27;t shine or look like makeup.      FOLLOW EXACT SAME PROCEDURE IN THE EVENING  Stick with this for one week and your acne will clear up extremely fast.    I also shave nightly, which exfoliates my face. I recommend getting Aveeno Ultra Calming Shave Gel, use it before washing morning or night and then follow with procedure.</li>
    <li> Pros:Cheap, effective when used properly    Con(just one): I really wish this product was more soapy/lathering than it is. I have had other Benzoyl Peroxide face washes that were much more soapy and therefore easier to use.</li>
    <li> Oxy Maximum Daily Face Wash is an amazing product. I have honestly been using it now for over 7 years, back from when it had a slightly different name and different packaging. But truth be told, it has helped year after year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to understand about acne and acne medication is that different products work for different people. Salicylic acid I found, does almost diddly squat for me. But benzoyl peroxide does work! I suggest trying many different products to find the best fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you, 10% benzoyl peroxide is quite strong. It will make your face dry more than normal, especially if you live in a non-humid climate, like here in Colorado. I recommend using a quality non-pore clogging moisturizer afterwards to help with the drying. And don&#x27;t use it more than twice a day...I was using it 3-4 times a day for a while and it made my face compensate for dryness by producing lots of excess sebum...not fun to have that oily of a face all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are new to acne products, I would start with this one. Give it about 3 weeks and you&#x27;ll definitely notice a difference, and if it just isn&#x27;t working for you, try another product instead. Either way, I don&#x27;t think the majority will go wrong with Oxy Maximum Daily Face Wash. Great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the single one of these, it&#x27;s okay, the consistency is a little thin but it&#x27;s effective overall.    However, I ordered a pack of 4 and one bottle was completely empty upon arrival.  This is the 3rd package Amazon has messed up.  Just a heads up.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great and is at a great price for the 4-pack.  For best results apply the product to a back-scrubber and scrub your back.  Leave the suds on your back for as long as possible before rinsing.  I apply this product 1st then apply my Phisoderm bodywash (let that sit for as long as possible too). Then my face wash (same Oxy Maximum product), I let that sit as well while I&#x27;m doing the hair stuff (shampoo/conditioner).      Good luck!</li>
    <li> Excellent product and service</li>
    <li> I had little acne but my face was so oily and acne breakouts started to increase rapidly all over my face. then i used this product once a day a little amount. and it made my face clear again. but if it makes your face overly dry then try using it less. also it&#x27;s maximum they offer another product that is weaker i believe.</li>
    <li> For the past few months I have had a massive breakout that just did not want to clear up. I have always had a few pimples here and there especially around the time of the month. I started breaking out really badly four months ago and its horrifying. I do not mean a few small pimples, but islands of them on my forehead, chin, cheeks , jawline, just everywhere. I also had large pimples all over that hurt so badly. My self esteem was super low so I tried so many products. I tried nutrogena, olay, cetaphil(most of the drug store name brands), and products from the body shop. I got really desperate and bought murad which is expensive and made things worse and I used it for 3 weeks! My mom saw how badly it got so she bought me a name brand cleanse line called sheisido (I am pretty sure I spelled that wrong).  I was extremely grateful for that gift from my mom especially since thats pretty expensive, but it just did not work. So I did some research for what ingredients to look for in a face wash and saw that benzol peroxide was a key component and I realized that all of the products I used did not have it or had a low amount. I saw that oxy had 10% and bought it. I am on my fourth day of using this product and the big pimples I had have severely gone down and some of those acne islands have vanished! Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have pimples, but my face has cleared up a great deal, something the other products could not achieve. I am very optimistic about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I damp my face and gently rub the product on my face in a circular motion. I do this for 60 seconds. I believe that this gives the product sufficent time to work its magic and get into the pores to kill of the bacteria. If you simply put it on and wash it off right away, you are hindering oxy&#x27;s job productivity so you won&#x27;t see results or at least quick results. I then wash the product off and pat dry using a bleachable towel because if you use a regular one it willstain it. I then wait about 5-10 minutes before applying a non comegenic moisturizer. I think waiting before putting the moisturizer allows the oxy to concentrate on doing its job for a little longer. You must use moisterizer because oxy does dry the skin and if you do not use moisterizer, your sweat glands go into over drive making you extremely oily except you will still have dry patches or at least I do anyways. I will then apply the oxy spot treatment on my large pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your acne was as bad as mine, it will not clear up over night, but I swear you will see results soon enough. I really hope this helps!</li>
    <li> I liked it before when it had no smell. Now it has &amp;#34;new fresh&amp;#34; scent, which smells terrible. Still better than comparable ones, though.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this wash from Amazon because I was in a hurry to get some, so I found some locally.  For about a month I was having bad outbreaks -- the first time in over 20 years and couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  I tried another Proactive-type solution which worked for a few days, then was not effective anymore.  I got this (and the Oxy pads and spot treatment) and *overnight* I saw a massive improvement!  I&#x27;d say 90% of my acne problem is gone.  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with excessive dryness, though, I have oily skin.  I&#x27;m planning on going ahead and ordering this four pack now.</li>
    <li> I read some reviews online that tout this product as the best face wash to use for acne. Well I purchased a four pack and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it all up. It smells gross, like Milk of Magnesia, and if you leave it on your skin for a while according to the directions, it starts to burn because the active ingredient is so much stronger than other face wash products. You&#x27;ll be much happier if you get the blemish fighting St. Ives Apricot Scrub with the 2% Salicylic Acid. It smells better, and it has a sandy texture that exfoliates as you massage it into your skin. (update: fixed star rating)</li>
    <li> I buy this for my son and it works great!  Our pediatrician recommended it.  The only problem is that he has to use it in the shower because it does bleach out our towels.  This means a quick shower tiwice a day but it is better than having to deal with prescription meds.</li>
    <li> It is good for short term use. It clears the existing acne. BUT, if you keep using this on a regular basis, it will cause white heads like it did to me. It doesn&#x27;t clear face deeply which causes clogged pores and eventually more acne. So, I use this face wash as an emergency wash to get rid of the existing ones. My suggestion is, never use it for a long time.</li>
    <li> I once a couple of years ago, during a very bad break out came across OXY while shopping in a small drug store. Desperate for any kind of Acne relief I decided to give it a shot. I kid you not, no sooner did I put it on than my pimples started to shrink and were gone, WITHIN HOURS! So for the first time in at least five years I gave the stuff a whirl again today. They must of changed the formula a little bit between then and now, because it&#x27;s not as pasty and not nearly as strong. I left the stuff on of a little while and vola&#x27;! pimples half the size of what they were before. Now I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use this everyday if you have skin like mine. IT WILL DRY YOUR SKIN OUT! But it&#x27;s great for when you need to stop/reduce breakouts within hours. It&#x27;s so strong though... it kind of makes me worry about scarring...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2/12/2014 - So I after using this product for awhile every now and then and getting used to that \\&quot;slight\\&quot; burn I decided to swap it out for my daily face wash. I still have black heads but no ugly face scarring blemishes almost EVER! I love this product. They changed the bottle and the formula again, and it&#x27;s not AS strong but it still get the job done.</li>
    <li> My current health insurance sucks, but I don&#x27;t need a dermatologist with a homemade regimen including this product. This is the strongest non-prescription product I&#x27;ve used. WARNING! START GENTLER! This should only be used by people with experience with high benzoyl peroxide applications. It takes your face a while to adjust to it. It is super drying. You will have to use moisturizer afterwards. You must be consistent. Skip days and you will have break outs.   My regimen consist of:  1.) Oxy Max Face Wash (I use my Phisoderm Anti-Blemish Wash 2% Salicylic Acid if my face is feeling sensitive)  [...]  [...]/dp/B000Y038CS/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top  2.) (Optional) Buy 70% glycolic acid and dilute it 1 part acid 5 parts water. I use this as a toner/peel when needed.  [...]  3.) Aveeno Lotion  [...]  4.) Spot treat with Acne Terminator 10% Benzoyl Peroxide  [...]    This gives me prescription strength results on par with medications I have used. It is much cheaper.</li>
    <li> My son likes this product; my cousin recommended it to him.  She used to use Proactiv but noticed that her acne wasn&#x27;t getting better it was getting worse.  You can definitely see a difference between the Proactiv products that my son used before and the Oxy products that he uses now. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne that doesn&#x27;t seem to go away after using the Proactiv products; since this product has more medicine in it 10%.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products for my adult acne, both prescription and over-the-counter, but it wasn&#x27;t until I was 40 years old and tried this product that I found something that actually works. I rarely get pimples anymore and when I do they go away faster. This product is very easy to use. That&#x27;s important to men like me who don&#x27;t like spending a lot of time grooming. I just wash my face with it when I shower once a day. That&#x27;s it. Not only that, this product is cheaper than its non-working competitors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m worried that Oxy is going to stop making this, or has already done so. It&#x27;s getting harder to find. Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore, and I know of only one local store that has carried it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oxy 10% for about two years now. I remember when Benzoyl Peroxide was Rx-only at about $40 per bottle. This listing, as of this date, is under $5 per bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my secret recipe to NEVER get acne. I&#x27;m 31 and have had it BAD my entire life (face, neck and scalp) until I figured this out. Large painful cysts that HURT HURT HURT. Anyhow:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, Oxy 10%, in the shower after washing your face with soap. I even lather my hair with it. Rinse. Get out of the shower, dry your face off and IMMEDIATELY (while your pores are still open) AND LIBERALLY apply [[ASIN:B0002YFD24 Bump Patrol After Shave 2 oz. Intense Treatment]] - The Macaulay Culkin face-burn-screaming is well worth it. That&#x27;s the kicker. Oxy to clean down deep and Bump Patrol to keep it antiseptic and prevent acne-causing razor burn. I explicitly figured out this process about three months ago. For the first time in my life, I am acne free...for three months now.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash!  I get occasional breakouts still at the age of 28, but this face wash does a great job at limiting and getting rid of any breakouts.</li>
    <li> I definitely flare up a lot less using this and when I do flare up the puss is already dried up for easy removal. As of right now this is the best acne wash I&#x27;ve encountered. Ironically this doesnt dry out my skin like other products, which I&#x27;m suprised because it has 10% benzoyl peroxide.</li>
    <li> As an adult who has been dealing with moderate to severe acne for over 10 years, I have tried more products than I can even start to elaborate on. I more recently tried ProActive. Although my face felt soft, it looked terrible. I was developing different types of acne that I haven&#x27;t experience in years. Now having to try and undo the damage I decided to try the OXY Daily Scrub. I was a little concerned that it would try out my skin, because there is such a high amount of active ingredient in it. Its been four days and my skin looks soft, healthy, and wonderful. Twice a day with a moisturizer has been great. I definitely would not suggest using it more and really avoid the eyes. A little bit got into one of my eyes and it swelled shut. So be careful! Overall great product if used properly and intellectually. Acne and its awful scars don&#x27;t go away in a day</li>
    <li> This is great for backne (back breakouts). I work out everyday in 85-100 degree heat and my back was breaking out A LOT.  I was using the Panoxyl bar which is fantastic but it was discontinued. This has the same 10% Benzoyl Peroxide. I use this on my face only once a week but on my back and chest daily. To combat dryness just keep in mind that a little goes a loong way. I put mine in a pump dispenser. Two small pumps maximum. It doesn&#x27;t foam like other cleansers so you might be tempted to use more but too much and it&#x27;ll cause the dryness. Let it stay on for about 2 mins then wash off. A bottle lasts me 1-2 months. It&#x27;s been over a year and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. Still have the old scars though, lol. &#x3D;T Just use white towels after you shower because it will lighten your color fabrics.</li>
    <li> I have severe cystic acne and I have tried everything to clear it up, including Neutrogena Complete Acne Therapy System, ProActiv, AcneFree Severe and regular strength, Clearasil Ultra Acne Solution, and other drugstore acne products. None of them have worked to clear my breakouts and some of them seemed to make my acne worse, especially the ones with a toner. Now I use Oxy Maximum face wash, which doesn&#x27;t burn when applied and seems gentle even though it has 10% benzoyl peroxide. I prefer to use this product in the shower since it does tend to stain clothing. I work up a lather in my hands first and then apply all over my face for at least 2-3 minutes. Then I rinse with water but I try not to rub my face after rinsing. Then you have to pat dry with a white towel (it will bleach a colored one). Ever since I first started using this product my face has cleared 100%. I can honestly say that I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple appear on my face. It&#x27;s so refreshing to know that such a simple inexpensive product really worked better than all of the other three step expensive ones. I will be sticking with oxy for life!!</li>
    <li> The Oxy face wash is a good value. I use it every day, so it was cheaper to purchase in bulk. Arrived as described.</li>
    <li> Got tired of paying the high prices for Proactiv brand so I tried this and it works great.  I also buy this for my daughter and soon to be daughter in law and they like it just as well too.</li>
    <li> Ordered this a few weeks ago and been using it ever since. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin really compared with other products, and I have seen huge results! I&#x27;d recommend using twice a day (morning shower and before bed). If you need something to clear up your skin, go with this product.</li>
    <li> In my experience benzoyl peroxide is the best medicine for mild acne problems. And the 10% concentration is the highest you can get, so this already fits the bill. What makes this product great is not only do you get a lot for cheap, it also is almost completely odorless (which is often a problem with other cheap brands).  If you have mild acne then I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get this, it is likely to be the only thing you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> Shipment was fast and well packaged. Arrived on time. Excellent product!  This product was recommended by a Dermotolgist for my son. I use it too . We both has gotten great results. Our acne has cleared up with twice a day usage.</li>
    <li> The best product I found for my son&#x27; s terrible acne. It&#x27;s a billions times better than Proactive.&lt;br /&gt;His so happy with this product!! Please don&#x27;t take it out of market!!&lt;br /&gt;I love the pack of 4 that this time idk why it came with 5 bottles I&#x27;m so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I was tried of using name brand skin cleaner, hint, hint: Proactive. Not to say it does not work but, I needed fast and quick results. OXY clean works the best. Within a day or two you will see results on your skin.</li>
    <li> Works well if you have a slight problem with acne.  The face soap will help control some of the acne but not all. The product arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Someone on Youtube recommended this and I decided to give it a shot. The first time I tried this product I noticed a huge difference in my face and skin instead of washing the product off I left it on over night. The next morning I washed it off and a lot of my pimples dried up, the clusters of acne I had were not as red and swollen. The 2nd night that I left it on the pimples that dried from the day before completely flaked off. There was even less swelling acne and now a week later I no longer have any acne or pimples. What I do have however are the acne scars from over the years but I heard this product with continuous use can even fade those marks so I am hoping its true. This stuff is freaking amazing, I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with pimples or cystic acne my only advice is to be patient and don&#x27;t expect your face to clear up as quickly as mine because everyone is different but definitely give it a try this has been the only product to ever work for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a good, strong face wash that effectively helps get rid of acne. Don&#x27;t use too often or leave too long on the face though, because it can really dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I use this on top of my body wash to help keep my back clear. Its the only thing that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to wash it off thoroughly before getting out of the shower. I have definitely bleached a towel or two by not rinsing throughly, but this is definitely worth the risk. Keeps be clean and clear of embarrassing acne on my shoulders</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m from the UK and was using an over the counter acne cream that sort of did the job , on holiday to Orlando i popped into Walgreens  and saw this on offer for 2 for 1 so gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Wow this cleared my face up within a week (get the odd rogue spot but nothing major).&lt;br /&gt;Cant get this in the UK so  get the 4 pack from Amazon sent over.&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning its a pretty powerfull bleach on shirt collars , wasnt untill my missus did the weekly wash that she found 4 of my shirt collars bleached sort of yellowy.</li>
    <li> I use it as a leave in and it works better/cheaper than buying the cream. Not harsh on my face.</li>
    <li> Contains 10% Benzoyl Peroxide and is the only wash that we have found to be effective for our teenagers acne. You used to be able to get a similar product in the UK but due to changes in European law, products with &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; ingredients like Benzoyl Peroxide are now classed as medicines and are much more difficult to obtain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon makes it easy, I order from the UK, Best Buy New York pops it in a padded envelope and it arrives at my door in less than a week. Buying the 4 pack means that the price is reasonable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t get much easier than that.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of different face wash products over the years, but once I found this one, I was satisfied. I noticed that instead of 2% salicylic acid, the main ingredient was 10% benzoyl peroxide. I have very oily skin and this works great for me. It washed my face without drying it out too much. If you have dry skin or need a gently cleanser, this is not the product for you. But if you have a lot of oily buildup, this will cut right through it and give you a great fresh face.</li>
    <li> Its not a bad product and perhaps works, but one should be aware of a few draw backs.  One, this product like many others will dry your skin out.  Two, if you don&#x27;t really, I mean Really, rinse your skin off completely and then use a colored towel to dry your face, it will BLEACH out the towel.  I switch over to just having a completely WHITE towel at the ready and that has helped.</li>
    <li> This a great product for people with acne. It does dry your skin a bit but it will clear up 95% of your acne. This is the best price I can find this product online enough though it comes all the way from the States.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It works&lt;br /&gt;2. Expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. Too thin thus you tend to pour more than needed&lt;br /&gt;2. Updated container (tube type) has smaller quantity (5 oz in tube vs 6 oz above)&lt;br /&gt;3. Pack of 4 not available anymore in Amazon Prime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend Pan Oxyl because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cheaper&lt;br /&gt;2. Thicker and thus able to regulate amount to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link: http://www.amazon.com/PanOxyl-Acne-Foaming-Wash-5-5-Ounce/dp/B004AI565W/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1395584432&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;panoxyl</li>
    <li> I loved the OLD FORMULA, why on earth do companies change their products :( it&#x27;s just so mean to loyal customers. Anyways the first time I used the old formula it was fabulous I&#x27;ve had acne since I was in 5th grade nothing worked. Starting using it freshman year and for two years of using it, no more acne I had beautiful clear skin. But then they made a new formula and the first thing I noticed was the smell. It smells heavier than the original one that had a slight scent but nothing overpowering. This new scent smells like men&#x27;s cologne. And has done nothing for my skin. I haven&#x27;t bought a bottle ever since.</li>
    <li> It seemed to clean well enough and lathered okay with the little amount I was using once a day. But I won&#x27;t know the extent of how well it could have worked or cleaned as I had to stop its use. The worst thing about this cleanser was that it made my skin incredibly dry. At the time I had a little amount of acne, which the dryness aggravated. I&#x27;ve since found a benzyl peroxide that does work without the excessive drying (and no, I am in no way sponsored to endorse it):  [[ASIN:B00164FKWW Acne.org 8 oz. Treatment]]</li>
    <li> Allot of people could use this product alone to stop breakouts if they have moderate adult acne but people with bigger adult acne problems should really try this product and Neutrogena Deep Clean Invigorating Foaming Scrub along with controlling or eliminating processed sugars in their diet before resorting to a Dermatologist. I have spent ALLOT of money on Dermatologist appointments, medications (which often damage the Liver or Kidneys) and the MD&#x27;s brand of acne wash - most of which did little more in the long term than damage my body and wallet.    My first hand recommendation for moderate to severe adult acne. While in the shower, use the Neutrogena scrub (mentioned above), rinse, then use this product (same amount of Benzoyl Peroxide as the MD wash) and rinse. If starting during a severe breakout, perform 2x per day but no more (because of skin drying). You should see results within 2-3 days and clear skin within 1-4 weeks (depending on severity of the infection). Finally, listen to your body before listening to the flip/flop notion that diet doesn&#x27;t play a part in acne - certain refined/processed sugars (usually from desserts and candy) provoke skin secretions that initiate and worsen acne. I don&#x27;t know how this treatment would work on teen acne but I wish I had the chance to try it when I was a teen.    I would also recommend getting some bleach friendly bath towels - Benzoyl Peroxide bleaches cloth and linen. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I have to admit to being surprised that this worked at all, let alone worked as well as it has. Even using it only every other day has made a real difference in the condition of my skin; I have fewer breakouts and the breakouts I do have are minimized. I&#x27;ve always been a little skeptical of cleansers that are medicated. The medication in them is on your skin for only a few seconds, but this one is definitely effective. OTOH, it is VERY drying, even this time of year (mid-summer in a very humid climate.) This will be uncomfortably drying for anyone who doesn&#x27;t have just super-oily skin, and even as oily as my skin is (very) I can already tell that I will not be able to use this on my face year-round (though others have suggested using it in the shower for back acne if you are plagued with that as well.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those with DRY/COMBINATION and SENSITIVE skin, though, BEWARE. This will NOT be kind to your skin type. Don&#x27;t buy this in a multi-pack (this particular buying option is a 4-pack) unless you&#x27;re certain your skin can handle it. There are single-bottle ordering options elsewhere on Amazon and on a certain, popular online drugstore or you can look for it in your local drugstore. Additionally, it&#x27;s reasonably priced so you won&#x27;t feel as if you wasted an entire paycheck if it doesn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only medication ingredient in it is benzoyl peroxide; you will still need a BHA and/or an AHA product to help exfoliate your skin to keep your pores clear and further prevent blackheads and whiteheads. To those with cystic acne, you&#x27;ll definitely need to use prescription medications -- topical and likely oral as well -- along with this; by itself, it won&#x27;t do much for severe, cystic acne.  But for those with very oily, non-sensitive skin and moderate breakouts, this is an excellent addition to your regimen for once/day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But do be careful when ordering a \\&quot;medicated\\&quot; product from an independent, online seller, especially if the price is considerably lower than the standard retail. I don&#x27;t have to warn experienced shoppers that sometimes independent sellers offer less-than-pure/authentic products, or products that are well past their expiration date. Some are mixed with lower-grade ingredients, are thin and diluted or are just old and no longer effective.

The vast majority of Amazon Marketplace sellers are honest and will bend over backwards to offer the best customer service they can, often at their own expense.

They NEED to be CERTAIN that the products they&#x27;re purchasing are the real thing.

That is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(PS. The benzoyl peroxide in this WILL bleach out your clothes and towels, so be careful when using it, and don&#x27;t use non-colorfast washcloths.

    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me :/    But be careful where you apply this. I got a milia under my eye while using this. Whether it was caused by Oxy or not, I was noob and had user error. The error? Don&#x27;t be like me and know that the place under your eye is thin (and such) so I recommend that you dont apply any cleanser to that area.     btw I give it 2/5 not because of the milia but because it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> i love this product, my whole household uses this product. great for controlling acnes.buy it you will like it...great facewash</li>
    <li> Oxy Face Wash is getting hard to find in the stores and works better than any other product I have tried. I apply it first thing in the shower every morning and rinse it off as the last thing.</li>
    <li> have ordered several times from them - works great!</li>
    <li> I throwed it in my trash can. I tested and skin is become more darker.</li>
    <li> I have tried several brands of acne face wash and have been left feeling disappointed. I typically get break outs down in my neck area, which were irritated by shaving. I figured I would give this a try an noticed that it began to work within a few days. I also noticed that my shaving experience improved by leaps and bounds. It is very easy to apply and wash off. The only thing I will say to watch out for is that it will stain your clothing, which they warn you about, so be careful if you are applying with clothing on. Other than that this is a great product that worked well for me.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It works well but is really drying. I don&#x27;t recommend using it every day, just during break outs.</li>
    <li> I tried numerous salicylic acid products before this and none of them helped my acne; they just resulted in dry skin.  I chose this benzoyl peroxide product because it was low cost compared to other products.  My acne began clearing up within the first week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend benzoyl peroxide over salicylic acid for treatment of acne and I prefer it in the form of a face wash rather than a cream or a wipe because it tends to dry my skin less and there is no danger of rubbing my face and accidentally getting it in my eyes.  There is also less danger of it bleaching any clothing that might touch my face.</li>
    <li> Nice product with a pleasant scent that works quite well for me. I tried this product as a replacement for Panoxyl face wash. After using it for a while i have added it to my subscribe &amp; save orders.</li>
    <li> The new packaging is not the only thing new (the old tube was magenta and black - the new has orange lettering added saying &amp;#34;New Look.&amp;#34;) I have only been using it 3 or 4 days, and I am breaking out - a huge zit the size of a quarter on my cheek and several on my chin. Why would they change a winning formula? I would have paid more for the old one!</li>
    <li> I have bought this at a fraction of price then usual stores. It work2 great ! would recoomend it for light acne.</li>
    <li> My doctor recommended a benzoyl peroxide wash for back acne so I tried this and it works well. The only thing to watch out for is bleaching of towels. I thought I would avoid this by washing off well with soap and water and a washcloth, but no, some of the towels I used to dry off after the shower got bleached. It doesn&#x27;t seem to affect all towels, but now I use white just to be safe. Let the product stay on your skin for several minutes to give it a chance to work.</li>
    <li> This stuff gave me worse acne.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it does contain a key ingredient in the battle against your acne. I have really bad acne though, so I didn&#x27;t expect this to get rid of even %15 percent of my acne. But it came in a pack of 4 for just 20 bucks. Can&#x27;t go wrong. I almost used em all up (have a little left in a bottle) the course of half a year and I still have acne. Will I buy this product again? Maybe. Sometimes you just gotta try again. Remember, Benzoyl Peroxide and Salycic Acid are key ingredients for fighting acne. I recommend trying some pricey women products, like anti-aging and all that, just to see if caring for your skin using women products would be a stronger fight against acne. Hope this review helps.</li>
    <li> This soap works reallly well. I went to see my doctor and she recommended this product. It doesn&#x27;t over dry your face and produces enough lather to make you feel like it&#x27;s working.  I know it works by the results though.</li>
    <li> This product has helped me sooo much for well over a decade. UNFORTUNATLY.., the frontside bottle pictured here (unscented version)is no longer available.If you look closly on the photo of ingredients it is the NEW version w added fragrance. Having easily aggreivatated skin, fragrance is the last thing I need to apply to my face. I bought the fragranced one thinking it was the original then spent two days wondering why i kept smelling grandpas cologne. Also my skin increased oil production because my face skin just can&#x27;t handle fragrance. I once would swear BUY! this product ,but adding fragrance was a real \\&quot;zitty\\&quot; idea.Sorely disappointed.. guess I&#x27;ll continue my search for a new face wash and pray I don&#x27;t have to go back to dermatologist side affect gel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used oxy for a long time...going on about 8 years now. It was a MIRACLE worker...but I&#x27;ve finally ran out of the old trusty bottle and had to buy the new one. The formula is COMPLETELY different. I&#x27;ve only used it for one day...haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference, but worried I might breakout (I was a lil greasier today). Crossing my fingers Oxy is still the same old trusty stuff it&#x27;s always been. I kept my old bottle so I could compare them...I&#x27;ve listed the info below. If anyone knows why or what exactly the change is for, I&#x27;d LOVE to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old Formula (in correct order): active ingredient 10% benzoyl peroxide, inactive ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, cocamidopropyl betaine, diazolidinyl urea, methylparaben, propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, xanthan gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Formula (in correct order): active ingredient 10% benzoyl peroxide, inactive ingredients: anhydrous citric acid, butylene glycol (new ingredient!), capryl/capramidopropyl betaine (new), cetostearyl alcohol (new), cocamidopropyl betaine, diazolidinyl urea, disodium PEG- 5 laurylcitrate sulfosuccinate (new), fragrance (new), hydrolyzed soy protein (new), hydroxyphenyl propamidobenzoic acid (new), methylparaben, PEG-8 dimethicone (new), pentylene glycol (new), propylparaben, purified water, sodium citrate,  sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, xanthan gum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see above...they&#x27;ve changed it quite a bit. I&#x27;m no chemist...but I do know that the closer the ingredient is listed to the top, the greater the amount. And it looks like a lot of the \\&quot;old ingredients\\&quot; have been pushed to the bottom and the ones above them are an alcohol of some sort and fragrance...which aren&#x27;t good for your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory....now that Walmart is making their own Equate brand of OXY, OXY has two choices they can make 1) improve their formula or 2) Make their product cheaper by cutting corners on ingredients. From the looks of things...it looks like they&#x27;re trying to cut corners, but market a \\&quot;new formula\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update in a month to let you know if I still get the same results as the old one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: So after trying it out for quite some time - the breakouts just kept coming. I didn&#x27;t want to update this post until I&#x27;d found something that works. My face&#x27;s new best friend: Pan Oxyl. I&#x27;d never heard of them before but saw them at Walmart and decided to try it out because it had 10% benzoyl peroxide and didn&#x27;t have fragrance. The stuff kicks butt.  I have a pretty strict face routine - I wash my face with warm water, use Pan Oxyl, pat dry with a face towel I replace every week, and then CeraVe moisturizer. ALWAYS make sure to use face lotion after this bad boy - it dries you out, but if you were a traditional OXY user, you already know this. My only reservation with Pan Oxyl is that their top ingredient is an alcohol - but it works better than the new OXY.  Again, I&#x27;m not a chemist, so perhaps that type of alcohol isn&#x27;t as bad as the one OXY uses? I have no idea, I just know the stuff seems to work. Anybody find another product that is a good replacement for OXY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in answer to your question - the new OXY comes in a squeezable large toothpaste-like container, while the old is a hard plastic with finger grips on the side.</li>
    <li> This has the highest percentage of benzoil peroxide I have been able to find over the counter, although the new version has light fragrance, which I would rather it didn&#x27;t have.</li>
    <li> I love my natural products, reducing my footprint, staying away from corporate products. But when something works, it works. This works, keeps acne to a minimum, and is the only thing I found other than Acutane that can do that. Wish I&#x27;d been a regular user when I was a teen, could have saved a lot of embarrassment!</li>
    <li> I was using this on my back for over a year with awesome results but then they changed the formulation and now it breaks me out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years and it does as promised.  I first started using this wash to clear acne and now I use it to prevent acne.  I don&#x27;t find it to be drying and it doesn&#x27;t bleach my eyebrows and towels like other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s an effective and affordable way to treat acne.</li>
    <li> It works OK on my back, but you must use it 1-2 times per day and it works best if you leave it  on for a couple of minutes. I scrub it in with a Buff Puff back scrubber. The issue is, I used to be able to use it once per day or every 2-3 days before. It&#x27;s not as pure or potent as it used to be. I&#x27;m sure they cut it with fillers to cut down on cost. What every happened to the body wash by Oxy??? That worked well. It disappeared off the market. Can&#x27;t find it on the internet or in any store! Very frustrating.</li>
    <li> Got it free with app trailer in the app store pretty good dose not make my skin dry and it dose it job but got a 4 because it is no miracle worker .......oh and if you make an account with app trailer use my name to get 50 points easy helpme510</li>
    <li> I have had mild to moderate acne since I was 12. Few products have made much of a difference and believe me I have tried many of them. From antibiotics to Retin A to Acutane. Nothing seemed to really work for very long without more serious side affects. This product seems to really help. I am amazed. It is simple, inexpensive with few side affects. It is crazy that I didn&#x27;t know about it before. I think I have used a face wash with Benzoyl Peroxide, but never anything with 10%. I think the strength is the key!</li>
    <li> Only thing I have found that really works.i have ordered it three times. You just have to leave it on for about a minute.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after I researched the ingredients in Proactive. This was one of the best products with Benzoyl Peroxide so I thought I would give it a try. I was not disappointed. I got the same results that I did from Proactiv at a fraction of the cost. I will literally never go back. A Toner to follow up with this product is witch hazel, which is an ingredient that is commonly found in many acne products. Try this, you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> That is insane. Not buying from here again. My first 4 bottle purchase was only $24 Is there a shortage or something?</li>
    <li> I researched this to determine which product to get for my children to help with their pimples. This was rated right up there with Proactiv and much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses my wife and I could already see a difference on our daughters faces. They are very happy with the results and we plan to stick with the Oxy Maximum.</li>
    <li> You will not find a better acne wash for this price out there. Large bottles with a 10% benzoyl peroxide punch. Very good product to use without prescription.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal proactiv user since my freshman year in hs when I first started getting pimples. It cleared my skin and whenever I tried to use something else my skin would break out horribly. I&#x27;m 26 now and I&#x27;m sick of spending so much time on my face and having to wait for proactiv to get to my house. I wanted over the counter face wash!!! An oxy add popped up on my Facebook about 2 weeks ago, I went to store n bought it, and haven&#x27;t looked back. I love this stuff!! One step, cheap, can go to any store n buy it whenever I want...perfect :)</li>
    <li> I know, sounds like I work for the company doesn&#x27;t it. :)  But it is true.  Stop paying so much for other products when this one will keep your face clear - without drying it out.  And make sure you are using the &#x27;maximum&#x27; (10%) and not the standard.  Couldn&#x27;t find the Maximum Oxy once and so went with the 2% and it didn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Started buying this when I was unable to find the PanOxyl and then they bumped their pricing in stores by 50%.  Now we&#x27;re an Oxy family.  The pads are great to take when camping or hiking - which always made my face break out.</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not as good as Proactiv, as it does not have exfoliating beads the product is a good alternative. The product has a very &amp;#34;milky&amp;#34; feel to it and has a little bit of fragrance. The problem with this is that it tends to bleed through the cap and makes a mess if you don&#x27;t close the flap correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially only used it 30 seconds in the morning and at night but continues to get breakouts. It is recommended that you lather it on for 50-60 seconds in the morning and at night to achieve maximum effectiveness. I suggest a salicylic acid moisturizer and weekly exfoliating (the ones with beads) face wash to go with it. It removes all the excess dead cells so you are achieving the best results with this as it does not have exfoliating beads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes sure you get ones where the beads are uniform (similar in sizes) so you do not iritate your face, or worse, scar it. Over the counter scrubs are notorious for this, especially those &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or fruity scrubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Men Face Scrub works well:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Nivea-Energy-Scrub-4-4-Oz-Tubes/dp/B001FB5IGY/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1355351417&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;men+facial+scrub</li>
    <li> Like this product. A little goes a long way. Delivered at a great price fast</li>
    <li> This price is a total RIP OFF!! You can get a 8floz bottle at Walmart for $7... So why am I paying $8 for a smaller bottle!?? Didn&#x27;t realize until after I got it that I overspent :( next time I&#x27;ll just buy them at Walmart individually!!</li>
    <li> This is my go to for face wash. I recommend combining it with an xfoliator, or at least using a towel to help exfoliate while using this product to get the most out of it. If you on&#x27;t have acne, or have over-dryed your skin before, look into something with less than 10%</li>
    <li> I work out a lot so regular use of this product keeps me from breaking out but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much.</li>
    <li> Strong, but keeps my acne away post Accutane (second course). Try to keep away from nice towels though because it can stain.</li>
    <li> I WAS HAPPY WHEN I FOUND THIS ONLINE.  I COULD NO LONGER FIND IT IN STORES HERE AND MY DAUGHTER ABSOLUTELY LOVES THIS STUFF, THANKS</li>
    <li> Using daily, this cleared up my face completely in less than a month. I continue to use it daily. However, because it is so harsh, your face will pump out oil. It&#x27;s a tradeoff between clear, greasy skin and having acne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  I still on occasion get break outs but along with my other skin care regime this stuff works.  No offensive odor.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Husband was prescribed 10% Benzoyl Peroxide wash and had been buying this at big box store. No longer available. This pack of 4 is a great value.</li>
    <li> This product when used regularly can really make a difference, but it takes time and commitment.  Don&#x27;t expect results the very next day.  It will help dry out some of the oiliness and reduce the inflamation but acne still will take a while to go away.  If your acne is very strong you&#x27;ll need to use maybe twice a day.  Start slow and maybe use every other day first to test your reaction to it.  Its strong and may dry your skin out so just be aware that you may either need to use less frequently or use some mosturizer.  I use this every time I shower and after a few weeks I can notice a significant difference.  But when I stop using it comes back.  Also you need to practice other good habits.  Don&#x27;t pick at your skin.  I think the picking is the hardest thing to avoid, but if you avoid it and use this product you&#x27;ll notice a difference.  Also you probably want to avoid any other chemicals.</li>
    <li> Best Face wash Ever! Cleared my skin up in like to weeks. Couldn&#x27;t find it at the drugstore anymore so I buy it off here in the 3 pack which last me forever! Love love love this stuff!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted. Got her quickly. Now I&#x27;m just trying to get more words to meet the minimum word requirement.</li>
    <li> Love this! Huge difference in my face! After trying product after product I finally found something simple and amazing that gets the job done!!</li>
    <li> Just for my skin type, this product gives better results than salicylic acid based products. It&#x27;s not as good as peroxide products with microdermabrasion, but for the price, it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> You get alot of product for the money and wow 10% benzoyl peroxide?!  I have a crazy adult acne and this seems to be helping with my prescriptions that I&#x27;m using.</li>
    <li> I have used oxy face wash for many years. It was the only product that truly worked for me. I would stock up on it cause it was extremely hard to find as stores would sell out. After my last stock ran out i bought the new version. Not the same at all!! Actually caused a huge breakout that Im still battling a month later. Im very sad they changed the formula. I will now have to search for a new miracle worker :(</li>
