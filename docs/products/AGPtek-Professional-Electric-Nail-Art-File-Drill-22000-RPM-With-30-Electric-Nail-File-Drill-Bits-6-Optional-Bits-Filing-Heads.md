      <li>THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE CLEAR INSTRUCTION ON USING</li>
      <li>The drill is light with very little vibration.</li>
      <li>It will take some practice to get is down right.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for the time being until I get my Medicol drill fixed &amp; until I get a different one.</li>
      <li>To me its the same as my old one.</li>

<li> the drill is heavy!</li>
<li> Which I don&#x27;t understand because it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard to put in &amp; remove the drill bits.</li>
<li> For a 30,000 RPM drill, it feels really weak.</li>
<li> Makes crazy sound,smells like wire burning,drill still runs when foot is not on foot pad.</li>
<li> Awful!!!!</li>
<li> hate to give it even one star!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this nail drill it does a good job its kind of noisey but other than that good. It got here quick and undamaged.</li>
    <li> I Love what this product is capable of doing. After I took a fitting off and changed it I tried to change again and I Cant get it to unlock so if IM not needing the fitting on there that&#x27;s stuck. I Cant use it.So IM limited to that one piece.</li>
    <li> It was ok for a tempary .</li>
    <li> I love this product, helps me perfect my nails exactly how i want them. It&#x27;s also very easy to use as well.</li>
    <li> Returning it. Makes crazy sound,smells like wire burning,drill still runs when foot is not on foot pad. Oh not to mention not a defect but the drill is heavy!</li>
    <li> I purchased this drill as a back-up to the Medicool I have at the salon.  I keep this one at home so that I do not have to bring my drill home from the salon to do my own nails at home.  This drill does a great job.  It runs smoothly w/out skipping.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> THEY DON&#x27;T HAVE CLEAR INSTRUCTION ON USING</li>
    <li> As soon as I got the drill I set it up. I filed a set of nails,, I turned of the machine as I was looking over the extra things I had ordered the machine blew up!!!! No joke about 30 seconds after I stopped using it I smelled a little smoke then I heard a snap crackle and a loud POP!!!!!  Im so glad that my face wasn&#x27;t anywhere near this piece of junk!!! I boxed it up and its waiting for UPS to pick it up!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give it even one star!!!!</li>
    <li> I wanted a drill/file with a pedal, and this does come with one but you still have to adjust speed with the knob. Dont understand why the pedal doesn&#x27;t control the speed. To me its the same as my old one.</li>
    <li> Never got to use it ... It was plugged up and blew apart started smokin I was so existed to get this and now I&#x27;m havin to send it back can&#x27;t even get another one because there is none left. Very upsetting .....</li>
    <li> After about two months of using this drill my hand piece just stopped spinning!!!!!!!! I liked the machine until this happened</li>
    <li> Was purchased as gift and it was a hit....  They loved it.  It was perfect...Would recommend for anyone to purchase</li>
    <li> I use it weekly and has really been handy.&lt;br /&gt;I would have loved to have a bit chart on which bit is used for what</li>
    <li> How can you sell product like this? I started my own nail care at home as a hobby. Decided to purchase electric nail filer so it would be convenient. Not only it doesn&#x27;t grind the nail nicely, you immediately smell electric burning. Awful!!!!</li>
    <li> For a 30,000 RPM drill, it feels really weak. I&#x27;m using it for the time being until I get my Medicol drill fixed &amp; until I get a different one. I had a bit of trouble with putting in the drill bit &amp; taking it out but it takes practice. Which I don&#x27;t understand because it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard to put in &amp; remove the drill bits. It&#x27;s good as a back up drill. It&#x27;s good for use when you don&#x27;t do nails everyday. But otherwise, for real professional use. . .you get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> I got this drill for my daughter on Christmas she did her nails that night and loved it! When she got it back out to redo her nails the part that opens to release the bit was locked and wouldn&#x27;t let it go, we finally got it out and now we cant put any other bits in. It seems like the hole shrunk. I was very pleased at first but to only be able to use this once is ridiculous and I am very dissapointed for the amount I paid.</li>
    <li> It works great for doing my acrylic nails. It will take some practice to get is down right. I still run back to my files! But this has everything you need in it to get started. The drill is light with very little vibration. The motor itself is actually smaller than it looks in the picture. Which is a great plus. The cord from the file to the motor is a bit short but otherwise this file should last for a while the little bit I do with it!</li>
    <li> The original bit wont come out i have tried every thing. It&#x27;s suppose to be a simple twist and it pops out but that was not the case for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect for someone like me who is disgusted with my nail techs that refuse to clean my nails and allow moisture underneath them and fungus to grow. Comes with sooooo many different tips.. there is a tip for ever size and shape possible!! I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to do their nails themselves or even a business with it. So far it has not let me down!</li>
    <li> Stop working in a very short time</li>
    <li> when i first recieved package everything was well organized. drill works well. i didnt expect to have so many drill bits. so i let everyonbe know if it last very long</li>
    <li> it was a gift for my wife, for Christmas and she loved it, now she does her nails without going to a the nail salon..&lt;br /&gt;thanks for the great service.</li>
