<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Somewhat perfume-y, and not truly lavender essential oil scent.  Nice product though - what to expect from Bath and Body.  As directed on the bottle as amount for bubble baths, this bottle would only last 9 bubble baths - I just use less than recommended.</li>
    <li> it relaxes the body pretty well for the end of the day bed time. Will tell my friends about how good it does.</li>
    <li> This body wash is amazing. I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore. I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant and my bubble bath time is probably the best time of the day for me. The &amp;#34;sleep&amp;#34; phrase in the name of this is true. I&#x27;ve gotten so relaxed that I find myself nodding off! Highly recommend product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and leaves you feeling clean fresh and comfy. It is really relaxing , the light scent that it leaves on your skin.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great,smells wonderful,makes you feel relaxed,softens skin,I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This is the most relaxing body soap in the world. And the scent is to sleep for.!!</li>
    <li> Been so long since I purchased these.  Love BB&#x27;s sleep body wash.  Smells good and is soft on the skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister because she couldn&#x27;t sleep at night and I wanted her to get some rest.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews and it was said to work like a charm I just hopes it works for her.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used this product for years!  We love it and Amazon has a better price.</li>
    <li> Happy with this product.  Refreshing and easily use.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Does not calm me down or relax me though. I still like to use it in as a bubble bath.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product.  I was purchasing them here in CA., and sending them to Hawaii.  Very expensive ordeal.  I found them on Amazon, with the same price, and free shipping with my Prime membership.  What a savings!  Now, I do not need to wait for a sale to say &amp;#34;I love you&amp;#34;.  This product is so relaxing, and the clean smell fills the house.  I think that&#x27;s aromatherapy.  But, whatever, we really like it.</li>
    <li> So calming and soothing. Smells amazing. I have the whole Sleep Lavender-Chamomile collection (body mist, lotion, body wash, and linen spray). I usually only wear it at home before I go to bed and it really does make falling asleep a little easier. Very relaxing and pleasant fragrance. Definitely a favorite! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I thought it was oil because I search for oil and this was a product which appeared</li>
    <li> Nice smelling body wash for taking a shower before you go to bed. Very relaxing scent.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE LAVENDER/CHAMOMILE PRODUCTS AND LOVE ALL OF THEM, EVEN THO I CANNOT FIND THE 3-WICK CANDLE ANYMORE, AND IT WAS...&amp;#34;THE VERY BEST&amp;#34;......I DECIDED TO ORDER THESE PRODUCTS FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, FOR CHRISTMAS....THEY LOVE THEM ALSO!!!</li>
    <li> I LOVE anything with Lavender and this really does help with relaxation.  Great product that I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended from a friend to help relax at night. It has a nice aroma and I now use it regularly. Good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and love the aroma that lasts through the night.  It is very soothing and not too strong an aroma.</li>
    <li> this product is flipping awesome! bought the lotion as well and when I use it it makes me sleep like a baby</li>
    <li> the product ranks fair in my opinion.  the smell is awesome, but soap and bubble quality average.  What else to say.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this fragrance! It&#x27;s so nice! Unfortunately buying from this seller was a waste of time. I might as well have gone to my local Bath and Body Works to begin with. The bottle came in a dinky little padded envelope and so when I received it, it was cracked and leaking all over! I had to go to my local Bath and Body Works and thankfully they were nice enough to exchange it. Great product, but horrible packaging.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites from B&amp;BW. Smell is soooo soothing. Apply the lotion after and you&#x27;ll feel so refreshed!</li>
    <li> The scent is so soothing and it lingers wherever I go.</li>
    <li> Hard to find at a good price.  Love the Stress Relief formulas but hate going into Bath and Body works due to overwhelming smells so ordering online is for me.  Fast delivery.  Great  Thanks</li>
    <li> OMG! I really like this! Although, I prefer Eucalyptus Spearmint. I decided to try this one for the first time. And it smells pretty good. The scent sticks to my skin very well long after I&#x27;ve taken a shower. Now, if only I can figure out how to not oversleep when my alarm clock goes off...lol This body wash knocks me right on out after I use it at night. I love it!</li>
    <li> The Lavender Chamomile 10 oz. Body Wash smells very good and lathers well.  It is a good value for the money.</li>
