      <li>Very pleased .</li>
      <li>Ideally I&#x27;d recommend trying to find a syringe with a flexible tip, as it is possible to scratch your tonsils with any plastic syringe, but this is honestly one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>

      <li>/&gt;However, I believe it has helped me prevent more tonsil stones from forming.</li>
      <li>Plastic syringe that works and can be reused many times.</li>
      <li>so Im glad</li>
      <li>Will def order more when I need them</li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t chew on the end, but I have no doubt it&#x27;ll hold up after many uses.</li>
      <li>Great product for those, like me, who might have a tooth or three which naturally fell out and food gets caught in the tooth socket-</li>
      <li>Fast shipping and a good product for irrigating tonsil stones.</li>
      <li>syringe is easy to fill and held its seal while I used it for about 2-3 weeks&lt;</li>
      <li>This is more of a portable device for on the go or just for quick use.</li>
      <li>Easy to fill and clean and LEAK FREE -</li>
      <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>(medication dispensing syringes are available, but do not have the advantages listed above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We bought this syringe as a sort of light weight replacement for the home Waterpik when we were traveling in areas where we use bottled water to brush the teeth.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great for irrigating deep gum pockets without carrying an array of appliances when traveling.</li>
      <li>Nothing fancy or innovative, just exactly what you need</li>
      <li>So I filled this up to the top and was able to use a single fill-up on my top and bottom gum areas without having to stop and refill again.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>sure you don&#x27;t use too much pressure, or you will cut your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This Ezy Care Dental Irrigating Syringe is so easy to use and it really works well!</li>
      <li>I now have some areas that are too tight for the floss, and this syringe works great.  </li>
      <li>does what i need it to do, good deal, thanks alot and now for a few more words</li>
      <li>Came quick and exactly as described.</li>
      <li>However, it cleans my gums and gum-line better than I expected it to clean!</li>
      <li>A gentle way to keep the socket clean after a tooth extraction.  </li>
      <li>(This happened to me the first time I used this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Nice small stream for accurately getting between teeth.</li>
      <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get it in the exact spot I needed.</li>
      <li>Thanks, amazon!</li>
      <li>It is good for hard to reach places, esp areas unreachable with floss.  </li>
      <li>Still better than nothing, but not much.</li>
      <li>using this device, it is much easier to take the plunger out, then fill the reservoir with your water/saltwater/etc solution.  </li>
      <li>Works very well for cleaning in between teeth.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier than trying to fill it like you would a syringe.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have a very strong gag reflex, so I was hoping this would irritate me less than swabbing my tonsil.</li>
      <li>this fits into my travel bag easily and stays dry and ready to use.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a quick fix, when I stumbled across reviews from different customers about this product...</li>
      <li>/&gt;- water stream pressure from the syringe is not too high</li>
      <li>Ease of use around the gum line - Here is a tip - be sure you place your head slightly down when you do this and aim it directly on the gum-line.</li>
      <li>Had my wisdom teeth removed a few weeks ago and this syringe is a must for keeping the area clean!  </li>
      <li>Your significant other, family, and friends will be grateful.     </li>
      <li>To clean it I just placed both pieces of this under a stream of very hot water and fully dried and put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>You can flood the area gently with water to clean out small spaces where floss and picks won&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>so it did not hurt my post-surgery sensitive gums</li>
      <li>This high quality Ezy Care Dental Irrigating Syringe I have found so helpful for my dental health that I recommend this to you for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Larger than most syringes for this purpose, with a curved tip for hard to reach places.  </li>
      <li>For this not being an actual pulsating water pik type of device, I was still surprised at</li>
      <li>Make sure you wait at least a week for the area to heal to avoid dry socket.</li>
      <li>I need a smaller (more like a needle thin end) to get up in the gum and tooth area.</li>
      <li>This little tool was really helpful when I got my wisdom teeth and tonsils out.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works GREAT for clearing out tonsil stones; aka tonsilolits.  This product is not designed to replace floss or water-picks (water-picks are not good for your gums btw).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-When using this device, it is much easier to take the plunger out, then fill the reservoir with your water/saltwater/etc solution.  It&#x27;s much easier than trying to fill it like you would a syringe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Make sure you don&#x27;t use too much pressure, or you will cut your mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-When you are done using it, seperate the two parts and let it air dry so that you reduce the amount of bacterial growth.  After a while, you should either sterilize or replace the product (it is something that you will be putting in your mouth, after-all)</li>
    <li> I purchased this with hopes of removing a tonsil stone. I have a very strong gag reflex, so I was hoping this would irritate me less than swabbing my tonsil. I was not able to remove the stone with this syringe. I even numbed the back of my throat, but I could not get it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I believe it has helped me prevent more tonsil stones from forming. It has a curved tip that makes it so I can angle it to hit my tonsil without making me gag. I just couldn&#x27;t get it in the exact spot I needed. It seems like it may also be good for people with crowns or braces to have as a backup to an electric waterpik.</li>
    <li> We bought this syringe as a sort of light weight replacement for the home Waterpik when we were traveling in areas where we use bottled water to brush the teeth.    Unfortunately, the device hold very little water, is hard to draw in liquid because of a small siphon opening and is awkward to hold in a way that generates any real power.  Still better than nothing, but not much.</li>
    <li> If you have tonsil stones, you won&#x27;t regret buying this. Ideally I&#x27;d recommend trying to find a syringe with a flexible tip, as it is possible to scratch your tonsils with any plastic syringe, but this is honestly one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for tonsil stones like some people have said.  They don&#x27;t come out when I use this.  Which is what I bought it for.  But that could vary person to person.  It is useful for other little things though so it is still handy to have.</li>
    <li> For a cheapie piece of plastic this one seems like it&#x27;ll last a while. The plunger gasket is air 100% air tight (tested). No leakage. Nice small stream for accurately getting between teeth. It&#x27;s still a disposable plastic product so I wouldn&#x27;t chew on the end, but I have no doubt it&#x27;ll hold up after many uses. I bought two just in case :)</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t generate enough pressure.</li>
    <li> If you have tonsil stones, get this product. Your significant other, family, and friends will be grateful.     Be careful not to squirt too hard and damage the tonsil, and don&#x27;t jam it down into the cavity or press it against the skin while squirting. This can be painful and can even damage the tonsil, but if you are gentle and use a flashlight to get a clear view, you will wonder how you ever went without this product.</li>
    <li> Recently had my wisdom teeth removed, and kept getting food stuck in the holes in my gums that were left behind. This did the job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my impacted wisdom tooth in the back of my mouth. There&#x27;s a hole there in the gums, and food gets stuck. It works well. It shipped quickly and is a good price. Thanks, amazon!</li>
    <li> It took a bit of getting used to just to operate this device - how to hold the syringe during use, how to hold my head, and so forth, but once I became accustomed to it I use it without effort and it effectively washes food chunks from crevasses around my teeth.</li>
    <li> Eliminates all the excess gadgetry of powered irrigating systems.  Easy to clean.  Just a little awkward.  A &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; version might be more effective than using a plunger.</li>
    <li> Get this if you have tonsil stones and are sick of bad breath.</li>
    <li> This product did meet my needs. The only thing I wish was,  a  thinner  tip. I need a smaller (more like a needle thin end) to get up in the gum and tooth area. But all in all it did what I needed and did what you advertised.</li>
    <li> Good product to have if you suffer with tonsil stones from time to time.  It&#x27;s safer to use tha getting your tonsils removed.</li>
    <li> Great product for those, like me, who might have a tooth or three which naturally fell out and food gets caught in the tooth socket- this lil baby is like a manual waterpick when you are away or at work to keep those sockets cleaned out (wisdom teeth also) - dab some clove oil around it after rinsing, rinse with water, no problems (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad I could find this little device, had one back 25 years ago when I had my wisdom teeth pulled, without it, I ended up with dry socket which is what happens when food gets caught and rots in a tooth socket - basically an infection (clove oil kills 63 bacteria types) I also rinse with Baking soda to neutralize mouth acid too.  not advice here!!- this is just what I do and works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for offing these at a great price, dentist prolly charges 25.00 for one... greedy bastages.....</li>
    <li> As described. It works great for my periodontal irrigating care.</li>
    <li> Ezy Care Dental irrigating Syringe works as advertised.  It is good for hard to reach places, esp areas unreachable with floss.  Years ago, after wisdom tooth extraction, my dentist gave me one of these to rinse under the stitches.  I now have some areas that are too tight for the floss, and this syringe works great.  Lot cheaper than a waterpik!   Rinse at gum line, and between teeth.</li>
    <li> This little tool was really helpful when I got my wisdom teeth and tonsils out. You can flood the area gently with water to clean out small spaces where floss and picks won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this dental irrigating syringe because, I was suffering with those nasty irritating tonsil stones... I was looking for a quick fix, when I stumbled across reviews from different customers about this product... People were raving about how good this product worked. Well, it made have worked for them, but it did nothing for me... It didn&#x27;t even remove the food from between my teeth. What a waste of money...</li>
    <li> It squirts water like a champ.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a good product for irrigating tonsil stones. It works as a water pik too so you can use it on your gums also. Allows you to control the pressure, unlike electrical water piks.</li>
    <li> works like a water pic but portable</li>
    <li> Came quick and exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Works very well for cleaning in between teeth.</li>
    <li> After the simultaneous removal of both my wisdom teeth, little pockets were created in my gums. If I didn&#x27;t wash the food out of those pockets daily, the food would collect in those pockets and would remain partially digested and foul-smelling/tasting. This syringe is ideal for flushing the food out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- syringe is easy to fill and held its seal while I used it for about 2-3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;- the long curved end allows the syringe tip to be positioned close to the pockets to wash food away&lt;br /&gt;- water stream pressure from the syringe is not too high so it did not hurt my post-surgery sensitive gums&lt;br /&gt;- did not find a syringe like this at my local Walmart or CVS (medication dispensing syringes are available, but do not have the advantages listed above)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for oral irrigation after wisdom tooth removal.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to see if it would help me with my tonsil stones.  Awesome product to clear them out effectively.  This Works perfectly!</li>
    <li> does what i need it to do, good deal, thanks alot and now for a few more words so I can post this.</li>
    <li> I use this plastic syringe with warm water to gently rinse out &amp;#34;tonsil stones&amp;#34; (condensed balls of plaque) from crevices in the back of my throat that feels like small lumps and cause bad breath.</li>
    <li> I am college student with no dental insurance and I have an abscessed wisdom tooth. This was purchased to irrigate plaque away from the problem area.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase it&#x27;s very effective and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> I havent tried the product yet but this was recommended to me for around dental work and I could not find it at any local pharmacy so Im glad I found it here. Shipping was way overpriced though.</li>
    <li> Plastic syringe that works and can be reused many times. Perfect for oral higiene. Nothing fancy or innovative, just exactly what you need</li>
    <li> Very pleased . Will def order more when I need them</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for irrigating deep gum pockets without carrying an array of appliances when traveling.</li>
    <li> You might never guess that this device would be used in a pottery studio for extruding clay onto surfaces evenly..it works well for that.</li>
    <li> This Ezy Care Dental Irrigating Syringe is so easy to use and it really works well! This high quality Ezy Care Dental Irrigating Syringe I have found so helpful for my dental health that I recommend this to you for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Easy to fill and clean and LEAK FREE - So I filled this up to the top and was able to use a single fill-up on my top and bottom gum areas without having to stop and refill again.&lt;br /&gt;* To clean it I just placed both pieces of this under a stream of very hot water and fully dried and put it back together.&lt;br /&gt;And I am using the package that it came with as a kind of travel case (I rubber band tightly the case to keep it as airtight as possible).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Cleaning Ability - For this not being an actual pulsating water pik type of device, I was still surprised at how well it cleaned my gums, teeth etc. In fact after using this, my gums feel great and look better and are responding to this very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Ease of use around the gum line - Here is a tip - be sure you place your head slightly down when you do this and aim it directly on the gum-line. This way it will not spray water all over bathroom mirror (This happened to me the first time I used this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Portability and Travel Use - Since I keep this in the package that it came with (rubber-banded tightly) this fits into my travel bag easily and stays dry and ready to use. Best part is that NO ELECTRICITY is required, no charging etc!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: This is more of a portable device for on the go or just for quick use. However, it cleans my gums and gum-line better than I expected it to clean! For this price and quality, what an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to all!</li>
    <li> The same syringe an oral surgeon gave me years ago after an extraction.  A gentle way to keep the socket clean after a tooth extraction.  The curved tip makes all the difference.  For some reason you cannot find this syringe on the shelves of any pharmacy in my area, I searched everywhere.  Order one before your next extraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could also be used as a water pick when travelling.</li>
    <li> This is great for cleaning cryptic tonsils.  Larger than most syringes for this purpose, with a curved tip for hard to reach places.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Works great on my tonsil.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Small enough for a purse or pocket.  Helps me rinse out a problem crown after eating.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Had my wisdom teeth removed a few weeks ago and this syringe is a must for keeping the area clean!  Make sure you wait at least a week for the area to heal to avoid dry socket.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use.  Once tip was properly place around gum area, it was really difficult to press plunger without the tip moving out of position.  Useless to me.</li>
