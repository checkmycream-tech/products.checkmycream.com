<ol>
      <li>Great Sleep Mask!!!!   </li>
      <li>but it turns out to be one of the best night mask I have used.</li>
      <li>These masks are the best!</li>
      <li>Excellent blackout, and therefore enhanced sleep.</li>
      <li>Perfect amount of cushion.</li>
      <li>These are very pleasant masks.  </li>
      <li>For some reason, these just aren&#x27;t as good!</li>
      <li>Great sleep mask...</li>
      <li>The Dream Zone sleep mask is a very nice product.</li>
      <li>These Christmas lights on my house are bright</li>
      <li>The elastic wears over time but this is one of the good ones</li>
      <li>Nice product at a great price</li>
      <li>good quality.  </li>
      <li>these r nice and have velcrow adjustments for looser or tighter fit good price too ez to hand wash</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every sleep mask on the planet and these are by far the best.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
      <li>Very comfortable, barley know it is on.</li>
      <li>Nice, works well, but has a strong chemical smell.</li>
      <li>Love this mask, so when the elastic started to go (after 5 years)</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>These masks are incredible, I couldn&#x27;t even tell when I was wearing one, because the smoothness of the silk and the professional sowing of the mask and connecting band.</li>
      <li>The one I had was comfortable and not too warm.</li>
      <li>That said, I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
      <li>My favorite sleep mask.</li>
      <li>Love these...</li>
      <li>Very glad I made this investment instead of buying huge curtains that probably wouldn&#x27;t block out light either.</li>
      <li>For the price, I think 6-8 months is pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is soft, comfortable and does a great job of keeping light out.</li>
      <li>the size covers my face and keeps the morning light out.</li>
      <li>and some didn&#x27;t fit well at all.  </li>
      <li>Now, if I can only find some ear plugs I will be a happy camper.  </li>
      <li>These masks come in at a great price and will probably last you 6-8 months before the cushioning in the mask part flattens out.</li>
      <li>I give these out as gifts and only hear great feedback</li>
      <li>blocks out light esp.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cannot live without this product as it is super comfortable and allows me to get a good nights rest.  </li>
      <li>Not a big deal but a better strap would be nice.</li>
      <li>so I can always have a clean one.</li>
      <li>These are much softer with a wider adjustable band and were very comfortable to use even on my side.  </li>
      <li>At least the sleep mask works great!</li>
      <li>I rarely do it and when I do, the mask needs to be 100% irritation free.</li>
      <li>Comfortable and very helpful while sleeping in a lighted area.</li>
      <li>Anyways I bought these and they completely block out the light and gently cover my eyes, and even better it warms me up for Christmas time...  </li>
      <li>With this, I am like a parrot when the cage is covered: I drop right off to sleep.</li>
      <li>Bonus is that when I put it on, my body immediately gets more tired and I fall asleep more easily - Pavlov&#x27;s dog, anyone?</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t fit very well or block out enough light.</li>
      <li>No, my hair does not get caught in it as was my first thought when I opened the package.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s to be expected, but the sleep masks should  be washed in Luke warm water.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many of these, and they&#x27;ve all been the same.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very particular about wearing mask at night.  </li>
      <li>large rubber band</li>
      <li>I really miss it.</li>
      <li>I have only used the cheap ones that they give you on airplanes.  </li>
      <li>I really hope I can find one in the store again.</li>
      <li>I use them on airplanes, road trips, and during the summer when it gets light far too early.</li>
      <li>I am down to one mask and I will order more.</li>
      <li>These are very plush and soft, which is why I like them so much.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I recommend these to everyone and they have ordered them with high praises.</li>
      <li>I bought this because of the cute little moon and stars design  </li>
      <li>I have a very bright room and even during the night, light from street lamps seep in through my Benny blinds into my room, it was very annoying especially since I love to sleep in complete darkness.  </li>
      <li>Soft, large and natural materials</li>
      <li>Very soft durable fabric.  </li>
      <li>The material is soft and satiny, but the mask itself seems overfilled with the polyester filling and therefore is very warm and presses on my eyes uncomfortably.</li>
      <li>I bought these several years ago, and since then I have tried many other varieties.</li>
      <li>I had previously purchased this brand/style in a store and really liked it, but sadly left it on a plane recently.</li>
      <li>Little padded cups under the eyes to keep light out.</li>
      <li>Some were very thin and let light in and some tore easily</li>
      <li>I was excited to find these online for less than Ulta.</li>
      <li>Both the Mrs. and I have a lot of trouble sleeping, be it the pets bothering us or the early morning light.</li>
      <li>they completely block them out.</li>
      <li>Soft and padded.</li>
      <li>BUT these are thick (no light), comfortable, fit well, and are well constructed.  </li>
      <li>These also are all slightly different shapes and clearly are of poorer quality.</li>

    <li> Highly recommended. I recommend these to everyone and they have ordered them with high praises. I am down to one mask and I will order more. Love them.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the cute little moon and stars design  but it turns out to be one of the best night mask I have used. I have tried other masks but prefer this one and would buy it again. It is larger and thicker without being bulky. the size covers my face and keeps the morning light out. it also has an adjustable strap that closes with velcro. No, my hair does not get caught in it as was my first thought when I opened the package. I got one for my sister and she feels the same. Nice product at a great price</li>
    <li> I keep 3 of these so I can always have a clean one. They work well. Bonus is that when I put it on, my body immediately gets more tired and I fall asleep more easily - Pavlov&#x27;s dog, anyone?</li>
    <li> blocks out light esp. for me as I work nights!!! sun thru window crack keeps me awake!! these r nice and have velcrow adjustments for looser or tighter fit good price too ez to hand wash/dry</li>
    <li> Love this mask, so when the elastic started to go (after 5 years) I was excited to find these online for less than Ulta. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Both the Mrs. and I have a lot of trouble sleeping, be it the pets bothering us or the early morning light. These masks come in at a great price and will probably last you 6-8 months before the cushioning in the mask part flattens out. For the price, I think 6-8 months is pretty good. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying again when these ones wear flat.</li>
    <li> I have only used the cheap ones that they give you on airplanes.  These are much softer with a wider adjustable band and were very comfortable to use even on my side.  We rented a house for a month and the bedroom had no shades, these did the trick.  I&#x27;m going to put it in my travel bag and use it when ever I travel.  Very soft durable fabric.  I reccomend!</li>
    <li> Love these... I work nights and rely on a dark room for daytime sleep.  I&#x27;ve tried every sleep mask on the planet and these are by far the best.  Perfect amount of cushion.</li>
    <li> You get three, so you are nevr without it. Excellent blackout, and therefore enhanced sleep. Soft, large and natural materials</li>
    <li> As always, when wrapped in plastic the sleep masks have a peculiar and unpleasant odor. That&#x27;s to be expected, but the sleep masks should  be washed in Luke warm water. They should just be squeezed dry with a towel and then left to air dry naturally. On these really cold nights they provide warmth as well as providing darkness when the sun comes up. I use sleep masks during the day if I want to take a nap.</li>
    <li> I have a very bright room and even during the night, light from street lamps seep in through my Benny blinds into my room, it was very annoying especially since I love to sleep in complete darkness.  Anyways I bought these and they completely block out the light and gently cover my eyes, and even better it warms me up for Christmas time...  These Christmas lights on my house are bright they completely block them out. Very glad I made this investment instead of buying huge curtains that probably wouldn&#x27;t block out light either.</li>
    <li> Comfortable and very helpful while sleeping in a lighted area. I use them on airplanes, road trips, and during the summer when it gets light far too early. With this, I am like a parrot when the cage is covered: I drop right off to sleep. I just wish I didn&#x27;t lose them - I am on my third set.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable.  It beats buying window treatments.  Also used to keep my eyes moist when I sleep.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very particular about wearing mask at night.  I rarely do it and when I do, the mask needs to be 100% irritation free. These masks are incredible, I couldn&#x27;t even tell when I was wearing one, because the smoothness of the silk and the professional sowing of the mask and connecting band.</li>
    <li> Great Sleep Mask!!!!   I&#x27;ve tried 3 different masks.  Some were very thin and let light in and some tore easily and some didn&#x27;t fit well at all.  BUT these are thick (no light), comfortable, fit well, and are well constructed.  Now, if I can only find some ear plugs I will be a happy camper.  PS I tried custom made ear plugs and they are so uncomfortable and they get hard after awhile.  At least the sleep mask works great!</li>
    <li> The Dream Zone sleep mask is a very nice product. It is soft, comfortable and does a great job of keeping light out. The only reason I rated it with 4 stars is the elastic strap stretches out of shape. When I reach the end of the Velcro adjustment I start tying knots in the strap to make it smaller. Not a big deal but a better strap would be nice. I still recommend this mask for it&#x27;s comfort.</li>
    <li> Nice, works well, but has a strong chemical smell.</li>
    <li> I have major sleeping issues/ insomnia and every mask i have tried keeps me up because they are uncomfortable (whether too big, too opaque, fabric attracts dust or just plain uncomfortable)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot live without this product as it is super comfortable and allows me to get a good nights rest.  Had to get a pair for my sister and husband because they kept trying to steal mine.  I give these out as gifts and only hear great feedback</li>
    <li> I bought these several years ago, and since then I have tried many other varieties. I just bought a 3-pack of this brand again this month because none of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried meet my needs. These are very plush and soft, which is why I like them so much. They don&#x27;t leave a mark on my face like others.</li>
    <li> The elastic wears over time but this is one of the good ones</li>
    <li> Horrible strap broke first night large rubber band like strap very uncomfortable felt thick and bulky</li>
    <li> These are very pleasant masks.  The only problem is that the strap quickly becomes loose, making it hard to keep the mask on.  I&#x27;ve used many of these, and they&#x27;ve all been the same.  That said, I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
    <li> These masks are the best! My wife has been using them for years and now I can see why. Very comfortable, barley know it is on.</li>
    <li> Usually I don&#x27;t like to sleep with sleep masks because they are not comfortable, but this one is really comfortable and soft, now I&#x27;m using it everyday to sleep.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t fit very well or block out enough light. I had previously purchased this brand/style in a store and really liked it, but sadly left it on a plane recently. For some reason, these just aren&#x27;t as good! I think they are knockoffs! The material is soft and satiny, but the mask itself seems overfilled with the polyester filling and therefore is very warm and presses on my eyes uncomfortably. I am really disappointed and wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted so much money on buying 3 of these. I really hope I can find one in the store again. I really miss it. The one I had was comfortable and not too warm. These also are all slightly different shapes and clearly are of poorer quality. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> Great sleep mask...good quality.  Lets you sleep in the middle of the day in a well lit room.</li>
    <li> My favorite sleep mask. Soft and padded. Little padded cups under the eyes to keep light out. My only complaint is that the elastic stretches out too wide after a while.</li>
