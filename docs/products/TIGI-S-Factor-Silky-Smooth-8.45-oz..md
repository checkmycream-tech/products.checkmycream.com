      <li>This product smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>It is a fine product but it does not reach up to my expectation.  </li>
      <li>TIGI&#x27;s S Factor Silky Smooth Moisture Serum is light, easy to apply, and helps to control frizz while leaving hair shiny.  </li>
      <li>It leave my hair feeling smooth and shinny.</li>
      <li>This helps keep your hair smooth and smelling fantastic.</li>
      <li>I thought it would give prompt silky smooth.</li>

      <li>Well worth it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great product and it lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products promising frizz free hair</li>

      <li>It maeks it exactly what the name is Silky and Smooth.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t help detangle at all, but after you style your hair, it&#x27;s very shiny and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I used this product for the first time and it was so so for me.</li>
      <li>I thought that it would add moisture back to me hair over a period of time making it more manageable</li>
      <li>I also then bought the S-Factor shampoo/conditioner in this same line and love that, too.  </li>

      <li>The shipment came fast too!</li>
      <li>And if it does curl up, I can pretty much run my fingers through it</li>
      <li>Okay... so I&#x27;ve been trying every straightening product since my &#x27;normal&#x27; hair became pretty curly/wavy and hard-to-style last year.  </li>
      <li>A good moisture serum, though not sure I would buy again.  </li>
      <li>and I love the silky feel of my hair after I blow dry it...and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best leave in conditioner which is great on adding moisture to hair that&#x27;s frequently washed and in the sun.  I love the smell of this product.  The price on Amazon is half of retail cost.  This product came well packaged and intact without any leakage.  Hope Amazon continues to stock this.</li>
    <li> my wife uses this continously--I need to buy stock in the company</li>
    <li> It is a fine product but it does not reach up to my expectation.  I thought it would give prompt silky smooth. Yes, it is. But for a while.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I love everything about it. The shipment came fast too!</li>
    <li> This is only ok. I say that because the other one they make in the tube works way better. Same brand but thicker formula</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! It smells great, and a little goes a long way. I have thick, curly hair with a touch of frizz (due to my lovely bi-racial race:0). I have tried many products promising frizz free hair but none have succeeded. A good friend of mine suggested this haircare line and I am grateful for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a tip to fellow users, i suggest using on freshly washed hair (using the S Factor shampoo and conditioner as well, which are equally wonderful!), that is slightly damp. Part down the middle and apply 1-2 pumps depending on length of hair. I use two for each section because of my length of hair. I comb it through and then let it dry naturally, and TaDa! Lovely curls that are lustrous and bouncy. I have received many compliments about the look and smell of my hair. All ladies of ethnicity, please try this line! Well worth it!</li>
    <li> I have big, curly, frizzy hair and am always looking for new products.  This one is a keeper.   It is a silky lotion, smells great, makes my hair shinny and is not sticky.  A little goes a long way and can also be put on your hair when it is dry.   I love it!</li>
    <li> I needed something to help my hair beat the summer heat and this product works great. I was tired of having the fried hair look and now it looks so much better! This serum provides moisture that is light weight and smells great. Not like those oily feeling serums, so much better. Just a dime size drop does the trick so the bottle should last for months. I highly recommend this product to those looking to boost their hair without the heavy buildup, which should be everyone.</li>
    <li> All TiGi products are good.   However, having naturally curly, coarse hair I have found this moisture serum to deliver what it promises on the label.  Great for frizz!   Makes my hair soft also.   Great product.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> TIGI S-Factor silky smooth smells wonderful but it leaves my hair dry and  I normally have lots of moisture in my hair!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but for the price and brand it is really disappointing. it will smooth your hair somewhat but also will dry it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to combat frizz in my thick, naturally curly hair.  It&#x27;s a great product and it lasts a long time.  Amazon&#x27;s price is the best by far.</li>
    <li> watch for expiration date,i did not notice the expiration date at the bottom of the product,i just realized it  expired since April 2011 and i purchased it in June 2011,i use it for 7 months and i saw the expiration in February 2012.Unfortunately, it was way too late to return the product so the point is i have been using an expired serum in my hair for a very long time. Very dissapointed at Amazon.</li>
    <li> It did not worked for my hair at all. It made my hair dull and hard, maybe it wasn&#x27;t for my kind of hair, but the times I used it, my hair was always hard to handle.</li>
    <li> I have used this \\&quot;serum\\&quot; since S Factor was announced...my friend was a rep for TiGi.....The key is to use a LITTLE...I have very fine, thin hair and I love the silky feel of my hair after I blow dry it...and the smell.....I use Ovation for my shampoo etc but finish with a \\&quot;little\\&quot; of this serum....it is NOT sticky -?</li>
    <li> This product smells pretty good. However it seems to make my hair sticky in a way. Ill put it on before I blow dry my hair and my hair sticks to my fingers and doesnt brush through to good. It almost like I have moose in my hair. It seems to tangle my hair more. Its probably good for others though. Just not what I imagined. I really like the defrizzer and tamer from s factor. Works way better for my needs :)</li>
    <li> This product is excellant and priced well. Will continue to purchase this item. Great fast service. Thank you</li>
    <li> TIGI&#x27;s S Factor Silky Smooth Moisture Serum is light, easy to apply, and helps to control frizz while leaving hair shiny.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I have tried product after product to unfrizz my hair.  Most products require you to put it on wet/damp hair.  This you can use on wet or dry hair.  The serum has just the right amount of oil that it anti-frizzes your hair without leaving it greasy so I can use my flat iron on it.  It makes my hair very smooth.  When I put it on wet/damp hair and blow dry, I usually don&#x27;t even need to use the flat iron except in a couple of places.  Great product!</li>
    <li> It smells amazing and makes my hair look so healthy. I have long hair so split ends are in the past. This helps keep your hair smooth and smelling fantastic.</li>
    <li> Great product. Makes your hair healthy and shinny!  Love the product. Had my salon order it for me. Makes hair very soft and managable.</li>
    <li> Okay... so I&#x27;ve been trying every straightening product since my &#x27;normal&#x27; hair became pretty curly/wavy and hard-to-style last year.  It gets kinky/curly/frizzy if I even think about sweat, rain or humidity!  Nothing worked &#x27;that&#x27; well.  Then I tried this!  It smells great, makes my hair dry straight with much less effort (I use a large round brush and a blow dryer-- even with my short hair, but not can skip my flat iron), and amazingly, even on a second day, my hair still smells fresh, acts fresh (with a little dry shampoo spray) and barely gets it&#x27;s normal humidity frizz/curl.  And if it does curl up, I can pretty much run my fingers through it and it&#x27;s relatively straight again.  It almost gets static electricity- but it doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed a product could make this much difference until I read the reviews on this on... and tried it!  I also then bought the S-Factor shampoo/conditioner in this same line and love that, too.  I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell this works at all.  And when I received the product, it smelled old as if it had sat on a shelf for years.</li>
    <li> works great to keep flyaway hair smooth; cruelty free!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product  for over a year and really like how it makes my hair feel.  Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> It was leaking in box when it arrived.  The serum is different then what I had in my last bottle.  I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula but I don&#x27;t care for this scent and consistency. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it from amazon again.  Arrived as promised which was the only good part of the transaction.</li>
    <li> I was previously using the Dove absolute curl crème serum to keep my curls moisturized, but I&#x27;ve used S Factor products in previous yrs so I thought I&#x27;d give this serum a try. It is the BEST product I have used to keep my curls frizz free!!! It smells so good! And my hair is super duper shiny!!! This completes my curl routine!! I use ogx nourishing coconut shampoo and conditioner. I next use mixed chicks leaves in conditioner and finally S factor silky smooth serum.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I run it through my hair prior to drying. It leave my hair feeling smooth and shinny.</li>
    <li> Best smoothing serum on the market. Love S Factor</li>
    <li> Good price, respond on my expectation, easy to get it, easy to use, I recommend is a good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> I Love! Love!! Love!!! this product!! Eliminates frizz and dullness....adds shine and lots of health to dry or unmanageable hair!</li>
    <li> So I bought this a my local Publix (grocery store) and it was 20 dollars. I&#x27;ve had it for about 4 months and havent even use 1/4th of the bottle yet! I don&#x27;t use it all the time though. This is S Factors \\&quot;blow-dry\\&quot; type lotion for medium to thin hair as the consitency isn&#x27;t as thick as Smoothing Lusterizer which is there blow-dry lotion for medium to thick hair, which I have as well (also great product!). It makes my hair straighter than when I don&#x27;t use blow-dry lotion. It maeks it exactly what the name is Silky and Smooth. So amazing. I&#x27;ll be sure to buy this product gain! :D</li>
    <li> * A good moisture serum, though not sure I would buy again.  * I like the pump and consistency but I guess I was expecting more from this product.  * I like the Fructis Brand, so many ones to try!</li>
    <li> I have very dry and frizzy hair and this product does wonders! I put this on after I wash my hair when it&#x27;s damp and either blow dry it after or just let it air dry. It makes my hair smell great too!</li>
    <li> Great for kinky curly hair extensions!!</li>
    <li> surprisingly disappointed. Ive always been a fan of these products (mostly their heat protectants and shine sprays) but this leave in product made my hair sticky and difficult to style.</li>
    <li> I bought this instead of the &amp;#34;Smoothing Lusterizer&amp;#34; just to try it out and it&#x27;s great!  It doesn&#x27;t help detangle at all, but after you style your hair, it&#x27;s very shiny and smooth.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Just need a pea size dab to work through hair. Works great as a detangler for my long, fragile, high lift blonde hair. Leaves my hair very managable.  Don&#x27;t use tto much or it will make your hair feel weighted down!</li>
    <li> May be it is just my hair (medium-thick, soft), but it works pretty bad. It is sticky as hell and sometimes I even feel some sections of my hair become stiff. Total waste of money :(</li>
    <li> Been using this moisture serum for a couple of years. Not sure what I would do without it as my hair tend to dryness and it is very fine. Most moisturzers weigh it down so much I end up with flat hair and stringy bangs. Not with this serum. It is the perfect balance for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over the past few weeks, and I have to say... I&#x27;m not impressed at all. It smells nice, but it&#x27;s really watery, and I&#x27;m not sure it does anything for my hair... I think it might be a knock off. Sadly, I would not recommend buying this from amazon. I would rather pay a little more to my hair dresser and know I&#x27;m getting the real thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best leave in conditioner that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;It works great when I straighten my hair or when I&lt;br /&gt;scrunch it curly.</li>
    <li> This product helps keep my curly hair under control! I use this and hair gel and my curls look fabulous!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and it was so so for me. I thought that it would add moisture back to me hair over a period of time making it more manageable but it doesn&#x27;t. But what I will say is while it is freshly applied and still damp on my hair it does feel silky smooth and somewhat easy to manage, but when it dries you never even knew you ever had the product in your hair.</li>
    <li> Smells really good. Definitely helps tame the frizz but doesn&#x27;t really make my hair any softer. Probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The texture, the smell, the effect. I have a wavy long hair. This product is not good for the entire hair body but it works wonders in the ends and also in combination with other products. I would definitely buy it again abut knowing that it is for the ends only.</li>
    <li> Have used this for years and love it!</li>
    <li> I color my hair several times and year, with highlights... And my hair was fried!!! (ps im a swimmer too)&lt;br /&gt;And I have been using this product since 2008... I have treeless others like it when I run out or can&#x27;t find this product.:. And they do not even come close to comparing!!&lt;br /&gt;Normally my hair has to be washed 1/2 as much (every other day) when I use this with my straightener...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Good products, I was able to buy cheaply.&lt;br /&gt;But I think you need to pay attention to the date of manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;I could not understand the numbers at the bottom of the date of manufacture or expiry date whether.</li>
    <li> I love these products and the prices.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used on my hair with no greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair smooth and manageable and you only need a little bit (so it lasts a very long time)</li>
    <li> This product smells great and works very well. It is not dense and it&#x27;s perfect for fine hairs. I use to buy After party (pink bottle). Both are great, I don&#x27;t know with one works better.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It does what 3 products normally I would need. The smell is very pleasant and does not make my hair tacky or sticky.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference In my hair after using this except for the smell which Is very nice, has a strawberry banana smell to it I liked that the best,</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little thick when it comes out, but it is brilliant when it goes on!  My hair has never looked better - and I&#x27;ve used several other professional brands of serum.</li>
    <li> Absolutely  amazing. I have long thick coarse hair that is naturally curly.  I can use this on wet or dry hair with amazing results! I often straighten my hair and it always looks like I just left the salon.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair static-y but i love the shine it adds.</li>
    <li> this product smells good and leaves hair soft and shiny, silky but has a bad after smell but does the job.</li>
    <li> This is definitely a keeper, I&#x27;ve searched and searched for something to help me with my thick, frizzy, and unmanageable hair and I FOUND IT!</li>
