<li> but thats normal although i thought they arrived pretty earlyish for something that came late if u get what i mean.</li>
<li> They are all packaged in individual sterilized packages, and they are extremely sharp, and the tips are longer so it makes it easier when piercing.</li>
<li> Pretty annoyed.</li>
<li> arrived a little later than it said it would</li>
<li> I use a jeweler&#x27;s loupe to inspect tips for burrs which can cause unnecessary trauma or tearing damage to skin during a new piercing.</li>
<li> they are sharp as well!</li>
<li> Product was on time and here within date but the packaging was horrible my package was open they could of fell out other than that love it</li>
<li> Needles seem very sharp.</li>
<li> I ordered these and stamped into the casing was a medium black hair.</li>
<li> Not one complaint from anyone</li>
<li> Wrong size , sent me 16g</li>
<li> It made piercing my industrials as painless as can be when you&#x27;re stabbing a part of your body.</li>

    <li> I still have no idea why i ordered so many. They&#x27;re super awesome, they&#x27;re packaged really well and they&#x27;re exactly like piercing needles should be.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t deliver. I&#x27;ve used these needles before and they&#x27;re very good, the needles are sharp and sterile, but this time they never showed up. Pretty annoyed.</li>
    <li> this is a very good product. i love it, everything was how it should be. well packed and in order</li>
    <li> Great product and great customer service!</li>
    <li> I ordered these and stamped into the casing was a medium black hair. That isn&#x27;t sterile. Considering contacting seller about that</li>
    <li> These are just what they say they are. Needles seem very sharp. Pierced my cartilage twice using these and worked great.</li>
    <li> Your basic 14 gauge piercing needle. no flaws. these will be the needles I buy from now on. Great price, no flaws, just as described, super fast shipping. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I am a body piercing apprentice and these needles certainly aren&#x27;t as sharp as I&#x27;m used to dealing with, but they still get the job done.</li>
    <li> Good quality needles, arrived on time, simple packaging. I love it! Thanks guys!</li>
    <li> I got my package rather fast. I was really surprised actually. I don&#x27;t know why I needed a hundred needles, but who can argue with the price? They are very sharp and good quality needles. It made piercing my industrials as painless as can be when you&#x27;re stabbing a part of your body. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Product was on time and here within date but the packaging was horrible my package was open they could of fell out other than that love it</li>
    <li> The needle lengths are waaaaaaaay to short for my personal tastes. I would prefer something with a little more room to push with considering the common size of this gauge and the various areas of the body/tissue thickness that can thus be pierced with this size for the short shaft it provides.</li>
    <li> The product was just what I needed.  They were the right size and seemed to go in smoothly when doing a piercing.  Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Not so. Great but gets the job done but he packs in the pictures arnt what they look like. But oh well there allright</li>
    <li> These are great, they work perfect :)</li>
    <li> Wrong size , sent me 16g</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to pierce and ear, they work great. Don&#x27;t use a safety pin to pierce. Made that mistake before, so I bought these and they create a nice hole.</li>
    <li> Good Quality it came with all the needles and it came pretty fast</li>
    <li> these are a great deal, and arrived in individual sterile packages, I bought them for my sons friend to pierce my ears during her apprenticeship and there were tons leftover to help her as new business came her way!</li>

    <li> I bought these for my son who has been doing piercings for over a year now. He told me to give these a 5-star review because they work well in the piercing procedure.</li>
    <li> Work perfectly. Be aware that these are imported, so quality may vary from one needle to the next. I use a jeweler&#x27;s loupe to inspect tips for burrs which can cause unnecessary trauma or tearing damage to skin during a new piercing. K-Y helps them glide through clean.</li>
    <li> I got the needles on time and was very pleased with the packaging. I also loved how each needle was individually packaged and sterilized.
