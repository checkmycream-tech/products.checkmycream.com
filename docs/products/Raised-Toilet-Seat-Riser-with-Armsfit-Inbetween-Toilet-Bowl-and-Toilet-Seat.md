      <li>A perfect substitute for a bulky chair.</li>
      <li>Exceptional price, too!</li>
      <li>It is a great help to her.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how great this riser is.</li>
      <li>Would be good if there were two or three heights to choose from.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a perfectly good product.  </li>
      <li>With no place for grab bars in my bathroom, this seat proved easy to install, not terribly bulky and the perfect support I needed after knee replacement.  </li>
      <li>Nice decor as well.</li>
      <li>I may even put one in my own home since it helps me with my arthritic knees.</li>
      <li>The best thing is we could put a padded seat on top to make it more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Great product exactly as described by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>But REALLY glad I bought this item.</li>
      <li>Anyway, what I did find to be a better solution for my mom</li>
      <li>An excellent aid for those who need elevation and support following hip replacement.</li>
      <li>Got this after a knee replacement and love the effortless lift.</li>
      <li>We like this one much better.</li>

      <li>Sturdy and easy to install.  </li>
      <li>The instructions were easy to follow and was easily installed.</li>
      <li>Easy to install.  </li>
      <li>She is in good health, but just old.  </li>
      <li>and there&#x27;s no way to clean that without removing it.</li>
      <li>My wife says it is much better and because I put a soft seat on top</li>
      <li>This product is a good visual design idea, but it is not well engineered.  </li>
      <li>this item is for regular toilets, and looks of good quality.</li>
      <li>Not bad looking either.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast and seat was easy to install.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very sturdy and so easy to install.</li>
      <li>Easy to install and very sturdy.  </li>
      <li>This product was EXACTLY  what I needed!  </li>
      <li>Also, actual height that it raises the seat is more like 3 1/2 inches, not 5 which is fine.</li>
      <li>Although she is incontinent, I was sure that she would be able to use a toilet if the seat was higher.</li>
      <li>If I was any larger, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit.  </li>
      <li>As good as it gets and far better than the three  other kinds we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This design is reasonably comfortable and useful, but after a while I realized that gunk was building up between the bottom of it and the top of the toilet bowl.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what we wanted.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Might be OK on an elongated seat, or if the user isn&#x27;t male.</li>
      <li>When used, however, urine can get between the product and the top of the toilet bowl</li>
      <li>Also, this toilet seat is for regular-sized toilets, not elongated toilets (which I have), so it doesn&#x27;t fit exactly right, but it still works..</li>
      <li>It is solid, well constructed, easy to put on and inexpensive.  </li>
      <li>For her, pressing upon the side handles works very well.</li>
      <li>#5, there is no \\&quot;lip\\&quot; at the back end of the riser to fit partly inside the bowl and protect the riser&#x27;s underside from splashings (as would happen with diarrhea).    </li>
      <li>They are really for the shorter bowls.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>mom found the handles helped her get up from the bowl much</li>
      <li>Bought this to replace a raised seat that was several years old and would no longer lock safely.  </li>
      <li>My wife snapped her tibia and fibula bones right above her right ankle and the breaks were repaired in surgery with screws and plates.  </li>
      <li>The handles work better for sitting down than standing up</li>
      <li>Rock steady in use.  </li>
      <li>just wish they were a little longer to fit better on a long bowl.  </li>
      <li>Five would have been too high.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>so it can be REALLY high, just as my mom needed it.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled with how this product looked, and ignored the negative reviews.</li>
      <li>Since you put the regular toilet seat on top, my mother could barely tell it was there.</li>
      <li>I am not a small person by any means</li>
      <li>We originally had  one you couldn&#x27;t use a regular toilet seat with.</li>
      <li>Additional information they gave me: The top of the arms are four and a half inches above the top of the seat, and the overall width of the item is twenty-one and a half inches.</li>
      <li>However, I am a women&#x27;s size 12/14 and it is a tight fit between the handles for me.  </li>
      <li>Just remove the toilet seat you are currently using, place the riser on the bowl and place your exhisiting seat on top, insert the long screws and washers provided and that is it!  </li>
      <li>This riser made it so much easier for her especially with the handles offering support and favorable leverage and now she requires no assistance.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 of these risers for myself and my 86 year old mom.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this raised seat with arms to hopefully solve the issue, but found it not quite high enough</li>
      <li>and if the person using it is overweight with larger hips, it will be a tight fit.</li>
      <li>The only problem: I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and my mother is 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and this raises the toilet seat too high for both of us.  </li>
      <li>was a commode with the bucket removed and placed directly over a toilet.</li>
      <li>#3, the large wing nuts that screw onto the bolts from underneath are too large to pass through the crevices behind the bowl&#x27;s seat and cannot actually be completely tightened against the surface;  </li>
      <li>it just fits a little funny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not wide enough for a somewhat overweight person.  </li>
      <li>and I still really struggled to get her to bend down enough to sit on it.</li>

<li> #2, the bolts are round but the openings at the back through which they&#x27;re inserted are wide and oblong-shaped, which means that the bolts are not encased by and held tight within the plastic -- and because the bolts are round but the bolt openings are not, the riser (and the toilet seat) moves out of position with day-to-day usage;  </li>
<li> The side handles are too small, too low, and located too far back, and are awkward and uncomfortable for a 5&#x27;2\\&quot; senior with shoulder problems to use comfortably for standing up.  </li>
<li> However toilets come in at least two types, the regular bowl and the elongated bowl.</li>
<li> If you have mobility issues, I would recomend having someone who can bend down with ease tighten up the screws/washers.    </li>

<li> The handles on the side are appropiately placed for an assistance in getting up and sitting down.    </li>
<li> The product arrived at the door less than 24 hours after ordering.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sturdy.  Rock steady in use.  Inexpensive.  Easy to install.  As good as it gets and far better than the three  other kinds we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I read the comments about this item before placing my order, and after using it for 3 weeks took if off the bowl. (I purchased it in 2009 for my elderly mother who needs to support herself when sitting down and rising from a seat.)  This product is a good visual design idea, but it is not well engineered.  #1, there is nothing at the bottom of the seat to stick to the porcelain edge of the bowl and hold it in place (there are 3 pieces of black tape but they don&#x27;t grip);  #2, the bolts are round but the openings at the back through which they&#x27;re inserted are wide and oblong-shaped, which means that the bolts are not encased by and held tight within the plastic -- and because the bolts are round but the bolt openings are not, the riser (and the toilet seat) moves out of position with day-to-day usage;  #3, the large wing nuts that screw onto the bolts from underneath are too large to pass through the crevices behind the bowl&#x27;s seat and cannot actually be completely tightened against the surface;  #4, after I tightened the bolts as much as possible, the front of the riser lifted slightly off the edge and stayed that way;  #5, there is no \\&quot;lip\\&quot; at the back end of the riser to fit partly inside the bowl and protect the riser&#x27;s underside from splashings (as would happen with diarrhea).    Money does not fall down from the sky for me and what I spent on this product was a total waste of it.</li>
    <li> this item is for regular toilets, and looks of good quality. However toilets come in at least two types, the regular bowl and the elongated bowl. the description of this item did not destinguish for which type of bowl this product is made.     Unfortunately I have and needed a riser for an elongated bowl, for which this product did not fit properly, and I had to return it.     I think that the manufacturer should have either specified the type of bowl it is designed for, or gave the length dimension.</li>
    <li> We originally had  one you couldn&#x27;t use a regular toilet seat with. It was very uncomfortable to say the least. We like this one much better. I would not recommend this seat for very large bottoms, the handles would be uncomfortable. I am not a small person by any means but if you are larger than 3x size in clothes, I would recommend getting the version with out the handles.</li>
    <li> I got this seat for my father when he came home from the hospital. Installation was a snap. It is stable and fits into a tight space next to the sink cabinet by the toilet. Dad can easily get up using the handles on either side. The best thing is we could put a padded seat on top to make it more comfortable. It&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this riser is. It&#x27;s very sturdy and so easy to install. Since you put the regular toilet seat on top, my mother could barely tell it was there. The handles work better for sitting down than standing up and if the person using it is overweight with larger hips, it will be a tight fit. Overall, I would recommend this for anyone needing a raised seat. I may even put one in my own home since it helps me with my arthritic knees. Exceptional price, too!</li>
    <li> My mom loves her raised toilet seat.  She feels much more secure now since she has failing knees and hips and fears falling.  Delivery was fast and seat was easy to install.</li>
    <li> The Amazon description says this item adds five inches to the height of the seat. This didn&#x27;t agree with the information on an identical looking object on a different web site, so I checked with Improving Lifestyles, who Amazon says is the seller of this item. They tell me that it adds three and a half inches to the height. Additional information they gave me: The top of the arms are four and a half inches above the top of the seat, and the overall width of the item is twenty-one and a half inches. (outside of arm to outside of arm).  Based on other customer reviews, I&#x27;m going to proceed to buy a couple of these, though I would have preferred they be five inches tall rather than three and a half!  To follow up, we bought two of them and installed them. They achieve the objective, which was to raise the seat so it would be easier to get up and down on it. The biggest problem with them is that, because the holes for the fastening bolts are elongated (out of necessity, to adjust for alignment with different seats), it shifts out of alignment - it seems impossible to tighten the nuts/bolts sufficiently to stop that.</li>
    <li> I am a stroke survivor, paralyzed on my left side.  This product was EXACTLY  what I needed!  Easy to install and very sturdy.  However, I am a women&#x27;s size 12/14 and it is a tight fit between the handles for me.  If I was any larger, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to fit.  Also, actual height that it raises the seat is more like 3 1/2 inches, not 5 which is fine. Five would have been too high.</li>
    <li> This design is reasonably comfortable and useful, but after a while I realized that gunk was building up between the bottom of it and the top of the toilet bowl. You can slip a damp paper towel where the crack is open, but this isn&#x27;t a longterm solution. A really good cleaning requires unbolting the whole assembly.</li>
    <li> The product arrived at the door less than 24 hours after ordering.  The seat was in perfect conditions. The instructions were easy to follow and was easily installed.</li>
    <li> Great product exactly as described by Amazon.  My wife snapped her tibia and fibula bones right above her right ankle and the breaks were repaired in surgery with screws and plates.  No weight bearing on that foot for 6 weeks and it was extremely difficult for her to use the bathroom by having to lower herself on one leg even with assistance from me.  This riser made it so much easier for her especially with the handles offering support and favorable leverage and now she requires no assistance.  It is solid, well constructed, easy to put on and inexpensive.  Just what you would expect from Amazon.</li>
    <li> An excellent aid for those who need elevation and support following hip replacement. Sturdy and easy to install.  A perfect substitute for a bulky chair. Nice decor as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 of these risers for myself and my 86 year old mom.  I am tall, and after a few minutes on the low bowl, the back of my legs would \\&quot;fall asleep\\&quot;.  Raising the seat worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;My mom found the handles helped her get up from the bowl much easier.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they were a little longer to fit better on a long bowl.  They are really for the shorter bowls.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I thought of buying these a long time ago.</li>
    <li> This riser seat is quite easy to install.  Just remove the toilet seat you are currently using, place the riser on the bowl and place your exhisiting seat on top, insert the long screws and washers provided and that is it!  If you have mobility issues, I would recomend having someone who can bend down with ease tighten up the screws/washers.    The riser comes in the elongated or standard oval style.  So know what type of bowl you have prior to ordering.  It raises the toilet about 3-4 inches.  The handles on the side are appropiately placed for an assistance in getting up and sitting down.    One of the nicest qualities about this riser is that it is not an eyesore!  It doesn&#x27;t scream out \\&quot;handicap toilet.\\&quot;  I would have given this product 5 stars, but the seat does loosen up with use and the screws just need to be tightened.</li>
    <li> My Mom, who is 93 was struggling to get up and down off of the toilet.  She is in good health, but just old.  Anyway, she loves it and that is what matters.  It is a great help to her.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a raised seat that was several years old and would no longer lock safely.  My wife says it is much better and because I put a soft seat on top it is not as cold as the old seat.  It is exactly what we wanted.</li>
    <li> I ordered this toilet seat for my mother who has dementia, incontinence, and mobility issues. Although she is incontinent, I was sure that she would be able to use a toilet if the seat was higher. I purchased this raised seat with arms to hopefully solve the issue, but found it not quite high enough and I still really struggled to get her to bend down enough to sit on it. The riser was very solid, however, and I have kept it installed on the toilet downstairs. We use it sometimes.. Also, this toilet seat is for regular-sized toilets, not elongated toilets (which I have), so it doesn&#x27;t fit exactly right, but it still works.. it just fits a little funny. The misfit (at least for my model toilet.. it&#x27;s some Kohler from the &#x27;80s) does not jeopardize stability.     Anyway, what I did find to be a better solution for my mom was a commode with the bucket removed and placed directly over a toilet. The height of the commode is adjustable so it can be REALLY high, just as my mom needed it.</li>
    <li> Got this after a knee replacement and love the effortless lift. Not bad looking either. I am keeping them on for ease on leg and back.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because, on one or two occasions, my mother had difficulty getting up from the toilet. For her, pressing upon the side handles works very well. It&#x27;s a perfectly good product.  Lightweight, easy to clean (the handles need a gentle brush with soap and a little bleach from time to time because of the slightly mottled surface), and doesn&#x27;t look too bad on a white toilet.  The only problem: I&#x27;m 5&#x27;5\\&quot; and my mother is 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and this raises the toilet seat too high for both of us.  Mom&#x27;s legs are dangling, and while mine reach the floor, it&#x27;s just uncomfortable (obviously, we might feel differently if either of us had hip or back problems). On the other hand, I notice other people here have commented that the riser is not high enough.  Would be good if there were two or three heights to choose from. (I found a Japanese-made model that doesn&#x27;t any height to speak of, but it was close to $200...).</li>
    <li> I was thrilled with how this product looked, and ignored the negative reviews. When used, however, urine can get between the product and the top of the toilet bowl and there&#x27;s no way to clean that without removing it. And so it stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Might be OK on an elongated seat, or if the user isn&#x27;t male. It just doesn&#x27;t work for men on an standard (non-elongated) toilet.</li>
    <li> With no place for grab bars in my bathroom, this seat proved easy to install, not terribly bulky and the perfect support I needed after knee replacement.  Wish the dimensions were stated on your web page.  But REALLY glad I bought this item.</li>
    <li> This was what we were looking for.  There are no pieces of metal to rust like the one we bought from walgreen. Wish the at arms were a little wider though.</li>
    <li> The entire unit is a single molded piece, so nothing is adjustable.  It has no hinges so cannot be lifted for cleaning.  It&#x27;s not wide enough for a somewhat overweight person.  The side handles are too small, too low, and located too far back, and are awkward and uncomfortable for a 5&#x27;2\\&quot; senior with shoulder problems to use comfortably for standing up.  I tried to return it, but was told there is no return or refund policy,  Also, the seat had no bolts or instructions included.  To their credit, the vendor promptly sent these to me and coached me over the phone re how to install the seat. It was a mistake for me to order this, and I&#x27;ll probably never use it.</li>
