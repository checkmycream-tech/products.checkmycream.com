      <li>Mine arrived fresh and of great quality.</li>
      <li>Ok, so they&#x27;re not rancid</li>
      <li>does take a bit to soak in the skin but works better for me than lotion.</li>
      <li>If you love the smell it is for you.</li>
      <li>For the price though, I&#x27;m quite pleased and would buy it again.</li>
      <li>even more decadence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the scent, the feel and</li>
      <li>It has a lovely cocoa scent and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really fault the product for not being food grade, it says it&#x27;s cosmetic, so how could I expect anything else, but how can the difference between the two be so great?</li>
      <li>I mix it with jojoba oil n lotion for moisturizing my body and a love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m beginning to think that most of these posts were created by the company.  </li>
      <li>many many chocolate</li>
      <li>I received the product really fast, it&#x27;s exactly as pictured and has a WONDERFUL smell.  </li>
      <li>This product is great for my natural body mixtures.</li>
      <li>The price is excellent especially with the Super Saver Shipping.</li>
      <li>Either way i purchased this and unrefned shea butter and mixed them together using more cocoa butter than shea and its a great concoction.</li>
      <li>The Food grade smelled strongly of chocolate.</li>
      <li>Loved this cocoa butter because it is very fresh and high quality--great for soap making!  </li>
      <li>I mix this with Shea butter for making my absolute favorite lotion bars and chap sticks that just melt at body temperature and feel awesome and velvety buttery on dry skin.</li>
      <li>What I found was a huge relief.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was light brown and rock</li>
      <li>Went on smooth as is but melted and added jojoba and coconut oils.</li>
      <li>So natural and smells so good.</li>
      <li>It does not smell strongly of chocolate (which might be a big plus for some people), and the product is as described and of good quantity.</li>
      <li>It is perfect for the small things that I make.</li>
      <li>However, I would not recommend buying this if you are not already familiar with cosmetic verses food grade.</li>
      <li>I am pretty sure that it was the cocoa butter because I made some bars with mango and shea also and the cocoa had a ton of specs and neither of the others did.</li>
      <li>i make many of my own products, such as chapstick, and lotions.</li>
      <li>it smelled like sweet garbage.</li>
      <li>and it literally smelled good enough to eat.</li>
      <li>When I opened the package, I smelled the sweet aroma.  </li>
      <li>He described the smell as \\&quot;sweet poop\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>Ok, first thing&#x27;s first.</li>
      <li>if you melt this with Shea (maybe by itself), you need to cool it quickly in the fridge or freezer, because other wise it separates into liquid and pearls if cooled at room temperature.</li>
      <li>WHITERABBITESSENTIAL.COM, this Coco butter is priced right, comes quick and is luxurious everytime I use it.</li>
      <li>Use it right after showering and it goes on well.</li>
      <li>This product had a very strong smell I had to throw it away the same day it smelled like cocoa butter with garbage juice product was rancid!!!</li>
      <li>It melts down good &amp; mixes well.</li>
      <li>SOME SMELLS MORE LIKE CHOCOLATE THAN OTHERS, BUT NEVER THAT UNDERLYING SMELL, IMMA EMAIL AND CONTACT THEM AND UPDATE LATER</li>
      <li>Also, I noticed they raised the prices by almost $3 since my first order Jan 2013.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m not for sure on the different qualities of the butter.  </li>
      <li>your favorite chocolate and cross your fingers.</li>
      <li>used my first batch in my shea mixes with some oils.</li>
      <li>AS an AVID SOAPER AND BATH AND BODY PRODUCTS COMPANY - WWW.</li>
      <li>If it were a more familiar oil, I would say that it&#x27;s rancid, but as I&#x27;m not familiar enough with cocoa butter, I can&#x27;t say for sure that is the exact cause for the differing smell.</li>
      <li>My first experience with pure cocoa butter was Now Foods brand, food grade.</li>
      <li>The first time I purchased it Jan 2013, it was a large 17oz slab of pure cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>Makes sense, that&#x27;s pretty much what it is.</li>
      <li>Arrived 3 days early, fresh and smelling so chocolaty my dog ate some off the floor.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t REALLY need it since I prefer shea anyway.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.</li>
      <li>I imagine that there is other cosmetic grade cocoa butter that smells better than this.</li>
      <li>It seems to be good quality, but not worth the price for me since I only use it for my shea mix which I make once a year in winter.</li>
      <li>I have washed this stuff in my jeans, and had it completely disappear, but have yet to find shea and cocoa butter oil stains on my clothes, so I think its low melting temp makes for easy washing.</li>
      <li>The morality of companies is really important to me, so what I can say is that Coastal Scents has earned a long-time loyal customer as long as they keep their practices moral.</li>
      <li>The packaging is really not resealable, so I made sure to place it in a ziploc bag and squeeze all of the air out and leave in cool dry place.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that asks me where I get mine from.</li>
      <li>I am using this to make lip balm, gloss, and other more natural body care items for myself.</li>
      <li>Again, lotion bars for sale and of course the ones that happened to get the most specs were the little bride and groom heart shaped ones.</li>
      <li>my first order was much thicker and larger!</li>
      <li>but it was still fresh enough not to return it.  </li>
      <li>I mixed it right away with Coastal Scents Shea butter and essential oils and made some body butter bars and after mixing in fresh lemon juice and zest,tea tree oil and refrigerating</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;m beginning to think that most of these posts were created by the company.  This did not smell like cocoa, chocolate, or anything pleasing. It smelled rancid and rotten. My room mate equated the smell with moldy, wet gym socks.</li>
    <li> Ok, first thing&#x27;s first. The package came exactly as pictured and weighed 16.7oz including the ziploc bags, meaning that the product was at least a pound. So, the product was what was pictured in a generous quanity. If you want cosmetic grade cocoa butter, this is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I was unaware of what the difference between food grade and cosmetic grade cocoa butter would be, and it was way bigger than I thought. My first experience with pure cocoa butter was Now Foods brand, food grade. It was EXPENSIVE so I tried this, figuring that I did not need food grade since I used both butters for lotion bars. The Food grade smelled strongly of chocolate. Makes sense, that&#x27;s pretty much what it is. The cosmetic grade (THIS PRODUCT) smelled, to my untrained nose, rancid. If you are expecting chocolate, you will be disappointed. To me it smelled like chocolate mixed with toxic morning breath. I hate to be so dramatic, but I was really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, I made my lotion bars anyway, hoping that maybe the scent would be masked by the beeswax and the coconut oil. It wasn&#x27;t. I went into a near panic because I wanted to sell the lotion bars and they smelled so disgusting to me and I was kicking myself for not just returning the product. However, my pregnant sister (read \\&quot;rancid smell bloodhound sister\\&quot;) assured me that they did not actually smell rancid, though they were very different than my first round of lotion bars. Ok, so they&#x27;re not rancid, I guess that&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found little black specs in my lotion bars after making them. I am pretty sure that it was the cocoa butter because I made some bars with mango and shea also and the cocoa had a ton of specs and neither of the others did. Again, lotion bars for sale and of course the ones that happened to get the most specs were the little bride and groom heart shaped ones. (Sorry, no one cares about that but I&#x27;m still traumatized).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: If you are looking for a cosmetic grade, not super-chocolatey smelling cocoa butter, this is a good product. It does not smell strongly of chocolate (which might be a big plus for some people), and the product is as described and of good quantity. However, I would not recommend buying this if you are not already familiar with cosmetic verses food grade. It&#x27;s a big package of gross smelling waste if you&#x27;re expecting it to resemble the food grade product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 3 stars overall. One is lost due to the particulate. The other is lost because I just can&#x27;t give a shining review for something that I dislike so much. I can&#x27;t really fault the product for not being food grade, it says it&#x27;s cosmetic, so how could I expect anything else, but how can the difference between the two be so great? I imagine that there is other cosmetic grade cocoa butter that smells better than this.</li>
    <li> I tried everything. Essential oils, coconut oil, vanilla, perfume. Nothing would take away the smell. My boyfriend walked into the room and asked if the dog had an accident. He described the smell as \\&quot;sweet poop\\&quot;. I describe the smell as similar to very bad tooth decay. Very gross.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. So natural and smells so good. I usually cut them up in large chunks any use all over as a body moisturizer. I store it in the refrigerator.</li>
    <li> I almost didnt order this item becaus of a few other reviews. Mine arrived fresh and of great quality. I will use it to make my homemade lotions</li>
    <li> Arrived 3 days early, fresh and smelling so chocolaty my dog ate some off the floor. Went on smooth as is but melted and added jojoba and coconut oils. It&#x27;s all kinds of deliciously decadent on my skin. Might try whipping it with Shea butter for even more decadence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t work for the company, either *insert eye roll* I&#x27;m just a happy customer who can&#x27;t wait to order more!</li>
    <li> I bought this product, disregarding the reviews that indicated that the smell was &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; from regular cocoa butter. Unfortunately, I too found the smell to differ a bit from the unrefined cocoa butter that I usually use (a more expensive variety from the local hippie store - NOW brand perhaps?) If it were a more familiar oil, I would say that it&#x27;s rancid, but as I&#x27;m not familiar enough with cocoa butter, I can&#x27;t say for sure that is the exact cause for the differing smell. I&#x27;m still using the product, but I won&#x27;t be using it in any body creams that I give away to friends and family. Next time I use this, I&#x27;ll probably just add in some Essential Oils to counteract the strange fragrance. Good luck, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> I mix this with Shea butter for making my absolute favorite lotion bars and chap sticks that just melt at body temperature and feel awesome and velvety buttery on dry skin. does take a bit to soak in the skin but works better for me than lotion. if you melt this with Shea (maybe by itself), you need to cool it quickly in the fridge or freezer, because other wise it separates into liquid and pearls if cooled at room temperature. I’m not sure if it is the shea or the cocoa butter that causes this. Once solidified, can be left at room temperature and retain shape, but will melt in hot car, and occasionally pockets, but haven’t had it leak in jean pocket while wearing. I have washed this stuff in my jeans, and had it completely disappear, but have yet to find shea and cocoa butter oil stains on my clothes, so I think its low melting temp makes for easy washing.</li>
    <li> Smells disgusting it has a thick odor.&lt;br /&gt;The cocoa butter itself it hard like a brick, so you have to heat it up before use. But the odor is disgusting. The odor is thicker than raw apple cider which i know because i use it on my face. I hate this i did use it once. but i stopped because it was horrible to smell. I never ever throw things away because of the odor I think its a waste of money but this thing didnt seem to work it was moisturizing enough and it smelled like sweet garbage. BTW i have used shea and cocoa butter before.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before, and I&#x27;m literally about to buy again. It&#x27;s of great quality, it smells wonderful, and best of all, they obtain it through moral and helpful practices.&lt;br /&gt;As of late I&#x27;ve been trying to purchase products from morally acceptable companies. It&#x27;s really really hard, and a lot of the things I still buy are still most likely obtained through immoral practices(especially many many chocolate products).&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, so I rely on organic natural skincare so I don&#x27;t break out in rashes. I heavily rely on cocoa butter. Since cocoa is an ugly business with many companies, I was worried about buying from Coastal Scents again. What I found was a huge relief.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually really happy that Coastal Scents works with Project Ghana, cause a lot of chocolate and cocoa products are are obtained through slavery and child labor, if not unlivable wages(research your favorite chocolate and cross your fingers. Nestle is a start). The morality of companies is really important to me, so what I can say is that Coastal Scents has earned a long-time loyal customer as long as they keep their practices moral.</li>
    <li> I bought this cocoa butter from the coastal scents website. The first time I purchased it Jan 2013, it was a large 17oz slab of pure cocoa butter. It smelled like nutty chocolate, like you could taste it. It was light brown and rock hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used my first batch in my shea mixes with some oils. You need to have a lot of Shea and oils to soften coca butter, otherwise your finished product will be rock hard and impossible to use as-is. This was frustrating for me and caused me to avoid using the rest of the cocoa butter until recently. Now I figured out a good cocoa to oil ratio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my second slab during their 50% off sale last month. I am highly disappointed. The slab reads 16ounces, but it is much smaller in size to my first order slab. my first order was much thicker and larger! Also, I noticed they raised the prices by almost $3 since my first order Jan 2013. I only paid around $6 because of the half off sale, but if the prices keep raising this way, the cocoa butter would be in the $20 range in a matter of months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that&#x27;s rather ridiculous. It seems to be good quality, but not worth the price for me since I only use it for my shea mix which I make once a year in winter. I don&#x27;t REALLY need it since I prefer shea anyway. I would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good I want to just take a big bite out of it.&lt;br /&gt;Of course I dont think this is the edible type.&lt;br /&gt;I mixed this with shea butter, coconut oil and honey to make a lucious&lt;br /&gt;awesome smelling body butter. it&#x27;s great. I would recomend.</li>
    <li> i make many of my own products, such as chapstick, and lotions. I love the scent, the feel and how well this stuff melts down.  Only downside is while it does come in a ziplock bag, they always tape it down so you have to rip the bag to get it open, so it defeats the purpose of the zip-lock bag.  I highly recommend this product to anyone that asks me where I get mine from.</li>
    <li> The item smelled awful. No matter what I tried I could not get rid of the smell. I would have returned but I used up half trying to fix the smell of it. I mixed it with several different kinds of essential oils. I even tired perfume. I will not be buying from this company again. I fear my next item will have the same smell.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It is perfect for the small things that I make. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice cocoa butter.</li>
    <li> AS an AVID SOAPER AND BATH AND BODY PRODUCTS COMPANY - WWW. WHITERABBITESSENTIAL.COM, this Coco butter is priced right, comes quick and is luxurious everytime I use it.</li>
    <li> Loved this cocoa butter because it is very fresh and high quality--great for soap making!  Thank you for carrying this product</li>
    <li> Ive never bought cocoa butter before besides the kind in the stick from Wal-mart.  So I&#x27;m not for sure on the different qualities of the butter.  I bought this so I could make homemade lip balm.  I have no complaints so I&#x27;m assuming the product is a good quality.  Would definetly order again.</li>
    <li> but didnt like the packing. Either way i purchased this and unrefned shea butter and mixed them together using more cocoa butter than shea and its a great concoction.</li>
    <li> Smells divine. Cocoa butter has wonderful properties. This is great quality, and was packaged well. Very pleased with the promptness of the delivery and quality of the product. I use this in my lotion bars. Will definitely purchase this brand again.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is amazing.  I use it to make several personal care products including lotion and lip balm.  My bar was not at all rancid and even came with an expiration date.  It has a lovely cocoa aroma and is solid, but not so hard that you cannot break pieces off for whatever you want to use it for.  The packaging is really not resealable, so I made sure to place it in a ziploc bag and squeeze all of the air out and leave in cool dry place.</li>
    <li> I saw video on u tube on the benefits of this butter. It&#x27;s too hard and breaks up if you cut it. I must need to blend it with some oil or put in a microwave to get the best use.</li>
    <li> I would tell you to buy it I loved it it makes my skins fell great and the cost can&amp;#34;t be bet</li>
    <li> This product had a very strong smell I had to throw it away the same day it smelled like cocoa butter with garbage juice product was rancid!!! This was my 1st purchase of unrefined cocoa butter. I will give it one more try from another seller if product comes smelling disgusting again from a different seller then I will know that&#x27;s how it smells.</li>
    <li> I received the product really fast, it&#x27;s exactly as pictured and has a WONDERFUL smell.  I mix it with jojoba oil n lotion for moisturizing my body and a love it.  It is a lot so it will last a long time..</li>
    <li> Just got this cocoa butter in the mail and it smells awful. The closest thing I can compare the smell to is dog food. I bought cocoa butter from another seller just last month and it literally smelled good enough to eat. The smell of this stuff just about makes you want to gag. And on top of that, I rubbed a little bit into my skin to see if it had the same properties of the last cocoa butter I got, and it seemed to be ok for a few minutes, but now I&#x27;m about to claw my skin off because it&#x27;s itching like crazy and red! I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong with this stuff, but it&#x27;s definitely not right. I can&#x27;t risk using it in my lotion and soap recipes because there&#x27;s no telling how bad it would mess them up! And there&#x27;s NO WAY I&#x27;d order it again! Gross!</li>
    <li> I use this when I make my homemade deodorant. It smells great, it melts easily, and the texture is very smooth.</li>
    <li> I bought this intending to use it to make lotions &amp; etc with. It has a chocolatey smell that I like &amp; others I&#x27;ve shared it with liked. It melts down good &amp; mixes well. I&#x27;ve only used a small amount since purchasing, it doesn&#x27;t take much. I just recently used it in my batch of lip balms &amp; it&#x27;s excellent in it. When I used it in a lotion concoction, the chocolate smell overpowered anything else. I wouldn&#x27;t use in in combination with essential oils. If you use this product the way it smells will be your smell that overpowers anything else. that&#x27;s the only thing i dislike about it. I&#x27;m not complaining about the smell, I like the smell. I just didn&#x27;t think about that before I made a batch &amp; used essential oils in it &amp; it ended up smelling kind of weird. lol Thats just due to my ignorance on the matter. Overall for the price it&#x27;s a good Cocoa Butter. &amp; I would consider purchasing again.</li>
    <li> This has a heavy scent of Cocoa Butter and you either love it or you hate it. If you love the smell it is for you. If you don&#x27;t theen buy a refined cocoa butter. The price is excellent especially with the Super Saver Shipping. I use it for soap making and it beats any of the soap suppliers prices.</li>
    <li> This product is great for my natural body mixtures. It has a lovely cocoa scent and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I am using this to make lip balm, gloss, and other more natural body care items for myself. You get a lot I think, so it will last me a while. It melts down and mixes with other ingredients easily. It is bulk, so be prepared to have a sharp knife or grater.</li>
    <li> This arrived on time and smelled great in the package! It is perfect for what I needed it for. I only wish I had gotten pastilles instead. Cocoa butter isn&#x27;t easy to cut, and it gets messy when you need to measure out a few ounces at a time. For the price though, I&#x27;m quite pleased and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I melt this in a pot along with several other butters and oils and it just makes my skin so soft! It smells good too! I can&#x27;t even begin to describe all the times people have told me I smell like chocolate.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this product.  It arrived in a timely manner.  When I opened the package, I smelled the sweet aroma.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
    <li> this smells so good, and chocolatey.  I will be using it to make home made lotion bars for gifts.  Good price, too.</li>
    <li> I melt a chunk of this with olive oil in the microwave, place in a plastic container in the fridge til solid.  Use it right after showering and it goes on well.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1B268X1ZI4MED]][[ASIN:B006Y7U4T0 Coastal Scents Cocoa Butter, 16 Ounce]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK GREAT SHIPPING, GREAT PRICES,  GREAT PACKAGING, PRODUCT HMMMMMM I READ THE REVIEWS SOME WERE GOOD SOME WERE BAD, I NEEDED SOME COCOA BUTTER IN A HURRY FOR SOME HOMEMADE PRODUCTS FOR A BABY SHOWER. I HAVE BEEN MAKING PRODUCTS FOR 12 YEARS NOW. WHEN I OPENED IT, NO COCOA BUTTER SMELL, WELL IT WAS A FAINT CHOCOLATE SMELL, WITH AN UNDERTONE OF LIKE THE SMELL OF OLD BABY FORMULA THAT HAS BEEN SITTING IN A CAR FOR 2 DAYS IN LOUISIANA MUGGY SWAMP WEATHER. ALSO IT LOOK LIKE MOLD WAS ON IT. IM USED TO BUYING COCOA BUTTER SOME SMELLS MORE LIKE CHOCOLATE THAN OTHERS, BUT NEVER THAT UNDERLYING SMELL, IMMA EMAIL AND CONTACT THEM AND UPDATE LATER SO YOU CAN KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.....MAYBE I GOT A BAD BATCH, WOULDNT WRITE THE SELLER OFF UNTILI KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE.........</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter was a little on the strong side but it was still fresh enough not to return it.  I mixed it right away with Coastal Scents Shea butter and essential oils and made some body butter bars and after mixing in fresh lemon juice and zest,tea tree oil and refrigerating it smelled and worked wonderfully.  I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> Solid sealed package. No leaks or drips. It smells nice and I am sure will make great soap. I like to rub it onto my dry skin as well as use for making moisturizing soap.</li>
    <li> I made soap with it, and it turned out wonderful. It smelled nice too. I just used 1 ounce in 2.5 pound batch.</li>
    <li> This cocoa butter is good quality but it is very hard to break apart!</li>
