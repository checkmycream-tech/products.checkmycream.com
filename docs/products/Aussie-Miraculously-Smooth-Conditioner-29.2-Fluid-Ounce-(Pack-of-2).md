### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with all Aussie shampoo products</li>
      <li>Not with this, Aussie has the best smelling products for my hair and as soon as i put it it is like a surge of moisture.</li>
      <li>Great smell!</li>
      <li>It lasts forever (even when you use a lot each time) and smells great.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo</li>
      <li>Great conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and it was a great price!</li>
      <li>Great product with an awesome smell and leaves you hair sooo smooth.</li>
      <li>Also, it smells good</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good price.</li>
      <li>Excellent quality and reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>This is a great package because it comes with two for a relatively cheap price.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Aussie products before and really liked them, but I&#x27;ve been using Bed Head for about 2 years now</li>
      <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve been ordered products through Amazon and love them.  </li>
      <li>Hair is left feeling great and smells good, but could smell better.  </li>
      <li>My hair holds styling much better when I use this.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>Favorite conditioner for my curly hair.</li>
      <li>I picked this product because most people love it, and I thought why not.</li>
      <li>My favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>vs here, Amazon is just more convenient</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t order.</li>
      <li>, best idea I&#x27;ve had, to get different kinds, my hair loves it</li>
      <li>Aussie is a pretty good brand.  </li>
      <li>It is very price savvy and smells super good!</li>
      <li>how can you beat these huge containers for such a great price.  </li>
      <li>I bought it along with the shampoo for Miraculously Smooth.  </li>
      <li>I picked this stuff up at Target for $5, which I think is far more appropriate given the quality.</li>
      <li>but I think Bed Head is better quality and doesn&#x27;t actually cost much more if you get it online.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Delivery was fast with the Super Saver Shipping</li>
      <li>I have never lost so much hair so quickly.</li>
      <li>First of all, the smell makes me want to vomit - it smells that a mix of gasoline and cleaning products.</li>
      <li>it really helps to hydrate your hair!</li>
      <li>This is a great conditioner and works well on thick hair.  </li>
      <li>I like this brand and appreciate being able to have it delivered to the door rather than dragging it home from the local store.</li>
      <li>, I also love and use the heat protector for flat ironing or tanning, 3 minute miracle and the leave in conditioner spray, I chose what to use depending on how my hair is that day, I recommend to anyone</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not annoying enough to stop using, but still worth mentioning.</li>
      <li>Aussie is the only brand I&#x27;ve found good enough to keep getting, it works best for my hair type, my hair gets kinda dry, but oily like, so i get moist shampoo to help the dry feeling and miraculously smooth conditioner to keep it healthy feeling, moist conditioner makes the oily problem worse</li>
      <li>I also do not experience any type of residue left over like some conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon and prime for my clean, luscious locks!</li>
      <li>Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of purchasing an item like this (even though its a two pack it still costs more than the regular 12.5oz in stores).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>do like how much softer my hair feels after using this.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Aussie products for a very long time and have gotten comments on how good my hair smells (strange, but still flattering).  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend buying.</li>
      <li>I have natural 4c hair and this made my coils pop!!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s twice the cost, but I think it&#x27;s worth it personally.</li>
      <li>Works great for my thin dry hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair completely soaks out up.</li>
      <li>and I like how soft it is</li>
      <li>Secondly, you can compare this to the Bed Head products, which, if you get the green bottles, are $20 on here for two of them with free shipping.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, thick hair and need a lot of conditioner, so Aussie&#x27;s 29.2 Fl Oz pump bottle was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>

<li> and you have to really pump hard to get anything out</li>
<li> I have tried other products of course but nothing ever worked, nothing is ever conditioning enough for my hair.</li>
<li> Works well on long hair that gets a lot of washes due to sports.</li>
<li> And this product definitely does not smooth - it makes my hair clumpy and rough.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to rinse out completelY</li>
<li> It seems to work fine on my hair though, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad shampoo in and of itself.&lt;br</li>
<li> This doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone, but it is so not worth the risk.</li>
<li> By the end of the day I usually felt really dry.</li>
<li> I usually get a Bed Head set of shampoo and conditioner, which lasts me up to 5 months, but I was a little tight on cash</li>
<li> I really appreciate this product, and I&#x27;ve been a faithful consumer with multiple purchases, but this time when I went to re-up, I was disappointed to find that the price had increased from $10.94 to $22.95!</li>
<li> I usually pick the &amp;#34;Moist&amp;#34; version but this one works too.</li>
<li> /&gt;However, the price is ridiculous on here.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product, but I am disgusted with the direction</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bad thing, it&#x27;s just something to think about if you prefer to be a bit less-perfumed.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll use this stuff til it&#x27;s gone</li>
<li> Wrong choice!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent quality and reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> I like the Aussie product line.  This is a great conditioner and works well on thick hair.  Highly recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for years now. I usually pick the &amp;#34;Moist&amp;#34; version but this one works too. It is very price savvy and smells super good!</li>
    <li> I really appreciate this product, and I&#x27;ve been a faithful consumer with multiple purchases, but this time when I went to re-up, I was disappointed to find that the price had increased from $10.94 to $22.95! Was there a sudden decrease in the world&#x27;s supply of smoothing conditioner? I highly recommend this product, but I am disgusted with the direction the price went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note my purchase history says I purchased it from Amazon LLC, and I don&#x27;t think I see them listed as one of the two sellers, so maybe that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ll definitely be looking elsewhere, though. That&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Works great for my thin dry hair.  Gives it some weight, so it&#x27;s not so frizzy.  My hair holds styling much better when I use this.</li>
    <li> I usually get a Bed Head set of shampoo and conditioner, which lasts me up to 5 months, but I was a little tight on cash so got a set of this stuff instead. I&#x27;ve used Aussie products before and really liked them, but I&#x27;ve been using Bed Head for about 2 years now so I think I&#x27;m a bit biased going back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the Aussie brand smells quite a bit stronger. I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bad thing, it&#x27;s just something to think about if you prefer to be a bit less-perfumed. It seems to work fine on my hair though, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad shampoo in and of itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the price is ridiculous on here. I picked this stuff up at Target for $5, which I think is far more appropriate given the quality. Secondly, you can compare this to the Bed Head products, which, if you get the green bottles, are $20 on here for two of them with free shipping. That&#x27;s twice the cost, but I think it&#x27;s worth it personally. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ll use this stuff til it&#x27;s gone and I do like it, but I think Bed Head is better quality and doesn&#x27;t actually cost much more if you get it online.</li>
    <li> My favorite conditioner. Works well on long hair that gets a lot of washes due to sports.</li>
    <li> This is a great package because it comes with two for a relatively cheap price.  I bought it along with the shampoo for Miraculously Smooth.  Aussie is a pretty good brand.  Also, it smells good and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on how good my hair smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was fast with the Super Saver Shipping</li>
    <li> I picked this product because most people love it, and I thought why not. Wrong choice! First of all, the smell makes me want to vomit - it smells that a mix of gasoline and cleaning products. Secondly, it does reduce frizz, literally. By taking out all of your hair. I have never lost so much hair so quickly. And this product definitely does not smooth - it makes my hair clumpy and rough. This doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone, but it is so not worth the risk.</li>
    <li> Hair is left feeling great and smells good, but could smell better.  At this price though, who can complain?</li>
    <li> Good price. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> Great conditioner. My hair completely soaks out up. My only complaint is that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to rinse out completelY</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and I keep coming back every time I try something else.</li>
    <li> how can you beat these huge containers for such a great price.  Great product with an awesome smell and leaves you hair sooo smooth.</li>
    <li> Great smell! Makes hair easier to detangle. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like this brand and appreciate being able to have it delivered to the door rather than dragging it home from the local store.</li>
    <li> Bought this to condition hair after bleaching and dyeing....it really helps to hydrate your hair!</li>
    <li> I was going to order this online for my daughter, but then noticed the price.  You can get it in the store for $5.99 per 29.2 ounces.  This is highway robbery.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t order.</li>
    <li> Favorite conditioner for my curly hair. I have tried other products of course but nothing ever worked, nothing is ever conditioning enough for my hair. By the end of the day I usually felt really dry. Not with this, Aussie has the best smelling products for my hair and as soon as i put it it is like a surge of moisture. Will always come back for me. I will probably start hoarding it.</li>
    <li> Very happy with all Aussie shampoo products</li>
    <li> This is perfection! I have natural 4c hair and this made my coils pop!!</li>
    <li> Aussie is the only brand I&#x27;ve found good enough to keep getting, it works best for my hair type, my hair gets kinda dry, but oily like, so i get moist shampoo to help the dry feeling and miraculously smooth conditioner to keep it healthy feeling, moist conditioner makes the oily problem worse, best idea I&#x27;ve had, to get different kinds, my hair loves it and I like how soft it is, I also love and use the heat protector for flat ironing or tanning, 3 minute miracle and the leave in conditioner spray, I chose what to use depending on how my hair is that day, I recommend to anyone and I have picky hair, two bottles for ten bucks saves you like a buck from stores vs here, Amazon is just more convenient</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and it was a great price!</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t start purchasing Aussie shampoo and conditioner until living in Hawaii several years ago.  Since then, I&#x27;ve been ordered products through Amazon and love them.  Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of purchasing an item like this (even though its a two pack it still costs more than the regular 12.5oz in stores).&lt;br /&gt;I do like how much softer my hair feels after using this.  I also do not experience any type of residue left over like some conditioners I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon and prime for my clean, luscious locks!</li>
    <li> I have very curly, thick hair and need a lot of conditioner, so Aussie&#x27;s 29.2 Fl Oz pump bottle was exactly what I was looking for.  It lasts forever (even when you use a lot each time) and smells great.  I have been using Aussie products for a very long time and have gotten comments on how good my hair smells (strange, but still flattering).  You cannot beat this price for the two pack.  The only thing I wish the company could change (well all companies that use pump bottles) is when it is nearing the end and you have to really pump hard to get anything out even though there is a lot left at the bottom.  It&#x27;s not annoying enough to stop using, but still worth mentioning.</li>
