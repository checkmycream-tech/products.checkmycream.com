      <li>I love Paul Mitchell products.</li>

      <li>I have long hair and it works great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good for the entire day.</li>
      <li>All the Paul Mitchell for curly hair makes my hair feel like it has more volume, I do not need anything that wants to add volume to this mop of mine.</li>
      <li>One day it looks great the next not so much.</li>
      <li>I found it works best if I just- going from dry to curly- spray my hair with water until damp and apply as though it&#x27;s just regular gel.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product as I&#x27;d heard it&#x27;s good for coarse, curly hair.</li>
      <li>I have wavy hair and just a little dab of this and then air drying is all I need for my hair to look more polished and have more defined curls/wave.</li>
      <li>Great for long or short hair.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly as it say it will.</li>
      <li>(I have long, fine hair, but lots of it!)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still great just only use a little.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I had hoped this would help but it didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
      <li>and it can get really frizzy.</li>
      <li>And shipping was fast and efficient</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really receive any waves from it, but then again, my hair isn&#x27;t very wavy.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls, but it is not drying...</li>
      <li>Those who said their hair was sticky or crunchy used too much.</li>
      <li>This product works really well</li>
      <li>It makes my hair really curly and gives it lots of body.</li>
      <li>I have fine, straight, long hair.</li>
      <li>The product smells great and it really worked well this past week when I was away and left my hairbrush athome.</li>
      <li>and I was able to look great with casual curls all week long - even washing my hair 2x a day on a cruise.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my daughter, she has vey long smooth hair.</li>
      <li>Remember less is more with this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m constantly trying to find a good product for my curly/wavy hair that will keep away frizz but not make my hair stiff.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My daughter and I have very naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>Finally something not for curly or straight hair, but for wavy!</li>
      <li>so well so softly sculpt waves without making them crunchy!</li>
      <li>So far, it&#x27;s stickier, and my hair loses the curl more quickly than other brands I have used.</li>
      <li>It does exactly as described, however too much of it makes your hard and crunchy.</li>
      <li>I have long naturally curly hair.</li>
      <li>this really helps with using less spray</li>
      <li>Adds lots of curl and volume to my fine thin hair.</li>

<li> I have medium long  curly hair.  </li>
<li> , I had the same result: crunchy, sticky, brittle, uneven waves.  </li>
<li> A little goes a long way with this.</li>
<li> I have extremely curly and frizzy hair.</li>
<li> I have curly hair and this gives hold as well as body and volume with out weighing the hair down</li>
<li> it was way too heavy and made my hair look flat and straight and feel dirty.  </li>

<li> waste of money.</li>
<li> This product only straightened my naturally wavy hair :(  </li>
<li> Then I take it down and add about a dime size of product, scrunch my hair a little and boom, beach body waves!!</li>
<li> What a waste of money!  </li>
<li> I even tried using just a small amount.  </li>
<li> I ran out of my usual curl cream</li>
<li> Well, it didn&#x27;t matter whether i used a small amount or a lot</li>
<li> I hate always having to use hairspray to tame my wind dings as I like to call them, the small twisted strands of hair that stick straight up in the air after styling it.</li>
<li> seriously felt like I had just put glue in my hair.</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair awkward crunchy or wet looking</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I was never satisfied and continued to buy product after product.</li>
<li> we go again a broken record...</li>
<li> I have thin wavey hair and this cream gives my hair lots of volume.</li>
<li> Too expensive.</li>
<li> and there it was so needless to say I do my shopping with you all from now on...</li>
<li> horrible produtt.</li>

    <li> So glad to find this on Amazon! It is a great product!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work for our hair at all. My daughter and I have very naturally curly hair and it can get really frizzy. I had hoped this would help but it didn&#x27;t do much at all.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly as it say it will. The directions say to put into sections and then use. I found it works best if I just- going from dry to curly- spray my hair with water until damp and apply as though it&#x27;s just regular gel. I love this product though!</li>
    <li> Adds a nice shine to curly hair and helps take out the tangles.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!  Throw it in my hair, scrunch and go.</li>
    <li> I have extremely curly and frizzy hair. I hate always having to use hairspray to tame my wind dings as I like to call them, the small twisted strands of hair that stick straight up in the air after styling it. this really helps with using less spray</li>
    <li> I ran out of my usual curl cream so I decided to try This one. My hair was sticky and crunchy. I was so upset. Had to re wash my hair and find another product to use. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have wavy hair and just a little dab of this and then air drying is all I need for my hair to look more polished and have more defined curls/wave.</li>
    <li> I have medium long  curly hair.  This keeps the frizz down so my hair doesn&#x27;t look so messy - no residue.  I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Adds lots of curl and volume to my fine thin hair.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of products for my curly hair, and this one is the best. No frizz and keeps my hair in spiral curls. Remember less is more with this product. Those who said their hair was sticky or crunchy used too much.</li>
    <li> horrible produtt. waste of money. wish i would have returned it and got my money back</li>
    <li> Hi,got items,Thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, she has vey long smooth hair. She wanted something (hair styling product) to give her hair some texture. This works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased every product under the sun to get my wavy hair to curl and not look fuzzy. Unfortunately, I was never satisfied and continued to buy product after product. I like the Mousse Paul Mitchell makes, I have used it for years. So when I saw they made P.M. Curls Ultimate, I immediately started looking for where I could buy it. Thank you AMAZON!! I would definitely recommend this to a friend.&lt;br /&gt;S. D., Ohio</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product as I&#x27;d heard it&#x27;s good for coarse, curly hair. Well, it didn&#x27;t matter whether i used a small amount or a lot, I had the same result: crunchy, sticky, brittle, uneven waves.  My hair felt like hay. The good?  It smelled nice.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much for my curls, but it is not drying... If you are looking for a product to boost your curls (as I was), this is not it!</li>
    <li> This product only straightened my naturally wavy hair :(  it was way too heavy and made my hair look flat and straight and feel dirty.  I even tried using just a small amount.  What a waste of money!  (I have long, fine hair, but lots of it!)</li>
    <li> Certo good transacion. Thanks.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this. It does exactly as described, however too much of it makes your hard and crunchy. I had curly hair and crunchy is not what I like. It&#x27;s still great just only use a little.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and volume this product adds to my hair. I didn&#x27;t really receive any waves from it, but then again, my hair isn&#x27;t very wavy.</li>

    <li> I have long naturally curly hair. If you have curly hair you understand that it has a mind of its own! One day it looks great the next not so much. This product works really well and I have more good hair days than not!</li>
    <li> I was told by the stores here we go again a broken record...NO!!! or only hair dressers can get this? WELL my hair dresser tried to get it for me but they are always OUT OF IT???  AND AGAIN I went on-line and there it was so needless to say I do my shopping with you all from now on...this stuff that Paul Mittchell makes is the best product out there for wavy or curly hair...love it and love you all!!!!</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this as there was an article in a magazine raving about how good it was. So far, it&#x27;s stickier, and my hair loses the curl more quickly than other brands I have used. Too expensive.</li>
    <li> Best curl stuff!! I have tried every curl cream/gel out there and this is a great one. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair awkward crunchy or wet looking and it lasts for awhile. And shipping was fast and efficient</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight, long hair. I put my hair in a pony tail &amp; curl it with a curling wand. Then I take it down and add about a dime size of product, scrunch my hair a little and boom, beach body waves!! I Love this Stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly trying to find a good product for my curly/wavy hair that will keep away frizz but not make my hair stiff. All I need is a dime sized dollop (I have shoulder length hair) and I&#x27;m good for the entire day. My hair is soft and the curls are perfect.</li>
