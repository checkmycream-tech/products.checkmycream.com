      <li>I love Trugel products!  </li>
      <li>But this brand works amazingly well.</li>
      <li>I got this yesterday,which was 3 days after ordering, so I&#x27;m super happy about the deilvery time.</li>
      <li>It does protect my nail polish from chipping as any gel top coat would....</li>
      <li>Know that everything kinda stays tacky until you cure the top coat and wipe away the residue with rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>better than nail salons.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
      <li>I have a 54 Watt UV light and after curing the 3 minutes, so far it has been great!</li>
      <li>I cured the top coat under the uv light as directed .</li>
      <li>Kept my nails looking shiny and strong for two weeks.</li>
      <li>I love this top coat, cures fast and easy with a 36 watt uv lamp.</li>
      <li>It does not work, i put my hand under the uv light 3 times and still no drying.</li>
      <li>After that was sorted, it sat under the UV light for five minutes per coat.</li>
      <li>Anyway, TruGel is a great little product :)</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to clean off your skin</li>
      <li>Very shiny and no chipping on my free edges!</li>
      <li>It lasted the full 2 weeks with no chips</li>
      <li>I really like the polish and the top coat; both are durable and the top coat is really shiny.</li>
      <li>I have no idea why, have read all other feedbacks about it, everyone was happy.</li>
      <li>I used this product on acryclics and was pleased after application it was shiny and smooth and looked professional.</li>
      <li>It is super runny.</li>
      <li>I used it as a top coat for a regular nail polish with an LED light.  </li>
      <li>it was worth the purchase.</li>
      <li>20 minutes later, I bumped a finger and got a smudge - the top coat seemed fine, and I&#x27;m almost positive it was the nail polish underneath.  </li>
      <li>I use this gel as a top coat over my regular nail polishes.</li>
      <li>2 minutes exactly,</li>
      <li>i will buy more products in the future.</li>
      <li>The first time I topped my acrylics with this, I was bummed because it chipped and peeled at the end.</li>
      <li>I love that it can be used with regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>Once I repainted the nails, and let the polish dry more, there were no problems</li>
      <li>if I put the top coat on too thick, if it was the light (also new) or the nail polish I used - So all in all, I am happy with the product, but i would suggest if you&#x27;re using a regular nail polish, let it dry before using this product.</li>
      <li>Stays on really well</li>
      <li>Very shiny and durable.</li>
      <li>but I was also more careful.  </li>
      <li>This little inexpensive bottle of polish compares very favorably to brands selling for triple the price and more.  </li>
      <li>My regular nail polish last for more than 3 weeks</li>
      <li>I love it when I finish doing my builder gel, and then paint with any regular polish then t let it dry for aprox.</li>
      <li>but I do not see a difference between this product and clear nail polish.</li>
      <li>Even on my young daughters.</li>
      <li>Three coats later it was very shiny and seemed to be quite durable.</li>
      <li>Some people say it&#x27;s too thin, but that just means you have to make sure there isn&#x27;t a lot on the brush.</li>
      <li>You have to let your regular nail polish dry very well before you use this.</li>
      <li>I found that after curing for only 2 minutes and wiping away the tacky layer, that it felt slightly gooey still (I thought it was because it was still fresh), so I should have realized then that it wasn&#x27;t cured 100%.</li>

<li> they air dried on my hot pink nails</li>
<li> As long as they don&#x27;t peel or bite it off.</li>
<li> It is absolutely not clear and shining...</li>
<li> however, it&#x27;s not as shiny as I expected.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way!</li>
<li> if you&#x27;re doing your nails by yourself, do one hand from start to finish before moving on to the other hand.</li>

<li> It was a little runny, so just be careful when applying!</li>
<li> so I bought myself the bonder, base and top coats and a few colors</li>
<li> After a few uses the product bubbles and clumps.</li>
<li> I dried it for 2 minutes, and with alcohol to eliminate the stickiness.  </li>
<li> The only negative is that it&#x27;s very hard to remove, even with 100% acetone -</li>
<li> but I suppose that&#x27;s part of what makes it so durable, so maybe that&#x27;s not a true negative.  </li>
<li> I applied a very thin layer to begin with and by the time I had finished the other four nails it had dripped down my toes.</li>
<li> An hour later this stuff was peeling off like crazy.</li>
<li> I seriously scored!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
<li> Very thick and DURABLE.</li>
<li> I was wrong.</li>
<li> but the polish is very thin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m really not impressed with the base coat which was runny and seeped onto my cuticles.</li>
<li> I was disappointed as with in 2 days it chipped.</li>

    <li> Best top coat ever! Very thick and DURABLE. better than nail salons.</li>
    <li> It is absolutely not clear and shining... I have no idea why, have read all other feedbacks about it, everyone was happy. But not me..</li>
    <li> This little inexpensive bottle of polish compares very favorably to brands selling for triple the price and more.  It doesn&#x27;t chip and it dries to a super-hard finish.  The only negative is that it&#x27;s very hard to remove, even with 100% acetone - but I suppose that&#x27;s part of what makes it so durable, so maybe that&#x27;s not a true negative.  Anyway, TruGel is a great little product :)</li>
    <li> Kept my nails looking shiny and strong for two weeks.</li>
    <li> It does protect my nail polish from chipping as any gel top coat would.... however, it&#x27;s not as shiny as I expected.</li>
    <li> I used this product on acryclics and was pleased after application it was shiny and smooth and looked professional. after a couple days though it started peeling. it peeled on several of my clients nails as well. I would not recommend for acrylics.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to Ezflow&#x27;s Trugel polish at my local salon. It lasted the full 2 weeks with no chips so I bought myself the bonder, base and top coats and a few colors so I can do it at home.  I&#x27;m really not impressed with the base coat which was runny and seeped onto my cuticles. I really like the polish and the top coat; both are durable and the top coat is really shiny.</li>
    <li> I use this gel as a top coat over my regular nail polishes. You have to let your regular nail polish dry very well before you use this. But this brand works amazingly well. I will definitely be reordering this when I start running low, which will be soon because I use it on every manicure.</li>
    <li> I figured since this topcoat had 4.5 stars it was worth the purchase. I was wrong. This topcoat is horrendous. It is super runny. I applied a very thin layer to begin with and by the time I had finished the other four nails it had dripped down my toes. After that was sorted, it sat under the UV light for five minutes per coat. Three coats later it was very shiny and seemed to be quite durable. An hour later this stuff was peeling off like crazy. I&#x27;ll try IBD next since their brand has been reliable. If all else fails, stick with the Gelish top coat. That is, unless you want to repaint your gel polish every hour, in which case, this is the top coat for you!</li>
    <li> great. i like this product line. i will buy more products in the future. this product will be a part of my nail staple</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an alright product but I do not see a difference between this product and clear nail polish. I do have to use my gel nail dyer to set this.</li>
    <li> Works great. Goes over any polish and stays on for weeks. Even on my young daughters. As long as they don&#x27;t peel or bite it off. But that&#x27;s not the polish&#x27;s fault! I use it after i get my nails done and it keeps my polish on until I take it off. Even swimming, tanning, yard work, everything.</li>
    <li> This item is brill though I needed to cure a bit longer than it says on the bottle but it&#x27;s really good and flows on great love it xxxx</li>
    <li> I am in love with doing my nails with Gel at home!! Here&#x27;s a tip... if you&#x27;re doing your nails by yourself, do one hand from start to finish before moving on to the other hand. Know that everything kinda stays tacky until you cure the top coat and wipe away the residue with rubbing alcohol. Don&#x27;t forget to clean off your skin/cuticles with your opposite thumb nail BEFORE you cure the coat of polish!!</li>
    <li> The first time I topped my acrylics with this, I was bummed because it chipped and peeled at the end. So I removed it, and tried even thinner coats and let it cure for 3 minutes, instead of the 2 it says on the bottle. I have a 54 Watt UV light and after curing the 3 minutes, so far it has been great! Very shiny and no chipping on my free edges! I found that after curing for only 2 minutes and wiping away the tacky layer, that it felt slightly gooey still (I thought it was because it was still fresh), so I should have realized then that it wasn&#x27;t cured 100%. Some people say it&#x27;s too thin, but that just means you have to make sure there isn&#x27;t a lot on the brush. Personally, I like the consistency. 4 stars because I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better one out there, but for the price, this top coat&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> Can not use the brush it comes with. After a few uses the product bubbles and clumps. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> chips as a regular nail polish, only lasted 2 days.</li>
    <li> It can be use on regular nail polish.  I love it when I finish doing my builder gel, and then paint with any regular polish then t let it dry for aprox. 4 hours. Then I apply my True gel, cure and wallah!!!!!!!! Very shiny and durable. My regular nail polish last for more than 3 weeks</li>
    <li> I tried this out last week - I used it as a top coat for a regular nail polish with an LED light.  I dried it for 2 minutes, and with alcohol to eliminate the stickiness.  20 minutes later, I bumped a finger and got a smudge - the top coat seemed fine, and I&#x27;m almost positive it was the nail polish underneath.  Once I repainted the nails, and let the polish dry more, there were no problems but I was also more careful.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if I put the top coat on too thick, if it was the light (also new) or the nail polish I used - So all in all, I am happy with the product, but i would suggest if you&#x27;re using a regular nail polish, let it dry before using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great top coat</li>
    <li> I used this over regular nail polish. As it said It can be used that way. I cured the top coat under the uv light as directed . I was disappointed as with in 2 days it chipped.</li>
    <li> Stays on really well but the polish is very thin. Runs down on your cuticles. I will use it since I have it but will not order it again.</li>
    <li> It does not work, i put my hand under the uv light 3 times and still no drying. Finally i went to sleep n they air dried on my hot pink nails and you could see where i applied all the gel on each nail.</li>
    <li> Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++</li>
    <li> I got this yesterday,which was 3 days after ordering, so I&#x27;m super happy about the deilvery time. Tried it out today, and for the price..I seriously scored!&lt;br /&gt;Just follow the directions on the back. 2 minutes exactly, and the result are shiny, beautiful, nails!&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall to it?... It was a little runny, so just be careful when applying! A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I love this top coat, cures fast and easy with a 36 watt uv lamp. I love that it can be used with regular nail polish. I also love that ez flow has a number of amazing gel nail polishes! I will definately be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> I love Trugel products!  This top coat is great.</li>
