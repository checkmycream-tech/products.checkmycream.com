      <li>The main downside with this product is its thickness-</li>
      <li>Although it feels moist, it made my eyes look older.</li>

      <li>It covers well, is non-comedogenic, and made of mostly natural ingredients-</li>
      <li>awesome for blemishes and under the eyes (must apply makeup base for under eyes</li>
      <li>the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; makes it harder to regulate how much comes off when applied.</li>
      <li>I mistook it for the foundation, which is much creamier and less cakey.</li>

    <li> Holy crap this product is amazing. Used it on mild acne/scars and it works perfectly. As a guy, it&#x27;s nice to have a discreet product that I can whip out.</li>
    <li> I really like the way it looks on my skin. It is a little thicker than some other formulas so use a brush during application.</li>
    <li> i love this concealer better than i expected so nice and creamy like butterrr</li>
    <li> Been using this for probably 3-4 years. Medium coverage &amp; stays put. Minimal creasing under eye when humid but easily blends in.</li>
    <li> i need a color closer to my skin tone.</li>
    <li> I first tried Tarte Amazonian Clay after reading reviews online. I was looking for something that would last all day and provide enough coverage for my wedding day. I wanted to do my makeup myself and bought this a few months in advance to &amp;#34;practice&amp;#34; with. It worked wonderfully and in combination with Tarte&#x27;s Amazonian Clay Foundation, it is now part of my nearly-everyday makeup routine. I have very fair, acne-prone, sensitive skin and this foundation gives me great coverage while still allowing me to look natural and not overdone. It covers red areas and flaws easily and doesn&#x27;t wear off all day. I&#x27;ve now been using this product for 2 years and will continue to do so!</li>
    <li> great for the purse for quick touch ups.</li>
    <li> Covers great. Only reason that it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that I do need to reapply to last all day.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am no longer able to purchase it from the original retailer.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon and have it delivered to my home.  The color is perfect and the product blends nicely with the skin to cover under eye circles and redness around the nose.  The product stays put once applied even in the heat of summer.  It will only come off if you wipe it or sometimes when using a tissue.  The amount of product in the tube lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have tried many concealers over the years, and wanted to try something that was nontoxic. I read that this brand uses no harmful ingredients. Let me tell you, this is the best concealer I have ever used. It&#x27;s super creamy, blends well, and lasts ALL DAY. The color I got is pretty light. I may go a shade darker next time, but it&#x27;s really not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;I take a water aerobics class and it lasts through the swimming time with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Pretty good concealer stick. Good choice of colors and is very creamy. Good coverage</li>
    <li> really dried out my skin, but went on nicely</li>
    <li> perfect blend on my skin tone</li>
    <li> This item is okay. I mistook it for the foundation, which is much creamier and less cakey. This product does not blend that well. I was honestly disappointed. :/</li>
    <li> Not my fave but it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s supposed to be illuminating but looks cakey and obvious on my skin.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this concealer.&lt;br /&gt;-It goes on matte. I dont need powder over this to take the shine away. (Had to do this with my makeup forever concealer)&lt;br /&gt;-It blends into the skin flawlessly&lt;br /&gt;- Very soft smooth upon application but then it doesnt budge off the skin. I can touch my face and know my concealer wont come off.&lt;br /&gt;-Full coverage&lt;br /&gt;-Doesnt look cakey&lt;br /&gt;-love the packaging it looks like a little lipstick&lt;br /&gt;-Works awesome for blemishes and under the eyes (must apply makeup base for under eyes so it doesnt settle in lines - I personally use Clarin&#x27;s \\&quot;Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Goes on easy, blends in nice. Great coverage.</li>
    <li> Love this cover up!! Great staying power without a lot of caking.</li>
    <li> this is the best concealer EVER!&lt;br /&gt;i used to buy the  Cover girl, maybelline stuff, but spending a bit extra on this is sooo worth it! smooth coverage and light weight makes me love it more! it arrived promptly with no damages and i was very happy</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and this tends to come off so I need to reapply.</li>
    <li> After years of looking, this is by-far my favorite concealer for daily wear.  It covers well, is non-comedogenic, and made of mostly natural ingredients- a must for me. The main downside with this product is its thickness- the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; makes it harder to regulate how much comes off when applied. I only use the product under my eyes in the morning but I go through one stick every other month. Is this standard for other users?</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was needing.</li>
    <li> I am over 50 with minimum wrinkles around my eyes, but the perpertual dark circle. I love the ORIGINAL Tarte in a tube, so I thought I would try this. Within an hour it settled into what few wrinkles I have sufficiently enough that I could see them in a mirror held at arm&#x27;s length. I used the product with a high-end primer and without. Although it feels moist, it made my eyes look older. The color is good though and it may work on someone else.</li>
    <li> Best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> Love love love this concealer!!!</li>
    <li> Great concealer. Silky coverage. It&#x27;s light weight and last 12 hours.</li>
