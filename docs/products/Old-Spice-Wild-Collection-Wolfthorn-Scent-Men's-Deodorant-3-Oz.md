      <li>I just love, love, love it!</li>
      <li>This works so well and the scent is so pleasant and mild</li>
      <li>I am always getting comments on how good I smell, I was told yesterday that I smelled delicious by a girl standing behind me in line at starbucks, had to share that lol,</li>
      <li>reminds me of oranges/citrtus super dope another good alt to the og spice.</li>
      <li>Love this scent on my husband.</li>
      <li>My go-to choice is their \\&quot;[[ASIN:B008HQ8M0Y Swagger]]\\&quot; scent, which is more classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it still works a lot longer than most</li>
      <li>Love that it&#x27;s just a deodorant and not an antiperspirant</li>
      <li>I love this deodorant, women love this deodorant.. can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores any longer..</li>
      <li>As George Carlin once said, too many men try to smell like a darn pine tree (paraphrasing).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m okay with this.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>You won&#x27;t find a better deal in stores</li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>I Picked up a stick of lionpride and it&#x27;s way better.</li>
      <li>It also makes Wolfthorn a more unisex scent, like comparable competitors</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite deodorants.  </li>
      <li>Girls love the smell of it too</li>
      <li>I fackin love</li>
      <li>i will buy more.</li>
      <li>love this smell, drives the strippers/</li>
      <li>Love the candy like smell and my wife digs it as well.</li>
      <li>Its a amazing fragrancy, citric and sweet, durable all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought 5.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>and it smells pretty good</li>
      <li>The stuff works fine, so it gets three stars, but the smell is bizarre and kind of off-putting.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprisingly fine with that, every time I catch the scent I can&#x27;t help but smile and it puts me in a good mood.</li>
      <li>I was pretty impressed with the aroma of the old spice wolfthorn scent.</li>
      <li>B000V3IKEE Pacific Surge]], and replaces PacSurge&#x27;s lighter water lily foundation with a strong juniper scent, which has the effect of making Wolfthorn smell like a bag of jelly beans with a light citrus undertone.  </li>
      <li>Am I part of some huge marketing joke?</li>
      <li>a fantastic lady deodorant at that.</li>
      <li>I avoid the aluminum in antiperspirant formulas and this is aluminum free.  </li>
      <li>As much as the scent it nice</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth, not sticky.</li>
      <li>I wanted an aluminum free deodorant, and my sister suggested this.</li>
      <li>Even FREE did not make this deodorant acceptable.</li>
      <li>I think Old Spice is really on to something great here, and I look forward to making this my main deodorant for a good while.</li>
      <li>I am quite happy to report that after receiving a free package of this in the mail a couple of weeks ago, I have not been bitten by a single werewolf.</li>
      <li>marketing will stick, Wolfthorne is a great supplement to a line that is otherwise very musky, and has become my daily favorite.</li>
      <li>This deodorant can work for men or women because of the unique smell.</li>
      <li>In my case, I find this deodorant does a sufficient job of controlling perspiration and my underarm sweat is significantly reduced throughout the day, despite this product not containing any aluminum compounds.</li>
      <li>it smells pretty good and my lady likes the new change from axe.</li>
      <li>She was right!</li>
      <li>Bought my boyfriend this kind old spice wolf thorn.  </li>
      <li>This scent is very gender neutral to me, and I absolutely love this formula.</li>
      <li>I am hooked on this scent, I also use the wolfthorn body wash and shampoo, they are not as sweet smelling as the deodorant.</li>
      <li>I wonder if that&#x27;s why I love it so much.</li>
      <li>It smells WAY too sweet.  </li>
      <li>It smells like a tangerine, but it&#x27;s not overpoweringly sweet or perfumey.</li>
      <li>I am one who have a sweet tooth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Smells way too sweet for me when compared to its body spray.</li>
      <li>This is by far the most delicious scent Old Spice is working with, it smells like SweetTarts, which is never a bad thing, as smelling like candy only makes people want to eat your face.</li>
      <li>The scent is nice but a little on the fruity-berry side, the longevity is pretty good.</li>
      <li>Then I ordered a 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly mild, and not so powerful as to irritate those nearby, but it is a unique scent that I and my girlfriend like.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>However, I find that having a deodorant that makes my arm pits smell somewhat like a Nerds Rope more than makes up for the uncomfortable wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between smelling like a chocolate bar (Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter body lotion) and having candy arm pits, I end up smelling delicious.</li>
      <li>but when I saw this at the grocery store I gave it a quick sniff and decided to give it a shot.</li>
      <li>I sweat easily, and figured something formulated for the big, sweaty powerhouses guys can be would be better suited for my underarms than the Sugar Dusted Sweet Flowers on a Bed of Kittens types of deodorant that are marketed at my gender.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> As George Carlin once said, too many men try to smell like a darn pine tree (paraphrasing). Personally, I agree with that statement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great alternative</li>
    <li> Awesome smell! Girls love the smell of it too</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice&#x27;s Matterhorn scent for several years but when I saw this at the grocery store I gave it a quick sniff and decided to give it a shot. Once I started wearing it, though, I realized it smells exactly like Tropical Punch Kool-Aid. Haha! I&#x27;m surprisingly fine with that, every time I catch the scent I can&#x27;t help but smile and it puts me in a good mood. It&#x27;s a welcome addition amongst all the sandalwood, smoky, scents that most men&#x27;s deodorants are known for.</li>
    <li> As much as the scent it nice it doesn&#x27;t really perform like the original Old Spice deodorants do, granted I am in an evironment where I&#x27;m sweating 85% of my work day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Old Spice for the past 2 years and I have tried an old scent I have always used, and this new scent here, and they both burn the hell out of my armpits. They must have made a recent change to all of their deodorants that now give me an allergic reaction. I know it&#x27;s just them because I switched to Axe and have ZERO burns, then tried Old Spice again after and got burns again. Bull..</li>
    <li> I still use this deodorant till this day the smell literally smells like orange soda. I wonder if that&#x27;s why I love it so much.</li>
    <li> smells like straight up jolly ranchers. works though</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this in the mail. Even FREE did not make this deodorant acceptable. I used it once hoping the very strong Koolaide scent would change later in the day. It did not. Unless you enjoy snorting concentrated powdered fruit punch drink mix all day long, you should avoid this deodorant. I am honestly stunned this made it to market. Am I part of some huge marketing joke?</li>
    <li> reminds me of oranges/citrtus super dope another good alt to the og spice. this and hawkridge are my jam! too bad foxcrest is so expensive</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, women love this deodorant.. can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores any longer.. really a shame</li>
    <li> Smells kinda like Baja Blast Mt. Dew. That sounds worse then when I said it in my head, but i&#x27;m still a fan either way.</li>
    <li> Good price on a hard to find pit stick for me. where I shop they only have this scent in antiperspirant and not in deodorant form which I prefer. A very good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> Earlier this month, I was looking to transition from antiperspirants as for one reason or another, I actually found they made me sweat more. When I saw Old Spice had a line products that were simply deodorants, I decided to give it a try. Two things drew me to Old Spice Wolfthorn. Of course, there was the awesome label. Second was the smell. As other reviews have mentioned, the Wolfthorn scent smells like candy. Specifically, a blueberry or raspberry candy. While this may not be every person&#x27;s cup of tea, I think it is one of the best smelling products I have ever used. As for performance, I simply put a couple of swipes under each arm in the morning and at the end of the day, I can still only smell the sweet smell of this deodorant. Not a hint of undesirable odor to be detected. In my case, I find this deodorant does a sufficient job of controlling perspiration and my underarm sweat is significantly reduced throughout the day, despite this product not containing any aluminum compounds. I think Old Spice is really on to something great here, and I look forward to making this my main deodorant for a good while.</li>
    <li> I am one who have a sweet tooth.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes me want to eat out my armpits.&lt;br /&gt;Imagine, Gummy Candy but sweeter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is all.</li>
    <li> HA!  This stuff smells GREAT.  The naming is great and the marketing on the label is pretty awesome.  I like that its a everyday product and they make it fun with the scent names!!!</li>
    <li> Wolfthorn smells way too much like fruit roll-ups. Usually, I take a sniff of the deodorant before I perchase it, but I haven&#x27;t had a rough time with Old Spice in the past, so I figure I&#x27;d trust them. Well, Old Spice broke my trust. They completely destroyed it. I figured with a name like Wolfthorn, the sent would be sharp, slightly musky, and moderately cool. I expected the scent to be more sophisticated. Instead, it smells like I had an accident in a Fruit Roll-Up factory. I smell like a little kid who ate too much candy. It doesn&#x27;t truly matter that much, but as a 20-something college student, this is not what I&#x27;m looking for...just heads up, don&#x27;t be mislead by the name. Take a sniff of that stuff first.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and works well, too!</li>
    <li> This deodorant can work for men or women because of the unique smell. The smell is a little more on the feminine side compared to Old Spice&#x27;s other deodorant options such as Fresh, or Pure Sport.</li>
    <li> Bought my boyfriend this kind old spice wolf thorn.  Let&#x27;s just say I used of all the smell of it is amazing i love it</li>
    <li> It makes me not smell bad... That&#x27;s more difficult than you would think.</li>
    <li> I actually looked this up as a lark because I was curious as to whether anyone else thought it smelled just like Cherry Koolaid.  The stuff works fine, so it gets three stars, but the smell is bizarre and kind of off-putting.</li>
    <li> Old Spice is great as always and this wolfthorn scent smells like candy!</li>
    <li> I was pretty impressed with the aroma of the old spice wolfthorn scent. i will buy more. it smells pretty good and my lady likes the new change from axe.</li>
    <li> Love the candy like smell and my wife digs it as well. The deodorant lasts throughout the entire day. Love it!!!</li>
    <li> I am quite happy to report that after receiving a free package of this in the mail a couple of weeks ago, I have not been bitten by a single werewolf. Great product!</li>
    <li> Smells great. This is my favorite scent from old spice at the moment. Chicks dig it and it won&#x27;t leave you smelling like a french whore. I don&#x27;t always buy Old Spice, But when I do I buy Old Spice Wild Collection. -Simple Man</li>
    <li> Odd texture, but very effective.</li>
    <li> The smell was pretty nice, but after about a week of using it, I developed an allergic reaction. I&#x27;ve used other Old Spice deodorants and not had this problem before, actually never had this problem with any other deodorant.</li>
    <li> This one is wonderful to me!  Overly powerful deodorants on my husband just don&#x27;t work. Even at the end of the day, he still smells good!  My two sons love it as well!</li>
    <li> Its a amazing fragrancy, citric and sweet, durable all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought 5.&lt;br /&gt;Its the best deodorant That I have used.</li>
    <li> Best Pit Stick on planet earth!!!!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected and I should have smelled it first.  With a name like wolfthorn I felt safe expecting something with earth tones and with a musk base but this smells like jucie fruity with a hint of coconut.  The label should have palm trees and passion fruit on it not wolves and thorns (who matches the smells with the labels....do they still have a job?) and from my experence and based on some of the other reviews it should be placed in a unisex section on the old spice rack.</li>
    <li> I only bought this because of the wacky pictures on the deodorant. I believe it works. My husband doesn&#x27;t stink.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always preferred men&#x27;s deodorant over the flowery &amp; powdery girly scents.&lt;br /&gt;This particular deodorant has changed my life!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unisex if ya ask me! It makes guys and gals smell like fresh, icy Kool-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!!!! Superior product!!</li>
    <li> ....or any other precious metal at that.  Maybe grapefruit chunks if anything, because that is what applying this to your underarms will make you crave all day.  Seriously, I want grapefruit right now.  Part of me wants to taste it because it smells so edible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not really a fan of smelling like this, it&#x27;s a little too feminine for me - I&#x27;ll stick to the sport deodorant rather than this one.</li>
    <li> So, yes, candy, delicious and sweet. If you&#x27;re a guy who loves the smell of Axe and the overly musky/peppery/strong/stereotypical masculine scents out there you&#x27;re going to hate this. But as someone who can&#x27;t stand the overpowering &#x27;manly&#x27; fragrances (that have forever been the only option) this stuff is perfect. It&#x27;s sweet and subtle and not like any other men&#x27;s product out there. I&#x27;m just glad that Old Spice is giving us some new scent choices and hopefully this one will stick around for a while. Definitely make sure you smell it first to see if it fits you. As for the product, it&#x27;s on par with every other Old Spice deodorant in that it does the job well and keeps you from smelling bad all day, no issue there. Give it a try if you&#x27;re sick of the other scents out there.</li>
    <li> I am a sucker for wolves. Ever since I was little they&#x27;ve been my absolute favorite animal, and remain so to this day. I&#x27;ve been debating trying men&#x27;s deodorant for a while. I sweat easily, and figured something formulated for the big, sweaty powerhouses guys can be would be better suited for my underarms than the Sugar Dusted Sweet Flowers on a Bed of Kittens types of deodorant that are marketed at my gender. Plus, Wolfthorn just sounded too cool not to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an Old Spice deodorant, this one is a little bit on the sweeter side. It&#x27;s still gender neutral; I personally prefer this to the typical signature Old Spice style of scent. I hope they keep this collection around for a while, I know I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it.</li>
    <li> Love this scent on my husband. He really likes it because it is invisible and the scent lasts ALL day! It doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t stain his shirts. Lasts a month because we are on the Amazon subscription plan with this product. I suspect come summer, it will go a little more quickly.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve probably seen the commercials by now.  An attractive woman gets swept off her feet by a dangerous, yet dashing, James Bond-type who happens to be surrounded by wolves.  It&#x27;s like an absurdist take on the recent Heineken commercials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, you&#x27;re more likely to be surrounded by honey bees than wolves with this scent, which really does smell like candy.  To me, it is reminiscent of a blue Sweet Tart or some kind of Kool-Aid.  That&#x27;s not to say that it&#x27;s unpleasant, because it actually is a somewhat charming scent.  I bought the deodorant based on how much I liked the cologne of the same name, which to me does not have that same sugary smell.  The cologne is a little more crisp and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe put out a deodorant recently that smelled like chocolate mixed with coconut, so I guess this a new trend. Just know that Wolfthorn is neither wolfish or thorny.  If you&#x27;re looking for a rugged, manly scent, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> OK,maybe it&#x27;s weird to review a deodorant, but I really love the scent, which is why I bought 6 at a time.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s favourite of the Old Spice range.  He would have preferred it to have anti persperant also but happy I bought all the way from US to UK as we do not have it here</li>
    <li> I love the way my husband smells when he wears this!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s designed for men, but I use it as a woman. It smells like candy, something like Skittles.</li>
    <li> Great scented deodorant; Old Spice has come a long way with there line of new products; from body washes / sprays / deodorants; I am sure you to will find a scent / kind for you!</li>
    <li> First I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;ve worn Old Spice since it&#x27;s since I was preteen and I&#x27;m loyal to Old Spice as a consumer. Don&#x27;t get me wrong either Wolfthorn smells great I use the deodorant and the showergel. But as far as 24 hour protection goes, I think I may switch back to Pure Sport because when come to being a actual sweat protection it doesn&#x27;t perform as well. And on an actual deodorant level, it maybe last 6 hours before having to reapplied. All in all I&#x27;ll definitely keep wearing it out at night. But during the day in South Florida sun during physical labor or working out I&#x27;ll stick to Pure Sport.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this, yes, i too was a victim of their clever marketing. The scent is nice but a little on the fruity-berry side, the longevity is pretty good. I won&#x27;t buy it again but i would recommend it to someone looking for a deodorant with a fruity scent that really lasts.</li>
    <li> Smells very good. Lasts all day. Goes on smooth, not sticky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to preface my review by saying that I&#x27;m not a man. Like, at all. Not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this new scent. It&#x27;s light and fruity, kind of like Clinique Happy. It smells like a tangerine, but it&#x27;s not overpoweringly sweet or perfumey. It&#x27;s sheer-- not sticky or slimy or gooey at all-- but it still works a lot longer than most deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, this is lady deodorant-- a fantastic lady deodorant at that. I don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s marketed for men. If I were rating this as a men&#x27;s deodorant, though, I&#x27;d give it a three because it&#x27;s such a feminine scent.</li>
    <li> Love the new scents by old spice. No complaints. Took awhile to get here, but still. Came with a big package and all kinds of packing peanuts. Which seemed kinda silly, but at least it shows they care about getting the stuff there without harm, eh?</li>
    <li> The best way I can describe the scent of this deodorant is \\&quot;grapefruit Jolly Rancher,\\&quot; which is not what people usually think of when they think of Old Spice. Based on the other reviews, it&#x27;s obvious that plenty of people like this, but it&#x27;s just not for me. My go-to choice is their \\&quot;[[ASIN:B008HQ8M0Y Swagger]]\\&quot; scent, which is more classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it smells better than I usually do, so I&#x27;ll use it up, but I certainly won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Smells way too sweet for me when compared to its body spray. Still preferred the smell from the body spray</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in the mail, and tried it for a week. Then I ordered a 3-pack.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly mild, and not so powerful as to irritate those nearby, but it is a unique scent that I and my girlfriend like.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest advantage to me was that this is one of the very few underarm products that does NOT cause my skin to get red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Bought for my wife, loves the scent</li>
    <li> I wanted an aluminum free deodorant, and my sister suggested this. She was right! This should be renamed tropical paradise.</li>
    <li> Wolfthorn smells exactly like gummy worms.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I have no complaints cuz I fackin love candy.&lt;br /&gt;Its about time a deodorant company came up with a tasty man scent. Up until now, all I had to fall back on was Old Spice: Fiji&lt;br /&gt;I hope they come out with more REALWORLD scents like sour patch kids or orange sherbet or even Red Kool aid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LJBonilla</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything too bad, I just don&#x27;t like the gel style / blue deodorant, I always feel wet, and I need to be dry.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most delicious scent Old Spice is working with, it smells like SweetTarts, which is never a bad thing, as smelling like candy only makes people want to eat your face. Each time I wear it, I feel that it is the closest I&#x27;ve ever been to royalty. The deodorant is great as it doesn&#x27;t cake up in your armpit (the worst thing ever), and if you have sensitive skin (which I do) it doesn&#x27;t irritate and feels mild. Even by the end of an 8 hour work day, the pits still feel dry. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite deodorants.  It has a pleasant but not over-powering scent.  For times when I&#x27;m outdoors and can&#x27;t shower for an extended period of time, this stuff holds up well.  During a recent backpacking trip I didn&#x27;t shower for 24 hours and it was still working quite well.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. It smells WAY too sweet.  Imagine eating a bag of skittles on an empty stomach and vomiting nothing but bile and half digested skittles...you have Old Spice Wolfthorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this to be funny, this stuff is terrible. If you don&#x27;t believe me then at least buy it from the supermarket and smell it first. I&#x27;m fine with the rest of the Old Spice line but I couldn&#x27;t finish a stick of this stuff. I Picked up a stick of lionpride and it&#x27;s way better. I&#x27;ve smelled the one with the birds on it and it smells pretty good to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it works as deodorant. But it really does smell god awful. The smell almost gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like blue Kool-Aid. Love it. The anti-perspirant protection is reasonably good for this price point.</li>
    <li> I bought this because they were out of my usual deodorant (swagger) and I thought to myself, \\&quot;wolves? Good. Thorns? Good.\\&quot; This smells like neither wolves nor thorns. I expected perhaps a spruce or pine scent.    This smells like fruit stripe gum...which is just not a good scent for a guy.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is awesome, I love the scent (I used to use old spice sport). I am always getting comments on how good I smell, I was told yesterday that I smelled delicious by a girl standing behind me in line at starbucks, had to share that lol, The scent is a bit sweet at first, switching from sport, but I got used to it in a couple days. There was no irritation when I switched which you know sucks when changing deodorants. I am hooked on this scent, I also use the wolfthorn body wash and shampoo, they are not as sweet smelling as the deodorant.</li>
    <li> You won&#x27;t find a better deal in stores</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent from Old Spice. It&#x27;s somewhat sweet and lasts for a long time, so I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I ended up picking up this deodorant because it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels wet/sticky when you apply it so the two routes to go are to either continue getting dressed and ignore it, or stand there with your arms held out at your sides as if you&#x27;re imitating an airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you sweat like a beast, you might find the ridiculous amount of moisture you end up experiencing between the application of the deodorant and your sweat to be unbearable. However, I find that having a deodorant that makes my arm pits smell somewhat like a Nerds Rope more than makes up for the uncomfortable wetness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between smelling like a chocolate bar (Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter body lotion) and having candy arm pits, I end up smelling delicious. I&#x27;m okay with this.</li>
    <li> Smells Great! My girlfriend loves it.</li>
    <li> This scent is very gender neutral to me, and I absolutely love this formula. I am a female but I have never found a deodorant only formula for women that works. I avoid the aluminum in antiperspirant formulas and this is aluminum free.  This works so well and the scent is so pleasant and mild, I hope they never stop making it, is the best.</li>
    <li> YouTube is all abuzz about this deoderant for use by women. I decided to give it a try and OMG!!!! This smells like the finest Victorias Secret fragrance ever! It also has the added benefit of WORKING!!! I soooooooo hope they don&#x27;t discontinue or change the scent. I just love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Wolfthorn is part of Old Spice&#x27;s newest marketing ploy to make over-the-top commercials peddling smaller deodorants.  Wolfthorn is the update to Old Spice&#x27;s discontinued [[ASIN:B000V3IKEE Pacific Surge]], and replaces PacSurge&#x27;s lighter water lily foundation with a strong juniper scent, which has the effect of making Wolfthorn smell like a bag of jelly beans with a light citrus undertone.  It also makes Wolfthorn a more unisex scent, like comparable competitors [[ASIN:B0020MM7UC Escape]] or [[ASIN:B0012RT8X0 Very Cool]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have other Old Spice deodorants in your cabinet, you will immediately notice that, despite being the same size, the Wild Collection deodorants are 3oz instead of the usual 3.75 to 4.25oz.  While I know this irks some people, it doesn&#x27;t bother me because the scent is one of the stronger Old Spice fragrances and requires less used to get great results than some [[ASIN:B0017WKFQE previous incarnations]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m curious to see if Old Spice&#x27;s foray into the world of [[ASIN:B001ECQ4V2 Axe]] marketing will stick, Wolfthorne is a great supplement to a line that is otherwise very musky, and has become my daily favorite.</li>
    <li> Great smell! Love that it&#x27;s just a deodorant and not an antiperspirant</li>
    <li> makes you smell delicious. This deodorant is awesome. People often ask me if Im wearing colone when I wear this. It works even through the most strenuous of physical activity.</li>
    <li> smells like wolf poop berries.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it would smell exactly like the Anti-perspirant with the same exact name. It smells a little more sour (not as sweet) and it comes in blue instead of white.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  Kind of fruity/citrus. Love it!</li>
    <li> love this smell, drives the strippers/girls wild cause its slightly fruity</li>
</ol>
