<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this atomizer for two years.  It works well, is easy to refill, has a nice spray, and is nicely finished.</li>
    <li> The only reason I am giving 2 stars is the picture is deceiving. It seems like a decent product, but read carefully. The picture shows 2 bottles, but you only get one. I would have gone for something less expensive if I had realized that althought he picture shows 2 bottles you are just getting one bottle- now I need another bottle for my project.</li>
    <li> Creates a great misty spray, but the pump inexplicably stopped working after about two months of light use. Don&#x27;t really know how that happened ... it just sits on my dresser. Also, I noticed some leakage, even with the top screwed on tight. My bottle would be coated in a thin layer of cologne after usage. That wasn&#x27;t really a big deal, but now that it has ceased to work completely, I&#x27;ll have to find a replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this to refill my Travalo atomizer, since my perfume&#x27;s new package design is incompatible with it. The nozzle on this little bottle barely fits the Travalo, leaving puddles of perfume nearly everywhere *but* the atomizer. I realize this is a very specific use case, though -- I have no use for this little bottle now, but it seems like a good product for people who are looking for a smaller bottle to use for traveling.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent atomizer and works great with a fine mist spray.  The seal is air tight and does not leak in your luggage or travel bag.  It also came with a pipette and funnel, which were not mentioned in the listing.  They also work very well.  Excellent quality!</li>
    <li> This solved my problem of a perfume bottle that would no longer squirt. Nice product, no problems.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed when the pump on my original bottle broke. Plus it&#x27;s refillable!  Great price!</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> ...for my VS perfumes who&#x27;s atomizers gave out. They just don&#x27;t smell the same when dabbed on, I swear! And the slender design doesn&#x27;t take up much counter room on the vanity.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed and the seal of the bottle is great!!!! Ship was fast as well. Will use it for my special buy refills.</li>
    <li> i spent a lot of money on the perfume i put in this bottle. unfortunately, it all leaked when i brought it to travel.</li>
    <li> I really needed this due to the fact my perfume bottle wasn&#x27;t spraying properly any longer. This bottle was perfect in every way EXCEPT the sprayer wouldn&#x27;t spray either!!  Money wasted</li>
    <li> I have a unique use-case for this. I put absinthe in this bottle and spray my old-fashioned glass when making a Sazerac. Works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never bought an empty perfume bottle before but this one was great! Easy to fill. The glass feels nice and thick. Spray was perfect! Never leaked.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this to put in my purse but found it a little to large for that but looks very nice on bathroom counter</li>
    <li> According to the image the little tube that sucks up the liquid is plenty long enough to reach the bottom of the well. Mine is short more than 1 1/2 inches. That&#x27;s right, in order to use it I would have to waste a good quantity of cologne to just engage the tube. Who thought this was a good idea?</li>
    <li> We got this for my wife&#x27;s perfume which she dropped and broke the sprayer. The sprayer on this one stopped working after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> Now I can fill this with the cologne my husband gave me in a 30 oz. bottle!</li>
    <li> I put my home made perfume in the bottle and it works great. Really good quality and great spray.</li>
    <li> Got this for my wife. I bought her some perfume but as a clueless man buying perfume I got a refill bottle.  She was skeptical when I said I purchased this.  But tried it out and said it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> These glass bottles are huge! Exactly what I wanted for my perfume oils. I will be buying these again as I add to my collection. The pumps seem to handle the heavy oil without an issue, they feel of quality and they do not feel cheap.</li>
    <li> It sprayed like a perfume bottle for like a minute before it just turned into a stream line spray. It does not bother me but it might bother other people who buys this for their perfume and not diy projects like myself.</li>
    <li> This bottle is exactly what I was looking for.  The spray is very fine (although it does spray a lot, you&#x27;ve been warned).  I needed a new bottle because the pump broke on a very expensive bottle of perfume.  This did the trick.  It has a very tight seal too- I have had it for a couple of months and there hasn&#x27;t been any evaporation.</li>
    <li> I checked countless refillable atomizers before deciding on this one because: - Perfume is to be poured in rather than pumped in as i have an &amp;#34;eau de parfum&amp;#34; bottle that has a screw on cap rather than an atomizer. The ability to pour eliminated a lot of offers such as the Travalo products. In fact it is often unclear if a refillable atomizer accepts pour in. - The review were convincing.  The glass is sturdy and simple, the inside hose goes all the way to the end. The spray is misty. The silver cap and atomizer are not metal (the de facto standard nowadays) so we will see how the plastic coating handles over time though this is not a big problem for me because i will use this atomizer only on my trips and at home once a day in the privacy of my bathroom.  The product came with a funnel and a mesh pouch. I would have been happier with a product half the size but none were available so this is the best option for me and the product delivers as described. Also the delivery was fast from JJ Supplies Inc. I am very happy with my purchase. I hope it will hold well.</li>
    <li> This bottle is exactly what I was looking for.  I like to mix essential oils and various perfumes and the sprayer and size are great.  The included funnel makes it really easy to fill as well.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for my toiletry travel bag!  Looks elegant and so convenient! It took me a while try to fill it up since my perfume bottle doesn&#x27;t allow me to remove the pump to pour out the perfume.  I only filled it halfway because I got tired of literally spraying the perfume into the new bottle.</li>
    <li> ok but costs more than it should</li>
    <li> Beautiful bottle, beautiful packaging, swift shipping. Arrived in an organza bag, along with a small funnel for decanting; this was all packaged well for shipment. Nice thick, durable glass.</li>
    <li> great perfume bottle.  I love it</li>
    <li> Cool bottle. It looks sturdy. Only qualm is that it may fall  often as it is too long to sit on its base.</li>
    <li> Nice clear bottle. Perfect for perfume refills.</li>
    <li> I had some baby perfume in a bottle for my daughter (who is no longer a baby) and she loves the scent.  It makes her feel grown up to wear perfume :-)  The problem was that the perfume was not in a spray bottle, just a regular bottle, and if she would try to put it on by herself she would need to take a shower b/c she just reeked of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I got this bottle to see if having her spray a little perfume would give her the independence to do it for herself, but not overdo it.  It works beautifully.  If she wants to wear her grown-up (baby) perfume, she&#x27;s allowed to do ONE spritz.  Now she can put on her own perfume and the rest of can still breathe!</li>
    <li> A little more than I wanted to spend but was easy to fill and works very well! Would buy again if this one quits working!</li>
    <li> Good purchase to use up cologne from a bottle with a busted sprayer</li>
    <li> i absolutely love this bottle it feels nice , works nice and looks expensive believe it or not. yo yo</li>
    <li> I like the look and the fact that this is glass. I bought it to use for an airplane approved travel size for my organic rose facial spray. In trying to keep things healthy, I wanted to avoid a plastic sprayer. The bottle itself is quality but the spray mist that comes out is a little harsh and I wish it sprayed softer. It also shoots out too much at a time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because one of my more expensive spay bottles broke and would not spay right. Best of all, it is reusable!</li>
    <li> My grandfather wanted to fill two smaller bottles with cologne from the one large bottle he purchased- so hard to find a decent bottle!  This one is perfect, and even comes with a little funnel.  The top closes tightly, no leaks, and the spray is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I have an expensive perfume that unexpectedly came in a splash bottle. I transferred most of it to this bottle and put it in my purse. It is absolutely sealed and has not leaked and it has a wonderful spray. Thanks for the great product!</li>
    <li> I love these!  They allow me to mix my own fragrance using essential oils and vodka.  My fave smells pretty close to Amazing Grace.  Love it!!!  The bottles always spray beautifully and don&#x27;t clog.  Really pretty too.  Nice and heavy / thick glass.  No falling over.</li>
    <li> Great quality glass, great sprayer, but I did not receive my funnel. Overall great product</li>
    <li> I LOVE TO MAKE MY OWN LIP GLOSS, AND ESSENTIAL OILS AND THIS LITTLE BOTTLES ARE NOT FOR WHAT I DO.THEY LEAK VERY BAD</li>
    <li> This bottle is easy to fill and sprays beautifully.  Highly recommended if you have some cologne in a &amp;#34;splash&amp;#34; type container which you prefer to spray!</li>
    <li> Works perfect! Sprays a very fine mist just like I would expect. I don&#x27;t have any complaints. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I dropped my perfume bottle and broke the spritzer and this did the trick.  It was just the right size for the amount of perfume remaining, and the spritzer works just fine.  I&#x27;d &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; the product if it only less product came out with each spritz.  Otherwise, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Perfect for travel size through airports and sturdy and strong.  Shipped quick~  Would have like to have received the cologne  &#x27;funnels&#x27; other customers received, but oh well.</li>
    <li> Good size, and the straw does go all the way to the bottom of the glass container. This is important so that you can use up the last of the perfume in the bottom.  Does not come with a funnel.</li>
    <li> Allowed me to use some cologne that was in less favorable containers,&lt;br /&gt;which otherwise would have probably gone to waste.</li>
    <li> I love it even though it was a little bigger than I expected!  The glass is thick and the sprayer seems sturdy.  I would buy this again and probably will.</li>
    <li> My cologne bottle broke, and it was an expensive bottle and practically full to boot. Bought this to use in its place and it works great. It does put out a very fine mist. One thing I have noticed is that sometime gets stuck sort of speak and have to push down hard, but once it clears, it works fine. I alson love the shape of the bottle.</li>
    <li> The spray potion of this container is not top notch but it works fairly well. It looks and feels classy even if the amount per spray is a bit inconsistent</li>
    <li> Perfect if you need a different sprayer</li>
    <li> Very nice. Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I got this to use for a bottle of cologne that came with just a stopper, because my boyfriend uses it less frequently than his fragrances with atomizer bottles. The bottle itself is nice and sturdy, and looks just like the picture. We didn&#x27;t use a funnel or anything, because the openings on both the old bottle and this one were wide enough to allow easy pouring between them. And the mist was fine enough to replicate his other fragrances that came with atomizers, and now he uses that scent way more frequently.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and practical, yet a well made small carry on bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not hesitate ro recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> fast service. was a gift but i liked the looks of it.  looked easy to use.  funnel included which wasn&#x27;t mentioned in description</li>
    <li> loved the atomizer at first however one morning, after it worked beautifully &amp; daily for 4 weeks, it just quit working - pump wouldn&#x27;t go down - seemed &#x27;stuck&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I have several splash bottles of men&#x27;s cologne, and I needed a decent spray bottle to pour them into.  This bottle is well-made, with heavy glass, and has a powerful sprayer.  (Go easy on the trigger, because this sprayer puts out a huge fine mist -- you could wash windows with it!)  Bottles like this are hard to find in stores nowadays, so I was happy to find this here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I can only find the splash cologne for my dad so I found this and it works great.  He hasn&#x27;t had any issues yet and the little spout that comes with it is great to have.</li>
    <li> This is a great quality product. It&#x27;s sturdy, made well, and is just the right size fro my hand. Love it!</li>
    <li> I plan to use these to store hundreds of sample perfumes into one place.  Have not yet done so, so cannot speak to the efficacy of my plan.  However, the company was cordial, swift with delivery and the box in which they came included tiny funnels and droppers, items I hadn&#x27;t thought to get separately.  I really appreciate their (the company&#x27;s) thoughtfulness.  And, all looks sleek and able to fulfill my task at hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WB</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t you just love it when a product exceeds your expectations?  Not only is this bottle well designed and made, but I really appreciated the included squeeze bulb pipette for transferring. Like a previous reviewer, I had a broken spritzer on a nonrefillable bottle of juice and attempts to fill smaller bottles using a funnel resulted in spills.  The bottle has substance - a good weight and thickness. The spritzer screws securely onto the bottle with no leaking and provides a even wide spray. I would love to know if the smaller purse size bottles sold by this vender are of the same fine quality.</li>
    <li> I convinced my brother to try the \\&quot;fancy new\\&quot; cologne I just purchased.  Because of the professional appearance of this bottle, it helped sell the prank.  I won&#x27;t say what was in the new cologne I&#x27;ll just hint that it was pee.  He&#x27;s still mad but he agrees it&#x27;s a FINE bottle!!</li>
    <li> This is working great for me. I had a cologne that had no spray and now it does thanks to this. It&#x27;s glass and it looks good with the rest of the cologne collection.</li>
    <li> Bought this for the eco refills of Mugler Cologne. Very nice bottle and great sprayer.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality, size and sleek fancy look for an affordable price. I would highly recommend it. It&#x27;s also a good travel size and would fit easily in your purse. Practically, it&#x27;s the size if a perfume rollerball but it&#x27;s spray rather the applying it to the touch. It also comes within a cute duffle bag and a tiny funnel to help pour in your liquid/solution or parfum.</li>
    <li> Essential oil perfume works well in these bottles.</li>
    <li> Great for what i was looking for</li>
    <li> This works perfectly as a new vessel for my favorite scent. It was simple to transfer my perfume from a leaking bottle to this replacement. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it spraying &amp;#34;too much&amp;#34;, as other reviewers have claimed. I suppose it depends on the atomizer you wind up with. If I ever need another replacement-this would be the one.</li>
