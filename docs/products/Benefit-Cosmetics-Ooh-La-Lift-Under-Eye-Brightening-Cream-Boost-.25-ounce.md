      <li>, I&#x27;m just glad to find something that works so well!</li>
      <li>I still do use an undereye concealer before applying this product, but it gives you a nice and awake look after use.  </li>
      <li>Since my teens I&#x27;ve been a black-eyeliner-on-the-inner rim kind of gal.  </li>
      <li>I got this because I love the mascara by Benefit (they&#x27;re real) &amp; thought that it would be just as wonderful!</li>
      <li>It is great for a quick eye pick me up.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use</li>
      <li>I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
      <li>i have very light skin, so</li>
      <li>This product is just okay as an under eye brightened.</li>
      <li>Maybe I need to give it more of a chance, but I noticed I had to apply a lot more than it said before I saw a difference.</li>
      <li>I love this under eye concealer because it doesn&#x27;t crease, and it is creamy.  </li>
      <li>I love this product for days I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation.</li>
      <li>Okay...</li>
      <li>Make sure to moisturize before applying.  </li>
      <li>and I love them.</li>
      <li>Glad I ordered it and it might be better in the Spring.</li>
      <li>I have to use a bit more than the directions say.</li>
      <li>What I love about Ooh</li>
      <li>So I bought one from Sephora and I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found &amp; I will definitely be keeping a tube of this stuff in my make-up bag from now on:-)</li>
      <li>I normally love all Benefit products but for whatever reason, this one didn&#x27;t agree with me.  </li>
      <li>Love this,,, been using it for years and have turned all my friends onto it,,,,,can&#x27;t be without it</li>
      <li>Still, a lovely result &amp;it may look better to others.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many things under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This product is not a miracle, but it can moisture and brighter the eye area and make you look more rested and with brighter eyes.  </li>
      <li>The box and the tube inside just doesn&#x27;t feel like an authentic Benefit&#x27;s product.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s feels cool and nice to apply.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Benefit Eye Bright Pencil, which I don&#x27;t care for as much --  </li>
      <li>Some mornings it takes more product than others depending on the degree of dark circles but this is very effective!</li>
      <li>When putting it under my eyes as instructed, it has a very nice pink/white tone, then once it dries it disappears completely.</li>
      <li>white eye shadow does just as good as job!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to apply and works wonders on my appearance, and it doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.</li>
      <li>Ooh La Lift works superbly under the eyes for dark circles.  </li>
      <li>Plumps up the fine lines</li>
      <li>This brightener is fantastic.</li>
      <li>but I do when my eyes are especially wrinkly and it works great at taking wrinkles away..</li>
      <li>It reflects light and gives a smooth appearance.  </li>
      <li>It also has a nice, gentle tingle to it, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes</li>
      <li>The cooling is actually slightly negative for me, but I think most people would find it pleasant and effective.</li>
      <li>Just wanted to give an age reference if you&#x27;re wondering how good it does on different ages.</li>
      <li>This product has a pinkish tint that is very pretty.</li>
      <li>This product works great, conceals under eye circles and puffiness, I use it under regular foundation, it reflects light and moisturizes wrinkles, i feel no need to use under eye concealer when using this product, just a regular light foundation.</li>
      <li>I tried the Benefit brightening stick, Eye Bright, but found it too dry.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty, a tiny bit shimmery and love to use this!</li>
      <li>Maybe someone else will discover the OOH LA out of it and get the LIFT they are looking for, but not this 44 year old! :)</li>
      <li>I find that it makes a huge difference, and really brightens up my face by disguising my under eye circles.  </li>
      <li>the price tag if you want to look fresh and relaxed.</li>
      <li>But I think it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>My mom, who is in her early 50&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t as pleased with the results of using this brightener, but she did say that it is somewhat helpful.</li>
      <li>Seriously, it is SO worth</li>
      <li>This is pretty cool stuff......</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
      <li>skin tone is fair with pink undertones.  </li>
      <li>Nice stuff but not enough coverage for my age (63).  </li>
      <li>Just right for someone with aging skin.</li>
      <li>My under-eye area is just a tad sunken, and this does lift the area just right.</li>
      <li>eye cream right now,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not so sure this gives it a lift, but it definitely improves the look of bags &amp; under eye circles.</li>
      <li>It looks kind of pink?</li>
      <li>well first,</li>
      <li>It makes one feel better and younger.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works!</li>
      <li>Benefit never fails me.</li>
      <li>Kinda made them more noticeable, actually.  </li>
      <li>I love that it seems to last all day, as well.</li>
      <li>So i put the Ooh La Lift on first and then a concealer.</li>
      <li>but Ooh la lift isn&#x27;t consistent and</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different concealers over the years and nothing comes close to Ooh la lift!</li>
      <li>The first time I purchased it from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Easy, simple, fast!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> In all honesty - I have not noticed anything different using this product. I figure it probably offers some smoothing of lines - so I continue using it in hopes it&#x27;s doing that... but for the price - do not think I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product, was recommended to me by a friend and it works wonderfully! Helps take away under eye puffyiness and works to brighten eyes!! I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
    <li> Vey good, but  the texture is a bit lighter than I expected - I need to put quite a thick layer to cover the dark circles.</li>
    <li> The product I received is not from benefit cosmetics. I used this product as directed. My eyes are now puffy and oily. I&#x27;ve used the product several times and It looks like too old.So I wouldn&#x27;t purchase from this seller</li>
    <li> For the price I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I don&#x27;t really have bad under eye problems but just wanted something to lighten the area and make it stand out more and it coulnt really even do that. I cant imagine it helping if you were trying to  cover up dark circles or something.</li>
    <li> I tried the Benefit brightening stick, Eye Bright, but found it too dry.  It had to be smudged HARD, even with moisturizer under it.  But this product goes on well.  It does take some practice to get the level of coverage you want.  But I think it is worth the price. even though I wish it were less.  I have 3 now: 1 for home, 1 for makeup bag, and one back-up.  I recommend not using it over moisturizer, or at least blotting well first, but that is your choice.</li>
    <li> Good product. Excellent Job.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! I am very pale and I just had a baby.and not getting much sleep these days. I&#x27;ve got really dark circles under my eyes and bags. NO amount of concealer is covering It. But this stuff wow!!! It really lightens my dark circles and I can actually get away with just this and no other makeup and I don&#x27;t scare everybody. ALSO I don&#x27;t know if this seller does this with everyone  but I was VERY excited to find two little freebies that came with it and I love them. I will definitely buy from them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of under-eye concealers, and products purporting to reduce puffiness, but the Ooh La Lift is a winner for me.  I find that it makes a huge difference, and really brightens up my face by disguising my under eye circles.  It also has a nice, gentle tingle to it, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes (I wear contact and have had issues with heavier cream concealers).    My only caveat would be that I don&#x27;t wear foundation/concealer , so I&#x27;m using this produce on and next to bare skin.  If you&#x27;re looking for something to completely conceal circles, you&#x27;ll need something heavier.</li>
    <li> A few years back I went to a Sephora store and went through the whole makeover routine. Out of all the products the makeup artist used on my face, this is one of only four that I continue to purchase. She dotted this under my eyes, along with a light strip of concealer and gently mixed it together. Talk about a difference! Puffiness is gone. As are any signs of sleepless nights.     I truly hope they never discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I was skeptical when I saw it, but it definitely perks up the eye area.  I still do use an undereye concealer before applying this product, but it gives you a nice and awake look after use.  I plan to make this a staple in my makeup bag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a long time. My normal M/O is to apply it later in the afternoon when I&#x27;m losing my morning-fresh makeup look and need just what the product implies: a lift! It&#x27;s feels cool and nice to apply. Just dab a few spots under your eyes (where dark circles may live) and then \\&quot;pat\\&quot; the product until it blends in. This definitely perks up your look. I always order a new tube before I run out, wouldn&#x27;t want to be without.</li>
    <li> I use a pink base eye concealer first &amp; then my regular skin color concealer.  Makes circles under eyes disappear .</li>
    <li> I have hereditary dark circles. This product has a pinkish tint that is very pretty. It has a very light weightless lotion-like texture comparable to a thick serum.  However, I don&#x27;t think it works so well. Certainly not worth anything over $20. I think I would just go with a concealer (if within the Benefit product line, Erase Paste or Boi-ing) and skip on the Ooh La Lift. If you don&#x27;t have any dark circles and just want a pinkish tint, I&#x27;m not even sure this product would do that much.</li>
    <li> I have olive/yellow tan skin. It looks kind of pink? on the wand, but when you put a few dots under your eyes, it blends into the nicest color of concealer. For my skin tone, I had to use a few more dots to cover the darker skin areas. It does NOT look like some ugly thicker or cheap concealer, like some do. I even use it in the little crevices on each side of my nose because it&#x27;s a bit dark there -- and this lightens it up really well. It&#x27;s a very pretty, a tiny bit shimmery and love to use this!</li>
    <li> I normally love all Benefit products but for whatever reason, this one didn&#x27;t agree with me.  It got gunky on my skin after a little bit &amp; didn&#x27;t make a difference in the appearance of my eyes.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is good, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is great. I have terrible bags under my eyes from a form of heredity. So i put the Ooh La Lift on first and then a concealer.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It has adds a very subtle brightness around my eyes without ever caking and make me look more awake and energized.  I don&#x27;t notice that it does any lifting at all, just brightening.  I just swoosh it on and tap it a little with my ring finger to spread it out; it doesn&#x27;t require careful blending as it&#x27;s quite sheer.  The only downside is that there&#x27;s not much in the tube and pretty soon I&#x27;m trying to scrape the applicator against the tube lining to get the last bits.  I&#x27;ve also used the Benefit Eye Bright Pencil, which I don&#x27;t care for as much --  it&#x27;s more obvious and requires more careful application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is fair with pink undertones.  I don&#x27;t think you could go wrong with Ooh La Lift if you&#x27;re a similar skin type.</li>
    <li> I was very excited upon receiving this item because of the great reviews it had. When putting it under my eyes as instructed, it has a very nice pink/white tone, then once it dries it disappears completely. I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t put enough on, so I put more on an hour later, and still no difference. It is a waste of money, if I would have known I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many things under my eyes. That is the absolute worse part about aging! I&#x27;m not so sure this gives it a lift, but it definitely improves the look of bags &amp; under eye circles. It doesn&#x27;t make the wrinkles under my eyes look worse like all the other cover-ups do. I have to use a bit more than the directions say. I put on 3 dabs, rub it in, then add another 3 dabs to cover the dark circles. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found &amp; I will definitely be keeping a tube of this stuff in my make-up bag from now on:-)</li>
    <li> What I love about Ooh la Lift is its moisturising ability. I apply Ooh la Lift before my concealer and I find that it stops my concealer from caking. To date, I haven&#x27;t found any other under-eye moisturiser that can stop concealer from caking and looking dry. It keeps the eye area hydrated all day. I think it&#x27;s a must if you wear under-eye concealer. I will continue to buy it.</li>
    <li> Some mornings it takes more product than others depending on the degree of dark circles but this is very effective!</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the real product. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same or look the same.  More white than pink. Currently burning my eyes.  :(</li>
    <li> Ooo lala oops! I thought I reviewed this GEM!  *****GREAT SELLER***GREAT TO WORK WITH****&lt;br /&gt;Loved the product, Benefit hit one out of the park again with this &amp;#34;OOH LA LIFT&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I use this before putting on undereye concealer and it&#x27;s amazing! Smooths little lines(39 yrs old)and makes the undereye area look glowy..and I also use it to freshen up my makeup later in the day..a must have for me!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my eyes when using this product.</li>
    <li> I do like this eye brightener. U just have to apply a bit of it, to get the brightening effect</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and am overjoyed that I can get it at such a fantastic price. I think some of the negative reviews are from those who don&#x27;t realize you&#x27;re supposed to put a concealer underneath it first.</li>
    <li> Awesome beauty product for sleep-deprived moms and workaholics! I use a little to make my eyes look a little fresher; often it&#x27;s enough just with a little mascara and \\&quot;that gal\\&quot; to make my face ready for the world.  Easy, simple, fast!</li>
    <li> As usual Benefit cosmetics deliver on their promises.  Ooh La Lift works superbly under the eyes for dark circles.  You can apply it and then apply Fake Up for complete dark circles lift.  It makes one feel better and younger.</li>
    <li> It actually is a little dry for me so I don&#x27;t use it every day but I do when my eyes are especially wrinkly and it works great at taking wrinkles away..</li>
    <li> I love this product for days I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation. I blend a swipe under each eye, forehead, and chin in order to create an even complexion in under a minute.</li>
    <li> If you have dark circles under your eyes or little lines this hides them all.  It reflects light and gives a smooth appearance.  Also stays on all day.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a thing! I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but at least a little something. I would not recommend this product anyone</li>
    <li> This was.my first purchase on amazon so when I received two shop worn boxes with used product I just threw it away gross!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this product. The first time I purchased it from Amazon. I was confused, because I kept having this issue where the product would look really...white. To the point where I would take a picture of myself wearing it to see how it looked under flash, and it would look kind of odd. It also smelled strange. That&#x27;s when I realized....the product I received was fake. So I bought one from Sephora and I absolutely love it. It smells sort of like raspberries and vanilla and goes on perfectly. It definitely brightens up the eye area and what I really love is that it moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t look too makeup-ey and unlike a concealer, its hard to screw up with this or end up looking like you have way too much makeup on (which seems to happen a lot with putting thick concealers under the eyes).</li>
    <li> Cant be without it!  I have naturally dark circles thanks to my genetics, but this makes the skin tone even!  I have tried so many different concealers over the years and nothing comes close to Ooh la lift!</li>
    <li> I use this daily, and then I also used to for concealer/brightener when I got a black eye, that dipped into the eye socket. I just looked at some pictures, and the bruising is hardly noticeable! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
    <li> NEVER ENDING COMPLIMENTS..IT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF MAKEUP</li>
    <li> I do not know what I did before I discovered Ooh La Lift.  This product completely birghtens and lightens my eyes.  I have always have dark circles under my eyes and this product seems to make them disappear!  Make sure to moisturize before applying.  You must try this product!</li>
    <li> this is inexpensive and does reduce the appearance of dark circles.  i have very light skin, so i do not know what it would look like on darker skin.  it&#x27;s pink so you figure it out</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years to lessen the dark circles around my eyes that I get from long stressful hours at the office.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to apply and works wonders on my appearance, and it doesn&#x27;t look like makeup.</li>
    <li> This product does lighten the bags under the eyes.  Puffiness seems to be less.</li>
    <li> Not too greasy and not too white!  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I watched &amp;#34;how to videos&amp;#34; on Benefit website, looked for tips on youtube but still not see any of the promises on my face. Helpless product, was waist of money for me. Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> Receieved  this item extremely fast. Opened it up, and the liquid was all over the tube and cover. Half of it was gone. A little upset about that part!  Almost seemed used.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much benefit from this product. It does add shimmer but there is no reduction in the appearance of my dark circles. It just looks like I rubbed glitter on them. I&#x27;m still on the hunt for a product that works...</li>
    <li> Love it! The only thing that not only masks, but treats as well! Thanks to the seller for the fast shipment</li>
    <li> Tried this a few years back and never re-purchased.  Bought it again recently (I had become unimpressed with my Smashbox under eye primer) and I can&#x27;t remember why I ever got away from this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this over your daytime eye cream &amp; under your under eye concealer.  Works really well to brighten and minimize under eye darkness (which means you need less concealer -- bonus!).  Performs well as a concealer primer and is not drying to the under eye area (I use mine over Benefit&#x27;s It&#x27;s Potent! eye cream right now, and they&#x27;re a great team).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and there&#x27;s only so much Botox can do.  Since my teens I&#x27;ve been a black-eyeliner-on-the-inner rim kind of gal.  This does not bode well once you arrive in your 30&#x27;s.  For years I&#x27;ve used powder to prevent the liner from creeping into the fine lines on my lower inner lids (haggard!) but this so-called trick tended to render a cakey look and accentuate the wrinkles.  Okay... so it was either creeping, messy liner or more noticeable wrinkles.  Then this product came along and I was saved.  I will never be without this.  Plumps up the fine lines so the liner doesn&#x27;t meander and settle in, plus it brightens the inner corners of my eyes imparting a bit of oomph.  I use it twice a day.  Once in the morning, and then a touch-up in the early afternoon.  My only complaint is just that, it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power to last the whole day.</li>
    <li> really lightens my dark circles.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
    <li> Benefit never fails me. I love this under eye concealer because it doesn&#x27;t crease, and it is creamy.  Just right for someone with aging skin.</li>
    <li> I discovered this stuff a couple of years ago at Macy&#x27;s.  It is great for a quick eye pick me up.  It is not a cure for puffy eyes but it is a temporary relief.  The Macy&#x27;s store near me quit carrying the benefit line so I ordered it from Amazon.  Just a couple dots will do ya!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! It makes me look so much more bright-eyed! With three kids under 5 and a bad case of insomnia, I have the WORST dark circles underneath my eyes. But this makes me look AWESOME. Seriously, it is SO worth the price tag if you want to look fresh and relaxed. I love that it seems to last all day, as well. I never need to reapply.</li>
    <li> Helps shrink swollen eyes and reduces dark circles. Pat it on for best results. Great under eyes. Remember to pat it on. Can apply some make up after this dries.</li>
    <li> I would give this seller 0 stars. The product I received is not from benefit cosmetics. It&#x27;s not even the same color and has no brightening effect whatsoever. Although I received a full refund I afraid to purchase any kind of cosmetics from this seller and amazon.</li>
    <li> I cannot give Ooh La Lift a good word.  When I received my product and tried to start using it, there was so little in there, that I could hardly find enough to dab under my eyes.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It is easy to apply, lasts a long time, and looks pretty.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s a fake. The box and the tube inside just doesn&#x27;t feel like an authentic Benefit&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> This product is just okay as an under eye brightened. I don&#x27;t see a difference when I use it. Would not repurchase.</li>
    <li> This brightener is fantastic. I use three dabs before foundation and three dabs after and it&#x27;s like I&#x27;m an new person! I don&#x27;t have terribly dark circles under my eyes, but they ARE there. I feel my dark circles are somewhat average for a female in my early thirties. My mom, who is in her early 50&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t as pleased with the results of using this brightener, but she did say that it is somewhat helpful. Just wanted to give an age reference if you&#x27;re wondering how good it does on different ages. I will continue to purchase this product and keep my fingers crossed that a rigorous eye-care routine will help keep the darkening of my under-eye circles at bay. :) Magnificent product.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have true dark circles under my eye, nor does my skin bag, so concealers rarely work well on me. My under-eye area is just a tad sunken, and this does lift the area just right. The cooling is actually slightly negative for me, but I think most people would find it pleasant and effective. Very easy to use</li>
    <li> Love this,,, been using it for years and have turned all my friends onto it,,,,,can&#x27;t be without it</li>
    <li> I love Benefit and would usually recommend their products but Ooh la lift isn&#x27;t consistent and often times makes no difference at all</li>
    <li> This product is not a miracle, but it can moisture and brighter the eye area and make you look more rested and with brighter eyes.  I have been using is for about 4 years and really like it.</li>
    <li> This product works great, conceals under eye circles and puffiness, I use it under regular foundation, it reflects light and moisturizes wrinkles, i feel no need to use under eye concealer when using this product, just a regular light foundation. I am updateing this review, although I do love this product I am goimng to quit using it, as I now have a list of bad ingedients in make up and unfortunalty there are two parabens in the ingredient list. Unless they take them out I wont be using.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I highly recommend it for people who want to brighten up their eyes.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles and puffiness and the Benefit Ooh La Lift definitely helps to camouflage them.  Nothing makes these two conditions totally disappear but definitely brightens the area so you look more rested.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Just what I expected!</li>
    <li> this is a wonderful product..I use it under my eyes and it blends in, doesn&#x27;t look fake and makes my eyes look bigger.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have much of a review because it literally. does. nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes were puffy. I used this product as directed. My eyes are now puffy and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the product several times. I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice anything when I use this product. Not even a hit of highlight. Save your money, not worth it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice a real difference. Maybe I need to give it more of a chance, but I noticed I had to apply a lot more than it said before I saw a difference.</li>
    <li> Nice stuff but not enough coverage for my age (63).  Still, a lovely result &amp;it may look better to others. I&#x27;m pretty critical!  Glad I ordered it and it might be better in the Spring.</li>
    <li> This is a product that I have used daily for years. I was pleased to purchase it at significantly less than the department store price.</li>
    <li> Does nothing to hide dark circles that tend to (re) appear around 3:00 in the afternoon.  Kinda made them more noticeable, actually.  Save your $$.</li>
    <li> I got this because I love the mascara by Benefit (they&#x27;re real) &amp; thought that it would be just as wonderful! Ehhh! I could take it or leave it! It doesn&#x27;t work all that well and white eye shadow does just as good as job! Maybe someone else will discover the OOH LA out of it and get the LIFT they are looking for, but not this 44 year old! :)</li>
    <li> I read good reviews on this one and decided to buy it, it does not work on me, I have under eye bags and I really wished this could be the product that will work on me but it doesnt, it is like I did not apply anything under my eyes.</li>
    <li> Loved how this product worked for me. Due to my health I toss and turn most nights and with my heredetary dark circles it really shows when I&#x27;m tired. I put this on and immediately I saw a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I will point out that 3 dots was not enough for me. I had to do a few more per eye for it to really cover all the necessary areas. I don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;m just glad to find something that works so well!</li>
    <li> This is pretty cool stuff......I don&#x27;t even need a mirror to put it on.  I feel uplifted and more youthful wearing this!!!</li>
