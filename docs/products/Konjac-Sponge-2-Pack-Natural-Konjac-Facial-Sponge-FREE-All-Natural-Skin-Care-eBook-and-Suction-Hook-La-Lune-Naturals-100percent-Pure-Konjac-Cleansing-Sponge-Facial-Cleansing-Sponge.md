<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This sponge looks, feels, and works exactly like other similar sponges I have used, but at half the price.  What a find!</li>
    <li> The sponge was exactly what I expected. It works well to cleanse and lightly exfoliate the face. The only issue is that from the 2-pack, one had pink spots and a moldy smell when rehydrated rendering it useless. A replacement of that one sponge would be appreciated.</li>
    <li> Love it! I don&#x27;t use anything else to clean my face.</li>
    <li> Wore out quickly, and I prefer buf-puf type sponges for the price-- if you have very sensitive skin, these might be better for you though.</li>
    <li> I just opened my package and the sponge is black and moldy looking.  I&#x27;ve purchased sponges from other brands before and they were never dis colored like this.  I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> i love,love this facial sponge. i will be buying these again!! i just ordered for Christmas gifts.</li>
    <li> Because I have rosacea, I am careful about what I use and do to my face.  The konjac sponges are very gentle and leave the skin shiny and squeaky clean.  I think that my pores have reduced too.</li>
    <li> I have never attempted to exfoliate my face until recently when I began trying out different creams and gels. I&#x27;ve tried just using a simple washcloth, but it doesn&#x27;t exactly exfoliate as to do this correctly you need to use a facial scrub or sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days ago I was sent a Premium Pure Konjac Cleansing Sponge to test out, which features 2 sponges and a free suction cup hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What exactly is a Konjac?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konjac is a plant of the genus Amorphophallus and the Konjac used for these sponges are 100% pure! It is free of chemicals, paragons and sulphates. It is also biodegradable! These type of sponges are meant to get rid of blackheads and skin breakouts. It removes toxins and impurities by gently exfoliating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is first time that have ever used a Konjac Sponge, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I received these two sponges. When I first removed the sponges from the box they felt more like a stone that is until I soaked in water and it became a regular sponge. While I don&#x27;t have any blackheads or acne, I do breakout on my neck every time when I shave, so I&#x27;ve been using the sponge with a moisturizer cream. I&#x27;m glad to say that I have seen some results as my neck is nearly cleared. Overall, I have enjoyed using the Premium Pure Konjac Cleansing Sponge and I recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary sample in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates well and it feels cleaner than other types of facial exfoliators I&#x27;ve had, it doesn&#x27;t get that musty smell.</li>
    <li> I have been hearing about the sponges for quite a long time now. I was given the opportunity to test out this brand of KonJack sponges.&lt;br /&gt;I received the white non-charcoal ones.&lt;br /&gt;This company sends out a very nice package and a good quality product for a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;After I activated the sponge by soaking it in water, I wash my face and I use the sponge to massage the cleaner into my face a little more.&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed my face and then the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I then use the sponge without cleaner to go over those few areas that get dry patches on them.&lt;br /&gt;I expected it to feel a little more abrasive but was happily surprised that the sponge felt very soft on my face while thoroughly cleansing at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that threw me off a tiny bit is that this sponge on it&#x27;s on while it&#x27;s wet feels a little slippery or like it&#x27;s coated in something like a light hair conditioner. If a very soft I don&#x27;t want to say that it felt slimy but I did not expected to feel as slippery as it did. From what I found out this is normal. Because of how it felt I did not expect it to take care of the flaky patches on my face as thoroughly as it did. Everything I&#x27;ve heard about the sponges was true for me anyways.&lt;br /&gt;I have that bipolar skin. Sometimes it&#x27;s oily with dry flaky patches sometimes it&#x27;s dry with oil he patches sometimes it sensitive with all of the above.&lt;br /&gt;What I like is that the sponge did not cause a lot of redness on my skin like my washcloth usually does or a rougher scrubby.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to try the charcoal activated sponge next.&lt;br /&gt;This brand puts out a wonderful product and they have other things for sale that I cannot wait to try.&lt;br /&gt;They are very good with customer service and follow up too.&lt;br /&gt;They are a new company and I really hope that they do well. They have a good product and it is priced fairly. It&#x27;s hard to find quality products with the good price nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again La Lune!</li>
    <li> A great lo-tech alternative to buying an expensive Clarisonic.</li>
    <li> Love this beauty product. I have sensitive skin and this sponge cleanses and exfoliates without irritation. Also love the free e-book that is part of the package. I am buying this for my mother, too.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the way my skin looks since using this sponge. I have been using it on my neck and decolletage area and I believe my skin looks tighter. I bought two sets of sponges one set for me and the other for my son. My son with acne is using it now also. So many blackheads have been released! So I having known exfoliation is key to great skin have been extremely happy with this product. I highly recommend these sponges.</li>
    <li> Gave as gift. Looks like high quality product.</li>
    <li> I have been using the sponges for about 2 weeks and love them!  I keep one in the bathroom to use at night and the other is in the shower.  So soft yet exfoliates really well.  My skin is so soft after using the sponges.  I have also been using less cleanser and works really well. I also like how easily the sponges rinse clear and ready for the next use.  I will definitely re-order and let others know how great the sponges are!</li>
    <li> I used the konjac cleansing sponge without soap. The sponge is very soft making it perfect for sensitive skin. My skin felt great after just one use.</li>
    <li> hi its very nice it dose what they sad and the co very helpful i will buy again thanks.</li>
    <li> La Lune Naturals Konjac Sponge is an all-natural cleansing sponge, made from sustainable konjac plant, and is free of chemicals paragons, and sulphates. It is biodegradable, cruelty-free, and vegan. While preventing breakouts and blackheads, this konjac sponge gently exfoliates your skin, removes toxins, and impurities, to reveal smooth, brighter looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitive skin can make skincare difficult because even the products targeted for my skin type can cause irritation or breakouts, but I have heard many positive results from konjac sponges that I just had to give it a chance. I have found just the right product for me with La Lune Naturals Konjac Sponge. Within the first use, I was hooked. It’s a gentle massage that is soothing, and left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I did not want to stop, actually!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions, I soaked the sponge in water until it was soft, then gently massaged my face in a circular motion. It can be used with or without cleanser, but for the first use, I decided to do without. It was gentle but cleansed my skin thoroughly, without causing any redness. After using, it’s directed to rinse the sponge, then gently press between two hands to dry. A hook was included in the package, which I appreciated because it fit in the spot I hung it up. It’s recommended to replace every 2-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this product, and now look forward to using it in my nightly routines! It’s an affordable, cruelty-free cleansing sponge with positive results. I would recommend this to anyone looking to try out a konjac sponge, or new way to exfoliate without harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> Its not as rough as i was expecting. soft, which may be good for sensitive skin. it feels slimey when wet. I do a lot of stuff with photographers and wear heavy make up. I don&#x27;t feel as if this gets it all off. It is a good size though and i like that it comes with a suction cup/hook. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this kind again but i am going to try the charcoal ones.</li>
    <li> Not what I was expecting to be honest. I purchased this with the sole purpose of exfoliation for my face. The sponge felt like I was using a cotton ball. This product might be good for some, but it was not what I was looking for. The shipping and delivery was great. A refund would be great.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and silky without all those chemicals. Use less product. Use everyday.</li>
    <li> My skin feels so softer after I use this sponge...never had anything like it....will stick with these sponges. So gentle yet thorough in cleaning. I just add a small amount of my favourite cleanser and it cleans without stripping. I highly recommend these sponges!!!</li>
    <li> Sponges are a little smaller than the other one I had.  Works well though.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. For me is not sufficiently abrasive. But using a exfoliater it makes the role.</li>
    <li> Cant go without these ever since i discovered them. I add a little bit of my cleanser and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Bought two packs of these sponges for my daughters.  One in particular is a makeup artist for Mac cosmetics in Los Angeles... They have both agreed this is probably the best gift I&#x27;ve given them , the product in their opinion. Is excellent. That&#x27;s why I gave them 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I am happy with how soft my skin is after using the sponge at night for a week. I suctioned the suction cup to my vanity mirror and hang it to dry, which is very convenient. It only takes a minute to get soft, and I found only the edges of the sponge get hard in between uses. I rub my face wash (Cetaphil) on my face and neck first, then massage with the sponge. That way I have control over the distribution of wash on my skin. After a week, I notice a slight breakdown of the sponge, so we&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;I wish the size of the sponge was larger, maybe 25% more would offer better handling. Also, I wish the company would stop emailing me to make a review and tell me &#x27;I&#x27;m awesome.&#x27;</li>
    <li> This Konjac Sponge is the absolute best!! Follow the directions for softening them. Feels great on your skin. You will only need a small amount of your face cleanser since the sponge creates a lather. My skin looks great. Other people have even noticed the difference. Will definitely reorder these sponges. These come with a hook, and two sponges. Great company to order from.</li>
    <li> These work great, exfoliates gently while definitely making my skin smoother over time.</li>
    <li> Great sponge, really soft so I feel comfortable to use it on my face and even around my eyes. Works well with soap an also oils I use to clean my face. Easy to clean and comes with a little suction hanger.</li>
    <li> My skin requires a lot of maintenance, and I always appreciate products that can make it easier to keep my skin looking healthy.  I have been hearing so much about konjac sponges, which are an all-natural skincare product.  Konjac sponges are simply made from the sustainable konjac plant.  There are no chemicals, nothing added.. so you don&#x27;t have to worry about chemicals, parabens, sulfates, etc.  Plus, you can compost it when you are done, which makes it very environmentally friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually used a konjac sponge once before, but the La Lune Konjac Sponge is much larger in size than my previous sponge.  When it is dry, it is hard, so you need to soak it prior to using it.  Once you soak it, it becomes soft and very comfortable to use on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this on my face in the shower, and it is a great way to massage and exfoliate my face.  It is very gentle, so if you are used to harsher scrubs or sponges, this is much gentler.  I am prone to breakouts and the konjac sponge is gentle enough to use on problem areas without being rough on your skin.  I can really massage my face without experiencing any sensitivity, since it is so gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges come with a hook for hanging, so you can let it dry between uses.  It is supposed to last about 2-4 months, and is completely biodegradable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product free of charge in exchange for an honest review.  Since I only use natural skincare products, I was happy to give this a try and was pleasantly pleased to find these were larger than the ones I have tried in the past.</li>
    <li> This sponges are bigger than the once i had, but still smaller than your palm. Love the packaging and customer care, in the package it actually came with a little hook for the sponge! great idea! I also received $2 OFF coupon, which was nice too.&lt;br /&gt;The sponge itself is dry when not wet and softens ALOT when is wet.. I am getting more and more attached to those Konjac sponges, clean my face every day, usually without soap or anything, just the sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about a month and I love how they make such a tiny amount of face wash go long way. I use about a quarter of the amount I was using on a washcloth, and my face feels so much smoother and looks brighter!</li>
    <li> I love this product! You only have to use a very small amount of cleanser. My face feels smoother and looks so much better.</li>
    <li> These sponges are amazing my face feels really soft. I will buy them again for sure.</li>
    <li> Does a great job at exfoliating without irritating my skin or over stripping.  I use mine with a facial wash on a daily basis with very good results.</li>
    <li> So what&#x27;s the deal with &amp;#34;Konjac Sponges&amp;#34;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I wanted to know, so I got one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not know:&lt;br /&gt;Konjac Sponges are made from a form of a potato from Asia. (aka Plant Fiber)&lt;br /&gt;It breaks down over time naturally, in approx two months, so you will need to replace it fairly often. They are not overly-expensive so this won&#x27;t break the bank!&lt;br /&gt;You can use these with a little water, or a cleaners, or even a scrubbing moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else I found out:&lt;br /&gt;They leave your skin feeling much softer by removing deep-down dirt and germs, and dead/dying skin cells. This helps refresh your face, open the pores and the skin to &#x27;breathe&#x27; better.&lt;br /&gt;Then you may notice you don&#x27;t have to use near as much moisturizer because the face will be able to produce it&#x27;s own natural oils better. I also use this on my neck as well and it softens the skin there too, that&#x27;s a huge plus for me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep a clean face, and it will keep you looking pretty!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When squeezing out the water, because I have arthritis, I found it easiest to place it between both palms and push hard several times (this is after rinsing &amp;amp; rinsing to make sure any cleansers or dead skin is out, of course). Get out as much water as you can, then (in my opinion) hang it AWAY from moist areas. My home is small, so it&#x27;s actually stored in my bedroom on the mirror! LOL (That also reminds me ever single night to wash my face. I always need a reminder because there are too many times I go to bed without doing that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can sterilize the (moist, not dry) sponge in the microwave on high for one minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please follow all directions from the packaging before using, storing, and sanitizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When ordering this set from La Lune Naturals, you will get 2 sponges, a suction hook, and a great e-book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(you can download Kindle onto your pc/laptop from Amazon for free)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was asked to test and review this product, with no other promise of compensation, and give my honest opinion.product, with no other promise of compensation, and give my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Great product; exactly what I was expecting. Sponge is easy to use and can already notice a difference in my skin after just a week of use.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I have been using this product for about two weeks. It made my face feel smoother and seems to be clearing up small breakouts I tend to get around the edge of my face. Buy this if you are considering it you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> Today I wanted to let you know about a nifty little face cleanser called the Pure Konjac Cleansing Sponges by La Lune Naturals.  Each order comes in a two pack for less money than you would spend by purchasing just one in a store.  I&#x27;ve never ever used a Konjac Sponge before, and wasn&#x27;t very sure what to expect.  I loved that the description said I would have more radiant skin by using them.  Everyone wants better skin right?  Well, here is what I found out about Konjac Sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Konjac sponges are all the rage in Japan and are super soft sponges that are made from the fibrous root of the Japanese Konjac plant.  They&#x27;re great for acne, rosacea and sensitive skin.  They are really soft on your face and are less abrasive than scrubs and most exfoliators. They are so gentle that with a little soap and water, they can remove your makeup as well as your mascara without hurting your skin.  By exfoliating your skin, you&#x27;ll notice younger, glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he Konjac sponge I tried came with a little hook connected to a suction cup, so it was easy to keep close by in the shower.  The sponge had a little flower in it where you can add your body wash.  By doing this, the sponge stays sudsy.  These sponges are cruelty free, free of chemicals and are vegan.  The one important thing to do is make sure your sponge is totally submerged in water before you use it.  I found that out the hard way ;)  The sponge is biodegradable and will break down over time which is why they recommend replacing it every month or two.  You&#x27;ll totally love this nifty little sponge.  I love using it to remove my makeup and my skin has more of a glow to it now.  I will definitely be using more of these konjac sponges in the future.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites.....</li>
    <li> Both of them broke quickly after two weeks. The quality is too low.</li>
    <li> I ordered these from de Prettilicious (also through Amazon) and it lasted me about six months. This one grew discolored and moldy within the first month of use. Very strange...not sure whether it&#x27;s just quality of product. Also, it seemed to be a little less forgiving than the previous sponge I tried - soaking in water didn&#x27;t really soften it much.</li>
    <li> These were a different texture from any other konjac sponge I have used before, and it they started to smell weird after just a couple uses. This has not been my experience with other brands.</li>
    <li> I like a different brand of sponges much better.  I don&#x27;t feel like these sponges take off the makeup, with or without using soap.  Even after washing my face with soap, I use a toner and continue getting makeup off.</li>
    <li> This was a great purchase as the sponges are larger than expected. They do cleanse very well and I use one for the face and the other for the body. Sudsing is fantastic with my shower gel and I don&#x27;t have to use as much as with natural loofah sponge. They dry and reharden as should and soften easily with water. The ebook offer is an added plus to show you ways to make use of the sponge.</li>
    <li> This is novel and gentle but I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s very effective either...doesn&#x27;t even remove peeling skin, for example. The enclosed suction cup hook was completely useless.</li>
    <li> Received on time. Love this product. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This sponge leaves my face feeling cleaner than if I just use my hands to wash my face. My skin feels smooth, clean and fresh. Once it is wet, it is soft and gives gentle exfoliation. I use it once a day at night .</li>
    <li> After one use I can tell a difference from what I usually use to wash my face. This is really a great product that I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Interesting product, once soaked it is super soft and gently exfoliates the skin. I think it doesn&#x27;t have as many fibers as other konjac sponges I have tried, but it gets the job done. Its really natural and helps with blackheads around the nose area. However, it is not as durable as some I&#x27;ve tried so I give it three stars.</li>
    <li> Luv luv luv the Konjac sponge.... It left my face feeling clean and smooth.  Although I have only used it once I can feel the difference.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after several uses.  I would highly recommend to others</li>
    <li> I have noticed my skin has been feeling cleaner and less break outs - I am in my 60&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This sponge is AMAZING!! It makes my skin feel clean! Better than any facial cleanser! Great packaging and fast shipping, too! Will definitely be doing business with this company again! :)</li>
    <li> Ok! This is my absolute favorite product from this line! I work in a dirty work environment and this deep cleans my skin. This is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> What a great sponge for cleaning  your face! Could not believe the makeup and dirt it removed. It saves on cleanser as well . A great product to have by your sink! Would make a great stocking stuffer for Christmas for girls any age.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge. It works well, and it give a lot of foam.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this sponge would probably work very well for sensitive skin or everyday washing but it is a bit soft for true exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen other sponges - perhaps by this same seller - that would definitely do a better job for a good exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it is a nice sponge but in the 2 or so weeks that I&#x27;ve used it, it has begun to tear a bit at the bottom. Most likely, this is because I&#x27;ve been trying to use it to exfoliate which, like I said, it is a bit too soft for that.</li>
    <li> I love that this comes with a small suction hook for the shower. The sponge is very smooth on the skin. It arrived quickly. No complaints!</li>
    <li> Love the sponge and the way it makes my face feel. Good product. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with just the right amount of abrasion for a thorough, gentle clean. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Super good for my kids 5year old &amp; 3 year old ezcema skin. Soft &amp; small for there body. Will recommend</li>
    <li> Works great for exfoliating but takes a long time to dry.  If you live in a humid climate this is not a good thing.  I am using it a couple of times per week and letting it dry completely between uses.  It takes a while and I turn it so all sides get dry. I do press with both hands to get the water out, as per instructions, but it holds a lot of water.</li>
    <li> These sponges are incredible!  My face feels so soft after using this sponge.  This is a great way to gently exfoliate your skin. You only need a drop of your cleaner on this sponge. You can feel  the difference in your skin right away... So soft and clean.. Would buy again.  Thanks LA Lune for a great reasonably priced Product!</li>
    <li> Love this new product. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a few weeks and can really see and feel a difference in my sun parched, 67 yr old skin.  Smooth, soft is back!</li>
    <li> alright ladies - i&#x27;ve struggled with keratosis pilaris all my life and this thing is amazing.  It&#x27;s better than using a washcloth because I would always need a fresh washcloth.  This really removes dead skin cells gently.  My skin always feels clean and fresh afterwards.  My acne is under control, and my skin tone and evenness has improved.</li>
    <li> I love these face sponges! This was my second order and I would recommend them to everyone. These sponges gently exfoliate without drying out my skin, so great.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this sponge. .Amazing the way it cleans and leaves your face feeling. I let my face dry naturally without drying with a towel. Amazing sponge!!!</li>
    <li> Nice, makes my skin so smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> great price for great sponges!</li>
    <li> Wow!  Just out of the bag and I knew this sponge was special.  I&#x27;m a senior citizen and this was gentle on my face and no dry and pulling of the skin when finished. love it!</li>
    <li> Sponge feels great, almost like a gel.</li>
    <li> I am 70 and have sensitive skin prone to acne. Yes, still.  The Konjac Sponge hangs beside my bath sink where it dries after I use it ever morning and evening...very handy.  In combination with acid peels, retinol, and vitamin C serums, the sponge keeps my face clear and I enjoy the ease of use.</li>
    <li> I saw a review about the sponges on youtube and decided to try them. Not only was the price affordable, but they work really well.</li>
    <li> WOW!!! SUPER FAST SHIPPING and excellent customer service. My skin is usually pretty sensitive but this product is amazing!  Very impressed with the product and the seller! I will definitely be ordering more!!!!!! Thanks LaLuneNaturals!!!</li>
    <li> Great item and fast shipping too!</li>
    <li> I love this sponge!  This is super soft and a great size for washing my face.  I really wish they made this in a larger size to use on my body!  Great packaging and love that it comes with its own hook too!  Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> Removes makeup better and makes my face feel SO much cleaner than with washcloth or other beauty products! My own personal mini-microdermabrasion every time I wash my face! Love it!</li>
    <li> Love these sponges! They arrived fast and were exactly what I needed! I&#x27;ve been using konjac sponges for a while now and these were great and at a good price point too.</li>
    <li> This sponge is wonderful! I will never use a regular washcloth again. Feels soft with a light exfoliation, not too harsh. I use it with face wash, and it leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; clean.</li>
    <li> I have used konjac sponges before but this one was awful for me. It smelled bad when I opened it from the packaging, the smell dissipated alittle when I used it but it made me all itchy, I had to stop immediately. I am returning.</li>
    <li> Great Item....I like this one more than the dome looking ones.  I use the divot in the sponge to put my cleanser in.  It is very soft feeling and my skin feels great afterwards.  I would recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are amazing! I bought these for myself and for my pre-teen. Once the sponge is wet, the texture and feel on my face is soft, yet exfoliating. I have replaced my sea sponges with these, and in fact, am ordering more! My daughter raves about it, as well.</li>
    <li> Great sponge!  It is very gentle on your face but also leaves you feeling clean!  Also great company it shipped super fast!</li>
    <li> A fantastic sponge that felt so good on my face and neck - a little mini massage. I used a little face soap at night to remove my make up but then just used the sponge with warm water in the morning, no soap. My skin felt refreshed and softer after each use. The sponge is made from a special material that dries hard (like a loofah) but softens after you run it under warm water. Gentle on your skin. Very much looking forward to what my skin will look like two weeks from now. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I received this just a few days ago and so far I love it! I am a lazy face washer and got to bed 6 out of 7 nights with out washing my face. I find face washing with cleansers to me a wet and messy process and fee like I need to mop of my sick and floor when I&#x27;m done. With the Pure Konjack Cleansing sponge I just wet it with warm water and gently wash with just the water. My face is soft and feels clean. I will try to remember to update this review in a week or so with the the results.</li>
    <li> it is nothing I was expected! ridiculously  waist of money........Suggestion: if you want good scribing thing - get a piece of genuine sheep wool felt  cloth and exfoliate you everything : face, whole body and so ..... do not by it - waist of money.</li>
    <li> Konjac sponges are fantastic.  I&#x27;m 57 and have very dry, sensitive skin. I use an alpha-hydroxy night lotion, so my skin needs gentle exfoliation. These clean gently and thoroughly without irritating your skin.  I like the La Lune Naturals sponges because they&#x27;re a great price ($2.50 cheaper than at Ulta).  Also, the La Lune sponges have a string and a suction cup hook.  This is important.  I&#x27;ve had problems with sponges molding-- even sitting on a shower rack to dry.  With the hanging string, the sponge doesn&#x27;t mold.  Buy a set of these today-- you&#x27;ll never go back to other cleansing devices -- yes, I&#x27;ve has a Clarisonic facial cleansing machine.  I think Konjac is better.  Oh, the accompanying e-book is good, too.</li>
    <li> Love how clean my face feels!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It feels so good on your skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just started using these and wanting to find an alternative to cotton balls and a wash cloth. This is so soft and makes your face feel so soft and cleansed afterwards. Even my husband is enjoying the one I gave him!</li>
    <li> I ABSOLUTLY love these sponges. I am hooked, I have been giving them out to my clients and family. They work you will see a difference In your skin right away. My daughter is 18 and she is in love with using it too. My make up looks great also. Love love love them I will keep reordering them I highly recommend them. I am over 40 and was looking for skin care when I saw them pop up and ordered them. I am so glad I did and so will you.</li>
    <li> It cleans my skin so well love it and I do struggle with darkening of the skin because of my pcos, and it cleans it like nobody&#x27;s business. Thanks, La Lune Naturals!</li>
    <li> While this is a cleansing sponge and will clean your face, do not expect it to exfoliate. This sponge takes time to make it usable before each use by needing to be soaked in water for a minute and once it is ready to use it will serve to wash your face. It dries to a hard sponge needing that soak again before use. It is comfortable to hold but does NOT have a rough enough texture to exfoliate my face. I can tell it is a quality sponge but just not what I wanted. Although I knew it needed to be I wish someone had told me that it doesn&#x27;t exfoliate. I also don&#x27;t think I want to spend that much on a sponge.</li>
    <li> Love it!!!!! Great product! My skin feels cleaner and definitely softer, only after using my Konjac sponge for 1 week!!</li>
    <li> Great  for your face!</li>
    <li> Great product, great value!</li>
    <li> These seem great so far. Left our skin very soft after the first use. We&#x27;ll continue to use and see how it treats acne.</li>
    <li> These are small, simple and pretty much perfect for gentle but thorough cleansing. I have a very varied routine, so on days I don&#x27;t any kind of abrasive exfoliation, this little sponge does a better job than microfiber cloths, because the texture lifts instead of smears. Skin is clean, not stripped or irritated. You could use one to remove makeup and the other for a second wash- the Asian way. I suggest this because the depth and pattern of the pores might not be the best for rinsing thick, synthetic products out completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what I like the most is that the very close, layered pores allow any dead skin to rinse away easily rather than get trapped inside like a man-made sponge or loofah. That makes it long-lasting and hygienic; the perfect Clarisonic alternative.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t even bother with anything like this because I was skeptical of any of these types of products, but somehow this little sponge has made me a believer, after testing out for a couple of days my face has become much more soft and has lost its initial &amp;#34;redness&amp;#34; due to acne. Overall i&#x27;m going to have to give this product a thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Sponge arrived when expected and is as described.</li>
    <li> Great way to exfoliate without using  additional product!</li>
    <li> Very soft sponge that leaves my face feeling very clean and normal. My skin does not feel dry and tight after I wash it when I use this sponge.  Without the use of this sponge my skin feels tight and dry. It seems to help my moisturizer go on smoother and absorb better.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleansing sponge. I have only used it for approximately one week, and have noticed more of a glow to my skin. I actually look forward to cleaning my face with this sponge, due to it being different, than other facial sponges I&#x27;ve used in the past. Definitely recommend you give it a try, and you get two for the price that you would pay for one sponge of a similar kind! Will continue to buy these!!Thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome product - best facial sponge I&#x27;ve used in a long time!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t exfoliate diddly squat. Too soft and too small! Stick with a washcloth.</li>
    <li> These are like a magical little scrubby non-scrubby sponge for your face. They are super gentle, enough that I can use them twice a day without \\&quot;ouchie skin\\&quot;, but rough enough that my skin now looks and feels amazing. I am so impressed with these, I&#x27;m recommending these to everybody I know. And I love that they come as a two pack, makes things easier on my end. I swear I get stopped on a weekly basis by people asking about my skin care routine and I tell them about this product. My skin looks amazing now, it not only buffs it but I feel like the sponge absorbs any oil on my skin and as a result I&#x27;m breaking out less that I usually do. I hands down love this product and what it has done for my face.    I received these free for testing/reviewing purposes, all opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> The konjac sponge is made from the sustainable konjac plant, and is free of chemicals, parabens, sulphates and is biodegradable. They are also cruelty-free and vegan. Konjac is grown in China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan and southeast Asia for its large starchy corms, used to create a flour and jelly of the same name. It is also used as a vegan substitute for gelatin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve always been pretty lazy when it came to skin care, only recently have I started testing out different serums, exfoliates, moisturizers etc. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect when I opened the package. The sponge felt like a smooth pumice stone however once you wen it, it becomes more sponge like. At first I didn’t think this sponge was making much of a difference, it felt like I was just rubbing my face with a packing peanut (similar in texture) but I started noticing my face seemed to look fresher and I no longer spotted the stray blackheads or dry patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my face I exfoliate with the sponge (without any soaps or lotions). After a quick rinse and I pat my face dry, I apply my serums and lotion as usual and that’s it! Its super easy. I rinse the sponge and squeeze out all the water and then hang it with the little suction cup that is included.  They recommend sterilizing the sponges every 2-3 weeks by putting the wet sponge in the microwave for 1 minute on High. Replace the sponge when it starts too look worn or becomes less effective, which is approximately after 2-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also included with the purchase was a Free E-Book, “The Ultimate All-Natural Skin Care Guide” which includes a simple 5-Step Skin care system recommended by dermatologists PLUS tons of free mask, scrub and wrap recipes for your skin!</li>
    <li> I recieved this product free of charge in exchange for my honest review. I have tried several Konjac sponges since they became popular. This one ranks pretty high on my list! La Lune has created a unique design and product that makes the sponge as efficient as possible. It&#x27;s a nice size, and gentle on my sensitive skin. After using this with a standard cleanser, i noticed my face appeared softer, less oily, exfoliated, and i had less breakouts. It really provides a nice subtle glow to the skin. Overall I would say i liked this product, it does shrink a little after it dries, but it comes back to life pretty easily. I have attached pictures of the sponge in a dry and wet state. Thank you for the oppritunity to try this product!</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great service!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a gentle way to exfoliate and am in LOVE with this sponge! My skin feels super soft. It comes with a little hook too so I can keep it in the shower and use it each morning.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I use with and without a cleanser.  I believe it really saves on the amount of cleanser I use. I received it promptly (within 48 hours) after placing my order. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Another great product from La Lune! Not only is the sponge great, but I love the little suction cup that comes with it! Thanks so much for a wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Thanks again for getting this out so quickly, I&#x27;ll definitely come back when I need a refill!</li>
    <li> This product leaves your face feeling smooth and clean without irritation.  Be sure to follow the directions and let the sponge absorb water first.  I have enjoyed using the product.&lt;br /&gt;The product makes great gifts.</li>
    <li> It provides a gentle wash (very, very light facial exfoliation), alone or with soap, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $5 for it!</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing sponge! We have several products from La Lune Naturals and they do wonders for the skin!!! The shipping was also very fast every time we ordered anything from them and the costumer service is great. We will definitely keep buying La Lune Naturals&#x27; products!!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried the charcoal konjac sponge made by La Lune Naturals and it helped balance my skin PH. I then decided to mix it up with the white konjac for a natural clean facial cleanse. It works great and my skin is so soft! I&#x27;m going to try the seaweed powder now! This company makes great quality!</li>
    <li> Great product, great customer service and positive results.  I have been so happy with this sponge that I am giving them as Christmas presents this year to everyone I know.  Will definitely do business again with them!</li>
    <li> This is my third purchase of La Lune Natural products. I plan to buy more of these. They make my face feel so fresh!</li>
    <li> Works really well!  I hadn&#x27;t tried one of these sponges before, and was pleasantly surprised.  My skin felt very clean, but not at all dry.</li>
    <li> Super gentle cleansing sponge made from konjac. Konjac is a natural product, it&#x27;s a starchy root. I love using konjac sponges to remove eye makeup since they are super gentle and work really great! The texture is perfect to get your makeup efficiently and without pulling on your skin. These are excellent for gentle exfoliation. Also, there are no added ingredients to these sponges so they are great for all skin types. These sponges last long and are earth-friendly. You need to be careful and dry them out between uses. I love that this pack of kpnjac sponges comes with a suction hook! So perfect to hang up the sponge for thorough drying!&lt;br /&gt;When you are finished using the sponge (about a month), you can compost it! Or reuse it in a potted plant to retain moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom… she loves it!</li>
    <li> Good price and great sponges.  Introduced these to my mom by sharing the second sponge.  These are not as pictured, our were flatter and larger diameter.  Compared to a charcoal one I had these seem milder and work good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product! For the low price, whick includes two in the package, it works great.</li>
    <li> Cleaning my face is an insanely important part of my skincare routine. I suffer from hormonal-based acne breakouts, so I have to be very careful about what I put on my face. Minor changes often result in breakouts or inflammation of current blemishes.... Sometimes I feel like my face is some strange science experiment. That being said, I love getting to try out new beauty tools that supplement my routine without creating aggravation. I received this set of konjac sponges complimentary in exchange for an open and honest review. Many skincare brands have recently introduced Konjac Sponges to their lines, and I have to say, I am a huge fan. I have tried a few different ones, and I am currently loving my La Lune Naturals Pure Konjac Cleansing Sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unaware, a Konjac Sponge is an exfoliating sponge used to cleanse the face. I&#x27;m sure you could probably use this on your body as well, although I would not recommend using the same one on your body that you plan to also use on your face. Just my opinion though, feel free to do what you like, no judgement! My skin thrives from exfoliation. I could use a scrub every single day, and the dermatologist would tell me it is OK, because my face literally has NO bacteria on it. I have had a special analysis done at the dermatologist before and they said they normally discourage the use of face scrubs regularly, but because my skin was so clean, they told me to do whatever I wanted. When I feel that my face needs a break from the abrasion of a scrub, I use my La Lune Naturals Konjac Sponge with a regular cleanser and I still walk away with clean, baby-soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even better, these Konjac sponges are made free of chemicals, parabens and sulfates, while also being biodegradable! Its made from the highly sustainable Konjac plant, whose fibers work hard to pull away the toxins and impurities that dull our skin. Plus, the Konjac sponge itself is very lightweight and therefore gentle. There are a couple ofreasons why I keep this baby hanging around the bathroom. One, when I treat my acne, it gets dried out and therefore flaky. No one likes to look like they have Leprosy, including myself, so I use my Konjac sponge to gently remove the &amp;#34;flakies&amp;#34; from my face without further irritating my breakouts. And second, my skin is dry in the Winter and doesn&#x27;t need further aggravation, so I use fewer scrubs and more gel, cream, and liquid cleansers with my Konjac sponge to get my desired outcome. And lastly, it does a wonderful job at removing make-up from my skin at the end of the day, so that is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> These really work! I have hypersensitive skin due to an auto-immune disorder and my skin can&#x27;t candle harsh exfoliation. Every night, while showering, I use these with my cleanser. My skin afterwards is soft and balanced without irritation. The trick to making these last is to always gently wring them out by smashing it between your hands while wet. Then you must let them dry away from the humid bathroom environment. I will definitely repurchase from this company when the time comes!</li>
    <li> I love my new Konjac Sponge. It leaves my skin super soft and smooth. My makeup goes on much easier and it helps to give my face a flawless look.</li>
    <li> Love this sponge!!!! Love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> I like this sponge alot, I use it in the shower and as a facial sponge. It did exactly what it claims, exfoliating nicely. My only concern is the seam between the bottom and the top is a little rough,so you need to be careful about using it correctly on your face. If it weren&#x27;t for this I would have given it five stars.</li>
    <li> Finally a sponge to make my skin look and feel like it did in my 20s!  I&#x27;m guilty of only using a washcloth and cleanser in the shower for years but this makes my skin feel so clean.  It exfoliates nicely so I only use every few days. I ordered on a Friday night and with Amazon Prime it was delivered on Sunday morning!!!</li>
    <li> A gentle exfoliator and great for makeup removal!  Much more pleasant to use than the facial loofahs I&#x27;ve been using, and soft enough to reach all the contours of the face.  The little string attached to it allows it to be hung to air out between uses.</li>
    <li> Great Product and Great Company!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also have a wonderful healing clay.  I&#x27;ve also ordered seaweed kelp and peppermint oil and can&#x27;t wait to try them both!!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the pure Konjac Cleansing Sponges.  I love how it feels cleansing your face.  It&#x27;s like a gentle massage.  I plan to buy for my daughter, who has acne skin, and also my Mom, who has mature skin.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll love them as much as me.</li>
    <li> I have only ever used one other Konjac sponge and I found this one just as easy to use and very effective.  Soak the sponge in water until soft then in a circular motion, massage gently over your face.  You can use these with our without cleanser but I find that they are a great way to blend in cleansing lotions and oils..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a hook included that will stick anywhere in your bathroom so you can hang your sponge up until the next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sponges come nicely packaged and I found them to be really soft on my skin with a slight roughness that helps exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these sponges to try out and review.</li>
    <li> These Konjac Sponges come in packs of 2, which are individually sealed.  The plastic bags tear open super easy, which is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the hollowed out area in the center of the sponges.  No more dollops of soap landing in my sink!  Plus, the two little suction cups are perfect for hanging up the sponge!  I put mine on my bathroom mirror and they don&#x27;t fall off!  WIN!  I have a teeny-tiny bathroom sink with basically no vanity, so this is AMAZING for me!  I love that my Konjac sponge can dry easily without taking up space or risking it taking a tumble onto the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels great on my skin; I love the gentle exfoliation that it provides!  Definitely fine for daily, even twice daily use.  I definitely recommend this one!</li>
    <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;  I am always looking for something new when it comes to skincare and when I had the opportunity to review the Konjac Sponge I was really eager to. I was really excited to learn that the Konjac sponge is all natural and derived from a plant, hence making it vegan and cruelty free. It is also supposed to help prevent blackheads and stop breakouts so I was really excited about that. The sponges, since there are two in a box, arrived  quickly in an attractive cardboard box which is recyclable (another added bonus). Each sponge is packaged individually in its&#x27; own air tight sealed bag and a little suction cup with a hook is also included to make it easy to hang up and dry.The sponges themselves are HUGE. They are easily the size of my palm. I soaked the sponge until it became soft and then I gently messaged my face with it. You can use it with and without an face wash . It is gentle and cleans my skin thoroughly without any rough or harsh scrubbing nor did I have any redness afterwards. When I was done I rinsed the sponge and the pressed it between the palms of my hands twice to get the excess water out then I simply placed it on the hook to air dry when I was done. Since this is plant derived it does break down in about 2 months so with two sponges this will last awhile and it won&#x27;t break the bank. After using this product my skin looks healthier and I have less blackheads and my acne has diminished, I am really pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> One of these arrived with black mold on it, and it wasn&#x27;t vacuum sealed like the other one. I&#x27;m keeping it as I&#x27;m too lazy to return it, and I like the sucktion cup hook it comes with.</li>
