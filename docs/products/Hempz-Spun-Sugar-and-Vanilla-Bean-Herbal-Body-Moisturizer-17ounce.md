    <li> Love the smell of this! The sparkle in it is a bonus!!!</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and is very rich.  I love the Hempz line of lotions and body washes.</li>
    <li> Awesome price- smells amazing! Love the shimmer</li>

    <li> Same great quality lotion (I have many fragrances of Hempz) but the fragrance isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. Not very vanilla-y.</li>
    <li> Love Hempz lotion, so I tried a different fragrance and I really like the smell. Only issue was the pump was not working, but still works great and smells good.</li>
    <li> Very moisturizing and gives off a nice sheen in the light.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion!  Non-greasy and a hint of sparkle!</li>
    <li> Love the smell of it! Goes on nicely, but didn&#x27;t know it had a &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; to it.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite lotion!  Great scent, moisturizer and a little hint of shimmer!  Love it!</li>
    <li> This smells horrible and plastic-like. It does not even compare to the same product I tried at the salon and I am dissatisfied. I can&#x27;t even use it because the smell is overwhelmingly unpleasant. I find it rather deceptive that this is marketed as the Hempz brand you buy in salons.</li>
    <li> The light shimmer is only visible in the sun light or under bright night light. It is not like a glitter cream or a shimmer cream. It is some where in between. I have countless women ask me what type of lotion I have on and where I got this fabulous lotion. Great soothing moisturizer. Thanks Hempz this limited addition lotion is a winner</li>
    <li> Awesome lotion and would definitely recommend it and was much less expensive</li>
    <li> So I missed the part that it has &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34;.  Does it ever!  I put this on before going outside and I looked like one of those stupid vampires from Twilight.  I love the scent, just can&#x27;t stand the shimmer.  So I gave it 4 stars.</li>
    <li> Sadly this is a fail for the Hempz line.  The smell is irritating to the nasal passages.&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is if the standard quality, too bad the scent is not enticing.</li>
    <li> Smells awesome and has a nice shimmer.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion and getting it at such a great price is a win win.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Hempz products. This especially smells wonderful</li>
    <li> the smell is simply amazing. The trace amount of sparkle in the lotion is divine. And it&#x27;s not greasy at all. Most amazing lotion I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
