      <li>I do purchase this repeatedly because it is light, natural and a good moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this, thinking I was getting the original.</li>

      <li>I can no longer find the original</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t found anything as good in a long time</li>
      <li>This is a really good product and it truly makes your skin feel nicer and not as dry.</li>

      <li>First time user  of this product.  </li>

      <li>;)</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m always amazed and how smooth and clear my skin looks.</li>
      <li>But, then my chin broke out with some pretty gnarly pimples.</li>
      <li>The fair is too light for me and the medium a tad too dark, so I bought both and then mixed for an exact match with my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I would recommend Boots # 7 Tinted Moisturizer to anyone who wants a radiant and even complexion.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a month now and noticed that my skin is much smoother.</li>
      <li>It is such a natural look and better for my skin.  </li>
      <li>I like it, but feel I might need a better coverage due to the redness of my complexion.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d probably laugh at me if I told you I wasn&#x27;t aware there was a tinted moisturizer until just recently.</li>
      <li>It was the perfect color, evened my skin tone, and didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant or irritate my eyes.</li>
      <li>This has an SPF of 15, which is decent.</li>
      <li>If you will be out in the direct sun for a period of time, the directions say yo replace every 15 mins.</li>
      <li>Boots is too drying for mature skin</li>
      <li>, I use moisturizer everyday, and this gives me more coverage than with moisturizer, only.</li>
      <li>and I sometimes have a hard time getting it to blend smoothly.</li>
      <li>I thought I had ordered the No7 Soft and Sheer in the white tube.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff and no longer wear foundation.  It is such a natural look and better for my skin.  Boots no 7 is really a great line and I&#x27;ve bought all the expensive stuff and prefer this line.</li>
    <li> What a great and easy way to look like you have just a touch of makeup on. Love this!</li>
    <li> Gives very good coverage for that &amp;#34;no makeup&amp;#34; look. Great for the weekend, when you want something lighter.</li>

    <li> I like it. Nice color for my pale skin, light, and seemed breathable. But, then my chin broke out with some pretty gnarly pimples. The kind that never happen to me anymore, so I knew it had to be this. Still, it&#x27;s nice, if you don&#x27;t break out!</li>
    <li> bECAUSE,BEING A LONDONER I USED TO USE IT THERE AND LIKED IT AND AM SO HAPPY THAT I CAN GET IT HERE.</li>
    <li> Boots is too drying for mature skin</li>
    <li> Great tinted moisturizer.  It provides light coverage, goes on smoothly, I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d probably laugh at me if I told you I wasn&#x27;t aware there was a tinted moisturizer until just recently. I do use moisturizer but never a tinted one. Where have I&#x27;ve been? Crazy to think I wasn&#x27;t aware there was such thing, I&#x27;m an idiot! Ha ha Ha! I LOVE this product! It made my skin looking smooth and shiny, honestly, I keep looking in the mirror every chance I get admiring my skin.  ;) it&#x27;s as if my skin is glowing. I&#x27;ve even been asked quite a few times what changes I&#x27;ve made since I started using this. There&#x27;s not a day that I didnt use and I&#x27;ll never let myself ran out, after all, I&#x27;m making up for the lost time!--I&#x27;m now a confirmed BOOTS products dependent!  😜</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not very matte and I feel it does look a bit shiney</li>
    <li> This is a really good product and it truly makes your skin feel nicer and not as dry. I have been using it for a month now and noticed that my skin is much smoother. This is also good because of the skin protection from the sun. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I hope this Item comes in bigger sizes.  That is all I use.  pass it on BIGGER SIZE BOTTLES!!!! i WANT A LARGER QUATITY.</li>
    <li> i love this line of cosmetics.</li>
    <li> This is perfect - light weight blends with the skin.</li>
    <li> As good as any Estee Lauder or Lancôme product!!!!!!</li>
    <li> excellent as expected!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the original BOOTS No7 Tinted Moisturizer - Medium for years. It was the perfect color, evened my skin tone, and didn&#x27;t smell unpleasant or irritate my eyes. I ordered this, thinking I was getting the original. It&#x27;s not the same. The color is slightly orangey and it irritates my eyes. I can no longer find the original so they must have replaced a wonderful product with one I can&#x27;t use. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin looking shiny in a bad way, even oily, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the formula in general or just my bottle, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Coverage is very light, like it says. Moisturizes nicely though.</li>
    <li> First time user  of this product.  I like it, but feel I might need a better coverage due to the redness of my complexion.</li>
    <li> In the summer I am a fan of tinted moisturizer. It serves me well, I use moisturizer everyday, and this gives me more coverage than with moisturizer, only. It covers the spots I do not want as evidentiary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using a well known brand of tinted moisturizer that is double the price of Boots No7. I started using Boits No7 day moisturizing cream, and thought I would explore the tinted variety. I like it very much, it is light, does not feel greasy on my face, it is almost odorless, and it covers my face extremely well. I ordered fair, and that is exactly the color I needed. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to shake the container well. Since this comes in a tube like container I shook it up and down for a few seconds. However, I find this a little strange, I will look to see if the color or the moisturizer separates. This has an SPF of 15, which is decent. If you will be out in the direct sun for a period of time, the directions say yo replace every 15 mins. Hardly worth it, I think. This is a sheer color moisturizer, and it is excellent for my use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 06-13-15</li>
    <li> My go to favorite tinted moisturizer.  Not only does it has SPF protection it goes on beautifully and makes my skin look more radiant and well moisturized.</li>
    <li> Very natural looking with good coverage. It moisturizes well and lasts all day. I haven&#x27;t found a foundation that doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or dry on my skin, but this tinted moisturizer is just enough without looking heavy and feeling dry. When you&#x27;re in your sixties, you need something to smooth out the little discolorations, and this does it perfectly yet moisturizes, too. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of foundations and BB creams in the past few years, and this is the first thing that has worked for me. All the others were too dry. This is perfect. When I get home from work, I look in the mirror and I&#x27;m always amazed and how smooth and clear my skin looks. It lasts right up until I wash it off at night. I&#x27;ve even had some nights when I didn&#x27;t wash it off, and yet I haven&#x27;t had any clogged pores or breakouts. I always use a little loose powder over it to set it, and it stays all day long. I am going to keep using this product forever. I love it.</li>
    <li> Boots #7 Tinted Moisturizer is just what I was looking for. It provides a nice even coverage without the caked on look of foundation. I would recommend Boots # 7 Tinted Moisturizer to anyone who wants a radiant and even complexion.</li>
    <li> I mix this with my foundation (Chanel Aqua Vitalumiere) or wear it alone when I want very light coverage.  It&#x27;s a lovely product.  The fair is too light for me and the medium a tad too dark, so I bought both and then mixed for an exact match with my skin tone.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on $40 Laura Mercier tinted moisturizer. This stuff is a fourth of the price and is VERY good.</li>
    <li> I thought I had ordered the No7 Soft and Sheer in the white tube. That product is the best.  The product is ok, however it is not as creamy as the product in the white tube and I sometimes have a hard time getting it to blend smoothly.</li>
    <li> One of the best products not to heavy like liquid makeup</li>
