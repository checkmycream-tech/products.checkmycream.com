      <li>and I love it how it works.</li>
      <li>I asked the company several questions trying to determine what the best sponge for my skin type was</li>
      <li>I have only the highest praise for this wonderful sponge.</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved it the first 5 days, then it was a shriveled up sponge</li>
      <li>I also really love the fact that it is so easy to use, and the care is minimum</li>
      <li>and I feel so refreshed and clean!</li>
      <li>So I honestly didn&#x27;t know if I was doing it right or not.</li>
      <li>So easy to use</li>
      <li>Konjac sponge is incredibly easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use</li>
      <li>/&gt;Typically, I will use a washcloth that has dual uses – a scrubber side and a smooth side.</li>
      <li>It feel too smooth</li>
      <li>It got such great reviews I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope I get used to it.</li>
      <li>Our Konjac fiber is grown on the pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and</li>
      <li>Gentle and effective way of cleaning my face and neck.</li>
      <li>I think this is a good item for keeping your skin looking clear and splotch free.  </li>
      <li>A good sponge to use to wash your face and keep it looking clean and clear.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These clean and exfoliate with a very gentle surface, if you&#x27;re looking for something more abrasive, it might not be for you.</li>
      <li>Therefore, when I saw the konjac sponge by Oleavine, I was quite excited.</li>
      <li>It works great, and has a string attached so you can hand it to dry.</li>
      <li>and I struggle with my face ever feeling clean.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t feel it gets my face clean.</li>
      <li>I really liked this one, my skin felt soft and clean after using it.</li>
      <li>The first time it needs to soak in warm water, then the water needs to be pressed out of it between your hands, then you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
      <li>It is like sponge and you soak it in warm water until it becomes soft.</li>
      <li>But I have flaky skin from retin-a and need more aggressive exfoliation and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me at all.   </li>
      <li>This sponge is a lot bigger than I thought it would be...which is good for me.  </li>
      <li>Perfect sponge for my dry sensitive skin.</li>

      <li>Your skin feels clean, soft &amp; smooth after using these sponges!</li>
      <li>Makes it very easy to lightly exfoliate my face and especially the grooves along the side of the nose.  </li>

      <li>The shape was the same (and I love it!).</li>
      <li>I see that it is a new trend and was very excited when I got mine.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like these sponges a lot but the problem with them is that after a short while they usually develop a tear, which than gets bigger&lt;br /&gt;and bigger until the sponge is unusable. Too expensive. Tried it twice, same problem. Will not buy again</li>
    <li> A while back, I tried another konjac sponge and I had mixed feelings about it. The sponge was quite small and awkward to hold onto. Therefore, when I saw the konjac sponge by Oleavine, I was quite excited. It is infused with French red clay, which I think is different, as most products I see like this are infused with charcoal. While I have tried a lot of charcoal products and enjoy them, I was looking for something a little different. And the Konjac Sponge infused with French Red Clay was just that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with the teardrop shape of the sponge – it fits perfectly in my hand and it can be used for larger areas on your body. I do use the sponge on my face, but I also use it on my arms, where I have these little bumps and on my chest where I occasionally have some breakouts. I do not feel like the sponge is too large or too small. It does not slide out of my hand and it is not as if I am struggling to hold onto it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I will use a washcloth that has dual uses – a scrubber side and a smooth side. I am still using that, but for my face I am using the Konjac Sponge infused with French Red Clay. Due to the sponge having French red clay in it, you technically do not have to use any face wash, however I still do. I like knowing my face is extra clean – especially since I have oily skin and I struggle with my face ever feeling clean. Since I have been using this sponge, my face is feeling a little cleaner and healthier. I do not really know how well the French red clay is working, but I am loving the Konjac Sponge infused with French Red Clay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After quite a few uses of the sponge, it is holding up really well – there are no signs of it breaking down anytime soon. If you are looking to use a Konjac sponge, then I would definitely recommend this one! It is my favorite, at least of the two that I have tried. I will continue to use this until it starts breaking down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion. All the opinions expressed here are my own.*are my own.*</li>
    <li> One of the best sponges I have used. It leaves my skin feeling amazing. So easy to use</li>
    <li> Love my red clay sponge! Enough said!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of these products. I have a few different ones. I have them in the bathroom by the sink, in the shower as well as by the bathtub. My daughter loves to watch them go from hard to soft when she puts them under the water.</li>
    <li> It is a sponge you use to exfoliate your face. This is a routine Asian cultures exfoliated their skin for years. I am seeing this is a new trend for America. I saw this for the first time myself about six months. When you exfoliated your face with red clay sponge you are getting the blood flow and by doing that you are getting rid of acne.I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! This sponge is great for dry or if you have sensitive skin. If you use this lightly you could use this everyday. I would put it in microwave once a week for 2 mins to kill bacteria. You should replace your sponge every two to three months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these konjac sponges sponges on alternate days, the French Red Clay one day, followed by the Green Clay the next, without any cleanser at all. While both left my skin feeling soft and refreshed, for me, personally, the French Red Clay worked best--I found it to exfoliate my combination skin a little better than the Green Clay version and it left my skin smoother and tauter than when I started using it, without the drying effects of a stronger exfoliation product. Overall, totally worth the money! Pick one up and see for yourself!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and I have dry skin. I love this sponge!!</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this sponge! My face felt softer after using and exfoliated very well.  I recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> This is really a great product.  Very pleased with my purchase.  Additionally, the level of customer service from the seller is awesome.  Highly recommend both product and seller.</li>
    <li> love this sponge. its great to use instead of my clarisonic sometimes if i want more of a gentler cleansing. i haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin by using the french red clay sponge but overrall i really like using konjac sponges and will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Perfect sponge for my dry sensitive skin. I dont even need to use my cleanser with this.</li>
    <li> After one use I immediately felt like my skin was smoother &amp; cleaner.</li>
    <li> For a little sponge, this made my skin so soft! I never had a sponge make my skin this soft! Very good product! I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong, I loved this sponge...while it lasted :( I guess I expected it to last longer but even with good care (wet it, use it, hang it up to dry) even then, it only really felt amazing for the first three times I used it then it was just a sponge. I would Def call this a luxury item to source on every once in a while but not something I&#x27;ll be buying consistently.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!!! Not using my hand held rechargeable sonic skin cleanser anymore (without naming brand)...I feel this product  works so much better! And the cost is so reasonable! Not my first purchase, these were for friends!</li>
    <li> Sad to say. I absolutely loved it the first 5 days, then it was a shriveled up sponge I had spent 10 dollars on. I did every single thing that the instructions said to do to the letter. But unfortunately the love is gone. Along with whatever was IN that sponge that made my skin feel like a baby&#x27;s butt for 5 days. I&#x27;m still using it faithfully however. If I could get more of that french red clay I&#x27;d be in business. I think I&#x27;ll look around for some. But for now, I think it&#x27;s a fail for me.</li>
    <li> The facial sponge was delivered in a timely fashion.  Washing with this sponge is proving to be a great way to gently exfoliate the sensitive, mature, skin on my face.  I do not need to use cleansers to remove make-up, the sponge does it all.</li>
    <li> This sponge is exactly what I needed in my facial  skincare regiment. This helps keep my face smooth and soft. I use this with a gentle cleanser and I can see a difference.</li>
    <li> Works like it says it would.  Leave you feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I hadn&#x27;t used it myself. The thought of cleaning my face without soap and having it work seemed completely preposterous. I&#x27;ve been using the French Red Konjac sponge for several months now, and I could tell within the first week that it was working. I&#x27;m still stunned both by the difference in my skin and by the thought of how much I&#x27;ve needlessly spent on skin care products over the years. I was looking at sonic skin care cleaners when I happened upon this link, I am SO happy/elated/ecstatic that I did.&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac sponge is incredibly easy to use. The first time it needs to soak in warm water, then the water needs to be pressed out of it between your hands, then you&#x27;re ready to go. (Never wring out the sponge, it&#x27;ll wear it out quicker. There are very easy to follow instructions included). Then you wash your face with the sponge. (If it makes it easier, pretend there&#x27;s a cleanser on the sponge, so it won&#x27;t seem so weird NOT using a cleanser on your face). :)</li>
    <li> Package came quickly, and the sponge is as expected. I just don&#x27;t like the way it makes my face feel, and it dries out my skin. I have very balanced, but sensitive skin. Might work better on someone with oily or combination skin. And like other reviewers, it does not dry out overnight even if I squeeze it really well.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this sponge.  Makes it very easy to lightly exfoliate my face and especially the grooves along the side of the nose.  Very gentle for my mature skin.  Highly recommend and will purchase again.  I wash my face first with a gentle cleanser.  After finishing, I use this as step two with tap water.  Feel that my face is very clean ready for any treatment or cream I want to apply.</li>
    <li> The picture makes this sponge look .... I dunno, bigger.....more bulbous than it actually is.  It&#x27;s only about 1/4&amp;#34; in height.  It seems to be working as described.  My face does feel smoother and more hydrated after using this sponge than it did before that.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really feel like it is exfoliating my face.  It feel too smooth and I really can&#x27;t feel/see any difference on my face</li>
    <li> A good sponge to use to wash your face and keep it looking clean and clear.  I hate when I break out and my skin looks red and splotchy.  I think this is a good item for keeping your skin looking clear and splotch free.  It is easy to use and then you hang it to dry and if needed you can put it in the microwave to kill any germs and sterilize it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks great and it is easy to use.</li>
    <li> This sponge is a surprisingly good product: It made my skin look brighter and healthier after 2 uses. It&#x27;s not a miracle but the results are definitely noticeable. I will be repurchasing. :-)</li>
    <li> This sponge is a lot bigger than I thought it would be...which is good for me.  I cannot tell if there are any changes in my skin yet, but I like the convenience of this product.  Fast shipping.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Thethis is my second order for my mom. She just loves this sponge. Uses it everyday untill it feels like a rock.se sponges are perfect for my mom who loves to have fun in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love it!!! I will buy again!</li>
    <li> I recently had the opportunity to review a beauty sponge from Oleavine. Oleavine&#x27;s 100% Plant Based Konjac Sponges come in 4 choices: Bamboo Charcoal Infused, French Green Clay Infused, Original Pure White, and the one that I reviewed, French Red Clay Infused! Each one of them is used for a different purpose. They all gently exfoliate, deep clean, detoxify, refresh, and naturally moisturize. Per their site, &amp;#34; The Konjac used in our beauty sponge is grown on the volcanic plains of UNESCO protected Jeju Island in South Korea.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Bamboo Charcoal Infused sponge works best for oily and blemish prone skin.  It helps with getting rid of excess oils and with fighting the acne-causing bacteria.  The French Red Clay Infused sponge works best for dry, sensitive, and mature skin, by stimulating circulation and helping with skin regeneration. I really liked this one, my skin felt soft and clean after using it. No dryness at all! The best way that I could put it was like, WOW! A very gentle cleansing! To continue one with the next infused one... the French Green Clay Infused sponge helps to draw out excess oils, dirt and bacteria from the oily T-zone and combination skins. The Original Pure White can be used on anyone&#x27;s skin, even babies and children! It is so gentle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you do with the sponge is you rinse or soak it in order to get it to its full size, absorbing water. Next you cleanse your face with it by gently massaging it with the sponge. I didn&#x27;t use any cleansers with it, but you can if you choose. Rinse your face. and pat dry. Then you gently squeeze the sponge between your palms, no wringing it. You can air dry it by hanging it from the string on the top of it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend these!!</li>
    <li> I love these sponges!  I have tried a few of them and they really are a great addition to any skincare routine.  Lately, I have been using &amp; alternating between the White &amp; French Red Clay ones that Oleavine sent me to review for them for my blog, GlamRiver.&lt;br /&gt;These sponges are great at cleansing and exfoliating your skin and you can use them with or without a cleanser.  Your skin feels clean, soft &amp; smooth after using these sponges!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product! Just purchased more!</li>
    <li> I really was excited to try this product. I see that it is a new trend and was very excited when I got mine. It is like sponge and you soak it in warm water until it becomes soft. Directions mention that you can simply wash your face by just using the sponge or use it with a cleanser. I used it with a little bit of my daily cleanser. I loved my results. My face was very smooth and soft. It looked clear and felt wonderful. I use it everytime now. It is a natural product and I love using it in my beauty cleaning regimen.</li>
    <li> This is the coolest,best face sponge ever! It works great, and has a string attached so you can hand it to dry. I love it!</li>
    <li> I really like how it feels on my skin and afterward my skin feels really smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t exfoliating for me in any way. I don&#x27;t really like it and it holds bacteria like a giant sponge. It has not helped cleanse my face.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s ok.  Don&#x27;t feel it gets my face clean.</li>
    <li> Ok got his yesterday and love love love it!!!. I could feel after the first time i used it my skin really felt smooth..Would recommend.. Wish i would have gotten 2</li>
    <li> Just used it for the first time. These Oleavine All Natural Konjac Sponge French Red Clay works fantastic. The only thing that is it has a bit of a smell. But once you get past that. Then it&#x27;s the perfect face sponge. My face feels great. I will have to add it to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% NATURAL, ECO-FRIENDLY and BIODEGRADEABLE - We painstakingly evaluated countless Konjac sponges on the market before putting our reputation behind this beauty. Our Konjac fiber is grown on the pristine volcanic plains of Jeju Island in South Korea, free from chemicals, pollution and irritants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Wow. When I first received the Konjac Sponge I was impressed with the packaging, but concerned on how the sponge looked. It did not look like a sponge, but rather a pumice stone. So, I red the directions and got to testing it out. The next thing that got my attentions, was that it said I did not need any cleanser with it. Hmm....I thought. Put it in warm water and let it soak. After a short period of time, it really did get soft like a sponge. I decided to give it a try. I have been using this for a week now and I really can see the difference. I have very sensitive skin and really don&#x27;t like chemicals, so no cleaner is a plus. It really does work. The best part is that is biodegradable. You can even plant it with your plants. My skin has cleared up more and I feel like my moisturizer is working better. I am impressed. I received this product for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I bought this sponge based on the rave reviews and the fact that my skin is so sensitive.  I thought it would be great if I didn&#x27;t have to use any cleansers and could just rely on the sponge.  I thought the sponge would be more sturdy than it is.  I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with all of these other glowing reviews...but to me this just seems like a fragile sponge that you might get at the $1 tree.  When I try to cleanse my face with it, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is sturdy enough to do anything.  I&#x27;ll stick with the exfoliating cleansers for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have mature, dry, sensitive skin and, although my skin still needs gentle exfoliation on a regular basis to remain luminous, many physical and chemical exfoliants are simply way too harsh for me.  I bought a Konjac sponge out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised at how super gentle yet efficacious the sponge proved to be.  I typically wear a full face of makeup over a heavy duty physical sunscreen and so I still prefer my cleansing oil at night, but my morning routine now consists of using the Konjac sponge with tepid water.  That&#x27;s it!  My skin is left gently exfoliated, soft and smooth to the touch, refined in appearance, and my serums sink in in the blink of an eye.  I have only the highest praise for this wonderful sponge.</li>
    <li> I have and love the Bamboo Charcoal Infused Konjac Sponge so I was excited to try the French Red Clay one! The shape was the same (and I love it!). I have been using this one without a cleanser and I feel so refreshed and clean! French Red Clay is known for ability to stimulate blood circulation and accelerate skin regeneration, leaving radiant and hydrated skin. Fantastic for all, but especially effective for Dry, Sensitive or Mature Skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt pretty much the same way as I did about the Bamboo Charcoal - since I knew that the hard pumice looking thing would turn into a super soft sponge, I immediately added water. I really do love the shape. The larger end is great for larger surface areas like cheeks and the small end is great to get in harder to reach, smaller areas like next to your nose or around your eyes. I actually don&#x27;t use cleanser with this one and it makes me feel like I don&#x27;t need to anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I received this in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion. All thoughts and opinions expressed here are 100% my own***</li>
    <li> Great sponge, interesting texture but I&#x27;m used to it now. My skin looks great because the sponge cleans without being abrasive. It&#x27;s not easy to dry well which is my only complaint, so I do worry that it will get moldy.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to buy this! It feels absolutly amazing on my face with nothing on the sponge .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t like it so far.  I don&#x27;t see how something so soft can possibly exfoliate,  and it&#x27;s so squishy and slippery it&#x27;s hard to hang onto securely enough to direct it where you need it to go.  It got such great reviews I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope I get used to it. Update: So after using this sponge for a week or so I don&#x27;t like it any better.  I think if you have sensitive skin it&#x27;s probably great.  But I have flaky skin from retin-a and need more aggressive exfoliation and this doesn&#x27;t really work for me at all.   Also,  I bought one of the round ones to try and found it&#x27;s much easier to hang onto.  Anyway I&#x27;m going back to my good old mesh shower gloves for my face because they work way better.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Gentle and effective way of cleaning my face and neck.</li>
    <li> I love love this sponge! I use it every day and every night. I used to use cotton, cloth towels, but nothing works like this sponge. I put a little bit of Olay&#x27;s 2 in 1 dual action cleanser+toner with cucumber extract and it cleans my face perfectly! For my eyes I use an eye make up remover and I love it how it works. Will never go back to cotton or cloth towels.</li>
    <li> **I received this product in return for an honest review. All opinions are my own.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Originally I will admit that I was somewhat skeptical with the thought of only needing a sponge infused with red clay as the only thing I need to wash my face. Even the thought of just using a small amount of facial cleanser because I had a regiment of cleaners that I used nightly. I was surprised how large the sponge was since it was larger than the palm of my hand. It appeared hard and looked as if it had the same consistency as a pumice stone. I followed the directions and allowed it to soak in water and I was amazed with how soft and smooth it was. There was no foaming and almost seemed to glide across my skin. So I honestly didn&#x27;t know if I was doing it right or not. However it is working! My skin is much cleaner with no scrubbing or harsh abrasives and even feels softer. I also really love the fact that it is so easy to use, and the care is minimum you just gently press it between your hands to press the water out and hang it up to dry.  I asked the company several questions trying to determine what the best sponge for my skin type was and they were prompt and super helpful with all their answers. While I may not have heard of this product before I used it, it is now a daily part of my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> What can I say?  I love Konjac sponges.  I have rosacea and sensitive skin and these give me a very clean, fresh face without irritation.  I haven&#x27;t truly noticed any difference between the different color/ingredient combos (red clay, pink clay, charcoal, tumeric, etc.) - but they&#x27;re all the same price and they all work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clean and exfoliate with a very gentle surface, if you&#x27;re looking for something more abrasive, it might not be for you.</li>
    <li> I liked this for the most part, my complaint is I wish it gave a hook to hang up with, I really had no where to let it hang. I know I could have gone out and got something at the dollar store, but when the directions tell you you have to hang it up, I think it should provide that since showers do not come with hooks</li>
