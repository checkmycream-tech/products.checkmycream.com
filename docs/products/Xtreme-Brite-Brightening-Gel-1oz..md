      <li>stuff REALLY works.</li>
      <li>I am uncertain if you are supposed to use more with a longer period of time, however, this did not much of anything for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It took about 2 weeks, but I can without a doubt tell that the patches are MUCH lighter than what they were before.</li>
      <li>but this product really didn&#x27;t work well with my skin.</li>
      <li>I recommend it to whoever wants to lighten the skin</li>
      <li>IT REALLY  </li>
      <li>I used it for one month after every shower, and after 4 weeks you could really see a result</li>
      <li>I used the whole tube and it just did nothing, no Lightening,</li>
      <li>I have not suffered any breakouts but it can causing peeling (can be very drying), so I use it sparingly twice a day after cleansing and toning.</li>
      <li>wish the tube was bigger for the price but definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for fast results.</li>
      <li>By week three, the spots were clearly fading back to my original skin color.</li>

<li> I was peeling and everything, did not help the dark marks went back to natural lighteners.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t wanna pay close to $40 for a 1 ounce ointment that does not last long.</li>
<li> Just apply and rub (not with pressure) on your neck or underarms and let it completely dry before moving on with your daily routine.</li>
<li> But as far as lightning my darker areas not so much.it actually seemed to darken my trouble areas.</li>
<li> Remember to loofah and exfoliate the areas which really helps get rid of the dark dead skin which this gel removes.</li>
<li> I used it for anal bleaching and it burned a bit there are no directions on it about time and how long to wear it</li>
<li> A drop goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I have purchased it twice due to it only being 1 oz.</li>
<li> Overall, it works but definitely not consistent.</li>
<li> going to dry ur face and going to turn into darker and ur underarms going to peel and also going to turn into darker color...</li>
<li> It is painful not being able to lift up arms in public or having noticeable discoloration on the face.</li>
<li> It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away.</li>
<li> However, once I&#x27;ve stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark.</li>
<li> I have one, half used tube left.</li>
<li> Such a waste of money.</li>
<li> The only reason it isn&#x27;t one star is that since I did miss a few days I have to give benefit of the doubt...</li>
<li> and I noticed that it improves my underarm skin color and after using it regularly, 2x a day for everyday for 1 month and the skin color whitens.</li>
<li> Always put just one thin layer on cleansed toned skin, never double up in one sitting, it will irritate my skin, and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d suggest mixing it in some kind of cream/oil base.  </li>
<li> My plan is to use it sparingly at night once the spots are gone (or nearly gone) and use a serious sunscreen during the day.</li>
<li> /&gt;Remember: a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> ive been using it for a month, but im not consistent</li>
<li> Might work for other people.</li>
<li> but again I didn&#x27;t have extreme transformation.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the only thing that seems to work on lightening my underarms and old scars. I like it because it does not contain hydroquinone (not sure if I spelled it right) and I saw changes after 1 week of use. 4 stars because it is very small, lasts about a month and as soon as I stopped using, my troubled areas went back to square one! I have purchased it twice due to it only being 1 oz. &amp; it actually worked. I would like to know why this item keeps getting expensive. I don&#x27;t wanna pay close to $40 for a 1 ounce ointment that does not last long.</li>
    <li> I bought Xtreme Brite to lighten my skin. I&#x27;m an athlete, so over the game season my skin has become burnt and blotchy. I received this product two days after I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been using this for say, about four days now, and I can already tell the difference. I had small little bumps all over my cheeks since forever, and they&#x27;re disappearing! My skin tone is evener now, and paler. I use Aveeno Positively Radiant cleanser as well as Clean and Clear Morning Burst Scrub, and boy can I tell you, this stuff works!  One small downside is that the gel may tingle a little, just like any other acne treatment, after you apply it, but it&#x27;s nothing major. It dries out my skin as well, but I just put on lotion. Also, most of the ingredients are extracts from plants, like licorice root extract, bearberry, and strawbery tree (who knew?) extract. I love it.</li>
    <li> this product did absolutely nothing, and what is so weird about it is that I buy this product all the time at my beauty store, this had got to have been a knock off or something, I threw it away after a few weeks, will not be purchasing this product from amazon again</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t use it past a week. The reason why is that it&#x27;s smelled kind of funny. will look for another product that doesn&#x27;t smell so perfumy.</li>
    <li> I have noticed no lightening to dark spots on my skin at all.  I put it on twice a day (most days) but got no results.  The only reason it isn&#x27;t one star is that since I did miss a few days I have to give benefit of the doubt...but this product really didn&#x27;t work well with my skin.</li>
    <li> I had tried at least five other products to reduce the appearance of dark sun/age spots (I am a light-skinned African-American). Xtreme Brite gel made a difference in the first week. By week three, the spots were clearly fading back to my original skin color. I have seen others&#x27; reviews concerning re-darkening of the skin after you cease to use the product. My plan is to use it sparingly at night once the spots are gone (or nearly gone) and use a serious sunscreen during the day. I am grateful for this product because it is reasonably priced and effective. It may not work for everyone, but it worked for me.</li>
    <li> This gell did nothing at all. I religiously put it on specific areas for weeks and nothing changed. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR TIME</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks and I saw no improvements. I would not recommend this product. It is a  waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am african american and love my color!!! i only ordered this because i grow facial hair (female) and i have dark spots from excessive plucking!! well this stuff caused my dark spots to lighten up!!! my skin did go through this peeling phase but once the old dead skin peeled off the new skin was perfect.  i have stop using due to the spots becoming lighter than my regular pigment, but it works!!! i hope nobody buys this cause they hate what GOD gave them, this is used to enhance or fix some problem spots...I pitty the fool who does not know the truth and how important Melain is in the skin!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product about 3 months ago, I finished my tube of xtreme  brite, as soon as I was almost done with the product I started seeing results. As I applied the gel in a circular motion i was doing so, I started to see dirt like skin come off. It was incredible :) as of today my arm pits are still white, well as they should look.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to get rid of the dark spots I had on my face due to acne scars and it did help a bit.&lt;br /&gt;My dark spots aren&#x27;t quite as noticeable but they&#x27;re still there.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a lot of good reviews on this product, I wish it would have worked better.</li>
    <li> I only used it for 3 days and it made my skin itchy and red. It maybe because of my skin type. Might work for other people.</li>
    <li> Such a waste of money. It made my skin so dark that it took me months to get it back to the original color. Was shipped on time but ruined my skin.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it its junk and don&#x27;t use it on ur face or underarms... going to dry ur face and going to turn into darker and ur underarms going to peel and also going to turn into darker color...</li>
    <li> great product, it actually works. noticed imperfection improvements within two weeks. wish the tube was bigger for the price but definitely worth it if you&#x27;re looking for fast results.</li>
    <li> ive been using it for a month, but im not consistent so im not seeing great diff, but its fading away my spots nicely.</li>
    <li> Good product. Use a little bit on your spot and the next day its already shedding the first layer of skin. By the 3 rd day the spot is almost gone. Cant get these results from the most expensive products</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t seen any changes after using it for two weeks, but I guess not all people r the same, m</li>
    <li> Helped with hyper-pigmentation that occurred over the course of pregnancy. I used under breasts and down stomach line. My skin is back to what is was prior to pregnancy. However I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for naturally dark areas of body. Also, I used once I stopped breast feeding to reduce any risk associated to my milk supply. Also i never used during pregnancy.</li>
    <li> I HATE this product it was a waste of my. $14.00 bucks I want my money back. It made my skin darker and it burnt my skin..I was so mad , it fell twice in the.garbage.bin so that was.a sign to me.to.not.even.give it another.day..Waste of money time and patience. .DO NOT BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my skin. Used as suggested and no signs of brightness. Wish it worked for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for me. Stings when I put it on. I used the whole tube and it just did nothing, no Lightening, no Brightening,......NOTHING. Also it tends to dry out my skin and made my face feel weird the next day. I stuck with it hoping it would LIGHTEN,.....but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I am asian and have combination skin. I use this on my face to eliminate sun spots and acne spot. I have been using it for a month now and I no longer need to dap concealer on these spots. Regular foundation covers it now. I have not suffered any breakouts but it can causing peeling (can be very drying), so I use it sparingly twice a day after cleansing and toning. I put it on before my moisturizer, let it dry as it is pretty sticky feeling. It dries to a non-sticky touch in less than a few minutes. Then I moisturize. I do a 20% salicylic acid peel once a month, this helps my products works more effectively. Always put just one thin layer on cleansed toned skin, never double up in one sitting, it will irritate my skin, and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I order this cream along with their soap. It actually worked for me but after I finished the tube, I ordered different brand just to get quicker results (BAD IDEA). I am definitely ordering 3 more tubes so that my underarm pigment gets treated completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition:: experience after the use of 4 tubes and 2 soap bars. (August 2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it has been over a year since, I have been using this product on and off. I did purchase  the trio of these tubes. I have one, half used tube left. Honestly, I don&#x27;t use it that often thou but yes my skin did improve a lot. With first tube, I didn&#x27;t have any sort of peeling because I have really oily skin. With the continuous use of my 2nd and 3rd tube my skin started peeling. Since I had pigmented underarms and area around the mouth, I used it religiously for the first 3 months or so. Did see the results but again I didn&#x27;t have extreme transformation. My pigmentation is more acceptable now. I do wear tank tops and mouth area is 1 or 2 shades darker than my actual skin tone. It did work for me and for the price I have paid, I am really please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason, I stopped using it because my skin started getting used to it at some point. I knew that I was ready for the next level. I needed something more advanced than this formula. I did some research and came across chemical peels. I have been doing professional peels twice a year and also home based mild chemical peels as well. Since, 80% of discoloration has been taken care of, I barley even use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you, who have discoloration issues, I know how it feels. I have been in your shoes for the longest time. It is painful not being able to lift up arms in public or having noticeable discoloration on the face. I have golden/yellow undertone. I used to be Mac NC42 and now I am Mac NC40. My over all skin tone gotten lighten by a shade at least. Anyways, I am not advertising  any brand or product but I am coming off more as an helping hand. If you have same issues as I had, give it try and if you ready to step up your game, try chemical peels as well for better, faster and permanent results. If you can&#x27;t handle chemical by yourself, seek professional help. There are products out their to actually help us and they do work with patience and consistent use.try and if you ready to step up your game, try chemical peels as well for better, faster and permanent results.

    <li> This really worked for me, however it did take 2-3 months to see a huge difference. dont be disappointed if you dont get result instantly, continue using it on a daily basis. I wasnt able to keep up daily as I skipped few days in a week. Just apply and rub (not with pressure) on your neck or underarms and let it completely dry before moving on with your daily routine. This is my 2nd tube and I hope my last :) Remember to loofah and exfoliate the areas which really helps get rid of the dark dead skin which this gel removes.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying that I use expensive, department store products on my face. Philosophy, Bosia, etc...I have, over the year, like many women in their mid-thirties developed brown patches on my face. I have used several &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products, yogurt masks, lemon juice, etc..but nothing worked. I might add that I have moderate rosacea, so it is tricky to treat these patches because my skin is sensitive. After reading some reviews, and based on the price, I bought this. It took about 2 weeks, but I can without a doubt tell that the patches are MUCH lighter than what they were before. The best part is, it does not irritate my skin. Overall my skin looks healthier since I have been using this product. I am consdering buying more from the xtreme brite line. The only thing is the smell is a tad peculiar.</li>
    <li> Best product ever it has really worked for me it has cleared my skin by like 3 shades lighter I recommend it to whoever wants to lighten the skin</li>
    <li> went from 11 dollars to 45dollars. I don&#x27;t need it bye</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd tube i ordered. I must say it really whitens underarm.  When i gave birth, the hormonal changes are still apparent so i used this product and I noticed that it improves my underarm skin color and after using it regularly, 2x a day for everyday for 1 month and the skin color whitens. I also noticed that after just a week of usage, there is a noticeable change already. I sent one to my sister who also loves it . Now, Im just using it 2x a week for maintenance. Great product. No allergies for me.</li>
    <li> I used this product for 3 weeks now and I can see nice results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for everyone have dark armpits</li>
    <li> I got this for blemishes, it works well.</li>
    <li> Must use it religiously/consistently to see results.</li>
    <li> I used it for anal bleaching and it burned a bit there are no directions on it about time and how long to wear it</li>
    <li> Been using it since I received it. Haven&#x27;t seen any difference! It also came with no directions on how often to use it. It was a waste of my money. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
    <li> absolutely terrible. not only were the ingredients not listed, there were no instructions! i bought it hoping to reduce hyperpigmentation but it only made my spots DARKER! my skin became irritated and red and i had to toss it after 2 days. waste of money.</li>
    <li> When used regularly, it does well keeping my skin clear, but has to be applied with consideration to the rest of your facial regiment. I don&#x27;t advise using this after an exfoliating scrub, especially if it contains Salicylic Acid. I also don&#x27;t apply it every day, and I find it&#x27;s also less uncomfortable when accompanied with a hemp moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember: a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This stuff made me break out bad. I stopped using it after 2 weeks. It was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> i got this to get rid of a scar and it did just that, if you are looking to remove any discoloration (spot) this will get rid of it, i dont know about putting it all over your face but it def work for a spot</li>
    <li> It burned me face. I was peeling and everything, did not help the dark marks went back to natural lighteners.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that its a gel.  A drop goes a long way.  it has a fantastic feel and smell.  My skin feels so tingly and looks so clear an I missed the glow the younger skin, and now I have it back.  I really like this and I am going to order another one as soon as I finish  this review.  I definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS AWSOME.yOU DO HAVE TO USE IT EVERYDAY FOR RESULTS.bUT OVER ALL IT REALLY  DID WORK FOR ME.</li>
    <li> I am uncertain if you are supposed to use more with a longer period of time, however, this did not much of anything for me.</li>
    <li> This peals the skin which I didnt like because I dont want my skin to peal while people have to see me and be around me which is a everyday thing for everyone I was looking for something that doesnt peal the skin</li>
    <li> It clear up my dark blemish and i soooooo have to purchase more from this line. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this product. When I first started using it, I can see and feel the difference. It actually started to literally peel the dark skin away. There&#x27;s a bit of a sting but that&#x27;s how I know it was working. My skin was lighter in just a couple weeks! However, once I&#x27;ve stopped using it when I reached my desired skin color, it went back to being dark. I applied more and suddenly it was no longer working. It didn&#x27;t peel or sting. I wonder what went wrong or if it has an expiration date or something. Overall, it works but definitely not consistent.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, just leave my arm pit sticky. I never notice any change with it.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s working well- It&#x27;s only been a week or two-- Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin- I&#x27;d suggest mixing it in some kind of cream/oil base.  I&#x27;m using Vitamin E oil and Jojoba oil to prevent irritation of my skin</li>
    <li> This product was OK as far as smell and the gel texture. But as far as lightning my darker areas not so much.it actually seemed to darken my trouble areas. I used it for about a month. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product all the way from Germany, because i saw a rating of in on youtube, so i wanted to try it. I used it without the soap. I applied it on my underarms as they were really dark. I used it for one month after every shower, and after 4 weeks you could really see a result - first my underarms were way to light, then i stopped using it for about two weeks. And now i use it 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff REALLY works. I love it. As soon as this tube is empty i will order the next one right away. :) Thanks. I can finally enjoy the summer down here without being ashamed of my dark armpits.</li>
