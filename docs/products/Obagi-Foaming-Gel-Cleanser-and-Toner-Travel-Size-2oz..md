      <li>I just love the Obagi line of products!  </li>
      <li>and I have noticed that I do not have any break outs at all any more!  </li>
      <li>Fabulous!</li>
      <li>Great to keep in your travel bag and ready to go.</li>
      <li>These are the perfect smaller size for travel.  </li>
      <li>Have used products for six years and feel they are foundational to healthy skin.</li>
      <li>Love Obagi products and love the travel size of the cleanser and toner.  </li>
      <li>Authentic Obagi products.</li>
      <li>I was very excited to find the Obagi cleansing gel and toner since I had purchased a kit from my dermotaligist</li>
      <li>I received my order very fast and it was packaged nicely in bubble wrap and the seal was still on the products.</li>
      <li>The toner is refreshing and the cleanser is gentle.</li>
      <li>Thanks!!</li>
      <li>but one of those things that for me, the convenience was worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Keep your skin care items and cosmetics with you on board with these just right bottles.  </li>
      <li>For Obagi users, each step is important, and I love the small sizes to use in the shower or put inside the medicine cabinet.  </li>
      <li>Same great product in a little package.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin look so much brighter</li>
      <li>real plus.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>These duos are so much more convenient than having to purchase the entire set just to get the travel size cleanser and toner because, even though I use all the products, I don&#x27;t use everything at the same rate.</li>
      <li>This is a great deal for the travel size and it last because you only need very little to cover your entire face.</li>
      <li>More than enough for, at least, a month&#x27;s travel.</li>
      <li>This travel pack was kind of expensive</li>
