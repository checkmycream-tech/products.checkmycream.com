<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i like this smell, sweet and long lasting,perfect</li>
    <li> Mother in law will be so excited at Christmas! ! Can&#x27;t find this in stores and its her fave :) shipping was fast and packaged very well...would definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I first started wearing Sun, Moon, Stars in high school and ten years later it&#x27;s still a favorite of mine. The scent is exotic and sultry while still being light and feminine, not unlike the sun, moon and stars themselves. Great for day or night use. The bottle it comes in is one of the most gorgeous I&#x27;ve seen and is like a little piece of art in itself. I would recommend this to women of any age, it&#x27;s simply wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this on and off for  over 15 years and I always come back to it.  Every single time I wear this, I get compliments- especially from men who want to know what it is.  I&#x27;ve had men walk up to me and inhale deeply and fall into a deep trance like state.  I&#x27;m not exaggerating!  They want more and more! ( Too bad they are married..hahaha)  I don&#x27;t care for most perfumes because they literally gag me, smell stale and astringent, give me a headache and honestly, I don&#x27;t know how so many of the current fragrances could be the least bit appealing to anyone.  This fragrance is unique, classic, has a spicy warmth that cloaks you like a soft cashmere blanket. The soft fruity spicy floral does not change from initial spray to dry down.  It&#x27;s not a fragrance that you can wear too much of but you don&#x27;t need much and it lasts. I would recommend it as a fall/winter scent but you could wear it anytime of year since it smells so exotic and somewhat tropical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here is a description of it:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Sun Moon Stars by Karl Lagerfeld Perfume. Enjoy the scintillating and perfectly blended aromas of water lily, peach, pineapple, bergamot and rose&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My senses detect the pineapple/peach which sweetens the floral elements of the rose and water lily.  I don&#x27;t really notice the bergamot which is odd because I don&#x27;t care for bergamot perfumes and would notice it if it were a dominant element.</li>
    <li> i picked this up recently for a very good price.  i was mostly interested in the pretty bottle for decorating my dresser, but thought the perfume smelled nice too.  i sprayed a little on my wrist to see how it smelled on.  at first i thought it was much too strong and heady, too much cloying floral.  but the scent quickly mellows as it warms to your skin, and the top notes fade away.  whats left is a lovely, soft scent that lasts and lasts.  it wont jump out at anyone, but its nice to pick up a little whiff now and again.  its been over a day since i put it on  last and i can still smell the scent on my skin.  it is slightly vanilla and powder without being overly sweet.  i really enjoy it.  i sometimes combine it with a fruity clean scent i have and its a very nice combination.</li>
    <li> Bought a product in excelent price. Package arrived in perfect conditions and before the estimated date of arrival. Gave it to my wife as a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I have worn this Lagerfeld fragrance for years.  I bought it once, based on the name:&lt;br /&gt;Sun Moon Stars...so ethereal. (and i love the deep blue bottle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light but romantic.  Feminine without being too sweet or overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;And i often get compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime i try another fragrance, i come running back to soft, soothing Sun Moon Stars.</li>
    <li> Wear this perfume for a long long time and still love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this is original. Though it smells similar, something is different and almost pungent after first spraying. Love the bottle though.</li>
    <li> Awful. Smells nothing like it should. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I discovered Sun Moon and Stars several years ago; but for whatever reason I could no longer find it in our local stores. Nothing on the market today remotely resembles this fragrance. Most cologne will fade; requiring you to reapply, not this, one would think it was perfume. I have a few select fragrances which I normally wear, this is a staple. I would highly recommend anyone who desires to stand out a bit to try this, but be ready for, \\&quot;What are you wearing?\\&quot; and \\&quot;where can I get it?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My former review was dated several years ago; and I wish to speak to the issue regarding Sun, Moon and Stars having changed its fragrance; I do not find that to be the case. I just received my latest purchase of the 100 ml/3.3oz size, and its scent is the same as the day it was discovered. I&#x27;ve been w/ out for several weeks; and today three people have already given positive comments. I cannot speak to those who feel it is not their personal choice, but as someone who wears this fragrance on a regular basis, I can assure those who normally do purchase SMS; it&#x27;s scent is the same as it was 16 years ago, still fresh and appealing, if it is ones fragrance of choice.</li>
    <li> Great perfume! I use to wear it and I&#x27;m glad I got it again.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume in my early 20&#x27;s &amp; it was my absolutely FAV back then! The stores here stopped selling it &amp; when I found it here on Amazon I was SOOOO THRILLED! It was delivered very quickly, packaged safely &amp; I can not beat the price ANYWHERE! &#x3D;)  I have ordered 4 bottles of perfume in the last 4 months &amp; will continue to order more. GREAT for gifts as well! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Enjoy this perfume very much. Smells really good. Flowery smell.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and was very happy to find it on Amazon in the bigger oz for a very low price.  I love the scent and it stays on for a long time.  I received in just 4 days which is great.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It has a soft earthy flowery smell that is really unique. I absolutely adore the bottle it comes in. I hope this product will always be available to purchase.</li>
    <li> I like some of the others have worn this for years. I started wearing it in high school and searched high and low for it when it left stores. I tried to find other fragrances to replace it, but nothing else fits me better. It is very lovely and soft without being overally floral. I have had people ask for years what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife shortly after we got married in 1995. She was upset that I spent $100 on an ounce of perfume.  Now 20 years later it is still her favorite.  She described it as a sophisticated floral bouquet. This bottle is the same long lasting unique fragrance I have bought over the years at department stores.</li>
    <li> I love the smell.  My package came in a timely fashion.  I believe smell must match personality and body and this one matches mine.  Yay me!</li>
    <li> My stepmom loves this stuff! I have to search for it every holiday time!</li>
    <li> I have worn this for many years but it is getting harder to find now. I have always gotten compliments on it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to wear it as long as I can find it. JM, Atlanta, Ga.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this perfume. My aunt gave me a bottle about 10 years ago and it quickly became my signature scent. I haven&#x27;t been able to find it and I&#x27;ve missed it! Got me a big 3 oz bottle and the price was amazing.  Thank you again.</li>
    <li> HAVE WORN KL SUN MOON STARS IN THE PAST AND THE SCENT REMAINED MOST OF THE DAY. DONT KNOW IF IT WAS THIS PARTICULAR BOTTLE, BUT THIS ORDER HAD A VERY MILD , SHORT LASTING SCENT, HARDLY LIKE THE ONE I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO WEARING. EITHER THIS WAS A KNOCKOFF IMPOSTER VERSION OR A VERY OLD BOTTLE!!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this scent when I stumbled across it on Amazon.  In the 90&#x27;s I really wanted this badly, but never got it.  I remembered liking it but not what it smelled like. I got it today and instantly was in LOVE!! This is an amazing scent! It smells like nothing popular right now- very clean and beautiful. I was also lucky to get such a great price on the 3.3 oz. bottle:) Love this stuff and is easily my new signature scent.</li>
    <li> They haven&#x27;t made this in a while, so I was worried about purchasing it. It arrived well packaged. I gave it to my mom as a gift and she says it is just like it used to be and is still her favorite. So, YAY!</li>
    <li> I like this scent.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  It has a spicy sort of scent.</li>
    <li> But then perfume is a preference &amp; your body make up.  I bought this 2 years ago, big bottle, and it&#x27;s still as good as the first day.  Did not lose its fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is the original perfume and not a knockoff. It came packed just like in the department store and smelled perfect! The bonus..... Paying half the price, free shipping, and no sales tax!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Hard to describe it but smells great and lasts long too!  I like the name of it &amp; even the bottle.  Pretty smell!</li>
    <li> Love this slightly spicy scent!! Happy to have found it here.  Arrived in time with great presentation box.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing perfume. All of the family loves it. We tried getting it here, which is no problem. But Perfumaina was out. Sorry if I spelt the store name wrong. Please go with amazon so you really don&#x27;t have to go to &amp;#34;The Mall&amp;#34; for anything. Saves you some gas in your car too.</li>
    <li> Excellent purchase &amp; delivery time.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping ,very good quality .</li>
    <li> This perfume has been one of my favorites for a while and with that in mind,&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s has been a complete mission looking for it. When found it on&lt;br /&gt;amazon I was so ecstatic and bought it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a beautiful scent for when going out&lt;br /&gt;or if you just feel like dabbing some on for work. It is&lt;br /&gt;a bit strong so I suggest not so much but whatever works for you.&lt;br /&gt;Also for this particular scent I don&#x27;t suggest for all ages maybe early 20&lt;br /&gt;and 30s women.</li>
    <li> I use have this fragrance years ago but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s changed throughout the yrs but the fragrance is horrible.</li>
    <li> This perfume is very hard to fnd, really surprised to find it on  line.</li>
    <li> Still a beautiful and unforgettable scent that brings back so many memories. So sad it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I love this and will order more I have gotten numerous compliments on wearing this scent.</li>
    <li> I have this perfume and my daughter uses it all the time and comments how nice it is..&lt;br /&gt;so now she has her own.</li>
    <li> Here is another heavier scented fragrance that I like and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume about 10 years ago, and had actually forgotten all about until I saw it listed on Amazon.  The scent is very light, but has great staying power.  Most things fade on me, but this one remains throughout the day.  It&#x27;s described as a floral scent, but on me I can hint more of the sandalwood and amber.  I don&#x27;t particularly like floral scents, but this one is so unique and subtle.  I was so excited that I could get the full-size 3.3 oz bottle for around $20 with Prime shipping!  And the bottle is beautiful; unlike anything else out right now.</li>
    <li> I have been using this perfume for many years.  When I first started using it I received many compliments and to this day people still ask what I have on.  Very pleasant, soft.  Working in the food and drink business you can&#x27; wear anything overpowering.  Great for at night also.</li>
    <li> Bought for a friend and she loved it and was shocked at the price being so low.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It&#x27;s a little mystical, a little spicy, a little musky. Not fruity or floral at all and just the right &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; to last and not be overwhelming.</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume after reading the reviews on Amazon. I&#x27;m not understanding how people find this perfume attractive at all. No one in my household likes it either. It smells worst than dog poo to me and honestly...no one could even PAY me to wear this. Worst part- not returnable to Amazon.</li>
    <li> I used to have an imposter of this perfume back in the early 90&#x27;s and I loved it. Then it suddenly dissapeared. I love it because it is a strong scent that last all day. Every time I like a perfume, it seems likeit gets disscontinued. One of my favorites of the 80&#x27;s &amp; 90&#x27;s was Scoundrel by Coty or Revlon and I think Joan Collins used to advertise it? Please let me know if you can get this fragrance?</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cologne!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> love it!  It is my all time favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> well thank you very much</li>
    <li> I tried this cologne 18 years ago and continue to wear it. I always get compliments. Love that it is not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I ordered this spray for my Mom. She had a hard time finding it in stores. It liteeally arrived the next day at her home and I did not ask for overnight service. She was so happy and I was too cause I have never been disappointed with any of my orders from Amazon!</li>
    <li> After reading all the feedback on this perfume I decided to give it a try. Am terribly disappointed in it, when I first spray it on you can smell it for about 5 minutes then nothing. Unfortunately it just didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I do not feel the scent stays with you. I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> excelente producto muy recomendado la entrega fue rapida y la calidad del producto es original..en lo particular me gustan mucho esta marca</li>
    <li> smells very bad,I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t return it.  I bought it because I was rreading all these positive comments,I really don&#x27;t understand why people like it so much.</li>
    <li> My fav and the price is right!</li>
    <li> this product was a great price.  the size is the bottle is huge for what i paid.  i would recommend this item to others.</li>
    <li> Hi - we bought this for our aunt for Christmas. She hasn&#x27;t been able to find this in any retail stores around her house. So when she opened this up, she was very overwhelmed. I haven&#x27;t personally smelled this perfume but she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used Sun Moon and Stars by Laugerfield for many years. It is my signature scent. This purchase was a gift to my oldest daughter and she was delighted. The price was very reasonable so I ordered an extra for me.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this as a teenager and have not been able to find it in stores. Love it just as much now as I did then.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this perfume! It has a long lasting smell. I have been purchasing this perfume for years. My favorite perfume ever!!!</li>
    <li> Soft, not overpowering or suggestive, not overwhelmingly alcohol-based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this for  - don&#x27;t laugh - doctor visits!  Up close and personal, I don&#x27;t want the docs offended by any chance odor - it actually seems to be OK to both the lady and men doc&#x27;s I see. (Moi have an odor? Perish the thought, right?) It is light enough to apply a full spray to both my nape underneath hair and to panty area (stop laughing!) without knocking anyone out - no allergic response or complaint from anyone yet.</li>
    <li> Sun Moon Stars has a very distinct and pleasant scent that is not as flowery as other scents that I might use during the week.  This fragrance lasts throughout  the day too.  The cost of this product was reasonable for the spray bottle which is a nice size bottle compared to many you will find for a modest price.</li>
    <li> I am very particular about what cologne I wear. I have been using Sun Moon Star for over 15 yrs, along with Lauren. The quality has always remained excellent!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over 15 years and I still get amazing compliments every time I go out. I was very upset when they discontinued it on the market but the silver lining is now that you can get it online it makes it a bit unique. I love knowing I am not going to run into someone else wearing this specific brand. I just hope that it is never discontinued completely, I would be so heartbroken.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite fragrances. I have worn this fragrance for years and glad that I now have the opportunity to wear it again.</li>
    <li> Love the spicy-sweet smell. Ive been wearing it for about 10 years.  I really have to ration it because the bottle keeps getting &amp;#34;mysteriously&amp;#34; lower with a family of all girls.  Its really sad that its discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this perfume, its not overpowering, a nice classic fragrance, the price was great too! Always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> i just love it. a wonderful smell, takes me back to 1978 when my boyfriend got it for me</li>
    <li> A SCENT THAT IS HARD TO FIND THAT I LOVE</li>
    <li> As described and the shipping was quick! I love this perfume!</li>
    <li> I have loved this for years and I only recently ran out and discovered how difficult it is to find it in stores.  I was very happy to see it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent, reasonably priced! I&#x27;ve loved this product for several years now.  Would recommend it to any woman to try!</li>
    <li> I love Sun Moon Star perfume.  I&#x27;ve worn nothing but this perfume since I was like 18!  I was so happy to find it on Amazon since I can no longer find any reasonable prices locally.  Why pay $60 at the Mall?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the scent but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible.  Everyone loves this perfume.  I&#x27;ve had to write down the name for other people more times than I can count.</li>
    <li> Thrilled to find it on your website.</li>
    <li> Wife loved the fragrance.  Excellent value</li>
    <li> excellent product, thanks</li>
    <li> Awesome scent. Favorite perfume my wife wears.</li>
    <li> Se recuerda de hace algunos años atrás bueno como hace 10 que la uso y no podía creer que la había conseguido.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite perfume I get more compliments on it. So happy I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love it beause my wife love&#x27;s it. I bought it for her as a gift because she used to wear it all the time and then couldn&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
    <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered Sun Moon and Star.  Cannot find this fragrance anywhere and I am so thankful I can order on line and it arrives quickly.</li>
    <li> Birthday Present for the wife - she loves it and so do i on her!</li>
    <li> a favorite since it first came out sooo many complements!</li>
    <li> I always wanted this fragrance and the price was great. I get lots of good comments about the smell. This is the right fragrance for my chemical makeup. Most smell bad on me for some reason so I am real pleased with this. I will order it again. I highly recommend it.</li>
