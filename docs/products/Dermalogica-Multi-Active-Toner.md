      <li>Dermalogica, besides being more expensive than others, I like this toner with its mild finishing to the skin.</li>
      <li>This really works and makes a big difference</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dermalogica products for 10 years, and the Multi-active toner prevents breakouts and keeps my skin clear - plus it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>

If you ever have the frustration of flaky skin ruining your make up this will help those as well! You can also use this product through out the day if you want to freshen your make up back up and also revamp your skin.</li>
