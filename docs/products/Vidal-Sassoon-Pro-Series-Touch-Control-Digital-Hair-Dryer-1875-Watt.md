### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The cord is a good length and you can use the directed air flow thingy</li>
      <li>A good idea for bathrooms - that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re the kind of person who varies the heat and intensity of the dryer in use - this will be very handy.</li>
      <li>When it works it is great, but what good does that do you if you can&#x27;t be sure it will ever</li>
      <li>it is great, but what good does that do you if you can&#x27;t be sure it will ever work?</li>
      <li>The power is good, the weight and cord length are fine and the dryer has a good ergonomic feel.</li>
      <li>nice thing about this one is the touch control on the handle.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The plug has its own built-in version of a GFI for safety, but includes a warning that you should have a GFI installed in your wall already for safety.</li>
      <li>the nice concentrator attachment doesn&#x27;t pop off when you look at it like some do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It took my &#x27;tween daughter&#x27;s assistance to figure out how to use this hair dryer, but once I got the hang of it, I really liked it.</li>
      <li>As a hair dryer, this VS Pro Series is pretty great.  </li>
      <li>This hair dryer is also heavier than most that we&#x27;ve had over the years.  </li>
      <li>Okay, disengage the \\&quot;settings\\&quot; lock, THEN turn it off...</li>
      <li>I have gone most of my life without using a hair dryer because my hair is bird nesting material...</li>
      <li>Mostly, I LOVE how lightweight the dryer is as compared to my Corioliss I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>More often than not I have just resorted to unplugging the dang thing to turn it off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love technology.</li>
      <li>It makes the air flow that much more concentrated and directed.  </li>
      <li>I never know if I might, just might be able to change the heat and airflow settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>She was very impressed and was excited to replace our old dryer with this one.</li>
      <li>BUT, it is easy to inadvertently set that control and not be able to get out of it without a &#x60;struggle&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is lightweight, handles nicely, and easy to clean.</li>
      <li>great, execution was completely lacking.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Do you need to be able to adjust the temperature and fan speed in precise 5-10% increments?</li>
      <li>To turn it on or off, you have to HOLD the power button for about 4 seconds, and since the button is recessed you need to kind of wiggle your fingertip just to get it in the right spot.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold</li>
      <li>This worked fine for me.  </li>
      <li>For me, this is a fine hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>For a non professional dryer, I get very good results from this one as its powerful, dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth, not frizzy.</li>
      <li>Is it touch activated or light activated?  </li>
      <li>the dryer feels sturdy and is comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>And is a touch control really the best technology to use for a device that you need to wrap your hand around during use, especially when that control is positioned under you hand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I originally gave it 3 stars, but since it had to be replaced so soon, I am changing my rating to 2 stars.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I did anything special; for me, it just worked.  </li>
      <li>I would love to give this a glowing review -- it looks nice, it has a long cord</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer.  </li>
      <li>and I would&#x27;ve given it a full five stars,</li>
      <li>The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Touch Control hair dryer works quickly and leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>keeps this dryer from being awesome, however, are the ridiculous touch controls.  </li>
      <li>She considers this to be an upgrade over the older one and is pleased with the unit&#x27;s performance since she started using it.</li>
      <li>, I have to think that Low-Medium-High adjustment for temp and fan speed, and a mechanical slide switch are probably adequate and anything beyond that is just technology for technology&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off</li>
      <li>The 1875 watts of power provides a strong output that drys the hair quickly and thanks to its tourmaline and ceramic technology</li>
      <li>They didn&#x27;t make it any easier to use, but quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro Series Touch Control Digital hair dryer is really nice</li>
      <li>If you have a gadget and it has cool tech in it, I am really interested.</li>
      <li>My less-than perfect rating is for the frustrating touch controls.</li>
      <li>Lightweight but powerful, with adjustable controls</li>
      <li>And this has a really good weight to it, not too heavy, not too light.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not holding my mouth right, but I decided to just yank it out of the wall to turn it</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>This does have unique controls and it took me a few minutes and the help of my 13 year old (lol) to figure them out.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line - my hair has a bit more body than it would when just air dried - and I was able to dry it in a few minutes with this awesome dryer - all without getting the frizzies...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the first hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned with a learning curve.</li>
      <li>The controls would afford excellent variability in either heat or speed beyond that of your generic hi/lo switches, but the ability to adjust the dryer is impaired by the alien starship controls.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t love the non traditional touch controls but they aren&#x27;t that tricky if you give them a chance.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like I was shutting off an electrical appliance, but more like I was choking out my opponent in an ultimate fighting match.</li>
      <li>However, the digital controls aren&#x27;t always the most responsive.  </li>
      <li>Beautifully styled in a fire-engine red with black accents</li>
      <li>It does what a hair dryer should do, and the digital controls are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It was trying to be too clever on the switches for on-off, high-low, hot-cold..but using the &#x27;touch&#x27; mode, which felt more like drag-and-hold...and not easy or precise.  </li>
      <li>Maybe touch controls aren&#x27;t necessary, but they did work fine for me.</li>
      <li>but about a month ago, I got a straight perm and have been on the hunt for a hair dryer</li>
      <li>not so much one this one item.</li>
      <li>that compromises on/off that much more.&lt;br /&gt;Double checking the GFI ...</li>
      <li>By pushing the red/yellow buttons with much force, the dryer will turn on.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Until Vidal Sassoon works out the kinks with the dryer, I really can&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
      <li>Probably a reasonable hair dryer if you can move beyond the controls.  </li>
      <li>Overall, the dryer is a joy to use, and the digital technology is terrific.  </li>
      <li>the soapbox, the functionality seems to work for my wife, though putting the touch control on the handle has been an issue for her as remembering to lock the touch panel during use tends to be forgotten or be an issue if she wants to change the settings.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice feel in the hand - not too heavy at all.</li>
      <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, there are ways to work around these problems, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to do more than push a button to turn a dryer off.  </li>
      <li>Originally, she thought the dryer was not working because it would not turn one, then realized that it took about five seconds for it to engage, and the same amount of time to turn off.....</li>
      <li>The only control that really bugs me, so I took a star off, is the cool air blast control.</li>
      <li>I am not sure this was quite worth the price, I ordinarily love the VS brand,</li>
      <li>This is a full sized 1875 Watt hair dryer, in red, that comes with a styling attachment.</li>
      <li>Once you read the instructions, it works fine enough, but the buttons aren&#x27;t as sensitive as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>, it has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; dry feature, which is important to me, and</li>
      <li>The longer I have used it, the more erratic and unpredictable it has</li>
      <li>so I give it two stars for decent performance.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are lots of easier-to-use hairdryers out there, particularly at the $45 price point.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest something similar but with more traditional controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In fact, it feels like a runaway machine, stuck on high and screaming in your ear while you jab, jab and stab fruitlessly at the OFF button.  </li>
      <li>Not wishing to permanently set a temp as I begin drying at high volume and heat and prefer to adjust when I feel I wish to set the style, I did not use the control to set the heat and flow...</li>
      <li>If there&#x27;s an identical version with normal switches and buttons, I&#x27;d recommend that instead.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Second problem: the buttons only rarely work.</li>
      <li>Works fine, but other, easier options</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had a new hair dryer in years</li>
      <li>In this day and age we really take for granted the function of a product to turn on/off with the simple press of a button - to not do so really boggles the mind when you come across a product like this out in the wild.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to create quite the same amount of \\&quot;wind\\&quot; as our previous 1875 dryer, but its warm enough.</li>
      <li>Finally, I jammed one finger over the OFF, pressed on that finger with another to prevent any photon of light from entering and the thing finally shuts off.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;First problem: the indention for the control is very deep and very slim.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a darn shame, really, because if we examine this product for it&#x27;s capability as a hair-dryer it actually deserves to be a 4-star product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First of all, I actually prefer controls that I can feel because then I don&#x27;t have to look at the handle of the dryer each time I need to change a setting, but putting that aside, because that is just personal preference, the touch controls might be a really neat addition to a tool that hasn&#x27;t changed much in years.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Where the product completely jumps the rails is its decision to utilize &#x27;touch&#x27; controls to turn the dryer on/off, adjust fan speed and heat levels.</li>
      <li>does a blow dryer really need to be digital?</li>
      <li>Even if I can get my finger in there, I am not guaranteed to get action.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like the Vidal Sassoon \\&quot;Pro Series Touch Control Digital Hair</li>
      <li>and I was hoping this would be quieter but for some reason, manufacturers are still making these things so loud</li>
      <li>cool down flow&lt;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too high and not within normal reach even for someone with long fingers.</li>
      <li>I think this is one of the only single star reviews I have done - generally I can find something redeeming or worthy of at least two stars.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the temperature adjustment with the speed also, but find it difficult to shut off.  Some time it does and some time not.</li>
    <li> Updating this review as I have continued to try to manage the operation of this hairdryer.  The longer I have used it, the more erratic and unpredictable it has become.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never know if it will go on, or off, and how to get it to go on or off.  I never know if I might, just might be able to change the heat and airflow settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it continues to rate in my opinion, one star. I will no longer try to use this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a waste as this dryer could be outstanding, especially when it initially appeared to have so much going for it:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;Pretty red&lt;br /&gt;Good airflow&lt;br /&gt;Good cool down flow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, now here is the big but:&lt;br /&gt;The digital controls are near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First if you have any hair product on your hands, wash and dry well, before attempting to move the controls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On/Off controls:&lt;br /&gt;This area is small.&lt;br /&gt;My fingertips are slim but still it was difficult to make the control work.&lt;br /&gt;If you have any length of fingernail tip...that compromises on/off that much more.&lt;br /&gt;Double checking the GFI ... this was never the cause of difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting heat and flow:&lt;br /&gt;One is to slide the fingers up or down to desired flow and temp, and if desired, set that temp.  Not wishing to permanently set a temp as I begin drying at high volume and heat and prefer to adjust when I feel I wish to set the style, I did not use the control to set the heat and flow...BUT, it is easy to inadvertently set that control and not be able to get out of it without a &#x60;struggle&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning the dryer off:&lt;br /&gt;Another issue...holding the control area down was frustrating in its response and it seems you had to get out of the &#x60;setting heat and flow&#x27; control before shutting down.... confusing to write in this review but that is the way it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool down button:&lt;br /&gt;Often have to look to the other side of the hair dryer to be certain where the flat digital control was topush.</li>
    <li> Probably a reasonable hair dryer if you can move beyond the controls.  Not having long nails, my ability to penetrate the recesses of the controls is not compromised.  Is it touch activated or light activated?  Who cares, neither works well.  The controls would afford excellent variability in either heat or speed beyond that of your generic hi/lo switches, but the ability to adjust the dryer is impaired by the alien starship controls.  In fact, it feels like a runaway machine, stuck on high and screaming in your ear while you jab, jab and stab fruitlessly at the OFF button.  Finally, I jammed one finger over the OFF, pressed on that finger with another to prevent any photon of light from entering and the thing finally shuts off.  It didn&#x27;t feel like I was shutting off an electrical appliance, but more like I was choking out my opponent in an ultimate fighting match.</li>
    <li> As a hair dryer, this VS Pro Series is pretty great.  Lightweight but powerful, with adjustable controls, this thing makes drying my long, thick hair less difficult than with other dryers.  The cord is a good length and you can use the directed air flow thingy (that may not be the technical term for that part) or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What keeps this dryer from being awesome, however, are the ridiculous touch controls.  Who thought of that?!  It took me a few tries to figure out how to turn this thing on -- you have to hold your finger over the power button for a few seconds to turn the hair dryer on and off, which doesn&#x27;t sound so bad but is especially irritating when you want to turn the thing off.  The adjustable heat and air flow levels also work by touch and are just as awkward.  Changing the settings is an inconvenient process.  The execution of the touch control idea is so bad that I can only give this dryer three stars.  I&#x27;d suggest something similar but with more traditional controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:  After only a few months of use, this hair dryer stopped working completely. I originally gave it 3 stars, but since it had to be replaced so soon, I am changing my rating to 2 stars.</li>
    <li> This is a full sized 1875 Watt hair dryer, in red, that comes with a styling attachment. What can I say, it does the job and dries hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nice thing about this one is the touch control on the handle. If you&#x27;re the kind of person who varies the heat and intensity of the dryer in use - this will be very handy. Otherwise, this might seem excessive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice feel in the hand - not too heavy at all.</li>
    <li> I would love to give this a glowing review -- it looks nice, it has a long cord so I can use it in the dressing area where the plug is close to the floor, but my head isn&#x27;t, it has a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; dry feature, which is important to me, and the nice concentrator attachment doesn&#x27;t pop off when you look at it like some do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter what outlet I go to, the thing just won&#x27;t turn on. Ah well.</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t believe that one should have to read instructions to figure out how to use a blow dryer. And, I&#x27;m having a little trouble with the lock feature... it won&#x27;t unlock so that I can adjust the air flow. I like the color, though...</li>
    <li> Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series &#x27;Touch Control Digital&#x27; Hair Dryer is a classic example of an over-engineered product that sacrifices basic functionality for unnecessary bells and whistles making the whole user experience a lesson in frustration from start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s a darn shame, really, because if we examine this product for it&#x27;s capability as a hair-dryer it actually deserves to be a 4-star product. Beautifully styled in a fire-engine red with black accents the dryer feels sturdy and is comfortable in the hand. The 1875 watts of power provides a strong output that drys the hair quickly and thanks to its tourmaline and ceramic technology the far-infrared heat really does provide a soft finish to your hair and never leaves you with that nasty dried-out look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where the product completely jumps the rails is its decision to utilize &#x27;touch&#x27; controls to turn the dryer on/off, adjust fan speed and heat levels. In theory, this should have been a &#x27;neat&#x27; feature giving the dryer some tech-cred with its digital controls and indicators - however - the &#x27;touch&#x27; portion of these controls are haphazardly incorporated and mostly unresponsive.  Simply trying to turn the product on takes 5-10 seconds on average, usually requiring 3 different presses of the button before it registers. Sliding the fan/heat levels is just as bad and for some reason I have not been able to turn the dryer off by pressing/holding the button down (I have to unplug the dryer to shut it off). In this day and age we really take for granted the function of a product to turn on/off with the simple press of a button - to not do so really boggles the mind when you come across a product like this out in the wild.</li>
    <li> For a non professional dryer, I get very good results from this one as its powerful, dries my hair quickly and leaves it smooth, not frizzy. Mostly, I LOVE how lightweight the dryer is as compared to my Corioliss I&#x27;ve been using. This does have unique controls and it took me a few minutes and the help of my 13 year old (lol) to figure them out. To turn it off and on, I hold it down 5 seconds and it consistently works. I don&#x27;t love the non traditional touch controls but they aren&#x27;t that tricky if you give them a chance. The only control that really bugs me, so I took a star off, is the cool air blast control. It&#x27;s too high and not within normal reach even for someone with long fingers. It needs to be moved down. I think the dryer does perform well, but I&#x27;m happier with my (more expensive) Corioliss even though its a bit heavy. I recommend the dryer, but only to gadget type people who don&#x27;t mind taking the time to explore the controls.</li>
    <li> I have gone most of my life without using a hair dryer because my hair is bird nesting material... but about a month ago, I got a straight perm and have been on the hunt for a hair dryer so I no longer would go to work with wet hair. Even with my perm, a regular hair dryer (without the Tourmaline ionic ceramic stuff) will still frazzle my hair a bit. This one doesn&#x27;t. Easy to hold and once it&#x27;s on and blowing, a pleasure to use. My less-than perfect rating is for the frustrating touch controls. I see the advantage of them - less of an opportunity for any wetness from hands to get into controls - but the LCD under the buttons is hard to see... you have to hold at an angle to see the power symbol image - and I can hit that thing 20 times, hold it, stand on one leg or possibly howl at the moon before it comes on. I understand the appeal of everything being touch controls these days - but I could have done with a simpler approach. It&#x27;s a hair dryer - I&#x27;m not going to be facebooking with it. I don&#x27;t need it to work like a smart phone or have it tweet that I just blow dried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several uses, I finally got the knack of turning it on - but then it&#x27;s tricky to turn it off - which makes zero sense! It&#x27;s the same button. Maybe I&#x27;m just not holding my mouth right, but I decided to just yank it out of the wall to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plug has its own built-in version of a GFI for safety, but includes a warning that you should have a GFI installed in your wall already for safety. A good idea for bathrooms - that&#x27;s for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - my hair has a bit more body than it would when just air dried - and I was able to dry it in a few minutes with this awesome dryer - all without getting the frizzies... but the controls (especially to turn the thing on and off!) are very frustrating to use.</li>
    <li> Oh dear. I think this is one of the only single star reviews I have done - generally I can find something redeeming or worthy of at least two stars. I like the color! And this has a really good weight to it, not too heavy, not too light. But those things aren&#x27;t enough to offset the disaster that is the touch controls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I actually prefer controls that I can feel because then I don&#x27;t have to look at the handle of the dryer each time I need to change a setting, but putting that aside, because that is just personal preference, the touch controls might be a really neat addition to a tool that hasn&#x27;t changed much in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the controls just don&#x27;t work. I had to plug in the dryer, fiddle with the plug, unplug it, try a new outlet, until finally the electronic controls lit up so that I could use them. Now I could get down to putting this thing through its paces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First problem: the indention for the control is very deep and very slim. I have long nails and I had to do a bit of finger contortion in order to get a firm press on the button. If you have anything but very slender nails with stubby fingernails, these buttons are going to be difficult. Which led me to the second problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second problem: the buttons only rarely work. Even if I can get my finger in there, I am not guaranteed to get action. Sometimes if I hold down the power button - continuously - for a few seconds it will turn on. But not always. And sometimes if I slide the temperature or the wind speed up or down it works, but not always. And I can&#x27;t get the lock setting to work ever. Then when it is time to turn the dryer off, sometimes it works if I hold the power button down (again, after much finger contortion) for a few seconds, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. More often than not I have just resorted to unplugging the dang thing to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until Vidal Sassoon works out the kinks with the dryer, I really can&#x27;t recommend it at all. When it works it is great, but what good does that do you if you can&#x27;t be sure it will ever work?orks it is great, but what good does that do you if you can&#x27;t be sure it will ever work?</li>
    <li> The Touch Screen is not sensitive enough.  By pushing the red/yellow buttons with much force, the dryer will turn on.  But to turn the dryer off, the touch screen does not react when the button is pushed so the dryer must be unplugged to turn off.  As other reviewers have mentioned, there are ways to work around these problems, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to do more than push a button to turn a dryer off.  The power is good, the weight and cord length are fine and the dryer has a good ergonomic feel.</li>
    <li> My wife is using the Vidal Sassoon hair dryer, as my hair is very short!  She loves the feature of the &amp;#34;digital touch&amp;#34; slide bar for the heat &amp; speed because it is RECESSED on the handle.  Her previous dryer had buttons that stuck out on the handle, and she was constantly turning them off while drying her hair.  What a pain!  Her only complaint is the &amp;#34;digital touch&amp;#34; recessed On-Off button. (Reason for 4 stars.) Originally, she thought the dryer was not working because it would not turn one, then realized that it took about five seconds for it to engage, and the same amount of time to turn off.....the paperwork says &amp;#34;for a couple of seconds&amp;#34;.  Overall, the dryer is a joy to use, and the digital technology is terrific.  It is lightweight, handles nicely, and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Yikes.  What didn&#x27;t I like about it:&lt;br /&gt;It was trying to be too clever on the switches for on-off, high-low, hot-cold..but using the &#x27;touch&#x27; mode, which felt more like drag-and-hold...and not easy or precise.  For appearances and the idea- great, execution was completely lacking.&lt;br /&gt;The blow was okay, and not great.  I am not sure this was quite worth the price, I ordinarily love the VS brand, not so much one this one item.</li>
    <li> The ladies in our home all like this hair dryer.  It does what a hair dryer should do, and the digital controls are easy to use.  However, the digital controls aren&#x27;t always the most responsive.  That is the only complaint I&#x27;ve heard.  This hair dryer is also heavier than most that we&#x27;ve had over the years.  It&#x27;s not as though it weighs a ton, but it is a bit heavier.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good hair dryer.  The digital controls seem a little excessive, but they do give you fairly precise control over the heat, etc.</li>
    <li> It took my &#x27;tween daughter&#x27;s assistance to figure out how to use this hair dryer, but once I got the hang of it, I really liked it. It dried my hair quickly without feeling like it was frying the strands.</li>
    <li> Playing devil&#x27;s advocate, you have to wonder, does a blow dryer really need to be digital? Do you need to be able to adjust the temperature and fan speed in precise 5-10% increments? And is a touch control really the best technology to use for a device that you need to wrap your hand around during use, especially when that control is positioned under you hand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would answer no to all no to all of those questions, I have to think that Low-Medium-High adjustment for temp and fan speed, and a mechanical slide switch are probably adequate and anything beyond that is just technology for technology&#x27;s sake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the soapbox, the functionality seems to work for my wife, though putting the touch control on the handle has been an issue for her as remembering to lock the touch panel during use tends to be forgotten or be an issue if she wants to change the settings. All in all, my recommendation is a pass and stick with the standard controls when you buy a blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;P-)</li>
    <li> The Vidal Sassoon Pro Series Touch Control hair dryer works quickly and leaves hair nice and soft. My wife&#x27;s input was that normally she needs to dry her hair in sections, but the VS Pro dried everything in one go. She was very impressed and was excited to replace our old dryer with this one. I fussed around with it myself and felt that the touch controls were completely unnecessary. They didn&#x27;t make it any easier to use, but quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro Series Touch Control Digital hair dryer is really nice and I would&#x27;ve given it a full five stars, but I&#x27;m just not sold on the touch controls. If there&#x27;s an identical version with normal switches and buttons, I&#x27;d recommend that instead.</li>
    <li> This worked fine for me.  I plugged it in, turned it on, fiddled with the heat control, blew dry my hair, and turned it off with the button, all with no trouble. I don&#x27;t think I did anything special; for me, it just worked.  As a hair dryer it worked pretty much as expected, although I did like the attachment for concentrating the air.  It makes the air flow that much more concentrated and directed.  For me, this is a fine hair dryer.  Maybe touch controls aren&#x27;t necessary, but they did work fine for me.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the Vidal Sassoon \\&quot;Pro Series Touch Control Digital Hair Dryer\\&quot;. After all, it&#x27;s a corvette red hair dryer with TOUCH controls that glow with blue LED lights! How could this thing fail?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about \\&quot;miserably\\&quot;. I mean, it&#x27;s a hair dryer, right? So all you have to do is turn it on... I said, turn it on... turn ON!... TURN ON YOU STUPID HAIR DRYER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, moving on... Once you get it turned on, you just slide your finger over the controls to adjust the temperature and speed and... wait, why did it get cold... (oops, don&#x27;t touch the controls while you&#x27;re holding it!). There&#x27;s a little \\&quot;Lock\\&quot; button you can touch to lock in your settings and keep them from changing but wait... where did it go? The icon disappeared (permanently)! So it&#x27;s this button...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, now that we have it turned on, it works well. It doesn&#x27;t seem to create quite the same amount of \\&quot;wind\\&quot; as our previous 1875 dryer, but its warm enough. Now that we&#x27;re finished, all you have to do is turn it off... wait.. the button to lock in the settings won&#x27;t allow it to turn off? Okay, disengage the \\&quot;settings\\&quot; lock, THEN turn it off... I said, turn OFF... TURN OFF... TURN OFF YOU STUPID &amp;%^$ HAIR DRYER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh... I&#x27;ll just use the yellow safety trip buttons on the wall-wart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But seriously, this pretty much defines the experience. This dryer was simply NOT ready for prime time. The concept is great, but the execution is horrible. Maybe I just got a bad dryer. But if not, someone in quality control needs to lose their job. And you, oh seeker of super-cool hair dryers... keep looking. There&#x27;s nothing you want to see (or touch) here.</li>
    <li> This replaced an older model of hair dryer that my wife has had for several years. She considers this to be an upgrade over the older one and is pleased with the unit&#x27;s performance since she started using it.</li>
    <li> Short attention span review: This hairdryer is unnecessarily complicated. Works fine, but other, easier options available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full review: I love technology. If you have a gadget and it has cool tech in it, I am really interested. Unfortunately for this hairdryer, the technology built in just makes it more complicated to use. You can&#x27;t simply turn it on out of the box. It&#x27;s the first hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever owned with a learning curve. Once you read the instructions, it works fine enough, but the buttons aren&#x27;t as sensitive as they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of easier-to-use hairdryers out there, particularly at the $45 price point. I would go with one of those.</li>
    <li> This is a product with a major design flaw: the controls are not what you expect. To turn it on or off, you have to HOLD the power button for about 4 seconds, and since the button is recessed you need to kind of wiggle your fingertip just to get it in the right spot. I had trouble getting it to turn on, and the second time I used it I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn off at all so I yanked the cord out of the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does dry hair efficiently so I give it two stars for decent performance. I haven&#x27;t had a new hair dryer in years and I was hoping this would be quieter but for some reason, manufacturers are still making these things so loud you can&#x27;t hear a telephone or even a smoke alarm while you&#x27;re drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning to put this in our guest bathroom to replace the one that my husband used for drying paint (and got paint on). Unfortunately, guests would be befuddled by the controls on this so it won&#x27;t suit that purpose.</li>
