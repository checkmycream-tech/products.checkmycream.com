      <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it</li>
      <li>Will be buying more soon..</li>
      <li>Love this oil-</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>The oil is OK.  </li>
      <li>My hair has grown more than an inch in eight weeks.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair softer and moisturized it for many days.</li>
      <li>Ok i used this product for a week and already see a change in my hair.</li>
      <li>Great and fast shipping</li>
      <li>but i wanted to make them more healthier looking.</li>
      <li>Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>and I wanted more length</li>
      <li>Love love itttt</li>
      <li>I truly love this product.in fact</li>
      <li>When I opened this oil it should have a strong smell most people complain about I noticed</li>
      <li>in all, I don&#x27;t think this oil is helping with growth at all, but it is definitely helping with my incredibly frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>The smeel isn&#x27;t nice at all but its worth it.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell as good as people claim.</li>
      <li>its easy to use.</li>
      <li>Strong smell, but not offensive.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It does have strong smell to it</li>
      <li>good price works good but be careful</li>
      <li>The smell is fine if you are not used to just using perfumed hair products.</li>
      <li>seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on</li>
      <li>and so far so good</li>
      <li>I want to be totally honest about this oil actually helping my hair grow, so I know this is probably going to be long, but I want to try to help anyone to the best of  my ability.</li>
      <li>a full 30 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>it took 7 days for me to receive just one bottle I had to email them because the phone number listed on the invoice and on their site sends you to a full voicemail upon emailing them I recvd the rest of my order</li>
      <li>This wild hair growth keeps my hair growing strong, healthy, and prevents breakages.</li>
      <li>friends daughter has grown tremendously using this product.</li>
      <li>if you want better quality light hair oil buy the wild growth hair oil from their website www.wildgrowth.com .</li>
      <li>This is a product at least worth trying because my hair is the best it has ever been in years!!</li>
      <li>seeing the great results on my own hair.filling in bald patches nicely strengthens the hair there now and have new hair sprouting everywhere from hairline ,part and even eyebrows.this stuff is nothing if not amazing and the price is completely affordable for any budget.</li>
      <li>like most commercialized hair products do anymore, but it does smell clean and natural.  </li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t freak out about the smell, it will be worth your while.</li>
      <li>, it will be worth your while.</li>
      <li>The product does require regular use in order to see results but you will be happy you tried it and will NOT need any other product to keep your hair healthy and growing, this stuff is basically stopping your hair from sheeding and breaking which keepsit growing naturally and healthy.</li>
      <li>It really works stinky, but worth it , yea !</li>
      <li>When I wash my hair the smell comes right out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good hair oil, moisturizes my scalp and tames frizzies, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth differing from my normal growth since starting use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very very oily,  I used 3 times a week.  </li>
      <li>I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS OIL IN TEXAS.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I hope this was helpful, and I hope you buy this product, because if anything I know for sure it will most definitely give life back to your hair!</li>
      <li>One I started using this product I saw results fast!  </li>
      <li>Smells kinda funny though</li>
      <li>Saw improvement within the first 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>Another thing is that you have to be consistent with how you use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Strong smell, but not offensive.&lt;br /&gt;The smell eventually goes away.&lt;br /&gt;I use to treat my hair overnight.&lt;br /&gt;My friends daughter has grown tremendously using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a good product for hair length growth but did not work for hair loss.</li>
    <li> Hair has grown a little from this, I believe. Not too much, though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very very oily,  I used 3 times a week.  And we&#x27;ll I saw no difference after 6 weeks I have a little remaining I&#x27;ll continue to use it.. But my hair didn&#x27;t grow any more than it grows with out the oil.  Edges are the same,  hair grows at the same rate.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad after a while you. Get accustomed to the smell.  The oil is OK.  The little I have remaining I&#x27;m going to use it on my edges only.  Oh the oil grow my finger nails . I will purchases this oil again.  Because I like it.  I&#x27;m going to purchase this double pack.  Comes out better than when I bought my single at my local beauty  supply store</li>
    <li> I chose this product after reading all of the amazing reviews.  I have had a problem with thinning hair over the last year and it has gotten progressively worse.  I noticed an immediate difference in the amount of hair shedding now after I wash it and I attribute this from using this product!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if this really grows hair but it has a pretty pungent smell to it that I just can&#x27;t get pass.</li>
    <li> I have African American hair, and have been using this oil off and on for a few years now, and I must say, I have been pleased with the results every time! It usually costs between $7 - $10 in the stores, which is why I don&#x27;t use it constantly. But I am making a commitment to stick to using this as it has proven to be the best hair oil for me!</li>
    <li> good price works good but be careful a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> I have not seen any results but will continue to use it and see what happens. its easy to use.</li>
    <li> It made my hair softer and moisturized it for many days. it spells good and my hair feels thicker and has been growing healthily. I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and it is just great. i would recommend it to anyone with thin, dry hair that needs some life and body</li>
    <li> Helped my edges grow after most of tit fell out after giving birth . The smell is herbal and some have complained about it but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> I personally haven&#x27;t seen a difference</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!! Will be buying more soon..</li>
    <li> The product is great. Really makes my hair grow faster and seems fuller. I have recently moved country and my hair suffered since the water is so different where I am now. Wild Growth Hair Oil put the fullness back in my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this on my natural hair.The smeel isn&#x27;t nice at all but its worth it. Another thing is that you have to be consistent with how you use it. It is oily and a bit greasy. I usually put it in my hair twice a week. If you put too much in your hair it will run down your head (just a caution). Gives my hair a nice shine. This oil works, you just have to find a way to use it to give you the results that you want. In my case i sectioned my hair into four parts. Within each part i applyied it all over my scalp and hair (2x week). Find out what way works best for you when using this product and stick with it. You have to be consistent to get results (in my opinion)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wild Growth for years. It&#x27;s an excellent product and it works. It does grow the hair. Highly recommended for people with thinning hair or bald spots, relaxed or natural, all hair types.  Or if you simply want longer thicker hair this is the product for you.  I use Wild Growth after washing my hair. I simply apply to scalp and then blow dry on low or medium heat, for a hot oil affect.  It&#x27;s great! I love it! And this 2 for deal was great!</li>
    <li> I used this product for the last 2 months, my hair has definitely grew from this product. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;This oil works like a charm. I use it to repair my hair and it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
    <li> Sorry but this product just isn&#x27;t for me. Took&lt;br /&gt;almost a week to get RID of this substance&lt;br /&gt;out of my hair &amp; scalp.</li>
    <li> I have been using product for about 6 months.  It&#x27;s a good hair oil, moisturizes my scalp and tames frizzies, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth differing from my normal growth since starting use.  I was concerned, after reading reviews, that the smell was going to be completely unbearable, however it&#x27;s quite the opposite. I won&#x27;t say it smells &amp;#34;fruity and delicious&amp;#34; like most commercialized hair products do anymore, but it does smell clean and natural.  If you&#x27;re used to hair oils that evaporate after a while, this is definitely not a product like that.  When used heavily as a scalp treatment, the oil stays on your hair until you shampoo it out.  When doing a scalp treatment I apply a couple palm fulls of the oil to my hair and scalp before bed, and wrap my head in a scarf so it doesn&#x27;t rub off on my sheets.  I also use the oil daily sparingly before blowdrying my hair to tame frizzies and help protect it from heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a second bottle and mixed a few droplets of cinnamon oil in with it as a scalp treatment, and absolutely love it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t think this oil is helping with growth at all, but it is definitely helping with my incredibly frizzy hair. It&#x27;s also a great heat protector. I like this oil and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> It took out the hair on my edges. smells kind of bad but tolerable  and check out this site if you want to earn free Amazon giftcards :) [...]</li>
    <li> This is my second order of Wild Growth Oil. I love it! Before ordering I read the reviews and after reading I ordered. I&#x27;m African American and I have natural hair and I wanted more length so I searched for products that can help out with that. Let&#x27;s just say Wild Growth Oil is that product! I must keep a bottle in my cabinet.</li>
    <li> I Purchased the wild hair growth oil two pack from this company it took 7 days for me to receive just one bottle I had to email them because the phone number listed on the invoice and on their site sends you to a full voicemail upon emailing them I recvd the rest of my order 4 days later it took a total of 13 days for me to recv my completed order two days for them to respond by email . When I opened this oil it should have a strong smell most people complain about I noticed this had no smell and it seemed thicker than the oil I had before so I contacted the company and went to my Sallys both said due to the product being natural no perfumes are added that&#x27;s what cause the strong smell Sallys agreed this had no smell at all and actually opened a bottle of theres to compare this oil was thicker and darker with no smell at all. So I asked for a refund and a return slip What America Buys told me in an email take it up with wildhairgrowth oil that&#x27;s where they got it from. Amazon bless their hearts fixed the problem for me but I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THIS IS NOT A COMPANY THIS IS A PERSON THAT IS DOING THAT AT HOME WORK THING WHERE YOU SET UP A SITE AND THE CUSTOMER ORDER FROM THE ITS A WAREHOUSE SETUP FOR ONLINE WORK. That&#x27;s why the refund part is a problem for them and why there&#x27;s no direct number to reach anyone. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS COMPANY well this person</li>
    <li> I truly love this product.in fact I have my husband using it now after seeing the great results on my own hair.filling in bald patches nicely strengthens the hair there now and have new hair sprouting everywhere from hairline ,part and even eyebrows.this stuff is nothing if not amazing and the price is completely affordable for any budget.I have and will use this product and company again!!it truly works .</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me and it smelled horrible. I did use another product called Sea Breeze there are few colors out there, I&#x27;ve used the blue one and I feel like it&#x27;s working..... It does have strong smell to it so I used it at night..</li>
    <li> I will never run out of this product.  My hair has grown more than an inch in eight weeks.  When I went to the salon to get my eights relaxer touch up, my hair stylist was amazed at how my hair has grown.  This is a great product for my hair challenge in which is past mid back length by December.  It is almost at that length now.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell as good as people claim. All you have to do is use a little bit to feel results.</li>
    <li> The small is really not that bad, it has a natural ganger smell but its not that bad. I think it&#x27;s working. My hair has been boring faster then it usually does which is great</li>
    <li> Ok i used this product for a week and already see a change in my hair. Alot fuller and thickness, which is great for me because my hair is thin and soft, im natural, meaning i dont use perms, i use this on my kids hair as well, the smell is not that bad, i dont know why people are complaining about it, this will grow your hair! :-)</li>
    <li> My fav product everrrrrrr. My hair grows a lot while using this. The smell is not that great but guess wht! it gets the job done. Love love itttt</li>
    <li> seems to work fine. I have used this in the past with no problems and believe that it contributed to hair growth although how much I do not know because I wear protective hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Its a little smell , so I suggest putting it on at night, works for ALL hair. Grows about an inch per month.</li>
    <li> The oil comes in a 4 oz. bottle with an applicator tip. I applied the product three times each week,  massaged my scalp for 2 minutes, and then prepped my hair for bed/the next day. After 2 weeks, I did an unofficial hair check to see how the product was working, and it didn’t appear that my hair had grown at all! But, to be fair, I decided to continue to use the product until the end of the month so I could see how well the oil worked within a month’s time (a full 30 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, 1/3 of my hair grew 1.5&amp;#34;! No, that IS NOT a typo. The remaining 2/3 of my hair grew at it&#x27;s normal rate. So, I will be using this again to see how much growth I can get long-term. For only $8, this growth oil is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my complete review, go to: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/wild-growth-hair-oil/</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I heard a lot about it on youtube the smell is not the best but, it&#x27;s not that bad either, I going to give it a little while before I post a review of this product. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I loved the product.  Currently using it other essential oils to work on growing back damaged edges. I would order it again</li>
    <li> I love this product! I ordered this product and started using it on February 27, 2014. My hair grew 1/2 inch in 6 days! I love this product. I also incorporated the inversion method with this product and it works! I would recommend this product to anyone who on a healthy hair growth journey!</li>
    <li> I bout this product after reading all the great reviews because my hair line seems to be receding and nothing was working for me (believe me I tried everything).&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Wild Growth Hair Oil for about a month now and my hair is actually growing back, it looks fuller by my hair line.&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;m black with 4c like hair.</li>
    <li> Product is very good. Received product within three days. Awesome!!!</li>
    <li> I just started using it so I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness on hair growth (I will comne back and write one in several months).  But the smell is absolutely delightful, I love the application tip and it is very moisturizing.  Looking forward to seeing some positive results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this product and I think I my hair is still growing using it. Good product though. :)</li>
    <li> Product DOES NOT smell bad at all, a bit like a green tea and mint tea mixture, GREAT for your hair and it dos work. I recommend you purchase the double pack because once you begin usuing this product you WON&#x27;T want to run out.The product does require regular use in order to see results but you will be happy you tried it and will NOT need any other product to keep your hair healthy and growing, this stuff is basically stopping your hair from sheeding and breaking which keepsit growing naturally and healthy. I did trim my split ends before i started the 90day challenge ith using this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really get a chance to see if it made my hair grow because it makes your hair greasy. But it is an oil so I should have know that. My fault. But it makes your hair really shiny. Smells kinda funny though</li>
    <li> My hair does really great with this product. This wild hair growth keeps my hair growing strong, healthy, and prevents breakages.</li>
    <li> It really grows hair back due to stress, I just love my new baby fine hair. It really works stinky, but worth it , yea ! I am so happy ..</li>
    <li> I do not see any growth difference.  It did not perform as stated in the description.  I followed the instruction and have used 1 and 1/2 bottles.  I will not buy the product again.</li>
    <li> I think this product is excellent! It gave my hair a beautiful shine and I have dull bleached hair. After only two uses of this product my hair was shining like I had never dyed it. I want to be totally honest about this oil actually helping my hair grow, so I know this is probably going to be long, but I want to try to help anyone to the best of  my ability. I have been using this oil for 3 nights. I put it in my hair at night and sleep on it. The bottle recommends putting it in your hair between washes, but it made my hair look oily when I done that, so I just put it in at night and I believe it is still doing the job. Now, about the actual growth part, I think it is helping my hair grow, and it definitely is helping my hair get healthier and I think that&#x27;s key when trying to grow your hair out, is that you want long healthy hair, not long fried hair. Along with this product I have been doing the inversion method at night with this oil. The inversion method if you are not sure what it is, you can look it up on YouTube or Google, but basically all you do is flip your hair over and massage the scalp with oil of your choice for five minutes. I have also been taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins. I have taken these vitamins in the past and I know for a fact that they done wonders for my hair. I don&#x27;t know if you are trying to grow your hair longer or if your looking at this product for some other reason, but all of the above methods have given me a little more than half of an inch in growth in just 5 days. I think that&#x27;s pretty awesome, others may think it&#x27;s not that great, but everyone&#x27;s hair is different. Anyway, I hope this was helpful, and I hope you buy this product, because if anything I know for sure it will most definitely give life back to your hair! One other thing that I noticed on the other reviews on this product before I bought it, was about the smell. The smell does smell like a pine tree, but it&#x27;s not that bad. When I wash my hair the smell comes right out. So don&#x27;t freak out about the smell, it will be worth your while. I will be the first to say I don&#x27;t like my hair to smell weird and my hair, once I wash it, does not smell like a pine tree. However, in some cases, because everybody&#x27;s hair is different, some people&#x27;s hair may smell still after washing, but the good news is, it really doesn&#x27;t smell that bad. Well that&#x27;s all and as I said before I hope you do buy this product, because it is great!out. So don&#x27;t freak out about the smell, it will be worth your while.

    <li> This product is great.  I came across it while searching for hair products on Amazon.  I was skeptical due to all of the hair products I have tried many many products in the past that promised \\&quot;supergrowth,\\&quot; \\&quot;megagrowth,\\&quot; and \\&quot;ultragrowth,\\&quot; but failed to deliver the results that there names claim.  I even started using Carol&#x27;s Daughter and Dr. Miracles&#x27; products, but none have made my hair grow faster than this!  I have really curly, short bushy hair that due to my relaxing and flat ironing had gotten dry, brittle, and hardly grew at all.  One I started using this product I saw results fast!  I would recommend using it with the Wild Growth hair oil moisturizer as this helps aid in the process of repairing hair.  The product does have a slight odor of tea tree oil, but after 30 minutes or so the smells seems to go away for me.  This is a product at least worth trying because my hair is the best it has ever been in years!!</li>
    <li> Your hair will start growing but dont expect it to happen over night. I think in about 20/30 days you will see results but the point is YOU WILL SEE RESULT</li>
    <li> The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on (I could have dealt with that).  But after a day or two, your hair has a very foul odor.  Like you have not washed it in about 3 or 4 months (maybe longer).  The smell is very bad!!!  I can&#x27;t walk around like that! It did make my hair soft and manageable.  but that still was not enough to keep me using it.  I tried it when I first got it.  After the first two days the bad odor came, so I washed and clarified my hair.  Waited a week and try it again.  SAME THING HAPPEN!!! I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out my hair fast enough.  It&#x27;s not for me, I will not walk around stinking. :(</li>
    <li> doesnt work you just get gresses hair</li>
    <li> Wish i was more consistent to see whether or not my hair grew faster lol.. but it made my hair feel awesome</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about two months and so far so good, I&#x27;ve had some new growth it and keeps my hair from being dry and from shedding.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, working a miracle for my hair. I would highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;To those who want hair growth!!!! Awesome Product!</li>
    <li> Seems to really work after continual use.</li>
    <li> Very good product I&#x27;m enjoying it I see hair growth. I will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS OIL IN TEXAS.  MY SISTER BOUGHT ME TWO BOTTLES. JUST AFTER USING IT FOR TWO WEEKS I NOTICED MY HAIR GROWTH.  IT A GREAT BUY!!!!!</li>
    <li> i had normal hair but i wanted to make them more healthier looking. it made my hair fall out like crazy. my hair is so thin now though they do feel more softer but man i trimmed my hair and i think i have to get a short hair cut beacuse they look so bad so thin and long. it is extremely greasy if you put more than 15 drops the oil wont leave you. i dont think that the smell was horrible like people complain here</li>
    <li> YES YES YES!!!!!!! MY HAIR IS GROWING , I REALLY DAMAGED MY HAIR WITH THE WEAVES, THE SEW-INS, THE GLUE WELL PEEPS THIS PRODUCT WORK AFTER A MONTH MY HAIR HAS GROWN BACK ON THE SIDES AND IT&#x27;S GETTING FULLER OMG THIS IS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SKEPTICAL IN BUYING THIS LIKE I WAS BUT IT DOES WORK  A LITTLE GREASY BUT IT WORKS</li>
    <li> This product helps the dry ends but I have not seen any hair growth.</li>
    <li> I previously colored my hair making it a lot easier to see my new growth and my hair has grown an 1inch in 2 weeks however I am using this in combination with other products.</li>
    <li> This stuff have grown my hair to 5inches from 1 inch. I started using this product in Oct. 2014. My hair has grown an inch a month using this stuff. I have never tried the moisturizer, I have only used the growing hair oil. I have found out that the moisturizer is very light still oily but it good too. I have start using it after my hair washes, now. I still prefer just using the regular hair oil. These are some good products used together, I think. If you like oily hair like I do then this is the product for you. If you don&#x27;t then use it every other day or week. These products are very oily and can weigh the hair down. I usually braid my hair and wear a wig. I must say, I have to wash my pillow cases and my pillows a lot because of the oil stains. Other than that, these products do grow the hair and keep your hair oily or moisturized. I like it and will keep using this product and it lasts for a long time. Do not put other products on your hair or use this product too much at one time because you can have build up in your scalp. The build up looks white in the scalp and will be chalky like when trying to wash it out. Use a good shampoo and scrub your scalp well before washing to make sure the build up is out. Other than that, this product will grow your hair.</li>
    <li> Poor quality not the same as original one because I tried both  ..from amazon and from wildgrowth website ..stop selling this trash to ppl ....if you want better quality light hair oil buy the wild growth hair oil from their website www.wildgrowth.com . Not from amazon</li>
    <li> Saw improvement within the first 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> i like this as a massage oil. but it is thick and makes your hair dirty i stopped using it after these two bottles</li>
    <li> Well, it makes my hair really soft, I was really looking for a product that will grow my hair but i have not seen any growth results yet, I am another one left so i am going to use that up and see the result. The smell is fine if you are not used to just using perfumed hair products. I really hope it works because i want my hair long as possible&lt;br /&gt;right now i am neck length and i am still there.</li>
    <li> great oil leaves my hair smelling great and I am starting to regrow hair can not say enough, will be ordering again</li>
    <li> I just like oils. lol</li>
    <li> great oil got some good result</li>
    <li> Love this oil- I believe it definitely helps my 4b hair to grow. I heat a little and use it as a treatment right before I shampoo.  It&#x27;s light enough for me and I also use a few drops mixed in with what ever curly  pudding product I use on my hair.  I reorder one I start my second bottle.</li>
    <li> Came fast...as described.. Thanks</li>
    <li> helps with thicker hair growth, i use this three times a week as directed. has a smell but I&#x27;ve grown accustomed to it</li>
    <li> Great and fast shipping</li>
