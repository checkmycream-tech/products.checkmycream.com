      <li>This is the best curling iron I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Nevertheless, since I got it figured out, I&#x27;ve been very happy using this product.</li>
      <li>THE BEST CURLING IRON I HAVE EVER HAD.</li>
      <li>Work great and is just what I needed!</li>
      <li>This iron is the perfect size.</li>
      <li>This is one of the best curling irons i have ever had.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t make very good curls.</li>
      <li>It holds my hair perfectly and does a great job.  </li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>While the size of this curling iron is nice, it isn&#x27;t a great tool.  </li>
      <li>I am very pleased with this.</li>
      <li>i love it!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Very light and flimsy.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had that happen, it just feels very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>Fantastic!</li>
      <li>But given the chance, I&#x27;ll buy a better quality model.</li>
      <li>Will be returning this one for sure.</li>
      <li>Perfect curling iron for short hair.</li>
      <li>I have a short hair cut, so the width of the curling iron was perfect.</li>
      <li>#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;, but I have gotten better quality even at this price.</li>
      <li>The tighter the spring the better curl you will get.  </li>
      <li>okay?</li>
      <li>I have used mini stylers before and have had better luck</li>
      <li>so you always have to check it to make sure it still turned on ...</li>
      <li>I am extremely satisfied with this curling iron.  </li>
      <li>This maybe a good purchase for a tween if your concerned about them using a iron that gets too hot.</li>
      <li>I would have appreciated an  indicator light to let me know when it&#x27;s fully heated, but for the price, I&#x27;m still happy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many curling ifons, and they always work on my hair because its fine.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t look good with straight hair - must have curls.  </li>
      <li>The high setting is luke warm at best and the low setting almost non-existent.  </li>
      <li>Easy to burn ear or scalp.  </li>
      <li>so when I am using it, it slips out of my hands to easily.</li>
      <li>Not so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
      <li>A great curling iron for short hair.</li>
      <li>and it was so cheap and</li>
      <li>its perfect and love the size its perfect for my short hairs when i want a whimsical up doo</li>
      <li>My husband agrees (which proves my point!)</li>
      <li>Needed a curing iron for small curls and this one worked great!!</li>
      <li>Not disappointed.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t even get very hot and it turns off super easy</li>
      <li>True, this iron is inexpensive and one could say &amp;</li>
      <li>This is a good, basic curling iron.  </li>
      <li>Heats super fast and tightens quickly!</li>
      <li>The first time I wanted to use it, it would not heat up!  </li>
      <li>I gave it four stars only because it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off, a nice safety feature.</li>
      <li>I liked the 1/2 inch iron, but i was looking for a smaller size barrel.   </li>
      <li>Received it today, as promised, and tried it right away.  </li>
      <li>the weight of the cord pulls it right off or will turn the curling iron on its side.  </li>
      <li>Great small curling iron.</li>
      <li>the shipping was so fast!</li>
      <li>so it isn&#x27;t because I am using this size for the first time</li>
      <li>The iron I received looks exactly like what was pictured.</li>
      <li>It worked better on my moderately short hair than this one does.  </li>
      <li>I have been looking for the perfect small barrel curling iron and after buying 4-5 i finally found it</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>Like this new one, quick to heat up and does what it is supposed to do</li>
      <li>It gets hot (except where the insulation is at the very end) and gets in the way sometimes.  </li>
      <li>So easy to catch my short hair.</li>
      <li>it is easy to handle and grip is solid, will not slide out of your hand.</li>
      <li>This is a real review from a real person who bought this item and uses it every day.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making this iron.</li>
      <li>The plastic barrel is very loose and is made of a type of plastic that I am sure would crack without a problem were I to drop it.</li>
      <li>I like the Helen of Troy curling brush so much that I bought the curling iron.</li>
      <li>It just doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
      <li>IT HEATS FAST AND CURLS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This iron works very well.  </li>
      <li>I have short, fine hair and the Helen of Troy 1/2- inch iron produces curls quickly that last.  </li>
      <li>The iron works very well, and the price is decent.</li>
      <li>It is heating on high when the word &amp;#34;HIGH&amp;#34; is covered, just as it is off when the word &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; is covered.  </li>
      <li>I had it on the high setting and nothing happened.  </li>
      <li>Yes, it was a cheap price, but only $1.00 less than what appear to more substantial curlers with multiple settings.  </li>
      <li>Live and learn.  </li>
      <li>i dont see how people say this doesnt get hot enough</li>
      <li>However the iron does not get hot enough to hold the curl and it takes awhile for the iron to heat up.</li>
      <li>I have short hair and it is straight!  </li>
      <li>Does not get hot enough to curl.</li>
      <li>The spring-control sticks out at a pretty big angle.  </li>
      <li>hair is fine and has a slight natural wave.  </li>
      <li>When you switch to &#x27;high&#x27;, both the high and low settings show.  </li>
      <li>First, the settings are only high, low, off - and the button doesn&#x27;t coincide with those settings!  </li>
      <li>replaced one that was old and no longer workable.  </li>
      <li>Using the Helen of Troy model, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl all day like it did with my old curling iron.  </li>
      <li>Really like the small barrel for my short hair...heats up quickly...</li>
      <li>And when it finally does, it barely works.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This item only lasted one week then wouldn&#x27;t heat up again.</li>
    <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever used.  I have short, fine hair and the Helen of Troy 1/2- inch iron produces curls quickly that last.  This is the only brand that my hair dresser uses.  It will not tip over if you let the weight of the cord hang over the counter edge.</li>
    <li> The area to hold is way too small. Burned myself multiple times. Returned for a refund. Still waiting on refund.</li>
    <li> I have short hair and it is straight!  I don&#x27;t look good with straight hair - must have curls.  This curling iron does the job!  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Needed a curing iron for small curls and this one worked great!! My daughter was in a wedding party and I did her hair with this curling iron. The curls stayed in all day!! Would definitely recommend this product to all my friends!</li>
    <li> i dont see how people say this doesnt get hot enough i love it! its perfect and love the size its perfect for my short hairs when i want a whimsical up doo</li>
    <li> The spring is not as tight as others i have bought.  It&#x27;s very hard to curl as the grasp is so loose.  Very hard to hold a curl.  The tighter the spring the better curl you will get.  Something has recently changed since I last bought this iron.</li>
    <li> What a waste of money! It doesn&#x27;t even get very hot and it turns off super easy so you always have to check it to make sure it still turned on ... I hated the size I hate everything about it wish I never bought it</li>
    <li> Really like the small barrel for my short hair...heats up quickly...looks well made.</li>
    <li> DOES WHAT ITS SAYS. ORDERED FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER AND SHE LIKES IT, HOPEFULLY IT WILL LAST AS LONG AS ITS SAYS.</li>
    <li> Perfect curling iron for short hair.</li>
    <li> I liked the 1/2 inch iron, but i was looking for a smaller size barrel.   I will give this as a gift.      thank you  Peggy Carlson  peggyc996@yahoo.com</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough to curl. Very disappointed wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to use it I would have returned it.</li>
    <li> Takes forever to heat up. And when it finally does, it barely works. I&#x27;ve used many curling ifons, and they always work on my hair because its fine.</li>

    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped it would.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best curling irons i have ever had. the cord doesn&#x27;t coil up. it is easy to handle and grip is solid, will not slide out of your hand. This is a real review from a real person who bought this item and uses it every day.</li>
    <li> While the size of this curling iron is nice, it isn&#x27;t a great tool.  It takes a while to heat up; doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut-off.  It just doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I have a short hair cut, so the width of the curling iron was perfect. However the iron does not get hot enough to hold the curl and it takes awhile for the iron to heat up. This maybe a good purchase for a tween if your concerned about them using a iron that gets too hot.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a small curling iron like this locally, so I ordered this one from Amazon. The iron works very well, and the price is decent. I gave it four stars only because it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off, a nice safety feature. I did not know that before ordering or I probably wouldn&#x27;t have done so.</li>
    <li> The handle is too smoothe so when I am using it, it slips out of my hands to easily. okay?</li>
    <li> I needed a small curling Iron for my short Very stright hair.  This iron works very well.  I have curls in no time.</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need of a small barrelled curling iron and actually got it early</li>
    <li> Thanks for making this iron. I had been looking for this size for app one year and finally came upon this one. The size is what I was looking for. It also makes ur hair shine when using it.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and just need to round edges to soften the look. This iron is the perfect size. Well made and looks like it will last for a long time.</li>
    <li> replaced one that was old and no longer workable.  Like this new one, quick to heat up and does what it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Great small curling iron. I like the Helen of Troy curling brush so much that I bought the curling iron. Not disappointed.</li>
    <li> A great curling iron for short hair.</li>
    <li> Very light and flimsy.  I go to lay it down on the counter and the weight of the cord pulls it right off or will turn the curling iron on its side.  Spend the extra couple dollars and don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
    <li> Work great and is just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Heats super fast and tightens quickly!</li>
    <li> It is not easy to use it. I tried it to curl my bang but it is difficult. So I bought another curler.</li>
    <li> I needed to return this product. Unfortunately it broke when I first tried to use it. It also seemed poorly made.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted.  This size cannot be found in the stores.  A little easier to handle for arthritic hands.</li>
    <li> THE BEST CURLING IRON I HAVE EVER HAD. IT HEATS FAST AND CURLS GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BE BACK! THANK YOU!5</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this. So easy to catch my short hair.</li>
    <li> Not a very good product.</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with this curling iron.  It holds my hair perfectly and does a great job.  I would have appreciated an  indicator light to let me know when it&#x27;s fully heated, but for the price, I&#x27;m still happy.  However, it took me some time to figure out the switch.  The first time I wanted to use it, it would not heat up!  I had it on the high setting and nothing happened.  I was all set to return it, but then decided to play around with it and discovered that the switch is just really weird.  The setting that appears to be &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; is actually &amp;#34;off&amp;#34;.  It is heating on high when the word &amp;#34;HIGH&amp;#34; is covered, just as it is off when the word &amp;#34;OFF&amp;#34; is covered.  My husband agrees (which proves my point!) that it&#x27;s a very confusing way to word a switch.  Nevertheless, since I got it figured out, I&#x27;ve been very happy using this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this as an extra iron before leaving on a trip.  Hard to find 1/2&amp;#34; barrels.  Received it today, as promised, and tried it right away.  First, the settings are only high, low, off - and the button doesn&#x27;t coincide with those settings!  When you switch to &#x27;high&#x27;, both the high and low settings show.  The &#x27;off&#x27; button is just blank.  The high setting is luke warm at best and the low setting almost non-existent.  Yes, it was a cheap price, but only $1.00 less than what appear to more substantial curlers with multiple settings.  Live and learn.  Had to order another brand today in order for it to arrive before my trip.  Will be returning this one for sure.</li>
    <li> This is a good, basic curling iron.  Nothing fancy.  The spring-control sticks out at a pretty big angle.  It gets hot (except where the insulation is at the very end) and gets in the way sometimes.  If the control bar hits your neck or your ear, watch out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and has a slight natural wave.  I like to wear it curly so I twist it up into pin-curls at night.  In the morning I usually have to tame some of the pin-curls to not stick out at a weird angle, so I use a curling iron.  My old curling iron got hotter than this one, and had a little bit smaller barrel.  It worked better on my moderately short hair than this one does.  Using the Helen of Troy model, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold the curl all day like it did with my old curling iron.  For the price it&#x27;s fine.  But given the chance, I&#x27;ll buy a better quality model.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed for shorter hair.  This smaller curling diameter was almost impossible to find in stores. I really use this everyday.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for the perfect small barrel curling iron and after buying 4-5 i finally found it and it was so cheap and the shipping was so fast! I love it!</li>
    <li> Not so easy to use.  Easy to burn ear or scalp.  Doesn&#x27;t make very good curls.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Could not find the correct size locally, but this one does the trick.  I recommend it for shorter hair.</li>
