      <li>, I am very happy.</li>
      <li>I think its excellent to use for any occation.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s the best.</li>
      <li>Very good price.</li>
      <li>Beautiful.</li>
      <li>The color is great, but for some reason the teal tends to smudge around during the day.</li>
      <li>Beautiful color, good staying power.</li>
      <li>The hours would fly by and you will STILL have your eyes and waterline perfectly lined just like from the first application!  </li>
      <li>its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
      <li>Beautiful color and stays on pretty well after a good blending</li>
      <li>as a color it is GORGEOUS, so possibly worth it</li>
      <li>Love all of the HiP Kohl Liners that I have.</li>
      <li>It was my mistake, I thought this would be more of a liquid kohl eyeliner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is pure love!</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and stays all day.</li>
      <li>I bought two colors of this, gold and black - the gold arrived first, and it&#x27;s just perfect!</li>
      <li>Easy to use to create eyeliner with not to much fuss.</li>
      <li>This is a rich, vibrant teal.</li>
      <li>im trying to get every color, this ones a pretty teal shade.</li>
      <li>The color is pretty, but it flaked off and fell on my cheeks, so it isn&#x27;t practical for use.</li>
      <li>When I use this product I have to put it on first</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think I have EVER seen an eye product with such powerful pigmentation!</li>
      <li>I have trouble putting it on, but it is a good product all the same.</li>
      <li>what i love about this line is that the powder is actually REALLY long lasting in the water line.</li>
      <li>It really is so gorgeous, I am addicted to it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to apply (as long as you&#x27;re not too squeamish about putting things in your eye) and the gold color is fabulous and long lasting.</li>
      <li>Be prepared for some clean up after applying, just like with any loose powder liner.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the teal, for some reason I have to be super careful</li>
      <li>If you apply with a pressing motion instead of sweeping it on like a pencil, there is less clean up.</li>
      <li>Doesnt lool good at all, got a wrong color.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner was a pretty color but seemed to be all dried out, like this was an old bottle.  </li>
      <li>applied thoroughly and carefully with several sweeps it really does tints and STAYS!</li>
      <li>I really did enjoy the color of this eyeliner, but the tip of the applicator slowly began to curl after a few days of use.</li>
      <li>the powder inside that little bottle is pure magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> the powder inside that little bottle is pure magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know that this would be useful for say, a thick, heavy upper lid line, but for the classic kohl look</li>
<li> It will get everywhere, it is highly pigmented so cleaning it off is also messy.  </li>
<li> for how long it last, well, it literally stayed in my eyes for longer than 3 DAYS!  </li>
<li> i thought it&#x27;s black, but it is dark green, and very pretty!</li>
<li> I was soo looking forward to this liner and when it came I discovered that it was all dried up and old.</li>
<li> I am definitely getting all the other colors</li>
<li> I mean I would remove the make up before going to bed and the next morning I would YET AGAIN wake up with a faint delicate teal tint around my lower and upper lashes, seriously, this is amazing powerful</li>
<li> It was very dry and powdery, despite the fact that it was a LIQUID eyeliner.</li>
<li> The packaging makes it worse as you cannot control how much powder to apply to the applicator wand.  </li>
<li> The only use I found for it was as an eyeshadow and that&#x27;s a terrible waste of good money.</li>
<li> apply them to my lower eyelid and never go without one or the other of the colors.</li>
<li> Really dry and brush is too stiff</li>
<li> it came fast but was sad that the color wasnt black and that it wasnt liquid.</li>
<li> I have the black, brown, burgundy, navy and the teal.</li>
<li> its very dry and hard to apply.</li>
<li> but it is sooo messy.  </li>
<li> I can&#x27;t wait for the black to show up!</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why</li>
<li> Very flakey, very disappointing.</li>
<li> The whole thing is all dried out, texture is terrible, not to mention stiff brush and really hard to use.</li>
<li> and when i looked into the mirrer later, i has that ugly flaky green stuff all over my face!</li>
<li> It stayed on all day, and made a perfectly thin line of gold just at the waterline and the base of my upper lashes.</li>
<li> but it did make it difficult to apply.</li>
<li> but it was overall terrible.</li>
<li> you buy :(((</li>
<li> Worst eyeliner ive ever had!</li>

    <li> I have the black, brown, burgundy, navy and the teal. Out of all of them, this is the one that smudges. Notaall the time, just please keep checking the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply them to my lower eyelid and never go without one or the other of the colors. It&#x27;s just the teal, for some reason I have to be super careful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a color it is GORGEOUS, so possibly worth it</li>
    <li> I bought two colors of this, gold and black - the gold arrived first, and it&#x27;s just perfect!

    <li> i didnt read the info befor i got this . it came fast but was sad that the color wasnt black and that it wasnt liquid. so it does work and it as it says it is but read befor you buy :(((</li>
    <li> Easy to use to create eyeliner with not to much fuss. Very good price. I think its excellent to use for any occation.</li>
    <li> I was soo looking forward to this liner and when it came I discovered that it was all dried up and old. I had to return it.</li>
    <li> The color is pretty, but it flaked off and fell on my cheeks, so it isn&#x27;t practical for use. I would not recommend purchasing this.</li>
    <li> its very dry and hard to apply.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I wanted</li>
    <li> This eyeliner was a pretty color but seemed to be all dried out, like this was an old bottle.  Very flakey, very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Worst eyeliner ive ever had! The whole thing is all dried out, texture is terrible, not to mention stiff brush and really hard to use. Doesnt lool good at all, got a wrong color. I put it on, left the house and when i looked into the mirrer later, i has that ugly flaky green stuff all over my face! Never buy that</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I have EVER seen an eye product with such powerful pigmentation! the powder inside that little bottle is pure magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the teal color is SO BEAUTIFUL!! I have brown eyes and whenever I use this product they GLOW. It&#x27;s a match made in heaven I could say!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how long it last, well, it literally stayed in my eyes for longer than 3 DAYS!  I mean I would remove the make up before going to bed and the next morning I would YET AGAIN wake up with a faint delicate teal tint around my lower and upper lashes, seriously, this is amazing powerful stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied thoroughly and carefully with several sweeps it really does tints and STAYS! It really is so gorgeous, I am addicted to it. The hours would fly by and you will STILL have your eyes and waterline perfectly lined just like from the first application!  I can not praise L&#x27;oreal enough for this wonder. I am definitely getting all the other colors available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is pure love!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color, good staying power. An excellent product!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think that I would recommend this product to anyone, seeing the texture of the eyeliner. It was very dry and powdery, despite the fact that it was a LIQUID eyeliner. I attempted to use it but it obviously didn&#x27;t work, so I put some eyedrops in it but it was overall terrible. The only use I found for it was as an eyeshadow and that&#x27;s a terrible waste of good money.</li>
    <li> its a great product for a super nice price, I would recommend it to everyone that likes good stuff, Try it</li>
    <li> what i love about this line is that the powder is actually REALLY long lasting in the water line. im trying to get every color, this ones a pretty teal shade.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and stays on pretty well after a good blending but it is sooo messy.  It will get everywhere, it is highly pigmented so cleaning it off is also messy.  The packaging makes it worse as you cannot control how much powder to apply to the applicator wand.  When I use this product I have to put it on first and then do the rest of my face so I won&#x27;t get any powder on my finished look.</li>
    <li> i thought it&#x27;s black, but it is dark green, and very pretty! It was supposed to be delievered at the end of the month, but I got it ten days earlier, I am very happy.</li>
    <li> It was my mistake, I thought this would be more of a liquid kohl eyeliner. I have trouble putting it on, but it is a good product all the same.</li>
    <li> I really did enjoy the color of this eyeliner, but the tip of the applicator slowly began to curl after a few days of use. I&#x27;m not sure why but it did make it difficult to apply.</li>
    <li> Love all of the HiP Kohl Liners that I have. This is a rich, vibrant teal. It goes on smoothly and stays all day. Beautiful.</li>
