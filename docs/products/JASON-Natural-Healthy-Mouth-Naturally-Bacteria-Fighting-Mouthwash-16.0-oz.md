<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the Jason brand of mouth wash.  Bought two of them and I am loving them.  Strong but just what I needed.  Feel clean safe and health in my mouth.</li>
    <li> I love the taste of this mouthwash, which I use along with cinnamon clove toothpaste so there is no clashing of flavors. It makes my mouth feel fresh.</li>
    <li> Very good mouthwash.  I do water it down just a little.  It works well.  recommended!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the taste at all.</li>
    <li> No alcohol.  Use it before blowing on my tuba.</li>
    <li> My SO and I love this mouth wash. It has a great taste and makes your mouth feel clean and healthy. The grocery store stopped selling it so we have started ordering from Amazon. Because it is a Prime item we pay the same amount as the store.</li>
    <li> I love the Jason products, and have been using them for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I have tried the mouthwash, and personally,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it.  It left a bitter taste in my mouth that I could taste&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a few hours later.</li>
    <li> I like the factor Jason is trying to make natural healthy mouthwashes for those who actually care as opposed to that junk the store is trying to sell you in the generically labeled bottle.  I still wish people would wake up and realize that alchol anti septic stuff isnot good for your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Jason for giving us an alternative!</li>
    <li> Love Jason mouth products. It doesn&#x27;t have all those chemicals and preservatives harming the body.</li>
    <li> Very good natural moutwash.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash. Very strong cinnamon flavor but can be diluted. First started using Jason&#x27;s products 12 years ago to help peritonitis issues and worked great.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive teeth, the menthol in this mouthwash will not feel good!</li>
    <li> I love the cinnamon and clove taste, BUT, it is very STRONG!!!  So you may want to dilute it!  It says on bottle that it is concentrated.  If you don&#x27;t like strong cloves and cinnamon, stay away from this one.  My mouth feels very refreshed afterwards. I&#x27;m hoping it will help heal up some gum problems I am having.  Cloves is good for the mouth.</li>
    <li> We refill this order often and enjoy the product and the service.</li>
    <li> I liked the flavor and the consistency. Noticeable gum improvement over 6 months of use. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> way to sweet, I felt like my teeth were covered with &amp;#34;sugary staff&amp;#34; that I had to rinse after I used it. I tried it two times and tossed rest of it.</li>
    <li> I found this mouthwash after researching homeopathic solutions for my receding gums.  It seems to be helping (though in truth, I am trying a bunch of things at the same time) - but even if it doesn&#x27;t fix my gums, it&#x27;s a terrific mouthwash that feels really clean and much less &amp;#34;chemical-ly&amp;#34; than most of the major store brands.  It takes a couple of uses to get used to the strong tea tree oil flavor....but hang in there, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I am in the process of swearing off all dentists, who only seem interested in telling me how much money I have to spend on fixing my gums and teeth with everything from deep gum cleanings to crowns, etc.... So I bought a couple of books (also through Amazon) on taking a homeopathic approach to dental/gum care at home, and already I&#x27;m seeing major positive results. This product has all the ingredients that help keep the gums healthy naturally, which includes keeping the ph of the mouth alkaline and not acidic, as well as keeping it a good environment for the right kind of bacteria (not plaque forming bacteria). I loved the fact that this mouth wash fits in with the recommendations of my homeopathic dental care books. My only criticism: The taste could be a bit better....</li>
    <li> This stuff is very different from your minty-fresh mouthwash. The clove, cinnamon and tea tree flavor are pretty strong. The first time using, I was a little overwhelmed but now I use less and love it. The flavor is pretty great and my mouth feels super clean.</li>
    <li> I was extremely satisfied with this product. In the recent past, I had decided to cut out harsh chemicals if possible, or at least reduce them. I also quick alcohol and wanted something without. This fit the bill on every level. I felt as though I was doing something great for my teeth and mouth. If you read the bottle you will find many amazing natural ingredients shown to help with the health of your mouth. My breath was extremely fresh after use and improved the health of my teeth! Thank you Jason</li>
    <li> Tastes good and does the job!</li>
    <li> I have only been using it for two weeks, but it seems to be really well for my gums.</li>
    <li> Great all natural mouthwash. Love that they used natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. It&#x27;s concentrated so most people may want to dilute with water.</li>
    <li> This is some seriously strong mouthwash. It had a great price, though, and came very fast. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This is my second favorite flavor, almost as delicious as the Orange cinnamint. I highly recommend these. My breath doesn&#x27;t kick nearly as bad in the a.m. as it does without using and there&#x27;s no drying or burning alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;You can dilute 50% water, I don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ME TO RECEIVE THIS MOUTH WASH, 12-15 AND LET&#x27;S JUST SAY IT WAS NOT WORTH THE WAIT. AFTER I USED THIS STUFF ONCE, I HAD TO EAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD DEADEN THE TASTE OF THE CLOVES, WHICH IS REALLY BITTER. SO I ATE A PIECE OF STALE MINT GUM, WHICH TRUST ME TASTED BETTER THAN THIS MOUTHWASH. IT&#x27;S ALSO REALLY SWEET, TOO SWEET. IT&#x27;S NOT FOR ME. LISTERINE DENTIST CLEAN IS MUCH BETTER AND EFFECTIVE. TO EAH HIS OWN.</li>
    <li> Like knowing this product is made of natural ingredients and a surprise bonus was that it makes my teeth whiter when using at full strength. You can dilute it which is what I do now.</li>
    <li> i was a little scared about the taste of this, since i don&#x27;t love clove, but it&#x27;s actually quite refreshing.  i will order this again, and i like it even better than mint!</li>
    <li> It works and has great ingredients</li>
    <li> Firstly, let me tell you the best way to use this mouthwash in my opinion is to use it just before you go to sleep. The reason is that the ingredients resist the action during the night of sugar formation on the teeth, when alot of the damage occurs.  The Perilla seed extract and some of the botanicals resist that.  Since I started to use this in this way along with a Radius Tooth brush and JASON Toothpaste with Co-Q10, I have -0- trips to the dentist!</li>
    <li> Love it, I feel clean and I love the taste.</li>
    <li> Although a lot of people complained about the taste, I actually love it&#x3D;.&#x3D;! but I found it is cheaper in the local stores nearby, so probably won&#x27;t buy from amazon anymore</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash.  This is my 2nd bottle.  I would recommend diluting it with water, because it&#x27;s potent stuff.  Until this cinnamon/clove rinse, I&#x27;d thought all organic mouth rinses too mamby-pamby.  I wanted a clean freshness [like the old reliable Listerine]; but without the nasty chemical-alcohol of the Listerine pack. This gives you a super clean mouth and freshens breath for a longer time than anything I&#x27;ve tried.  I have sensitive teeth, too, and &amp;#34;Healthy Mouth&amp;#34; accommodates them nicely.  It IS expensive; but, again, if you dilute it, it&#x27;s much more economical and lasts longer than you might imagine.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash. Best natural mouthwash I&#x27;ve tried! It&#x27;s gentle but works well! No mouth-drying alcohol or nasty ingredients.</li>
    <li> My all time favorite mouthwash!!  What a healthy blend of grapefruit seed extract, tea tree oil, cinnamon, cloves, aloe........which makes your mouth and teeth feel REALLY clean.  Tartar build up seems to become a non issue, and cavity activity too - for me, at least!  It might take you, as it did me, a few times before you get used to the really clean - non sugary - taste, but I&#x27;m sure that if you try it you will like it!!</li>
    <li> I use this for a few months because I was looking for more natural products, but later switched to another brand.  The taste wasn&#x27;t all that great.  Overall, it wasn&#x27;t a bad product, but wasn&#x27;t one I continued to use.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Got it quick too.</li>
    <li> Good natural Mouthwash.  Not the best tasting. However, it is effective at doing what it should be doing. No problems with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mouthwash ever. Very strong, don&#x27;t let the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; label make you think it&#x27;s going to be weak. But I like strong first thing in the morning and before bed.  I wear a mouthguard and love swishing with this first thing before I take it out and brush it, feels like I&#x27;m cleaning more thoroughly. Great for gargling if you have a sore throat.  My mouth feels so clean after this.  I even put some in a spray bottle and brought to work for those long afternoons when your mouth needs a little refresher.  Perfect.</li>
    <li> Wanted to try this as I don&#x27;t like all the artificial colors, flavors and preservatives that are used in the big-name brands you find at the market. You have to wonder what long-term exposure to that stuff is doing to you after swallowing even a tiny bit every day over a long period of time! I have to admit it took me a few days to get used to the &amp;#34;Jason&amp;#34; mouthwash. You don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;alcohol burn&amp;#34; which you can&#x27;t help associating with &amp;#34;it&#x27;s doing a good job&amp;#34;. Due to the tea tree oil it kind of feels like you are swilling salad dressing, so you have to get your mind around that as well. That being said, it has a pleasant, but not overly strong, flavor and your mouth feels fresh for hours afterward, not just minutes. I usually have something to eat within an hour of using the mouthwash, but even after eating my mouth still feels &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Decent, quite a strong flavor. One can taste the underlying cinnamon, it&#x27;s like a punch to the tongue, but in a good way. It does make my mouth feel fresher. It certainly feels better than alcohol based mouth washes which temporarily feel good then seem to leave the mouth dead, and worse later.</li>
    <li> taste like cloves, but it its good for the breath.</li>
    <li> This is good-tasting natural mouthwash. No alcohol or saccharin. The only \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; ingredients are glycerin, polysorbate 20, calcium ascorbate, menthol, and sodium bicarbonate. I just wish they&#x27;d give you a little more for your money, 16 ounces doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
    <li> I like this line of mouthwash, and no complaints from the family.</li>
    <li> Really good product. Nor your average mouthwash...interesting flavor... no animal ingredients, which is always GREAT and makes it environmentally responsible</li>
    <li> Very strong tasting and I read it&#x27;s one of the most powerful mouthwashes on the market. It doesn&#x27;t freshen your breath for a long time but I bought it more for its anti-bacterial qualities.</li>
    <li> I will buy this again, I use it twice a day and it has helped at the dentist</li>
    <li> When using this product, my teeth feel as clean when i wake in the morning as they do when freshly brushed. Great tartar control. The taste.... Well it tastes like tea tree oil, which I do don&#x27;t care for. I will keep using it just for its effectiveness.</li>
    <li> Great taste (if you like cinnamon and clove), and the tea tree oil is good for my gums and oral health. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> At first, the smell of mouthwash feels unpleasant but using it for a while, the smell’s got used to it. It cleans the mouth entirely. But you may need to use it many times to cure gums bleeding and infection. Recommend it.</li>
    <li> Please give this a chance.  The taste is quite strong at first but you will grow accustomed to it and it leaves a very fresh and clean taste in your mouth,</li>
    <li> Works well to get rid of bacteria in mouth, must gargle for 30 sec min. Taste is not as bad as I feared (I usually prefer mint) and it makes my mouth feel fresh without alcohol.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a fresh feeling. I think this would be great for someone with achy teeth.</li>
    <li> I should have read the ingredients before purchasing.  After water the number 2 ingredient is polysorbate 20. SCARY. I looked it up and learned it is a chemical that makes oil mix with water. SCARY. I was disappointed to say the least, but decided to use it. I did 3 times and found it lousy tasting. The cinnamon flavor seems only to hide something even worse. It makes bad breath a different kind of bad.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It makes your mouth feel clean without feeling like you just swished with a bunch of chemicals. I have never been into using mouthwash for that reason. The taste isn&#x27;t bad at all and I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn the whole time you are swishing. Great service, wonderful product. Will definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> I am very sad to report I found the taste positively disgusting. And I had bought it for my 6 year old son, who would have hated it even more. I love Jason products and really wanted to like this (wanted something to help neutralize sugars in my son&#x27;s mouth to prevent decay, which he&#x27;s prone to). So now I&#x27;ll need to look for something else.</li>
    <li> My family has been using this product for years. Recently, due to a problem affecting my gums, I have needed to use it regularly to keep the problem from getting any worse. This mouthwash contains natural healing ingredients including cloves, which I find soothing to sore gums. This is a regular product for us, and I make sure we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I only buy this mouthwash.  For years I used the name brands available at the grocery store, but I hated how they would burn.  This uses natural bacteria fighting ingredients and leaves my mouth clean and fresh feeling without the burning.  Tea Tree oil is awesome and I would recommend this to anyone looking to go the natural route that still wants an effective mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mouthwash for one reason: teatree oil. The taste of cloves and cinnamon are very strong and off-putting to all but the few who enjoy that taste. I was hoping for a mild taste of those two ingredients but unfortunately that is not the case. Unless this is something you think you might like, I would avoid this mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It&#x27;s now several weeks later and I&#x27;ve re-ordered this mouthwash twice in that time. The taste is still very strong BUT it grows on you after a while. I had an oral issue which the tea tree oil set straight and so I continue to use this product. My only caution would be for those purchasing the mouthwash to be aware that the taste of cloves and cinnamon is very potent so a &amp;#34;little dab will do ya&amp;#34; if you understand the adage.</li>
    <li> My opinion of this is not of it doing or not doing what it&#x27;s for.  I just don&#x27;t like this flavor.</li>
    <li> Love the taste, and how it makes the mouth feel clean. The first time using love it. I would order again from this company.  The package was tightly sealed received in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great and helps heal mouth sores too</li>
    <li> My favorite mouthwash! Great flavor and aftertaste! Leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean without the burn.</li>
    <li> It tastes super nice, I did have to cut with water, but overall great.</li>
    <li> I am a regular sufferer of abscess issues from periodontal infections and since using this product, my issues have decreased substantially.  Flavor is a bit weird and takes awhile to get used to, but I am a fan.  It works.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product. I love the flavor, the price and the feel after use. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Once you get over the taste being so different from most mouthwashes, it&#x27;s all right.  I bought this as a mouthwash to combat morning sickness while pregnant because mint was bothering me.  Works, so no complaints there.  It&#x27;s also orange, if that would bug you.</li>
    <li> My husband has a couple of cavities and we have not been able to get to the dentist. I bought this for him and he started using it.  The pain in his cavities is almost gone.  We still need to have them filled, of course, but this mouthwash is very healing with tea tree oil.  It does not taste the best, but it is effective.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
    <li> If you have gum or teeth problems, BUY THIS. Sometime around 2008, I developed an infection in a tooth that destroyed a small piece of bone around the root of a molar. By the time I got it taken care of, the endodontist told me that there was so little bone left to hold the tooth in, I&#x27;d likely lose it. I opted to try and save it.  Spoiler alert: I still have the tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remembered that my dentist would pack my teeth with clove oil as a disinfectant and anti-bacterial treatment when doing a filling, so when i left the endodontist, I picked up a tube of Tom&#x27;s Clove and Cinnamon toothpaste, and a bottle of this mouth wash. I used them both religiously ever since, and though I was told I&#x27;d be lucky to keep that tooth for 6 months, it&#x27;s been almost 7 years and it&#x27;s still with me, and the crown even fell out once and they put it back in, and no infection! I totally credit this mouthwash and clove toothpaste combo for my good gum and teeth health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You also use this in diluted form, so when you buy 1 bottle, depending on how much you dilute it (I go with 2:1) you will get 2 bottles worth of product, which also makes it an amazing value. The taste is quite strong, but it doesn&#x27;t linger too long, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth at all.</li>
    <li> So far so good. I will let you know how it&#x27;s going later.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an alcohol-free mouthwash and decided to try JASON.  The cinnamon-clove taste is horrible!  I couldn&#x27;t get the taste out of my mouth!  I don&#x27;t think I can try it again.  $13 flushed down the toilet!</li>
