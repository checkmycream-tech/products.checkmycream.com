<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product for hair and skin. My wife also uses this for makeup removing and moisturizing. She likes to also use it with her DoTerra essential oils. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Love love love how it makes my skin feels and how easily it mixes with essiential oils</li>
    <li> Received my fractionated coconut oil in the mail yesterday. I&#x27;m an avid essential oil user and use coconut oil frequently as a carrier oil. This is a large size bottle that will last forever. Great price!</li>
    <li> This is definitely a staple product in my beauty regime and one that has a lot of uses.  This oil is great alone for my skin, it is great to use when mixing up with other oils and butters for my hair and also as a body butter.  It blends well and is light weight.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair or leave a greasy residue.  I love that it is fractionated so it maintains it&#x27;s liquid state.  This product is versatile and I definitely plan to purchase again.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious. I love the product, Easier than the solid coconut oil!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. The product is light and absorb quick.</li>
    <li> I use this oil for my hair I love it, it is not heavy like other oils and feels great on my scalp</li>
    <li> I like this oil for massages and you can add other oils to make different scents because this one is unscented.</li>
    <li> I love the size and amount. The product has made my skin feel super soft. i will definitely get this product again and again. It is worth it to get this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this in my kids hair to keep it moisturized and in place throughout the day instead of gel or hair spray and it has been working pretty well. I only need a VERY small amount so I know this will last me quite a while.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  But leaks really bad.</li>
    <li> I have had this oil for one day and I tried it first on my skin which is extremely dry.  I worked great to moisturize and it did not leave my skin greasy.  I absolutely loved how it made my skin feel and look.  I will definitely try this oil for other purposes but so far I am highly pleased.  Thanks for this!!!  I only wish I would have known about this oil sooner.  It is fragrance free which makes it perfect to blend with other fragrant moisturizers I may want to use with this.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and smell of the product! This was something new for me as we are just beginning to incorporate oils into our home.  It has so many  uses and comes in a large size that we cannot wait to try all of the great uses.</li>
    <li> Great oil! I use it as a carrier for my essential oils. I love it!</li>
    <li> My son has really dry skin. He always say mommy I itchy. I have heard that coconut oil was really good for your skin. I have been using this on my son for about a week now and I haven&#x27;t heard him complain about being itchy. Every even after his bath, I oil him down. I am a big fan!!!!</li>
    <li> Works great as a lotion. Can be messy though, would&#x27;ve been better in a pump type bottle instead.</li>
    <li> I love this oil,so far i have used it on my skin and as a leave in for my hair. It worked amazingly on both. The label says that it has many other uses as well and I cannot wait to try. I am a big fan of a product that has a lot of uses and this is one of them for sure.</li>
    <li> Great oil! I love its many uses!!! Every household should have coconut oil!</li>
    <li> I have been using this oil on my skin after every shower.  Adding about 20 drops of Lavender essential oil to the entire bottle gives this oil a nice light scent.  My skin is softer than it has been in a long time!</li>
    <li> My massage therapist has been using coconut oil during my massage and I absolutely love how my skin feels after. So when I was offered this Fractionated Coconut Oil from Ommm Health and Beauty for a great deal to try and share my honest thoughts about it, I ordered it right away. As soon as the mail lady delivered my Fractionated Coconut Oil, I took it out of the sealed package (no leaking), and started using it! It is the best way to moisturize your body without greasy or oily feeling after. Another awesome thing is how  long it lasts! My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this good since my last massage! I definitely recommend this Fractionated Coconut Oil from Ommm Health and Beauty!</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Great for so many things. Love it to make my hair soft!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I put a little in my hand and used it in my hair. It made it super shiny and soft. I also used this as a moisturizer and it made my skin soft. There&#x27;s no smell to it so it&#x27;s not over powering at all.</li>
    <li> The opportunity was given to me to test and review this product. I was very please with this 100$ Fractionated Coconut Carrier Oil. There are many uses for this oil. There are some you use for cooking and some for external with essential oils. This particular one is for external use. I usually add a few drops of my favorite scented essential oil to my coconut oil and apply to my skin, making my skin feel soft and moisturized and radiant.&lt;br /&gt;Another use that I use it for is for making my own homemade soap and body butters. I&#x27;ve been using coconut oil for a while now and will continue to use it.  This oil is great for aromatherapy use, I mean who doesn&#x27;t enjoy a nice massage from time to time and what better oil to use than 100% Fracionated Coconut Oil by Ommm Health and Beauty Products.</li>
    <li> Perfect to use as a carrier oil for my capsules that I add essential oils to. Also use it as a carrier oil for pain cream etc.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love using this oil in my skin right after a shower in order for it to absorb quickly and find that the scent is light and it does not have a greasy residue. I would feel comfortable using this in my face as well as it is light and doesn&#x27;t clog pores on other parts of my body.  It is a large bottle so it should last a family for a few months, a little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve also used it on my scalp when it feels itchy and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this coconut oil.  I&#x27;m using it on my daughter&#x27;s eczema spots and it worked very well from the first application.  It goes on oily but then dries up very nicely.  I am also using it on my hair to smooth it.  There is no odor.  I probably will be purchasing another bottle soon.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This coconut oil is perfect for use ad a carrier oil and for all of my hygiene needs. I am really impressed by the quality of Ommm Health and Beauty&#x27;s Fractionated Coconut Oil. I am definitely going to be adding this brand into my daily Healthcare routine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many different brands for numwrous applications and I can honestly claim this brand in my top 5 of all the brands. Ommm Health and Beauty has my attention now. I had bragged about this Coconut Oil to my nieces step-father - she&#x27;s a massage therapist. So when she asked if she could try it I took some to her to try. She was so impressed by the oil that she purchased 2 bottles the same day.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a 5 star product. Not only is the oil a great product, the company is all about the customer. They&#x27;re very helpful if you have any issues or questions. And the product was well protected and shipped fast. This is the carrier oil that you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I purchased this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. *</li>
    <li> The main reason that I got this is because my oldest daughter has psoriasis very badly on her scalp and the only thing that seems to help there is coconut oil. I have only ever bought the one at the grocery before which works wonders but it really hard to wash out. She is also pretty young so it is hard to convince her to wash her hair well enough and enough times to get it out. There isn&#x27;t as much trouble with this because by morning it is absorbed where it needs to be and we don&#x27;t have that much to wash out in the morning to go to school. I love that I can use all natural products for her instead of the prescriptions that we have been having to use on her. The other option that we were given was to take her to the tanning bed.... I didn&#x27;t like that to begin with but how is it supposed to get to her scalp??? This is a great solution.</li>
    <li> Large quantity coconut carrier oil, great quality and great value for the price. I was given a discount to try this product and give my opinion of it. I use it for my hair, and skin, and mixed with essential oils.</li>
    <li> There are so many uses for this. I love it as a moisturizer - it doesn&#x27;t clog pores and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I use coconut carrier oil for many purposes.  I&#x27;ve tried many brands and this is very great quality oil.  A little goes a long way so this 16 ounce bottle will last a long while.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best oil you can buy. this oil is a allrounder you can use it on ur hairs, body, massage and other stuff it works awesome again and again. best money spent.</li>
    <li> I looove this coconut oil!! I use it on my hair mainly. However it is good as a moisturizer on my skin. I use it for hot oil treatments on my hair in conjunction with almond oil and other hair products! Its great!</li>
    <li> This is a very good oil. I use it for all my 68 year old skin problems. I also use it for a deodorant it instead of the chemical ones I been using all my life. I wish there was a better way of getting it out of the bottle because it seems that some runs down the sides after I use it. I like the way it goes on and not stain my clothes or my sheets.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
    <li> This make my skin feel great and smell great</li>
    <li> Great product!  Love it!</li>
    <li> So far I love this!!! It has so many amazing uses and I&#x27;ve been working on trying them all. I&#x27;m definitely impressed with it as an intensive moisturizer, my fiancés elbows were very rough and dried up and this has really helped soften them up with just two applications!</li>
    <li> love it. good for my dry dry skin and hair.</li>
    <li> This is good as a carrying oil, but I use it on my cat! He has extremely dry skin and when I&#x27;m done combing him, I will would message this into his skin. It seems to relieve the itch but I don&#x27;t have be worried about him licking it since its healthy for him also!</li>
    <li> Smells great, already using it.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way. Needed it to make essential oil roll ons for my little ones. I love the big bottle that will last is a very long time. Will definitely buy again</li>
    <li> this is some great quality. no odor, and is one of the bests that I have ever used. It is easy to wash out of clothing which is a plus. I keep this one with my crafty supplies because I use it to make homemade lotions and stuff like that. I like to also use it as a massage oil with some lavender EO mixed with it for my boys before bed. It works wonders and it is not greasy!</li>
    <li> Good coconut oil, stays viscus at room temp.</li>
    <li> I love this coconut oil! Cooking, skin care, pet care, this does it all. If your tattoos are looking ashy just a little bit of oil and they brighten back up all day, not just until it wears off in hours like lotions.</li>
    <li> This oil comes out easy and you can use it for so many things. I have used it for my hair, skin and to remove makeup. It comes out quick and in the past, I have bought coconut oil that is for baking and this is much better for those purposes!</li>
    <li> I received this fractionated coconut carrier oil from Ommm Health and Beauty Products for a consumer review and have found it to be very useful. I like that you can use this on your dry and damaged skin or as a carrier oil for essential oils or as a massage agent or to help your hair grow back It can also be used for many other things. I have used this product for all four of the intentions that I listed, but am eager to try more. In case any one is wondering what fractionated means is that this coconut carrier oil uses fractions of a whole oil so that fatty acids can be separated and used for specific purposes. There is a light fragrance so unobtrusive that it is almost not worth mentioning, but I have a thing smells and I am ultra sensitive to things that stink. I always like to include the smell in my reviews in case there are others like me that need to know how it will smell when they open the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry and cracked feet and elbows. I use products on them constantly because I know that my skin has this tendency. I am using this oil as a moisturizer for my driest skin  and it is helping them soften. I have several essential oils that I have used this as the carrier oil for. The ones that I have used the most with the coconut carrier oil is my jojoba oil and my lavender oil. But really, any can be used. My husband is in the Navy and has been working some long days. So I surprised him with a back massage and this oil just glided so perfectly and smoothly over his skin. It really helped my arthritic hands not cramp so badly while giving him a back rub. I also like that it felt warming to him and to me and not greasy or sticky like when I use regular lotion on his back. With my Lupus I have noticed that my hair falls out, by the gob full. I often wonder how I have not gone bald yet! But this helps hair grow back healthy and better than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the other label uses for this product, that I have not had the chance to try out are&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as the base for a body scrub&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as a natural deodorant&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as an eye makeup remover&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as a face wash&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as a sunburn remedy&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil as a hair conditioner&lt;br /&gt;-using the oil for cooking&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil has deep penetration for dry damaged skin and it quickly absorbs. The feeling that is left after applying the oil is similar to that of baby oil, only much more light and much more subtle. It will not irritate or dry out the skin it is being used on and it does not feel greasy or sticky even when paired with quality essential oils. If all of this is not good enough reason to try a bottle then maybe knowing you can try it risk free for up to 30 days will sweeten the deal. I absolutely love that about Ommm. If at any point during the first 30 days you find that you do not like any of their products or are dissatisfied with the results there is a cash back, hassle free refund policy.</li>
    <li> Great product. I use it for my essential oils as a carrier oil. No complaints great buy!</li>
    <li> love love love this stuff. Can do just about anything except cook me breakfast!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like how chalky it was and didn&#x27;t really feel like it did anything</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice that it stays in liquid form. Good for removing makeup!</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff!  I&#x27;ve only used coconut oil in the solid form and I like this so much better than what I use coconut oil for.  I was able to get this product at a deep discount in exchange for a review with my honest and unbiased opinion. I use this as a make up remover and it takes off mascara like no other product I&#x27;ve used.  A little bit on a cotton ball and a few swipes, and your good to go.  What I really like is that it is so gentle!  It also removes lip stain with ease.  I really like that it&#x27;s not super greasy like regular coconut oil.  It&#x27;s really light weight and is perfect for an all over moisturizer.  When the oil is fractionated, it take the most essential fatty acids and makes it a really perfect oil for the skin in a light liquid oil.  I also like to apply it to my feet before bedtime with a pair of cotton socks on to keep my feet soft and sandal ready for summer.  If your looking for a really good all over moisturizer and don&#x27;t want the heavy solid coconut oil, then this is the coconut oil for you.  I&#x27;m actually going to research more uses for this product!</li>
    <li> I use coconut oil for EVERYTHING - hair moisturizer, skin moisturizer, oil pulling, make up remover, massages for my grand baby, clear up cradle cap and diaper rash on my grand baby,cooking, making body butter etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I use it so much, I was very interested in fractionated coconut oil. I am very pleased with this product. I tried it out and reread the claims and the claims are spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did was give my grand baby a massage and what I liked is that it quickly absorbed into her skin but didn&#x27;t leave her greasy like the regular coconut oil can. It was smooth gentle and had no smell. That takes me to my next point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made a small sample body butter with other oils for fragrance. Because this oil has no smell there was no cross-aroma. The butter was so smooth and had extremely quick absorption which means I can get dressed immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully the baby&#x27;s cradle cap doesn&#x27;t come back,but if it does I am really interested in trying this on it. The regular coconut oil made her baby fine hair oily - even though it worked like a charm after 2 applications. Since this fractionated oil is not greasy I want to see how well it works. I will update with my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it as a straight moisturizer on my skin and as with the baby and body butter, there was quick absorption that had my skin hydrated without an oily film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a good product and definitely a keeper. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ommm Health and Beauty Products supplied this sample for my review and feedback.</li>
    <li> Got this at a great discount just came today. Excited to use it. Will update with a better review</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, no oily residue and works great</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff! This is my first time using Fractionated Oil and it will not be my last!! I am using it as a moisturizer after I shower and it works incredibly! I have extremely dry and that itches and this is like a miracle cure!&lt;br /&gt;I am also going to try it as a carrier oil for other stronger oils to be mixed with it.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy that I bought this product!!</li>
    <li> No complaints over here; works well as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using regular coconut oil for years, but this fractionated carrier oil is so much easier to use and the results and benefits are better. If your not using coconut oil for your skin and hair you should be. This is the best form of coconut oil you can find.</li>
    <li> This oil is great for moisturizing the skin.  Sad to say, I&#x27;ve tried everything on my scaly shins.  This has greatly improved them!  I would recommend.  I also use to tame down the frizzies on humid days for my hair.  Leaves it feeling silky and looks so shiny and healthy!</li>
    <li> Amazing quality. I used this oil in my homemade hair products. As well as perfect to add with fragrance oil. Skin safe. Very slight odor, not as heavy as other bands I used. Will definitely purchase again. I suggest u should too.</li>
    <li> I love this Coconut Fractionated Carrier Oil, I always have and use coconut oil but decided to try this when I ran out, wow, I&#x27;ll never be without this, it&#x27;s so great for hair, skin, removing makeup, as a carrier oil for my diffuser, the list goes on and on. I just wish it came with a pump.</li>
    <li> A million and one uses!  I have used coconut oil in my hair for nearly 10 years and it is amazing!  It is great for all ethnicity&#x27;s too.  My husband gives great foot massages with this too!  I use it as a body oil after the shower and I have just started doing what is referred to as dental oil pulling, using it as a mouth swish to help whiten teeth, it traps bacteria&#x27;s and toxins in the mouth.  You do have to swish with it for 20 min at least once a day to get results. It works really well for just about anything you could thing of to use it with or on!  I could write endless uses but you need to simply try it for yourself!  The bottle is large and last a long time even using it daily.  I absolutely love coconut oil!</li>
    <li> This carrier oil is great!  It has no fragrance, so it is perfect to use all of your essential oils with.  You can use it with Shea Butter to make lotions - you can use it to diffuse your favorite oils.  The possibilities are endless.</li>
    <li> awesome product, would recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for me and my family to help us with dry skin patches and for hair health. This product is 100% natural and works great  for skin, hair and massage therapy.. This product easily absorbs into the skin. This product has a very long shelf life and also helps preserve other oils.This seller offers a 30 day money back satisfaction. I received this product at a free or reduced price and is my unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> I just started using coconut carrier oil in the past year and it has so many benefits. This is used for massages, hair conditioner, carrier oil for essential oils , moisturizer and any other use we can find for it in our household. I like to use it on my legs after tanning as well. It absorbs really nicely and does not leave greasy feeling either.  I had received this brand &amp;#34;Ommm Health and Beauty Products&amp;#34; at a discount during a promotional offer and I think it is as good as any coconut fractionated carrier oil I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil is a great product for the skin and hair. This product is very effective and great.</li>
    <li> This works great as a cooking oil and moisturizer. Great product at a very good price for the size you get. Also not heavy at all, more like a baby oil consistency.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using fractionated coconut oil and I am very impressed with it!  My only complaint is that it does not smell like coconut, it actually has no scent at all which I guess is a good thing for people with allergies or sensitive skin.  It is not super greasy like most oils and it absorbs into the skin fast.  It leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth and I&#x27;m hoping over time that it will help with wrinkles but it&#x27;s way too soon to tell.  I love that it is a natural product without any chemicals and it has many uses besides being a beauty product.  I have used it as a hair treatment as well,  a very small amount goes a long way, I simply pour a dime size amount into the palm of my hand, rub my hands together to evenly coat my palms then run my hands through my hair but I focus mainly on the dry ends.  It leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.  I&#x27;m excited to test out new uses for this product and I will update my review when I come up with other cool uses for it!&lt;br /&gt;I recieved a discount when I purchased this product in exchange for my honest review, I have not been paid to give this review and the discount that I recieved did not change my opinion of this product.  I would purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Delivery was prompt. Oil is good quality for the price. I use coconut oil for pretty much everything hair moisturizer, teeth whitner, and skin so I love that u get a great size bottle considering I usually pay the price of this bottle for half the size.</li>
    <li> I use this on my face and hair and it is absolutely the BEST!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. When I got it I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and see how well it works against others I have used in the past. Well I used it on my skin to see if it would cure my dry skin and it seems to have made an improvement. My skin dosnt look as ashy and feels great. It is not extremely oily like other oils and a little bit goes along way. I recommend this product to others and think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I mix it with essential oils for a great after-bath moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Using this as a carrier oil for my growth aid for my hair. I also use it right after I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> This is great silky feeling oil.  Feels great with s massage. It has no scent which i like.</li>
    <li> I like that I don&#x27;t have to warm the coconut oil in my hands before using it. Having said that, it&#x27;s a bit messy and it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as the regular coconut oil. I think I&#x27;ll stick to just using it as a carrier oil.</li>
    <li> Love. Has many uses...can be used for hair..cuticles...cooking and as a makeup remover</li>
    <li> I love my coconut oil collection. I use it for so many different things. I received this bottle during a promotion at an amazing price for testing. I am satisfied with the product. It came in a large bottle, and will or should last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil for many different things like an extra conditioner to my hair. I will put a small teaspoon amount in my hand mixing it with my conditioner to give it that added conditioning boost. I love the softness it leaves my hair feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I will also put a couple tablespoons in my mouth and swish it around for 10-15 minutes for the oil pulling ritual I do at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;Oil pulling involves swishing oil around the mouth and has been used for thousands of years as an Indian folk remedy. In order to oil pull, you put a tablespoon of oil in your mouth, then swish it around for 15-20 minutes. The main benefit of doing this, is that it reduces the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I use coconut oil in my lotions, and as a massage oil as well mixing my favorite essential oils with it for an added benefit. This product works well, and as I mentioned above - comes in a large bottle. I am overall happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love this oil. It goes on oily but dries up nice and quick. My skin is left feeling moist, and not ashy anymore. I was given a discount to try this product. I am a big fan and will continue using this.</li>
