      <li>I find it very useful.</li>
      <li>It is the perfect substitute for real tears, and is not otherwise medicated like a lot of other eyedrops are.  </li>
      <li>I have found this product to be the most effective for relief of dry eyes, without blurring.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced no allergic reaction to them (unlike other eye drops)</li>
      <li>After using this product for many years and loving it, I find out that it contains Benzalkonium Chloride as a preservative which has been demonstrated to have extremely adverse effects on corneal cells.</li>
      <li>I have severe dry eye and the reviews on this product were good</li>
      <li>It is the only kind of eye drops that are helpful to me.</li>
      <li>I was just about running out of eye drops , and amazon sent it to me right on target, thanks !!</li>
      <li>Have tried several other brands but this has worked the best.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most of the major brands (up to 2001 while I wore contacts).</li>
      <li>I have used Hypo Tears for many years on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>, why someone is selling it ( with very high price) under the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; of AMAZON??????????????</li>
      <li>Its very soothing for her eyes.  </li>
      <li>Very soothing when applied and also holds up for the day.</li>
      <li>but here.they work really well for him..</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon - no longer have to drive 100 miles to find this product.</li>
      <li>We continue to seek HypoTears as our #1 choice in eye lubricant as we believe it feels more natural and seems longer lasting than others we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>eye doctor recommended them many years ago and several eye doctors I&#x27;ve seen recently</li>
      <li>She highly recommends it.</li>
      <li>highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I am surprised at how much I like these eye drops.</li>
      <li>I use many different drops as none including these work for long.</li>
      <li>Nothing special compared with other eye drops.</li>
      <li>Other drops may work better for severe dry eye</li>
      <li>It gives me the most relief for dry eyes over other products I tried.</li>
      <li>WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE</li>
      <li>I suspect that they were considerably overpriced; in fact I know that they were.  </li>
      <li>Hypotears doesn&#x27;t feel like just saline eyewash, it wets far longer.</li>
      <li>After I became a customer of Amazon, I thought let me give this a look - WOW, there they are.  </li>
      <li>I prefer HypoTears over all other drops I&#x27;ve tried as the others seem to make my eyes feel too gunky/blurry for too long after use, although mostly all of them seem to provide proper lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really did not know what I was going to do without them - as I have dry eye syndrone.  </li>
      <li>My wife uses it and it relieves dry very well!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I have very dry eyes, especially when I first wake up.</li>
      <li>They instantly upon use make my husband&#x27;s eyes clear and stop burning.  </li>
      <li>Apparently I was allergic to the preservative they were using.  </li>
      <li>I have tried so many others in the past with very little benefit.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years for moderate dry eye with no other eye disease.</li>
<li> I use these eye drops regularly for dry eyes at my doctors suggestion.</li>
<li> I have tried numerous other eye drops and went back to these.</li>
<li> but I was not surprised.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and my eyes are never irritated or dry.</li>
<li> and I have been using them for over 25 years since I was told to use drops for dry eye.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m using this product to counter the dry eyes that I wake up with now</li>
<li> I have had severe dry eyes for years.</li>

<li> Tried other products, but none came close to this.</li>

<li> I have found it almost impossible to find Hypo Tears in any of the drug stores or supermarkets in Maine over the past yaer or more.</li>
<li> Hypo Tears keeps my eyes from &amp;#34;tearing up.&amp;#34; Soothes and comforts &amp; makes my eyes less itchy.</li>
<li> I have severely dry eyes and have found at least a little relief with this brand.</li>
<li> I use Hypotears to counteract dry eyes on airplane flights, during the winter, when I am tired, or at bedtime.  </li>
<li> I have never had this problem with Hypotears, so I seek them out, although they are sometimes hard to find.  </li>
<li> Thry were recommended years ago by an opthamologist, and have become hard to find.  </li>

    <li> I prefer HypoTears over all other drops I&#x27;ve tried as the others seem to make my eyes feel too gunky/blurry for too long after use, although mostly all of them seem to provide proper lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried most of the major brands (up to 2001 while I wore contacts). Then I had lasik and continue to use these drops.</li>
    <li> Excellent eye lubricant. Very soothing when applied and also holds up for the day. I have had severe dry eyes for years. Have tried several other brands but this has worked the best.</li>
    <li> I have been using HypoTears for decades and my mother before me. The last time I purchased them they were made by Bausch &amp; Lomb and were $18 for the I oz. bottle, Now they are made by Novartis and cost more than 3 times that amount? Can we all say HIGHWAY ROBBERY!</li>
    <li> Have used Hypo-tears for many years (prescribed by a doctor) for \\&quot;dry-eye\\&quot; condition.  I&#x27;ve experienced no allergic reaction to them (unlike other eye drops) so I&#x27;ve styuck with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sad to find out this was being discontinued. It&#x27;s the best rewetting drops I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years for moderate dry eye with no other eye disease. I am a computer programmer. I have found this product to be the most effective for relief of dry eyes, without blurring. I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypotears isn&#x27;t just saline with an antimicrobial preservative. Polyvinyl alcohol, one of the active ingredients, is a film-forming emulsifier (see Wiki entry). Hypotears doesn&#x27;t feel like just saline eyewash, it wets far longer.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that does not irritate my eyes.  It is expensive but worth it.  Eye doctor recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but, paying 40% more..... Price was right and came in perfectly and on time.</li>
    <li> I was just about running out of eye drops , and amazon sent it to me right on target, thanks !! i will defenitlly keep buying from you guys !only one thing I don&#x27;t like ..it&#x27;s the price ,too expensive !!</li>
    <li> I am surprised at how much I like these eye drops. I have tried so many others in the past with very little benefit. Hypo tears helps me where most others do not. I have severely dry eyes and have found at least a little relief with this brand.</li>
    <li> So why does it cost so much more now?  That isn&#x27;t going to help sales!  I used to get it for $12 and now, suddenly, it&#x27;s $18!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1986.  It is the perfect substitute for real tears, and is not otherwise medicated like a lot of other eyedrops are.  I suggest you get it if you need it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hypo Tears for over 20 years.  They keep my eyes lubricated without burning.&lt;br /&gt;My eye doctor recommended them many years ago and several eye doctors I&#x27;ve seen recently&lt;br /&gt;both for myself and my friend have recommended them.  I don&#x27;t understand why we can&#x27;t get them in the&lt;br /&gt;local stores. I have to order them on line.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this product to counter the dry eyes that I wake up with now that I&#x27;m on glaucoma medication at bedtime (Travatan).  It works -- my eyes feel comfortable all day.</li>
    <li> After using this product for many years and loving it, I find out that it contains Benzalkonium Chloride as a preservative which has been demonstrated to have extremely adverse effects on corneal cells. It is also rather malicious that this product does not list Benzalkonium Chloride as a preservative used.</li>
    <li> We continue to seek HypoTears as our #1 choice in eye lubricant as we believe it feels more natural and seems longer lasting than others we&#x27;ve tried.  We sense this brand to be the highest quality lubricant we&#x27;ve tried, so we&#x27;ve come to trust it time and time, again.  We know others are out there on the market and have even been offered through our eye physicians, but we keep coming back to HypoTears.</li>
    <li> Was not able to find the product locally, so I found it and ordered from Amazon.com.  Received product promptly and everything was as it should be.</li>
    <li> Hypo Tears has always been my favorite lubricant eye drops and I have been using them for over 25 years since I was told to use drops for dry eye.  I have never experienced a problem with them. They are very refreshing and non sticky.  Other drops may work better for severe dry eye but I found other eye doctor recommended brands to be either sticky or hazy or both, and not refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, happy to have been able to purchase them online since I no longer can find them in retail stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I have used Hypo Tears for 30 years or more. It gives me the most relief for dry eyes over other products I tried. I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
    <li> I order this product for a friend.  She couldn&#x27;t find it at the drugstore anymore.  She says its an excellent product.  Its very soothing for her eyes.  She highly recommends it.</li>
    <li> These were for my mother.  She has been buying Hypo Tears for years and is the ONLY brand that work on her eyes.  She has no side-affects from them either.</li>
    <li> ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED… I RECOMMENDED… WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL; QUALITY 95%...</li>
    <li> About 25 years ago, my eye doctor told me to use these drops after RK surgery.  For years I bought them off the shelf at Walmart.  Then all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find them at Walmart OR Walgreens and I really did not know what I was going to do without them - as I have dry eye syndrone.  After I became a customer of Amazon, I thought let me give this a look - WOW, there they are.  I now order 4 or 5 bottles at a time.  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and love them.  I have tried numerous other eye drops and went back to these.</li>
    <li> As always, did just fine</li>
    <li> I have used Hypo Tears for many years on a regular basis. It had been recommended by my eye doctor. It is quite soothing to the eyes.  It is also available in drugstores.  I find it very useful.</li>
    <li> The eye drops are fine.  I suspect that they were considerably overpriced; in fact I know that they were.  I should have done my research before ordering them, not after.</li>
    <li> I had problems with my eyes several years ago and went to the eye dr.  After checking they found I had &#x27;dry eyes&#x27; and this was what she told me to use.  Have been using it ever sense and it works great.</li>
    <li> I ordered these for my mom as she is unable to purchase from Wal-Mart, who have decided not to carry them. She has been told to use them and had difficulty locating them. They work for her and I&#x27;m glad I can get them through Amazon!</li>
    <li> My wife uses it and it relieves dry very well!&lt;br /&gt;This Novartis product, like all its pharmaceutical products are the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I understand they no longer make this</li>
    <li> I use these eye drops regularly for dry eyes at my doctors suggestion. They work fine for me.</li>
    <li> It does what I want it to do without any irritation.  Doctor okays its use.  It is soothing and jeeps my eyelids from stickingI use it for my Dry eye Syndrome.</li>
    <li> I learned from regular hospital pharmacies , that those drops were recalled.I don&#x27;t know the reason.&lt;br /&gt;Then, why someone is selling it ( with very high price) under the &amp;#34;wings&amp;#34; of AMAZON??????????????</li>
    <li> I use Hypotears to counteract dry eyes on airplane flights, during the winter, when I am tired, or at bedtime.  These are not for redness - those types of drops have some chemicals I&#x27;d rather not put into my eyes.  These are simply saline drops, with a preservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some other brands of saline drops, but they made my eyes itch.  Apparently I was allergic to the preservative they were using.  I have never had this problem with Hypotears, so I seek them out, although they are sometimes hard to find.  I recommend them.</li>
    <li> To expensive had to go to something else</li>
    <li> My husband swears by these drops.he can no longer find them anywhere but here.they work really well for him..he uses them 2or3times daily.</li>
    <li> These are the best drops for my eyes and I have recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> Best eyedrops, the only ones that don&#x27;t irritate my eyes. Too bad they&#x27;re not available in stores for a cheaper price.</li>
    <li> These are the best eyedrops for people who wear contacts and/or have dry eyes.  Thry were recommended years ago by an opthamologist, and have become hard to find.  They are expensive, but soothing and non-irritating.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best eyedrops on the market.Ive tried many and this works best for my dry and/or irritated eyes.</li>
    <li> Price on this item is redicul,extremely,expensive. Some one is taken advantages of the person on the ignorance .</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this product has been discontinued. It is the only kind of eye drops that are helpful to me. I am sad to see such high prices for this now and assume the supply will evaporate before long. PLEASE, company who made this product. make this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product for lubricating eyes--especially for contact lens users.  It&#x27;s become very difficult to find in stores. Hope it has not been discontinued.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and my eyes are never irritated or dry.</li>
    <li> I read all the 5 stars review and purchased one but I was not surprised. Nothing special compared with other eye drops. Nothing negative, either</li>
    <li> My WM store no longer carries these eyedrops.  For years and years I have used these eyedrops.  They are the best and the most soothing eyedrops I&#x27;ve ever used.  Thanks Amazon - no longer have to drive 100 miles to find this product.</li>
    <li> These are the best eye drops we have ever found.  They instantly upon use make my husband&#x27;s eyes clear and stop burning.  He has worn contacts since grade school and these are the only drops that give him the relief he needs.</li>
    <li> The is the best of all which was recommended by one of the top doctors of NY Presbyterian Eye Institute.</li>
    <li> I have very dry eyes, especially when I first wake up. I&#x27;ve tried others, but Hypotears are the best by far.</li>
    <li> I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL BRANDS OF EYE PRODUCTS.  HYPO TEARS IS THE ONLY BRAND THAT WORKS FOR ME ,UNFORTUNATELY IT&#x27;S GETTING TOO EXPENSIVE WHICH HURTS IF YOUR ON LIMITED INCOME.</li>
    <li> I have severe dry eye and the reviews on this product were good so I wanted to see how well they would work for me. I use many different drops as none including these work for long. I even have to use drops throughout the night so others may have better luck with these than I do.&lt;br /&gt;I also have allergies to anything with preservatives but these either don&#x27;t have preservatives or I have no problems if they do. Though they may work well for someone else they only help a little for me. I&#x27;ve used better drops and again - that may be just in my case.</li>
    <li> Best eye drops I have ever used. Too bad they are so hard to find and are so expensive!</li>
    <li> I have found it almost impossible to find Hypo Tears in any of the drug stores or supermarkets in Maine over the past yaer or more. So I went on line to find it and glad I did.</li>
    <li> great product and service.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years.  I used to buy it at the drug store and they told me it was being discontinued.  Then I found it at Walmart and they discontinued it.  I was glad I could find it on line.  These are they only eye drops my eyes like.&lt;br /&gt; Please don&#x27;t discontinue carrying it.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, saved me from going to the drug store.  Product was as described.  We have used the hypo tears for several years and they work well.</li>
    <li> Hypo Tears keeps my eyes from &amp;#34;tearing up.&amp;#34; Soothes and comforts &amp; makes my eyes less itchy. It was recommended by my eye doctor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it has always soothed my eyes.  Tried other products, but none came close to this.</li>
</ol>
