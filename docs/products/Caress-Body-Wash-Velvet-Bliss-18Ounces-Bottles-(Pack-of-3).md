<li> I do like this body wash but am a little disappointed by the scent - it is just too subtle, I wanted something that smelled really, really good.</li>
<li> i dont know, but i am confused why isnt these bottles sealed individually to prevent tampering and or spillage(my case,all three were in a sealed bag which helped keep all the body wash in the bag</li>
<li> (3 bottles)within the two day shipping, i gave praise for that, but what i am annoyed at</li>
<li> Sad face.</li>
<li> I just can&#x27;t believe its so expensive.</li>
<li> It is impossible to find in stores.</li>

    <li> This body wash lathers very nicely, and leaves a delicate scent behind. I was expecting a nice smell of blackberry, but for some reason it smells like grapefruit to me.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe they discontinued this.</li>
    <li> i received my caress body wash velvet bliss 18 oz (3 bottles)within the two day shipping, i gave praise for that, but what i am annoyed at is the massive clean up efforts on my end,  i will post a pic of the destruction, what happen? i dont know, but i am confused why isnt these bottles sealed individually to prevent tampering and or spillage(my case,all three were in a sealed bag which helped keep all the body wash in the bag but, now how will i transfer it back in the original bottle unless i cut the corner end of the plastic bag where all the body wash is currently in and act like im iceing a cake (frosting method) squeeze it in and hope all of it fills like normal...see pic</li>
    <li> I ordered the 3 pack of caress velvet bliss for my wife. And when it arrived to me, the body wash was all over the box. Looked very similar to the pic in the other review. Bottles only a third full. There was no salvaging any of the body wash because it was all over the box, all over the bottles. None of them were individually sealed to prevent leakage. Soo much product wasted.</li>
    <li> I like it just what I ordered cost was  within the budget I wanted and I may need more in the future</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. Not too fruity or perfumey. I like it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My second favorite next to cashmere luxury. I just can&#x27;t believe its so expensive. Use to cost like $4 in store. Why do all the good things get discontinued? Sad face.</li>
    <li> This body wash is high on my list very nice clean  scent  bad news the manufacturer stopped production of this product ( I wrote to unilever asking why I could not find it in stores) but I will repurchase from my amazon highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;By me I received my order  intact</li>
    <li> I do like this body wash but am a little disappointed by the scent - it is just too subtle, I wanted something that smelled really, really good.</li>
    <li> This is my partners favorite body wash.  It is impossible to find in stores.  So I was very pleased to find it online.</li>
    <li> It is my first time using this body wash and I like it. It lathers great and the smell is also good.  It does the job and does it well.</li>
    <li> This is my partners favorite body wash. It is impossible to find in stores. So I was very pleased to find it online.</li>
    <li> When I got this item it was partially frozen and all 3 of the bottles had exploded.</li>
    <li> This is such a yummy fragrance and it&#x27;s scent lasts the entire day.  I get compliments every time I shower with it.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me, I have really dry skin...this and Dove are probably the only two products I buy. But it was the great deal that made this purchase for me.</li>
    <li> yes I am loving it. it came packaged really nice and there wasn&#x27;t any spillage like I read on a review that&#x27;s what I was worried about&lt;br /&gt;. thank u very much and i will b ordering again.</li>
