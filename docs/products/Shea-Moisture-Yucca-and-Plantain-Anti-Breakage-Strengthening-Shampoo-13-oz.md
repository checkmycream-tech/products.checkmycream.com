### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I will say that this shampoo, combined with the conditioner, the anti-breakage mask, and the thickening spray, all work wonderfully for about 24 hours out of the shower (after blow-drying, that is).</li>
      <li>how great it works!!!</li>

      <li>all, I am VERY happy with this &amp;#34;Volume&amp;#34; line of products by Shea Moisture, I do agree...</li>
      <li>However, I was expecting the Yucca and Plantain product and received the baobab one instead, but still a great buy!</li>
      <li>Very good.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>

      <li>But that made me even more happy!  </li>
      <li>so finding a product that effectively does this is a must!</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful shampoo, but there are two things you need to be aware of for the best results--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is an excellent shampoo for fine hair, but take a moment to search.</li>
      <li>Shampoo smells good...</li>
      <li>My hair has never looked so good.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser loved the smell and so did I.</li>
      <li>…but that might be good for flyaway hairs!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>The smell of the shampoo is very nice, not too strong or overwhelming....simply pleasant.</li>
      <li>I did not use any conditioner, but this seems more like a leave-in conditioning product than a shampoo!</li>
      <li>This product noticeably gives you more volume - I&#x27;m not exaggerating!</li>
      <li>I do love this brand though!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>

      <li>This is my honest review.</li>
      <li>The positives i liked the smell it does make your hair soft/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Im biracial the whole shea moisture line,works excellent on my hair.</li>
      <li>Just really nice</li>
      <li>No sulfates, alcohol or any chemicals that can do more damage than good.  </li>
      <li>I just saw this kind and decided to try.  </li>
      <li>But I excitedly purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, they DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!    </li>
      <li>: I heard this was a good sulfate free</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a good sulfate free shampoo for awhile now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;PS: While this doesn&#x27;t matter to me the fragrance is unbelievably beautiful and it lasts almost a whole day.</li>
      <li>I also really love the fragrance</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>(But if you expect miracles from your beauty products, then you&#x27;d be better off asking Dr. Oz to recommend a hair care regimen for you :)</li>
      <li>After 14+years of torturing my hair with dyes, it started getting increasingly thinner and more oily.</li>
      <li>Love it.  </li>
      <li>and i&#x27;m pleased with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I thought,  like many others who wrote reviews, that it was leaving residue in my hair.  </li>
      <li>I did though notice more breakage at the top of my head.</li>
      <li>and I wanted it better.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>I was expecting more from this product.</li>
      <li>Overall I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
      <li>If what made the suds more intense was what caused the itching, I am more than happy with the sudsing the product provides.  </li>
      <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
      <li>These products give her hair body and shine and much more volume.  </li>
      <li>As I age i notice that my hair is thinning on top.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo - although sulfate-free, it does lather but does not leave my hair feeling stripped.  </li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended it to most of my friends (they&#x27;ve become converts.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I love the way my hair feels and the thickness and body</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>Ok so I read the reviews.</li>
      <li>I sometimes use the milk and thickening spray, but I love my Aveda curly styling products.</li>
      <li>/&gt;After I washed it with the shampoo I used the Shea Thickening Conditioner and after washing that out my hair, it felt more...</li>
      <li>It is free of a lot of toxins!  </li>
      <li>I don’t get as many flyaway hairs when I braid my hair.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>More if I go one month without my hair after I trim/straighten</li>
      <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE Shea Moisture products.</li>
      <li>All the reviews were pretty good, so I was expecting better.</li>
      <li>lol but still like my hair had natural oils in it which I truly believe hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
      <li>Just like all their other products, I am deeply impressed.</li>
      <li>Exactly as shown on auction, great price, shipping reasonable and on time...will buy from them again!</li>
      <li>This shampoo does not rinse out easily.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Also the odor is really strong.</li>
      <li>However, fine hair can break easily</li>
      <li>I have been very pleased with how this shampoo gently treats my hair, while providing cleanliness and shine.</li>
      <li>I recommended it to my daughter-in-law, who has baby fine hair.  </li>
      <li>I have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, but no longer.  </li>
      <li>Though thinner in appearance, it still works and lathers just as fine.</li>
      <li>I rinsed with very hot water to try and make sure I was rinsing thoroughly, and still had residue.</li>
      <li>, the shampoo works great alone, love this even more with the jbco as it maintains my tightly coiled hair.</li>
      <li>I have a HUGE SM fan.  </li>
      <li>No matter the styling products, I notice a huge difference in volume.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and glossy, and a comb glides through it.  </li>
      <li>you must use this with a light hand or it will weigh your hair</li>
      <li>Fortunately, this product tamed that beast.  </li>
      <li>SM products are available at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Sally Beauty Supply and cost about $11.  </li>
      <li>It still looks nice, but &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; not so much.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After washing with this shampoo, my hair felt more greasy and dirty than before I washed it. It makes my blonde hair look almost a shade darker from the gunk it leaves behind. I have used just the shampoo, no conditioner or products afterwards. My hair feels weighed down. The reason I use volumizing shampoo is because I have a lot of cowlicks and they are easier to handle when my roots are lifted. This shampoo does the opposite. It also makes my scalp itchy. I have tried this 3 times and I will definitely not be using the rest of the bottle. That&#x27;s a bummer because it is a good price for an all natural product. I think it was around $6 at CVS. I was using the Nature&#x27;s Gate volumizing shampoo prior to this and it worked pretty well so I&#x27;ll probably go back to that.</li>
    <li> I like the other Shea Moisture products better.  As other reviewers have noted-- this shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair of natural oils, leaving it feeling and looking unclean, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Well packaged to prevent breaking or leaking.  Works great for fine hair.  Would use product and seller again.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Love it.  I&#x27;ve been using their shampoos and lotions for years now.  I just saw this kind and decided to try.  I have long, thin, but extra curly hair.  I wanted something that could keep the curls moisturized but add some thickness.  Smells amazing and I feel there&#x27;s a little extra oomph to my hair.  No sulfates, alcohol or any chemicals that can do more damage than good.  I&#x27;ve never seen this particular shampoo in the store and for a few more dollars than the other kinds I can get at CVS, Meijer, etc I&#x27;ll get this here and save myself the gas money trying to locate it around town.</li>
    <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
    <li> It does thicken the hair, or appears to, and you only have to wash your hair every 3rd day.</li>
    <li> I was expecting more from this product. But like everything else it didn&#x27;t. It actually did the opposite it was suppose to do. I don&#x27;t like giving bad reviews. But this product did not delivered the goods.</li>
    <li> This shampoo helps maintain the moisture in my hair,although it has not improved the breakage.</li>
    <li> Made my hair greasy and heavy.</li>
    <li> Just like all their other products, I am deeply impressed. Right now I am using the other products under this line ie. Yucca and etc. This shampoo leaves my hair clean and soft. Sometimes I don&#x27;t even condition afterwards. I would definitely recommend this product and their other products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Now you must use this with a light hand or it will weigh your hair down.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.</li>
    <li> I have health issues and as a result I get itchy/dry scalp; only Head and Shoulders helped.  Natural shampoos with tea tree oil were too oily.  I have European thin straight hair, and by noon it would look dirty with the tea tree oil shampoos.  About three weeks ago I found this one, and gave it 3 stars because:&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- It is free of a lot of toxins!  Even gluten, so that helps with my sensitivities.&lt;br /&gt;- My itchy/dry scalp is gone!  Just like Head and Shoulders but without all the toxins.&lt;br /&gt;- I don’t get as many flyaway hairs when I braid my hair.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- At full strength, it is kinda oily.  Less oily than the tea tree oil, but more than regular shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;- At full strength, it feels kinda waxy. …but that might be good for flyaway hairs!&lt;br /&gt;- If I don’t blow dry it and let it dry naturally, it looks dirty.&lt;br /&gt;FIXES:&lt;br /&gt;- If you have thin European straight hair, water it down: 1 Bottle of shampoo to 1 ½  water. I used 1:2 ratio and it was too much water and it would separate.&lt;br /&gt;- Blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe wash your hair every other week with water and baking soda to remove any residue.&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;- This shampoo is NOT for European thin hair or oily hair.  It will look dirty unless you try the fixes.&lt;br /&gt;-  It IS for people that have health issues and are trying to cut down on toxins/gluten; have dry/itchy scalp; or have dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;- Since it has worked on my scalp, I plan to continue to use it but watered down.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: I still like this shampoo very much, And my husband likes it now too. He is a hard one when it comes to natural products, But this stuff works. I think something that sells my husband is that the scent is strong and lingers for a while like synthetic scents do in conventional products, and for him thats something he can&#x27;t let go of in my venture to find gentler more natural products. I still like this product and use it when I am traveling or am not able to use egg yolk to wash my hair. I said in my review last year that I was looking for a more natural product that works for my dandruff prone scalp and unfortunately this shea moisture shampoo didn&#x27;t do the trick afer awhile because I don&#x27;t like shampooing more than every third day. Maybe if I washed every other day or every day it probably would of worked. If egg yolk washes didn&#x27;t work so well I would of proably tried their african black soap shampoo because I like their stuff so much. I have tried their bar soap, body wash, shampoo, and leave in thickening conditioner and i&#x27;m pleased with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After three uses I don&#x27;t know if I feel my hair is thicker yet, but thats also not why I purchased it. I purchased it because the ingredients seemed like they might help my dandruff and I wanted something natural (I haven&#x27;t tried the matching conditioner yet because I have a brand new bottle at the moment, but plan to in the future because I have been on the search for a natural conditioner/shampoo). I was skeptical of this stuff at first because I have been so disappointed by most natural shampoos, they either dry out my hair/scalp or don&#x27;t lather well, it hasn&#x27;t dried my hair/scalp out and it lathers surprisingly well. It could be the biotin, because I have read that biotin applied to the scalp can be an affective treatment for dandruff, or it could be the yucca? So far I love this shampoo and plan to purchase it again when it&#x27;s time. I have also been using kirkland signature conditioner with it(I don&#x27;t know if that makes a difference, but I thought I would put that out there).</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo for my very dry hair and scalp. My only negative here on Amazon is that I can buy this elsewhere for $10.00 or less with free shipping. Crazy pricing here. Get this shampoo, but buy elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I was just looking for another shampoo, so that I can alternate between Head and Shoulder and the new one because I&#x27;ve noticed that Head and Shoulder is not good for my hair. Let me just say this, this product is amazing. Not only does it smell good, but it leaves my hair smelling good and soft. I can run my fingers through my hair, and there wouldn&#x27;t be any tangles. I&#x27;ve also noticed that this shampoo helps moisturize my scalp, which is a plus because I have dandruff problems. The only thing though is that it leaves my hair a bit oily by the end of the day. I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days, and it&#x27;s great. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest getting this from this seller though because you can get them for way cheaper from other online store. You can also go to any drugstores for this. I got mine for a little under 10 dollars.</li>
    <li> may hair is naturally thin, and colored. I&#x27;ve been using other shampoo&#x27;s and started to find out about the chemicals that most contain..I wanted to find a sulfate free shampoo that was also free of other chemicals, and i happened to find this one. Wow... such a small product but how great it works!!! I tried only once and fell in love, when i washed my hair i felt it soft after rinsing the shampoo, other shampoos i would feel like if it was stripping my hair, and would fade away the color of my hair so much faster. But not SheaMoisture!! I immediately bought the conditionar and have other purchases planned out. Love it! Definitely reccommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at Target, not through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I totally agree with other reviewers who say this one is not good for fine, oily hair. It was too heavy for my hair, left it totally flat and made it really greasy. After a few uses I put it away and will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Why is this product so expensive!?! It&#x27;s like half price at Target! I&#x27;m not going to spend almost $30 on shampoo never mind the whole line!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, but no longer.  After trying high end, low end, and everything in between shampoos, moisturizers, and volumizers without any or minimal satisfaction and a dent in the pocket, this shampoo works.  My hair feels thick.  It is smooth and glossy, and a comb glides through it.  On my first use I was a bit skeptical as the shampoo felt greasy and didn&#x27;t lather right away.  Patience!  Just massage it into the hair and there will be lather; heaps of white foamy nice smelling lather, which rinses out easily without leaving any film or residue.  One bottle of shampoo and no moisturziers or volumizers needed.  What a find!</li>
    <li> Very concentrated a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive thickening shampoo.  I received strengthening shampoo.  I assumed the thickening was no longer made, so I am using the one I received.  Let me know if there actually is the thickening shampoo available.  I used it before and like it.</li>
    <li> I am giving this four stars only because I am confused on how to feel about it. My hair is really fine, sleek, shiny, dark brown almost black, with naturally not much of a volume and overall straight with a few flippies here and there at the bottom (type 1a would be my best guess).&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo literally changed the texture making it feel like I put some beach spray in it. It is slightly wavy or rather the strands are more separated, not as shiny but definitely quite voluminous. It reminds me of how it gets when I have been swimming in the ocean. I did not comb or brush it after shampooing and drying, I think that would weight it down and ruin the volume I got going on. The one thing that makes me indecisive about how I feel about it is the greasy and cleansing factor of it. Similar to a few other reviews of people with greasy hair, it does feel like it did not wash out all the oil from my hair, which I dislike. This is not affecting the volume of my hair overall, but the roots at the base are not lifted that much. There is the illusion of volume and thickness because the rest of the hair is bigger overall but it feels unclean or as if I put product in it. This is definitely something that just bothers me mentally, because my hair really does look great right now and it does look clean, it just doesn&#x27;t FEEL clean in the root area.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product but I would emphasize on the ingredients meant to repair/thicken hair rather than clean it really well (for this purpose, I would recommend Shea Moisture deep cleansing shampoo). I would be careful if you have oily hair.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I love the way my hair feels and the thickness and body the shampoo gives and its all natural. Used in combination with the thickening spray it creates beautiful thick soft hair!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I can use this without anything else and my hair is very soft. However, I was expecting the Yucca and Plantain product and received the baobab one instead, but still a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo - although sulfate-free, it does lather but does not leave my hair feeling stripped.  I usually  massage a little onto my scalp then add water and allow the lather to run down my hair; after rinsing my hair &amp; scalp feel clean and my hair feels soft and moisturized.  I also really love the fragrance - it&#x27;s a sweet, earthy floral scent that lingers a bit after rinsing.  I can&#x27;t say whether it&#x27;s had a &#x27;thickening&#x27; effect but it does a great job of cleansing my hair &amp; scalp and another huge positive is the fact that I can find it on the ground and usually on sale.</li>
    <li> This shampoo does what it claims.  I recommended it to my daughter-in-law, who has baby fine hair.  I use several SM products and love them so I figured this formula might help thicken her thin, lifeless strands.  It definitely worked.  She used it several times and I noticed that she was having successively good hair days.  She also uses the SM Yucca Strengthening conditioner and the Yucca thickening/volumizing mist.  These products give her hair body and shine and much more volume.  Although her hair is fine, she has a lot of it and these products give her hair new life.  They definitely thicken and she had great volume that lasted all day.  I suggest trying these three products in conjunction.  She applies the conditioner just to the midlengths and ends of her hair and then rinses really well.  If you have really fine hair, then the conditioner may not be necessary.  However, fine hair can break easily so the strengthening conditioner may help with this issue.  All in all, these SM products definitely do what they claim.  I have a HUGE SM fan.  I use the Manuka Honey s/c/mask/serum which makes my dry, frizz prone hair soft and shiny.  I also love the SM Jamaican Black Castor Oil clarifying shampoo with apple cider vinegar.  It removes all traces of sticky styling products and hairspray and leaves my hair clean and bouncy.  It also smells really clean and fresh.  SM products are available at Target, Walgreens, CVS, Ulta and Sally Beauty Supply and cost about $11.  But only Target has the Manuka Honey formula (for some strange reason).  SM products are sulfate, silicone, paraben and cruelty free.  What more could you ask for?  I&#x27;m a total SM convert.  My hair has never looked so good.  I highly recommend all the SM products I&#x27;ve mentioned, especially this Yucca and Baobab Thickening shampoo.  It definitely works well for my DIL.</li>
    <li> Does more than I expected</li>
    <li> I bought this at ulta because I needed a new shampoo that helped my dry and flat frizzy hair. I recommend you lather it up in your hands first before applying it to your hair so you get a nice lather. Normally I use a conditioner after I shampoo but I didn&#x27;t need to ! My hair felt soft and it def looked like it had more volume to it. It leaves a nice subtle scent in your hair afterwards, it&#x27;s very earthy and clean- but some might not like it. Overall I&#x27;m impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> My hair feels thicker.  I love the scent of this shampoo, too!</li>
    <li> After seeing all the rave reviews for the other Shea Moisture shampoo, I decided to give this a try. I use this brand&#x27;s lotion faithfully so it wasn&#x27;t too much of a risk to try their shampoo. I&#x27;ve been searching for a good sulfate free shampoo for awhile now. And after a disappointing experience with a John Masters Organics shampoo, I was a bit hesitant to try this. But I excitedly purchased both the shampoo and conditioner and let me tell you, they DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!    The smell of the shampoo is very nice, not too strong or overwhelming....simply pleasant. It also lathers up very nicely and actually a little more than the John Masters Organics (sorry if i&#x27;m making an unintended comparison but it was the only other organic shampoo I tried) which I found surprising, considering it contains less ingredients. But that made me even more happy!  I do have very fine and thin hair so I&#x27;m always on the search for a volumizing (thickening) product. And it does just that. My hair was left feeling soft, smooth, bouncy, moisturized and in pure heaven! In addition to the volume, one thing I particularly like is that it moisturizes. My scalp is naturally dry so finding a product that effectively does this is a must! After using the other shampoo, upon rinsing, my hair felt stripped.  I don&#x27;t know if this is because of an ingredient used or the simple make-up, but when I used this, it was not the case. The conditioner is awesome as well. I&#x27;m so thrilled to finally have found a product that works, is truly organic and is beneficial for my hair. I will definitely be buying this in loads and will most likely use from here on out :)</li>
    <li> I love Shea Moisture products and thought I would try this one, it made my hair greasy, so I am switching back to my favorite Shea Moisture shampoo.</li>
    <li> Some people say this makes their hair greasy. I have naturally oily hair but I only use a tiny amount, I think that is the key to avoiding the grease! A little goes a long way and you only need to wash your roots! Also it&#x27;s easier to lather it up BEfore you put it in your hair. I actually found it easier to rinse out than my garnier fructis or head and shoulders. Smells wonderful and one of few actually all natural products!!! Definitely recommend. Got mine at walgreens shampoo and conditioner for $16.</li>
    <li> Actually too heavy for my fine hair.  I do love this brand though!</li>
    <li> Very good. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Shea moisture yucca &amp; boaboa thickening shampoo is a rich blend. I like the way my Hair feel after I shampoo.</li>
    <li> This is my honest review.I have used this for about a week. I wanted something more natural and sulfate free.I heard that using sulfate products would make your hair shed. I really wanted to like it. The positives i liked the smell it does make your hair soft/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the negatives I have Auburn hair: I heard this was a good sulfate free shampoo(Who the shampoo is geared too makes no difference to me) I read all the reviews from many, many places and none said it was only geared to a particular hair type.Everything it had on the bottle I wanted to prevent/Well It made my hair more frizzy, more breakage,left white residue  and I am extremely unhappy.No difference in the shedding whatsoever I did though notice more breakage at the top of my head. By the way if U do want this product buy it is at target way cheaper and they had it buy one get one 50% off last week. For the price it didn&#x27;t do what it stated to my hair.It made it worse and I wanted it better.I do use a humidifier in my house cause I do know the winter already dries your hair  out anyway. This is my opinion and it might work toward your hair.I have med-auburn hair and it did&#x27;t work for me. I do my research before I buy a product so I had literally read pages of reviews about it before I bought it.</li>
    <li> This left my hair feeling dirty. It did give my hair volume but it felt grungy.  Also the odor is really strong.</li>
    <li> They have changed their ingredients, It is now laced with chemicals, Such a  bummer!!  Water, Decyl Glucoside, Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate, Glycol Stearate, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Panthenol, Stearamide AMP, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter*, Adansonia Digitata Seed Oil, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Fragrance (Essential Oil Blend), Yucca Brevifolia Root Extract, Coriandrum Sativum (Coriander) Extract, Plantain (Musa Paradisiaca) Extract, Hydrolyzed Rice Protein, Glycerin (Vegetable), Caprylhydroxamic Acid, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell at all... However it leaves my hair softer and with less knots than others shampoos. It didn&#x27;t help me with the breakage, so I&#x27;ll switch to another brand.</li>
    <li> Good for thin, fine hair.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. Smells great, great ingredients and leaves hair smooth as butter and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> I tried this shampoo for 4 days in a row. Gross. My hair was so greasy by the 4th day I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. I did not use any conditioner, but this seems more like a leave-in conditioning product than a shampoo! I have oily hair naturally, but I don&#x27;t need to use a product for oily hair. Regardless of what I use, as long as I wash my hair every 24 hours it never looks greasy at all. This shampoo does not rinse out easily. I have fine hair. I have never had a problem rinsing a product from my hair. This stuff did not make my hair feel any thicker either. All the reviews were pretty good, so I was expecting better. I&#x27;m really disappointed. It had a pleasant smell; that&#x27;s the only positive experience I had with this product. It seems to work well for others. I wish I could say the same.</li>
    <li> As of 4/22/15 - The caption on the Amazon page still says &#x27;Shea Moisture Yucca &amp; Baobab Thickening Shampoo.&#x27;  But the manufacturer has discontinued this product.  The new one (and the photo now used on the Amazon page) shows &#x27;Yucca and Plantain.&#x27;  IT IS NOT THE SAME PRODUCT as the one with Baobob.  And does not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other ingredients now being used are also very different from the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea - PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon - PLEASE FIX THE ERROR ON THE PAGE</li>
    <li> Came quicker than I thought and is doing what it&#x27;s said to do so far. I like it so far and will eventually give an updated review.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser loved the smell and so did I. I just started using it and I cant wait to see the results from using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that the fragrance was so strong I was not able to use it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like it because it leaves a residue on my hair.  It may not on other people, or they may not notice it, but I have thin and fine hair, so I notice it.  I rinsed with very hot water to try and make sure I was rinsing thoroughly, and still had residue.</li>
    <li> Exactly as shown on auction, great price, shipping reasonable and on time...will buy from them again! A+</li>
    <li> Love the smell. After using it for about a month I definitely notice the volume it gives my hair but it also leaves a residue behind that I&#x27;m still getting used to. I feel that the residue speeds up the oil build up and I personally don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday. I noticed baby hairs but still not convinced that it&#x27;s more than normal or the correlation between the shampoo and hair growth/thickening. It also feels . I like that it is a gentle shampoo (not too foamy) as well.</li>
    <li> Im biracial the whole shea moisture line,works excellent on my hair.It doesnt strip my hair ,the yucca left my hair thick with volume, and my hair has been growing.i also use the curl smoothie with the growth milk.</li>
    <li> Ok so I read the reviews. First I would like to let people know that I have been a Pantene volume shampoo user for a while and have used EVERY type of hair regrowth, volumizing shampoo on the market before that because my hair has thinned considerably since my twenties. Why? Could be a hormone imbalance, could be shampoos could be diet...after all my research who knows. So, finally I thought why not get with a shampoo that is completely or almost completely natural? Less chemicals and such must be better right?&lt;br /&gt;I have tried ALOT of organic shampoos in the past and yes, they lather less and left my hair feeling dirty...whether my hair was left truly dirty or not by those products I have no idea. I read that a lot of today&#x27;s regular shampoos strip the hair of its natural moisture and that is what I grew up using so THAT&#x27;S how I thought my hair should feel after washing it. After using this product my hair didn&#x27;t feel like it did after I washed with Pantene, that &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; feeling but it did feel &amp;#34;moisturized&amp;#34; like it contains some kind of oil in the product that was left on my hair but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After I washed it with the shampoo I used the Shea Thickening Conditioner and after washing that out my hair, it felt more...&amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34;? lol but still like my hair had natural oils in it which I truly believe hair needs.&lt;br /&gt;After that I towel dried and sprayed on the volume spray they offer with this line. Now I was VERY skeptical using a spray instead of some kind of foamy mousse given my hair&#x27;s thin texture now but WHOA! After I blow dried I my boyfriend was like &amp;#34;WOW, you look like you just got out of a salon....so maybe there is something to this organic hair care kick.&amp;#34; My hair is silky but voluminous and looks amazingly healthy after just one use and without the need to go crazy with blow drying with a huge round brush to smooth it out. After the Pantene it looked....dry so I would use a huge round brush AFTER flipping my head over and drying that way first. It also bumps up the color in my natural dark brown hair. I mention this because I don&#x27;t know how it will effect a blonde or those with red hair.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I am VERY happy with this &amp;#34;Volume&amp;#34; line of products by Shea Moisture, I do agree...don&#x27;t by it here on Amazon, go to Harmon&#x27;s or a store near you where you will find it much more cost effective. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;PS: While this doesn&#x27;t matter to me the fragrance is unbelievably beautiful and it lasts almost a whole day.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any volumizing, but it moisturizes and smells nice. I&#x27;m black with 4b/c hair, shoulder length &amp; natural. A little goes a long way, has a nice lather and I add jbco (castor oil) to it just because I have extra dry hair, the shampoo works great alone, love this even more with the jbco as it maintains my tightly coiled hair. I wash every 2 weeks so a bottle lasts me at least a few months. More if I go one month without my hair after I trim/straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time goes on, the consistency gets thinner...which I take as proof of natural ingredients and yes they do settle so always shake well. Though thinner in appearance, it still works and lathers just as fine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE Shea Moisture products. After heavily researching lotions, I realized there are not many beauty products that you can read the label and know what&#x27;s in your products. Well...Shea Moisture is different. You can read the label and understand what you&#x27;re putting on your body. Also, the product is great! I have very thin, 3A/B curly hair. I have a hard time with volume around my crown. This product noticeably gives you more volume - I&#x27;m not exaggerating! After the first wash, you notice it. I alternate the Thickening shampoo and conditioner with the Shea Moisture moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. I sometimes use the milk and thickening spray, but I love my Aveda curly styling products. No matter the styling products, I notice a huge difference in volume. It&#x27;s great. I&#x27;ve already recommended it to most of my friends (they&#x27;ve become converts. I have a friend with short, thin straight hair who loves it and notices a difference). We purchased some for my mom (who knows nothing about hair products) but has also reported a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a test run. I think you&#x27;ll be happily surprised.</li>
    <li> I love the look of thick, volumouse hair, and this shampoo definitely does the job of giving your hair more volume! However, I wear straight styles and after using this shampoo, straightening my hair on my own becomes nearly impossible! It&#x27;s impossible for my flat iron to give me that sleek, straight look with this shampoo no matter what kind of Argan oil or any other straightening oil I use. So what I end having to do is to just wait it out. Wait a few days for the shampoo to wear off a little so I can get the straight look I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has medium thickness, so I won&#x27;t be using this shampoo for every single wash. Maybe once every two washes. So this product does what it says, but I can&#x27;t style my hair with it!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful shampoo, but there are two things you need to be aware of for the best results--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Use a clarifying shampoo before you try this product. You won&#x27;t be able to tell how a new shampoo affects your hair if the residue of the old stuff is still there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Give this shampoo about a week before you make a call. If you&#x27;re switching from a harsher commercial shampoo, your scalp is accustomed to having its natural oils regularly stripped away (and is therefore is producing more oils than needed in order to compensate). This Shea Moisture shampoo is far gentler on your hair; therefore, when you switch to this, you&#x27;ll have a short period where your scalp is continuing to overproduce oils, but your new shampoo isn&#x27;t ripping them all away (and thus your hair will be somewhat oily). This is temporary -- your scalp will adjust; it just needs a week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first few uses of this shampoo, my hair felt a little too oily/greasy for comfort, and I wondered if I had purchased a bad product. I suspected, however, that this was because my scalp was continuing to produce extra oils. Now, a couple weeks after I began use, my hair feels GREAT. It&#x27;s soft and healthy and much less oily feeling than before. This is a wonderful shampoo; it&#x27;s not badly priced, considering how much product you&#x27;re given for your money, it&#x27;s almost completely natural/organic, and it&#x27;s gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> After 14+years of torturing my hair with dyes, it started getting increasingly thinner and more oily. At the same time, I decided I would no longer buy any product (household or beauty) that was tested on animals. I decided to try DIY shampoos/conditioners at home but I got really tired of making my shampoo and decided to try this line because it was so natural, organic and blessedly cheap (compared to similar brands). I will say that this shampoo, combined with the conditioner, the anti-breakage mask, and the thickening spray, all work wonderfully for about 24 hours out of the shower (after blow-drying, that is). But my hair inevitably goes limp on the second day. It still looks nice, but &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; not so much. (But if you expect miracles from your beauty products, then you&#x27;d be better off asking Dr. Oz to recommend a hair care regimen for you :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I absolutely adore the entire SheaMoisture line and I wish every beauty product manufacturer refrained from animal testing and used such eminently pronounceable, limited, natural ingredients at such a reasonable price. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> First time user.  I have curly, fine hair which i color on occasion and am currently wearing in a short pixie type style. As I age i notice that my hair is thinning on top. Immediately noticed a difference. It felt soft and luxurious. When my hair air dried it had a nice sheen, was very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I also used their conditioner. I am almost 60 years old and my hair has endured many treatments, colors, styles. I was impressed with the results; curls were pretty, nice, shinny ringlets.</li>
    <li> I am white and use this to give my super fine, super thick, super oily hair volume!  It works great and smells great.  It is more difficult to rinse than regular shampoo because of the ingredients and moisture it adds, but I always rinse twice, once right after I shampoo and once again before getting out of the shower because of my thick hair.  I don&#x27;t use conditioner with this or any shampoo.  This also smells great!  My sister and her kids also use it!  What a way to slide into slumber with great smelling hair!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shampoo for fine hair, but take a moment to search. You can buy this at most corner stores for $4-$5 bucks and find it anywhere online for half this price. This listing is a ripoff.</li>
    <li> Nice product, yet I expected a more intense fragrance of Shea for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this product because I was having a terrible problem with scalp itch.  Fortunately, this product tamed that beast.  Takes a little getting used to, as the sudsing is less than what I was used to.  If what made the suds more intense was what caused the itching, I am more than happy with the sudsing the product provides.  Now I am used to the product, I don&#x27;t notice problems with sudsing.  I have been very pleased with how this shampoo gently treats my hair, while providing cleanliness and shine.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product.  I have very fine, thin straight hair. I have tried so many volumizing products in many price ranges...pretty much any poduct I came across that I thought might add some volume and thickness. This line I will be sticking with! Nothing had made my hair thicker,  fuller or stronger like this line. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my hair regularly since I&#x27;ve started using this product line. I&#x27;m sold!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to comment on the reviews regarding residue...when I first started using the shampoo and conditioner I thought,  like many others who wrote reviews, that it was leaving residue in my hair.  By the end of the day my hair was quite greasy. It took me a little bit to realize that I wasn&#x27;t rinsing it out enough.  I had treated it like every other shampoo I&#x27;ve used.  However,  this shampoo has a different,  almost slippery texture.  When you rinse it out,  you REALLY have to rinse it out.  When I started taking my fingers and combing them through my hair and lifting up sections of hair at the roots as I rinsed, everything changed.  No more greasy/residue at the end of the day.  Just really nice volume!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I HIGHLY recommend this line (from the shampoo &amp; conditioner, to the thickening moisture mist). Just be sure to rinse it it well!</li>
    <li> As soon as started shampooing my hair I immediately felt the hair soften and untangling. Shampoo smells good... love it.</li>
