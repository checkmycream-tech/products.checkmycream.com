      <li>I love looking for fragrant bar soaps that are exotic and alluring but didn&#x27;t know which scents were the best scents for me.</li>
      <li>I have purchased these soaps on more than one occasion as gifts and everyone loves them!</li>
      <li>Opening the package there were a tall stack of beautiful soaps gorgeously wrapped and stacked inside a pretty drawstring bag too!  </li>
      <li>They also make my luggage smell nice when I arrive.  </li>
      <li>I ordered them as a gift and my friend who received them really liked them.</li>
      <li>Arrived in good condition and contained in a cute bag.</li>
      <li>It is very beautiful and my friend love it very much.</li>
      <li>These soaps have a strong pleasant smell that lasts.</li>
      <li>The scents are nice and the presentation is lovely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of soaps</li>
      <li>presentation, love it</li>
      <li>I love these soaps.</li>
      <li>These soaps are SO over the top smelly.</li>
      <li>Treat yourself because you&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
      <li>The floras are wonderful too, I personally prefer the fresh mint!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t realize these were not glycerin until they came, but I loved the fragrences so much</li>
      <li>Bought a pack to give away to gift for the holidays and loved them so much I had to order a pack for myself.</li>
      <li>It made showering more exciting and interesting.</li>
      <li>These soaps have such a beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>These soaps are very high quality, all-natural and have amazing aromas.</li>
      <li>They last for over 5 showers in a hotel room and smell great.  </li>
      <li>If you want to pamper yourself or give someone a special treat that they may not buy for themselves then these soaps are fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It sure was a nice change to our mornings and is a nice little luxury.</li>
      <li>And the packaging looks beautiful and professional - the entire set would be a great gift overall to a friend/family.  </li>
      <li>but the scents are varied, some smelling like bubble gum, some more muted with other \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; scents that make them more sophistocated or elegant but not the all-powerful aromatic exotic PURE hawaiian plumeria and tuberose scents of maui tropical soaps.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed about these soaps was how strong the scents are.</li>
      <li>Oh it makes great lather and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that are in other soaps.</li>
      <li>The soaps were very fragrant and unique.</li>
      <li>Each of them are differently fragranced and are wrapped differently as well, making them great gifts and also are quite useful as guest soaps.</li>
      <li>The packaging is pretty and the scents are distinct from one another.  </li>
      <li>They smell so good and fragrence the bathroom and subtly leaves a light remembrance on your hands.</li>
      <li>Love the different fragrances.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want to end up with large bars of soap with scents I didn&#x27;t really care for.</li>
      <li>and she appreciated the gift.  </li>
      <li>I find all of the smells to be authentic and just as they are in nature, not chemically based, like a lot of other soaps.</li>
      <li>They make nice little gifts for Birthdays or at Christmas time!</li>
      <li>So, this is not a con for me and indicative of a higher -quality, all natural product.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like that old commercial with Calgon, for those old enough to remember:)  </li>
      <li>They were smaller than expected and work better as a hand soap.  </li>
      <li>so please be aware that if you want your soaps to last for the longest time, then you have to not let your soapbars soak in any water after the shower.  </li>
      <li>Got this for my significant other and she couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
      <li>I would not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I had meant to order glycerin soap because of my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Will not purchase again as I prefer a more subtle scented soap.  </li>
      <li>Nearly all the different soap bars are breathlessly intoxicating!!  </li>
      <li>I was surprised that they are not full size bars and more like small hand soap bars.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a little scent of home when in foreign countries in foreign hotels.  </li>
      <li>They do disintegrate quickly, if you don&#x27;t keep them elevated out of the water; like most all-natural glycerine base soaps tend to do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The soaps were very fragrant and unique. It made showering more exciting and interesting. It sure was a nice change to our mornings and is a nice little luxury. Be aware that each soap bar is very small such as you would get at a hotel.</li>
    <li> These smalls soaps smell great.  They were smaller than expected and work better as a hand soap.  But lather up so well they can be used in the shower as well.  Great for gift giving.</li>
    <li> They were larger than expected and they arrived on time.  I like the Hawaiian Tropical soaps. Arrived in good condition and contained in a cute bag.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about these soaps was how strong the scents are. The scents are nice and the presentation is lovely but I have sensitive skin and they are a bit overpowering. I read the other reviews so I knew the individual soaps would be small. I would not buy these again. I would not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my sister as a birthday gift since she loves Hawaii and she appreciated the gift.  I was surprised that they are not full size bars and more like small hand soap bars.</li>
    <li> These soaps are very high quality, all-natural and have amazing aromas. I find all of the smells to be authentic and just as they are in nature, not chemically based, like a lot of other soaps. They do disintegrate quickly, if you don&#x27;t keep them elevated out of the water; like most all-natural glycerine base soaps tend to do. So, this is not a con for me and indicative of a higher -quality, all natural product. The smell lingers on my skin and smells great!!</li>
    <li> The bars were a little bit smaller than I expected.  Love the different fragrances. It&#x27;s like that old commercial with Calgon, for those old enough to remember:)  While you are using these bars it&#x27;s like a few moments of escape from your daily hassels of the day.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love looking for fragrant bar soaps that are exotic and alluring but didn&#x27;t know which scents were the best scents for me. I didn&#x27;t want to end up with large bars of soap with scents I didn&#x27;t really care for. This multiple sample assortment allowed me to find the scent I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But be warned that these are only SMALL SAMPLE SIZES!!  If you want the regular sized bars, buy their 5-oz size bars (3 pack).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY loved the plumeria and tuberose and night blooming jasmine and hana ginger scents!!! It made me hunt for those scents in the largest bars for myself. Nearly all the different soap bars are breathlessly intoxicating!!  I&#x27;ve bought plumeria and tuberose soaps online from other sellers from the mainland but the scents are varied, some smelling like bubble gum, some more muted with other \\&quot;powdery\\&quot; scents that make them more sophistocated or elegant but not the all-powerful aromatic exotic PURE hawaiian plumeria and tuberose scents of maui tropical soaps. They&#x27;re all great scents so if you don&#x27;t like any, you could always \\&quot;give\\&quot; the ones you don&#x27;t want as \\&quot;little gifts\\&quot; to your friends/family. And the packaging looks beautiful and professional - the entire set would be a great gift overall to a friend/family.  I&#x27;ve tried many kinds of soaps so please be aware that if you want your soaps to last for the longest time, then you have to not let your soapbars soak in any water after the shower.  Buy a soapcontainer with holes on the bottom so the water can be taken out.</li>
    <li> These soaps have such a beautiful scent. Each of them are differently fragranced and are wrapped differently as well, making them great gifts and also are quite useful as guest soaps. These soaps will definitely impress your guests and friends. Beautiful Hawaiian soaps!</li>
    <li> I have purchased these soaps on more than one occasion as gifts and everyone loves them! The variety and quality is great!</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift .......Maui Tropical Soaps Traditional Hawaiin Soap 8 Bar Gift Bag, 12-ounce.....they liked them and I would buy them again!~Come in a nice gift wrapped bag!~</li>
    <li> These soaps smell heavenly and are brightly colored. They are perfect guest soap size and are also perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> Got this for my significant other and she couldn&#x27;t be happier. The packaging is great, the soap smells fantastic, and the price is perfect. Great gift for any lady!</li>
    <li> These soaps have a strong pleasant smell that lasts. I love the mint, I walk into the bathroom and it smells great! I use these for the guest bathroom. I Leave the wrappers on so the guest gets to open the soap like a little present. I have to look into purchasing the mint in a larger bar for me. The floras are wonderful too, I personally prefer the fresh mint! Oh it makes great lather and doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that are in other soaps.</li>
    <li> I ordered them as a gift and my friend who received them really liked them. However they are a lot smaller than they look in the picture.</li>
    <li> Overpowering scent.  Unpleasant.  Will not purchase again as I prefer a more subtle scented soap.  A few bars were acceptable.</li>
    <li> Nice and fragrant soaps for a good price!  They make nice little gifts for Birthdays or at Christmas time! Recommend these soaps.</li>
    <li> I love these soaps. They smell so good and fragrence the bathroom and subtly leaves a light remembrance on your hands. The little additions to the bars help in cleansing. I had meant to order glycerin soap because of my sensitive skin. I didn&#x27;t realize these were not glycerin until they came, but I loved the fragrences so much I thought I&#x27;d give them a try and they&#x27;ve been quite marvelous. And they have not irritated my skin in any way.</li>
    <li> These soaps are SO over the top smelly. Think of a gardenia bush and then times that by 1000. I tried to give them away to my coworkers and they didn&#x27;t even want them.</li>
    <li> I brought it as my friend&#x27;s birthday present. It is very beautiful and my friend love it very much. I am really happy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews were people say these soaps are small.  Yes they are but they are PREMIUM soaps not the generic soap you buy at the local market.  If you want to pamper yourself or give someone a special treat that they may not buy for themselves then these soaps are fabulous.  Opening the package there were a tall stack of beautiful soaps gorgeously wrapped and stacked inside a pretty drawstring bag too!  I love them and they do make your skin smell delicious.  Treat yourself because you&#x27;re worth it!!</li>
    <li> My husband bought these (and other products) from this soapmaker. Opening each one is a delectable and heady experience.  I have breakout-prone combination skin, yet find they do not make it oily.  For dry hands, they are a blessing and a balm.  One drawback is the pricetag.  I am hoping to buy a set or two for my girlfriend shortly.</li>
    <li> Bought 3 as gifts, took a month+ to receive&lt;br /&gt;Nice presentation, love it but the smell was missing&lt;br /&gt;Thought it would have a stronger tropical scent that&#x27;s why 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t hear back from anyone I gave them to about usage</li>
    <li> I use these soaps when I travel.  They last for over 5 showers in a hotel room and smell great.  It&#x27;s nice to have a little scent of home when in foreign countries in foreign hotels.  They also make my luggage smell nice when I arrive.  I have given them to other travelers as gifts.  The packaging is pretty and the scents are distinct from one another.  These are very small bars  The size you might get when you check into a hotel room.</li>
    <li> Bought a pack to give away to gift for the holidays and loved them so much I had to order a pack for myself. The one complaint I have is that it didn&#x27;t come with 8 different soaps but come with 2 sets of 4 different soaps.</li>
