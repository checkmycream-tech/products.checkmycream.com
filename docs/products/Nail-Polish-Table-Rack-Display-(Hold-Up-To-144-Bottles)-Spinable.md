      <li>I opened the box and it was very nicely packaged and not damaged when i took it out.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect and so cute on my end table.</li>
      <li>With the amount of time I play with my polishes, even if just looking at them, that&#x27;s going to be a lot of spinning :-p  </li>
      <li>It spins with ease and I absolutely loved organizing all of my polishes into it.</li>
      <li>Good thing is that she didn&#x27;t notice that is like that.</li>
      <li>but it does seem to be of good quality</li>
      <li>I gave this nail polish rack a perfect score because it&#x27;s the perfect size for my enormous nail polish collection.</li>
      <li>Also I&#x27;m so happy to be able to use the inside for storage.  </li>
      <li>This was a very worthwhile purchase.  </li>
      <li>im very pleased.</li>
      <li>Now she can go shopping for more finger nail polish!</li>
      <li>The BEST most accessible way to view your nail polish that I have found.  </li>
      <li>love it!</li>
      <li>This rotating nail polish stand is amazing.</li>
      <li>It spins nicely and feels like it would hold up to some years of abuse.  </li>
      <li>Probably will be a good idea to balance out the polish on all 4 sides, spread top to bottom to keep it level for the turn table.  </li>
      <li>it was a great price for the amount of bottles it could fit and fancy with the sign on top.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly, very good looking, extremely practical and useful, wish I had seen it before I did, would make an excellent gift.</li>
      <li>so I could fit more polishes!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t counted how many bottles I have on it</li>
      <li>i wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to look when i got it from the picture</li>
      <li>I am in love with this display case.  </li>
      <li>It reads that it holds up to 144 bottles and I was able to accommodate 151 bottles.</li>
      <li>Mine are separated by shade and I swatch them to be sure I don&#x27;t order anything close.  </li>
      <li>I just love it.</li>
      <li>The sign at the top comes off and I have cotton balls, cotton swabs, remover, files and nail decals stored inside.  </li>
      <li>I love my rack.</li>
      <li>and I had more tha 100 nail polish needing a place to hold them.</li>
      <li>and overall I am a very happy receiver of this thoughtful gift!</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Overall, it is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>moPBFCME0FZSS0]]I love this rack.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish rack.</li>
      <li>it is more made for salon use but it could fit well in any home for anyone who loves nail art and has a lot of polish!</li>
      <li>We were even able to place our shellac and vinylux bottles on it (they fit sideways).  </li>
      <li>Even the tall ones can fit on the top shelf.  </li>
      <li>i was so happy i received it early.</li>
      <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it the full 5 stars is because of the crack, otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
      <li>Depending on the size of the bottles, I can turn them sideways and fit more on a row.  </li>
      <li>Most polish brands fit easily in the slots.</li>
      <li>It makes picking out colors easy.  </li>
      <li>and you will be fine</li>
      <li>Either way it&#x27;s awesome but be aware it&#x27;s fragile to ship.  </li>
      <li>but it was fine.</li>
      <li>I kept the polish in a drawer which worked fine until I noticed I had started buying duplicates.  </li>
      <li>Already filled it up, thinking of getting another.</li>
      <li>This one holds all of them and rotates smoothly.</li>
      <li>Mine fits inside a built in cabinet to protect it from the sun and keep the room free of clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I just love this rack, I&#x27;m able to put all my favorite polishes and see everything in a single turn.</li>
      <li>people who have large collections use Helmers, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of not being able to see what you have.  </li>
      <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose well and provides a professional &amp; unique look to anyone with a large nail polish collection that wants their collection beautifully displayed.  </li>
      <li>It looks very professional with the cute sign on top and it is very very sturdy on the table.</li>
      <li>For me it&#x27;s just the right size to put on my desk &amp; fit all of my nail polish on.</li>
      <li>insta dry, crackle polish, elf, milani, ciate, and some tiny bottles all fit perfectly.</li>
      <li>Super gluing</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this polish rack, it fits nicely on my bathroom counter and suprisingly doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
      <li>Other than having to find a different space in the salon to place it is perfect.</li>
      <li>You can also turn the side on top upside down and stack on top of it.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
      <li>The rack is pretty</li>
      <li>i thought i heard a crack on mine at first</li>
      <li>Now I can see exactly what colors I have.  </li>
      <li>Only wish it held more nail polish bottles.</li>
      <li>I received this on the first day of its estimated shipment which was jan 16th-22nd.</li>
      <li>My nail polish bottles look so pretty</li>
      <li>It is so pretty.  </li>
      <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
      <li>but nail polish from claires and Nicole by Opi and taller ones definitely need to go on the top shelf.</li>
      <li>I have a large nail polish collection and needed a way to display it so that I could see exactly what I had.  </li>
      <li>Maybe that count is for a certain brand.  </li>
      <li>Probably too large to sit on a vanity or dresser.</li>
      <li>Although it is large (no complaints here), it allows me to see every color I have</li>
      <li>I do not believe this to be a seller error however, because the display stand was packaged VERY well.  </li>
      <li>Construction seems to be very sturdy, but I have not loaded with polish.  </li>
      <li>Item just as described fast shipping.</li>
      <li>so if you need to move it move it with no polish in it its much lighter.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read the review and was anxious on its arrival.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to open it and put ALL of my nail polish in it!  Even the tall ones can fit on the top shelf.  And the space I picked for it was excellent!  GREAT BUY!, If you are a nailpolish hoarder.  Lol</li>
    <li> I received this item as a gift from my boyfriends parents for Christmas &amp; I love it!!!  It serves it&#x27;s purpose well and provides a professional &amp; unique look to anyone with a large nail polish collection that wants their collection beautifully displayed.  However two of the upper corners did arrive slightly busted/cracked.  The cracks do not hinder it&#x27;s function, however they are obvious to a knowing eye. I do not believe this to be a seller error however, because the display stand was packaged VERY well.  Either way it&#x27;s awesome but be aware it&#x27;s fragile to ship.  Also the sign at the top had to be super glued on to it&#x27;s base, I did not realize this and it doesn&#x27;t state anywhere in the packaging how to attach the sign.  Super gluing it was NOT a problem and overall I am a very happy receiver of this thoughtful gift!</li>
    <li> The rack is pretty but it came crack. I did not return it because I waited too long for it and I had more tha 100 nail polish needing a place to hold them. I didn&#x27;t want to wait another month to get it and I staid with it</li>
    <li> my shoe box where i usually keep my manicure stuff and polish was getting to be a hassle.. this is perfect.. i have in the middle part my manicure tools.. i know thats not what its intended for;  and i just luv it cos it holds all my polishes..  keeps everything organized so i know what colors i do have!! im very pleased. i have it just sitting on my dresser..</li>
    <li> I should have measured my space but of course I didn&#x27;t. When this arrived it was a lot bigger than I imagined. Other than having to find a different space in the salon to place it is perfect. It holds a ton of polish in all kinds of shapes. My last one wouldn&#x27;t accommodate bottles that were wide on bottom narrow on top. Opposite of OPI shape. This one holds all of them and rotates smoothly. I haven&#x27;t counted how many bottles I have on it but it&#x27;s a ton! If you have a lot of polish you need corral this is what you need.</li>
    <li> It was just like the picture. Unfortunately mines had a crack in the inside panel. I noticed it after I loaded 120+ polishes. Ugh I think I&#x27;ll just keep it bc to take the all down would be an inconvenience as well as unprofessional for my salon</li>
    <li> I love my rack. For me it&#x27;s just the right size to put on my desk &amp; fit all of my nail polish on.</li>
    <li> I gave this nail polish rack a perfect score because it&#x27;s the perfect size for my enormous nail polish collection.</li>
    <li> Finally got this nail polish rack, would have gotten before but amazon was out of stock. I just love it. Only wish it held more nail polish bottles.Already filled it up, thinking of getting another. Will recommend to friends. My nail polish bottles look so pretty and I could see all my colors beautifully!😁</li>
    <li> This rotating nail polish stand is amazing. The only bad thing was that the bottom shelf was a little cracked but nothing big to throw a fit about.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:moPBFCME0FZSS0]]I love this rack. It is so pretty.  I have a large nail polish collection and needed a way to display it so that I could see exactly what I had.  I kept the polish in a drawer which worked fine until I noticed I had started buying duplicates.  I tried to put the polish in order of color, but as you can see from the video, the Wet and Wild polish, which is the cheapest, is also the tallest, so it can only fit on the top shelf.  Also I&#x27;m so happy to be able to use the inside for storage.  The sign at the top comes off and I have cotton balls, cotton swabs, remover, files and nail decals stored inside.  The description says it holds 144, but my count is 166 with 3 or 4 spaces left.  Maybe that count is for a certain brand.  I buy what colors I like, regardless of the brand.  The seller also did a very good job with the shipping.  It was packaged very well and there were no cracks or scratches anywhere.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughter&#x27;s finger nail collection.  Works great!!  Now she can go shopping for more finger nail polish!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, very good looking, extremely practical and useful, wish I had seen it before I did, would make an excellent gift.</li>
    <li> I just love this rack, I&#x27;m able to put all my favorite polishes and see everything in a single turn. It makes picking out colors easy.  Most polish brands fit easily in the slots. I just wished I could have ordered it bigger so I could fit more polishes! The top cover came broken (no fault of the seller - the box was pretty mutilated by FedEx) and the seller quickly sent out a replacement cover.  I highly recommend this polish rack, it fits nicely on my bathroom counter and suprisingly doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
    <li> Love this display!! It arrived in perfect condition, thankfully!! Would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a convenient way to store and display your polishes!!</li>
    <li> Let me say first, this is a pretty big table rack.  I did read the dimensions, but I did not visualize it being this big.  I probably should have pulled out a tape measure.  It fits on my counter where I had planned on putting it, so no worries.  Construction seems to be very sturdy, but I have not loaded with polish.  Probably will be a good idea to balance out the polish on all 4 sides, spread top to bottom to keep it level for the turn table.  Seller packed well, and there is no damage.  I read others had issues with this, but no problems here.&lt;br /&gt;All the polish sits along the exterior on the shelves, leaving the center open all the way down the rack.  Perfect for me to store my polish remover, cotton balls, and cotton pads, with plenty of room.  I am even going to super-glue a small container to the inside wall of this area to store my manicure tools and clean-up brushes, so everything is in one unit. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> I just received this today as a birthday present and I love it.  It was well packaged so came unharmed.  It spins nicely and feels like it would hold up to some years of abuse.  With the amount of time I play with my polishes, even if just looking at them, that&#x27;s going to be a lot of spinning :-p  The black thing on top comes off so I suppose you could store something inside if you wanted to.</li>
    <li> Depending on the size of the bottles, I can turn them sideways and fit more on a row.  The rack came in wonderful shape.  It was packed very well, and the size is decent.  It spins very easily, and I am so happy that I have a place to put all the polish I just bought!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I had hoped for.  It displays our polish perfectly.  You can now see each and every one.  We were even able to place our shellac and vinylux bottles on it (they fit sideways).  This is a perfect display for a salon.  Probably too large to sit on a vanity or dresser.</li>
    <li> It reads that it holds up to 144 bottles and I was able to accommodate 151 bottles. Looks sharp on top of my bathroom cabinet.</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo5F6769O74BLI]]i have to admit i was a little skeptical about ordering this from the reviews that i read. i was worried it was going to arrive cracked. I received this on the first day of its estimated shipment which was jan 16th-22nd. i was so happy i received it early. I opened the box and it was very nicely packaged and not damaged when i took it out. just a note to future orderers&#x27; be very careful when you take it out of the box because it is plastic so don&#x27;t hold it tightly when you take it out of the box or it will crack. i thought i heard a crack on mine at first but it was fine. just be careful how you take it out of the box and you will be fine and when you have all the polish on it it can move by sliding it to the counter or wherever you are going to display it. i wouldn&#x27;t recommend picking it up with all the nail polish they will fall out. so if you need to move it move it with no polish in it its much lighter. i wasn&#x27;t sure how it was going to look when i got it from the picture it looks like the shelves go back all the way but they don&#x27;t. there is a big gap like where the sign is you can put stuff in there if you really wanted too. it does hold a lot of bottles. but nail polish from claires and Nicole by Opi and taller ones definitely need to go on the top shelf. but i counted mine and i have about 120 bottles that go from la nail, opi, essie, sally hansen, insta dry, crackle polish, elf, milani, ciate, and some tiny bottles all fit perfectly. so i would definitely recommend this it was a great price for the amount of bottles it could fit and fancy with the sign on top. love it! i have attached a video so you all can see what this looks like. i would definitely recommend it. it is more made for salon use but it could fit well in any home for anyone who loves nail art and has a lot of polish!</li>
    <li> I am in love with this display case.  I needed a way to keep my nail polishes organized and this is it!  Although it is large (no complaints here), it allows me to see every color I have and I don&#x27;t have to have it hanging on my wall.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this product. It holds all of my nail polish and accessories perfectly. It did however have a chip outta one of the upper corners when I received it which was probably due to shipping. Also, it was a bit bigger than I expected it to be so I had a hard time trying to find a home for it. Overall, it is a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> The BEST most accessible way to view your nail polish that I have found.  Although they take great care to package it, one of mine had a 3 inch crack in it.  The seller gave me the option of returning it for a new one, or getting a partial refund.  I&#x27;m opting for the partial refund because it&#x27;s useable.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it the full 5 stars is because of the crack, otherwise it&#x27;s perfect.  You can also turn the side on top upside down and stack on top of it.  Mine fits inside a built in cabinet to protect it from the sun and keep the room free of clutter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people who have large collections use Helmers, but it doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of not being able to see what you have.  Mine are separated by shade and I swatch them to be sure I don&#x27;t order anything close.  This was a very worthwhile purchase.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I needed.  I&#x27;ve had a couple of small drawers slowly filling up with polishes over the years and it&#x27;s wonderful to have something to put them all in.  Now I can see exactly what colors I have.  It&#x27;s perfect!  I flipped the top sign piece upside down so it&#x27;s just a flat black surface since it&#x27;s in my closet and not a store.  The plastic is thick and seems to be put together well.  :)</li>
    <li> Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish rack. It&#x27;s perfect and so cute on my end table. It looks very professional with the cute sign on top and it is very very sturdy on the table. Plenty of room for all of my polishes as well as nail files and nail art tools. It spins with ease and I absolutely loved organizing all of my polishes into it. It comes fully assembled so thats an extra nice tough. I&#x27;d buy this again and I&#x27;d recommend it. I only deducted one star because I felt the price was just a little high but it does seem to be of good quality so I guess price is just a minor consideration.</li>
    <li> The rack is very nice. Other then the fact it came chip on one side. It would have been 5 stars. Good thing is that she didn&#x27;t notice that is like that. Only I did. If not I would have been returning.</li>
