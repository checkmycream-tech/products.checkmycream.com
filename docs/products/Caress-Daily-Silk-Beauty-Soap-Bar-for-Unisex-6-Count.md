      <li>I know I&#x27;m going to be super clean .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So your not getting the true content of the soap .</li>
      <li>me know I&#x27;m super clean .</li>
      <li>it has such an awesome scent&amp;#60;smells sooo yummy on men, too!&amp;#62; that actually lingers on the body for awhile.</li>
      <li>The lather goes on smoothly on my skin and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Back to the review, bar scent is spectacular.</li>
      <li>Came pretty quickly too of course.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly, I love caress soap, actually it is the only kind I can use without breaking out.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it smells nice.</li>
      <li>I like it very much, although I have not started using it.</li>
      <li>This particular one contains peach and white orange blossom and has a nice scent.</li>
      <li>My third favorite soap.</li>
      <li>pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>With this soap, my pH must be balanced and my chakras in line, because I smell so fresh and so clean clean all day long.</li>
      <li>(secretly I wonder if it releases his pheromones because he smells so good!</li>
      <li>But this scent I really like.  </li>
      <li>No wonder there&#x27;s so much dirt</li>
      <li>Really like Caress soap.  </li>
      <li>I have children with sensitive skin who cannot use any other kind of soap.</li>
      <li>I also like that the manufacturer is generous with the amount of soap that the packages come in (due to me going through the soap pretty quick).</li>
      <li>and it is very creamy and soft.  </li>
      <li>I have tried a lot of bars of soaps in my time, including dial, ivory, and dove to name a few, but this caress soap just works better for me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t even use one bar of the Walmart and went right back to Caress.  </li>
      <li>Good smelling and long lasting in the shower... doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; like some other brands.</li>
      <li>I usually do not like scents and always opt for unscented everything.  </li>
      <li>Other soaps I think weren&#x27;t getting me clean .</li>
      <li>All these years I really wasn&#x27;t getting a deep clean using other soaps .</li>
      <li>Most other brands make my skin so dry  </li>
      <li>And it works for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin which is prone to eczema break-outs if soap is too drying.  </li>
      <li>Soft.</li>
      <li>I have been using Dove sensitive for 20 years</li>
      <li>With other soaps, I didn&#x27;t stay fresh all day.</li>
      <li>(I usually do the Dove for sensitive skin, no dyes no perfumes - but it wasn&#x27;t available for subscribe &amp; save).  </li>
      <li>However, if your hands are already dry and cracked from work, this soap won&#x27;t help as much as Dove.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only soap I can use -</li>
      <li>It also doesn&#x27;t form much of a squishy layer on the outside that most other soaps do if it remains wet between uses, so it lasts a little longer.</li>
      <li>I have to wash my hands several times a day, and this soap will not dry my hands out in the winter.</li>
      <li>It has a very soft scent, but not really noticeable.  </li>
      <li>Does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive skin dry!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s the only soap we use</li>
    <li> I have to wash my hands several times a day, and this soap will not dry my hands out in the winter. However, if your hands are already dry and cracked from work, this soap won&#x27;t help as much as Dove.  It won&#x27;t make the problem worse, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize quite as much.  I like the scent of this one over the others, and it lingers longer than Dove.  It also doesn&#x27;t form much of a squishy layer on the outside that most other soaps do if it remains wet between uses, so it lasts a little longer.</li>
    <li> This soap is the BOMB! it has such an awesome scent&amp;#60;smells sooo yummy on men, too!&amp;#62; that actually lingers on the body for awhile. You can FEEL the softness on your skin, too! It&#x27;s the only bar soap I&#x27;ll buy since discovering it by accident about 9months ago. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
    <li> Smells great and makes my skin really soft.</li>
    <li> Great product, we are a caress family and I love getting it online. Caress leaves your skin smooth and it smells so great. Most other brands make my skin so dry  but this one is the best.</li>
    <li> This is the original and it makes your skin soft and smells wonderful I love this and will always luse this.</li>
    <li> Really like Caress soap.  Makes your skin feel good and it moisturizes it.  Would recommend this soap for anyone.  Happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great and lathers easily which makes it feel great to use.... what more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of bars of soaps in my time, including dial, ivory, and dove to name a few, but this caress soap just works better for me. With other soaps, I didn&#x27;t stay fresh all day. With this soap, my pH must be balanced and my chakras in line, because I smell so fresh and so clean clean all day long. I am used to more unisex type soaps and I was a little afraid of this before I used it, because the packaging makes it seem very.... feminine and floral. But it was worth it! I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. This soap is MY soap!</li>
    <li> I hope I don&#x27;t have to write a review for this every time it is delivered.  It is great soap and all but it is SOAP.  There is not much more you can say than I have already said.  SOAP! LETS ALL USE SOME! DAILY!</li>
    <li> I usually do not like scents and always opt for unscented everything.  But this scent I really like.  We use this for bathing and also for homemade laundry soap.</li>
    <li> For over 16 years we&#x27;ve used this bar soap daily, and I don&#x27;t see any need to change this habit any time soon. I try the various scents and haven&#x27;t had any complaints from the family. This soap rinses cleanly without any unpleasant surprises left behind.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this is the only soap I can use - I&#x27;ve tried many, even others from Caress... but always get rashes, and itchy skin from anything but this one.  I like the price on this compared to the stores, and have it on subscribe&lt;br /&gt; and save.  It has a very soft scent, but not really noticeable.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over 33 years.. I&#x27;m stocking up a bit, since often things just stop production, and I would hate that!  LOL.</li>
    <li> This Caress Daily Silk Beauty Bar is one of my favorites due to the white peach and silky  orange blossom scent.  Additionally, I was able to get the bars for an affordable price at my job.  The lather goes on smoothly on my skin and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I also like that the manufacturer is generous with the amount of soap that the packages come in (due to me going through the soap pretty quick).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE ALWAYS LOVED THE SCENT AND GENTLENESS OF THIS SOAP.</li>
    <li> The two items are terrific.  Ajax cannot be beat as to it purpose, cleaning, hardly any scrubbing is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Caress does what it says, caresses.  Feels pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be talking to you soon.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget me.&lt;br /&gt;May</li>
    <li> I get migraines from overpowering &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; smells, so I was a little scared to purchase this (I usually do the Dove for sensitive skin, no dyes no perfumes - but it wasn&#x27;t available for subscribe &amp; save).  The smell is really nice but understated.  And it works for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive skin which is prone to eczema break-outs if soap is too drying.  I have been using Dove sensitive for 20 years but I might switch to this one permanently!</li>
    <li> The soap is excellent however neither of us like the string smell of White Peach &amp; Silky Orange Blossom. We put the extra bars in the linen closet and that may have been a mistake as everything in the closet smells like this soap. The soap is fine for taking a shower, we think a  milder smell would be better.</li>
    <li> Have loved the flavor and mold-to-hand  ease of application for many years. Also like the convenient count:  one month supply.</li>
    <li> Works great smells even better</li>
    <li> Does the job and doesn&#x27;t leave my sensitive skin dry! My third favorite soap. Came pretty quickly too of course.</li>
    <li> This soap is one I love to use and it is very creamy and soft.  This particular one contains peach and white orange blossom and has a nice scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using caress for 6 years on and off . I&#x27;ve tried dove , st Ives , and dial . ( I didn&#x27;t buy off amazon I got it at the store )&lt;br /&gt;But I swear this is the best soap. But one downside is does take a minute to get a lather going but once I do. It&#x27;s amazing . I scrub my body twice . And when I get out the shower  I&#x27;m shocked and amazed to see all my body dirt at the bottom of the tub. Hey it might be gross but that&#x27;s just let&#x27;s me know I&#x27;m super clean . Other soaps I think weren&#x27;t getting me clean . The hype about \\&quot;dove \\&quot;is so over rated .  All these years I really wasn&#x27;t getting a deep clean using other soaps . No wonder there&#x27;s so much dirt lol . This soap is perfect for sensitive skin which is what I have .&lt;br /&gt;I use this everyday in the shower . And so glad I found this on amazon because I&#x27;m stocking up on soap . And also I would recommend the bars over the body wash . As I feel body wash is just watered down . So your not getting the true content of the soap . I&#x27;m planning on using this with a scrub brush instead of a washcloth also mixing this with dr.bronners peppermint soap . I know I&#x27;m going to be super clean .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow I&#x27;m really going to be addicted to smelling myself . Get this soap . Cheap yet amazing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Did I mention it smells amazing :D I wish they made a body spray .</li>
    <li> Excellent for dry skin. Low it and the price!</li>
    <li> I like using this bar soap cause it leaves your skin with a clean scent. no residue left behind, just freah.</li>
    <li> My favorite soap. Prevents the dry skin without needing lotion.</li>
    <li> I have used Caress for over 40 years years.  A couple of months ago I stupidly thought I would try Walmarts store brand and I was just stuck on Caress.  I didn&#x27;t even use one bar of the Walmart and went right back to Caress.  Why change when I had a great thing going for me!!!</li>
    <li> Good smelling and long lasting in the shower... doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; like some other brands.</li>
    <li> I love it I have used caress always and that&#x27;s all I will ever use</li>
    <li> I like this soap and buying it in bulk is nice too.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it smells nice.</li>
    <li> I like Caress, mostly because of the way my husband smells after he showers. (secretly I wonder if it releases his pheromones because he smells so good!</li>
    <li> The bars are smaller but the packaging is the same. I have actually noticed this with other brands and products, e.g. Toothpaste (1/2 is air), cereal boxes (box width decreased, less cereal), ice cream, and oh my god don&#x27;t get me started with chips. I know this is not the appropriate place to vent this but where else could I? Back to the review, bar scent is spectacular.</li>
    <li> I started using this brand and fragrance over a year ago and I switched to something else but went back to this brand. Love it!</li>
    <li> No need to change. Not too flowery, cleans well and best of all doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling stiff and nasty like many soaps do. Picture the little white bar in a hotel ... unpleasant, right? Not caress. Soft.</li>
    <li> Got this soap for my mother as a christmas gift. 6 bars for that price...get outta town :) Very Happy</li>
    <li> Repeat order, pity it&#x27;s been taken off the subscribe and save . . . .</li>
    <li> My favorite soap! I have children with sensitive skin who cannot use any other kind of soap. Caress is soft and silky and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue like other brands. We LOVE it!</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, I love caress soap, actually it is the only kind I can use without breaking out.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it was the one with white peach and a blend of silk blossom,but the one I received was white peach and orange blossom.There is a difference in the scent between the two.The one I regularly use is a lighter scent which does not bother my allergies and asthma.The one with the orange blossom is a stronger scent.Anyone buying this product thinking it is the lighter scented one beware because I found out that the manufacturer put the same bar code with the same numbers on both scents,so if you are wanting the one with a blend of silk blossom and think that is what you will get you will have to call to ask about it to order.No ones fault,but the manufacturers.</li>
    <li> This body beauty soap smells great and fresh, just like flowers. I like it very much, although I have not started using it.</li>
    <li> I love this soap. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t over dry it. My kids even love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> Everyone loves Caress, and I give it in gift boxes.</li>
</ol>
