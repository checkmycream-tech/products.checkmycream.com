      <li>LOVE IT!</li>

      <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the BEST at separating your lashes and is non clumping and offers build able volume!</li>
      <li>Great formula; the only formula that doesn&#x27;t make my eyes itch; smooth and easy to apply; perfectly shaped wand....</li>
      <li>in fact, it takes a couple of applications, which is fine by me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that I was able to find it here, after searching everywhere in town for it.  </li>

      <li>Luckily Amazon had it!</li>

      <li>I love the applicator and it&#x27;s just the right blend of product to go on without clumping.</li>
      <li>The right color, brownish black, is perfect.</li>

      <li>It was a fantastic bargain and the package came extremely early!</li>
      <li>&#x27;Maybelline Volume Express 1 on 1 Washable Mascara&#x27; seems to me to be the same recipe as the old  &#x27;Maybelline Great Lash&#x27; mascara, but with a new name and in a new package.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much for the opportunity to get multiples of this product and for such a surprising low price.</li>
      <li>Have used for years and really like.</li>
      <li>No clumping, nice and fluffy lashes.  </li>
      <li>I like this mascara better than any other, including Mary Kay.</li>
      <li>The mascara is the kind that I usually always buy from the drug store for around 9$ each.</li>
      <li>Its the same product I bought in the store a while back that has been discontinued, but it is much more clumpy.</li>
      <li>It goes on well and separates the lashes for a natural look.</li>
      <li>Maybe the last tube I had was too, but only when it was new</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really think the irritation I have due to this mascara is likely to be any fault in this product.</li>

<li> But the gobs of mascara in the wand are annoying nonetheless.</li>

    <li> I wish this was not a discontinued product. I love the applicator and it&#x27;s just the right blend of product to go on without clumping.</li>
    <li> Best mascara ever! Hope they don&#x27;t discontinue production!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this in our local stores anymore. Luckily Amazon had it! It goes on well and separates the lashes for a natural look. It&#x27;s not clumpy. But it may need an extra layer applied if you want it to last into the evening. Washes off easily.</li>

    <li> Absolutely awesome mascara you can keep adding coats without spikes. No flaking.  No clumping, nice and fluffy lashes.  Easily removed. Let dry before additional coats. People ask what mascara I am using all the time. Try it you&#x27;ll love it! 😊</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anywhere retail, as Maybelline has discontinued.  Have used for years and really like.</li>
    <li> The only brush that coats each eyelash and doesn&#x27;t clump.  Don&#x27;t know why Maybeline discontinued it.  Thanks so much for the opportunity to get multiples of this product and for such a surprising low price.</li>
    <li> Almost Five Stars.....not 100% clump-free.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the BEST at separating your lashes and is non clumping and offers build able volume!</li>
    <li> Its the same product I bought in the store a while back that has been discontinued, but it is much more clumpy. Maybe the last tube I had was too, but only when it was new and I&#x27;ve since forgforge issue. But the gobs of mascara in the wand are annoying nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Flexible wand and smudge free all day wear are the reasons this mascara is a must. Easily removable too.</li>
    <li> Arrived well before expected date. My favorite mascara I can&#x27;t find anywhere in stores! Just what I needed!</li>
    <li> Love this bundle deal! The mascara is the kind that I usually always buy from the drug store for around 9$ each. It was a fantastic bargain and the package came extremely early! Right before school started!</li>
