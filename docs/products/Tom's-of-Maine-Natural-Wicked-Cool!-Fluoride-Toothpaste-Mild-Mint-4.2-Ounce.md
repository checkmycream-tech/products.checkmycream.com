<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My kids really enjoyed using this toothpaste.  Has great taste and works well for cleaning.  Plus it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> Love the way the paste stands which makes it easier to use. The flavor if kind of blah. Regardless a good price for a good toothpaste. You can save more using Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save Program.</li>
    <li> This has been used by family members to help ease canker sore issues with our kiddos.  Ready helps and makes brushing teeth very soothing.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste that my daughter will use. Typical minty flavors of other products are too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; for her, but this one leaves her teeth clean and her mouth refreshed.</li>
    <li> One of my kids hates the mint and one doesn&#x27;t care.  Of course.</li>
    <li> Nice mild mint flavor.  Good in between step for kids who are not ready for adult toothpaste.  Fine slayer of dragon breath.</li>
    <li> I would buy this again. I love Tom&#x27;s of Maine products!</li>
    <li> My Mom likes the toothpaste, may brands she turns up her nose, but his works.</li>
    <li> My kids will not use this as they say the taste is very harsh and abrasive.oh well, they like the orange/strawberry flavors.</li>
    <li> My kids whine a little bit about it, but that&#x27;s cause they&#x27;re used to the other junk toothpaste.  They still use it, though, and that&#x27;s more than I can say about the strawberry flavor (I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with them myself, however).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t overwhelming in mint.  This mint is as mild as it gets!  I love it and hope they don&#x27;t stop making it any time soon.</li>
    <li> My son is not so fond of the flavor. I think it could be a bit sweeter for the kids.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360. This one is a winner! All of my children like this toothpaste, not just my 8 year old. And as a mom I feel good about giving my children a natural toothpaste.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve used the adult toothpaste and the little kid toothpaste, but that really left out our eight year old.  He was past the bubblegum and strawberry type flavors, but not quite ready for the zing of a full mint toothpaste.  After trying our sample, he loves this toothpaste and his brothers beg to use it too.  It&#x27;s very mild and refreshing and definitely kills bad morning breath:) I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids are ages 7 and 9. They always were complaining that they did not like the baby bubble gum toothpastes but thought mine was too hot. This product is right in the middle and it comes from a great company!</li>
    <li> I have an 11 year old daughter and she is the eldest of my 4 children.I like that it&#x27;s something special for just her. She&#x27;s the only one who is old enough to use it so it&#x27;s just hers. She thinks she&#x27;s too old for the baby stuff my other children use so having something only she could use made her feel special. When she has tried my toothpaste in the past she said it burned her mouth but the mint flavoring in this toothpaste is mild enough that she feels like she&#x27;s using a big girl toothpaste but without burning her mouth. I like that it had no artificial colors,favors,or dyes in it while still doing just as great of a job at preventing cavities,strengthening enamel and freshening breath. I would recommend this product. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received a sample through Smiley360 and let my kids try it.  They don&#x27;t like strong toothpastes.  This one had a very good flavor and neither of my kids have complained about the taste at all.  That is unusual for my 2!</li>
    <li> My grandson loved it! We received a free sample from smiley360, and it was one of the better ones! He said it tasted like candy canes and I think he even brushed longer than usual.  I will be the toothpaste of choice here.</li>
    <li> My children were very excited about this toothpaste. My 7 year old loved this product, loved the flavor and said teeth felt super clean. My 5 year old did not like it because it was too spicy. lol All in all I would definitely purchase this product.</li>
    <li> My children were very excited about this toothpaste. My 7 year old loved this product, loved the flavor and said teeth felt super clean. My 5 year old did not like it because it was too spicy. lol All in all I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked cool toothpaste from smiley360. My son usually has to be prompted about brushing his teeth. My parents use the toms all natural flavor which omes out in a brown color. He HATES it and  says it smells \\&quot;different\\&quot;. So he was pretty hesitant to try this one. In comparison it tasted great and the tube was \\&quot;cool\\&quot;. We found a new favorite!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360. My daughter wasn&#x27;t sure about trying this toothpaste since she has always used the Toms of Maine strawberry flavored children&#x27;s toothpaste &amp; she does not like the minty taste of regular toothpaste. However, after using it for several days in a row, she agreed that it makes her teeth feel clean &amp; does not taste TOO minty. So def a winner in our household. It is a bit pricey compared to other toothpaste like Crest &amp; Colgate. It would be nice to have coupons for it.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.  We had a hard time finding a toothpaste that wasn&#x27;t for toddlers and not as strong as adult toothpaste.  THEY LOVED THIS ONE! I am so glad I don&#x27;t have to persuade them to brush any longer.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this for my 8 year old to try out and see what he thinks. We got this sample from Smiley360! He loves it! One, it&#x27;s something that he doesn&#x27;t have to share with his little brother and sister. Two, he said that taste is great. It makes his mouth feel fresh and clean. It is a little \\&quot;spicy\\&quot;, which he says makes him feel like his mouth is cleaner than with the other toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Received a sample of the toothpaste from Smiley360 and the kids love it even the adult ones makes brushing your teeth a lot of fun!</li>
    <li> My 8 year old daughter who doesn&#x27;t usually like minty toothpaste said she liked this one.  It wasn&#x27;t too minty and she said her mouth felt fresh.</li>
    <li> My sons received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s Wicked cool toothpaste to try out. They liked that it was a mint flavored toothpaste and not a fruity or bubble gum flavor.  They also liked that the mint wasn&#x27;t too over powering. I like that it clean their teeth and got rid of bad breath! I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids (ages 10 &amp; 8) are accustomed to using watermelon flavored toothpaste. I wanted to transition them to something that was more grown up, without all the harmful ingredients that are known to be in some toothpastes. We tried this toothpaste and were pleasantly surprised. The mint taste isn&#x27;t too strong, although my 8 year old called it \\&quot;spicy.\\&quot; I like the way their breath smells after they use it and it seems to do a great job of cleaning their teeth. I think we would buy it in the future. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360/</li>
    <li> My kids loved this toothpaste better than the other kids type of toothpaste. They said it wasn&#x27;t as chalky or bland like the berry types. They liked the smoothness and found the flavor to remind them of peppermint candy canes. Would definetly buy this in the future! I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from smiley 360 to try for free and my 6 sons love the taste of it.  My sons like that its not too strong and I like that is has no  artificial dyes, sweeteners or flavors.  Its all natural.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My son loves the mild, yet long lasting freshness, of this minty toothpaste. He commented immediately on how clean his teeth feel after brushing. He also enjoys how shiny his teeth look.</li>
    <li> I have been trying to get my son to use a mint toothpaste but all of them so far have been too minty he says and burns his mouth. We tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked cool toothpaste! I was a little concerned he wouldn&#x27;t like it since he didn&#x27;t like the others we tried. I thought I would have him try this since it says it&#x27;s for kids and not too minty. To my surprise not only did he not complain about it, he loves it! He said it tasted like a mint candy! The best part I like about it, is that the toothpaste is all natural which is very important to me and my family!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is perfect for children over seven years old. My son is 10 and he needed a stronger toothpaste than the regular children&#x27;s toothpaste. He didn&#x27;t like the taste of regular toothpaste but found the Tom&#x27;s flavor to be great. As a parent, I like that it is a natural toothpaste without being too expensive. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I had my daughter who is 8 years old try Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste mint flavor and she seemed to love it we have since gone back to the stored to buy another one. She said it make her mouth feel clean and is not to harsh on the flavoring. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste and my tween loves it.  It&#x27;s mild mint flavor is easier on younger mouths, but a step up from the fruity toothpastes.</li>
    <li> My kids really liked this toothpaste and will definitely use it again. They loved the flavor of it. I told everyone about this product.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> my kids are really picky when it comes to toothpaste flavor they only like the fruity ones I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360 and at first my kids thought it was too minty but after a few uses they grew to like the taste. i like it because its natural and even use it on my 2 yr old</li>
    <li> I recieved a free sample of this toothpaste for children from smiley 360. My kids are not real big fans of other childrens tooth paste. They would rather just use my toothpaste. When I told them to first try it they were like it&#x27;s ok. But as they kept using it the more they liked it. needless to say now i get to buy them a childrens toothpaste. and they can leave mine alone</li>
    <li> I was sent a full size product of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Fluoride toothpaste mint flavored for kids 8+ so I could have my kids try it and see if they liked it or if they hated it. The very first time they used it, they absolutely LOVED it and also loved the taste much better than any of the other toothpastes they had used in the past.  In fact, they gave it a TWO thumbs up and asked if Tom&#x27;s of Main Wicked Cool could be their new permanent toothpaste and even said their friends would be jealous that they would get to use a toothpaste that had the words \\&quot;Wicked Cool\\&quot; in it and that their friends would be begging their parents to let them change their toothpaste too HA HA HA!!! Thanks to Smiley360, my kids get a new toothpaste with a cool name as well as a healthy teeth protector. Thank you Smiley360 and Tom&#x27;s of Maine![[ASIN:B004M9AOOC Tom&#x27;s of Maine Whole Care Fluoride Toothpaste, Wintermint, 4.7-Ounce (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I gave this to my son and he really seems to like it. He said it was good and gives it a 5 stars out of 5. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My son loves Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool! toothpaste!  He loves that it is not too minty (or spicy) but it still makes his breath feel fresh.  I love that it has all natural ingredients.  We have been searching for a toothpaste that isn&#x27;t fruity or too minty.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool! Fluorida toothpaste is the perfect toothpaste for us!  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My 9 yr old did not like this so much. He was excited about the name and the fact that it was geared towards kid his age. He did not like the paste, he normally uses a gel. He also did not like the mint flavor. I told him to give it a few more tries and he did, but there was no  change in his opinion. He is very picky. I would say to give it try though, it is all natural. Tom&#x27;s makes great natural products. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My Daughter loves using this toothpaste! She loves the yummy taste and I also love it because of how clean it seems to make her teeth and how long her fresh breath lasts.

    <li> We didn&#x27;t want the fruit flavors for the kids, and our dentist didn&#x27;t recommend them. We tried using our adult toothpaste butt he mint flavor was too strong for our 3 year old. This is perfect because it is a mild mint flavor. And it is very very hard to find so we always get it on amazon.</li>
    <li> Both my son and daughter loved the taste! They have outgrown kid toothpaste but do not like the taste of adult toothpaste so this was a great in between for them.</li>

    <li> My kids did not like the toothpaste so much. They both said it was not minty enough and didn&#x27;t leave them feeling very fresh and clean afterwards. My son said it had a strange and kind of \\&quot;slimy\\&quot; consistency. They didn&#x27;t say it was totally horrible, but they wouldn&#x27;t ask to use it again. I tried it myself and came to the same conclusions that they did. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would have to give it about 5. I do like the fact that the ingredients are more natural, but I really like to feel minty fresh after I brush, and so do my kids. This may be better for younger children, as my kids are 10 and 11.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>

    <li> I was a little Leary on if my son would like Tom&#x27;s wicked cool mild mint toothpaste or not. He typically uses the Colgate bubble gum flavored. You know with spongebob or other characters on the front? So I didn&#x27;t know quite how my son would react to the minty flavor, since he doesn&#x27;t like other mint flavored toothpastes. Well he loved it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample free from smiley360 and the day I recieved it in the mail that night he wanted to use it! While he was brushing his teeth I asked him if he liked it. He shook his head yes. Then once he was done he asked me if we could buy that kind now! Lol.. I was so shocked! I mean no more spongebob? Wow! Lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S yes I would recommend this to others. Even if your child doesn&#x27;t like mint. Since it really is a mild mint flavor.

    <li> My son normally doesn&#x27;t like \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; toothpaste, so this is perfect for him!  Not too much flavor, but enough to freshen his breath :)</li>
    <li> This product is a good trainer product for adult toothpaste.  It&#x27;s a milder version of mint.  One out of 4 kids liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm)&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360</li>
    <li> My kids really like this product.  Colorful packaging and great taste!  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I have three children who have always been pretty resistant to brushing three times a day. I gave them the sample tube I received through smiley360 and it was gone in two days. All of them asked me to get more after arguing who was able to use the last of the tube. Definitely a great product</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this toothpaste from Smiley 360. My daughter usually hates any minty toothpaste because of the overpowering mint flavor. She was okay with using this and works a lot better for that morning breath than say the bubblegum flavored toothpaste of other brands. I will continue to use this for my 4 year old.</li>
    <li> One of the best toothpastes out there, not to harsh, and gives excellent results. I have tried other toothpastes with the kids, but this one seems to be the best one out there.</li>
    <li> My kids really like this toothpaste. I have bought other brands that they hate and so they will not brush their teeth. It is important they like the toothpaste and that it helps prevent cavities. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> This is a very COOL toothpaste. My kids love it. I also had to try it myself. It has a light mint flavor. Its not too strong. Perfect for kids!~\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I will be buying more in the near future for them, and also telling all my friends who have children about this wonderful product</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool! Toothpaste from Smiley360. I was excited to have an all natural toothpaste for my boys to use and thought they would like the mint (we didn&#x27;t like the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Strawberry) however they refused to use it after the first taste :( I tried it myself and was disappointed in the odd flavor it had, that nearly gagged me. We will not purchase this. However, everyone has different tastes and likes, so try it for yourself, only get a small one to start with!</li>
    <li> My family recieved this product as a free trial from Smiley 360.  My 9 year old son was excited to receive a package and ripped it open, ran upstairs and tried it right away.  His first reaction was that it was \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but he said he would try it a few more times.  We packed it in his travel bag and he uses it when we go on trips.  I tried it as well, on one of our trips, and then we talked about it.  We both felt that the flavor wasnt strong enough.  It did the job of cleaning our teeth, but it felt a little dry and didnt leave us with that fresh monty clean feeling that other traditional toothpastes leave.  It wasnt awful, but it also wasnt something that we looked forward to using.  We love the look of the product however!  Its got a great catchy-looking tube with appealing colors and print.  Unfortunately for us, the look of the product was more exciting than the actual product.</li>
    <li> My 8-year-old daughter loves the minty-fresh flavor of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Flouride Toothpaste! She even brushes more often now claiming her breath is fresh and her teeth are squeaky-clean! As a mom, any toothpaste that makes my kids want to brush is a winner with me! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I received a tube of toms toothpaste from smiley360 and i let my kids use it. took some getting used to but they love it. they said the mint flavor is awesome and makes them feel like a big kid.</li>

    <li> I received this as a sample from smiley360.  My daughter is 8 years old and was hesitant to try anything that had \\&quot;minty\\&quot; on it.

It is a little pricey in my opinion though.</li>

    <li> My children are so picky with their toothpaste.. always a challenge to get them to brush. I received a free sample of Toms of Maine toothpaste and my children loved it.  They said it did not burn their mouth and had a good flavor other than bubblegum. Also the packaging is modern and cool and this was a plus. Thank you Toms of Maine for making brushing and dental care more enjoyable.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360 and I&#x27;m very impressed with this toothpaste!my daughter is picky regarding toothpaste but this one is her favorite now.she says that its fresh and not burning in her mouth&amp;iexcl;</li>
    <li> My child liked the toothpaste quite a bit. It was not too minty and had a nice overall flavor. From what I can tell it does a good job getting those teeth clean. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> we got a free sample of this, we thought the flavor was strong. My kids didnt really care for it. I like that its natural. But doesnt foam up like regular toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I was fortunate enough, as others, to have received a free sample of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste for kids through Smiley360. In our house, each of the children have their own needs when it comes to dental care, and it is hard to find a toothpaste that is one size fits all. However, I was pleasant surprised with this toothpaste. We currently we at the point where using the Kid&#x27;s toothpaste from both Colgate and Crest were not enough and it didn&#x27;t leave the kids with that clean mouth feeling that we feel is necessary at their ages (8-11). The standard Kids toothpastes are messy, sloppy, and they don&#x27;t seem to really focus on appropriate dental needs and concerns that children should be developing as they age and begin to understand the importance of dental hygiene. In order to combat this, we started the kids on just regular adult toothpaste (none of those fancy ones with all sorts of different things that they target) and we found that it was just too much for the kids and that it actually prevented them from brushing as frequently and as long as they are supposed to because the taste was too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste was an absolute perfect balance for the children. The mint flavor was just exactly what they needed to get that fresh mouth feeling without having it be to overpowering and obnoxious. As a result, the kids have enjoyed brushing their teeth with it, they brush more frequently (whereas it was an absolute chore before), and for the standard two minutes recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to receiving the sample, I have heard of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine name, but never tried anything by them. The allure of a natural toothpaste or any natural hygiene product truthfully is not of a huge concern to my family, but after trying the sample, the quality and the fact that it has helped the children to develop better dental hygiene has made Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste a winner in my book and in this household. The toothpaste met our need for quality and the appropriate balance between a kid&#x27;s toothpaste and the standard adult toothpaste.eed for quality and the appropriate balance between a kid&#x27;s toothpaste and the standard adult toothpaste.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste and my 8 year old daughter enjoyed it so much that she insisted that we buy it. Guess the sample paid off. LOL Her opinion was that the flavor was minty but not too much which she has hated about regular toothpaste and I love that it&#x27;s natural so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it.</li>
    <li> My daughter thought this toothpaste was \\&quot;okay\\&quot; - no real excitement with taste, found it a little less foamy, rather go on up to an adult toothpaste.  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My kids are always asking for fruity toothpastes so I didn&#x27;t think they would like this toothpaste! But. boy was I wrong! They love it! They are begging to brush their teeth now! :) I highly recommend this toothpaste, not only is it good for the kids, they love using it!  (I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.com)</li>
    <li> My son love the taste and he said that his teeth felt clean. I was glad to see something other than the usual bubble gum flavors. This is definitely toothpaste good for the tweens. This price is very comparable to the brand that I usually purchase.</li>
    <li> Although it seemed to brush well we never got the clean mouth feeling on this. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> Very happy with TOMs Of MAINE NATURAL WICKED COOL FLUORIDE TOOTHPASTE.&lt;br /&gt;As a mom.I am happy that it fights cavities, strengthens enamel, it freshens breath &amp; dye free.&lt;br /&gt;It is made for kids 8 &amp; up, &amp; my 10 year old daughter uses it &amp; also enjoys it because its not  the \\&quot;baby kind\\&quot;. It has a mild mint flavor made especially for kids her age. It leaves her mouth fresh &amp; no filmy residue or over whelming taste.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that Toms of Maine Natural Wicked Cool Toothpaste contains flouride &amp; because they are more natural &amp; still ADA approved.&lt;br /&gt;Its a win win situation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Toms of Maine® Wicked Cool Toothpaste with flouride  for kids 8+ from Smiley360</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste with Flouride from smily360.com so that I could review it and share my opinions with others!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 4 kids (11, 11, 9, 8) all LOVED it! It is the first natural toothpaste they have tried, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but they all said that it tasted good and they would use it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m psyched that I finally found a natural product that my kids actually *want* to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give Tom&#x27;s of Maine an A+ and 5-star rating for creating a \\&quot;Mom and Kid Approved\\&quot; natural product!</li>
    <li> I got this to  try for free thanks to smiley360.  I let my son try it as soon as we received our sample and since then the free sample is gone and I have purchased more.  I love that its all natural as a parent that is important to me.  His review was that he loved the mild mint he said it wasn&#x27;t as strong and didn&#x27;t have that bite to it that the normal toothpaste we use does.  I also love that it doesn&#x27;t contain any egg since we have a child with an egg allergy in the house.  We have to be careful with toothpaste as some do contain egg so we will definitely be keeping Tom&#x27;s of Maine toothpaste in out house!</li>
    <li> Got this toothpaste as a sample from Smiley360 and my son loved this toothpaste even though he loves his fruity toothpaste. He really enjoyed the minty clean feeling. The packing is pretty cool too.</li>

    <li> I received a sample of this product from a Smiley360 campaign. My 10 year old daughter agreed to try the product and give me her feedback. She thought that it was OK, but nothing spectacular. She wanted the mint flavor to be stronger and was turned off by the white color of the toothpaste. I tried it myself so that I could add my own review and agreed with her assessment that it was a very mild mint flavor (which would be a good thing if you have a child who doesn&#x27;t like strong mint flavor). I didn&#x27;t feel like it got my breath clean and minty (but that isn&#x27;t the goal for most kids, I guess!) I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from Smiley360.</li>

    <li> My kids love Tom&#x27;s toothpaste but they were starting to grow out of the fruity flavors but wasnt much for the extremely minty one in adults so when Smiley 360 sent us a sample of the wicked cool toothpaste my kids couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. They loved the new minty taste. It was not too minty it was more of a sweet mint. They loved it and I like that it gets my kids to brush their teeth and best part was Toms is all natural. This is a great toothpaste! I definitely recommend it to all parents of preteens and teens or little ones they want more mint flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.</li>

He liked the flavor of the Toms toothpaste and said it made his mouth feel really clean.  My younger son doesn&#x27;t like mint flavored toothpastes that much because he says they burn his mouth.  He tried the Toms toothpaste and said it had a good flavor that didn&#x27;t burn his mouth.  They used it for a couple of weeks and both seemed to like it.  I like that it is a more natural product.  I received a free sample of Toms of Maine Natural Wicked Cool Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>

My 9 year old groans every time I ask him o brush his teeth, he&#x27;s just too busy to take time out of his day to bother with grooming and hygiene. I was pleasantly surprised that he was very excited to try this toothpaste.  In fact, he didn&#x27;t once complain when being asked to brush while using this toothpaste. I have found a replacement for the other kids toothpastes I was purchasing....thank you Tom&#x27;s for creating s product that makes my son want to brush his teeth!</li>

I will definately continue to use this toothpaste for my son and would reccommend it to my friends and family too :)</li>

    <li> Since I received this as a free sample I tried it before giving it to my kids to try. I enjoyed the mild mint flavor and it did a great job at cleaning my teeth. When choosing toothpastes for my kids the flavor is always a problem because they are overpowering. So after trying it for myself I knew Tom&#x27;s was going to be a winner! My kids both enjoyed the mild mint flavor and the fun colorful packaging! We have two different flavors and brands of toothpaste in the drawer and Tom&#x27;s is the one they grab! \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Nice mint taste and great packaging. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I got this as a trial product from smiley 360. My 9 year old son is very sensitive to regular adult toothpaste and the candy flavored child toothpaste does not work well enough. The Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool was a great middle ground for him. It was mildly minty, cleaned his teeth, and freshened his breath. No complaints from him or me!</li>
    <li> My 7 1/2 year old daughter who is eager to move on to a &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34;, minty tasting toothpaste likes this one.  The mint flavor is not as strong and spicy as adult ones, but it leaves your mouth more refreshed than those kids toothpastes that taste like candies.</li>
    <li> I received a sample from Smiley360 and my kids loved it. They think that it is minty fresh!! I would for sure buy this product .</li>
    <li> The kids liked the mint flavor and I really liked the natural ingredients. I received a free sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste from Smiley 360</li>
    <li> I received this sample product through Smiley360. My daughter is not a mint fan, so when she tried it she actually liked using it! The mild mint flavor is great! Now I can buy a full size product for her!!\\&quot;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My 8 year old son just tried recently the free sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste that we received from Smiley360. He really liked it! He has always told me that grown up toothpaste tastes too spicy and little kids toothpaste tastes like candy so this is a good happy medium.</li>
    <li> My daughter turned her nose up when she heard I had Toms toothpaste for her. She hated the original one. She tried the wicked cool kind and absolutely loves it!! I only had the sample tube so it didn&#x27;t last long but she requested that I buy a BIG tube next time.</li>
    <li> My kids love this cool toothpaste a ton. Just enough taste for my kids without being too overpowering. Best part is that I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My son came to me this morning with the tube and said it was empty and he wanted more... he loved it!!! The tatse was great and not so minty his mouth was on firew tasting</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360 and I&#x27;d have to say, it&#x27;s awesome! I love the taste, and so doesn&#x27;t my niece! The mint isn&#x27;t strong, and it doesn&#x27;t take much to get your mouth clean. Not to mention, it&#x27;s cheap and ALL NATURAL! The one thing I don&#x27;t like, is that it does leave a weird after taste, but once you use it for a while, it goes away!</li>
    <li> So my daughter being the comedic type that she is says that Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool is wickedly refreshing. I suppose that&#x27;s a pretty good stamp of approval. When she uses it she laughs and smiles because she feels like a hipster brushing her teeth. What is even cooler is the conversations it&#x27;s stirred up at the watering hole (school). Apparently she decided to ask her friends about what kind of toothpaste they use. She told them all if they wanted a wickedly refreshing smile that they would need to make the switch to Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste. According to reliable sources at least one kid went home and asked their Mom to buy it for them. Apparently being hip is pretty important nowadays. So if it takes a cool tube and a clever name to get children talking about brushing their teeth than who am I to complain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My daughter who&#x27;s very picky about her toothpaste said it was good. Very minty, but good minty not hot minty as she put it!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Fluoride Toothpaste from Smiley360. My kids love the way it taste however it&#x27;s smells funny to me and it&#x27;s uber expensive but i was happy to try it .</li>
    <li> I tried it for my son and he liked it. He liked the minty, cool flavor. I highly recommend it to my friends and family and anybody who wants a naturally-made toothpaste. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I just recieved my free sample from smiley60.com and decided to have my kids tried it out. They weren&#x27;t too pleased with it they weren&#x27;t a fant of the mint flavor. They prefer fruity flavors.</li>
    <li> My son loved this toothpaste - his mouth felt clean without that burning mint feeling. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> My children had already been using adult toothpaste when they tried it. Although they liked Tom&#x27;s toothpaste, they did not think it had very much taste to it. I think this was mainly because they are used to adult strong mint tasting toothpaste. With that said, they did like the toothpaste but would not choose it if given the option. I think this would be a great transition toothpaste for kids to go from toddler toothpaste to adult toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> This is the first toothpaste that all 3 of my kids have given the thumbs up to!!! looking forward to only having 1 tube of toothpaste in the kids bathroom :)</li>
    <li> I received a sample from smiley 360 to try for free and my 6 sons love the taste of it. My sons like that its not too strong and I like that is has no artificial dyes, sweeteners or flavors. Its all natural.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample tube from Smiley 360 and my kids LOVED it! It helped their breath and they said it tasted great so it was a win win!</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of this product and my kids actually loved it. They were not a fan of the toms of main strawberry  flavor i had gotten for them once but this one was great. They didnt fight me as much to brush teeth, and didnt complain about the taste. and i love its all natural!</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste is awesome!! My kids have never been a fan of kids toothpastes, but I tried the Tom&#x27;s wicked Cool to give it a try and my kids are actually brushing their teeth at least twice a day!!  I tried it myself and it is good!!  As a mom, I think the best thing is it is all natural.  I am a definite fan and will be the standard in my house form now on!</li>
    <li> Approves!  It does not happen very often.  Most toothpastes are too \\&quot;hot\\&quot; for him.  My son has outgrown the toddler options. He likes this one though.</li>
    <li> My kids loved this toothpaste mainly because of the taste.  They both don&#x27;t like KIDDIE toothpaste anymore- they call it baby toothpaste- you know that bubblegum taste.  They don&#x27;t like our toothpaste because it&#x27;s too minty. Before I got this toothpaste to review I didn&#x27;t quite know what to get them next because I need them to brush their teeth and they were fighting with me because they didn&#x27;t like the toothpaste we had.  Then BAM got some Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley360 to try and guess what NO ARGUING now- they love the taste.  Not too minty and not baby toothpaste is what both my kids said.  Also my son said his teeth felt very clean for hours- LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I LOVE is that is it has no artificial dyes, sweeteners or flavors!!!  So that makes 3 Thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Tom&#x27;s of Maine is a brand my family trusts and uses.  However, my son (who prefers bubble gum and fruit flavored toothpaste) thought the flavor was still too minty for him.  I handed down my sample tube to the kids I nanny, and they liked it!  So I guess it just depends on the kid using it.  I will still buy and recommend this brand!</li>
    <li> I got this toothpaste for my son and he absolutely loved it! I will continue buying this product and will be delighted to share with friends!</li>
    <li> I received a free sample from Smiley 360 of the toothpaste to try and then share my feedback. My son, who normally doesn&#x27;t like mint toothpaste, absolutely loved it! He said the taste wasn&#x27;t strong and overpowering like all of the other mint toothpastes he has tried. Now this is the only toothpaste that he will use.</li>
    <li> My nephews, who are 6 &amp; 9, and my 2 yr old daughter loved it!  The boys liked the minty flavor that wasn&#x27;t harsh like most adult toothpastes are, yet it wasn&#x27;t kiddy-bubblegum-flavored.  Their favorite part was the name, though.  My daughter seemed to love it, too, but of course she just loves to do whatever the boys do.  My SIL loved that it was made from all natural ingredients.  \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My 9 year old daughter loved it!  She thinks she&#x27;s too cool for her sisters&#x27; Dora toothpaste, so she that it was awesome to have a kids-oriented toothpaste that was just for her!  Very minty!  “I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!™ Toothpaste from Smiley360.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> my kids said they really like it&gt;  they also like the design on the package.  It did a very good job of cleaning their teeth too.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the house loved this toothpaste! It has a great mild flavor that the kids likes way better than the regular strong minty flavor of other brands. Even the adults prefer it :)  The only downside is the cost is a little higher.</li>
    <li> My kids love the flavor of this toothpaste and I love that it&#x27;s natural and not full of yucky ingredients. My older daughter is 11 and hates the fruity flavors that they have for kids. My five year old also uses this (it says 8 and up but he knows not to swallow!).</li>
    <li> My kid is very new to brushing her teeth with toothpaste but she seemed to love the minty flavor. I tried it too and I like how the flavor does not burn, which was very important for me when getting a toothpaste for my daughter. Also I really trust the Toms of Maine brand. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My daughter is loving using a more \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; toothpaste. Although she is not quite ready for a full-blown, adult mint toothpaste, she had rally outgrown the strawberry toothpaste. I am glad that Tom&#x27;s has created this option for the in-between kids. My daughter enjoys the flavor and I trust the Tom&#x27;s brand.</li>
    <li> myki ds just loved this toothpaste i would reccommend to anyone that has kids that don&#x27;t like brushing this should make them like brushing more tastes great</li>
    <li> My 10 year old son tried this for the first time a couple of weeks ago and loves it. He said it makes his teeth tingle and feel super clean. He loves the way it tastes. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> What a great product.  Received a sample from Smiley360 and was amazed at the slight mint taste!  The mint wasn&#x27;t overpowering.  A wonderful way for kids to feel like a grown up without having to use grown up toothpaste!  Definitely will buy!</li>
    <li> This is a great natural product for children! I&#x27;d recommend it! BTW: I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My 9yr old and 2yr old both loved the taste of the wicked cool. They brush longer and better with a toothpaste that they like. Awesome product. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I rec. a free sample to try from Smiley360 of Tom;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool Flouride toothpaste.  My kids love it!  I have purchased more since rec. the sample.  The most important thing that appeals to the children is the taste.  Not too \\&quot;hot\\&quot; for them!  It is not overly minty and has a great flavor for kids.  My biggest concern is the natural product which this is and also the fact that it is a flouride toothpaste.  I will be purchasing this again in the future!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the Tom&#x27;s WIcked Cool Mild Mint toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve been trying to find something she would like for quite a while.  She normally avoids any mint toothpaste, but not this one.  She loves it!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves using my toothpaste because she feels grown up (she&#x27;s 8) but she says it&#x27;s too \\&quot;spicy\\&quot; for her. With Tom&#x27;s Of Main Wicked Cool toothpaste and she have the same flavor of mine without it burning her mouth. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> They liked the light mint taste and I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any artificial sweeteners or dyes. I think we found them a new toothpaste! Recently I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360 to have my boys try out for them.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste isn&#x27;t bad. My son didn&#x27;t LOVE it and it doesn&#x27;t necessarily make him WANT to brush his teeth more than usual but he didn&#x27;t spit it out in disgust, either. I&#x27;d say it was successful. The mild mint flavor it getting him used to \\&quot;big boy\\&quot; toothpastes, which is a plus. :)</li>
    <li> We received a travel size sample of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool! Fluoride toothpaste through Smiley360.  My daughter snatched it up right away because she liked the coloring of the package.  I warned her that it may taste different than what she was used to and she should give it a couple of days.  A couple days later I asked her what she thought and she asked if she could get that kind instead of the bubble gum kids toothpaste she had been using.  She loved the mint flavor!</li>
    <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS TOOTHPASTE - GREAT NAME AND GREAT FLAVOR!  SHE WILL FINALLY BRUSH HER TEETH WITHOUT ME HAVING TO ASK!</li>
    <li> My daughter is very picky when it comes to toothpaste. She would prefer to use the baby toothpaste if I would allow it. Toms of Maine is the first product that is not too \\&quot;spicy\\&quot;. Will use again! \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My children tried the toothpaste and they really liked it, I was told it was the best, they have tried many different types but this one is cool in their mouths and not at all hot like some toothpaste and after words they love the way their mouths feel and how fresh their breath is.</li>
    <li> My 11-year-old hates to brush her teeth, but she didn&#x27;t mind because of the awesome flavor of this toothpaste. I also like the product because there are no unwanted chemicals.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the Toms of Maine toothpaste and, as a mom, I feel like its a wonderful alternative to all of the other brands. I received a free sample of Toms of Maine from 360 Smiley.</li>
    <li> My kids tried this and loved it!  It tasted so good and they looked forward to brushing their teeth!  How wonderful for a product to encourage my kids to brush their teeth....no more fights in my house!  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> I have 2 girls, and both of them have always wanted to try mom &amp; dad&#x27;s mint toothpaste, but quickly changed their minds as it went in their mouths. They would say that it burns and or stings. I was super excited for my girls to try the new Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste. They were getting tired really quickly of the bubble gum flavors (I personally can&#x27;t blame them). Once we got this in the mail, they tried it and LOVED it! They like the minty flavor, especially without the sting or burn. This is what we use all of the time now! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360]]]</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this toothpaste! She states that after brushing she felt like her teeth were clean. She likes the wicked cool flavor. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.  My 8 and 13 year old daughters tried it.  The 13 year old thought it wasn&#x27;t minty enough...while the 8 year old thought it was too strong.  (It must be just right then...) While the 8 year old wasn&#x27;t fond of the flavor, she did like how it made her breath smell fresh.  She even asked to use this toothpaste before school so her breath would smell good there.  I love how the product is natural and protects against cavities.  This toothpaste would be great for parents who want a natural toothpaste for their kids that protects against cavities.  This is a great option for kids who don&#x27;t like fruity toothpaste but find regular mint ones too strong.  My 8 year old is apparently not in that category yet...</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 9 year old son to try and he is not a big fan of mint. he said it was Tolerable but would not use it again. I tried it myself and thought it did a great job cleaning my teeth and it felt clean. I also liked the light mint taste. it was not too strong like some toothpastes. This would be good for kids who don&#x27;t mind a little bit of mint. But mine is stuck on the fruit flavored stuff for now. I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> i recieved this product on a Smiley360 mission. i had my 8 yr old nephew try it. he loved the flavor and wanted to brush multiple times throughout the day. great product!</li>
    <li> My three children were extremely excited to try this product! They all loved the taste and especially the packaging. I will continue to purchase Tom&#x27;s of Maine Natural Wicked Cool! Toothpaste!</li>
    <li> I am totally impressed with the Wicked Cool toothpaste for my kiddos from the Tom&#x27;s of Maine brand. My kids are picky about their toothpaste- they don&#x27;t want sweet toothpaste they think its weird to have a minty fruit flavor, and that don&#x27;t want strong Mint either. Well Toms of Maine is PERFECT!! My kids (ages 6,8 &amp; 12) FIGHT to use it! When do your kids fight over who gets to use the toothpaste first?? Let me guess ... Never! Well it is happening at My House! They LOVE the flavor- It makes them WANT To Brush! I know this sounds crazy- but I am totally impressed by this toothpaste cause of it! I will never go with-out again! I can also see it works since our recent dental check-up went perfect!&lt;br /&gt;I will mention I was skeptical to try \\&quot;another\\&quot; all Natural, better for you &amp; the planet product, because when it comes to \\&quot; Natural\\&quot; products I am always let down!! Either the item does not work as it should (like a cleaning product with no chemicals) or it has a funny, taste or bad smell. Well This is the one of only a handful of All-Natural Products that really works &amp; Tastes like it should! Way To GO TOMS, and Thank You for creating a toothpaste that my kids actually want to use that is NATURAL!!! \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> the taste is milder than usual paste and best is all natural. great for kids( got a free sample size tube from smiley360)</li>
    <li> I have really picky kids. They&#x27;re even picky about the flavor of their oral care products. So I was a little skeptical when I was given a free sample from Smiley360 to try. We&#x27;re definitely all for natural and organic foods and are using more natural cleaning products. But, I haven&#x27;t fully embraced using natural personal care products. Mostly because I find they don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let my 8-year-old daughter try the Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste this morning and surprisingly, she liked it! She didn&#x27;t mind the flavor at all and liked the name and packaging of the toothpaste. She liked that it was made for kids 8+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the toothpaste, too. I found it does indeed have a very mild mint flavor. It wasn&#x27;t strong enough for me. If I were to use this myself, I&#x27;d probably have to apply more toothpaste to my toothbrush halfway through brushing because it didn&#x27;t seem to lather as well as my normal toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall, I&#x27;d definitely buy it again for my kids. I like that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial dyes, flavors or sweeteners. Plus, it isn&#x27;t any more expensive than other toothpastes.</li>
    <li> My kids loved this toothpaste when we received it in the mail from Smiley360. My only complaint was there wasn&#x27;t enough. Great Job Tom&#x27;s of Maine!</li>
    <li> My kids loved this product, their friends even raved about it after a sleepover. would highly recommend this toothpaste.  Even my son who hates brushing his teeth didnt mind doing it with this toothpaste</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!((tm)) Toothpaste from Smiley360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We try to use as many natural products as possible in our daily routine, and when we got the chance to try Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool Toothpaste I was geeked. My son didn&#x27;t particularly care for the strength of adult toothpaste but was far from his kids toothpaste days. This was a chance for a medium that did the necessary cleaning with a milder taste and the requisite cavity fighting fluoride  filled content. But the most important factor was that it pass the kid test. My 8 year old and 14 year old used it, and from the first time they were sold. They appreciated that it was made specifically with them in mind, that the minty taste was mild, not overpowering like \\&quot;Mom&#x27;s\\&quot; toothpaste, and that it satisfied me, because it does the job that we aim for in keeping our kids dentistry on point. It costs more than what we were paying for the stronger stuff, but it is definitely worth the investment.</li>
    <li> My oldest Frugal was able to recently try Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the review from my oldest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I love the taste of the toothpaste.  It didn&#x27;t leave a nasty taste in my mouth and it had a good flavor.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind if my Mom continued to buy it\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is information from Tom&#x27;s of Maine&#x27;s website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEW Wicked Cool!(tm) fluoride toothpaste features a mild mint flavor for kids who have outgrown fruit or bubblegum flavors but don&#x27;t like the strong mint flavors found in many adult toothpastes. Wicked Cool! toothpaste is ADA-Accepted to help prevent cavities, and it also strengthens enamel and freshens breath.  And like all Tom&#x27;s kids toothpastes, it has no artificial dyes, sweeteners or flavors. We guarantee your older kids will love it or your money back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a parent, I really appreciate that it has no artificial ingredients!!  With the internet, it is so easy to become an informed parent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad we were able to review this product.  Tom&#x27;s of Maine will definitely be a brand of toothpaste that we will be buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My 7 year old daughter loved this. She took it on spring break with her and she wanted to brush her teeth every time she ate. Great product</li>
    <li> My kids liked it but thought it needed flavor like a fruity flavor or something but overally it helps thre teeth and its a reasonable price so i would probally repurchase it.\\&quot;I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>

    <li> I received a FREE sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked cool! from Smiley 360 and my 11 was quite impressed! At times adult toothpaste can be too strong and the younger kids toothpaste is too fruity or bubble gum. This was a nice light mint flavor which left a refreshed clean mouth!</li>
    <li> I had my 11 year old daughter try this toothpaste and she absolutely loved it.  She said that the mint flavor was great and that it was not too strong and didn&#x27;t burn like some of the mint flavors that we have tried in the past.  She said that her mouth felt really clean.  I like the fact that it is natural and does not contain artificial ingredients.  I am so happy that I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.  We will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this product from Smiley360 for my son. He is at the age he is beginning to use normal toothpaste, but thinks it all tastes too &#x27;spicy&#x27;. He really liked Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool. It&#x27;s not too intense for him, and there are no complaints during teeth brushing time.</li>
    <li> My daughter received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Main Natural Wicked Cool toothpaste from Smiley360.com and she loves it. She had been trying to use my toothpaste for a while now because she had gotten tired of all the fruity flavors and bubble gum that were available for children. I wanted her to still have children&#x27;s toothpaste and the mint flavor in strong for her in adults so when I saw this I jumped at the chance to try it out. She is 8 years old and loves the minty taste. After this I had to purchase a tube and she enjoys brushing her teeth now.</li>
    <li> We recieved a sample of this toothpaste from Smiley360. Overall my kids really liked it. It wasn&#x27;t too minty for them. The only complaint I received from my kids was that they thought it would be colorful and fruity flavored by just looking at the packaging. So they were a little surprised that it was minty and white.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of the Tom&#x27;s of Maine \\&quot;Wicked Cool\\&quot; toothpaste from Smiley 360 for my daughter try. She loved the Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste; she liked the flavor and that it wasn&#x27;t \\&quot;too hot\\&quot;. She brushed longer and her teeth whitened with continued usage.  I told several of my friends about this toothpaste, and they tried it for their children. Several of them thanked me for sharing this product with them.  They also saw a difference in the appearance of their children&#x27;s teeth.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this toothpaste from Smiley360, and my children absolutely loved it! It has a really great taste!</li>

    <li> I received a sample tube of Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool toothpaste from smiley360 for my 11 year old son to try out.  Now I am sure I am not the only mother here that has to remind their kid to brush..some days I have to beg my son to do it.  When he tried it the first time he came out smiling.  I asked him what he liked about it and he loves the mint flavor telling me it doesn&#x27;t make my mouth hot.  I waited to review until he was finished with the tube and I am happy to report he brushes twice a day without anyone telling him to.  I am all for any product that makes kids want to do things they should.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is amazing! NO more fighting with my son to brush his teeth.His complaint was that toothpaste was \\&quot;HOT\\&quot; on his tongue and guns. This is perfect!!</li>
    <li> My 10-yr-old daughter has outgrown the kiddie toothpaste and their sweet flavors, but she didn&#x27;t really like the stronger minty flavor of any adult toothpaste I&#x27;ve bought for her to try. I am a member of smiley360.com, a site that will send you FREE samples (or even full size products) to try and then share your experiences with. The items received often come with very good, high value coupons to use &amp; to share with your friends and family. I received a FREE tube of Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste for my daughter to try out. My daughter absolutely LOVES this toothpaste she was able to try through my smiley360.com account. And I love that she brushes regularly! I really like also that Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked Cool toothpaste contains flouride. I will definitely be buying this toothpaste from now on &amp; I will be passing down several unopened tubes of Aquafresh Kids toothpaste (that I stocked up on during a good sale) to my sister who has younger kids who will use it! :0)</li>
    <li> I received this product for testing and reviewing purposes from Smiley360, and it was a hit with my son. He was still using bubble gum flavored toothpaste and to me it doesn&#x27;t give that clean fresh breath feeling. Well my son loved the bottle design and so he tried it. He loved the minty taste and said that his teeth felt cleaner. I&#x27;m glad he liked it, because I had no idea how many chemical were actually in regular and children&#x27;s toothpaste. I will be purchasing this product from here on out, and it is not more expensive than other brands we use. \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> My daughter used to HATE mint toothpaste and would only use the fruity kinds. I received a free sample of Toms of Maine Wicked Cool! Toothpaste and it is now the only kind of toothpaste she will use. It has just a hint of mint, so its not over powering! And it is all natural, can&#x27;t go wrong!! I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360</li>
    <li> received this as a sample from smiley360, My child liked it much better than the toothpaste that my husband and I used. Its a great combination of child and adult toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This Product is great for kids that might not like a strong flavored toothpaste. The light mint flavor gives just enough to freshen breath and keep your child&#x27;s mouth clean. My 8 year old son really enjoys this product. At only $2.99 a tube, it is worth giving it a try.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool! Toothpaste For Kids 8+ from smiley360.  My 3 kids all really loved this toothpaste. My youngest daughter, who is 8, usually puts up a fuss with toothpastes and is very picky.  She does not like it if they are \\&quot;too minty\\&quot; or if they \\&quot;burn\\&quot;.  She LOVED Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked cool and it is now her favorite.  No more complaining or forgetting to brush!  My other daughters told me that Tom&#x27;s of Maine Wicked cool toothpaste tasted much better than our usual brand.  All three of them thought the tube was prettier than other toothpastes and geared towards kids.  I really liked how it is made with natural ingredients and has no artificial dyes, flavors, or sweeteners.</li>
    <li> Both my kids 11 and 12 years tried this toothpaste.  They both thought the tooth paste had a very mild mint flavor, but they both preferred other brands that we have used in the past.  I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> My son was so excited about this he loves the taste and it made him want to brush. I love it cause its all natural and prevents cavities!!</li>
    <li> Our 12 year old son tried this out while we were on a weekend getaway and he loved it!! He wants us to make sure we purchase this in the future for him to use.</li>
    <li> My 11 yr old son doesn&#x27;t like the strong mint flavor of regular toothpaste but found this to be perfect. His teeth were clean, breath fresh and he even put the cap back on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Smiley360 for the chance to review this product.</li>
    <li> Way too minty for claiming to be mild. My 8 yr old daughter tried this toothpaste many times and couldn&#x27;t keep it in her mouth long enough to do a thorough brushing. It is nice to know this toothpaste has plenty of good qualities like no dyes or unnatural ingredients while still providing the best qualities of regular toothpaste. But the flavor is just a little too minty for daughter. Luckily we were able to try it for free. Because I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!™ Toothpaste from Smiley360.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so hard trying to find a toothpaste that my kids will like. My 13 year old is tooo old for the \\&quot;kid kind\\&quot; and he says the ones that we use \\&quot;burn his tongue\\&quot;! So we have gone through several different brands trying to find the right toothpaste.. I think we have finally found that in Tom&#x27;s Wicked Cool!!! (whew)He loves it!!&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely be buying it again!!!</li>
    <li> My kids loved this toothpaste.  They said it tasted great and was not too minty!  I will definetly continue to have my kids use this product.  I received a free sample from smiley360!</li>
    <li> we got this as free sample. and my kids were really happy to try something new. they loved it so much I have not had to ask them to brush their teeth and are excited to wake up and go to bed just to brush their teeth.</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this product and neither my 16 year old or my 9 year old are big fans of it. The 9 year old says the mint taste is very light so you almost have no flavor but she uses it anyway.</li>
    <li> Natural and worry free</li>
    <li> I got this toothpaste for my 6 year old to try. I was lured to it because it is all natural. Buying as much all natural products as I can makes me feel better about what my kids put in their bodies but this toothpaste didn&#x27;t pass the test for my son. He doesn&#x27;t like the taste and prefers his old toothpaste over it. Maybe your child will feel different about it. It&#x27;s defiantly worth trying as all kids have their own tastes. I received a free sample of the NEW Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste for Kids 8+ from Smiley360. :)</li>
    <li> \\&quot;I received a free sample of Tom&#x27;s of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.\\&quot;  My children enjoyed the new flavor.  The toothpaste was very kid friendly!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tooth paste. It&#x27;s slightly minty. Kids will like it if they like mint. If a kid will brush because they have special kid&#x27;s toothpaste, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> My son liked that the tooth paste wasn&#x27;t too strong like some other tooth paste.  He said there could have been more flavor and that his teeth didn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample from smiley360, and I must admit I was a bit skepitcal at using a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; paste, however I was wrong! Even though this product is intended for kids I used it myself, as an adult my mouth felt clean , and my 9 year old, who shies away from things that are \\&quot;hot\\&quot; approved! Nice toothpaste.</li>
