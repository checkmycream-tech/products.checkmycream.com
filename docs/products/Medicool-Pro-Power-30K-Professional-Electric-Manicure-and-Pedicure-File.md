      <li>The power and control offered by the drill makes me more confident in my work.</li>
      <li>I am not too  pleased with this manicure/pedicure file.</li>
      <li>I just moved to the States from Germany, where I was used to getting pecidures with top knotch machinery in a sterile environment.  </li>
      <li>MY clients love it,also</li>
      <li>but I love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I choose this model with the locking chuck as I have more control of the bit with the wand.</li>
      <li>What more can you say  </li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>If I used it for 8 hours a day perhaps I would be ok with it.</li>
      <li>so I will update again after I become more familiar with it.  </li>
      <li>blew up with smoke as soon as i switched it on, no drill bits in the box, would have been more useful if it were more informative</li>
      <li>My Order was quickly processed and received!</li>
      <li>I have little hands &amp; it fits perfectly in them</li>
      <li>This drill is fantastic.</li>

      <li>Shipped right away too :)</li>
      <li>I have a small beauty business  and that fits my needs perfectly  </li>
      <li>Other than that everything seems good!</li>
      <li>Drill has more power than I need but more is better than not enough!!</li>
      <li>The drill itself is super light.</li>
      <li>Also, it distributes cool air over the handpiece while running to keep your hand cool.  </li>
      <li>2nd one we&#x27;ve bought and it does a good job.  </li>
      <li>Thank you for shipping it out so quickly.</li>
      <li>The machine does not have a vacuum, like the German ones that takes away the foot powder, but for the money, this machine is just what I wanted and produces excellent pedicures.  </li>
      <li>So far, it work&#x27;s great, smooth and quiet.</li>
      <li>This is a great little nail dremmel.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this to any nail tech looking for an amazing drill to use.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money..</li>
      <li>Works like a CHAMP AND WORTH THE INVESTMENT.  </li>
      <li>She needed another one right away</li>
      <li>My original drill went out and i quickly needed a new one.</li>
      <li>It is much more powerful and quiet than my kupa mani pro.</li>
      <li>or it gets noisy and hot.</li>
      <li>I have used many different kinds of files and</li>
      <li>The price was great considering that if I bought it from a beauty supply I would have paid at least $350 if it was on sale.  </li>
      <li>and you were able to get the new one to me so quickly that she only had to use one of the schools for a day.  </li>
      <li>Love it and highly Recomended for profesional or personal use.</li>
      <li>The plug that Connect&#x27;s the drill hand piece to the drill is loose so it will be interesting to see if it stays working.</li>
      <li>Little to no hand vibration which can cause hand to fall asleep while using.. lite weight and easy to keep clean.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s quit and works fast.  </li>
      <li>and I can keep my feet neat and clean all year round and enjoy wearing my sandals in the summer.</li>
      <li>Two other people I work with have been using the same model and are also very satisfied with it.  </li>
      <li>The first time my husband fixed.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s as though they want you to buy a whole new unit every time you need a replacement part.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>and I may have to buy a complete file attachment which is very costly.</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with my new drill same one I bought a few years ago but saved about one hundred dollars</li>
      <li>and it still runs like new.</li>
      <li>The first one for me and the second one for my friend.</li>
      <li>am a professional Nail Tech (@talishasnailart)</li>
      <li>I just got it early April 2015</li>
      <li>and I like it so far.  </li>
      <li>The bigger bit that came with it seemed to not remove much gel; like you&#x27;d have to work on it for a while.  </li>
      <li>Other than that its quiet and cool for my hand.</li>
      <li>Sadly more money wasted as this new unit had the same problem and the file stopped working after a few uses.  </li>
      <li>I got a fungus once, in the States, and I refuse to go back to the old technology of unsanitary tools and pumice stones used in public pedicure salons.  </li>
      <li>The lustre and shine quality of my art is now complete, the oration one receives working the craft with such engineered genius can only astound!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I absolutely LOVE this nail drill!  It is very quiet with virtually no vibration.  Also, it distributes cool air over the handpiece while running to keep your hand cool.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The drill is so quiet. It&#x27;s easy to use and I loved the instructional DVD. Drill has more power than I need but more is better than not enough!!</li>
    <li> the best drill I have owned... highly recommend</li>
    <li> Received this October 7 2014 and is already broke! And I have no way of getting a hold of the company.</li>
    <li> I just moved to the States from Germany, where I was used to getting pecidures with top knotch machinery in a sterile environment.  I got a fungus once, in the States, and I refuse to go back to the old technology of unsanitary tools and pumice stones used in public pedicure salons.  The Medicool Pro Power 30K professional electric pedicure file is the perfect solution.  The machine does not have a vacuum, like the German ones that takes away the foot powder, but for the money, this machine is just what I wanted and produces excellent pedicures.  I ordered the interchangable tips for doing heels, toe nails, etc.  Now my feet look and feel as good as they did in Germany when I got professional pedicures.  I am so happy to have it and I can keep my feet neat and clean all year round and enjoy wearing my sandals in the summer.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I have never been more happy with a purchase before. This item is well built and works absolutely great.</li>
    <li> This is supposed to be a professional grade tool but stopped working after only a few uses. Bearings in file tool need to be replaced but the motor still works. Hard to find replacement parts online and I may have to buy a complete file attachment which is very costly. Dissapointed. Update: I couldn&#x27;t find a file to buy and bought another unit out of necessity. Sadly more money wasted as this new unit had the same problem and the file stopped working after a few uses.  I bought both units on amazon but contacted medicool directly several times to buy replacement files and was only given the run around. It&#x27;s as though they want you to buy a whole new unit every time you need a replacement part. That&#x27;s it for me and medicool products!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product for the price. Little to no hand vibration which can cause hand to fall asleep while using.. lite weight and easy to keep clean.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement item for my daughter.  She is a nail technician student and the one she was given in her case at school stopped working.  She needed another one right away and you were able to get the new one to me so quickly that she only had to use one of the schools for a day.  Thank you for shipping it out so quickly.</li>
    <li> This nail drill is amazing. Works perfect for at home acrylics! Make sure to use canned air to dust inside of the machine...gets alot of nail dust build up.</li>
    <li> blew up with smoke as soon as i switched it on, no drill bits in the box, would have been more useful if it were more informative&lt;br /&gt;as i would probably would have to had to waited longer to re-order the bits</li>
    <li> Great Product!  I have used many different kinds of files and this by far is the best.  NO PROBLEMS!!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This the best nail filing system I&#x27;ve had this now for five years and it still runs like new.</li>
    <li> This is the second one i ordert. The first one for me and the second one for my friend. Is for personal use but I love it. Hand peace dosent over head and it&#x27;s just perfect if you need it for work. Love it and highly Recomended for profesional or personal use.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product. Not hot to the touch and no vibration. Easy to use!</li>
    <li> Came on time! In good condition. The plug that Connect&#x27;s the drill hand piece to the drill is loose so it will be interesting to see if it stays working. Other than that everything seems good!</li>
    <li> It has a foot pedal that can only be on or off. I wish that it has a variable speed for foot pedal. Other than that its quiet and cool for my hand.</li>
    <li> I have a small beauty business  and that fits my needs perfectly  I would recommend this item  to every one  it is every well made  affordable and  looks like it will last</li>
    <li> I purchase this two years ago, and today it died. If I used it for 8 hours a day perhaps I would be ok with it. But this isn&#x27;t the case. I had just graduated from school and had no clients for awhile. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money..</li>
    <li> I love it.  It&#x27;s quit and works fast.  What more can you say  My other drill I had for 16 years, was dental quality,( It  became obscure for a tune up) but for the price difference of over $600.oo I don&#x27;t plan on dying in the chair.  I&#x27;ve done this job for over40 year,I&#x27;m just about done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. MY clients love it,also</li>
    <li> This is a great little nail dremmel.  2nd one we&#x27;ve bought and it does a good job.  Got to blow out the dust every once in a while or it gets noisy and hot.</li>
    <li> This drill is fantastic. I have been doing nails for 20 years.  The price was great considering that if I bought it from a beauty supply I would have paid at least $350 if it was on sale.  Two other people I work with have been using the same model and are also very satisfied with it.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this drill.  No vibration, no heat even at top speed! I have been very happy with all my medicool drills, this one however is by far the best.  I have missed the locking chuck, with then last drill I had a mechanical chuck and I never trusted it, it ended up loosening up after a year and I had to send it back to Medicool.  I&#x27;m glad I choose this model with the locking chuck as I have more control of the bit with the wand.</li>
    <li> I just got it early April 2015 and I like it so far.  I am not a professional and have never used a drill like this before.  It only came with 2 bits.  I am learning how to do my own UV Gel nails so I will update again after I become more familiar with it.  I want to list what is all included with this unit.  The motor box, Foot pedal which clicks on and off - it&#x27;s not a graduated push and release, Micro Motor Hand piece, Hand piece cradle, Power Cord, Clear plastic bit box with two silver metal bits, Instructional DVD, Warranty Post Card, 8-1/2 x 11 single sided instruction sheet, long colored order form to order many different bits, paper slip explaining how to blow air into hand piece to remove dust, little clear baggie with 1 fuse and two little things that look like tiny copper rectangles attached to tiny spring with little silver metal cubes at the other end of the springs (sorry don&#x27;t know what that is) and what I believe to be a flat, metal cut out tool maybe to open up the hand piece or box to change the fuse or something?  It&#x27;s 30,000 RPM&#x27;s, 120 or 220 Volts, Forward and Reverse direction, 6 oz hand piece.  USB X000LJOJ7L.  The bigger bit that came with it seemed to not remove much gel; like you&#x27;d have to work on it for a while.  I need to get emery and other bits.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE!!!!!!! I have little hands &amp; it fits perfectly in them &amp; I don&#x27;t feel intimidated by a drill. Lol I feel this drill is totally worth it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional Nail Tech (@talishasnailart) and I have used this drill for 3 years now with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this drill to EVERYONE!</li>
    <li> So far, it work&#x27;s great, smooth and quiet. One of the workers had one for 3 years and it still works great. No problems yet.</li>
    <li> Great for a seasoned tech.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this drill for a nonprofessional.</li>
    <li> I am not too  pleased with this manicure/pedicure file. I am the only one to use it. However its been broken twice. The first time my husband fixed. Now I can&#x27;t use it because the file hook it is stock and doesn&#x27;t come out. I have not been avale to change the file.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my new drill same one I bought a few years ago but saved about one hundred dollars</li>
    <li> Otherwise the file works well.  It would have been nice too see their tips and suggestions on a CD though.</li>
    <li> Manicuring for days!  The lustre and shine quality of my art is now complete, the oration one receives working the craft with such engineered genius can only astound!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with any mandrel heads. But beautiful and works AMAZING.  The drill itself is super light.</li>
    <li> My original drill went out and i quickly needed a new one. My Order was quickly processed and received! Very pleased!</li>
    <li> It is much more powerful and quiet than my kupa mani pro. The only thing I don&#x27;t like, is when I reverse it, it makes a high pitched whining sound that is very annoying.</li>
    <li> The power and control offered by the drill makes me more confident in my work. I would definitely recommend this to any nail tech looking for an amazing drill to use.</li>
    <li> Works like a CHAMP AND WORTH THE INVESTMENT.  Shipped right away too :)</li>
