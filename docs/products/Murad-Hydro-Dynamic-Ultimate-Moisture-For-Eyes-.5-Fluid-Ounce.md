      <li>This is the best eye cream I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product one of the best moisturizers I have ever used for a great price</li>
      <li>I recommend you will be delighted.....</li>
      <li>Great job moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy when I put concealer on top.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Undereye concealer glides on nicely over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the best match for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It is okay.  </li>
      <li>Moisturizes my eye area, you can even put a light amount on your eyelids!  </li>
      <li>I tried many different eye creams and this one works the best for me.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, most of them have not done what they said.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any issues applying an eye makeup primer and makeup over the top.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>I just love this cream, have been using it for a week now and can already see a difference, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it leaves my eyes feeling so smooth</li>
      <li>and my eyes are fine now.  </li>
      <li>The texture is thicker than I&#x27;m used to and feels quite rich when applied to the skin.</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this Murad eye product since I&#x27;d heard good things about the brand in general.</li>
      <li>Great for dry eyelids</li>
      <li>The cream should be bright white in color.</li>
      <li>My skin has become so sensitive and dry as I&#x27;ve aged that having an exceptionally hydrating cream with no chemicals is perfect for me.</li>
      <li>I love it even more in the winter since I use to have dry patches.</li>
      <li>More importantly, my skin has reacted to several of them.  </li>
      <li>first impressions were that true to its name, this is moisturizing.</li>
      <li>This is the only moisturizer that I own and tried that is NOT OILY.</li>
      <li>Just as you would expect from only using a moisturizer --there is no change in how my face appears (wrinkle-wise), but it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this eye cream has the potential to be great, just for someone who doesn&#x27;t have a reaction to the specific ingredients in this product.</li>
      <li>Even from the first use I felt a lot of the dryness and itchy feeling</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m generally used to a much thinner, more lightweight cream.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy it again though ! :)</li>
      <li>Because of the burning, I prefer the aforementioned Shiseido product over this because the moisturizing benefits seemed on par but it felt more gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great moisturizer and a great undereye base for makeup !!</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing eye cream</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>From the very beginning, I have acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>My second purchase and can only say good things; I have sensitive skin and this never causes irritation.  </li>
      <li>A little goes a long way which makes me feel better about the price. :)</li>
      <li>there are no anti-aging properties, no secret ingredients, no rare elements that will magically make you 30 again.  </li>
      <li>And also because I&#x27;ve been trying a few eye creams lately to try to find the ultimate one that will be the best for my unique concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Now, let me make clear...</li>
      <li>, I have a problem with eye creams because my eyes are sensitive but</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive eyes and skin, try it.</li>
      <li>Used many different eye creams and spent about $1000 at eye doctors and trying different medications.  </li>
      <li>I could see where this might be overkill in the summer months or in a more humid climate, but when the dry winter winds are blowing it makes my delicate eye skin feel very pampered and protected.</li>
      <li>Accordingly, an eye cream for me is more about prevention, creating a solid canvas for when I apply eye makeup, and dealing with other eye related issues like puffiness and dullness (particularly after a long night out).</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry skin around my eyes and need to moisturize it daily.</li>
      <li>Obviously everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently so just because this gave mine a burning sensation doesn&#x27;t mean it will do the same for everyone, but if your skin is typically sensitive I think it is worth trying a sample before committing to a whole container to make sure it doesn&#x27;t give your skin a bad reaction or buying from somewhere that has a generous return policy for open and used beauty items.</li>

<li> It was quite unpleasant.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Very moisturizing eye cream</li>
    <li> I just love this cream, have been using it for a week now and can already see a difference, it&#x27;s not greasy at all, it leaves my eyes feeling so smooth, I have a problem with eye creams because my eyes are sensitive but no irritation at all....I recommend you will be delighted.....</li>
    <li> It is okay.  It actually stings my eyes.</li>
    <li> My second purchase and can only say good things; I have sensitive skin and this never causes irritation.  Other moisturizers sometimes even caused break outs in the dry winter months, never had this issue with this one!</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream that I have ever used. I use it for under eye area and on my lids. I have normal to dry skin around my eyes and need to moisturize it daily. I tried many different eye creams and this one works the best for me.</li>
    <li> This is the best eye cream I have ever used.  It keeps the tissue around my eyes hydrated all day, I have had dryness around my eyes since I became 40. I can&#x27;t do without this product! Love it!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff</li>
    <li> Excellent product one of the best moisturizers I have ever used for a great price</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer and a great undereye base for makeup !! But that is all what it is, you should keep that in mind. I will definitely buy it again though ! :)</li>
    <li> It is creamy and healed my eye lids from dryness, puffiness and redness. I use a lot of oil controlling products on my face because I am acne prone this is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> Great for dry eyelids</li>
    <li> I like the texture. Just as you would expect from only using a moisturizer --there is no change in how my face appears (wrinkle-wise), but it&#x27;s a nice product. The product doesn&#x27;t make my eyes sting like a lot of moisturizers do. However, there is the occasional time I do notice a stinging and that&#x27;s usually if I rub my skin a bit too much around the eyes during cleansing. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll buy it again. I&#x27;ll likely try a different product.</li>
    <li> This product arrived on time as promised, but the cream was yellow and looked like mayonnaise that was out too long.  The cream should be bright white in color.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You notice a difference after just a few days!</li>
    <li> I think I have tried every skin care line for anti-aging and dry skin.  Unfortunately, most of them have not done what they said.  More importantly, my skin has reacted to several of them.  After a particularly bad reaction to a new  moisturizer, my doctor recommended Murad.  Now, let me make clear...there are no anti-aging properties, no secret ingredients, no rare elements that will magically make you 30 again.  For me, that works.  My skin has become so sensitive and dry as I&#x27;ve aged that having an exceptionally hydrating cream with no chemicals is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> Great job moisturizing, doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes, doesn&#x27;t get clumpy when I put concealer on top. A little goes a long way which makes me feel better about the price. :)</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Moisturizes my eye area, you can even put a light amount on your eyelids!  I had dry, red, itchy eyes for years.  Used many different eye creams and spent about $1000 at eye doctors and trying different medications.  Switched to Murad HD Eye and my eyes are fine now.  This product must be super-hypoallergenic or something, it&#x27;s not like any other cream.  If you have sensitive eyes and skin, try it.</li>
    <li> From the very beginning, I have acne prone skin. Suffered from acne since middle school. I seriously don&#x27;t know how it went away but ever since it did, I&#x27;m very picky with what I use on my face so it doesn&#x27;t come back. This is the only moisturizer that I own and tried that is NOT OILY. My face does not shine within 24 hours of use. I love it even more in the winter since I use to have dry patches. Gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God for this invention. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 31 (soon to be 32) and thankfully aging concerns are not a huge issue with my eyes -- yet. Accordingly, an eye cream for me is more about prevention, creating a solid canvas for when I apply eye makeup, and dealing with other eye related issues like puffiness and dullness (particularly after a long night out). I was excited to try this Murad eye product since I&#x27;d heard good things about the brand in general. And also because I&#x27;ve been trying a few eye creams lately to try to find the ultimate one that will be the best for my unique concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions were that true to its name, this is moisturizing. The texture is thicker than I&#x27;m used to and feels quite rich when applied to the skin. I&#x27;m generally used to a much thinner, more lightweight cream. As it is now February and very cold and dry in Chicago the thickness of the cream is a plus for me. I could see where this might be overkill in the summer months or in a more humid climate, but when the dry winter winds are blowing it makes my delicate eye skin feel very pampered and protected. Even from the first use I felt a lot of the dryness and itchy feeling I can get in this area was relieved. That said, it isn&#x27;t the richest feeling cream I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d give those honors to Shiseido Benefiance Concentrated Anti-Wrinkle Eye Cream 15ml/0.51oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how well this works under makeup. I didn&#x27;t have any issues applying an eye makeup primer and makeup over the top. I still found that I was getting the same long wear I&#x27;ve come to expect out of my eye makeup and didn&#x27;t find that it pilled or made other makeup products apply unevenly. Undereye concealer glides on nicely over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for anti-aging benefits, for me it&#x27;s been too soon to tell (and is made especially difficult by the fact I&#x27;m using this more for prevent signs of aging rather than repair it). I do think it makes the skin around my eyes look brighter and healthier. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen any noticeable difference in the appearance of my fine lines, though they are quite subtle at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didn&#x27;t like about this cream, and it&#x27;s a big one, is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the best match for my sensitive skin. I sometimes experience a little stinging with eye creams and other various beauty products, but this one made my skin burn on application. It was quite unpleasant. I&#x27;m guessing that means I had a bad reaction to one of the ingredients in the eye cream, though it&#x27;s hard to isolate which one.
