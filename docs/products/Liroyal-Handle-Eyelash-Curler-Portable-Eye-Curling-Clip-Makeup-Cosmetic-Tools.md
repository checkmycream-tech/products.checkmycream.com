<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It does the job but I find myself recurling my lashes throughout the day constantly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many eyelash curlers and this is one of my favorites.  It is extremely gentle.  I love the pink grips.  They are so much better than the comparable metal grips.  Amazon presented the product well.  It was packaged well and arrived in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> Does the job without breaking or pulling , great value easy grip would recommend highly to anyone good good buy</li>
    <li> SODIAL(TM) Curling Eyelashes-Nature Curl Style Cute Curl Eyelash Curlers Pink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this eyelash curler! Money well spent.I have never owned or even used an eyelash curler before but this one was so easy to use and figure out.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get here and was so big and clunky I couldn&#x27;t use them on my eye.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> It took forever to deliver and although it&#x27;s a steal and a good price, I&#x27;m worried it&#x27;ll break. Anyways thanks for the product though.</li>
    <li> This item was listed as NEW.  It was not in original packaging when it came.  It was only in an envelope and was so filthy, I immediately threw it away.  It was obviously used with old makeup caked on it and flaking off.  It extremely disgusted and disappointed me!</li>
    <li> Love the curler works super well</li>
    <li> I like the curler a lot. It works well, and it&#x27;s small enough to go anywhere. I ALWAYS have this in my purse.</li>
    <li> I guess the fact that I don&#x27;t have any eyebrows could add to the reason why the rating is so low..</li>
    <li> I love them it definitely helped my eyelashes that are curled the wrong way if you have the same issue buy this</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to rate items poorly, but this one is an exception. If I could rate this product with a zero, I would. This curler came to me in this condition: the box was bent up, the curler itself was all bent and wouldn&#x27;t fit to anyone eye even if you had the smallest eyes in the world. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I love them! The grips are comfortable as well</li>
    <li> I got them really fast.love the color love the way it feels in my hand very good I love it !</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really nice, works well, and came quickly also very reasonably priced! I would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend!</li>
    <li> it was only 1 dollar and a few cents it came its sturdy it does what it suppose to do im glad no complaints thus far</li>
    <li> I love the pink coat, it is nice to have and doesnt hurt, and it makes my lashes longg!! Very nice.</li>
    <li> I hate giving products low reviews, but this one is necessary. I paid only $3 for this curler so I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. It is terrible! It only comes with one pad and the pad is so low and flat. The top part is fairly sharp. I tried it on some of my hairs and after seeing them be cut off, I decided not to use it on my lashes. It also squeaks.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, invest in a shu uemura. Or, buy an ELF curler.</li>
    <li> This is just ok, gets the job done. I didn&#x27;t know it was coming from China, or the packaging would be in Chinese, so it did take a good couple weeks before It arrived in the mail. It does curl my lashes pretty well so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Dont waste ur money. I know it wasnt much but may as well just throw a dollar in the trash. Cause that is what this is... trash. We were looking for something to add so we would qualify for free shipping. Lol</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my wife.  I can not comment on &amp;#34;quality&amp;#34; as this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen these, but if it helps it does not feel as strong as the average fingernail/nose-hair scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to open the package for two things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It was marked as &amp;#34;Cell phone accessories&amp;#34; in the description on the postage label&lt;br /&gt;2.  It came from Hong Kong, although the actual shipping &amp; handling fees when purchased were quite small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package lightly protected envelope, the scissors were poorly wrapped in what looked like someone ripped a shred of pink bubble wrap and fashioned it in a way to only cover the exposed metal portion (I&#x27;m not exaggerating).  Picture a lollypop, and that&#x27;s exactly what I was looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, my wife has yet to use it or complain about it.  It takes a little time to get to arrive, so be patient.</li>
    <li> Very small, my eyelashes are long and this is too small! Really cute though!</li>
    <li> only product that worked and I am happy with.  thank you for the wonderful eyelash curler.  good good good good</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like at first but it works great so now I love it I use it all the time?</li>
    <li> this was GREAT! totally recommend it</li>
    <li> Forget the low price, this is the one for you. Forget the negative comments. I have had not one problem with mine. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll regret this item at all. It does come from China and takes a while to get to you but it will be well worth it for the price. I have no regrets at all. A really good deal!,</li>
    <li> so cute !!! works perfect for me !!!!!!  i would buy more of these w.e i need it toatally great</li>
    <li> Right when I got this, I didn&#x27;t want to put it anywhere near my eyelids to be honest. The seller is great though. But the curler is flimsy and cheap and stickyish. My sister asked if she could have it and I didn&#x27;t hesitiate to say yes! Just gave it two stars though because it curls somewhat, but shipping was too long, even for hong kong, it was flimsy and cheap looking almost as if it would break any second, and it was somewhat sticky. I would suggest going to a local Target and getting a E.L.F. eyelash curler for only one dollar! It works great and by a trusted brand.</li>
    <li> I bought this from Warm Mart and it look awhile to get to the Eastern part of the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was not as bad as I thought. It was pretty sturdy despite the other comments about the quality of the product. However, I have super short eye lashes and it was too scared to use it because it felt like I was pushing my eyeballs backwards. (I have puffy eyes and super short eye lashes really don&#x27;t help. It was my first time trying it...well...I attempted to try it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was kind of a waste of money though since I was too scared to use it. However, when my mom used it, her eyelashes did curl! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the fact that the seller wrapped the item in bubble wrap and tape. It took a very long time to unwrap the clear duct tape. But that&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> They seem to be sturdy and well-made.&lt;br /&gt;Pink is her FAV color and she asked for eyelash curlers among other things.</li>
    <li> s***, not worth the 99cents I paid</li>
    <li> This product was amazing for its price! Typical eyelash curler, and it arrived early. I love the color and I would highly recommend this product to anyone in search of an affordable eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> It curls lashes very quickly and efficiently and I use it every day!!! All my friends noticed right away when I started using it and they all loved the way I used it!</li>
    <li> Awful quality! I am sorry that such a defective item  bought!! :(( I hope in the future I will not allow such an error</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, it is easy to use and I use it whenever I do my makeup. However the pad thing is only on the bottom and it can curl your lashes weird if you don&#x27;t use it right.</li>
    <li> The quality of the curler is much lower than i expected and does NOT do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I was exited when i received it but when after i opened it and tried to use it, I found out the shape was just not right. It doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used 1 eyelash curler since I started curling my eyelashes at 14yrs old, and it was a Cover Girl brand. Cover Girl stopped making that particular brand, and I couldn&#x27;t find any replacement rubber things for it either. Anyways I bought this one, the SODIAL, and was quiet suprised at my results. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and nothing had compared to my cover girl curler,  until now. So in my opinion,  they are actually better than my last one. Great quality,  for a great price</li>
    <li> This item took a long time to get here but i guess it came before it said it would. It&#x27;s really cheap so i got what I paid for it. It pulled my lashes out so I jus took of the pad n put it in my old lash curler. Glad I didn&#x27;t throw it away.</li>
    <li> This product is really amazing, I just love it. I have had it for a little more than 2 years now and it hasn&#x27;t broken or messed up.</li>
    <li> I love it, but i have to learn how to use one, never used on before now, the product is easy to use and makes my lashes look awesome, even without mascara, thanks</li>
    <li> Just like the headline says. This product was ok not great or fantastc just ok. Took quite awhile to get here. Doesnt curl my lashes the way I like. Makes it hard to put on mascara. Curls them upwards way to much.</li>
    <li> The pads are very sticky and pull out my lashes.  The pad also does not fit into the curler well and falls out very easily.  I&#x27;m wishing I would&#x27;ve spent a few more dollars for a better curler.</li>
    <li> Amazing! 10x better than my last curling iron, they really curl!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d seen people complain that this isn&#x27;t fancy, or doesn&#x27;t work miracles. Well, the truth is this: it is the average eyelash curler; it curls your lashes by squeezing. It works fine. There is nothing wrong with it, and it was new and in good shape when I got it. You honestly can&#x27;t expect more than a plain jane curler for just a couple dollars. It is exactly as expected.</li>
    <li> These are nowhere near as good as any eyelash curler you could buy at a drugstore.  It may be less expensive, but it&#x27;s really not worth it.</li>
    <li> great price works well</li>
    <li> works relatively well for the price and arrived on time (hilariously, in a gigantic package)</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Best than the revlon i bought for $8</li>
    <li> These work great an for an amazing price !! I recommend to every girl out there. Dont go spending 10-20 bucks this works just as good if not better !! Get it !!</li>
    <li> Got this today in the mail and it works great. I was hesitant to try them out, because I don&#x27;t want to lose the little lashes I have, lol. The sponge is so soft, and none of my eyelashes came out, yay!!</li>
    <li> It came late but its ok for the use..</li>
    <li> Good and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This item is made very poorly, the pieces were put on crooked and so it doesn&#x27;t close all the way and doesn&#x27;t do what it is intended to. Very disappointed because I love the hot pink!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler!! I&#x27;ve tried two other brands (Revlon and Lancôme) and they just do not come close to these! It&#x27;s just the perfect size and the perfect price. How can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> saw a you tube video on how to use this item and i couldn&#x27;t wait to give it a try. plus its pink!</li>
    <li> took a loooooong time to get here and doesn&#x27;t have enough padding in it to actually grab the lashes and curl them! I guess u get what u pay for!</li>
    <li> have super long lashes, need a bigger curler, guess i will use it for my back up. cute though. Florentina</li>
    <li> It was very quickly shipped and is an awesome eyelash curler! Prob the best one ive had i love it a lot :)</li>
    <li> Arrived crushed...bad packaging.  I tried to bend it back in place but still won&#x27;t work.  I ended up throwing it away.</li>
    <li> This curler is not worth the (small) price. You can&#x27;t create enough pressure to curl the lashes for long. Get some other curler!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler has a great spring action which allows for easy &amp;#34;grip &amp; release&amp;#34; of your eyelash without sticking.</li>
    <li> Curler isn&#x27;t bad, is a little bit light, but doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good speed on the shipping from China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived however, I noticed a large blemish on the bottom of the pink handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost looks like a &amp;#34;oil/paint&amp;#34; smear across the bottom. i wonder if this product has been used before, or if it was mishandled during packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise perfect!</li>
    <li> It is way to small for one finger even. The pieces started to fall off the first time I used it. I recommend buying something thicker then this noodle tool that never works.</li>
    <li> good deal. works for my wife. no complaints.</li>
    <li> i needed a new eyelash curler so i saw this one, the reviews on it were pretty good, so i thought well why not? it came on a decent time, i opened it to find that it didn&#x27;t come with the little white rubber part that&#x27;s probably like the most important part unless you want your eyelashes to come off and your eyeballs to bleed.. VERY disappointed so i just threw it away, and when i clamped it together it had an awful noise..no just no...just take my warning..</li>
    <li> its cheap so i guess its ok&lt;br /&gt;i like the color&lt;br /&gt;but it pinches your skin on the edges&lt;br /&gt;i wouldnt buy again</li>
    <li> I just got it a few hours ago.  It looks slightly different from the picture.  It has a light pink sponge thing around the part where your eyelashes go.  That&#x27;s it lol, it&#x27;s not a complaint, just trying to help out.  Mine came in perfect condition, nice, shinny, and pretty.  It curls my lashes pretty darn good, I used it , then put on a thin coat of my &amp;#34;Maybelline New York The Colossal Volum&#x27; Express Washable Mascara&amp;#34; then boom, they just look completely fake, its amazing. Kutos!</li>
    <li> I bought this almost a year ago &amp; I still only use this one! I will be purchasing a new one soon , I have yet to find one that compares to this one . Inexpensive &amp; works great!</li>
    <li> I was afraid it would be cheaply made when I saw the price but decided to order any way. It is great I just it everyday. Its an all around great product.</li>
    <li> It was great it works perfectly better than my other ones but it starts to mess up a week after I got it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues that any of the other reviews have mentioned. It wasn&#x27;t bent when I got it and seems to be just fine. The only issue is that I can&#x27;t get the corners of my eyes with this no matter how hard I try, but maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
    <li> Poor built quality. Super cheap product. It was very awkward to use. One of the worst beauty products I purchased.</li>
    <li> DOES THE JOB. SIMPLE AND EASY AND GOOD PRICE :)</li>
    <li> i really like this product. Though it comes in the mail really slow. It isnt really a must have item</li>
    <li> its a low quality product. ive used and seen better, but for the price that it is, its okay. i like the pink color of it though :)</li>
    <li> This does the job for me and doesn&#x27;t pinch like some eyelash curlers tend to do. Good product for the money.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about buying this because I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work on not. It actually works alright for the money I spent. The bottom curler is a bit uneven because of the pull of the spring, but evens out when you actually use it. I&#x27;ve found that if I angle the finger hook (don&#x27;t know what else to call it) I can curl the outer lashes more. This gives a doe-eyed look. The bottom rubber sponge is getting a bit worn out after about a month, but curls normally. I would recommend it to anyone who will occasionally curl. However, if you&#x27;re looking for something to use every day, buy one of the Japonesque curlers. This one easily pinches if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often. It works well so far. It&#x27;s worth it, I mean, it&#x27;s only 2 dollars!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not the best. Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
    <li> I received this and was very disappointed by how it looked. As I tried it just simply felt like it was going to break. I am very disappointed with the quality. Not worth even this little amount of money.</li>
    <li> ok my daughter uses it. lightweight. she told her friends about it. good price. she uses it all the time</li>
    <li> The soft white part didn&#x27;t stay in AT ALL. These are terrible. I bought new ones from Walgreens a week later because I couldn&#x27;t handle it anymore. If you buy these be prepared to use your own glue to keep the white part in.</li>
    <li> Works very well for me and I have pretty short, thin eyelashes.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s not really much to say either than it sucks...it&#x27;s really cheap (figures) and it gets stuck when I move it...&lt;br /&gt;I guess it works in the curling department but I have to keep squeezing it until I feel satisfied that it&#x27;s done lol</li>
    <li> I was in desperate need for an eyelash curler so I bought the cheapest one I could find until I found a better one. As the price would suggest, this is a very cheap quality eyelash curler. The bottom rubber lining always sticks to the top, the curler sometimes catches my eyelid (I don&#x27;t know if this is a problem with my eye shape or if it&#x27;s a problem with the curler) and it&#x27;s very underwhelming overall. But, it&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price, and lasted me 6 whole months with no issues. Now I&#x27;m going to invest in a better one ahah.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so nice and works very well!! It had a bit of chip in the paint when I got it, but works great anyway</li>
    <li> To be honest it&#x27;s really cute and it actually works! Lol my eyelashes are curly now :D lol but yea it&#x27;s really easy to break so if you are looking for a PERFECT item... Don&#x27;t buy this one then.</li>
    <li> The clip needs to be wider. Because on other ones ive used i could actually flip outthe sides of my lashes to make them look as full as fake ones but this one isnt long enough. However i still do flip them out. All you have to do is turn it backwards (normal: the curv follows the curve of your eye. Backwards: the curve faces outward) you can use one of the far sideedges to curl the outside of your lashes with no umps. Also if you curl them n more than one place it looks great. Like curl right at the base of your lashes then again at the tips it looks phenominal. I use the stilleto and million lashes ( the gold tube one with J.Lo) and it works wonders. Just remember to put the one that makes it look like you have alot of lashes on first. And another tip is to put mascara only on the bottom side of the lasahes because sometimes when you putit on thetop it gets stuck. Good luck with this ladies</li>
    <li> I received my very first eyelash curler and the price was awesome but when it arrived it was shipped in an envelope only, I dont know why the don&#x27;t wrap it in bubble wrap or add some sot of protection but it was bent upon deliver. I was able to bend it back without breaking &amp; I have used it once and seems to work fine.</li>
    <li> it was smaller than i expected but it was cool!</li>
    <li> This lash curler is just as good as my old one I had for years that I paid 12 dollars for. Very happy with the quality and the pink rubber grip is a plus.</li>
    <li> I found it hard to use at first because I have small eyes and it was more curved that I would have liked, but after only a few tries I learned how to use it with my eye type.  Shipping was accurate and the product holds up nicely, It seems very reliable!</li>
    <li> I received this in a small envelope and a little bubble wrap, and I got a total bargain! Great product, works really really well. I love this!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice piece to have in a collection but i don&#x27;t find that it does much for me.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is surprisingly pretty good quality and works effectively. It is a little cumbersome to use , as you have to be very specific and not random with your positioning  when using it on your lashes....but all in all I&#x27;m not mad that I bought it.</li>
    <li> It was difficult to get all of my lashes into the curlers. They gave my lashes an uneven look. I have large round eyes and these were made for someone with an almond shape of eyes. I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a brand that suits me better</li>
    <li> great price it was delivered in like 3 days</li>
    <li> Awesome curlers! They are spring loaded--better than the traditional ones. Work great and would buy again. Actually got two  pair up front.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler works well. The pink is a fun color. Does not pinch or pull like some will. Nice little product.</li>
    <li> Best lash curler I have ever purchased. Bought two pairs. My daughter adores hers as well. Great buy. Don&#x27;t pass this one up.</li>
    <li> I got a few of these and all of them are crooked, cant be fixed, and just wont work. Bad purchase no matter how cheap they are.</li>
    <li> I have very long lashes and this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I keep it as a back up only.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to open the envelope when I got it, kinda disappointed when I check my order it doesn&#x27;t have an extra white rubber and its a &#x27;lil bit deformed.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a pretty strong spring in the curler that I&#x27;m still getting used to. It&#x27;s also not curved quite enough for my eye shape.</li>
