      <li>I am and was amazed at how effective it is.  </li>
      <li>This product is a must have for good strong healthy dreads!</li>
      <li>In a word &amp;#34;excellent,&amp;#34; the very best I&#x27;ve used so far without a doubt.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
      <li>I purchased this product and been using it for a week or better</li>
      <li>I love the nag champa, and had lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; when I used the patchouli.</li>
      <li>Thank you DollyLocks for creating a fantastic unmatchable product!</li>
      <li>I love the smell as well.</li>
      <li>It has such a mild, beautiful scent!</li>
      <li>and it has such a beautiful aroma.</li>
      <li>my hair is the consistency of a fine cotton</li>
      <li>wow, this one smells sooooooo good.</li>
      <li>The smell is amazing and the shipping was super fast!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s great for beginners to help keep all those loose hairs under control and help keep it conditioned as well!</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about this.</li>
      <li>but when you spray it in your hair it mellows out a lot to something more subtle, it is nice and refreshing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and company!!!</li>
      <li>It arrived super fast, within 2-3 days of ordering.</li>
      <li>Great smell, long lasting... does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>
      <li>The shipping was super fast and I will likely try more of the products.</li>
      <li>just like if you picked up a box of nag champa and gave it a whiff, literally, exactly like that.</li>
      <li>There was even candy shipped with it, Thanks! &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>Absolutely adore this product!</li>
      <li>this stuff really tames frizzy hair.</li>
      <li>This item shipped so fast.</li>
      <li>After about a week it lightened up a bit and several sprays is totally doable without being super strong.</li>
      <li>In their defense I have read reviews on other nag champa oils and sprays and many have people commenting on the hint of baby powder smell they receive from those products.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to tighten their dreads.</li>
      <li>and i see where the old loc&#x27;s are much more bonded and the news aren&#x27;t as loose.</li>
      <li>The smell was so overwhelming i rolled a window down in my car.</li>
      <li>Made with all natural ingredients and its VEGAN with no animal testing!</li>
      <li>When I first received it i sprayed two to three sprays and went into public.</li>
      <li>My dreads are only 3 months old and this stuff has helped them mature so much!</li>
      <li>The bottle is also a very descent size, way bigger than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>After only one month of use: My locs have undergone a much faster tighter maturing process than before I bought</li>
      <li>Makes your dreads just right soft and tight.</li>
      <li>I ordered this Sunday night and received it Wednesday 3.00 sharp, very fast hipping.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about this. I love the smell as well. This is my second bottle of Nag Champa and I&#x27;ve had one patchouli. I love the nag champa, and had lots of compliments on my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; when I used the patchouli. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Absolutely adore this product! Smells amazing and truly tightens up locks, no gimmick. Made with all natural ingredients and its VEGAN with no animal testing! It arrived super fast, within 2-3 days of ordering. All in all if there were 10 stars, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars. I&#x27;m ordering my second one now actually! Thank you DollyLocks for creating a fantastic unmatchable product!</li>
    <li> Good product like you come to expect from Dollylocks. When I first received it i sprayed two to three sprays and went into public. The smell was so overwhelming i rolled a window down in my car. I also heard people commenting as I passed them. ( not necessarily in a good way) After about a week it lightened up a bit and several sprays is totally doable without being super strong. I am not sure why this would be. That being said this smells good. But I have noticed that sometimes it kind of has a baby powder scent. Others have asked if I was wearing baby powder on occasion. Not that this is a bad smell but not what I am going for. In their defense I have read reviews on other nag champa oils and sprays and many have people commenting on the hint of baby powder smell they receive from those products. I have never noticed that smell with incense though.</li>
    <li> Great smell, long lasting... does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to!</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this product!!! I think it&#x27;s great for beginners to help keep all those loose hairs under control and help keep it conditioned as well! The smell is amazing and the shipping was super fast!</li>
    <li> Product smells amazing, and does as described. Very satisfied with results.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve got dreads this stuff works wonders!</li>
    <li> If you are thinking about getting it, DO IT! My dreads are only 3 months old and this stuff has helped them mature so much! Not to mention you smell amazing!&lt;br /&gt;From one friend to another, I&#x27;d recommend this 1000x</li>
    <li> It does smell awesome. My locs are tighter. The shipping was super fast and I will likely try more of the products. I gave it 4 stars because it is a little pricey and I got a little flacking, not much but a little. Otherwise great product.</li>
    <li> hey there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;listen, i have had dreds for over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;they have been all lengths.&lt;br /&gt;however my hair is the consistency of a fine cotton ball.&lt;br /&gt;it never fully loc&#x27;d.&lt;br /&gt;i have been using this and i see where the old loc&#x27;s are much more bonded and the news aren&#x27;t as loose.</li>
    <li> Yum yum smells so good. Makes your dreads just right soft and tight.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product because of the smell! Since I have been using it my boyfriend tells me I smell like a hippy store! Best compliment ever :)</li>
    <li> After only one month of use: My locs have undergone a much faster tighter maturing process than before I bought Dollylocks Tightening Spray!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m never going back Dollylocks is my Brand from now on!</li>
    <li> I love it, it smells really good. People always complement me on how good my hair smells</li>
    <li> Smells absolutely amazing.</li>
    <li> so, i have reviewed this product in vanilla that it was a good product but smelled a bit off like baby vomit or something. holy wow, this one smells sooooooo good. just like if you picked up a box of nag champa and gave it a whiff, literally, exactly like that. this stuff really tames frizzy hair. i love it! i have made several different diy dread sprays but none of the results came close to this product. now that i have found the fragrance for me i will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product! It has such a mild, beautiful scent! I get compliments whenever I use it! Fast shipping and awesome customer service! I highly recommend this product and company!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Sunday night and received it Wednesday 3.00 sharp, very fast hipping. It sort of smells like laundry detergent in the bottle but when you spray it in your hair it mellows out a lot to something more subtle, it is nice and refreshing. The bottle is also a very descent size, way bigger than I thought it would be. I would recommend this to anyone. There was even candy shipped with it, Thanks! &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This product is a must have for good strong healthy dreads!</li>
    <li> absolutely love the stuff! it works just like it says it does and it has such a beautiful aroma. would buy again and again and again. Next time I&#x27;d like to try the patchouli fields. would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> In a word &amp;#34;excellent,&amp;#34; the very best I&#x27;ve used so far without a doubt.  I am and was amazed at how effective it is.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to tighten their dreads.</li>
    <li> Great product smells good and makes the locks tighter. Will buy again when this one runs out!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and been using it for a week or better and my locs well I see no difference..&lt;br /&gt;But the nag smell great!</li>
    <li> This item shipped so fast. It came before the date it said it would. Smells just like nag champa. Very pleased.</li>
