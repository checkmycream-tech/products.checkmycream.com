      <li>This soap bar is massive, and smells great.</li>
      <li>Only soap I use, great gift</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell.</li>
      <li>This smells great and after using it, you can still smell it a bit off dry skin.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love this soap, I really did, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
      <li>What else do you want in a big bar of soap that lasts a good while?</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a big bar and lasts fairly well.  </li>
      <li>They are mildly scented.</li>
      <li>I bought the Blue Navy one because initially it smelled the best.</li>
      <li>The price is high but the bar lasts longer than most.  </li>
      <li>Go ahead and try it out, I&#x27;m gonna look for another brand after I finish this bar of soap, which is pretty f*****g huge.</li>
      <li>Also, some of the proceeds go to a good military cause.</li>
      <li>Love the size and it last a good long time, no weenie soap slivers in a week.</li>
      <li>The bar is massive,  I&#x27;m a healthy sized guy and this is a handful.</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s big, smells good, and also doubles as a solid shampoo.</li>
      <li>real large size bar a bit cumbersome when new</li>
      <li>That said, there are oats mixed in to the soap which makes it quite easy to grip, and they donate of portion of the profits to the troops which is an added plus.</li>
      <li>Large bar of soap and gets the job done.  </li>
      <li>The bars are huge and last forever!</li>
      <li>I really like these Duke Cannon soaps.</li>
      <li>And yes, it really does smell like Naval Supremacy.  </li>
      <li>Cleans you very well.</li>
      <li>if you feel the same I think you will enjoy this if you don&#x27;t expect anything unreasonable from a bar of soap.</li>
      <li>When you first begin using a new bar</li>
      <li>Love the smell, but the oat particles scratched more than I would like and the soap didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for different forms of marketing lol.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell, but for the price I expected it to have a long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is subtle, yet masculine, and it will last you many, many showers.</li>
      <li>They clean well and leave skin dry, non-greasy.</li>
      <li>Its simple utility makes it pretty manly indeed.</li>
      <li>When it first makes suds the soap smells very different</li>
      <li>Good job Duke Cannon even if you are a little mean boss ;-)</li>
      <li>I went back to the store and purchased two other bars and the shaving cream but the bar I&#x27;m using is still going strong.</li>
      <li>I would stay clear of this.</li>
      <li>It is a bit drying on sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>However I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price when you can get a three pack of Dove for Men for half what this costs.</li>
      <li>The particles are large and rough.  </li>
      <li>The dead skin and dirt come right off.</li>
      <li>This is my second bar of Duke Cannon soap so naturally I picked a different scent.</li>
      <li>but after you dry yourself off the scent goes back to normal.</li>
      <li>I ,sadly to say need more natural  ingredient soaps for I tend to get rashes and break out from commercial  ones .</li>
      <li>Decent soap, just not worth the price.</li>
      <li>I gave this stuff a shot because I&#x27;m a sucker for military stuff, and it worked fine.</li>

<li> Firstly I find it a little silly/stupid to say that by using a soap that isn&#x27;t natural or smells &amp;#34; feminine&amp;#34; (whatever that&#x27;s supposed to mean) is supposed to make you less of a man.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love the soap. I hate the oatmeal chunks in it. They stick out and jab you. Some say it helps you grab the soap. I say it doesn&#x27;t and it&#x27;s just irritating. If I want to exfoliate I&#x27;ll use my wife&#x27;s dainty scrubby thing to feel pretty. But I don&#x27;t want to exfoliate and I don&#x27;t want freaking oatmeal in my soap. If you have to have something in there then use wood chips or recycled bituminous or something that isn&#x27;t a breakfast cereal.</li>
    <li> Huge bar, smells awesome.  I will buy this and/or other Duke Cannon soaps in the future.  The only problem is it might take two hands to use but that&#x27;s a good problem to have.</li>
    <li> Instant hit at the fish camp.</li>
    <li> I really like these Duke Cannon soaps. They are mildly scented. They clean well and leave skin dry, non-greasy. I have dry skin and it hasn&#x27;t made it too dry. Used on the face, it seems to reduce wrinkles. They are big bars, so I cut them in half to last longer. The oat flakes in the bar seem to be more for grip than exfoliate.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed, didn&#x27;t last too long, didn&#x27;t really enjoy the smell. I would stay clear of this.</li>
    <li> Smells manly as hell. Everyone should use this.</li>
    <li> This soap bar is massive, and smells great. I like the exfoliating bits inside the soap as well. I like this scent better than the &amp;#34;army&amp;#34; scent, but the army one is still good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to trying all of the other scents!</li>
    <li> Best soap ever. Love the size and it last a good long time, no weenie soap slivers in a week.</li>
    <li> Smells great!  So glad my husband likes it!</li>
    <li> I have used two or three of these bars and reserved judgment until I tried it a couple times.  The up side is the naval supremacy smells awesome,  reminds me of a soap or aftershave my grandfather used. He served in the Navy during WWII in the Pacific, the generation when men were still men so the smell isn&#x27;t the least bit girly. The bar is massive,  I&#x27;m a healthy sized guy and this is a handful. The oats in the soap give a good scratching feeling on the skin. I also like that a donation is made to veteran causes from the sale.  The bad is that the bar goes about as fast as any other soap.  If your average dial bar was the same size it would last just as long, so it isn&#x27;t the never ending gobstopper of the soap world. Don&#x27;t be mistaken, this is a luxury item.  But I work hard for what I have so I feel I&#x27;m entitled to spend a couple extra bucks on a luxury soap a few times a year,  if you feel the same I think you will enjoy this if you don&#x27;t expect anything unreasonable from a bar of soap.</li>
    <li> showed up when promised.  I love this soap. I am going to be trying the other Duke Canon soaps</li>
    <li> smelled better than all the rest</li>
    <li> Works as described. Shipment went as planned</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this soap, I really did, but it just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Love the smell, but the oat particles scratched more than I would like and the soap didn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected. Decent soap, just not worth the price. Makes a good gift based on &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; factor but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I started using Duke Cannon through a Groupon I think about 18 months ago or so.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hooked. I like the size (I hate having a bar of soap disappear after a week. It makes me think I&#x27;m essentially paying for a lot of air.)&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell. (I like the Black version, but prefer this smell.)&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s good stuff. Just a precaution, it&#x27;s a BIG bar of soap. It may be difficult for petite hands to grab.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought most all of the offerings from this company and have been well pleased.  It&#x27;s a big bar and lasts fairly well.  Nice mild aroma.  When you first begin using a new bar the edges are a little sharp.  There is also a pumice in the soap that takes some getting used to.  The particles are large and rough.  The price is high but the bar lasts longer than most.  Also, some of the proceeds go to a good military cause.</li>
    <li> Truly huge soap.  And yes, it really does smell like Naval Supremacy.  No kidding, it&#x27;s a big ass bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Very nice easy to hold bar of soap</li>
    <li> Great soap! It&#x27;s big, smells good, and also doubles as a solid shampoo. Its simple utility makes it pretty manly indeed.</li>
    <li> It has a great smell, but for the price I expected it to have a long lasting scent. After coming out of the shower, it&#x27;s not as strong. I could compare the scent to Zest. Go ahead and try it out, I&#x27;m gonna look for another brand after I finish this bar of soap, which is pretty f*****g huge. I would only buy this soap again just because a portion of the sale goes to US Veterans.</li>
    <li> Your want soap this is the soap to get best soap I ever used in my life</li>
    <li> I love this soap.  It lathers well and smells great.  What else do you want in a big bar of soap that lasts a good while?</li>
    <li> This smells great and after using it, you can still smell it a bit off dry skin. It is a bit drying on sensitive skin. Its size will help it last a long time.</li>
    <li> Smells Great.  Big bar.</li>
    <li> As it says on the box, it is a big a** brick of soap. The scent is subtle, yet masculine, and it will last you many, many showers. That said, there are oats mixed in to the soap which makes it quite easy to grip, and they donate of portion of the profits to the troops which is an added plus. Only complaint is that it can get a little slippery when you rinse it off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for different forms of marketing lol. Firstly I find it a little silly/stupid to say that by using a soap that isn&#x27;t natural or smells &amp;#34; feminine&amp;#34; (whatever that&#x27;s supposed to mean) is supposed to make you less of a man. Whatever Monseigneur Duke ... Yet this company&#x27;s blatant use of toughness still reeled me in. I couldn&#x27;t wait to get a bar so I can be a man&#x27;s man lol. I traveled through the US and found a store that carried them. I bought the Blue Navy one because initially it smelled the best. I used it during my entire  vacation. I ,sadly to say need more natural  ingredient soaps for I tend to get rashes and break out from commercial  ones . Is that a knock on my masculinity Duke ? So bottom line. I love this soap, I didn&#x27;t break out and I WANT YOU TO HIRE ME ! Great smell, feel clean and I&#x27;m sold and willing to sell. I went back to the store and purchased two other bars and the shaving cream but the bar I&#x27;m using is still going strong. It will probably last me 2-3 months. Good job Duke Cannon even if you are a little mean boss ;-)</li>
    <li> This is my second bar of Duke Cannon soap so naturally I picked a different scent. The scent is complex and hard to describe but I will attempt... ocean, welded steel, worn leather, and honey badger. When it first makes suds the soap smells very different but after you dry yourself off the scent goes back to normal. The bars are huge and last forever!</li>
    <li> Large bar of soap and gets the job done.  You do not need to worry about losing the puppy in the shower or bath.</li>
    <li> nothing great to write about.  ok scent not too strong and not too appealing.  ok clean feeling after use.  real large size bar a bit cumbersome when new</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
    <li> Cleans you very well. The dead skin and dirt come right off. I will only use this soap now. Smell like a champ too.</li>
    <li> Only soap I use, great gift</li>
    <li> I gave this stuff a shot because I&#x27;m a sucker for military stuff, and it worked fine. However I don&#x27;t think it was worth the price when you can get a three pack of Dove for Men for half what this costs. I did not like the blue residue that the soap left behind in the shower or the little pieces of oats that are randomly in the bar.</li>
