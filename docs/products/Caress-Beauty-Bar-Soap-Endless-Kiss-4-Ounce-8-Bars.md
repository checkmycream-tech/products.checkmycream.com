### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I bought these soaps to use as part of a gift I was compiling for my volunteers and they are the best smelling soaps.  </li>

      <li>Very pleasant.</li>
      <li>This soap is wonderful, smells so good!  </li>
      <li>This does not smell good at all!</li>
      <li>Arrived timely and in great condition.</li>
      <li>Caress has been a welcome staple in my house for eons.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasant, mild-scented, moisturizing bar soap.  </li>
      <li>This soap does a good job of cleaning without over drying my skin.</li>
      <li>Now I&#x27;m just trying to find a handmade, denser bar of soap that smells as good as this...</li>
      <li>The nice fragrance kind of envelopes in the bath, but once out of the bath doesn&#x27;t stand out like a sore thumb!</li>
      <li>For those that enjoyed the excellence and superior fragrance of \\&quot;Evenly</li>
      <li>as i primarliy use this at work and who doesnt like to smell nice after work.</li>
      <li>Lathers well and is kind to my skin.  </li>
      <li>This bar soap is smooth on the skin just like dove,smells good, my family likes them and will recommend it.</li>
      <li>The scent is a nice Vanilla Sandlewood that&#x27;s been my favorite in all forms for a while.</li>
      <li>I will buy more of this</li>
      <li>My boyfriend prefers this soap over some of the manlier scents I&#x27;ve purchased for him. :)</li>
      <li>I received my order in a timely manner, and I am extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can still find this scent here.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a year or more now and have it on Subscribe and Save.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than Dove and smells better.</li>
      <li>Sure, I use lovely scented washes, but I still find myself reaching for Caress.</li>
      <li>The sensation in the bath is remarkably like the feeling you had that first kiss with someone special!</li>
      <li>This particular variety is quite nice!</li>
      <li>My sweet man is a longtime caress soap fan!</li>
      <li>that very quickly convenient service that has arrived today.</li>
      <li>(Probably it was more of a marketing piece than a true review.)  </li>
      <li>I feel so smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>Gorgeous\\&quot; was to those of us that want a nice intimate easy going fragrance to make us feel special about ourselves.</li>
      <li>The fragrance does not linger on the skin after showering the way the original scent does, but I&#x27;m fine with that</li>
      <li>The scent is pleasant and mild with the vanilla most obvious.  </li>
      <li>Leaves the nice easy going fragrance of Vanilla on your skin while still leaving your skin feel soft.</li>
      <li>I thought I was getting the original scent but NOO.</li>
      <li>The bars seem to last awhile for me, and the smell is very nice and mild.</li>
      <li>This product is the most amazing to use based on daily bathing.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t think of anything that makes this wash stand out as something particularly unique or special.  </li>
      <li>It lathers up nicely, has a nice pleasant smell and the bar seems to last maybe a little longer than the original</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had several comments on how everyone loved the scent.  </li>
      <li>A nice soft fragrance of Vanilla while bathing almost smells like Vanilla ice cream but is a little more dreamy and exotic!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty soft and nice for anyone.</li>
      <li>I have used Caress soap for many years and this is the nicest one so far,</li>
      <li>The price was right for these, as well.</li>
      <li>The first time I bought this, I had it sitting out, still in the box in the bathroom, and every time I walked into the bathroom, I was pleasantly surprised by the smell that had filled the room.</li>
      <li>I love the feminine woody smell and it really is a creamy lather and have bought it multiple times.</li>
      <li>When you first open it, you might think the smell is too strong, but that wears off a bit as you use the soap.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t ultra-sweet, but the vanilla and sandalwood give it a deep, rich aroma that reminds me of With Love by Hillary Duff and Japanese Cherry Blossom from BBW.</li>
      <li>I normally buy just the regular Caress and this seems to be a litle better.</li>
      <li>Absolutely smells</li>
      <li>shipped out fast, and the soap is more gentle on the skin then a lot of other soaps I have ever used</li>
      <li>For years I&#x27;ve used the original scent in the pale-peach box, which has a very traditional, flowery \\&quot;soap\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>I like that scent, but Endless Kiss is very different and a nice change of pace.</li>
      <li>I can only use caress soap other soaps cause irritation I love the smell of this soap and the softness on my skin</li>
      <li>i have sensitive skin and caress soap is the only soap i use....</li>
      <li>Soap didn&#x27;t contain the same strength of fragrance as that sold in stores which leads me to believe that maybe it was old.</li>
      <li>I like Caress In general, as I find regular soap too drying.</li>
      <li>My husband seems to enjoy it as well, and hasn&#x27;t complained of dry skin in the winter like before.&lt;br</li>

    <li> I like Caress In general, as I find regular soap too drying. For years I&#x27;ve used the original scent in the pale-peach box, which has a very traditional, flowery \\&quot;soap\\&quot; scent. I like that scent, but Endless Kiss is very different and a nice change of pace. It isn&#x27;t ultra-sweet, but the vanilla and sandalwood give it a deep, rich aroma that reminds me of With Love by Hillary Duff and Japanese Cherry Blossom from BBW. Very pleasant. The fragrance does not linger on the skin after showering the way the original scent does, but I&#x27;m fine with that because I don&#x27;t like my soap to clash with my perfume.</li>
    <li> I received my order in a timely manner, and I am extremely satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> This is what Caress is about! A nice soft fragrance of Vanilla while bathing almost smells like Vanilla ice cream but is a little more dreamy and exotic! The nice fragrance kind of envelopes in the bath, but once out of the bath doesn&#x27;t stand out like a sore thumb! Leaves the nice easy going fragrance of Vanilla on your skin while still leaving your skin feel soft. The sensation in the bath is remarkably like the feeling you had that first kiss with someone special! For those that enjoyed the excellence and superior fragrance of \\&quot;Evenly Gorgeous\\&quot; but wished there were none of those exfoliating beads, Endless Kiss is truly the answer! Finally an answer as \\&quot;Evenly Gorgeous\\&quot; was to those of us that want a nice intimate easy going fragrance to make us feel special about ourselves.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this from Amazon the last few months, I used to buy them in stores however they&#x27;ve become hard to find recently. I&#x27;m glad I can still find this scent here. The scent is a nice Vanilla Sandlewood that&#x27;s been my favorite in all forms for a while. It&#x27;s pretty soft and nice for anyone. My boyfriend prefers this soap over some of the manlier scents I&#x27;ve purchased for him. :)</li>
    <li> My sweet man is a longtime caress soap fan! This particular variety is quite nice! Absolutely smells divine!&lt;br /&gt;~~Mrs. PK</li>
    <li> I bought this type of Caress to try something a little different. I normally buy just the regular Caress and this seems to be a litle better. It lathers up nicely, has a nice pleasant smell and the bar seems to last maybe a little longer than the original but that is opinion. I will buy more of this as i primarliy use this at work and who doesnt like to smell nice after work.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than Dove and smells better. Less than a dollar/count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does melt soon like any moisturized soap like Dove or Olay would.</li>
    <li> I bought these soaps to use as part of a gift I was compiling for my volunteers and they are the best smelling soaps.  When you first open it, you might think the smell is too strong, but that wears off a bit as you use the soap.  I&#x27;ve had several comments on how everyone loved the scent.  Definitely recommend and at the time I bought them, they were cheaper than the grocery store.  Arrived timely and in great condition.</li>
    <li> Soap didn&#x27;t contain the same strength of fragrance as that sold in stores which leads me to believe that maybe it was old.</li>
    <li> This smells horrible. I thought I was getting the original scent but NOO. This does not smell good at all!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a year or more now and have it on Subscribe and Save. The scent is pleasant and mild with the vanilla most obvious.  It is a firmer bar compared to the Olay soap bars I also use and lasts longer.  That said, I do not feel that it&#x27;s quite as moisturizing either, though it&#x27;s certainly less drying than a deodorant bar. I alternate between this and various Olay bars and like it a lot. My husband seems to enjoy it as well, and hasn&#x27;t complained of dry skin in the winter like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a pleasant, mild-scented, moisturizing bar soap.  It&#x27;s worth a try, at least, to judge for yourself.</li>
    <li> This soap is wonderful, smells so good!  Lathers well and is kind to my skin.  I have used Caress soap for many years and this is the nicest one so far,</li>
    <li> shipped out fast, and the soap is more gentle on the skin then a lot of other soaps I have ever used</li>
    <li> This bar soap is smooth on the skin just like dove,smells good, my family likes them and will recommend it.</li>

I love the feminine woody smell and it really is a creamy lather and have bought it multiple times. Now I&#x27;m just trying to find a handmade, denser bar of soap that smells as good as this...</li>
    <li> Caress has been a welcome staple in my house for eons. Sure, I use lovely scented washes, but I still find myself reaching for Caress. When my son isn&#x27;t looking, I&#x27;ll slip in one of these newer scented ones.&lt;br /&gt;The aroma of this one is divine!</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance from it. I feel so smooth and silky. Decent quality for a small price to pay.</li>
    <li> This product is the most amazing to use based on daily bathing. I truly appreciate. I also were very impressed that very quickly convenient service that has arrived today.</li>
    <li> I had read a review of this Caress Endless Kiss in a magazine or somewhere recently.  (Probably it was more of a marketing piece than a true review.)  Yes, Caress makes great product!  The scent of the vanilla isn&#x27;t anything that stays with you.  It&#x27;s \\&quot;nice\\&quot; but I can&#x27;t think of anything that makes this wash stand out as something particularly unique or special.  It&#x27;s just not a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; for me...</li>
    <li> i have sensitive skin and caress soap is the only soap i use....It doesn&#x27;t make my skin&lt;br /&gt;itch...I am using it on my granddaughters also, as the shapoo products i was using had an&lt;br /&gt;ingredient  in it that was not safe for children...</li>
    <li> I can only use caress soap other soaps cause irritation I love the smell of this soap and the softness on my skin</li>
