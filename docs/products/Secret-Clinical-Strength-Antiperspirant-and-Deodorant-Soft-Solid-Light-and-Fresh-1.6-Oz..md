      <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
      <li>For me, this deodorant works well, smells pleasant (or not at all, if I wish), and feels like a reasonable value.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this product works great.</li>
      <li>&quot; right on the label and to be honest, I didn&#x27;t look at the measurement when I was rushing through the store, I looked at the package.  </li>
      <li>While this didn&#x27;t end up working for me because of my sensitive skin issues, it was very effective as a deodorant and antiperspirant.  </li>
      <li>I like the smell it isn&#x27;t too sweet like normal women&#x27;s deodorants which I&#x27;m happy about I was looking</li>
      <li>are too strong.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good product and does what it says so long as you follow directions.</li>
      <li>and it still seems to work fine.</li>
      <li>Smells great and last all day..</li>
      <li>I didnt pay attention and thought it was a solid still works just as great.</li>
      <li>It has a light and almost unnoticeable smell</li>
      <li>Powder scent is light and does not fight with any perfume.  </li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure of the directions at first, of</li>
      <li>Have been purchasing for a long time, still happy with it.</li>
      <li>It lasts all day long and smells great.</li>
      <li>This was only a travel size which is fairly convenient.</li>
      <li>Keeps your pit smelling good and dry.</li>
      <li>but I really put it to the test and it won!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it to have one on hand when you need it.</li>
      <li>Just remember you have to start using well before the date of your event in order for it to be fully effective though I have used it on shorter notice occasionally</li>
      <li>As a woman that is frequently on the move during the day as well as a runner, I was hoping for more from this product.  </li>
      <li>and my husband says my pits smell like fresh melons</li>
      <li>and I was right.</li>
      <li>For the first couple of weeks, it was fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Been using exactly this brand, exactly this scent since it came out.</li>
      <li>I will say that there isn&#x27;t much in these &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34;, but I do think it is worth the expense.</li>
      <li>I have even in winter and hot summers.</li>
      <li>This really saved me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the only one that works all day.</li>
      <li>and it really works!</li>
      <li>This works pretty well.</li>
      <li>and I never use any other kind.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth my money tho :/</li>
      <li>Well look no more, this is the best stuff out there, you will not have to worry any longer, I love this stuff, although a little more than your average antiperspirant, but definitely worth the extra money.  </li>
      <li>It really was not usable.</li>
      <li>I just use it when I know I&#x27;m gonna sweat like working out or really humid days.  </li>
      <li>haha.</li>
      <li>and make its job very well..</li>
      <li>Great price on clinical strength Secret.</li>
      <li>Definitely my new go to!</li>
      <li>These deodorants always speak to the sweating, but not the odor which is my main concern.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Decent protection</li>
      <li>i&#x27;d highly recommend to try it</li>
      <li>Maybe I have high testosterone for a gal, maybe I&#x27;m just Aphrodite and my pheromones</li>
      <li>high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is THE ONLY one I can use with success.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a bit more expensive than other deodorants, but it does have a lot of good qualities.  </li>
      <li>The smell is great and it does a good job at keeping me dry, even through brutal Crossfit workouts.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s getting warmer where I live</li>
      <li>and I also live in Texas</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of messy in that it does get white streaks on clothing.</li>
      <li>This deodorant works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
      <li>Amazon occasionally has a coupon that can make this really cheap so clip it and just add one of these to your prime or free shipping order since it&#x27;s an add-on item and will only cost a few bucks.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the other scents this deodorant has, and have a special aversion to the &#x27;powder&#x27; scent (gag).</li>
      <li>All through junior high and high school I always wore a jacket over clothes, and didn&#x27;t like wearing anything but colors that could hide the sweat, which was there even in the middle of winter.</li>
      <li>Looked inside dispenser when the product on its little pedestal was finally pushed up to the top, and discovered ...</li>
      <li>Lesson learned on my behalf, but this packaging is clearly extraneous and misleading.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
      <li>&#x3D; how much product is actually in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure of the directions at first, of it was two clicks for each arm or one for each. The feeling of the deodorant is a little strange at first, but it does feel dry when it goes on, almost too dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reapplied about half a click to both arms in the morning because I didn&#x27;t trust it to last throughout the next day as well and I was right. I was sweating all day and smelled by the end of the day. Now this could be because I didn&#x27;t use it right, I&#x27;m not sure. These deodorants always speak to the sweating, but not the odor which is my main concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will increase two two clicks each arm day and night. This means I will be out of deodorant by next week probably with tiny amount that&#x27;s in there, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> This is the best clinical deodorant that I&#x27;ve found at a fairly reasonable price. There may be better ones out there but they tend to be cost prohibitive.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past. Only a small amount is needed. The scent is good.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I use that works!</li>
    <li> BEST DEODORANT EVER. I have tried soon many deodorants but it never worked cuz my sweat and stench would go through it making the mixed smells worse. I was a swimmer and athletic person so I sweat a lot... This really saved me!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product works great. Very subtle smell you won&#x27;t get tired of.</li>
    <li> Been using exactly this brand, exactly this scent since it came out. This deodorant, seriously changed my whole life. I have always been a sweaty armpit person (not a smelly sweaty, but constant sweat), and was SO insecure about it. All through junior high and high school I always wore a jacket over clothes, and didn&#x27;t like wearing anything but colors that could hide the sweat, which was there even in the middle of winter. I put this on after showering, and don&#x27;t have to reapply until my next shower, even if that is two days later. I thought maybe I grew out of the problem, but have tried over the years not using it, and a couple of times have forgotten it when I traveled, and I definitely still sweat like crazy. No other deodorant works even a little for me. This is THE ONLY one I can use with success. And it smells awesome! People sometimes ask me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing, and I tell them it&#x27;s my D.O., haha. I don&#x27;t like the other scents this deodorant has, and have a special aversion to the &#x27;powder&#x27; scent (gag).</li>
    <li> I sweat a lot during the summer. This works pretty well. Its not perfect but better than the others out there (non prescription)</li>
    <li> Great price on clinical strength Secret. I have an athlete daughter in the house and this stuff works wonders for her.</li>
    <li> great product and works better than cheaper brands. However, it&#x27;s expensive and the is quantity is low.</li>
    <li> easiest to apply - the hard solids don&#x27;t seem to want to come off the stick and stay on your skin.  Absolutely the best in stopping me from perspiring that I&#x27;ve ever found.  Powder scent is light and does not fight with any perfume.  My only anti-persperant.  Stock up!</li>
    <li> So I sweat alother and have tried dozens of deodorants , and none have helped. This product is amazing, it works. Not much more to say other than to say buy it and try it and you&#x27;ll see it&#x27;s the best</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It works amazingly! It smells good and I never use any other kind. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> No scent no stains on clothing.</li>
    <li> As a woman that is frequently on the move during the day as well as a runner, I was hoping for more from this product.  My biggest concern is that it does not provide protection for longer than 6 hours.</li>
    <li> Clinical strength has worked better for me than anything I&#x27;ve ever used and I have been around a long time.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is hands down the only thing that will work for me. Maybe I have high testosterone for a gal, maybe I&#x27;m just Aphrodite and my pheromones are too strong. Who knows? All I know is that this stuff is amazing and my husband says my pits smell like fresh melons so there you go :)</li>
    <li> Just used it tonight once I use it more I&#x27;ll comeback with a review I&#x27;m praying this will work because I sweat a lot .. I like the smell it isn&#x27;t too sweet like normal women&#x27;s deodorants which I&#x27;m happy about I was looking got something a bit stronger &amp; this is good !</li>
    <li> It works just as any other deodorant works. Honestly, I didn&#x27;t think it was worth my money tho :/</li>
    <li> The seller I used sent dried out deoderant. It really was not usable. I was just too busy to send it back, so beware. I purchased 2 sticks. One was completey dry and the crank was broken so it could not be used at all. The other slightly came out so I did try it and it seemed to work well. The scent was not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is awesome. I can skip a couple of days and it still works perfectly. It&#x27;s meant to be applied at night so it can absorb, and then you don&#x27;t get the white marks on your shirts.</li>
    <li> Keeps your pit smelling good and dry.</li>
    <li> This is excellent deodorant. It helps to prevent perspiration and is very effective. I have extremely sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I am currently taking several medications that increase sweating and I also live in Texas so finding a good anti-persperant has been a challenge. I will say that there isn&#x27;t much in these &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34;, but I do think it is worth the expense. It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming scent like some do. I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and it does a good job at keeping me dry, even through brutal Crossfit workouts.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Have you ever wanted an antiperspirant that you didn&#x27;t have to worry about protecting you all day and evening? Well look no more, this is the best stuff out there, you will not have to worry any longer, I love this stuff, although a little more than your average antiperspirant, but definitely worth the extra money.  You will love it too!</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. This was only a travel size which is fairly convenient.</li>
    <li> Smells great and last all day..</li>
    <li> I love  using  this  product  because  sweat  a  lot .  It  may  be  pricy  but  it  the only  deodorant  that  I  use.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. It lasts all day long and smells great. Definitely my new go to!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to this product.  Broke out in a very painful rash.</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that last all day and keep you smelling fresh. A bit on the expensive side for deodorant so I would suggest buying from a wholesale warehouse</li>
    <li> My job is quite stressful.  This deodorant works without fail.</li>
    <li> Since Secret has discontinued all deodorants I liked, I had to search for the one to replace them. Outlast turned out to be terrible, so I ordered Secret Clinical Strength. This product is pricey, but it does work well, and one tube lasts me several months. I don&#x27;t always follow the instructions about applying at night, but it still works well. Also, no need for 2-3 clicks. I find that one click works perfectly well, and saves you money too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product worth buying if you get a good deal like this 15$ for 3, otherwise not so sure.</li>
    <li> Only thing that works for me!</li>
    <li> I will say first off that the product that is in here - what little there is of it - does work well, and I&#x27;ve been putting it to the test through several weeks of intense July-August heat and high humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I cannot believe the extraneous packaging on this product.  I got a bundle of three at a warehouse club and they seemed to be of bigger size, as us warehouse club shoppers have come to expect.  This morning, while opening the second package, I decided to measure it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&gt; 5\\&quot; &#x3D; the height of the box it comes in.  Open the box and peer inside the folded over cardboard platform on top - see a little container way down inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&gt; 3.5\\&quot; &#x3D; the height of the actual container when removed from the box.  But wait - remove the one inch cap and then start turning, and turning, and turning the dial to get the product to start coming out of the dispenser.  Looked inside dispenser when the product on its little pedestal was finally pushed up to the top, and discovered ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&gt; 2\\&quot; &#x3D; how much product is actually in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand it says \\&quot;1.6 oz.\\&quot; right on the label and to be honest, I didn&#x27;t look at the measurement when I was rushing through the store, I looked at the package.  Lesson learned on my behalf, but this packaging is clearly extraneous and misleading.</li>
    <li> This is the best clinical deodorant out there. Stop reading this and buy it immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$2 coupon is just awesome!</li>
    <li> i like how it smells! and make its job very well..one of the best deodorants i&#x27;ve tried! i&#x27;d highly recommend to try it</li>
    <li> Been using this deodorant for years and its amazing. It has a light and almost unnoticeable smell and it really works! i used to have to change deodorants every few months because they would stop working or my body stopped reacting to them, but since I&#x27;ve been using this I probably haven&#x27;t changed the deodorant for at least 4 years.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is the best I have ever used. I didnt pay attention and thought it was a solid still works just as great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had allergic reactions to some Secret deodorants in the past (usually the clear gels), but this appeared to be a different formula so I decided to give it a try.  For the first couple of weeks, it was fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  However, as I got near the end of the deodorant stick, I noticed a rash and areas of dried out skin where I&#x27;d been using the deodorant.  I had to stop using it and throw it away.  Two days after stopping it and I&#x27;m still waiting for the rash to go away (it is improving, though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting warmer where I live and I run into a lot of situations during the day that cause me to sweat -- climbing the stairs (8 flights) at work, walking my dog at midday, and getting back in my car after it&#x27;s been in the sun (the AC is broken).  I&#x27;ve also been doing some pretty intense exercise lately.  And this has been working well for me as both an antiperspirant and a deodorant.  I&#x27;m very happy with the strength and effectiveness of this product -- and it lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a bit more expensive than other deodorants, but it does have a lot of good qualities.  While this didn&#x27;t end up working for me because of my sensitive skin issues, it was very effective as a deodorant and antiperspirant.  If you do not have sensitive skin, this would probably be a wonderful product for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I did before Secret Clinical Strength...but now I hate to be without it! For me, this deodorant works well, smells pleasant (or not at all, if I wish), and feels like a reasonable value. Have been purchasing for a long time, still happy with it.</li>
    <li> I like this stuff. It&#x27;s kind of messy in that it does get white streaks on clothing. But, I put it on at nightt so it&#x27;s not really an issue.</li>
    <li> This is not your ordinary deodorant. Its called clinical strength and it lives up to its name. It worked through my 1 hour daily work out session and while I was outdoor shopping in this Georgia humidity. I was skeptical at first but I really put it to the test and it won!!</li>
    <li> Decent protection but I personally feel all secret deodorants leave me with a funky smell at the end of the day.  I don&#x27;t regularly use deodorant because I don&#x27;t get B.O.  I just use it when I know I&#x27;m gonna sweat like working out or really humid days.  I will not purchase again.  I prefer degree deodorants.</li>
    <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve seen for my terrible perspiration problem I have even in winter and hot summers. I used it twice a day for only three days, then once a day and have not had a problem since. Saver on clothes; I was always ruining blouses because of sweat and worn material underarms; The best product I have used in years.</li>
    <li> excellent in every aspect</li>
    <li> If you have a hard time finding deodorant that works all day. This is the one. I&#x27;ve tried many and this is the only one that works all day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good product and does what it says so long as you follow directions. I used this in preparation for a summer wedding and I&#x27;m so glad I did. Just remember you have to start using well before the date of your event in order for it to be fully effective though I have used it on shorter notice occasionally and it still seems to work fine. Amazon occasionally has a coupon that can make this really cheap so clip it and just add one of these to your prime or free shipping order since it&#x27;s an add-on item and will only cost a few bucks. It&#x27;s worth it to have one on hand when you need it.</li>
