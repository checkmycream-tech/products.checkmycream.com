      <li>It cleans my hair without making it dry, and the fragrance is light and pleasant without being overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>The scent is pretty mild although nothing as I imagined after reading the front description.</li>
      <li>I have used a couple other popular organic shampoos and found, like another reviewer, that they don&#x27;t really clean well and can even leave a film-like texture to my hair.</li>

      <li>It worked really well for the first couple weeks, and then started making dandruff.</li>
      <li>Like the bottle says, you don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>I have very normal hair and this product did nothing at all for my hair.  </li>
      <li>MOP actually lathers up and my hair feels clean afterwards.</li>
      <li>Either way, it gently cleanses and leaves me hair soft</li>
      <li>I have another bottle on order right now , the last one lasted 6 months , keep in mind</li>
      <li>Complete lie.</li>
      <li>Gentle enough for every day use.</li>

<li> A little goes a long way</li>

<li> : originaly I thought it was a small bottle for the price , however a little dab goes a long way</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve read in beauty magazines to not wash hair everyday.</li>
<li> usually people who are not will fill out the review...</li>
<li> These bottles are expensive but they last me MONTHS</li>
<li> Usually a dose of head and shoulders does the trick.</li>
<li> My scalp tends to be pretty oily which I hate.</li>
<li> It made it very dull looking.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
<li> It is difficult to find, and I hope Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
<li> It makes me have dandruff :(</li>
<li> like there&#x27;s residue at the base of my strands even after a shower.</li>

    <li> My husband loves this shampoo.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate his scalp but it cleans effectively.  It also has a super fresh and natural scent.  Not loaded with perfume like so many shampoos.  His hair and scalp smell clean and natural.  We definitely recommend this shampoo.</li>
    <li> Gentle enough for every day use. Very nice mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and hair softness result but still having hair loss.  I would recommend it but may have to watch out for hair loss just as most of them would.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shampoo! I love that it is organic, lathers well, rinses easily and does not leave a strong perfumey scent on your hair. A little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This is the only organic shampoo product I have found that I actually like. MOP actually lathers up and my hair feels clean afterwards. Other products I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t lather and it feels like there&#x27;s still a film on my hair when I get out of the shower.</li>
    <li> I love MOP products. I&#x27;ve tried all of their shampoo variations and this one is my favorite. It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave a weird film on my hair.</li>
    <li> Very good product : originaly I thought it was a small bottle for the price , however a little dab goes a long way , the smell is pleasant , lathers well , over all I like it .. I have another bottle on order right now , the last one lasted 6 months , keep in mind however I have short hair .. I recommend it , its a good natural shampoo ..</li>
    <li> My hair looks shiny and feels great.  These bottles are expensive but they last me MONTHS: a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This shampoo works fine. I am glad I ordered it.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo I have found that doesn&#x27;t weigh down fine hair.  Try it--I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Feels great, Smells amazing and it&#x27;s Organic!</li>
    <li> And free shipping! How fabulous! I am in love with this shampoo and conditioner set too - talk about wonderful. I have been getting so many compliments because my hair looked noticeably softer with more volume.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is NOT even organic. Complete lie. Do not I repeat DO NOT buy this product. Research before buying!</li>
    <li> I have very normal hair and this product did nothing at all for my hair.  It made it very dull looking.  It felt like it was cleaning it good when I was using it, but then my hair looked bad after I dried it.</li>
    <li> Are they even making this any more?  Why do they always discontinue the good stuff?  It&#x27;s not like we weren&#x27;t buying it.</li>
    <li> My scalp tends to be pretty oily which I hate. I&#x27;ve read in beauty magazines to not wash hair everyday. I&#x27;m sorry, that doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using tons of different product in my hair, it starts to feel like there&#x27;s residue at the base of my strands even after a shower. Usually a dose of head and shoulders does the trick. Since that hasn&#x27;t been cutting it and Frederic Fekkai&#x27;s Apple cider cleansing shampoo wasn&#x27;t available, I decided to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: love it. The scent is pretty mild although nothing as I imagined after reading the front description. It&#x27;s kind of like hand soap? Either way, it gently cleanses and leaves me hair soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for years and my hair still shines. My hairdresser recently told me to keep using this shampoo telling me how healthy my hair is.</li>
    <li> I love this product just wish the bottle was bigger... However the rating I don&#x27;t like, you shouldn&#x27;t have a minimum word requirement...be thankful that people are even taking this survey... and why a headline or summary...this isn&#x27;t a dating website, either you like the product and are pleased with service or you are not...usually people who are not will fill out the review...just saying!</li>
