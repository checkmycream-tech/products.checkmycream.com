      <li>This product is great for acne and just a general product for normal skin too.</li>
      <li>I understand that my skin is probably drier than most normal people.</li>

      <li>immediately I couldnt stop touching my face :]and it dried up the acne</li>

      <li>Thank you very much.</li>

      <li>so I no longer have such issues, and my skin usually looks flawless.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a summertime moisturizer when your face is producing enough sebums.</li>
      <li>I could see results after the first wash.</li>
      <li>I thought it was pretty over priced at first</li>
      <li>So for about 3-4 years I was using the cheap over the counter cleanser (only $3-4 a pop!).</li>
      <li>however it wasn&#x27;t too much</li>
      <li>The bottle is made to where you can&#x27;t squirt too much out at once</li>
      <li>she really like it.</li>
      <li>have made the difference as much as this.</li>
      <li>With the gently cleansing and lightweight moisturizer, my acne began to heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t really afford this product anymore.</li>
      <li>thanks Mary kay...</li>
      <li>&quot; Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect - and inexpensive, too, especially since a little bit of each product goes a long way.</li>
      <li>I purchased this for my teenage kids battling acne and after trying many different products, the Velocity set really helps a lot.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for everyone.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a great skin care products for all skin types that I would recommend one of the best out there . Nonetheless very pleased</li>
    <li> I wear it and it really  has cleared up Most of my acne.  Would say tho you do have to wear it everyday  or else it won&#x27;t work as well.</li>
    <li> My face felt smoother and softer immediately I couldnt stop touching my face :]and it dried up the acne and my face looks and feels softer smoother and I like it very much I will not use anything on my face besides products from Mary Kay. It makes me feel better about myself and it makes me feel pretty. :]</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash and moisturizer to use. The bottle is made to where you can&#x27;t squirt too much out at once so you are getting just the right amount you need to use. This product is great for acne and just a general product for normal skin too. I am definitely a lifetime buyer of Mary Kay Velocity.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Velocity cleanser and moisturizer are a great combo for young skin. They keep my skin looking better than it ever has, much more radiant and blemish-free. I used to have problems with acne in my oily T-zone, but the Velocity cleanser and moisturizer balance my skin so I no longer have such issues, and my skin usually looks flawless. The only downside is the moisturizer takes some time to sink into the skin and for the face to feel \\&quot;dry.\\&quot; Otherwise, it&#x27;s perfect - and inexpensive, too, especially since a little bit of each product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> It seems alright for the price I paid. It&#x27;s descent and does not cause much trouble for my acne prone face. I really like the cleanser better than the moisturizer. The cleanser has tiny beads that are not coarse at all to make you feel like you&#x27;re scrubbing your face with sand like how you use apricot scrubs. Both of products are lightly scented. The moisturizer itself is too light to use during the winter season. It&#x27;s more of a summertime moisturizer when your face is producing enough sebums. I&#x27;m not so crazy about the moisturizer because it gives me peels which can actually be a good thing because it is a removal of dead skin cells yet it makes me look like I have patches when I wear a make-up.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Velocity Moisturizer is the only moisturizer I will put on my face! I&#x27;ve used it for years and I LOVE it. A little bit goes a long way, so the bottle lasts for a LONG time. It is the lightest moisturizer I have ever found. It feels like you didn&#x27;t put anything on your face, but it keeps you from drying out. I have half oily half dry skin, and this is perfect for it!</li>
    <li> I brought it for my granddaughter she really like it.</li>
    <li> I got this around two weeks ago and at first it made me break out horribly. I was about to throw it away but then realized I will give it one more week. It work amazingly!! I have tried Proactiv, Neutrogena, Dermalogica, and millions of others and none have made the difference as much as this. I have combination skin dry around the lips, oily on the nose, and normal everywhere else. It balances it out. I will recomend this to anyone and everyone. Just give it time</li>
    <li> I have type 2 acne.  I have spent well over $150+ on Murad, $100 on Proactive, and other $$$ OTC acne treatments.  What I love about MK Velocity is that it gently cleanses and exfoliates without harshness.  The moisturizer is light and your skin is breathable.  With the gently cleansing and lightweight moisturizer, my acne began to heal itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A trick I learned about acne is to use steam for 5-7 mins to open your pores, wash your face, lance acne pimples if necessary, pat dry with a soft papertowel and follow up with moisturizer.  It works everytime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less product is definately more!  All you&#x27;ll need for beautiful skin is these two items!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage kids battling acne and after trying many different products, the Velocity set really helps a lot.</li>
    <li> There was a hole in one of the bottles (the face wash) so half of it leaked out before I even got it. It was a sticky mess when I opened the package! What was left was at least good (I&#x27;ve read some other reviews where the product was spoiled or expired) so two stars.</li>
    <li> Mild moisturizer is light and clear.  The cleanser is nice with a light scrub folded into the cream.  Not bad at all.</li>
    <li> Great product; my face looks great</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I have used it for years. It sucks that Mary Kay discontinued it. What they replaced it with does not work nearly as good. It&#x27;s the only stuff that works for me. And it goes a LONG way. You only need a few drops to wash your whole face. The moisturizer not only moisturizes your face, it makes it feel smoother, and evens out your skin tone. Using both of these products together, I don&#x27;t even need any make up to feel or look great.  Mary Kay got a lot of complaints about the scent of this facial cleanser but honestly I like it and every one I&#x27;ve told to try it likes it too.</li>
    <li> Product was just as described.  Great service!</li>
    <li> This works great! It may be a bit spend but a little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve been using this stuff since I was 13 and am now 21 I have never had any problems with it. I have had oily skin and dry skin and it relieves both</li>
    <li> Bottom line: this is the only cleanser I will use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got into Mary Kay products because my sister in law was selling it. I thought it was pretty over priced at first but I purchased it anyways since I wanted my sister in law to make her commission. I used it the same night I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened the cleanser bottle I smelled a wonderful aroma. It&#x27;s hard for me to explain it. It was like a very light, sweet fragrance. I love the smell so much! As I was rubbing it on my face, all I could do was keep sniffing and sniffing. I know! I&#x27;m such a freak!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser felt awesome on my skin too. I could feel the little exfoliating beads however it wasn&#x27;t too much and it wasn&#x27;t too little. Mary Kay seemed to get it just right. A little bit of the product went a long way too. I only need about two or three small squirts of the bottle to cover my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with. I thought the smell was not as nice as the cleanser&#x27;s. But the moisturizer felt pretty good. It was very light. It felt like my skin could breathe. However, I felt like it wasn&#x27;t enough of a moisturizer, but then again, I have REALLY dry skin especially during the winter. So I used a small dab of my Elizabeth Arden cream in addition to this moisturizer, so problem fixed. An added bonus is that using the velocity moisturizer I only need a little bit of my Elizabeth Arden thereby extending the life of that expensive cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward a few years, when I was in college. I was a BROKE college student. I couldn&#x27;t really afford this product anymore. So for about 3-4 years I was using the cheap over the counter cleanser (only $3-4 a pop!). It worked. My skin stayed clear althoughout college but I found myself missing Mary Kay! My skin feel cleaner, more supple and softer while on Mary Kay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I am a graduate and am working, I am finally able to afford it. I purchased this almost immediately. From now on, I will not skimp out and will order this every time. Actually, now that I am as approaching my mid 20&#x27;s (eek!) I&#x27;ll give the Time Wise stuff a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this cleanser and moisturizer. The cleanser does its job and does it well. The smell of the cleanser is delicious; I cannot get enough of it. Even though I have to supplement the moisturizer, that&#x27;s alright. I understand that my skin is probably drier than most normal people. Although this product is a little pricey and not easily accessible, it is so worthit!ly, now that I am as approaching my mid 20&#x27;s (eek!) I&#x27;ll give the Time Wise stuff a go.

    <li> I have just started using it and I love it I could see results after the first wash. I highly recommend it for everyone. It works really well. Get it now, this is a great deal for the two cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I am disappointed they discontinued it and now have to pay over $50! But it&#x27;s kind of worth it. Love love love. Fast secure shipping too!</li>
    <li> I have used this product most of my adult life because other products sold in stores blow my face up immediately. Mary Kay replaced this product with Botanicals a few years ago but I have refused to change... as long as I can still find this product.. I will continue to purchase it... works extremely good for sensitive skin.  E. For viewing. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DX5854C/ref&#x3D;od_aui_detailpages00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m addicted! I recieved quickly and product was wrap in orginal seal (perfect).</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected. The package was perfect and it came in a timely manner  the goods were brand new just like they were supposed to be. I didnt have any problems.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> This is amazing products.  Every single night I wash my face with the cleanser and it has helped incredibly with my acne and dry skin.  In about one week I noticed a big difference in my skin appearance.  I love this.  Non greasy, washes off easily.  I use the moisturizer every morning under my makeup.  Love this.  Totally non greasy, soaks in and drys fast.  Love the feeling on my face.  Feels nice under makeup.  Would totally recommend this products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the way it smells but it really makes your skin smooth and cleans it well. Doesn&#x27;t dry it out or make it oily. Btw a little bit goes a very long way. These bottles will last you quite a long time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Mary Kay Velocity Cleanser and Moisturizer. It was the first face wash system I used when I first started breaking out around my young teen years, but after going off of it I saw that nothing else really worked that well on my face as the Velocity cleansers did. I am so happy that I went back to using Velocity. It definitely has worked its magic and I feel more confident because of it.</li>
    <li> I have used countless products off the skin-care shelves and this has always worked the best. I used it for years as a teenager and absolutely loved it. It smells great too, very fresh-like. I started using other cleansers to see how well they worked even though I didn&#x27;t have acne anymore. I&#x27;ve had a few problem spots start showing up so I&#x27;m going back to it but this time I&#x27;m not using anything else!&lt;br /&gt;-G. Perdue</li>
    <li> I have tried every skin cleanser there is..I even tried proactive(what ever it was call)..and it does not work for my skin...this is the one and only kind of cleanser that works for me....thanks Mary kay...</li>
    <li> I started using this product, and my face felt so dry even after putting on the moisturizer. I have dry skin, so I usually have to put lotion on my face and I thought this would cover it, but obviously not. After a week of using it I developed dry patches on my face and my chin was unbearably itchy. I had to stop using this, and buy some moisturizing lotion. Thankfully when I started using another moisturizer the dry patches cleared up in a couple days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems finding a good cleanser that didn&#x27;t dry my face out and a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. This stuff has been great! Leaves my skin feeling so smooth!</li>
    <li> i am currently using another product that is advertised on tv all the time.&lt;br /&gt;for some reason it just wasnt working. my sister came to visit me and i tried her velocity cleanser and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;the next morning i saw immediate results! i love it!</li>
    <li> I used to have same cleansed few years ago, it was amazing. You need just one drop to wash your whole face, i had it for a long time. I was exited to get it again, but when I tried to wash my face with it, it did not wash it at all. I had a make up and after applying the cleanser on my face i do not feel clean at all, plus it takes many washes to wash away mascara. I am not happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!!!!!!!!!! :) Very Amazing!!!!!</li>
