      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and would recommend it for any of the uses that I mentioned: dry skin (specifically face/scalp), acne, hair/beard gel, and sun-burns.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not painful, but you can feel the stinging/tingly sensation.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true or not since my hair grows like a weed, but I did have a pretty awesome beard going using this stuff on it.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, not only reasonable</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good stuff and lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I found this product first at Dollar Tree!</li>
      <li>This is great to firm up the skin all over.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is worth</li>
      <li>i guess you can never get enough Vitamin E, and this is a very easy way to get it.</li>
      <li>seems like I have to order it instead of being able to find it in stores, and they sent twice what I ordered this last time (6 rather than 3 bottles)!  </li>
      <li>I would NEVER buy from these people again, but I really like the product!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re Exactly What iWanted.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind has to repeat daily to see the results, not overnight. :-)</li>
      <li>Get the real thing!</li>
      <li>I have ordered several of these over the years; great moisturizer for dry skin and also helps with scrapes and cuts.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much</li>
      <li>It was 4-5 inches before I had to cut it to look civilized for the corporate world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ran out, and discovered that it is no longer available in any of my local drugstores or mass market stores.</li>
      <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because my face and scalp turn into the Sahara Desert during the winters up in the North-East.</li>
      <li>It hydrates really well, and with continual use will fade all kinds if scars.</li>
      <li>I started using this last summer, and after a day at the beach, I&#x27;d apply a light layer of this stuff.</li>
      <li>This stuff really help a lot healing skin problems and use after shaving or epilating...</li>
      <li>also great for scars, had reduction that left scars from one side of my rib cage to the other, use this faithfully (not just because of the scars - have used it since I was in my early 20s)</li>
      <li>I have ordered this item in the past, and I LOVE it!</li>
      <li>After a very short time it&#x27;s not sticky or anything, clothing goes right on as if it&#x27;s not there, and NO SMELL!  </li>
      <li>Ok neither is a real gripe, especially the last one.  </li>
      <li>I mainly used it to help with my dry-scalp, so this was an added benefit.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied as usual with all my last orders, rec&#x27;d them very fast also.&lt;br /&gt;Chas</li>
      <li>In fact now I have to order a lot at a time because the demand in the family is so high.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t go that far, haha.</li>
      <li>once dry it isn&#x27;t sticky at all and has clean scent.</li>
      <li>Now when I get out of the shower I put some on my forearms &amp; back of my hands, shins, and top of feet, anywhere that tends to dry up &amp; blow away.  </li>
      <li>My son and nephews use this gel as an aftercare method for new tattoos and they recommend it to their friends.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than any cream I had purchased in the past.  </li>
      <li>I recently grabbed my curling iron by the hot part instead of the handle.  </li>
      <li>The first time I bought it, I used a different seller and had no problems.</li>
      <li>Has a little smell to it, but that fades quickly!</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to any one trying to clear their skin..</li>
      <li>When I tried to call, I was told &amp;#34;all operators are busy, but we&#x27;ll take your number&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>h&amp;egrave;r sunburn  wasn&#x27;t  red and sore  much to our shock.  </li>
      <li>so well, my family loves it so much, and that a bottle will last me a while and not stink me up when I use</li>
      <li>I have used it for nearly 20 years when I or my children are sunburned..</li>
      <li>Of COURSE nobody called me back, and it wasn&#x27;t until I sent an e-mail through Amazon that action was taken.</li>
      <li>I slathered Vitamin E Gel on my hand frequently for the rest of the day and had no redness or blisters the next day.</li>
      <li>Aside from having a weird smell, it is a nice lotion (gel).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it as gel before and it works pretty well for a messy look.</li>
      <li>The Vitamin-E was way down the list, with Water and Aloe Vera being the main ingredients.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very satisfied as usual with all my last orders, rec&#x27;d them very fast also.&lt;br /&gt;Chas</li>
    <li> great product for many things</li>
    <li> I have ordered this item in the past, and I LOVE it! It is not sticky or greasy, and can be used for a plethora of things! It hydrates really well, and with continual use will fade all kinds if scars. Has a little smell to it, but that fades quickly! The only problem I had was with the seller. The first time I bought it, I used a different seller and had no problems. This time I bought it from &amp;#34;cosmetic solutions&amp;#34;, and even though they advertised it as a &amp;#34;3 pack&amp;#34;, they sent only TWO with no explanation or anything! When I tried to call, I was told &amp;#34;all operators are busy, but we&#x27;ll take your number&amp;#34;. Of COURSE nobody called me back, and it wasn&#x27;t until I sent an e-mail through Amazon that action was taken. I would NEVER buy from these people again, but I really like the product! I will buy it from the seller I originally bought it from if they are still around.</li>
    <li> Use it for discoloration on my body.</li>
    <li> I have used Fruit of the Earth&#x27;s Vitamin E gel for healing the nasty red bumps that I get from shaving my legs. I ran out, and discovered that it is no longer available in any of my local drugstores or mass market stores. Help!  Amazon to the rescue! I was thrilled to find it available - in packaging of both one bottle or a three pack. I ordered the 3 pack to be sure I have it on hand. This is a great product - the gel smothes in to your skin easily, and goes to work right away. It truly does heal. Don&#x27;t confuse this gel with the Fruit of the Earth Vitamin E skin care cream that you can find at Walmart. They are not the same, and from my experience, the cream doesn&#x27;t work for healing - only moisturizing. Get the real thing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, it is not greasy on the hands. I have also used it on sun burns which were very bad. Keeping the skin moist with the lotion the skin healed quickly and even in my case did not peel which was amazing.</li>
    <li> This stuff is worth it&#x27;s weight in GOLD! I have used it for nearly 20 years when I or my children are sunburned.. I first found it in Florida after a horrible sunburn and the locals swear by it. If we get seriously burned we put this on at least four times a day until the red is gone then continue another week of at least twice a day and we NEVER peel! It helps heal the skin! My daughter is porcelain skinned and this actually kept her delicate skin from peeling at all! I also gave to my boss with instructions and she took it to the  Caribbean. She got a terrible burn on her face and stomach and used like I suggested and now she wants to buy stock in the company lol..once dry it isn&#x27;t sticky at all and has clean scent. (Although they did change the scent in the last 10-1/ years and I preferred the way it was) why does everyone have to change things..but this stuff is amazing</li>
    <li> We use this gel every day for our skin.  Recommend for anyone with dry skin or sunburn repair.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love this product, have used it for years.  It was delivered just as you said, May 15 it was here.  Thanks so much</li>
    <li> my dad has been looking for this forever and cant find it anywhere this is the best thing I could have forund</li>
    <li> I have ordered several of these over the years; great moisturizer for dry skin and also helps with scrapes and cuts.  I also use it on my face after daily washing; also takes the sting out of sunburns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year. It has a hint of a chemical-ish smell (hard to describe), but it&#x27;s not overwhelming or anything. The smell fades very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this because my face and scalp turn into the Sahara Desert during the winters up in the North-East. It didn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped on my scalp, but I think I may just need a stronger product (prescription or something). My hands dry out as well, but I use hand cream for that issue. I was hesitant to use that same cream on my face though since I have had acne problems in the past. This product doesn&#x27;t make me break-out, and it actually helps. It keeps my face hydrated and even works to lighten up dark spots and fade scars a bit. Nothing significant or life-changing, but it does have a bit of a noticeable impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When deciding to purchase this, I saw a guy saying that it was so good that he might even try it out for sex. I wouldn&#x27;t go that far, haha. It can sort of burn a bit sometimes. If your face is raw after exfoliating, for instance, it might sting briefly. It&#x27;s not painful, but you can feel the stinging/tingly sensation. It doesn&#x27;t take away from the product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying it to my face, it leaves a weird feeling on your hands. It&#x27;s as if you touched something sticky and it dried on it. Not like a sticky glue feeling, it&#x27;s hard to describe. I always just run my hands under water after as it&#x27;s uncomfortable to me. Again, it doesn&#x27;t take away from the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it as gel before and it works pretty well for a messy look. It&#x27;s not strong enough to do anything complex, but it gives you enough to work with for a little bit of styling. I mainly used it to help with my dry-scalp, so this was an added benefit. When I put it on my face I usually put some into my beard too. Gotta keep that bad-boy healthy and hydrated too. I read that Vitamin E helped promote hair growth. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true or not since my hair grows like a weed, but I did have a pretty awesome beard going using this stuff on it. It was 4-5 inches before I had to cut it to look civilized for the corporate world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I used it for sun-burns as well. I started using this last summer, and after a day at the beach, I&#x27;d apply a light layer of this stuff. It worked well and kept my skin from peeling. I don&#x27;t usually burn, but the few times I did, it kept me from peeling. Either way, it keeps my face hydrated and helps keep everything in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product and would recommend it for any of the uses that I mentioned: dry skin (specifically face/scalp), acne, hair/beard gel, and sun-burns.</li>
    <li> This gel is wonderful...it is not sticky and glides are so smooth!  It is so much better than any cream I had purchased in the past.  It helps with smoothing my skin and getting rid of the awful signs of surgery!  I would surely recommend this purchase to anyone who needs these results!</li>
    <li> I use this F.O.T.E. Vitamin E Gel literally every single day on my face and legs instead of using a moisturizer. It keeps my face looking healthy and fresh. Even though it&#x27;s such a good skin rejuvenator, it&#x27;s surprisingly light and clean, so no breakouts or oiliness for me :-) Also, this product is the *best* thing for sunburns! Can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
    <li> Glad I ordered the product.. Works well for oily skin.. I would recommend it to any one trying to clear their skin..</li>
    <li> on my third or so purchase.  i use this every day.  it&#x27;s good on your face; your body; on my chocolate lab&#x27;s elbow; it&#x27;s just a multipurpose gel that I can&#x27;t go without.  great for your legs and combating cellulite.....I&#x27;m a devoted user of this and I have no cellulite.  also great for scars, had reduction that left scars from one side of my rib cage to the other, use this faithfully (not just because of the scars - have used it since I was in my early 20s) and physicians are always impressed with how little scarring (raised or visible) I have.  It&#x27;s just a great moisturizer.  Mix it with others too.  I&#x27;ll buy again and again and again.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, not only reasonable but I have used it for a very long time - 12 years or so.  I found it a very long time ago at a pharmacy, then in Walmart - but for some reason those stores no longer carry - so I order through Amazon.  Next order coming up soon.  This is great to firm up the skin all over.  I put it in my hair also - keeps it nice and shiny.</li>
    <li> This product is slipping for some reason while the price is rising! I found this product first at Dollar Tree! $1.00 for 12 oz. Sometimes 16 oz. for $1.00! Now a lot more &amp; the product is much thinner &amp; seems to have more of an alcohol content. Looking for an alternative.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on the recommendation of a dear friend and I have not been disappointed.  Good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not able to get this product locally and have to buy it on-line, but it is certainly worth that small inconvenience.  Soothes and smooths skin -- excellent treatment for sunburn or other burns -- even works as a hair gel.</li>
    <li> we can no longer find this in our stores in north east connecticut and it works great for dry skin</li>
    <li> This  product  is the beat,  my granddaughter got badly  sunburn  and she  is very pale skined. We apply ed  vitamin  E and the next day h&amp;egrave;r sunburn  wasn&#x27;t  red and sore  much to our shock.  By all means buy this  product. ....</li>
    <li> great product and great delivery</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I was originally introduced to this product while going through radiation treatments.  This gel eased the discomfort along with the dryness caused by the treatments.  It also sped up the process of restoring the dark discoloration that comes from radiation.  My son and nephews use this gel as an aftercare method for new tattoos and they recommend it to their friends.</li>
    <li> I have used Vitamin E Gel for many years.  Great for cracked heals and on legs, arms and hands for dryness.  I have also used as a shaving gel for legs.  The very best use however is for sunburn.  It cures sunburn overnight.  Also for other burns.  I recently grabbed my curling iron by the hot part instead of the handle.  I slathered Vitamin E Gel on my hand frequently for the rest of the day and had no redness or blisters the next day.</li>
    <li> Aside from having a weird smell, it is a nice lotion (gel).  i guess you can never get enough Vitamin E, and this is a very easy way to get it. Besides myself, my husband, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter all use this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product for years. So glad I was able to find it again bc I couldn&#x27;t find it anymore.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product off and on for numerous years since I found it sometime before 2009 and I have to say it is the best aloe gel so far i have used it has a really pleasant smell kind of a soft maybe pear-peach or pear-apple smell not perfumey though and with the vitamin E it is excellent for your face skin just great stuff</li>
    <li> Very Happy Customer !! They&#x27;re Exactly What iWanted. Thank You.</li>
    <li> This stuff really help a lot healing skin problems and use after shaving or epilating... it helps scars which I had 7 surgeries past year and helps hide some scars. Keep in mind has to repeat daily to see the results, not overnight. :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good stuff and lasts a long time. I even use it on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product.  I&#x27;m a guy, but I guess I&#x27;ve reached the age where having my hands look like an alligator&#x27;s in the Winter no longer suits me.  So in my search for solutions to that I ran across this stuff almost a year ago, I immediately quit using any other lotion or cream.  Now when I get out of the shower I put some on my forearms &amp; back of my hands, shins, and top of feet, anywhere that tends to dry up &amp; blow away.  After a very short time it&#x27;s not sticky or anything, clothing goes right on as if it&#x27;s not there, and NO SMELL!  Just a faint Vitamin E smell at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now give this as gifts to the ladies in the family, and for once I&#x27;m getting them something they like!  In fact now I have to order a lot at a time because the demand in the family is so high.  I love this stuff, I love that it&#x27;s so cheap, works so well, my family loves it so much, and that a bottle will last me a while and not stink me up when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 gripes:  seems like I have to order it instead of being able to find it in stores, and they sent twice what I ordered this last time (6 rather than 3 bottles)!  Ok neither is a real gripe, especially the last one.  I&#x27;ll holler at their customer service though, I don&#x27;t want to cheat a company I&#x27;m so happy with.  :)</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed with the ingredient list.  The Vitamin-E was way down the list, with Water and Aloe Vera being the main ingredients.  Product was not what I was looking for.  I feel the product was not labeled correctly.</li>
