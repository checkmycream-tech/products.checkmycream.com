      <li>Peanuts and OPI nail polishes, my favorite things.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Okay, I am a Peanuts fan</li>
      <li>I love these polishes.</li>
      <li>FAST DELIVERY!!!</li>
      <li>Fun.</li>
      <li>I have had more fun with these colors and doing all kinds of peanuts related nail</li>
      <li>Got it fast!</li>
      <li>Still, it is a whole lot of fun to play with.</li>
      <li>Thankfully, it seems that they&#x27;ve learned from the past because my last couple purchases of mini sets have yielded great quality polishes that have applied as well as their full size counterparts.</li>
      <li>They are so little and cute!</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>really like the mini size of nail polishes, same quality but the possibility to try colors that I wouldn&#x27;t buy in full size.</li>
      <li>While the colors may not be a someones cup of tea, if you like a nice sunny yellow, black that applies without being patchy, and glitter</li>

    <li> Peanuts and OPI nail polishes, my favorite things.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the mini size of nail polishes, same quality but the possibility to try colors that I wouldn&#x27;t buy in full size.</li>
    <li> When I received my order the box was all smashed.</li>
    <li> I give 3 stars for the glitter polish and the black. Delivery was fast. The yellow polish (which I bought this for) is gummy and hard to apply.</li>

    <li> Okay, I am a Peanuts fan and I mean a FAN.  I have had more fun with these colors and doing all kinds of peanuts related nail are with.  This is a mini collection, not full size so be mindful of that Still, it is a whole lot of fun to play with.</li>
    <li> Great for a &amp;#34;Peanuts&amp;#34; fan. 4 small bottles of nail polish plus some a few nail stickers.  My kids aren&#x27;t big peanuts&#x27; fans but my girls like the black and yellow nail polish. Fun.</li>
    <li> OPI is always a favorite, when meshed with Peanuts you can&#x27;t go wrong. I loved the decals that came with as an added bonus. :)</li>
    <li> OPI used to have notorious consistency issues with their mini bottles. Thankfully, it seems that they&#x27;ve learned from the past because my last couple purchases of mini sets have yielded great quality polishes that have applied as well as their full size counterparts. While the colors may not be a someones cup of tea, if you like a nice sunny yellow, black that applies without being patchy, and glitter that is whimsical -not run of the mill- go nuts and pick up this peanuts set!&lt;br /&gt;Great mini set!</li>
    <li> Gifts for teenage friends.</li>
    <li> Great colors, bought for a gift and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I love these!!! The colors are so great, as well as the glitter!! I love the combination, it is a great set that truely portraits Peanuts!</li>
