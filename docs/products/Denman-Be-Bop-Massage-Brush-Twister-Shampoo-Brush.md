      <li>Finding this one on Amazon, and one with perfect length bristles that just glides along and brings a wonderful soft massage to my head as I&#x27;m washing my hair is just great.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Oh how I wish amazon would just let you say it&#x27;s a good brush and let it go at that.</li>
      <li>Looks cheep and doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
      <li>For good measure, this should be done to each end of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>

      <li>Works great and my scalp feels so much better.</li>

      <li>SURE!..</li>
      <li>but I love it!</li>
      <li>and I would like to say that this product works nicely.</li>
      <li>This is a really nice scalp massager</li>
      <li>However, I have not been able to find them anywhere else,so I guess it is priced fairly.</li>
      <li>(yes I&#x27;m the kind of person who even researches brushes), but kept hearing the name again and again.</li>
      <li>Although slightly soft, it works the hair and the scalp the best way.  </li>
      <li>Nothing fancy, but effective and comfortable for use.</li>
      <li>Love these brushes to use in the shower when I wash my hair or when using conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Review from my wife: I&#x27;ve used these for years and love them.</li>
      <li>The search continues for one I will love to use.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok for now.  </li>
      <li>the one I got from my barber for 1 usd is a lot better</li>
      <li>It works just OK.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them.  </li>
      <li>This is a replacement for a brush that I&#x27;ve had for many years.</li>
      <li>Love the scrubbing rubber prongs on the massagers, penetrating better in the scalp.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than most.</li>
      <li>I have psoriasis and therefore have a lot of flaking but with this get to remove it mostly.</li>
      <li>There is not point in me returning this brush shipping would be more than I paid</li>
      <li>I use this for shampooing my beard and love it.</li>
      <li>Would be better if it was all one piece.  </li>
      <li>MORE WORDS REQUIRED</li>
      <li>Still, glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>Get to the &amp;#34;root&#x27; of your dandruff problems with a good shampoo and this useful scrubber.</li>
      <li>It is fused onto the brush and is more sturdy and stays on longer.  </li>
      <li>I have an itchy scalp and this helps my scalp feel better.</li>
      <li>Way better than scratching your head with fingernails.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I also remember reading somewhere that you should try gripping it in your palm, rather than using the handle, and found that advice to be helpful in achieving a stronger scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>believed a was buying a newer, more improved version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It was easy to handle and fine for the scalp!</li>
      <li>The sturdiness of this particular product for my hair type was just remarkable.</li>
      <li>Good quality soft shampoo brush distribute very nice shampoo and gently massaging scalp...</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>and they are easy to wash out.</li>
      <li>but I use it just as a simple hairbrush that feels nice on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to help with circulation on your scalp which is probably good for your hear and skin.</li>
      <li>Besides, you can buy a tangle teezer or its analogs for $5 anywhere, so this thing is nothing special in comparison, and doesn&#x27;t do a better job.</li>
      <li>Use it all the time, easy to hold and a smooth brush.</li>
      <li>Send me an offer that I cannot refuse and I will most certainly order more of these Denman Be-Bop Massage Brush Model D6, I am not kidding - make me an offer.</li>
      <li>Made of cheap plastic that feels like it will break soon.  </li>
      <li>available - but over-priced</li>
      <li>The description should reflect the color, this is important too.</li>
      <li>Seemed totally cheap when arrived, but I get it.</li>
      <li>This brush is effective, yet gentle.  </li>
      <li>Smooth edges</li>
      <li>This was the favored of the several types and brands we tried.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Anyway, don&#x27;t know how much more there is to write about a scalp/shampoo brush, but hopefully it was useful</li>
      <li>Gets the shampoo right where it&#x27;s needed most.</li>
      <li>I have fine, curly hair that snarls at the slightest mussing, and I use this brush to help my scalp stay clean and my hair untangled.  </li>
      <li>have small hands my fingers fit perfectly under the handle</li>
      <li>the Denman Be-Bop, the manufacturer says &amp;#34;Do not immerse in hot water or use with a hair dryer.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s probably a good idea to avoid high heat with either brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>One of the big problems with dandruff shampoos is that they need something like this scrubber to work most effectively.</li>
      <li>Good hair massage brush especially to use spreading any hair treatment including shampoo, conditioner or others.</li>
      <li>The pins are too short to give a good massage to a head with longer hair or lots of hair.</li>
      <li>The bristles are really flexible, so I&#x27;m sure people like these too.</li>
      <li>Anyhow, glad I bit the bullet because this one has the longer bristles and can really dig in to the scalp if you want it too.</li>
      <li>I purchased this brush for my daughter who has mild psoriasis and gets some build up on her scalp.  </li>
      <li>all, this is a good shampoo brush but be prepared to do minor surgery on it.</li>
      <li>My husband loves it; I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s exactly what he was looking for!</li>
      <li>I love this little brush, it gives your scalp a good massage and the price is very affordable.  </li>
      <li>Denmans are distinct for their quality.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, this is worth the $3.90 I paid for.</li>
      <li>This brush has a wide strap type handle that I was able to slip my entire palm through, (but my husband could only fit two fingers), which provided an excellent grasp.</li>

    <li> Nice handle and good shape of bristles make this brush great for scalp massage.  I use it daily .</li>
    <li> Out of the three scalp/shampoo thingamajigs I&#x27;ve tried, this is without a doubt the best one so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m a male with short curly hair that is thick, coarse, and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need a \\&quot;massage\\&quot; brush, I need a scrubber to remove dead skin cells, flakes, and shedding hair. After trying a Swissco from that online store who specializes in toiletries and other things people buy at a \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot;, which was pathetic and broke after a few months, I came to see what Amazon had to offer. Went with that purple Scalpmaster one, rocked it for a few months. It was aiight, but wanted something with longer bristles that was sturdier and tougher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a dude, so no clue who or what Denman was before doing my research (yes I&#x27;m the kind of person who even researches brushes), but kept hearing the name again and again. It was on my wishlist cause think at the time it was double the price and was either not shipped via Prime, not sold by Amazon.com, or not an add-on item, or all of the above, can&#x27;t really remember. Anyhow, glad I bit the bullet because this one has the longer bristles and can really dig in to the scalp if you want it too. I also remember reading somewhere that you should try gripping it in your palm, rather than using the handle, and found that advice to be helpful in achieving a stronger scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, don&#x27;t know how much more there is to write about a scalp/shampoo brush, but hopefully it was useful, otherwise I just wasted my time.</li>
    <li> This is the first brush I ever bought but I love it! I don&#x27;t use it every day, maybe 2-3 times a week. It gets rid on my occasional dry scalp and the little waxy balls that build up on my scalp at the roots. I use shampoo and then use the brush with the shampoo, makes a great lather! Great product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush for my daughter who has mild psoriasis and gets some build up on her scalp.  This brush was great for her to massage the shampoo in her scalp and as a result was able to remove some of the build up from her scalp.  Good buy!</li>
    <li> soft brush!!! great for dandruff control..</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and I would like to say that this product works nicely. Firstly, I have really bad dandruff and it&#x27;s worse during the cold season. I used this scalp brush tonight and I say that this brush helped get rid of the thick flakes on my scalp. I can imagine this brush would be awesome for prepooing your hair, but I would have to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I expected this brush to be a bit bigger than was it is. Otherwise, this is worth the $3.90 I paid for.</li>
    <li> My daughter took it from her brother! Nice long massaging bristles. This was the favored of the several types and brands we tried.</li>
    <li> This brush is the closest thing to perfection that I have found.  Although slightly soft, it works the hair and the scalp the best way.  Best among those that I have tried.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and love them.  I color my hair and this help with the conditioner with combing through my hair to get out the tangles.</li>
    <li> Love the scrubbing rubber prongs on the massagers, penetrating better in the scalp. It&#x27;s better than most.</li>
    <li> Looks cheep and doesn&#x27;t feel good.</li>
    <li> KMT! So want back my money! I did not get the brush that was advertised.</li>
    <li> Ha, my cat LOVES these brushes, so I have three stashed around the house.  The bristles are really flexible, so I&#x27;m sure people like these too.</li>
    <li> *Great for Scalp Massage and Shampooing in the Shower!.. I had to come back to order.. &amp;#34;TWO More!&amp;#34;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TWO MORE WORDS REQUIRED THAT&#x27;s why I hate to write a review and rarely do!.. Won&#x27;t be back to write another one.. 4 SURE!..</li>
    <li> Seemed totally cheap when arrived, but I get it. Did work better than the others, push as hard or soft as you want and use as detangler. I use it to put extra extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil on my scalp and after sits for a minute massage in with this, lift away blocked hair folicle dandruff, and thicker healthier hair, plus, dont wash out all the way and great compiment to conditioner while keeping scalp healthy longer!</li>
    <li> Review from my wife: I&#x27;ve used these for years and love them. I have very curly very thick hair and like to use this to scrub my scalp with shampoo in it. Then I use it in the shower while I have conditioner in to comb out my hair.</li>
    <li> it is shorten the time I spent to wash my hair,I am confident the my scalp and hair are clean,I will order it again for my friend.</li>
    <li> I do not like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believed a was buying a newer, more improved version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not recommend.[[ASIN:B0000YUX4E Denman Be-Bop Shampoo Brush (D6)]]</li>
    <li> It is too stiff. It \\&quot;scratches\\&quot; my head. I threw it away. I looked and looked for a good shampooer and after months I was unable to find one - until I decided to get a cat. In the brush section for dogs, I found one that works perfectly - the rubber like bristles are not too soft and not too hard. It is much better than shampooing with your relatively big fat fingers! The brand name is Martha Stewart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: after searching for quite a while and finding nothing good, I stumbled across a great product! It has rubber \\&quot;bristles\\&quot; with each one rounded at the end. Just the right amount of firmness. I found it at PETSMART. It is supposed to be used for washing dogs, but it&#x27;s great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to add the following to all my reviews:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware! Some \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; will trash a product for no reason simply because they are paid to or because they sell competitive products. Other \\&quot;reviewers\\&quot; will give products - that they have never seen and never used - glowing 5 star ratings - for a fee.  Some honest reviewers do not understand what a product is for or how to use it and will trash a product simply because they are just plain dumb.</li>
    <li> works great when giving the mutts a shower</li>
    <li> Good quality soft shampoo brush distribute very nice shampoo and gently massaging scalp...</li>
    <li> Yeah, its a brush.  Made of cheap plastic that feels like it will break soon.  Charge a $1 for this thing....not 8.</li>
    <li> Feels very good on my scalp.  I have an itchy scalp and this helps my scalp feel better.</li>
    <li> Purchased this brush and it arrived quickly (which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars) however this brush is a simple flimsy cheap piece plastic and I have purchased better than this at the Dollar store for less than a $1.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t delved into this to see if this is an imitation but having used other Denman products (which are a bit more pricey, btw) this certainly raises a brow.&lt;br /&gt;I certainly would NOT recommend it, ESPECIALLY FOR THICK HAIR (the brush would break and get lost, lol) nor would I purchase it for this price I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it for less. Pic looks much more sturdy but this brush is Not sturdy, in fact it isn&#x27;t even shaped the same as the one on the picture (the one received is a circle, the pic is an oval)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The item was eggzackly as described.  Not innovative.  Standard plastic shampoo brush.  Similar to my old one, which somehow disappeard.</li>
    <li> The picture looks like it&#x27;s something more than the average flimsy brush you can get in any Rite Aid store for less $.</li>
    <li> Excellent to make shampoo foam and saves fingernails.</li>
    <li> Good product!  Works well.  I would have given a 6th star, if the back loop were narrower (made for 1 or 2 fingers instead of 3 or 4 fingers).  It was a little awkward to use until I figured out how to make it a little more comfortable to grip.</li>
    <li> good due to the travel size</li>
    <li> Like most shampoo brushes, the bristles are too stiff.  If you like stiff bristles, this may suit you.  Not for me.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a shampoo brush that actually works. I finally found it. This product works. Period! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This brush is durable, does not hurt your head, gives a great head massage.&lt;br /&gt;I have small hands my fingers fit perfectly under the handle grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend your money on more expensive massage brushes till you have at least tried this one first.</li>
    <li> I use this for shampooing my beard and love it. Its teeth are rounded on the tips so they don&#x27;t scratch painfully like some I&#x27;ve used in the past have. It&#x27;s just a simple, black, plastic brush.  The angle of that photo made me question the shape of the handle but it&#x27;s a simple strap handle like you see on the backs of most shower brushes. Nothing fancy, but effective and comfortable for use.</li>
    <li> Works great and my scalp feels so much better.</li>
    <li> The brush is advertised as the D6 Denman brush but this is a dishonest description on the part of the seller. This is NOT a Denman brush! It is a similar shaped but generically made fake. If I had known I would not have purchased it because I have a Denman D6 and was getting another one for my sister. Denmans are distinct for their quality. There is not point in me returning this brush shipping would be more than I paid so I&#x27;ll just keep it.</li>
    <li> I have psoriasis and therefore have a lot of flaking but with this get to remove it mostly. i also use it to brush my hair in the mornings</li>
    <li> Good hair massage brush especially to use spreading any hair treatment including shampoo, conditioner or others. Smooth edges so you you do not feel it</li>
    <li> delivered item different then in the picture. the one I got from my barber for 1 usd is a lot better then this crap</li>
    <li> This is only a cheap little thing but with shipping is a little expensive.  However, I have not been able to find them anywhere else,so I guess it is priced fairly.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes to use in the shower when I wash my hair or when using conditioner.  The&#x27;re also great to use when putting color in your hair and they are easy to wash out.</li>
    <li> the bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or too hard, just right.  I have had several other scalp massage brushes and they were mostly too hard.  This one has bristles that are stiff enough to get the job done but not so hard that they are uncomfortable.  Also, they aren&#x27;t so pointed that they scratch too hard.  Not so with this one.  I am very satisfied with this brush.</li>
    <li> I bought this item to assist with deep scalp scrubbing as I suffer with persistent acne on my scalp due to a hormone imbalance. It works well, the only thing I would note is that if your head is really sensitive for whatever reason (mine being Pilar Cysts), it may be too hard of bristle for you.</li>
    <li> This brush is effective, yet gentle.  I have developed a scalp condition that requires shampooing my scalp 3 time s a week.  This brush removes scales but is flexible enough not to irritate the condition.</li>
    <li> It may be a small and insignificant item, but for what it is, it works.  I have fine, curly hair that snarls at the slightest mussing, and I use this brush to help my scalp stay clean and my hair untangled.  I&#x27;ve had it now for over a month and while I don&#x27;t roughly rake it through my hair, it has not had any bristles break off and the handle is intact, which is more than I can say for the more expensive ConAir hair brush I use outside of the shower...&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost like regular tangle teezer, but without low level of pins, smaller, and less convenient to use. Besides, you can buy a tangle teezer or its analogs for $5 anywhere, so this thing is nothing special in comparison, and doesn&#x27;t do a better job. The pins are too short to give a good massage to a head with longer hair or lots of hair. May be it will work for somebody with short hair. Besides, the image shows a nice platina color, and the product I received is black. Ewww. The description should reflect the color, this is important too. So, overall, I am displeased with the product.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for a brush that I&#x27;ve had for many years. The old one just started falling apart. The new one is small enough to take with me on trips and works well. Oh how I wish amazon would just let you say it&#x27;s a good brush and let it go at that.</li>
    <li> I worked at a salon 30+ years ago and was introduced to these. since then I use them all the time.. great on the scalp and really good on the beard/stache..</li>
    <li> Feels great, not too expensive. The handle can come loose (happened once) and snapped back on. Would be better if it was all one piece.  Still, glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Use it all the time, easy to hold and a smooth brush. I got an extra one in the car</li>
    <li> I like the brush when washing my hair</li>
    <li> I like this head scrubber because it really gets down to my scalp.</li>
    <li> Love this little massage brush!  I&#x27;m going to buy one for my sons and husband  as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.  PERFECT !!!!!</li>
    <li> Cleans my scalp with just about any type of shampoo. It is awesome.</li>
    <li> I use this to apply my psoriasis shampoo to my scalp. Love it. Way better than scratching your head with fingernails.</li>
    <li> The sturdiness of this particular product for my hair type was just remarkable.</li>
    <li> I use this occasionally when I take my morning showers and I&#x27;m feeling a little itchy or want a bit more pressure on my scalp. There are a lot of bristles to cover the whole area of the scalp. It is easy to use. Dab shampoo over your head, give it a thorough rinse around with your hand, and then use the brush. Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m not used to using such a brush but it does get a little painful if I use it for more often than a day.</li>
    <li> Denman hairbrush was very good! I give it 4 stars! And I would like to see other similar hairbrushproducts! It was easy to handle and fine for the scalp!</li>
    <li> available - but over-priced</li>
    <li> Good Quality, great price!</li>
    <li> I was hoping the bristles would be longer because I have very thick hair, but I love the way it feels on the scalp.</li>
    <li> It works just OK. The bristles are not deep enough and it is made really cheap for the price charged.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for now.  The search continues for one I will love to use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves it; I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s exactly what he was looking for!</li>
    <li> Did not meet the expectations I had thought very flimsy cheaply made, disappointing.</li>
    <li> One of the big problems with dandruff shampoos is that they need something like this scrubber to work most effectively. This one&#x27;s firm enough to clean the scalp thoroughly, yet it&#x27;s gentle enough to keep from scratching your scalp in the process. It&#x27;s also durable, so you won&#x27;t be looking for a new on in a couple of weeks. Get to the &amp;#34;root&#x27; of your dandruff problems with a good shampoo and this useful scrubber.</li>
    <li> This brush has done a great job over the 2 years I&#x27;ve owned it. The bristles are firm and long enough to clean and massage my head/scalp. This item does an equal job with my beard and mustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative comment I can make on this brush is the handle. In the first week of use, one side of the handle popped out of the brush. The handle is a second piece of plastic that is set in place by friction pins. This is the weak link and can be fixed &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; with a roofing nail and a candle flame to melt the backside of the pin to the brush. For good measure, this should be done to each end of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is a good shampoo brush but be prepared to do minor surgery on it.</li>
    <li> I really like the brush.  It does not tangle my hair!!!!</li>
    <li> This gives my scalp a good scrubbing which is harder to do when you have long hair sometimes. I sometimes use medicated shampoo and I feel like this brush really lets the shampoo penetrate my scalp. I like the way the bristles feel as well. I slide my hand under the handle and massage away!</li>
    <li> My husband loves these to use while washing his hair. They are simply perfect and he says that nothing else works quite like these. We will definitely be buying again.</li>
    <li> This massage brush is exactly what I was looking for.  It works wonderfully on my scalp and for my long wet hair in the shower.</li>
    <li> It works as long as you are easy and gentle on your wet hair.</li>
    <li> This is not worth fifty cents... never mind over five dollars.  It is made of the thinnest plastic I have ever seen and I am very disappointed.  It&#x27;s not worth the money to ship it back for a credit, so my advice is to not order this product.</li>
    <li> been looking all over for a head scrubber&lt;br /&gt;I have MS and weak hands&lt;br /&gt;perfect for shampooing&lt;br /&gt;I leave it in the shower</li>
    <li> Fits hand great, massages scalp, spreads creams,.&lt;br /&gt;Does what it&#x27;s advertised for so much better than other similar items  i&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Most people think the only way to exfoliate your scalp is at a salon but in all honesty its not rocket science. Take one of these I bought this one because as a man a rainbow colored one would get laughed at by anyone in my bathroom, a nice scalp exfoliator and then a scalp toner and feel your scalp breath again its just like the skin on your face it needs a little attention every now and then y&#x27;all.</li>
    <li> I usually love Denman products but this one was not much different than what I could buy at the local department store. Now that I look at it carefully after seeing the product in hand, I can see I made the mistake. The product is as pictured.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s hard to hold. the plastic is very stiff, the bristles are more pointed than round.  this is less of a \\&quot;head massager\\&quot; and more of a very cheap plastic brush.  would be worth the money but only if you bought it at the dollar store.</li>
    <li> The handle on this brush will not stay anchored in its slot, making it very difficult to use as designed. This brush is a cheap, plastic, overpriced and useless item. Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;Is this really a Denman?&lt;br /&gt;The seller, Invanity, refuses to take the useless thing back, citing some bogus health reasons.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have to resell it.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t use them again!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice scalp massager but I use it just as a simple hairbrush that feels nice on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to help with circulation on your scalp which is probably good for your hear and skin.</li>
    <li> it works ok, not as soft as a previous same type.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this sort of a scalp massager for a long time - mostly as a detangler for my long hair.  I wanted an extra one for my gym bag and bought this one.  My only complaint is that the the small gap where the handles attaches to the &#x27;brush&#x27; hangs onto my hair when I try to remove the hair after brushing.  Would prefer a one piece molded design.</li>
    <li> I had bought 4 different shampoo/massage brushes just to compare. Now a shampoo/massage brush is a product that is a preferential choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried out the Scalpmaster Brush, the Kent Brush, the Century Scalp Massage Brush, and the Denman Be-Bop Massage Brush. The Denman Brush came packaged in an open box type container. From the image advertised and the price, I thought that the brush would be more substantial than it is; however, it is very similar to the Scalpmaster that is about 20% less expensive. This brush is round, not oval as the image suggests, but now that I have the product, I see that it is the photography that is distorted. This brush has a wide strap type handle that I was able to slip my entire palm through, (but my husband could only fit two fingers), which provided an excellent grasp. The handle also works well for hanging on a hook when not in use. I used/tested the brush and these are my results. First, I lather up my shampoo and then using the brush, I massaged in small circular motions, applying a small amount of pressure. The bristles/tines although a little stiff, felt good against my scalp until I reached a small patch in the back of my head in which I have some mild psoriasis. The Denman brush irritated that part, whereas the Scalpmaster Brush that has slightly shorter tines actually felt good in this same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the four-compared shampoo/massage brushes got tangled in my thick, past shoulder length hair, and all the brushes rinse out fast and easily. I like a good hard massage that I received from the Scalpmaster Brush. My husband liked the Denman Brush with the slightly longer bristles/tines. My son liked the Century Scalp Massage Brush that has much stiffer bristles/tines that I found to be painful and the Kent Brush I gave to a close friend who does have a sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have written four separate reviews on each shampoo/massage brush tested, and in each, I have tried to provide some insight regarding any flaws or benefits. However, as I previously stated in the beginning of this review, a shampoo/massage brush is an individual choice, subjective to personal preferences. I hope that each of my reviews are helpful and will help you narrow down which brush would best suit your needs.arding any flaws or benefits.

    <li> I love and use it everyday!</li>
    <li> Send me an offer that I cannot refuse and I will most certainly order more of these Denman Be-Bop Massage Brush Model D6, I am not kidding - make me an offer.</li>
    <li> Feels real good on your scalp. Gets the shampoo right where it&#x27;s needed most.</li>
    <li> Except for the handle style, the Denman Be-Bop massage brush is very similar to the FMS 100 Century Shampoo Massage brush.  Both have soft plastic bristles (that are softer than most other similar shampoo/massage brushes) and both can penetrate throught the hair down to the scalp with relative ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weakest part of both brushes is the &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Denman&#x27;s handle is a larger loop that fits over 3 or 4 fingers and is attached with pointed pegs at each end of the handle that click into small holes on the brush.  If you use the brush with any vigor the handle pops off but it can be popped back on -- at least until the pegs and holes start to wear and get loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 Century brush has a smaller loop that fits over 1 finger.  It is fused onto the brush and is more sturdy and stays on longer.  But with continued vigourous use, it too snaps off eventually and there is no effective way to reattach it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Denman Be-Bop, the manufacturer says &amp;#34;Do not immerse in hot water or use with a hair dryer.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s probably a good idea to avoid high heat with either brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Denman and 100 Century brush are quite similar, but I a have a slight preference for the 100 Century brush.</li>
    <li> Been searching for one of these things to replace the one I&#x27;ve had for years, but forgot where I got it.  Finding this one on Amazon, and one with perfect length bristles that just glides along and brings a wonderful soft massage to my head as I&#x27;m washing my hair is just great.&lt;br /&gt;A minor life problem, solved now, forever!  Thank you, Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this little brush, it gives your scalp a good massage and the price is very affordable.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy them again.</li>
    <li> Definitely not the item promised</li>
</ol>
