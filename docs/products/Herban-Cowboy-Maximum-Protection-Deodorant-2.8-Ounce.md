<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all. I was still sweating, which I expected since it&#x27;s human nature and natural to sweat, but I was still getting a horrible odor. Pretty much felt like I wasn&#x27;t wearing deodorant at all. I switched to a different 100% natural deodorant that comes in a jar and now I am sweating with no more odor.</li>
    <li> The only natural deo that works for me! ITs best to apply 2x per day</li>
    <li> After about 5 days of what could be considered obsessive research, I settled on this product. First off, the packaging is very nice and has a very masculine presentation. The scent is perfect in my opinion as its not overpowering, smells very natural, and is what I feel a male should smell like. The scent level is one in which the only time someone is going to smell it is very close contact, which is what I look for in a deodorant(I&#x27;m not buying cologne here) ... oh, and it doesn&#x27;t clash or compete for &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; attention with my colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual performance of the product is excellent. I apply immediately after drying off post-shower and it keeps my particularly pungent odor at bay. Sometimes stretching out its effective range to two days, it has still stayed strong under the wetness and generally manly underarm abuse. Definitely will buy again and I am extremely happy with this brand in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;potato</li>
    <li> I use this as an adult female human, and I love the smell. It definitely works for men or women, and it works infinitely better for me than Tom&#x27;s deodorant.</li>
    <li> I love Herban Cowboy products, but this one does not quite have a forest smell nor a small I liked.</li>
    <li> not much of a smell and this doesn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, not too strong, nice odor, and natural.</li>
    <li> Smells fine. Doesn&#x27;t work. Boooooo.</li>
    <li> I just started using this deodorant around a month ago and am more or less impressed by it. Very good smell and overall feel to it. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I have to reapply around halfway through the day. Other then that it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
    <li> Pleasant, natural smell. Only lasts 3-4 hours on me.</li>
    <li> Forest smells a lot better to me than Dusk and the other scents offered by Herban Cowboy. I wish they would make a soap bar with this scent.</li>
    <li> This product will not even last till you get home from work.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t get too sweaty but was looking for a deodorant that would actually work, not contain harmful chemicals, and if it had a good smell that would be a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Deodorant does all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in South Florida and deodorant is a must at all times. Haven&#x27;t had any stress sweat either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients speak for themselves. Only thing is if your your pits are a bit wet when you apply it, it will run a bit and may get sticky further down your side or arm. But that is expected with a deodorant of this time. I used to use Tom&#x27;s that stuff was horrible and would leave all sorts of residue. No complaints on the residue here and I slab it on well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great. I can easily smell it through a single layer. Its a bit stronger than expected but I don&#x27;t mind as it brings me satisfaction knowing I smell great. It is a bit woodsy with a spicy bite. I like to pair it with a sweet/citrus cologne for a nice woodsy and citrus combo. I&#x27;ve been happy since. Ordering another stick so I don&#x27;t run out. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> The smell is good, the scent though is not strong and it doesn&#x27;t last a whole day.  It is clear with a greenish tint, and when you put it on it is great at first, but it loses its staying power, I&#x27;m talking a normal working day with no extra athletic or post work activity.  I applaud their efforts and the attempt to be natural and get away from the big chemicals, but you need to keep the stick close in order to apply more than once in a day.</li>
    <li> Alright, I have to give Herban Cowboy props of this one. I wrote a bad review for dusk because the scent is almost good, but kind of burns/irritates the throat. Forest, on the other hand, does not have this problem, but it does have a great light masculine scent. Surpisingly, it also has what I&#x27;d describe as a &#x27;foresty&#x27; scent too and it doesn&#x27;t smell too harsh or chemically -- It also seems to last at least 8 hours for me. I don&#x27;t know how you did it Herban Cowboy, but good job. I appreciate you making deodorants that smell good without detriment to one&#x27;s heath -- excluding terrible ingredients like aluminum and propelyne glycol. if you&#x27;re aiming to make a better deodorant, then forest is definitely the standard to beat.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a week and broke out in a major rash under both arms. Natural my ass.</li>
    <li> Works great, and great smell.</li>
    <li> I used to use Tom&#x27;s O.M. woodspice. They changed their product and it smelled heavily of patchouli. Not a fan. This deodorant has answered the call.</li>
    <li> Great to find a healthy men&#x27;s deodorant that smells good too.</li>
    <li> I noticed a smell after a couple of hours working.  I was hoping this would work better for me, although results may vary with different people.</li>
    <li> Product has less chemicals however it doesn&#x27;t hold up to exercising and sweating, still smell bad.  The deodorant doesn&#x27;t smell very good but is tolerable. Its relatively only 1/2 to 2/3rds size of regular deodorant sticks (2 oz vs 4 oz).  I probably will try something else in future.</li>
    <li> Does the trick for me!</li>
    <li> I initially loved this natural product, but after a few weeks my body &amp;#34;got used to it&amp;#34; and I started to smell badly. I&#x27;ve tried the crystal deodorants and they suck, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good deodorant that actually works and doesn&#x27;t make me smell is Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant.... IT IS AMAZING. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with deoderant irritating my skin - no issues with this stuff though! Smells good too, kind of like green wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative I can see is it doesn&#x27;t last as long as many other brands but I&#x27;ll gladly sacrifice some duration for a massive improvement in comfort.</li>
    <li> Turns out I&#x27;m allergic to this organic stuff, broke out in a massive rash after using this deodorant. I have no other allergies so I&#x27;m surprised I had a bad reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells pretty good though.</li>
    <li> Smells great and keeps smelling great all day. This will be my new &amp;#34;ggo to&amp;#34; deodorant for quite a while.</li>
    <li> My husband is sensitive to regular deoderant and we&#x27;ve tried all brands of the natural kind. This is the only one that actually works for him. It not only keeps odor at bay, it smells great.</li>
    <li> Herban Cowboy does deodorant right after trying toms and Jason this is the real deal. Love the scent lasts most of the day will need to reapply if doing strenuous activities.</li>
    <li> Ok but smell doesn&#x27;t last long, not worth the price or applying multiple times a day</li>
    <li> Smells good and works well.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance with all day protection.  Cologne is not tested on animals and comes from a line of products that are durable and present themselves as refreshing colognes, soaps and odor protectors.</li>
    <li> I decided to give up on anti-perspirants several months ago because I was tired of those yellow arm pit stains on my t-shirts.  I discovered Herban Cowboy Forest and have been happy every since.  My t-shirts stay white while I stay smelling fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> My husband, who has never used anything but Gillette gel, loves the scent. He wants to know if they sell a cologne to match! As for effectiveness, I am hopeful. He has used it over a week now. He works in construction, and while it is December, it is also the South, so we have had a couple of 70 degree days, and even with his hound dog nose and high standards of hygiene, he likes it.</li>
    <li> This smells great - not overpowering at all. Definitely will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> By and large the best natural deodorant in the market.</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant I have tried. Works better than most, I do not sweat or stink at end of the day. Only needs to be applied in the morning. The biggest compliment I have is that these stick lasts twice as long as the others. Definitely worth the value by far easily 5 star!! Just buy. Only small gripe is the deodorant tends to slide back down when using so you have to hold the adjustment knob on the bottom while applying.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like it; it smells great unless you wear it for longer than 10 hours; and then BO kicks in hard.  No other deodorant (usual Old Spice, Degree) has failed me like this.  God forbid you wear it all day and then go do a workout.  You end up smelling like a stale bag of Fritos with some onions mixed in...</li>
    <li> My favorite Herban Cowboy scent. I also love the Dusk, but this one edges it by just a bit. It is not an antipersperant, but you probably already know that. I apply once in the morning and once at lunch, but it&#x27;s probably not really needed if you work in a professional setting. Lasts all day inside.</li>
    <li> Convinced my husband to try a more natural deodorant. So far, he loves it. I do too, as the smell is quite refreshing, yet manly. Overall we are very satisfied with the product.</li>
    <li> Husband purchased and thoroughly recommends!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with scent and performance of the Herban Cowboy Forest Deodorant. Will never go back to over the counter brands.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last long on a humid day, I smelled like I&#x27;d been living in the forest all week.&lt;br /&gt;Back to my old spice stick.</li>
    <li> Others said this will make you smell more manly.  Not true.  If you actually are manly then this is not for you.  It smells like a perfume factory.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s on ok deodorant - nothing really positive OR negative about it.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing that compelled me to buy it again though.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price would purchase this product again. It Last all day and smells great. First time buyer of this product.</li>
    <li> Herban Cowboy Forest Deodorant has a scent that is a combination of pine needles, earth, moss and a chai tea latte.  The smell is not overwhelming and does decrease throughout the day.  In the morning upon application, it is very fragrant, but not overwhelming.  By the end of the day, you can still smell the scent, but the coverage has significantly declined.  Despite the decline, this deodorant has worked to cover my funk - but YMMV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant comes in a standard container and is like a semi-hard wax.  When you apply the deodorant, it goes on with a wax/paste consistency that leaves your underarms a little &amp;#34;wet &amp; sticky.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s not a bad feeling, but it does take a little to get used to.  However, the feeling does fade throughout the day and the underarm deodorant does moisturize significantly (contains aloe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many people may complain that the deodorant contains potassium alum which is an astringent used by men after shaving to slow blood from cuts/weepers.  They may be confusing molecule with aluminum chloride which is used in antiperspirants.  Although both contain aluminum - humans consume aluminum every day by eating and the amount absorbed by deodorant is just a minor fraction of that total.  Potassium alum, which this deodorant contains, is not an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this deodorant has worked for me this winter - will update the review if it stops working when the temperature and humidity is out of control this summer.</li>
    <li> I give this 5 stars because it was way better than I expected it would be.  It works well enough.  I have to apply twice a day but i rather do that then use the aluminum, chemical deodorants.  The smell is woodsy, and the product is smooth</li>
    <li> This stuff is good as far as natural deodorant goes. The smell is really nice. However, don&#x27;t let anyone fool you that ANY natural deodorant (I&#x27;ve tried all the best) works as well as the chemical laden antiperspirants available at the supermarket. Because they don&#x27;t. This one doesn&#x27;t stop sweat at all, and the odor protection wears off for me rather quickly, in maybe half a day. I only wear it when it doesn&#x27;t really matter if I sweat much or smell a little bit. Like at night or if I&#x27;m going to work out. If I need real performance, I go with a high quality Speed Stick or Dove Men&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> smells great, no irritation</li>
    <li> I like this! Lets be real. No deodorant will last all day. This one lasts during the workday, and it has a mild, unobtrusive, woodsy smell. I like it, as does my husband.</li>
    <li> Oh yeah! Skeptical about those hard to pronounce ingredients? Wear this without worry.</li>
    <li> Used to use Gillette but wanted to try something new. Tried this deodorant because I wanted to find something that was more natural and didn&#x27;t have the junk most deodorants have in them. This stuff smells nice when you first put it on. It doesn&#x27;t last very long though and it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job... if you start sweating at all it smells rank. Switched to Dove and it lasts all day easily.</li>
    <li> I really liked this deodorant. The smell was good and it seemed to last longer than other natural brands I&#x27;ve tried like Toms. However, I had to let it go because it gave me a serious rash. I was really surprised since it is natural, but I do have very sensitive skin. As soon as I stopped wearing it the rash cleared almost immediately. So the quest continues for a natural deodorant that lasts and smells good.</li>
    <li> Best smelling deodorant I have found by far and it is relatively healthy to boot!!</li>
    <li> Tried this, as I was intrigued by the claim of a natural deodorant.  It caused itching for the entire day of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason for 2 stars is that its scent is pretty nice.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells really nice, but unfortunately the smell last for about 2 hours, then it wears off and you start to smell like a mixture of sweat and this deodorants scent, it&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
    <li> smells good and works for about a day</li>
    <li> It only covers the odor for a few hours.......max.  I am definitely disappointed. After reading all the great reviews I ordered 3 different Ones and tried them all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a massage therapist I can not allow myself to have underarm odor, but this product surely worried me a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I can not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an athletic person and the 1 1/2 at the gym simply overpowered this product in no time.</li>
    <li> Cannot believe how well this works! If you don&#x27;t mind a bit of a manly smelling deodorant, it&#x27;s the best non-toxic deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Keeps me dry and fresh and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought this was &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; but it is not.  In the ingredients it contains &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34;.  Do a simple search and you will see that &amp;#34;fragrances&amp;#34; can be a cover up for chemicals not good for the body.  I never used this product.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Almost $2 cheaper than buying at our local health store. This is my husband&#x27;s favorite natural deodorant. Smells great too!</li>
    <li> I suppose I&#x27;ve only tried two natural deodorants: Tom&#x27;s of Maine (several scents) and this one. After using Tom&#x27;s for about two years and never being completely satisfied with it (I could always smell my body odor at the end of the day if not by the late afternoon), I decided to search for something new and stumbled upon this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and it blows Tom&#x27;s out of the water! I love this scent and even at the end of a 13 hour workday I still smell great without a hint of body odor. I highly recommend for anyone thinking of switching from Tom&#x27;s...you won&#x27;t be disappointed! Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents too!</li>
    <li> Great piny smell and goes on without slimy residue. Very good.</li>
    <li> Tried axe, old spice, and degree. All made pits itch and had a chemical smell. This stuff is awsome, been using for 2 weeks with no itch or harsh odor</li>
    <li> I didnt like it. The scent was way too strong - it seemed like all it was was an attempt to mask odor via perfume. It didnt seem to work well with me either. I gave it a few tries.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t PERFECT in fighting odor, but it works good! and smells good too!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to use and he didn&#x27;t use it out of fear of it not working.  I really liked the smell and the natural deodorants kept making me break out in rashes so I tried it.  I liked it so much I ordered their baby powder scent.</li>
    <li> I gave up on deodorant because it would occasionally give me itchy armpits.  I went months without using anything, worrying the whole time that others would be aware of my body odor.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now with no itchiness.  It has a pleasant smell and seems to be a fine deodorant.</li>
    <li> Four stars only because under stress or workout hubs smells crunchy. I have been crunchy for a few years so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at him but when we are out, it isn&#x27;t cute. Lol. Smells great, have a back up for sweaty days though...</li>
    <li> Smells really good and doesn&#x27;t have weird chemicals</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me but smells good.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the other deodorants I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it is the best natural deodorant that I have used so far. It is white, but doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on my clothes like the other non natural deodorants that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
    <li> Useless deodrant, does not do the job at all, within 2-3 hours the deodrant under your arms will completely dissapear and the smell is VERY weak/faint.</li>
    <li> For a bigger man who sweats a lot and has tried many other alternative deodorants, this one finally came through!&lt;br /&gt;Could even keep one at work if needed?&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT.&lt;br /&gt;Forest scent: Old Spice-like.</li>
    <li> Alas, my search for a good natural deodorant continues. The reviews on this particular deodorant gave me hope, but those hopes were soon dashed; unfortunately the effectiveness dissipates after only about two hours, and I&#x27;m not a particularly &#x27;potent&#x27; guy. It picks up a star for a decent scent, and the fact that it&#x27;s not irritating to my skin, however it is very ineffective, and at the end of the day that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re looking for, right?</li>
    <li> Needed something different due to a breakout. Figure I would try this but was unsure of the scent. No complaints from me, I actually enjoy the smell and have had no adverse reactions from this which was the reason for purchase.  Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Keeps me smelling fresh with out chemicals.  My tee shirts are no longer stained - It works!</li>
    <li> Very good product. Distinct manly smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different natural deodorants, trying to avoid the ingredient aluminum.  This is one of the best smelling ones!  the price is also reasonable, I would highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product here. I usually buy Old Spice (Denali) scent, but it was starting to make my arm pits red and irritated. I love this deodorant because the scent is great hard to describe though. It lasts long enough for me and doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits. Big fan of this stuff.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells amazing but doesn&#x27;t work at all. The scent wears off after ten minutes and it gets incredibly liquid-y after applying. I don&#x27;t sweat that much, so considering it doesn&#x27;t work for me I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone else. Also, the actual stick itself doesn&#x27;t work properly. When you go to apply the deodorant and twist from the bottom to expose more of the bar, it gets pushed down and you end up scraping your skin with the sides of the container.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is much cheaper here than at my local grocery store. It smells delicious and has no bad chemicals! I will definitely purchase this again in the future. :)</li>
    <li> No one has complained that I smell, so I guess it works.  Fragrance is nice.  Seems like a good deodorant without all the chemicals mainstream products have</li>
    <li> My husband has tried all of these and this scent is his and my favorite.  It&#x27;s just very clean and fresh while still being manly.  It lasts all day for him &amp; we live where it gets up to 90 degrees by 9 am in the summer!</li>
    <li> This may be called &amp;#34;Forest&amp;#34;, but it could just as easily be called &amp;#34;Stank&amp;#34; because that&#x27;s exactly what it smells like. Nothing natural smelling about it. If you want something that smells like wood then try Yardley of London Citrus &amp; Wood deodorant. I was just trying to shake things up a bit by buying this one, but it smells bad. The Yardley actually smells like wood. The soap smells great too. Stay away from the cologne though.</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks.  Works very well and smells nice. I had used another natural brand that only seemed to work for a few hours under &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; conditions. This seems better than that.</li>
    <li> Gave it a try im happy with the results so far, long lasting no harsh chemicals&lt;br /&gt;and smells very fresh, for me is the best smell out of the Natural Grooming line.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Smells great and works great too!  Its better than tom&#x27;s, alba, beaver creek, and every other one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> Smells like Brut for Hipsters and doesn&#x27;t work. Boooooooo.</li>
    <li> Great product, and the deodorant itself last for a lot more applications than any brand I have tried in the past (conventional or natural.)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Degree antiperspirant for two decades and always liked the fact that I never smelled.  Never!  I developed sebaceous cysts on my lower arms and some on the chest probably when I was 12 years old or so.  I never thought that there might be a link, but I had a bump on my armpit a few months ago and eventually extracted what was like a hard, sticky stone.  &amp;#34;Perhaps antiperspirants aren&#x27;t so good,&amp;#34; I thought and I started searching for something that doesn&#x27;t stop you from sweating, but is also not as bad for you.  I tried Herban Cowboy Forest and initially I was pleasantly surprised.  Since I was so used to the smell of Degree, the pine-like smell of this deodorant was a welcome change and I catch a whiff every now and then.  I think for the first two to three weeks of use, I still had the carry over effects of using Degree and it clogging my pores to prevent me from sweating.  After that period, I started smelling some strong body odor.  I would say twelve hours is about as long as I go before I start smelling body odor.  I also notice that the pine scent isn&#x27;t very strong anymore.  Perhaps I became accustomed to the scent or maybe because this is a boutique product, it&#x27;s not mixed very well?  I  will probably look for something else when this runs out.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband, but I tried it because all the natural stuff for women didn&#x27;t work for me.  I loved it for myself as well.  It has a great smell for my husband, although I don&#x27;t love it for me.  I found that a combination of the crystal and young livings deodorant worked best for me.  He continues to use this and is very happy.  I don&#x27;t notice BO or sweat problems.</li>
    <li> Some reviewers say that there is a problem staining shirts.  I think this may be occuring while their body adjusts.  I did not see staining but seemed a little sweater at first.  Once I adjusted to it I have to say that it is a great product!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this deodorant I was hoping for a nice foresty scent. Its not that it smells bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like forest. It smells more like mint and medicine. It does do a good job at curbing odor, and when I read the ingredients there is some good stuff in there like Rosmary and Sage. Im still only 2 days into using it so my opinion may change over time.</li>
    <li> Smells okay just burnt the crap out of my pits.</li>
    <li> This is now the only deodorant my husband and I use. After a long journey of trying different natural deodorants, this is my favorite. It smells really nice (for men AND women), lasts a long time, is non-irritating and easy to apply. Please be aware that when you are transitioning from traditional antiperspirant to natural aluminum-free deodorants, you WILL go through a &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; period of toxins flushing out through the underarm skin. You will smell extra heinous for a week or two, and then the natural product will work much better. It is worth it.</li>
    <li> Smells good when applied but does not last long while working as a firefighter.</li>
    <li> smells good, my girlfriend likes it, only lasts a day or so, then my natural odor takes over..:)</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant. Smells great and lasts the day. It&#x27;s as simple as that. As long as they make it, I won&#x27;t stop buying it.</li>
    <li> I collect a lot of very high end cologne (Creed, Hermes, YSL), and I can safely say this particular scent from Herban Cowboy layers very well with some of the very best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creed&#x27;s &amp;#34;Spice and Wood&amp;#34; is one of my all time favorite colognes but it is very expensive. If I use half as much but layer it with this deodorant, it can make it last all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells at least as good as the $50/stick deodorants from the fancy fashion houses.</li>
    <li> The only stuff I&#x27;ve used for several years.  Good smell and covers odor well too!</li>
    <li> Great smell, but doesn&#x27;t stay long</li>
    <li> Love this product. I was using Tom&#x27;s of Maine, and found that it didn&#x27;t keep me dry during a full day! I just tried Herban Cowboy, and not only did the product keep me dry it has a light, refreshing scent that lasts 24 hours! I will definitely be purchasing this product again and I highly recommend it to those who are searching for a better, non-toxic product.</li>
    <li> This is the best non aluminum deodorant I&#x27;ve used. It smells real nice and is not crazy expensive at all.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors enjoying Nature. When I found Herban Cowboy FOREST deodorant, I had to try it.  This is the only Natural deodorant that I have found that works. I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I started using it because I didn&#x27;t want a deodorant that has to many chemicals. Lasts all day and a pleasant scent</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have ever used. It lasts and it works and it is amazing. I love the Forest scent. I bought the &amp;#34;Wild&amp;#34; version and didn&#x27;t like it as much -- though it works just as well as the Forest. Will be buying this for years.</li>
    <li> Very impressed with this stuff. I was curious, wanted to be healthier so I thought I would try it. Nice smell, works great. I am a runner and it works even then. We will see how it holds up in the summer heat.</li>
    <li> It smells great and it lasts!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  After a long day including a run or workout, the product still works great and no body odor.  He previously used right guard and wanted something more natural without aluminum.  This product works as good if not better than the standard deodorant with aluminum.  It has been a week and there are no complaints.  After a 30,000 step Fitbit day, the product performed amazing.  The scent is masculine but not overwhelming.  The deodorant does not leave any residue and goes on clear like a typical gel deodorant that he used to wear.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> has become my deodorant of choice.</li>
    <li> I bought the Herban Cowboy Forest. It was a gel instead of a stick like I thought and it&#x27;s not working for odor for me. I&#x27;m female but I&#x27;m looking for men&#x27;s because I like how they smell better, but this one reacts with me and makes my armpits smell worse somehow. Otherwise it smells nice and woodsy from the tube and it was a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  Not overwhelming in scent.  Smells really good.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this deodorant... But protection was okay.</li>
    <li> Great scent, no nasty chemicals. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I was searching for a vegan based deo without aluminum, triclosan and other harmful agents. But I found this one and it rocks</li>
    <li> This just doesn&#x27;t do much.  I don&#x27;t sweat a ton by any means but I find myself having to apply this several times a day and even then it&#x27;s just not great.  I&#x27;m not sure where the positive reviews are coming from.  It&#x27;s possible that this product works better than other natural products but when compared to Old Spice, it hardly works at all.</li>
    <li> I used Tom&#x27;s for a long while, but recently noticed it wasn&#x27;t as effective as it used to be, so I read various reviews to see what would work.  This looked like the best bet, and I was happy to see women used it too.  The product itself is fine - it does feel a little wet when you first put it on, even though it&#x27;s not, but that strange sensation passes after a minute or so.  It is very effective - put it on and forget it, with no risk of things going wrong later in the day.  What I didn&#x27;t like about it was the very masculine fresh scent.  It would be fine for a guy, but it was just way too much on me.  I discovered that they also make a version for women (&amp;#34;Blossom&amp;#34;) so I switched to that.</li>
    <li> I liked the smell but did not last all day.</li>
    <li> Amazing deodorant, smells wonderful! Everyone I&#x27;ve shown this to has enjoyed the scent, especially various women. Will be getting more! :)</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a better review for this product, but my package was left in the heat, and was melted when I opened it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every &amp;#34;non-irritating&amp;#34; deodorant I can track down.  They either light my armpits on fire or don&#x27;t work.  This is the first I&#x27;ve found that succeeds in all endeavors.  Really great product.</li>
    <li> Great, natural smelling fragrance.  Doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a soft fancy boy.  Doesn&#x27;t leave my underarms feeling sticky and gross.  My coworkers and training partners no longer complain of my overpowering man musk.  Most of them consider it a pleasant treat to find themselves stuck in my kesa gatames and arm triangles.  This will be my go to deodorant from now on.</li>
    <li> Tried it in winter and I smelled like I&#x27;d been seating my ass off in August by the time 5 o&#x27;clock rolled around. It might work better if I reapplied at some point, but that seems ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Normal deodorants cause me to get severe hives in my armpits, so I decided to try this. It works great, smells great and I don&#x27;t get anymore hives.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but doesn&#x27;t last very long. Wish it lasted longer throughout the day. :/</li>
    <li> I got a painful rash from this product that looked like two bruises under my armpits. I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life before... medication, food, etc. I only applied this product twice and after day one had peeling skin and minor redness under my armpits, and by day two it was like having a bad sunburn in my armpits that was painful any time I&#x27;d move my arms.  Horrible. Back to my Old Spice.  I am submitting a picture along with this review so you can see how bad it was, and this is just from two applications.  I&#x27;m not the only person who&#x27;s reported getting rash from this product, just read the other reviews.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether to recommend this or not. On the one hand, it does seem to keep sweat odors a bay. On the other hand, it smells like a dime-store cologne counter at xmas. It&#x27;s just a jumble of musky smells that strikes me as obnoxious as any chemical-based cologne, and it makes my nose run. It may be totally natural, but my body does not react as though it&#x27;s natural. So if you are chemically sensitive, or if you have a sensitive nose, you may need to steer clear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to return to mixing baking soda and coconut oil, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant! It smells a little manly, but if you like the smell of men&#x27;s deodorant or don&#x27;t mind smelling a little woodsy, it&#x27;s still a great deodorant for women. It&#x27;s super effective, and I don&#x27;t have to reapply deodorant during the day like I do with other natural deodorants. I will definitely be buying this deodorant or another scent by this company again. I am a fairly heavy sweater, but have only used this deodorant in the fall/winter months, so I am hoping I have the same level of protection when it gets warmer. I have faith that this is still a better deodorant than the others out there.</li>
    <li> I am a female who has been using the Forest scent for over a year now.  I use it as a natural choice for overnight.  I got hooked on the forest scent before I knew about the more feminine scents.  But this is just a fresh, good smell that works for men or ladies.  The smell itself does not last long, but the odor protection is long lasting.  Obviously if you sweat buckets this might not be a good choice.  But if you are looking for an effective natural choice, you have a desk job like most people, or you want some lighter overnight protection like me, then Herban Cowboy is a great choice.  Watch out for other brands claiming to be natural - look at the ingredients!!!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want a strongly scented deodorant, but this product barely has any scent at all.</li>
    <li> Works better than any of the other natural products I&#x27;ve tried. Smell is good, not too pungent or over the top.</li>
    <li> I tried to enter natural deodorants and it did not work, but this herban cowboy works excellent I used to use antiperspirant and have been trying for the past two weeks to find all-natural Deodorant that works? After several purchases of the other major brand natural deodorants I came across this one and it works super no need to go out and buy others this one works excellent!!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product.  It is very smooth and non drying.  The odor protection lasts a long time, and it has a nice fresh scent.  I will definitely be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Which isn&#x27;t bad I like how they don&#x27;t use aluminium so my memory for tests and all around studying have improved.</li>
    <li> A great natural deodarant! My fiancee loves this stuff. I normally make my own, but it was melting with the hot summer temperatures so I purchased this. Shipping was a little slow, but otherwise have been very pleased.</li>
    <li> Got this one for my 20 yr. daughter who likes the great natural outdoorsy scent. After trying many other natural deodorants, this one seems to work for her best on odor and sweating. No stained clothing, no white pits, no turning armpits dark either. I  plan to try this scent next, after really liking the Wild scent.</li>
    <li> Not only do I sweat a lot... but it smells.  This product masked the smell for about 5 hours (i work 12 hour shifts).  The all natural product I have found the best for me is Jungleman.</li>
    <li> Rash in the relevant area. I have to stop using and try another &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant. I do have the &amp;#34;Maximum Protection&amp;#34; version, so I will try that after any rash has disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone else experience this?</li>
    <li> My husband has had red arm pits that burn when he uses normal deodorant. Hes tried lots of natural ones front the store but they never keep him smelling good. Well, he love this one!! It smells so good and doesn&#x27;t burn his arm pits. He works in a potato processing plant where it&#x27;s super hot and he still smells good when he gets home!</li>
    <li> After trying many natural and aluminum-free deodorants, this brand seems to work well (my pits don&#x27;t stink when I get home from work), just NOT this scent.  The &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smell does not mask BO very well.  The Dusk scent is MUCH better.</li>
    <li> Great scent. Natural and masculine rather than sweet fake chemical smells. Great line.</li>
    <li> Great scent, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Smells good, does not last very long.  Keep the stick with you to reapply if you are out and about.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled worse using this product. I&#x27;m better off not wearing anything.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 2+ years. I have no complaints. Most days it works very well. I am moving, climbing, crawling, for 6+ hours each day inside and outside. On really warm days it may wear off sooner, but almost all products do under that type of stress. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve had no burning under my arms, no discomfort, no anything. The product does not stain your clothes. It also lasts longer than you think it would.  While the price point may deter some people, and while others still question some of the ingredients, my take on it is that this is better than what I used for 15 years prior -- better for my body and my mind. I&#x27;m happy with this product. I fully endorse the product and strongly suggest you try it, if you are on the fence about buying it. The scent does not stay overly strong throughout the day, but the product works. For most people, who may not labor greatly throughout the day, this product should work well. Given that, remember that we all are a bit different with how we respond to these products. I know some reviews say it doesn&#x27;t work or it was not comfortable -- I think that&#x27;s going to be a case by case basis, depending on a host of unique variables for each of us. If you want to try a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product than what is usually commercially available in grocery stores, give this a try. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> My new favorite deodorant with a pleasant feel and scent. It has not left a bad residue on my clothing, and supposedly refrains from harsh ingredients.It feels much better than the Tom&#x27;s brand I was using.</li>
    <li> Lasts all day about 85% of the time, and slightly irritates my sensitive skin. Baux by l&#x27;Occitane works better, but still irritates my skin, and costs $25 for a container that lasts only a month. This is an OK alternative, but I&#x27;ll be looking for something better.</li>
    <li> If you sweat a lot-- don&#x27;t get this. It seriously lasts an hour for both myself and my boyfriend. We smell like B.O. and pine needles. I&#x27;m pretty bummed because it got good reviews but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, and he&#x27;s very pleased with it. It works well and smells fresh and clean, plus it is very inexpensive. We&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of natural deodorants and all have failed after a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seems to be my favorite.  It has a bit of a &#x27;musk&#x27; smell which is not unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, I feel confidant that I won&#x27;t stink till the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can&#x27;t compete with regular deodorant; however, I feel better about using natural one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say, &#x27;Give it a try&#x27;.</li>
    <li> SO FAR IT SEEMS TO CONTROL ODOR TO A REASONABLE EXTENT.  NOT OVERPOWERING AND I AM NOT SURE HOW IT WILL WORK DURING THE HOT SUMMER MONTHS.</li>
    <li> Regular deodorants break me out from time to time, but I&#x27;ve been using this for months now &amp; haven&#x27;t had a problem. It lasts all day &amp; I work 10hr days in a mechanic shop.</li>
    <li> I gave this a shot.  I knew it was not antiperspirant but figured why not give it a try anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use degree cool comfort and never have any smell all day.  I used this stuff a few times and by the time i got home from work (~8hr desk job) I could smell BO on me.  I&#x27;m not really a stinky type of guy either, and yes i did shower before applying just like i would every other morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont buy it!</li>
    <li> Great smell, great ingredients, good value! My husband really enjoys the scent and it lasts and works for him. He&#x27;s a Journeyman Lineman so I&#x27;d say he puts it to the test in all weather and it works great!!</li>
    <li> My husband has issues with deodorant. With just about every conventional deodorant on the market, he&#x27;s left with unpleasant irritation under his arms. (It sort of looks like eczema but isn&#x27;t. Its red, patchy, and rather scaly.) It would get pretty bad and he&#x27;d have to go days without using deodorant until it cleared up, only to use it for a little while and have it come back. In response, we started going through a million &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants to see what would work for him. Well, the irritation would go away but none actually kept the stink away. He&#x27;s an auto-worker and spends twelve hours a day in a factory - working deodorant is sort of a necessity. We tried a salt crystal deodorant, and that worked beautiful but he finds it inconvenient to have to wet the crystal before applying. On a whim, I bought some Herban Cowboy. We have a winner! It works wonderfully - its both effective and it hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation at all. He swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as well, in a different scent (this scent actually gives me a headache! I have the nose of a bloodhound, however, and am very scent-sensitive.) My chemistry is a bit different than my husband&#x27;s and its not as effective for me as it is for him, so in the interest of conscience, I had to deduct one star. I will note that I am a very difficult case and I have yet to find anything that I am 100% happy with, natural or conventional. Despite that fact, Herban Cowboy pretty much beats them all.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product. A deodorant without all the chemicals. It smells great, didn&#x27;t cause any irritation, but only lasts a couple hours. Unfortunately I can only use it when I am able to reapply once or twice a day. Just not too convenient. Maybe it will work better for others than it did for me.</li>
    <li> For whatever reason, this one seems to lose its scent more quickly that the other deodorants i&#x27;ve used from this company</li>
    <li> I routinely use two products. One low end, aluminum-based from Gilette, and the other, aluminum free from MenScience Androceuticals. Both of these work well. Unfortunately, this Herban Cowboy did not work at all for my body chemistry. The fragrance was fine, but the performance was not.</li>
    <li> Smells great, goes on nicely.. have zero complaints from me about this deodorant. Works better than my previous deodorant. A+</li>
    <li> I like this product as it does the job well and it keeps me from smelling. It&#x27;s a bit pricey and for that price I would expect the product to last longer. One staff off for that.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t keep BO away. smells good but half way through the day I smell a mix of deodorant and BO</li>
    <li> Smells great, but just is a long way from the working as well as regular deodorant.</li>
    <li> How do you rate a fabulous product 2 stars? When you cant use it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, absolutely. Chemical free, absolutely. Cheaply designed bottle, absolutely. The spinning dial on the bottom has stripped through the stick. If I want to use it, I have to tip it upside down, let the whole stick slide out, grab it with my hands, apply it, then put it back in the container and wash up my hands. Sigh, after only 10 or so uses too! Not kidding. Looking into the bottle, they used a really poor and cheap quality design, Im surprised more of these don&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another star was deducted for the duration of the odor protection. Maximum protection? I think not... The more chemical laden products last longer, even all day! (yes, most likely due to chemicals, I get it, but that is what we are all used to, no? 12hr-ish protection) This one? Not so much. Too bad, I like their shave cream a heckuva lot! And I try to support these natural, small companies. Will not be recommending the product though:(</li>
    <li> when I see all this reviews , directly I  bought 2 of this Deodorant , but I regretted , because it didn&#x27;t stop perspiration , and it Reduce the smell about 40% only</li>
    <li> Personally; while I am using this deodorant, I am feel the difference. I no longer get the irritation on my armpits, that I used to get from the chemical deodorants. Also the HERBAN COWBOY is a long lasting scent. Which is really helpful, considering that I travel via the subway system quite often. This is very practical, for anyone trying to convert to a healthier lifestyle regimen. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well, but it smells like cheap old man cologne. People have compared this to Tom&#x27;s, but the scent is far more unnatural smelling.</li>
    <li> No problems, works good and long (all day+), fragrance is richer than I was used to at first, but after using up one stick I&#x27;m finding it is just right. I&#x27;m upping my rating from 4 to 5 stars one stick into no longer having to carry a stick of Tom&#x27;s in my laptop bag because it didn&#x27;t do the trick to begin with -  Herban Cowboy Forest does the trick!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I bought it mainly because of it is an aluminium free product. However it is the one product that really has managed to keep me feeling fresh and does a fantastic job in a warm climate. I really recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good smelling and works.</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this deodorant, but the scent or its effectiveness does not last. After about 2 hours it wears off. If they can up its effectiveness, I will buy again</li>
    <li> Best smelling Herban Cowboy deoderant for men - smells of pine. Long lasting.</li>
    <li> Works really well, and the scent is delightful!  Good all day for light activity, but you&#x27;ll need to reapply if you get super sweaty.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so strong of cheap artificial fragrance that I had to give it to my friend. I put it on and kept getting whiffs of it all day. He likes the smell of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell reminds me of Axe. If you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, avoid this.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t keep my pits from smelling on a normal day any longer than if I weren&#x27;t wearing deodorant. It smells great for a few hours though, that is, until you associate it with your B.O.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but you ultimately end up sweating it off in short order (let&#x27;s say 20-30 minutes) and you end up smelling worst than you had prior to putting it on. Something in the formulation seems to intensify the smell of your sweat, and so I only use this when I&#x27;m planning on staying home all day.</li>
    <li> This used to be my favorite natural deodorant but I&#x27;m changing my review from five stars. The last few shipments of this product have made me break out every time I use it. I have switched to another product.</li>
    <li> I usually use Old Spice Sport which tends to last a full day. But I wanted to go a more natural route and checked out Amazon for for highly-rated more natural deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some Herban Cowboy Forest Deoderant. It smells pretty good but the smell is somewhat faint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I applied the product to my underarms it felt like the typical deodorant as far as application goes. I applied the product liberally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a pretty lazy day around the house - meaning I didn&#x27;t do a lot of physical work. Yet only a few hours later when I checked (sniffed) my underarms it didn&#x27;t smell fresh - at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this product to work and it really doesn&#x27;t. I like the smell and that it&#x27;s healthy ingredients, which is why it gets two stars.</li>
    <li> I get in grown hairs always and I took on this to help . My ingrown hairs have dramaticlyrics gone down since using this product I tossed out my commercial brand</li>
    <li> Works VERY well and I sweat easily. The scent is also awesome for me (a guy) and I haven&#x27;t got sick of it in 3 years now. I use this scent in the summer and their Dusk one in the fall/winter. I&#x27;ve tried about 4 other brands from my local Whole foods and all of them let some odor through, some quite a bit. I&#x27;ve found both scents I mentioned of this to not let anything through not even after working out. Love the stuff.</li>
    <li> Does not work at all. This is unbelievably terrible, I smell better with my natural B.O. I recommend Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
    <li> The odor was too strong and too musky for me. It worked as a deodorant, but so does the one I was using before (degree), and I preferred that fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that it does not contain any harsh chemicals like most other deodorants. No aluminum was a big factor for me. Me and my wife love the smell of this deodorant. I will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> It works, is healthy, and my wife likes the smell. A+ Like most natural deodorants you may need to apply more than once a day if you&#x27;re working out or it&#x27;s hot.</li>
    <li> Great product! It smells like... pine. A pine forest. I like it and will buy again! Bit of a high price, though...</li>
    <li> In a quest for that better, safer deodorant, I have to say this is anything but the pits.  In fact, it&#x27;s FIRST PLACE so far after a couple years of trying several highly rated brands and scents that aren&#x27;t full of nasty materials with safety concerns.  This one has a very pleasant outdoorsy, woodland fragrance that should appeal to anyone that gets turned off by sweet or overbearing. I disqualify those that tend to take over odor by masking it.  Here we have a product with ingredients that really prevent a break-out of stench.  Very impressive even under tough conditions.  Also lasts the whole day, since I&#x27;m never thinking about it.  The ingredients are also relatively safe -- and apparently getting safer. This is my first set of criteria. The latest version did change a bit with the manufacturer making it clear there were tweaks. This review is on the previous recipe which is the benchmark from which I made my first purchase.  The jury is out and testing will continue on the latest, even safer version, when I make the switch. If the news on performance is bad, I&#x27;ll be sure to update the review.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works and it smells amazing.  I want to try more scented deodorants from this brand now.  Way better than any other natural deodorant brand I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have tried toms and it just didn&#x27;t last after three hours. I have used this one for two days now and it last a full ten plus hours at work.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it, but find it does little to cover any body odor after just a couple hours of regular day to day moving around.</li>
    <li> Purchased because it&#x27;s aluminum-free.  Works well, nice scent.</li>
    <li> I just recently started trying Herban Cowboy products and I LOVE THEM! They all smell really nice without being overpowering or repulsive to others (even people with scent sensitivities).&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Axe and Old Spice for a very long time but I had bad reactions to many of their products. Often times my arm pits would feel like they were on fire. However, this has not been the case with the Forest Deodorant by Herban Cowboy. I can put on how ever much I want without fear of having any kind of bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is much different from &amp;#34;conventional&amp;#34; deodorants (like axe or old spice) but it&#x27;s very nice and now I want to try out their other deodorants as well. Over all, I am happy with this product and will be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve rarely used deodorants that weren&#x27;t also anti-antiperspirants. Perhaps some \\&quot;Tom&#x27;s\\&quot; at some time but I was never happy with them. This works far better than any hypo-allergenic that I&#x27;ve used. Has a great scent but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Does keep me odor free for a long time.</li>
    <li> This has lasted me six months!  It works perfect and smells so good.  It is my new everyday deodorant and I will be reordering.  Cheaper than Whole Foods, too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of natural deodorants and this one is hands down the best. I don&#x27;t stink! Even when I work out. Crazy! Love the smell, wish my whole house smelled that good. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Just awesome. I feel healthy... a very good feeling to know what I am protecting my body from harmful things. And for my strong oder, it really covers it very well! On hot summer days after sweating for 6 hours, I will have to re-apply or take a fresh shower. In earlier reviews, there was not a detox period from when Ive stopped using the toxic OTC deodorants. This worked instantly.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not anything different than what you are use to. It&#x27;s nice using a product that is different than the rest.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s smells fantastic, and it does the job but not that long! It works for the first couple of hours of casual activity (office or school), but then it wears off. And I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it for working out. As far as reapplying, it seems to make any bad smell even worse.</li>
    <li> The smell of this deodorant is fine, nothing special. But it does not work at all. By noon it was completely ineffective.</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic and is a nice complement to Jack Black body wash. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the protection just doesn&#x27;t quite make it through the entire day for me. And if I go to the gym after work? Forget it. It is totally overpowered. If they can revise the formula to address this, it will be the perfect deodorant.</li>
    <li> Needs a better smell.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last. In a few hours you have no protection. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Tom&#x27;s Woodspice works much better in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Two caveats: I&#x27;m a sweaty male and I shower at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a quest to go more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; I have been searching for a good natural deodorant. This one was highly rated so I gave it a go. I&#x27;m not sure if I will order it again. For me personally the protection wears off at about 3pm and I start to get whiffs of pits when I move around. I believe I showered in the morning to remove the bacteria that has gathered there overnight the protection would last longer? I stated using a crystal deodorant at night for lite protection until the morning and that seems to help.  More than the smell issue I don&#x27;t really like the feeling of it on my armpits. It feels &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; under my arms. Like a layer of bees wax. The stick itself is a solid gel hybrid... I&#x27;m not really sure what it is. It&#x27;s not as liquidy as a gel but its wet and sticky. I much prefer the tactile feeling of a more powdery solid or the feeling of nothing like with the crystal deodorants. The search continues!</li>
    <li> I would like this if it didn&#x27;t melt on your underarms and cause them to be all wet, therefor causing your shirt to look like you&#x27;ve been sweating. I tried to like it but I just cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The watery feeling, and look starts a few minutes after putting it on. You can actually see it melting also. You will need a towel if you use this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried numbers of natural deodorants including Toms, all of which had the same effect. Each of them smelled nice for 2 hours and then actually accentuated the smell of BO. All were terrible waste of money and time. This product smells great and works all day the real test is summer and I went on a camping trip last weekend in the heat all day and night and never had to reapply. Love it, thank you for figuring it out. I am tired of having only poisonous options to keep clean,</li>
    <li> I have used this deodorant for around 6 months after switching from old spice deodorant that use to cause irritation. I switched to an all natural product and I have not have an irritation since. The smell is very pleasant, however after a long day and a good gym workout you will need to reapply. Overall its a very nice product.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but it didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s getting 2 stars because I like the idea of this, and the smell, but the deodorant itself only lasted for a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> Believe me, I wanted this to work because my Bionsen pump spray has begun to irritate and my pits are picky about deodorant in that 99% of aluminum-free deodorants just do nothing to deter the funk. (If you&#x27;re in the market, Bionsen pump spray works really well. The roll-on is useless.)  Herban Cowboy smells great, it&#x27;s true, but for me it has no effect whatsoever on sweaty smells. And it goes from two stars to one because the stick has a kind of slimy, sticky texture which doesn&#x27;t &#x27;dry&#x27; or get less sticky after application. So that&#x27;s half a star for the scent and half a star for the amusing name.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells nice, and works well. No rashes on my armpits or forehead (my wife tried it, then put me in a headlock until I screamed mercy). No visible marks on my clothes, either.&lt;br /&gt;-David</li>
    <li> Delivered on time.  Not sure if heat-damaged or what, but the deodorant itself did not sit well in its casing.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like it and it works well. On days where I&#x27;m going to be coming home late, out in the sun, working out, or otherwise sweating for a longer period than normal I wear more traditional deodorant. On all other days though this stuff works perfectly fine and I like not slathering my underarms with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t very strong so if you&#x27;re expecting &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scent you get with deoderants then you&#x27;ll probably be disappointed.</li>
    <li> this lasts all day for my boyfriend, who is a smelly, rancid man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention he has extremely hairy pits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, he comes home smelling like a million dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I like this. yes.</li>
    <li> Very good and smells good too.</li>
    <li> This deodorant is great due to its ingredient list being more natural, but it does a terrible job.  The feel is like sticky goo on your underarms.  The smell is very manly, but lasts for a short couple of hours.  Then, as you day progresses and the deodorant wears off even more, the scent actually makes your B.O. Smell worse.  That&#x27;s right, the forest scent intensifies the B.O.!  Terrible protection from smelling bad.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this deodorant. On one hand, I&#x27;m happy that products like this one exist; everything&#x27;s so full of chemical garbage nowadays that it&#x27;s just nice to find companies that still prioritize consumer health and needs over profits. But on the other hand, this one just doesn&#x27;t work all that well for me at all. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m any stinkier or sweatier than the next guy but it only lasts me like 2-3 hours. Smells nice while it lasts, though; woodsy.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be pine scent, and it kind of has a resemblance to pine, but for me, the scent was unpleasant.</li>
    <li> Smells good when you put it on and two hours later it is like you have nothing on.</li>
    <li> Really does smell like nature and lasts throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Wonderful smell, would buy if offered in body spray, but this does not offer odor protection and needs to be reapplied every 3 or so hours, the addition of baking soda would make this product a 5 star.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m new to the organic deodorant thing but this seems to work decent as long as I scrub my arm pits every day.  Sometimes I still get stinky in the gym but I don&#x27;t ever worry about it when I&#x27;m not working out.  It smells good and is definitely manly.  I&#x27;m going to try a few other brands but I can make this work if nothing else.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love it but it just didn&#x27;t cut the mustard. Good scent but hot days in the south make it not an option for a sweaty guy.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s healthier than the aluminum containing products and that&#x27;s great. however, i find that if i do a lot of physical activity during the day, my pits smell pretty bad, and this does not happen with aluminum products. yet, one can always reapply this product, which has a pleasant sage/parsley kind of smell, and that scent covers the sweat smell well. overall recommended as a healthier alternative.</li>
    <li> Effective yet I like the Dusk scent much more</li>
    <li> While advertised as a deodorant, it does provide some degree or sweat control.  I had used Degree fro years with no problem; I got a promotional package of Mitchum Gel which within a week caused severe rash, then lymph node infection.  IT turns out that Mitchum had 3x the amount of the aluminum compound of Degree.  After a couple weeks of antibiotics, special topical cream treatment and special soap, the rash and infection went away, but I was determined to not have a reoccurrence.  Commercial deodorants from Gillete and Old Spice failed miserably. I tried Herban Cowboy (what a silly name) on the recommendation of a friend, and was surprised to find it was pretty effective. At the end of a long day including physical exercise, it might start to ail, but then again Degree and anything else I used also started to fail. I have had no reaction or issues, the scent is very mild, and it has some degree of sweat prevention.  Before I use this, I swab my pits with witch hazel; also, I groom the hair to 1.2&amp;#34; which helps. Overall, a great product I intend to stick with.</li>
    <li> Despite the title I&#x27;m giving this deo five stars, because although yes it does need renewed throughout the day (I usually get by with two applications but if I&#x27;m headed to lift or do a big workout I&#x27;ll throw on one more coat), it smells great, goes on easily (some of the natural deodorants don&#x27;t), and doesn&#x27;t have parabens or aluminum or any of the other things we&#x27;re supposed to avoid.  The smell is very nice - herbaceous but not medicinal.  I&#x27;m a girl and I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too masculine for me, but I&#x27;ve never been one of those girls that wears &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;cotton candy&amp;#34; type scents to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, eight bucks a pop is pricey, but it works and it means I don&#x27;t have to screw around with coconut oil in a tube trying to get the proportions right so if you&#x27;re like me and you just want a deodorant that works, I&#x27;d recommend this stuff.</li>
    <li> I worked for the second largest supplement company in the US with  30,000+ products distributed, I have tried all forms of natural deodorant available, the only one that works is Aubrey, this is a scam just like all the others, im not a stinky person, I dont eat onions or garlic, I have been vegetarian for many years, this isnt any better then not using it at all</li>
    <li> Work needs me to stay smelling as pleasantly as possible while keeping it as neutral as possible and this does a great job of it; better than expected of a natural product. Feels good, works well and smells like a natural, &amp;#34;Forest&amp;#34; deodorant by any major brand but still pleasant. Price is worth the health. Very happy repeat customer. Mountain is great too, good for going out.</li>
    <li> Nice pine-forest scent lasted most of the day.  Sometimes needed reapplication late afternoon.  Left raised red welts on my underarms.  Had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> Pleasantly very surprised. Was about to give up trying the natural stuff and then this. It works, amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> smells good, great name, not ingredient heavy, made in usa!</li>
    <li> This scent is awesome.</li>
    <li> Our pits are portals to our bods. We can&#x27;t be rubbing-on a chemistry set every night and day. And we want to smell good. Herban Cowboy Forest fills the bill on both counts. This is very rare in my experience. (The name forces a pun, I think, but that&#x27;s easy to overlook.) I recommend this product for hombres.</li>
    <li> smells good and works well</li>
    <li> This is really a great smelling product. I haven&#x27;t smelled any other deodorant that smells like this, but that isn&#x27;t a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great that it&#x27;s natural. Definitely the best scent of Herban Cowboy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a 10+ year Old Spice user who loved the Old Spice nature line (Fiji, Matterhorn, etc). Last week after tossing out yet another white t-shirt because of armpit stains I decided enough was enough. I bounced around Amazon reading reviews when I settled on this particular product, it arrived a few days ago and I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s important to set expectations with this product, it&#x27;s not like old spice. It doesn&#x27;t completely mask my scent like old spice did. Instead, it blends with my natural scent like milk into a morning espresso... beautifully.  I wake up at 5:30am and apply it after a warm shower. From 6am to about 11am I smell plain ol&#x27; good. Shortly after 11am my pheromone supplemented man musk starts to gently fuse with this deodorant and in doing so takes on an entirely new and unique smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell like \\&quot;product\\&quot; to me, it smells fresh and full of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been told several times I have a good musk and this takes my man musk to a whole new level. Instead of pummeling your nose with chemicals blocking the smell it blends together in what can only be described as a symphony of spice.  I&#x27;ve never loved a \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; product more and I can&#x27;t keep my nose out of my own pits. I&#x27;ve even demanded people smell my armpits.</li>
    <li> Finally--a natural deodorant that I can get behind and really works! After using non natural antiperspirants and deodorants for most of my life and recently developing a swollen lymph node in my armpit after switching to a clinical grade dove antiperspirant, I&#x27;ve come to realize that much of the ingredients in all the popular deodorants and antiperspirants contain ingredients that are potentially harmful to your body. In my case, it&#x27;s effected my lymphatic system. So as you can imagine, I&#x27;ve had to discontinue using them. I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and they are decent, but still contain things that I&#x27;m not comfortable absorbing into my body and I have to re-apply it frequently due to odor returning after a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the case with Herban Cowboy. I was skeptical at first, but it truly does work and lasts a good 8 hours for me. I was worried that it might loose it&#x27;s effectiveness after a few hours and that my coworkers or friends would catch a whiff of me, but that hasn&#x27;t happened yet. And it even holds up when I&#x27;m working out or drumming in my rather hot garage. Scent wise, it&#x27;s okay. It&#x27;s not overbearing, or dull and I think it&#x27;s something that the ladies and gents can both use. I myself, am a female if that helps.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but definitely not as effective as the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; types of deodorant.</li>
    <li> Prompt shipping, and great product!</li>
    <li> I was very happy receiving this deodorant and knowing it&#x27;s paraben-free. Smells really fresh and masculine. Only problem is that it does not last long at all. I find myself having to reapply it several times a day just to keep the stench at bay.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Works better than any other deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It smells good, but doesn&#x27;t keep me smelling good. I was hoping if I bought a stronger smell it would help, but it doesn&#x27;t. I have to apply it two or three times a day. I do not recommend if you have Graves&#x27; disease and sweat a lot.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best deodorant I have ever used. I was an avid Axe user and recently did a carrott juice cleanse and started eating non GMO foods and doing a Body Beast as well as P90X3. I will say it last all day unless you workout then you will need to reapply,as you do with normal deoderant too. This has a nice spell a very pine Forest smell in a non old man old spice way. I would recommend this product to anyone active and wanting to get aluminum out of there daily deodorant applications. I have tried all the different kinds from a herban cowboy this is the best by far,enjoy and buy 6 at a time that&#x27;s what I do so I&#x27;m good for about 5 to 6 months as you can not find it in big chain stores any where.</li>
    <li> love the smell. effective for me but maybe weak for some. vegan, alcohol free. they pay attention to the ingredients</li>
    <li> I was so hopeful for this product, but when I actually switched to it, things started out badly. Within two days, I developed a bad rash with bumps popping up under my arms. I decided that my body was just getting used to it, and I kept going with it. The rash never went away fully in the week that I tried this deodorant, but it got manageable. The smell when I put it on was ok at the beginning of the week, but by the end of the work day (desk job), I smelled terrible. As the week progressed, the smell started making me feel a bit nauseous, so I quit using this deodorant. I switched back to my old stuff (Old Spice), and it took two days before the residual smell went away. I smelled so much worse after a couple days wearing this one...just avoid.</li>
    <li> No irritation and it actually lasts all day, unlike other natural deodorants.</li>
    <li> Love the scent and keeps me smelling good all day</li>
    <li> Has a very strong scent. I started rashing immediately after the second time using it. But they were very nice and reimbursed me on the product. Great customer service.</li>
    <li> 2.5 stars, should have read the reviews better.  Literally only lasts 3-4 hours and then it&#x27;s like there is nothing on.  If you only need it to last a few hours, works great.  Anything more, avoid.</li>
    <li> When I saw &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; I ignorantly assumed this was a product in the line of other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants containing no synthetic petro chemicals, or other harmful ingredients - aluminum and parabens.  I was wrong to not read the label, and they are wrong to name the product natural. Don&#x27;t judge a deodorant by it name, don&#x27;t buy this if you want a health conscious product.</li>
    <li> One of the best natural deodorants I have used.</li>
    <li> Smells as manly as it gets while helping to mask your own manly stench.  Doesn&#x27;t last as long as regular deoderant but if you are looking at this it is most likely because you want to avoid all the chemicals, like me.  I haven&#x27;t found another that works as well as this.  I spend hours in the gym training MMA and my training partners have never complained about my smell...so either it works, or they&#x27;re too scared to tell me otherwise!</li>
    <li> Smells okay but does not really serve its purpose. I dont really sweat that bad and i could smell myself by the end of the work day</li>
    <li> This is probably the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells fantastic and lasts long considering it&#x27;s just a deodorant. I&#x27;d been a Toms guy for many years but I&#x27;ll be using this from now on!</li>
    <li> Works great for my boyfriend!! All natural and smells great!</li>
    <li> All I use, I read some reviews that people do not like. I think you body clicks with some deodorants. This is my favorite one and im super picky</li>
    <li> After researching deodorants here on Amazon.com for some time, this is the one that I finally ended up purchasing to replace my prior \\&quot;Old Spice High Endurance Fresh Scent Men&#x27;s Deodorant\\&quot; which as a blue stick had the annoying property of permanently staining my white undershirts blue (see my review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this white deodorant stick (low to no risk of staining!) have a refreshingly clean, long-lasting scent that keeps working throughout the day, but it is also aluminum-free for all those individuals who may want to intentionally avoid aluminum-containing products in light of the potential connection that long-term use of such products has to developing Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, if you want to smell good, feel fresh, avoid potentially noxious chemicals and keep your noggin as sharp as a tack during the natural aging process, then this Herban Cowboy Forest Deodorant Maximum Protection is certainly a product well worth considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this same top-quality deodorant is also available in other scents; just check the various listing here on Amazon.com for more information to find a more appealing scent if \\&quot;Forest\\&quot; just doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great. The scent is very woodsy. Something more like a bundle of herbs, it&#x27;s not musky at all, very crisp. It&#x27;s also not sticky at all and rolls on great. No white residue on armpits either. My only problem with it is the actual &amp;#34;deodorant&amp;#34; part was loose so it rocked back and forth while handling it. I might have just been unlucky though. Will buy again and try the other flavors.</li>
    <li> Very manly scent, nice price.</li>
    <li> I was extra stinky within about 3 hours. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with stink using any standard deodorant. Sorry guys this one doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for me.</li>
    <li> Summary: this deodorant is superior to both natural and chemical deodorants. I highly recommend you try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Situation: I originally purchased this deodorant with doubts. I hadn&#x27;t found an effective natural deodorant and most of the mainstream chemical deodorants weren&#x27;t working for me either (I have not used antiperspirant so I can&#x27;t comment on those). It felt like the deodorants were masking instead of protecting. It was stressful to worry if my deodorant was going to work today or not, and I was having to reapply throughout the day. Since I wasn&#x27;t having good results with either natural or chemical deodorants I decided to looked up top rated deodorants on amazon starting with natural ones. I&#x27;ve had amazing results with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deodorant details:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for about a month and it is fantastic. I apply daily out of routine, but I think it would easily work for more than 24hrs.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is piney (think Christmas tree) and is strong at first until it sinks into your skin. My girlfriend loves the scent and wanted one for herself so I think this scent can definitely work for women. I was worried about liquidity issues after reading other reviews but so far I have had none.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally this product is 100% vegan and 100% US made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ingredients were different than the ones in the amazon provided picture. I listed them below.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Propanediol, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Aqua, Sodium Stearate, Glycerin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Oryza Sativa (Rice) Starch Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Extract, Carum Petroselinum (Parsely) Extract, Salvia Officinalis (Sage) Leaf Extract, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Mineral Salts, Fragrance.</li>
    <li> Gives me a rash if I use it every day. It&#x27;s effective for 3 to 4 hours but then again, I sweat a lot more then the average guy.</li>
    <li> I would use it before bed, would barely last the 7 hours or so I slept. I did like the smell, and it washes away easily.</li>
    <li> Does not last long. Smells nice. Get a Crystal instead.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and foresty, but a bit too strong. That artificial &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; at the end of the list could have been dispensed with and I&#x27;d be happier. But this works great for deodorizing.&lt;br /&gt;No B.O. has gotten past this over the course of a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish those &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; crystal or mineral D.O.&#x27;s worked, but the ones I&#x27;ve tried have been woefully inadequate.</li>
    <li> Smell goes away within a couple hours, very sticky!</li>
    <li> IF you have chemical sensitivities, do NOT use this. The smell is overpowering, and NOT pleasant. I&#x27;m sure it works, but it gave me a migraine and severe brain fog, I suspect because of the &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34;, which means &amp;#34;chemical sh*tstorm&amp;#34;. NOT natural AT ALL.</li>
    <li> Smells great, but does not work at all for me as far as deodorizing.</li>
    <li> This scent is nice for those who want to capture an outdoor scent. There&#x27;s a clear presence of citrus in it however, which personally puts me off a bit. Definitely the better of the male scents, though I still prefer Dusk over this.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Doesn&#x27;t do much for wetness, but I&#x27;m okay with that.</li>
    <li> Best deo ever.  This is the best scent from urban cowboys too</li>
    <li> Smells good, feels good.</li>
    <li> Disappointing marketing gimmick on this product - at a glance, you get the feeling of all-natural, no harmful ingredients. By this, I understand no triclosan, and no aluminum derivatives. A quick inspection of the Herban Cowboy website confirmed that &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; is among the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alas, according to what is listed on the container, the thing contains alum (the rock your grandfather used after shaving; full name is potassium aluminum sulfate). Therefore, despite the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; hype, and the &amp;#34;no aluminum&amp;#34; advertising, this is simply another goo with some (maybe less) chemicals. I&#x27;ll avoid next time and I wished  I knew the ingredients before I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, when left for a prolonged period of time, the stick shrinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, regarding its deodorizing power, I found it modest and short-lasting. In comparison, simple coconut oil, Tom&#x27;s natural deodorant (the one completely natural), vodka sprayed underarms all have longer lasting effects.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my hubby when he wanted to switch to a more natural deoderant and he loves it! Smells great!</li>
    <li> First off, I want to say that I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am a hairy dude and by the end of the day I smell bad. Despite spending most of my day in an office, this deodorant just wasn&#x27;t able to stop the stank.</li>
    <li> My go-to deodorant for the past eight years has been Earth Science&#x27;s Liken deodorant. My local co-op seems to have stopped carrying it so I randomly picked this one up, made sure I liked the smell and took a chance. And I am so glad I did. This is by far the best (and best smelling) deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. I seriously love it so much (obviously, as I&#x27;m taking the time to write this review.).  This is actually probably weird, but whenever I randomly get a whiff of it throughout my day I just get psyched that I smell so d*mn good. So glad I found this!</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Lasts about 8-12 hours for me and eliminates the aluminium that I had been putting on myself from antiperspirants.  No reason to put chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce on your body everyday when the natural stuff works just as well.</li>
    <li> Works great Smells good</li>
    <li> Smells good to me, I have to reapply a couple times a day if im out and about and its hot but its not that big of an issue to me.</li>
    <li> Not only do I love this scent, it&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to find in stores. They have all the weaker/inferior scents, but this one is always missing from the shelfs/inventory. I used to faint from my own stench, but now this mixed with that familiar odor makes me irresistable to my wife. She&#x27;ll even sniff my clothes when I&#x27;m not home. The price here is also much better than at Whole Foods. Definitely only buying it here from now on.</li>
    <li> It is tough to find a good natural deodorant. So, I am basing this rating on comparisons to other natural deodorants, not &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; deodorants. I&#x27;m doing this because there just isn&#x27;t a comparison between natural brands and other brands. Natural brands just don&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with that said, Herban Cowboy is my favorite. I&#x27;ve found that it requires less applications Han other natural deodorants. It also smells much better. I&#x27;ve found other natural deodorants tend to smell like body odor mixed with natural scents... It&#x27;s just weird. Herban Cowboy does not do this. It retains a good scent, so long as you reapply often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I do like this brand, I no longer wear any deodorants. Although, I do keep a stick of this in my closet just in case.</li>
    <li> Nice product. Fast shipping.AAAA++++</li>
    <li> Great. The deodorant smells good. Much better than using deodorants that have chemicals in them that do who knows what to the body.</li>
    <li> Have used many different natural deodorants and this is one of my favorites! Great smell and it actually works!!</li>
    <li> I was recently persuaded by my wife to trade in my mass market deodorant for a more natural alternative  I work in a busy restaurant and I&#x27;m on my feet all day. This means I sweat, and I cant afford to be smelly in front of my guests. So far the Forest scent has lived up to my demands. I wont say it is as effective as a chemical laden antiperspirant, but I have ended the few evenings I have used it still smelling pretty good. The Forest scent is reasonably manly and woodsy. By far the best natural deodorant I have tried.</li>
    <li> This stuff really WORKS! No more half day old Italian hoagie smellin pits for me! Happy Cowboy here...</li>
    <li> The original scent is almost borderline musty to begin with. 1 hour of any sweaty labor and it just turns to funk. If you&#x27;re a bearded guy in flannel this might be for you.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding a good, natural deodorant that works well for my husband. We&#x27;ve tried those crystal-stone things, Jason, I can&#x27;t really remember all of the brands but none worked well enough. I read so many reviews on a bunch of different brands and decided to get him this one. He&#x27;s been using it for about 2 weeks now and so far, so good! It smells good, it has a more natural, woodsy, essential oil kind of smell; not like cologne. No more funky pits, he still smells like the deodorant after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s winter here in Cleveland and my husband has an office job. I&#x27;ll update this review in August and see if it holds up to the 5 stars....</li>
    <li> The hubster likes it and won&#x27;t go back to the other store bought deodorant he used to buy.  I&#x27;m happy that it doesn&#x27;t contain questionable chemicals.</li>
    <li> Read the horrors of aluminum in deodorant one night, and about 3 hours later after realizing I have been living a lie and possibly might give myself some health issues later on in life, I found this stuff.  I previously bought some other granola&#x27;ish deodorant and it lasted only a few hours, so that&#x27;s now the overnight deodorant.  This stuff is a bit stronger, but still not the best.  Lasts well in the Arizona summer, allows me to most of the time not stink by the time I am done working 9 hours and doing a 1.3 hour gym session.  Still not as powerful as the stuff you find at Target, but at least I am saving my health with this stuff.  Not as cheap as I would like, but good enough for now.  Very manly scented.</li>
    <li> Great scent, lasts long, and doesn&#x27;t burn or itch. Surprisingly better than Tom&#x27;s. It works so well that I had to check again to make sure it&#x27;s not filled with chemicals. I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> The deodorant smells &#x27;natural&#x27; in the applicator.  I tried this 2 days in a row and about half way through the day was appalled out how I could smell myself.  I&#x27;ve never had this happen with my usual Anti-perspirant/Deodorant.  Shipping mine back to Amazon.  I thought the lack of aluminum sounded nice, but according to webmd and snopes these worries are unfounded.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it is so difficult to find a good deodorant. I have yet to find the perfect deodorant for myself, so I think I will forever be on the quest to find it. For awhile, I used only natural deodorants. Finding a good natural deodorant is especially difficult. Most of them smell strange, have a weird texture, or aren&#x27;t effective at all. Of all the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, this was the best one. I liked the &#x27;forest&#x27; smell, the consistency was nice and it glided on smoothly, and it was pretty effective for a natural deodorant. What I didn&#x27;t like about it is that it didn&#x27;t last all day for me, unlike other reviewers have stated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this deodorant for a few months, but I no longer use it because I am still continuing my quest for a better deodorant. Maybe if I keep believing, then one day I will find it...</li>
    <li> truth is with these natural deoderants is that you&#x27;re never going to be 100% pretocted like one with anti-perspirant but this one is pretty decent. Some natural deoderants leave you smelling foul at the end of the day, not tis one. Just a tiny bit foul.</li>
    <li> This deodorant smells great. For a couple of hours. It might work perfectly for folks who don&#x27;t get as funky as I do, but not for me.</li>
    <li> The smell is great and it holds for most of the day. Nice to wear something that is all natural and has no chemicals in it.</li>
    <li> My son loves the deodorant.</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of these, one of each fragrance. I really like how it goes on. It works great. It lasts all day and virtually eliminated all the odor. This is my new deodorant.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Doesn&#x27;t work quite as long as the ones with all the crap in them but it&#x27;s ok. I would and will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased a two different scent versions and neither of them worked for me.  I could shower in the morning, put this deodorant on, and by the time I get to work, I stank - riding in an airconditioned car.  I loved the scents for both, but it is useless for me.  I would recommend that you buy one and try it first to see if the formula works for you before buying more than one.  I now have two or three of them at home that I am just going to have to toss.  To be fair, I have the same issue with the Tom of Maine&#x27;s products too.  I am going to have to go back to the mineral one or try my hand at making my own maybe.</li>
    <li> its natural does the job</li>
    <li> Something nobody can say about Axe.  Smells and feels great.  Will return for more for sure.</li>
    <li> the fragrance is fine but this in no way could be considered a antiperspirant. It smells good for an hour and that is all you get. After an eight hour work day in the office it was embarrassing to have anyone come close to me. &amp;#34;Maximum Protection&amp;#34;? From what?</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It&#x27;s one of the only non-aluminum deoderants that really really work! My husband and I both use it (well i use the girly smell one!)</li>
    <li> Best of the unknown deodorants, lasts all day with a great fragrance</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s suppose to do and keeps me fresh all day, without irritating my skin, or blocking pores which can lead to the ole uncomfortable perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product!</li>
    <li> Works well in winter.  Well see what happens when summer comes. So far it feels good and doesnt lose effect.</li>
    <li> awesome came protected with a reflector and dry ice.  Great product!</li>
    <li> God this smells amazing. I will literally shove my face in to my hubs armpit when he wears it, which unfortunately is not often enough!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been attempting to find a healthy deodorant that actually works.  This product actually works very well, but I did not realize that it has zinc when I purchased it.  Like aluminum, zinc has a moderate health risk. According to goodguide.com, Zinc is suspected of causing developmental, reproductive, respiratory, cardiovascular or blood toxicity, and immunotoxicity. So although it works, I wish they would have excluded the zinc.  I think I will go try Hugo next, Chrystal did not work for me or my wife.</li>
    <li> I like wearing more masculine-smelling deodorants and I really like the pine smell of this one. Unfortunately it irritated my armpits a bit, however I think mine are on the sensitive side.&lt;br /&gt;It does slick on feeling a bit wet, but if you don&#x27;t mind that and aren&#x27;t sensitive to tea tree oil, I think this is another great product by herban cowboy. I&#x27;d definitely be into a guy wearing this, haha</li>
    <li> A quality natural deodorant. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant, I was having allergic reactions to just about every other product but not this one. The sent isnt to strong either and that is what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> NOT so happy with this purchase.  Hoping it would be &amp;#34;the answer&amp;#34; to natural deodorant, but it&#x27;s not for me.  Salt rock works better . . . but I think out body chemistry is the clue to what will and won&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
    <li> I decided to give up on antiperspirants several months ago because I was tired of those yellow arm pit stains on my t-shirts. I discovered Herban Cowboy Forest and have been happy every since. My t-shirts stay white while I stay smelling fresh all day long. It doesn&#x27;t last all day without re-applying if you sweat a lot. That doesn&#x27;t matter because I bought two and carry one with me at work.</li>
    <li> Conventional deodorants have given me breakouts of rash and acne lately. Most natural deodorants don&#x27;t last all day or smell funny. This stuff smells great, lasts my entire sweaty work day, and does not break me out. The item arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
    <li> Been using for a couple of weeks.  I like it so far</li>
    <li> Very nice woodsy scent and works great!</li>
    <li> Smells and feels great. Easy to apply and lasts all day without an overpowering scent.</li>
    <li> works well, lasts longer than others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Unique.  Not overpowering.  The only questionable ingredient is probably propanediol, though different agencies list it on either side of &#x27;ok.&#x27;</li>
    <li> great scent for woman or man!</li>
    <li> chemicals just work better than natural stuff. I&#x27;m a guy if that matters in perspiration/stink department. It&#x27;s hard to make this last all day. I&#x27;m thinking about just wearing when I don&#x27;t want pit stains on nice clothes. Smell was good though, not strong. I&#x27;d like to be natural but random wiffs of your b.o. while wearing d.o. sucks.</li>
    <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. It smells great and leaves very little, if any, residue on my clothes, and lasts all day long. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> When I first started looking into deoderants without aluminum I picked up the Every Man Jack stick, I liked the way it smelled, but it didn&#x27;t last long, so usually by the end of the day I was smelling again (and i&#x27;m not a very smelly/sweaty person). That&#x27;s when I picked up the Herban Cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great. It smells awesome, and it lasts me nearly 48 hours. What I like about the product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good&lt;br /&gt;-Lasts long&lt;br /&gt;-Goes on dry/doesn&#x27;t smudge&lt;br /&gt;-Comes in a well built applicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the stick is small (ie not as wide as a normal stick of deodorant), that&#x27;s why I gave it the 4 stars instead of 5, but that&#x27;s really only a minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deodorant scent. It smells more natural than most of the big name brands out there, and doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. The biggest flaw with this product is that the scent is short lived. After about an hour or two, its virtually non-existent. Fix this issue, and it will be near perfect.</li>
    <li> This is their older version that still has the ingredient the description claims it doesn&#x27;t. This version has not been in production for over 2 years. How do I know? I bought it from Vitacost that long ago and that one was already reformulated to exclude alum.&lt;br /&gt;This one also does not smell that good, while the new(er) formula smells divine.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I returned it...</li>
    <li> I used it a little while and it gave me a rash and it didn&#x27;t last long during the day.  I ended up hucking the rest of the stick.</li>
    <li> This deodorant has a unique smell, unlike I&#x27;ve ever smelled before. It is not a pine-type forest smell; rather, it&#x27;s a perfumey woods smell. It goes on smooth and lasts a decent amount of time, although not a 10-hour work day in the summer. I will probably not buy this again as it is too perfumey for my taste.  *** For alternatives, here are the two deodorants I prefer and have had good luck with: If you want a true WOODSY smell, try Every Man Jack Cedarwood men&#x27;s deodorant. It works just as well as the Herban Cowboy and is not  as perfume like smelling.  If you want a natural authentic pine smell, try Tom&#x27;s of Maine &amp;#34;Maine Woodspice&amp;#34; scent deodorant. To me, this is by far the best smelling deodorant out there. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t last very long; for me, in the summer, it requires being re-applied after half a day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> I have searched and searched for a deodorant that is affordable, natural, and actually works. I came on amazon to check out the &amp;#34;Jungleman&amp;#34; brand which I had read good things about and found this. I bought this and the jungleman to compare. Havent used the jungleman yet but I can say that this stuff works really well. Of course its not going to work as well as something with aluminum (an anti-perspirant) but it almost always lasts all day long. The &amp;#34;Forest&amp;#34; scent smells amazing. My wife loves it. Very natural smelling. Not chemically overpowering like Axe or other &amp;#34;mainstream&amp;#34; sticks.</li>
    <li> My favorites deodorant. Have been through many, some more expensive, but since finding this its all I use</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours so might not want to use it year round if you sweat a bit. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> When you want your pits to make a statement, this is the product for you. I love the scent as does my significant other. I do some international flights I wish the airline would give this stuff away on. Luckily, on those flights when it&#x27;s nap time, I can rest my head on either shoulder with confidence...</li>
    <li> I ordered this deodorant for my husband.  It does not provide the protection he thought he would get.  At the end of the day, he feels smelly.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance and more importantly it actually works well.  I have bought this a few times and my daughter asked for it after she smelled it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to stay away from regular deodorants that have all those bad chemicals in them, zince, alluminum, ect. Tom&#x27;s was the one I would use prior to this, but Tom&#x27;s smell didnt last for more than 15mins before the protection dissipates. Herban Cowboy (which i bought because of all the great reviews) definitely delivers!. It smells awesome and protects for almost the whole day. 10/10 would buy again</li>
    <li> Great price and favorite scent. Lasts all day. This is very effective I don&#x27;t sweat a drop. This is the only good deoderant I can find that doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out in a rash, nor bleach the underarms of my shirts. I won&#x27;t think twice recommending this.</li>
    <li> Smells good for a few hours, but it is not strong enough to handle the AZ heat. The smell is fantastic, but it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it should do. And it&#x27;s not sticky or clumpy. It comes off in the shower. It was one component of replacing all of my cruelty-based cosmetics. I&#x27;m going to keep trying other deodorants, but only to sample as much of what&#x27;s out there as possible. This one is a winner though.</li>
    <li> I used to be pretty brand loyal to Old Spice antiperspirants.  My father and wife swayed me to move away from aluminum filled antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Tom&#x27;s Of Maine and Arm &amp; Hammer aluminum free deodorants.  Both left me with peeling skin under my arms like I had a bad sunburn.  My wife found this Herban Cowboy Forest Deodorant, and I have had no negative reaction to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply this every day, and one stick has lasted me roughly 3 months.  The only downside to it barely lasts through my 10 hour work day (about 2-3 hours sitting and 7-8 hours moving around).</li>
    <li> Pretty good deodorant. Doesn&#x27;t hold up if I sweat too much.</li>
    <li> I bought it under the assumption that it did not contain aluminum. It is advertised as natural and not containing aluminum chlorohydrate. It does contain Potassium Aluminum Sulfate; listed as Potassium Alum. It does smell good, and I will probably use it rather than return it. I&#x27;m just kind of bummed that it contains Aluminum.</li>
    <li> This product smells good at first but after about a week it does not mask the smell its as if you never put deodorant on in the first place.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance for a couple of hours and then nothing. Provided no odor protection when you sweat. VERY  disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> When I went off of mainstream, chemical laden antiperspirants, I took my husband down with me. He&#x27;s a good sport and did not give me a hard time with trying something new. It happens that there are is a lot of Alzheimer&#x27;s and dementia running in his family and he understood maybe there was a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While he tried a spray deodorant for awhile, he developed irritation. I liked that this one was a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; alternative, but still looked and felt like the deodorants he was used to using on a daily basis. This one has been a winner. He loved it so much, we&#x27;ve now bought more for him. He has no complaints, it works well and we both like the smell. His usual scent is Forest.</li>
    <li> Wears off a bit fast, but it smells great and it slides on rather smoothly.</li>
    <li> I used to use Tom&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant, but they switched the formula and my skin started peeling.  This deodorant is great.</li>
    <li> I could write poetry to the sweetness you have brought back into my life and the air around me, Herban Cowboy.    I can now move around freely without wondering where you are. You hold me close, letting absolutely no stench escape from my gardens. Herban Cowboy, you even stayed overnight. When I woke up in the morning, you were still there. Tom&#x27;s was never, ever that for me. He left me neither high nor dry over and over again, and I was in denial as to what a symbiotic relationship should be. (And though you do contain silver, you aren&#x27;t giving me heavy metal neurological damage.)</li>
    <li> says aluminum free but i still developed an allergic reaction to it, as did other reviewers. something in the ingredient list is an irritant, plus the scent didn&#x27;t last, and i don&#x27;t sweat profusely. i&#x27;ll stick to Tom&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but doesn&#x27;t work, at all.</li>
    <li> Just like everyone else I have been trying to find an alternative to aluminum based deordants. I think every one has a different PH or results no matter what they try. I have tried so many with no perfect results from one product but so far I have found a great combonation. For me at least I use this Herban Cowbay product after I shower at the end of my day and then in the morning befor work I apply the non scented Kiss My Face deodorant and perfect combo. For some reason this has been an amazing combo for me but might not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it at the local health store, best stuff. No aluminum and none of that other stuff you want.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty nice; a good, woodsy smell. The problem is that the scent wears off within a couple of hours, making it ineffective. It may work differently for different people, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> Pretty good scent...no too strong but just right...I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but doesn&#x27;t quite work for me. Wears off after a few hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not an overly smelly guy... with that said, this deodorant only lasts for about 5 hours or so and that&#x27;s not with much activity.&lt;br /&gt;The scent does smell good, while it lasts, but there&#x27;s no maximum protection about it.</li>
    <li> Great scent as others have said, however, it seems to wear off after a few hours.  Its the only deodorant that has left me with body odor that I recall ever using.  Wont be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  I was afraid that it would not provide adequate protection from odor, but it does an excellent job.  It also has a mild, clean scent that is very pleasing.</li>
    <li> The smell is fantastic. I can&#x27;t get enough of it. I wanted to love this product but by midday or early afternoon at the latest, the odor blocking power is completely exhausted. Also don&#x27;t expect any protection against sweat. Suppose this stuff would be acceptable if you reapplied throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! I tried everything and always ended up smelling like a toilet bowl cleaner with slight BO mixed in at the end of the day. This product has been amazing. I had low to no hope ( too many dissappointments over the years) ... And am immensely happy!!!! No BO, just a nice , sweet,  non-harsh scent at the end of the day. 10,000 stars!</li>
    <li> This is possibly one of the best smelling deodorants I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. For all of 1 hour. This simply does not last. Furthermore, there&#x27;s a very tight reapplication window that you must hit on the dot, if you miss it, you&#x27;ve been warned. Forst musk + musk musk &#x3D; foul abound. Amazing by itself, terrible with anything else. If I&#x27;m going out for dinner or going to an event that&#x27;s cold, I go back to it always but for every day in any heat, just doesn&#x27;t cut it. If only they made this smell with some antiperspirant, or silver or something. (Yes, defeats the vegan aspect, but 1 hour or less just doesn&#x27;t cut it.)&lt;br /&gt;I even tried an unscented rollon antiperspirant then put this on top but it&#x27;s a very wet deodorant. If it can&#x27;t absorb, it won&#x27;t dry (think the wetness of really wet chapstick). Again, amazing smell but just doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> This did work for me for up to about 16 hours.  It is less expensive, and has more ingredients than Truly&#x27;s and JungleMan but Truly&#x27;s and JungleMan works much longer for me.</li>
    <li> Finally!!!  A deodorant that works!! I use this and baby powder on top (otherwise, it stays sticky).  Donna Karen Cashmere started to fail me and I was desperate to find a new deodorant. This stuff is amazing!! I have tried EVERYTHING else - everything they sell at Target to the most expensive of expensive products at Neiman Marcus to prescription products. THIS IS THE ONLY STUFF THAT WORKS for me!!! So glad I found it.</li>
    <li> This might be the best deodorant I have ever tried and Forest is Urban Cowboy&#x27;s best scent. I recently switched from regular anti perspiring deodorant and have been more conscious about parabens. I never thought this would be a possibility for me and tried a few times in the past. I find that the ultimate solution is a thai crystal and then some of this over the top so you have a nice fresh scent without all the skin clogging agents. I play sports, work out and work an office job. BO is not an option but now I have finally found the solution. No stickiness like toms and other options I have tried. Great products urban cowboy! Worth the price.</li>
    <li> It smells good but sometimes makes you armpits feel wet. Not sure if it&#x27;d be good as an antiperspirant but it&#x27;s good at deodorizing.</li>
    <li> Here are the actual ingredients: Propanediol, aloe, water, Sodium Stearate, ** Mineral Salts **, Rice Starch, Ethylhexylglycerin, Rosemary extract, Parsley Extract, Sage Extract, Allantoin, Bisabolol, Fragrance.  I would *not* have purchased this product if I knew it contained &amp;#34;mineral salts&amp;#34; (potential source of aluminum).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an OK deodorant I suppose (unless you&#x27;re physically active in which case it just gets in the way) but the scent is so subtle that I have to convince myself that it&#x27;s there.</li>
    <li> Smells great and all natural, but doesn&#x27;t last that long for me.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Sticky wet application. After working in a warehouse environment, lifting, constant movement my armpits smelled bad, I bought 3 different deodorants to test, 2 naturals and 1 organic, the organic worked better.</li>
    <li> Hooray for smelling good and not causing harm to our bodies with chemicals. I prefer this deodorant to Tom&#x27;s because it lasts longer and has a bit of a stronger scent. Good man smells.</li>
    <li> Not convinced it works since I bought it for my husband and I still smell his odor. I will say the odor is more bearable than before with traditional deodoarants like old spice etcetera. Ill keep trying though.</li>
    <li> I love Herban Cowboy products. This scent is my favorite in the line. I no longer use regular deodorants because of these products. They work well for odor and wetness on my body. I am a fan.</li>
    <li> Smells good and I do not get sweaty when using, but the sent just cannot cover up the manly smell. Does not break me out either, but I don&#x27;t like to stink after a few hrs. Will keep looking for something  better.</li>
    <li> Does not last all day. My husband said he felt gross after a few hours</li>
    <li> Ok but does not work for long and armpits definitely had a little b.o. later during the day!</li>
    <li> Works better than a similar Tom&#x27;s of Maine product.  Just one or two swipes of this stuff and it seems to last all day.  The fragrance is not overpowering but you know it is there...it is a nice fresh forest smell.</li>
    <li> Best deodorant i&#x27;ve ever had. The stick lasts forever. (like 4 months). Keeps me dry all day. I even put some on my forearm and at the end of the day you could still tell it was there. All natural. No aluminium. Smells like pine needles.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works. It&#x27;s difficult to find a product without aluminum that actually works. This one works well &amp; has a pleasant smell.</li>
    <li> I really hoped this stuff would work for me but it just didn&#x27;t. It smells divine and does work for a few hours, but it definitely doesn&#x27;t offer an all-day protection. My funk wins every time. I do keep it with me as backup.</li>
    <li> Very good the smell last a lot!! the whole 24 hours. and its is smell good.</li>
    <li> I like this natural deodorant, as I want to avoid aluminum.  It works pretty well all day.</li>
    <li> Awesome manly scent and it goes on clear. Doesn&#x27;t feel all gooey when applied like some natural deodorants can. I will be purchasing again and possibly in another scent just to see what the others smell like.</li>
    <li> Really like the smell of this deodorant (for my husband, smells &#x27;manly&#x27;) and it works well. Lasts for the whole day (but only for office job/ no high physical activity!:). One of the only &#x27;natural&#x27; deodorants we have tried that actually works and does not irritate the skin.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t work against odor.  I really wanted it to but I ended up smelling myself (in a bad way) several hours after application.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this is only for Herban Cowboys. All other needs not apply. Not nearly powerful enough to cover up my man scent. So the chemicals will eat my brain and I will die a cancer riddled 40 year old - but it will be better than some chick stabbing me to death with her eyebrow pencil on the subway. Bruh, I stank.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells good and it&#x27;s nice to have an all natural option. However, it doesn&#x27;t work all that well. Quite simply, it&#x27;s liquid soluble. You can tell this if you apply it after a shower when you even slightly damp.. it will run down your side. Same thing must happen with sweat, because it basically lasts 1/2 a day and quickly wears off at the gym. It&#x27;s adequate for me because I don&#x27;t have an excessive body odor issue (I think), but it will run out twice as fast as a normal stick. I still would rather buy this over garbage, but hopefully they will find an all natural additive that will make it withstand liquid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 weeks. Sometimes I use it alone and sometimes I use it in conjunction with Thai Crystal deodorant stone per another reviewers suggestion. So far I&#x27;m not really impressed. Granted it does have a nice smell but this only lasts a couple of hours at best. I live in a warmer US climate so am used to perspiring and had hoped this would keep me smell-free for an entire work day but sadly it doesn&#x27;t. Regardless of how I use it (with or without Thai) I start to notice my pits by lunch time. It does roll on very smoothly and of course I love that it&#x27;s natural but it sadly doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this because I was looking for a more natural deodorant, in that respect, I was impressed. However, we wear deodorant because we don&#x27;t want to stink and that is were is product failed me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, but for me it only works half of the day. By about 2pm I can smell myself, if you can smell you then everyone else can smell you more.</li>
    <li> I have the same issues as so many others, after about 4 hours the scent goes away and you can smell that it&#x27;s gone. I really wanted this to work for me.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s all natural.  That&#x27;s about as good as it gets. Like most reviewers have noted the scent does not last long.  In fact I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s even on at times.  I personally enjoy having deodorant on that every so often you can smell which reminds me that the stuff is working.  Deodorant that works well enough that you are not bending your head to your pits to smell if it&#x27;s even there.  As someone mentioned when  you glide this on it leaves a very slimy residue and quite frankly feels very awkward.  To be fair I use this every morning when I get out of the shower so maybe that could be the reason but trust me when I say that I glide on only when the pits are dry.  Again, it&#x27;s natural so I do feel a tad bit better knowing I&#x27;m glazing over that region with herbs but I will warn you that you may experience a bit of a soothing, peppermint sensation as well.  So may enjoy that.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t order it but there&#x27;s always a market for items like this.  Good luck with your perspiring endeavors.</li>
    <li> So far so good, has a natural smell to it.</li>
    <li> My husband and I have been looking for deodorants without all the harmful crap that actually work for a long time, and this one is great!  My husband is kindof a big guy, so even some of the stronger store brands don&#x27;t always work for him, but this one does!  I&#x27;m so happy we&#x27;ve found something with simple ingredients that works!</li>
    <li> Subtle smell. Not really feminine, but works well being that it&#x27;s natural. You&#x27;d have to reapply throughout the day, if you&#x27;re doing strenuous activity.</li>
    <li> Stays wet, smells poor, doesn&#x27;t last long, not a big fan.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants; this one works as well as the aluminum types. I&#x27;m a funky guy, so that&#x27;s a real endorsement.</li>
    <li> Amazing aroma for your man!  His deo of choice!</li>
    <li> After trying crystal stones and other aluminum free products this is the best by far. This is a great aluminum free option for deodorant. The scent is a clean woodsy cedar scent. It is not over powering at all. I have been using this particular for well over a year.</li>
    <li> No nasty or potentially dangerous chemicals, it smells great and covers any BO. Kinda pricey, but so utterly worth it.</li>
    <li> Keeps me smelling fresh, and doesn&#x27;t cause the clothing stains you get with aluminum-based antiperspirants.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this deodorant. It works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin like store brands with aluminum</li>
    <li> It used to be great stuff.  They&#x27;ve changed the formulation.  It doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
    <li> Herban Cowboy, more like the perfect disguise. I am a professional air-softer/voice actor. In air soft you have to be aware sharp, focused, alert. Like a navy seal, except more intense. Your accuracy has to be spot on, you have to be aware of every sense. Some have said with my weight, (being excess of 275lbs of muscle (Bear mode here)) I cant keep up with a bunch of hungry skeletons. So I bought a gillie suit and hid in the treeline, however my sweat was giving away my position. When you are fit, you sweat a lot. Okay. So they would smell me out, with this deodorant I smell just like a tree, no one suspects a thing. I am the perfect warrior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, 5/5, two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try because my skin reacts badly to anything with aluminum in it.  Although I like the smell, the scent is pretty weak.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 2 weeks and am really disappointed with the odor control.  Even with no deodorant I don&#x27;t usually stink, but by the end of the day I don&#x27;t smell fresh.  With Herban Cowboy I feel like I get BO within an hour of getting out of the shower and applying.  I read another review that said the BO almost seemed amplified and I would agree with that.  I&#x27;ve never had the stink stick to the underarms of my shirts before and now they reek.  I gave this to my wife and am going back to Old Spice.</li>
    <li> Wow, does this stuff work well and smell really, really good. I&#x27;ve been searching and searching for years for an effective deodorant that uses natural ingredients instead of gross chemicals, ever since Tom&#x27;s of Maine changed the formulation of their once excellent and now ineffective Woodspice deodorant. Such a product has proven impossible to find... and I tried a LOT of deodorants. Enter Forest! Forest is every bit as good as the old Woodspice -- perhaps better. It&#x27;s kept me fresh during two-hour long intense aerobic workouts (even in shirts made of wicking fabric, which we all know can get pretty rank), when I reapply without showering, and when I am out gardening in very hot weather. Thank you, Herban Cowboy -- it&#x27;s been a long (and stinky) wait. Also, it has a woodsy scent (obviously), but smells great enough to be androgenous -- it&#x27;s not Axe or Old Spice-like at all, just yummy.</li>
    <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t even come close to lasting through an 8-hour work day. I sit at a desk all day and this stuff wears off by lunch time.</li>
    <li> Smells great...but only for a little while.</li>
    <li> This is just a deodorant I understand however it falls flat after about 4 hours or so. I ride my bike to and from work and i&#x27;m not riding aggressively however after a weeks worth of usage, my pits are funky all the time. And I shower 2x a day because I hate sweat. I&#x27;m going to go back to anti-perspirants.</li>
    <li> Good stuff! Works great for my teenage boy.</li>
    <li> My husband was so worried about switching to an all natural deodorant but he love this. It smells great and manly and keeps him fresh all day. He works outdoors in Arizona so that is saying a LOT about this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling best working safest deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. It actually builds fragrance the more you sweat. I just bought five more units of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I even bought the other fragrances as well. And the girlie version for my wife.</li>
    <li> This smells good but this is a deodorant not a antiperspirant. Doesn&#x27;t last all day either. who needs just a deodorant these days? pointless.</li>
    <li> Smells rad, does it&#x27;s job, no crappy ingredients.</li>
    <li> The smell is simple and not overly potent.&lt;br /&gt;Good choice if you&#x27;d rather not smell like a child.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any metals in it and goes on smooth, I had irritation issues with previous deodorants but none with this.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and good god does it smell amazing.  Ladies, if you&#x27;re trying to get your male companion to make the switch from an antiperspirant to something more safe, I highly recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Great deodorant with out all the extra crap that the big companies use in their products.</li>
    <li> I caught a whiff of this at Central Market and thought it was the best smelling deodorant I had ever put under my nose. Pricey though it is, I thought I would give it a shot. First natural deodorant I have ever tried. After a few months of use, I&#x27;ve determined that despite its amazing scent, this deodorant does not mask my body odor. The scent persists throughout the day, longer than most other deodorants actually, but it does nothing to hide my natural musk. The two smells exist at the same time, strangely enough, so that I can smell both myself the deodorant. It&#x27;s too bad because I really want to like it. But a deodorant that doesn&#x27;t de-odor is useless to me. That&#x27;s what I use cologne for. 3* for scent and trying.</li>
    <li> This is what I imagine Brad Pitt naturally smells like.  They soak up his aromatic sweat, and somehow fit all of that manly awesomeness into this deodorant stick.  I love using this, as it covers up my stank, and makes my wife jump on top of me whenever I lift my arm to expose my Pitt-aroma.  BUY THIS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, it&#x27;s all natural and lasts a long time too!</li>
    <li> smells like a man... thats what my son said. he was tired of girly scented deodorants when i told him he had to use more natural stuff so i say its a hit</li>
    <li> Works well, has a nice scent and does not have bad ingredients</li>
    <li> I like the smell  but it didn&#x27;t cut down on the odor  it might just be me</li>
    <li> I was almost sold on this deodorant. The first day I wore it I was home all day so I thought cool  It works. But I wore it the next day and I move around alot at work, I never sweat at work. For some strange reason one of my under arms was funky but the other wasnt about half way into my 11 hour shift. Since thats a pet peeve of mine, me never having BO in puplic I still wear it on days when I know Im staying home to give my body a break from the aluminum chlorohydrate.</li>
    <li> When you first open it, the deodorant smells great. But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this thing doesn&#x27;t match with my body chemistry but it makes me smell like some serious butt/funk after an hour or so after use. I smell worse with the deodorant!</li>
    <li> Smells so good. Disappears so fast. I don&#x27;t have body odor issues unless I&#x27;ve been eating a lot of certain foods (indian spiced food, onions, garlic, etc) so this isn&#x27;t typically an issue, but I also live in the cold northwest so your mileage may vary. Wears off like half way through the day.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
    <li> This deodorant was very gentle on my skin.  I find a lot of deodorants to cause irritations to my skin.  The scent is very nice, but mild.  It doesn&#x27;t take a week or more to get use to wearing the scent.  The price is very respectable.  I have a very hard time finding natural deodorants in my home town, so I was pleased that I found a reasonably priced one here that works and smells good.</li>
    <li> I cannot recommend this as it gave me a rash which I have never had with any deodorant before.  I emailed Herban Cowboy directly (copy below) and did not hear back. I switched back to Tom&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---------&lt;br /&gt;Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I wanted to say that I was excited to learn that a Minneapolis based company was offering vegan grooming/hygiene products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I have had a bad experience with the first HC deodorant I tried--the Forest version. My underarms itched and turned slightly red after use. I&#x27;m a scientist, so I had to be sure and used it on three different days, with 3 and 6 days between the trials, to ensure there was no confounding or other factor. Sure enough, same reaction each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would reach out to you to see if you have had other reports of issues/allergies with this product. I haven&#x27;t had a reaction like this before and imagine it is the fragrance, but am not sure. I have no known allergies. If it helps, the lot/marking on the container is 5008A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks and I wish you continued success with your enterprise!</li>
    <li> decent. but i wouldn&#x27;t buy again, there are better natural products out there.</li>
    <li> I hate giving bad reviews, but for me this product just doesn&#x27;t work. It smells good when first put on in the morning, but by the end of the day I smell much worse than if I had used no deodorant at all. I&#x27;ve never had an odor problem with traditional deodorants, but am trying to use fewer chemicals in my life. I guess I&#x27;ll keep looking for a natural deodorant that works or go back to the old Mitchum.</li>
    <li> It is not an effective deodorant. Disappointed with the amount of applications throughout the day and it still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
</ol>
