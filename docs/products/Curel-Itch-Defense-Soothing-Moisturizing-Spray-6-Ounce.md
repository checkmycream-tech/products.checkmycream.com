### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, this is a wonderful product</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so great!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for something to stop the itch, and I am rarely impressed with what I find.  </li>
      <li>Curel Itch Defense Soothing Moisturizing Spray is the best thing that has happened to me this summer.</li>
      <li>Awesome solution for summertime allergies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While the sprayer could be improved, I&#x27;m so happy to find relief that I&#x27;m upgrading my review to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s excellent for that, and feels nice everywhere.</li>
      <li>This is great.</li>
      <li>it is great.  </li>
      <li>It was soothing and the smell was pleasant, but not overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the chlorine, but either way, this felt really good</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the good news.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, for smooth, happy skin, this is the stuff to use!</li>
      <li>product, Itch Defense Soothing Moisturizing Spray, is another good product.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s a good thing.)</li>
      <li>This is a surprisingly good product.  </li>
      <li>Packaging aside, the lotion does a reasonably good job easing an itch but would be just as good in a squeeze bottle.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t make out any perfumes or overbearing scents, making it ideal for men and women, no matter what your favorite fragrance is.</li>
      <li>Every bit as good as its counterpart, Curely Itch Defense Lotion, in that it soothes and eventually calms the need to itch.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I also encountered some shaving rash on my legs and this stuff worked like magic!</li>
      <li>Aerosol lotion might be a great idea, but the smooth can design is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>It kind of clogs and doesn&#x27;t spray evenly until it has cleared out and be then I am almost done.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe how good this product is.</li>
      <li>Nice.</li>
      <li>The bottle claims a &amp;#34;proprietary cooling complex,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t notice any cooling sensation when I used it warm (from my car)</li>
      <li>Honestly though, I was relieved that I wasn&#x27;t scratching that I didn&#x27;t care.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However - the spray nozzle clogs very easily, and then instead of a nice, even spray, you get a stream that flies everywhere.</li>
      <li>Curel is an excellent moisturizer, highly recommended by our family dermatologist.</li>
      <li>was accurate and fair.</li>
      <li>A very light citrus/orange smell.</li>
      <li>favorite part of this moisturizer is the SMELL.</li>
      <li>even more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Like many spray lotions, this can has a twist locking cap to keep it from spraying accidentally.</li>
      <li>I should have paid more attention, I suppose...</li>
      <li>If I run out I will get more, because this stuff works&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>you are anything like me and love to run around in flip flops, shorts and a t-shirt</li>
      <li>The spray bottle works OK, but you still have to rub the thinned out moisturizer into your skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update the review when it&#x27;s out and tell you how many days of morning and night usage worked out to being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wish there was a setting where you can get more of a wider application.</li>
      <li>sure to use the spray in an upright position so the mist comes out evenly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was hoping you could just spray it on without rubbing it in, which would be great for really tender</li>
      <li>It has a mild and pleasant, clean</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very cool</li>
      <li>What this means to me is that this is a super product for parents to spray on a child, but not as perfect for individual use.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a spray lotion -- and I liked it.</li>
      <li>Have no reason to believe that this method of using the product is less effective than the lotion version, as I have already have experienced the efficient way in which it helps against itching.</li>
      <li>The product is great and the packaging is fine but a line or two of how to open and use the spray canister would have been helpful in my opinion.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another great use is for my hairless Chinese Crested Dog.</li>
      <li>Plus, while the lotion is quite light, it still just sits on the skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, but it&#x27;s something that you&#x27;ll have to do every time you use it.</li>
      <li>However unlike bottled lotions, this one spreads easily and absorbs quickly into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve always liked Curel lotion, but in the more traditional pump or squeeze containers.  </li>
      <li>On top of that, it really conditions the skin</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
      <li>I love how this one easily sprays out of the can; just twist the top to unlock, then depress the sprayer.</li>
      <li>would (Nivea makes the best body cream in a blue tin), but suitable for when you don&#x27;t have an hour to blend in a heavy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Also, Curel smells medicinal to me like menthol and eucalyptus (which are listed as ingredients), though the scent dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>but just a quick spray of this creamy lotion</li>
      <li>Luckily, he outgrew his eczema, so I can&#x27;t test it on eczema to see if it helps.</li>
      <li>This should last a good while, making it economical too.</li>
      <li>Very refreshing, uplifting, and soothing at the same time!</li>
      <li>The locking cap is nice; it might make you pause for a moment to make sure it&#x27;s in the right position, but when closed, there are no accidental</li>
      <li>The lotion also absorbed quickly into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>product itself is good for immediate relief of itchy dry skin.</li>
      <li>The can is easy to hold, even with wet/ damp hands,  thanks to its shape.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well and is in a very convenient spray can.</li>
      <li>The spray is thicker than you give it credit for initially, so at first, it is easy to spray on too much, but</li>
      <li>--my locked car quickly exceeds 120° on a hot day.</li>
      <li>This is a nice, light, neutral hydrating lotion, typical for Curel, but the spray doesn&#x27;t appeal to me at all.</li>
      <li>short, it might be less expensive to purchase a Curel product not in a spray can if it&#x27;s for yourself, but the product is another excellent Curel item, and I bet it would be perfect for post-beach trips.</li>
      <li>On top of that, the can says not to store above 120°F</li>
      <li>It just so happened I have poison ivy for the first time in my life.  </li>
      <li>When we turned to use it for the first time, the cap cracked, jabbed me in the thumb and wouldn&#x27;t work after that.</li>
      <li>This is the first time I have tried a spray type moisturizing lotion</li>
      <li>so be aware of that.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Curel products for many years, especially during those winter months when, much like my Dad, my ankles always because really dry and itchy, and no amount of product could save me from scarred-looking legs which made it look as if I&#x27;d been through some kind of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Super highly recommend</li>
      <li>lotion is cooling and provides a nice relief, although the anti-itching effect doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  </li>
      <li>I live in a desert and it has very low humidity most of the year.  </li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t a &#x27;spray and go&#x27; operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like regular Curel, the moisturizer works fine.</li>
      <li>A few years ago, I had a cream that was amazing</li>
      <li>What I really did not like was the smell.</li>
      <li>and I have to admit I really like it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Being summer, I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with itchy skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Aside from the fact I was allergic to the spray itself, which is not the product&#x27;s fault, I really did not like it.  </li>
      <li>Where has this spray been my whole life?</li>
      <li>But as winter arrives, I get very itchy hands and arms, and I am looking forward to using this lotion.</li>
      <li>I really like the Curel brand.</li>
      <li>It does work, with a light-weight spray that is very soothing on the skin.</li>
      <li>Hey, this stuff really works.</li>
      <li>It does help stop itching, and the lotion itself feels nice and isn&#x27;t heavily scented.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to get this lotion spread over a large area, although it takes a little while to soak in.</li>
      <li>This spray goes on light and cool feeling and has a slight citrus scent.  </li>
      <li>(OK, not new, but as new as any part of me can be.)</li>
      <li>all, I&#x27;m pleased and Curel is a good brand, not one that I&#x27;ve had trouble with breakouts before (even old ladies get acne from heavy stuff).  </li>
      <li>The initial burst left more lotion than at the end of the &#x27;sweep&#x27; down my arm or leg, but the cream spread easily enough that I thought &#x27;fairly evenly&#x27;</li>
      <li>For a product line that is not overly expensive, this latest addition is another sure winner, with the added plus that now it can be used via spray.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried a spray type moisturizing lotion and I have to admit I really like it. It is easier and faster to apply, even though you still have rub it into your skin. However unlike bottled lotions, this one spreads easily and absorbs quickly into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I tried was after feeding my chickens after a terrible rain storm. Of course after a rain storm comes massive amounts of mosquitoes looking to feast. I was wearing shorts and a short sleeve shirt and they took advantage of my exposed skin. I sprayed Curel Itch Defense wondering if it would help keep from me scratching the bites and by golly it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great use is for my hairless Chinese Crested Dog. My Vet has always told me to use Curel lotion since his skin is always exposed to the elements and has to be taken care constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use the spray in an upright position so the mist comes out evenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel is a name I have always trusted.</li>
    <li> This worked well on moderately dry skin, not sure how it would work on a severe case of eczema.  It was soothing and the smell was pleasant, but not overpowering.  I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the spay bottle, it worked fine.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Curel products for many years, especially during those winter months when, much like my Dad, my ankles always because really dry and itchy, and no amount of product could save me from scarred-looking legs which made it look as if I&#x27;d been through some kind of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, Itch Defense Soothing Moisturizing Spray, is another good product.  Like those other Curel skin treatments, it is cooling, relieving, and you can immediately sense the rich, healing properties at work.  It has a mild and pleasant, clean scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think the spray concept needs some work.  The 6oz pressurized bottle/can is awkward and it is difficult to deliver the product to areas of the body which are not directly available to the non-contortionist.  What frequently happens is I end up smoothing on the product with my hands anyway.  What this means to me is that this is a super product for parents to spray on a child, but not as perfect for individual use.  The locking cap is nice; it might make you pause for a moment to make sure it&#x27;s in the right position, but when closed, there are no accidental discharges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it might be less expensive to purchase a Curel product not in a spray can if it&#x27;s for yourself, but the product is another excellent Curel item, and I bet it would be perfect for post-beach trips.</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention, I suppose...but if you are allergic to citrus, this is not the anti-itch solution for you.  It made me break out in itchy bumps after testing it on my well-chewed-by-biting-insects legs.  Now, they are red, blotchy, and really itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the fact I was allergic to the spray itself, which is not the product&#x27;s fault, I really did not like it.  The bottle is slippery, and that is before you get any of the lotion on your hands.  Afterwards, forget trying to hang onto it and spray the stuff without making a mess of you and the surrounding area.  Aerosol lotion might be a great idea, but the smooth can design is impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always liked Curel lotion, but in the more traditional pump or squeeze containers.  This one bombed.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. After I have been on a bike ride and my arms are sun burned and wind burned, they are pretty miserable. They even look dry. One spray per each arm and rub it in and they feel like new. (OK, not new, but as new as any part of me can be.) A few years ago, I had a cream that was amazing but they quit making it (of course). I have been looking for a replacement and this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray part, however, I am a little iffy on. It kind of clogs and doesn&#x27;t spray evenly until it has cleared out and be then I am almost done. Plus, you have to spread it around and rub it in, so you might as well have squeezed it out of a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for smooth, happy skin, this is the stuff to use!</li>
    <li> It works. I can&#x27;t think of a better way to describe how good this product is. It really does relieve itching, particularly itching caused by dry or sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light, neutral hydrating lotion, typical for Curel, but the spray doesn&#x27;t appeal to me at all. I find the spray pump difficult to direct and the amount of product coming out hard to control--and you still have to rub it in, as with any lotion. The one advantage I can see for it would be for applying to as squirmy kid--easier to apply one-handed. For your own application, it&#x27;s just kind of messy &amp; dumb. On top of that, the can says not to store above 120°F--my locked car quickly exceeds 120° on a hot day. And it kinda gunks up at the spray hole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is good for immediate relief of itchy dry skin. I&#x27;m using it on a tattoo that&#x27;s about 10 days old, just when it starts to look healed but really itch like the dickens. It definitely soothes dry skin itch. It&#x27;s excellent for that, and feels nice everywhere. It&#x27;s light, thin, and soaks in right away. I was hoping you could just spray it on without rubbing it in, which would be great for really tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel cooler than regular lotion upon application, but I think that&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s watery, so you get a little evaporative cooling action. The bottle claims a &amp;#34;proprietary cooling complex,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t notice any cooling sensation when I used it warm (from my car), I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s got any menthol-y cooling ingredients (which is good, since those can be irritating on a sunburn or sensitive raw skin).</li>
    <li> Everyone has a target zone: a part of one&#x27;s anatomy that reacts to stress, environmental factors, life.  Mine is skin.  I itch.  A lot.  Use the wrong detergent and itch.  Handle the wrong metals and itch.  Use a band-aid and itch.  Walk within a mile of a bug, be bitten, and itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was once explained to me by a medical professional that itching is borderline pain, and from someone who suffered from a 2-year run of hives, I can attest to the truth of that.  Itching is also time-consuming.  We itchers spend a lot of time trying not to scratch, scratching, and thinking about our itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am always looking for something to stop the itch, and I am rarely impressed with what I find.  So I was a bit dubious about CUREL ITCH DEFENSE SOOTHING MOISTURIZING SPRAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it did the (near) impossible.  It stopped my new array of bug bites from itching me to distraction.  It calmed sown an erupting hive.  It allowed me to stop thinking about itching for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that the spray might stain clothing, but it did nor appear to do that.  My only complaint would be that the spray is hard to manipulate and aim, especially with arthritic hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know... I will find a way around that because IT STOPPED MY ITCHING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(And that&#x27;s a good thing.)</li>
    <li> I tend to have very dry skin that can become quite itchy at times, particularly on my back where it can be hard to reach. I will develop large dry patches, and the itching is horrible. And sometimes, I don&#x27;t conveniently have someone around to rub lotion into my back when it needs it worst. It can be supremely irritating. So when I saw this spray lotion from Curel, I was curious to see if it could really help solve this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good news. It does help stop itching, and the lotion itself feels nice and isn&#x27;t heavily scented. It is a thinner lotion, not thick like a creme (otherwise, I doubt it would spray).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However - the spray nozzle clogs very easily, and then instead of a nice, even spray, you get a stream that flies everywhere. I just had to wipe of the door...and the door frame...and even the next door over. It&#x27;s easy to clean, but it&#x27;s something that you&#x27;ll have to do every time you use it. Plus, while the lotion is quite light, it still just sits on the skin. Rubbing in is needed, which sort of defeats the purpose of a spray to me. If I&#x27;m going to rub lotion in, then I could just use regular lotion and go from there. If I were to use this on my back, without having it rubbed in, it would get all over everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - six of one, half-dozen of the other. It does what it says it will, but not without hiccups. I will probably use it until it&#x27;s gone, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it after that.</li>
    <li> It just so happened I have poison ivy for the first time in my life.  All on my ams, hands and legs--it&#x27;s horrible.  I used this at night on my back.  It&#x27;s very cool so be aware of that.  When my husband sprayed it on my back, I jumped because it was that cooling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stopped the itching after a few minutes but I noticed it dried sticky.  Honestly though, I was relieved that I wasn&#x27;t scratching that I didn&#x27;t care.  There&#x27;s not much of a scent so it didn&#x27;t mess with my allergies.  The nozzle sprays fast and narrow so you can point it directly on an itchy spot.  I wish there was a setting where you can get more of a wider application.</li>
    <li> Awesome solution for summertime allergies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are anything like me and love to run around in flip flops, shorts and a t-shirt then you know all too well how horrible the summer can be for our skin with all the sunscreen, allergies and bites we can face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray instantly soothes any of my daily irritation (From allergies or Just my dry skin!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fantastic product that works well and is in a very convenient spray can. I&#x27;ll add this to my weekly shopping list it&#x27;s so great!</li>
    <li> Curel itch defense is cooling and stops the itch. Then it leaves what feels like a protective moisture sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curel has a delicate floral scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has ceramides.  Curel’s website states that dry irritated skin often lacks ceramides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m going to hoard this until winter when my skin gets dry and itchy. If I run out I will get more, because this stuff works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem with this 6oz Curel spray is the delivery system. Depressing the top to release the spray is difficult.</li>
    <li> This has been a lifesaver for us, because despite sunscreen, this summer we&#x27;ve been getting a little too much sun.  Maybe my sunscreen got old from last summer, but I&#x27;m shocked at how much we all had dry skin after playing at the local pool a few days.  Maybe it&#x27;s the chlorine, but either way, this felt really good on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the dry and flaky skin, I have old lady skin with mosquito bites too: my arms are a mess and this is very soothing. I like the spray on feature, and I tried to make it leak and it didn&#x27;t.  The thing to know is that even though you spray it on, you still have to blend it in with your hands. For some reason, (old lady again), I thought that I could spray it on my back and be done with it. Nope, still needed to contort like an acrobat to blend it into my skin.  I&#x27;m using it night and morning and it feels like it&#x27;s lasting all day. Not quite like a body butter would (Nivea makes the best body cream in a blue tin), but suitable for when you don&#x27;t have an hour to blend in a heavy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in the morning I didn&#x27;t have to wait long to dress after putting it on.  I wore a silk blouse and had no color effects.  I say that because once I did have a moisturizer react in some weird way with a silk blouse and the sleeves were ruined by little weird water marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is how long this will last. I suspect it will not last as long as I&#x27;d like, so I&#x27;ll update the review when it&#x27;s out and tell you how many days of morning and night usage worked out to being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m pleased and Curel is a good brand, not one that I&#x27;ve had trouble with breakouts before (even old ladies get acne from heavy stuff).  Again, will update if that changes.</li>
    <li> This is a surprisingly good product.  I live in a desert and it has very low humidity most of the year.  My skin on my arms and legs and feet tends to get very dry and thus itch, especially in the middle of the night which can be quite annoying.  I tried this product when I received it and sprayed my skin prior to bedtime, and NO MORE ITCHING... it is great.  On top of that, it really conditions the skin and I really love this product.  Super highly recommend</li>
    <li> This time of year my skin gets dry and itchy, especially after shaving.  That leads to scratching, which is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is cooling and provides a nice relief, although the anti-itching effect doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.  The citrus smell is very faint and goes away even more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used spray lotion before, it works in much the same way.  It&#x27;s very easy to get this lotion spread over a large area, although it takes a little while to soak in.</li>
    <li> I know this is for itchy dry skin and it was soothing to that, but the same evening we tried it on the itchy skin, my daughter got 5 mosquito bites on her arm. We put it on them and she said it helped. So bonus! The spray is thicker than you give it credit for initially, so at first, it is easy to spray on too much, but other than that - just praise for this product.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my sister because she suffers with multiple allergies and is unable to use any products that are scented. She said this product actually works. You spray it on you after a shower.</li>
    <li> Not a good sign when the cap breaks on first use and the jagged edge cuts your finger. Like many spray lotions, this can has a twist locking cap to keep it from spraying accidentally. When we turned to use it for the first time, the cap cracked, jabbed me in the thumb and wouldn&#x27;t work after that. I ended up removing the cap and the broken half and got it to work again. After all that, it&#x27;s really no more than lotion in a spray can just like with suntan lotions. Packaging aside, the lotion does a reasonably good job easing an itch but would be just as good in a squeeze bottle.</li>
    <li> This is great. Not sticky at all and sprays well. Often times my skin feels dry and I like to slather on lotion, this WI be on my refill list</li>
    <li> While I like the ease of using a spray moisturizer, I was not very fond of this product. It does work, with a light-weight spray that is very soothing on the skin. The spray is very helpful for painful, itchy sunburn since it needs minimal touching of the skin. What I really did not like was the smell. It has a medicinal smell that I found very unpleasant. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell, this is a wonderful product</li>
    <li> Hey, this stuff really works. I have several different skin conditions going on and tend to be quite sensitive to creams and ointments. I love how this one easily sprays out of the can; just twist the top to unlock, then depress the sprayer. A little goes a long way and I use it sparingly, which also helps avoid any possible adverse reactions. it does indeed take the edge off my itching and feels very soothing, without being heavy or greasy. I also like that it appears to be essentially odorless. I can&#x27;t make out any perfumes or overbearing scents, making it ideal for men and women, no matter what your favorite fragrance is. I&#x27;m hooked and would definitely buy this again when I run out. This should last a good while, making it economical too. Nice.</li>
    <li> Update 10/28/2015: I was bitten up by fleas and the itching was driving me so crazy I couldn&#x27;t even sleep. Nothing I tried stopped the itching. I found the Curel in our medicine cabinet and sprayed it on my bitten up ankles and legs, and it brought me such immediate and complete relief. And the sprayer didn&#x27;t even act up on me this time. While the sprayer could be improved, I&#x27;m so happy to find relief that I&#x27;m upgrading my review to 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;-----------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Curel Itch Soothing Moisturizing Spray claims that with use over time it replenishes ceramides on the skin and will prevent itchy symptoms from reoccurring. It has the National Eczema Association Seal of Acceptance. I can&#x27;t say if it works as claimed in the long term. But I sure would have given this a try on my son&#x27;s knees and other areas when he was young, as I watched him suffer terribly from chronic eczema and always looked for solutions to make him comfortable beyond using cortisone cream. I went so far as to order sorbolene cream from Australia (14 years ago it was not available in the USA) paying crazy shipping fees looking for something to give my son relief. Luckily, he outgrew his eczema, so I can&#x27;t test it on eczema to see if it helps. But it&#x27;s not a moisturizer that&#x27;s limited to being used for eczema, and in spraying it on myself I can definitely say it feels cool and soothing, and it stopped the itchiness caused by a patch of itchy bumps on my chest that were probably caused by the hot weather. I also find it soothing on my itchy dry legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer has acted up on me- one time it even jammed so that Curel was foaming out all over and by the time I got it to stop I had about 10x the amount I needed and ended up rubbing it all over my arms and legs. Another time the sprayer functioned properly, but still left the carpeted floor feeling damp so obviously some is getting lost into the atmosphere and settling on the floor. Also, Curel smells medicinal to me like menthol and eucalyptus (which are listed as ingredients), though the scent dissipates quickly. The bottom line for me is that Curel is cooling and soothing and can reduce itching, and I will use it for heat rash, sunburn, bug bites, etc. I also would try it in a heartbeat to relieve eczema on my son if he still had it since relief from severe eczema is hard to find. But I don&#x27;t like the smell or spray bottle enough for me to use it as part of my regular routine for my skin even though it gets dry and itchy, and I prefer to stick to using gobs of Vanicream. The sprayer is annoying and needs improvement, but the product is good enough that I would recommend trying it for eczema relief and relief for other itchy or painful skin conditions like rash, hives, sunburn, etc.are listed as ingredients), though the scent dissipates quickly.

    <li> I really like the Curel brand. This spray goes on light and cool feeling and has a slight citrus scent.  I guess I don&#x27;t see the benefit of the spray on application versus regular lotion, since I found I still had to rub it in using my hands.  I also thought the twist lid was a little confusing and hard to spray accurately.</li>
    <li> Curel is an excellent moisturizer, highly recommended by our family dermatologist. That being said, I can&#x27;t figure out what the advantage is of putting lotion in a spray bottle (except that companies have to keep dreaming up new ways to part us from our money.) The spray bottle works OK, but you still have to rub the thinned out moisturizer into your skin. This isn&#x27;t a &#x27;spray and go&#x27; operation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like regular Curel, the moisturizer works fine. I&#x27;m just not convinced that the price for such a small bottle is worth whatever benefit this is supposed to give via a spray. Buy Curel; save yourself the novelty and stick with the lotion in the bottle instead.</li>
    <li> I tried this anti-itch soothing cream on both a sunburn that was several days old, some itchy dry skin, and a few bug bites and it worked well in all three cases :) It soothed the skin, moisturized, and stopped the itch. My only complaint is that there weren&#x27;t directions on the bottle for how to open it or dispense the product. Turns out it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. Just spin the cap until the hole in the cap lines up with the hole underneath and then you can depress the cap to spray the lotion on. I&#x27;m embarrassed to say that it took me more than a few minutes to figure that out. The product is great and the packaging is fine but a line or two of how to open and use the spray canister would have been helpful in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as its counterpart, Curely Itch Defense Lotion, in that it soothes and eventually calms the need to itch. For a product line that is not overly expensive, this latest addition is another sure winner, with the added plus that now it can be used via spray. The size of the container is not very big, but the very convenient way in which it can be used makes it a standout. Have no reason to believe that this method of using the product is less effective than the lotion version, as I have already have experienced the efficient way in which it helps against itching. Would like to thank Amazon, for delivering this Curel Itch Defense Soothing Moisturizing Spray, 6 Ounce, right to my doorsteps.&lt;br /&gt;For someone who regrettably always seemed to have a tendency for dry skin, I find this product immensely helpful to combat this problem on a daily basis. Yes, perhaps a little more expensive in the long run, but also much easier and as equally effective, in this spray bottle. 4.5 Stars.</li>
    <li> Curel&#x27;s itch defense soothing moisturizing spray goes on fast, absorbs quickly and cools skin that is dry and flakey, with no oily filmy after feel.  My husband has dry skin and the Curel has made a difference in the look and feel of his arms.  There isn&#x27;t a heavy smell.  The can is easy to hold, even with wet/ damp hands,  thanks to its shape.  Overall, I like the product, and recommend it without any apprehension!</li>
    <li> Where has this spray been my whole life? Curel Itch Defense Soothing Moisturizing Spray is the best thing that has happened to me this summer. Ok, that may be a little dramatic but it has definitley made my life easier. For some reason, my daughter and I are mosquito magnets. All summer long, we suffer. No matter what repelent we use, we get bit. And we itch all summer long! This spray offered us immediate relief! I literally hear my daughter sigh in relief when she uses it. In fact, I&#x27;m ordering another two bottles. My nephew was also scratching like crazy at some bites and when we applied it to him, he immediately felt better.  I also encountered some shaving rash on my legs and this stuff worked like magic! I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a spray lotion -- and I liked it. It sprayed fairly evenly; evenly enough that I wasn&#x27;t annoyed with clumps and drips. The initial burst left more lotion than at the end of the &#x27;sweep&#x27; down my arm or leg, but the cream spread easily enough that I thought &#x27;fairly evenly&#x27; was accurate and fair. The lotion also absorbed quickly into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling. It was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of this moisturizer is the SMELL. Yum! A very light citrus/orange smell. Very refreshing, uplifting, and soothing at the same time! I prefer fruity scents over floral, so this was a definite plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being summer, I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with itchy skin. But as winter arrives, I get very itchy hands and arms, and I am looking forward to using this lotion. I can tell that the smell will also be a nice fresh change in the cold, dark days of winter.</li>
    <li> Wow this stuff really works at relieving my dry and itchy legs.  I&#x27;m prone to this problem especially after I shave my legs but just a quick spray of this creamy lotion and I get instant cooling relief.  I recommend.</li>
</ol>
