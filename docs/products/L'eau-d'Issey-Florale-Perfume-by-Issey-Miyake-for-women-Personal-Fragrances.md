      <li>It is so cute.</li>
      <li>Most edp&#x27;s are gone on me within two hours</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so, so lovely.</li>
      <li>, more show-stopping blooms that, in the process, they&#x27;ve all but bred the fragrance out of roses - to the point that we no longer recognize the scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the scent, just bought the eau de toilette.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly pleased with this item, it came with a bonus purse sampler.</li>
      <li>As advertised and so much better price than in a store</li>
      <li>AND this is coming from a man married to her for almost 20 years!!!</li>
      <li>I love that it is so floral without being too strong.</li>
      <li>I am using the product now for more than 15 years; Wonderful fresh fragrance and is receiving many compliments from various people.</li>
      <li>I got this for my wife, was expecting the perfume only, instead got a gift set with roller and hands lotion, very pleased to get the extras, my wife loved the fragance</li>
      <li>This is a beautiful rose, mandarin and musk scent, perfectly balanced and pretty long lasting considering it is an EDT spray.</li>
      <li>I and hubby like the original much better though.  </li>
      <li>Issey Miyake is my favorite scent (Leau D&#x27;Issey original) and my daughter loves this one.  </li>
      <li>Nice, light, fresh floral scent.</li>
      <li>Refreshing and exhilarating not heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>Nice cologne, light and pretty.  </li>
      <li>I used this perfume so many years, I am pretty sure that the perfuem you send me is fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;god</li>
      <li>I am kissed no wonder it was so cheap they could have just told me</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and florale.</li>
      <li>many a times - confirming that this perfume is as good as it looks from outside...</li>
      <li>Plus as an extra, they also included a very nice purse size spray bottle.  </li>
      <li>This is my first Issey perfume, and I am in love with it.</li>
      <li>I kept thinking there was something vaguely familiar about the scent but couldn&#x27;t place it.</li>
      <li>it´s fresh and sweet, and not too strong.</li>
      <li>Went to Ulta looking for the perfect subtle foral for summer and this was on display.</li>
      <li>but they&#x27;re my go-to site for educating myself about my favorite fragrances (i.e., What are the top, middle, and bottom notes?</li>
      <li>I received it quickly after ordering and it also came with a purse sized spray along with it.</li>
      <li>It smells so awesome and last long.</li>
      <li>This perfume is light, flowerly and very feminine.</li>
      <li>I have been wearing issey Myake for years, the florale is much lighter, spring light floral scent.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
      <li>And the scent is incredibly sexy, subtle, and erotic.</li>
      <li>And I was right.</li>
      <li>We are in our late twenties, but I kind of feel like it is a more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Very much a signature fragrance.</li>
      <li>(He&#x27;ll appreciate you SO much!)</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>This cologne has a soft and light smell.  </li>
      <li>Try it out at the perfume counter at your local fine department store.</li>
      <li>Also, Ulta charged as much for the 1.6oz as Amazon charges for the 3oz, which I&#x27;ve already used plenty of.</li>
      <li>the cost is so much cheaper than at the two stores I just mentioned also.  </li>
      <li>Their message boards are really helpful, also.</li>
      <li>Really likes that</li>
      <li>Really like the smell.</li>
      <li>She really likes this fragrance too (smells just like the name suggests--flowers).</li>
      <li>This one is soft smell of fresh florals.  </li>
      <li>and I really like it too.  </li>
      <li>Completely unexpected!!!</li>
      <li>The product was amazing, it was a sorprise when I receive a give set, whit a small perfume and a hydratant.</li>
      <li>If perfume does NOT die quickly on you, however, you should definitely give this one a try.</li>
      <li>The only drawback for some might be that the scent is not strong enough, but I love that it&#x27;s so light and not overpowering at all.</li>
      <li>and I ask AMAZON the replace the new one for me</li>
      <li>Wow -</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really comment on actual smell of product as I never used</li>
      <li>My wife just fell in love with this fragrance after our granddaughter gave it to her for Christmas a few years back.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s not even a good fake.</li>
      <li>; How sad is it that rose breeders have focused so much on breeding bigger</li>
      <li>arrived early and has an extra sample as a gift.</li>
      <li>Arrival was timely and fast coming from a foreign country.</li>
      <li>so I had little hope the edt would last more than a half hour.</li>
      <li>I WOULD have spent the extra money for the real one.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The scent is very light and not overpowering. I love that it is so floral without being too strong. The shipping was great -- I ordered it on a Friday evening, and it was at my door on Tuesday afternoon!! I&#x27;m very impressed with this vendor.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s light and florale. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it for myself. I received it quickly after ordering and it also came with a purse sized spray along with it.</li>
    <li> I chose this Eau De Toilette Spray because my wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item arrived early and has an extra sample as a gift.</li>
    <li> Great price and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> This perfume is THICK with the scent if Springtime and flowers. But remember, it is a casual fragrace that not everyone can wear. Try it out at the perfume counter at your local fine department store. Ask others if the scent is complementary before you buy and wear it.</li>
    <li> Issey Miyake is my favorite scent (Leau D&#x27;Issey original) and my daughter loves this one.  I would recommend Issey to anyone.</li>
    <li> This perfume is light, flowerly and very feminine. I had been looking to replace my Ann Taylor possibilities and this is the perfect alternative! I have been stopped and asked what I was wearing many a times - confirming that this perfume is as good as it looks from outside...</li>
    <li> It smells so awesome and last long. I like the bottle as well. It is so cute. This is my favorite now. I suggest you too.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, just bought the eau de toilette. Woud have given it 5 stars but heavy on the alcohol so burns a bit going on. And scent doesn&#x27;t stay as long as cologne or perfume; pretty expensive forwhatyou get!</li>
    <li> Great smelling stuff.  My wife loves it.</li>
    <li> Went to Ulta looking for the perfect subtle foral for summer and this was on display. I spritzed it and knew it was the fragrance I&#x27;d be walking out with. The sad thing? I kept thinking there was something vaguely familiar about the scent but couldn&#x27;t place it. After some time in the store I suddenly stopped and thought &amp;#34;ROSES.&amp;#34; How sad is it that rose breeders have focused so much on breeding bigger, more show-stopping blooms that, in the process, they&#x27;ve all but bred the fragrance out of roses - to the point that we no longer recognize the scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, it&#x27;s here and it&#x27;s so, so lovely. I was, however, tremendously disappointed when I went to purchase and found it only came in edt form. Most edp&#x27;s are gone on me within two hours so I had little hope the edt would last more than a half hour. And I was right. Also, Ulta charged as much for the 1.6oz as Amazon charges for the 3oz, which I&#x27;ve already used plenty of. A fiscal error in judgement I&#x27;ll never make again. At this rate I should finish this bottle in two weeks, after which point I will not buy another until Miyake at least markets a spray edp. And if they give me a parfum? Oh, $&amp;##, I&#x27;ll be all over that #€&amp;#60;/!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this were (at least) an edp it would get FIVE STARS from me. If perfume does NOT die quickly on you, however, you should definitely give this one a try. I&#x27;m so addicted I can&#x27;t leave it alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, I see people are asking about the ingredients in this edt. I can&#x27;t recommend Fragrantica.com enough. They don&#x27;t sell anything but they&#x27;re my go-to site for educating myself about my favorite fragrances (i.e., What are the top, middle, and bottom notes? Who is The Nose behind this fragrance - and what else did they create?, etc...). Their message boards are really helpful, also.</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume EVER! I get complimented on it all of the time.&lt;br /&gt;This rose version is really nice.</li>
    <li> I got perfume a week ago&lt;br /&gt;it is fake!!! I used this perfume so many years, I am pretty sure that the perfuem you send me is fake!!!&lt;br /&gt;god damns you</li>
    <li> Bought this for a gift as it was requested by the recipient. She wears it all the time and loves it. I can&#x27;t really comment on actual smell of product as I never used</li>
    <li> but the perfume flow out half of the bottle and wet the outer packing even the outer plastic film, It delays my gift and I ask AMAZON the replace the new one for me asap. Waiting for Amazon reply!</li>
    <li> I am using the product now for more than 15 years; Wonderful fresh fragrance and is receiving many compliments from various people.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, but it secretly double-purposed as a gift for me! I love when she wears it! She really likes this fragrance too (smells just like the name suggests--flowers). We are in our late twenties, but I kind of feel like it is a more &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; fragrance. Fellas, get this for the lady you love. Ladies, get this for your guy! (He&#x27;ll appreciate you SO much!)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  Hard to find at the department stores, Dillard&#x27;s and Macy&#x27;s.  the cost is so much cheaper than at the two stores I just mentioned also.  I have already ordered an additional bottle.  Plus as an extra, they also included a very nice purse size spray bottle.  Completely unexpected!!!</li>
    <li> I got this for my wife, was expecting the perfume only, instead got a gift set with roller and hands lotion, very pleased to get the extras, my wife loved the fragance and I really like it too.  She gets compliments all the time for the nice fragrance!</li>
    <li> Wow - I have been wearing issey Myake for years, the florale is much lighter, spring light floral scent. Get complements daily</li>
    <li> The product did not come with the specifications described in the publication. Buy colony 3.0 oz and I delivered a 1.7 oz</li>
    <li> Arrival was timely and fast coming from a foreign country. The price was amazing! The package was wrapped nicely and I would order again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Nice, light, fresh floral scent. More suitable for use during the day.</li>
    <li> Valentine´s Gift for my wife. She wears it at least 3 times a week. Really likes that it´s fresh and sweet, and not too strong.</li>
    <li> I already have 3 other perfumes from Issey Miyake that I bought here.  This one is soft smell of fresh florals.  The price is the best here.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly pleased with this item, it came with a bonus purse sampler. Although the perfume didn&#x27;t come in 2 days it came in 3 and with a gift so I was happy!</li>
    <li> I am so upset I was looking forward to this one of my Fav scents by issey but it&#x27;s a knock off I am kissed no wonder it was so cheap they could have just told me I WOULD have spent the extra money for the real one. And it&#x27;s not even a good fake. Please don&#x27;t waste your time..</li>
    <li> If you like floral scents, this one is the ultimate.  It is light, but distinctive and unforgettable.  So many people have commented on how lovely it smells.  It is romantic and nostalgic, but not old-fashioned at all.  Very much a signature fragrance.</li>
    <li> Great summer fragrance....lots of compliments! Definitely worth the money. Refreshing and exhilarating not heavy at all.  Would work for any time of day or night.</li>
    <li> One of my wives favorites and she has a lot of them</li>
    <li> Nice cologne, light and pretty.  I and hubby like the original much better though.  I will use it up but not buy more.</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compliments about how good I smelled when wearing this fragrance. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful rose, mandarin and musk scent, perfectly balanced and pretty long lasting considering it is an EDT spray. Love, love, love it! You will not be disappointed; a nice addition for any Issey Miyake lover. I must add that I don&#x27;t typically like florals, but this one is a keeper!</li>
    <li> Really like the smell. Exactly what I was looking for. However smell doesn&#x27;t last. Perhaps that&#x27;s it&#x27;s the lightness of it.</li>
    <li> This cologne has a soft and light smell.  After I put it on, I no longer smell it; but, when I arrive to someone&#x27;s home and give them a hug - wow!  &amp;#34;You smell so great!  What are you wearing?!&amp;#34;  I get that over and over again!  I absolutely love this cologne!</li>
    <li> good day,&lt;br /&gt;not comment on the package that brings the cream and hand soap was a good surprise.&lt;br /&gt; tank&#x27;s you</li>
    <li> This is my first Issey perfume, and I am in love with it. When I first smelled it at the store, I wasn&#x27;t too crazy about it, but it quickly grew on me. This perfume makes me feel like a princess every time I wear it. The only drawback for some might be that the scent is not strong enough, but I love that it&#x27;s so light and not overpowering at all. Side note: it&#x27;s an eau de toilette, not a perfume.</li>
    <li> Amazing fragrance I wear this to formal events</li>
    <li> The product was amazing, it was a sorprise when I receive a give set, whit a small perfume and a hydratant. Love you guys!</li>
    <li> Product was strickly scented alcohol. Dissapated within five minutes.</li>
    <li> As advertised and so much better price than in a store</li>
    <li> Producto en excelente estado, lo recomiendo amplia mente, yo vivo en Venezuela y el producto me llego en muy buen estado</li>
    <li> My wife just fell in love with this fragrance after our granddaughter gave it to her for Christmas a few years back. Price is the best I could find on the web. And the scent is incredibly sexy, subtle, and erotic. AND this is coming from a man married to her for almost 20 years!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume is so light and perfect for summer. I get a ton of compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> love the smell of this perfume! I just wish they made a parfum and not a toilette spray. exceeded my expectations</li>
</ol>
