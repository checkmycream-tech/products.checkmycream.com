      <li>It does nothing to reduce the look of fine lines.</li>
      <li>I was at Smashbox outlet store, asked the lady to help me select an under eye primer since I started to notice fine lines and my concealer was settling in them.</li>

      <li>Might make the consealer stay put but also got new consealer that is not Smashbox</li>
      <li>I still prefer to use plain old vitamin E instead of a primer before applying the concealer and it works much better.</li>
      <li>This is not a magical cream, but it does brighten up my hideous reminders that I&#x27;m not in my 20s any more.</li>
      <li>I received many compliments on my eyes, despite my crying!  </li>
      <li>so I stay looking young, even at age 47.</li>
      <li>When I put it on I can barely tell any difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted to love this primer. Frankly, it sucks. It does nothing to reduce the look of fine lines. They hydration is just not even there. If you compare Smashbox&#x27;s hydrating primer (the blue one) to this, it&#x27;s not even close. The other Smashbox primer works better and hydrates better. All in all for te under eye area I find I get the best results with my Dermalogica primer... and there&#x27;s load more of it.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product but not the best out there either. I was at Smashbox outlet store, asked the lady to help me select an under eye primer since I started to notice fine lines and my concealer was settling in them. So she started to praise this product. I bought a whole spanking 4 of them! Well..After using for 2 weeks I did not honestly see the results I was expecting. Yes it doe hydrate to a point but it does not fill in my fine lines and my concealer still settles in them. I was expecting better results for the price I paid, but oh well, it was worth trying. I still prefer to use plain old vitamin E instead of a primer before applying the concealer and it works much better.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve ever used! As long as you use undereye moisturizer before applying. My undereye concealer no longer creates creases. This is a great product. And I am a true product junkie! Love this stuff. You cannot best Smashbox Cosmetics!</li>
    <li> This does smoothe the under eye area but not the staying power I hoped for,  I add another product with this and then it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I thought this item was going to be the answer to my puff eyes! I heard all the hoopla and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t deliver. When I put it on I can barely tell any difference. I will not be buying it again so my quest continues.</li>
    <li> Where has this product been my entire life?  I found the product by chance on YouTube and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot!  It MORE than met my expectations!  Even wore it during my MIL&#x27;s funeral, which was one of the hardest days of my life.  It held up through tears and Kleenex and nose issues.  I received many compliments on my eyes, despite my crying!  Amazing product!  Amazing results!  You need to try this product at least once in your life. Today is the best day to try it!!!</li>
    <li> What a difference a little product can make.  This is better then expected.  Thank you for your fast shipping.  I would recommend this compant.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with Smashbox products.</li>
    <li> Bought a sample pack of the smashbox primers...this did absolutely nothing beyond moisturize. Concealer settled into lines the moment I put it on, and it didn&#x27;t help my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Not like the one I bought from the department store.</li>
    <li> great product that keeps under eye makeup stay in place all day</li>
    <li> I like this eye primer very much for it seems to smooth out any lines around my eyes.  It makes it so much easier to apply eye make up to my 60 plus eyes.  You only need a tiny amount and it works wonders, I think.</li>
    <li> This is alright. I expected much more out of this product. I used it a few times and it just sits in my bag now. Has a minty like smell to it</li>
    <li> Got this to add to my Smashbox primer which I love.  Cannot see that it does anything after two months.  Might make the consealer stay put but also got new consealer that is not Smashbox and I love it.</li>
    <li> This is not a magical cream, but it does brighten up my hideous reminders that I&#x27;m not in my 20s any more. If you have the cash to spend, I say go for it. I will say that I think it&#x27;s geared towards lighter skin (which worked out for me since I am pale), but may look a little odd on darker complexions.</li>
    <li> Love this undereye primer. Almost instantly smooths out undereye lines. Great finish for applying undereye concealer. I have been searching for an undereye product that lives up to its claims and this one does!  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I have long lower lashes and my mascara always ends up leaving shadowy residue under my eyes where the lashes rub.  I used this product--followed by my usual mineral powder foundation--and voila! no more smudging.  It stays put and doesn&#x27;t crease in the wrinkles under my eyes.  I even put moisturizer underneath this product, and it still stays put and doesn&#x27;t crease or smear.</li>
    <li> I have used this befor and loved it, it It hydrating formula feels  weightless and fast absorbing&lt;br /&gt;and help with puffiness, and dark circles. love it</li>
    <li> Very happy with the price and shipper.</li>
    <li> I love how it brightens around my eyes and keeps my mineral powder on.  I put it on and wait a minute for it to dry before I put on the Bare Minerals Prime Time primer on the rest of my face.  Then I apply the mineral powder.  This eye primer stops the powder from collecting in my wrinkles so I stay looking young, even at age 47.</li>
