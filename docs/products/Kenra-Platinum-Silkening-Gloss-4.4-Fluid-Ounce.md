<li> This one by far has surpassed all of the previous ones.  </li>
<li> Hard to find in the salons where I am at, but can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>

<li> and  I apply it when my hair is wet,</li>

<li> Even on long thick hair it repels humid frizz monster too.</li>
<li> The bottle leaked a little of the product, I wrote them just to let them know.</li>
<li> However this recent bottle seems to have a broken pump.</li>
<li> No more frizzies.</li>
<li> I LOVE this sickening gloss!</li>
<li> I use it everyday!</li>
<li> Style your hair as usual and then squirt a nickel sized amount in your hands, rub together and run them through your hair.</li>
<li> I apply this Gloss at Least twice to my scalp, allowing 1 day before relaxer is aapplied, No Burning or Stining of scalp during treatment.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot on hair products either, but this is a must!</li>
<li> I merely wanted to let them know about the packaging.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this gloss</li>

    <li> A gift for my Granddaughter, she has used this for awhile and loves it. She was surprised to receive it in this larger size.</li>
    <li> this stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> I got the first bottle from a friend and my husband used it w/o telling me so we ran out and I panicked. the smell is amazing and i can use this in my hair straight or curly (AVOID ROOTS)</li>
    <li> I work some in right after my morning shower and my hair is soft and smooth all day long, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.</li>
    <li> Takes the dry look out of your hair. Good quality product. Use in hot curling my hair...I use on dry not wet hair.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Great and fast shipping.  Would buy again.  Good price.  I had bought this product in a smaller size at JCPenney and loved it.  My hair is corse and curly and I use a flatting iron on it.  This product leaves it shiny and healthy looking.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on my hair when I use this product.  Will be buying more as soon as I run out,</li>
    <li> I love this product!  One small pump goes a long way. I have very coarse ends and this helps it to calm it down.  The smell is also very good. It makes my hair look shiny and very silky after applying any sort of heat.  I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I purchased after my cousin let me use some of hers. I have very curly frizzy hair and  I apply it when my hair is wet, when I dry it, my hair is less frizzy. Then I flat iron it and my hair is like glass! I love this stuff! It won&#x27;t work miracles without drying and flat ironing but if you are already doing this, it will make a world of difference in your hair. The vendor I purchased from was FANTASTIC! The bottle leaked a little of the product, I wrote them just to let them know. I did not want to return nor did I expect a refund. I merely wanted to let them know about the packaging. They sent me another bottle at no charge. Who says customer service doesn&#x27;t exist. They were AWESOME!</li>
    <li> This is awesome for your hair. You use less than a quarter size amount and you get great shine and no frizz. Best if used on your hair if it&#x27;s damp then blow dry &amp; style. You can just use this for touch ups too.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it for several years now. However this recent bottle seems to have a broken pump. Can still use it but I have a feel when the bottle isn&#x27;t full I&#x27;ll need a new pump. Other than that it&#x27;s great and the smell is awesome!</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the salons where I am at, but can&#x27;t live without this product!</li>
    <li> Best hair product I have ever used to tame down the frizziness in my super curly hair. Style your hair as usual and then squirt a nickel sized amount in your hands, rub together and run them through your hair. No more frizzies. Might be a bit heavy for straight hair, but for us curly girls it is fantastic.  Also smells great.</li>
    <li> Super happy! Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product!  It was just not what I was looking for. I was looking for just shine. This product is like one I have already. It is good to put on after a blowout. I wanted something to put on after the hair spray.</li>
    <li> Wow! My hair has never been so silky.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair. I ordered this because it smelled delicious and made my hair shine. Not disappointed. I will order this again.</li>

    <li> I have used many different silkeners/heat protector serums.  This one by far has surpassed all of the previous ones.  Will be purchasing more soon.</li>
    <li> I buy the bigger size, the 4.4 fl oz because I&#x27;m happy with this product. This is the last thing I use on my hair when I&#x27;m finished straightening it. I described all the steps in my review of the tresemme keratin smooth flat iron spray on this site. And I don&#x27;t use a lot of it per use since a little goes a long way &amp; I always use it or else I feel like I&#x27;ve missed something.</li>
    <li> It is a great product. I would have gave it 5 stars if the cap was not broken and the product was not oozing out when I received it in the mail.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product.  Smells like strawberries, but not too overpowering.  I use it on the ends of my damp hair every time I blow dry my hair or if I have any fly-aways I use a couple pumps of the product to tone it down.  It is not overly greasy either and I have also used it on my skin.  It makes your skin very soft.</li>
    <li> My hairstylist used this on me and I loved it so much I bought it at the salon. Then found it on here and bought here ever since. I LOVE this sickening gloss! I don&#x27;t usually spend a lot on hair products either, but this is a must! Works great to calm frizz and smells delish! I strongly recommend! ;)  5/5 stars</li>
    <li> I just love this stuff, and it smells great!</li>
    <li> Both daughters swear by this product!!</li>
    <li> Repairs and shines like nothing I have used. And the smell....yummy. Even on long thick hair it repels humid frizz monster too.</li>
