<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Terrific product--works great!  Since it ships from China the estimated time of arrival was about 1 month but it arrived much sooner than that.  I was  very pleased about that.</li>
    <li> I find I have to go over the same spot several times to see results I am looking for.</li>
    <li> Great product, gift to sister, who loved it. Substantial, does the job well.</li>
    <li> Item received in a timely manner and performs exactly as described. Great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Am really liking this so far. Hope it remains durable, only had ito a little while.</li>
    <li> Love this! It works great at removing dead skin from my heels!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I bought this product. It charges easily and holds a charge well. It appears to be well made and it performs as advertised. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works great!  Meets all our expectations.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product does not work.  The roller stops rotating as soon as it touches the skin, whether or not any pressure is applied.  The motor is simply not powerful enough.  I read the reviews for several of these devices on Amazon before making the decision to purchase this one, and I was duped by the many positive reviews.</li>
    <li> This product does a great job.</li>
    <li> I bought a second one as a gift after I bought the one for me.  It&#x27;s amazing how efficient this is, but be careful because you can file off too much skin and then your toes will hurt until they heal.</li>
    <li> Well worth the price. Very pleased at what it can do. Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s work okay for me!</li>
    <li> Works great, super value.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my wife. She loves it!</li>
    <li> It works amazingly. It took all of the dead skin off my feet.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it the price was a lot better than outhers works ,just as good ,plus rechargeable !! Best bang for the buck ! :)</li>
    <li> I thought it was weird that this item came in a baggie.  it works not as good as going to the salon but better than those files you buy the grocery store.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes this machine. It works great. We received this product before the date it said it would ship. Would definitely order from this seller again.*****</li>
    <li> Works great, it takes a little longer to get a smooth feel.</li>
    <li> worked great on Thursday. did not work on Friday.Now it is a tiny flashlight. Not what my heels need to keep them smooth!&lt;br /&gt;How do I get a new one?</li>
    <li> !bought item as a gift for my wife. she loves it!</li>
    <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll admit it. In the summer I wear cutouts so my feet always look nice. I go to the mani/pedi every week in the summer but once mid-September hits all bets are off unless I have a boyfriend, then I keep up the routine. Being that I&#x27;m single right now, I&#x27;ve been like whatever. I&#x27;ll lotion my feet every night after my shower and pedi-egg them once a month but that&#x27;s all. My feet stay tucked in wool socks and boots all winter, no one is seeing them. But this winter has been very harsh up here and I noticed that they were in rough shape so I pulled out the pedi-egg only to find that the blade was dull. I bought more blades but they were all crap as were the ones in the second box. I wasn&#x27;t spending ten bucks for another box of duds. I saw the commercial for the amoepe(I think that&#x27;s spelled right) and looked on here for it. I saw one for 36 bucks and was like no. I looked around and saw this one. I read the reviews and decided to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting it charge last night I used it this morning. Honestly, it took me an hour(thirty minutes per foot) and when I was done I screeched. It was just like going to get my feet done without paying the forty bucks for a mani/pedi. I am elated with this thing and am thinking of ordering a second one as a gift for my sister. It&#x27;s excellent!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing though, this thing is very powerful so please, please do not keep it in one spot for an extended period of time. Move it around, even if you&#x27;re distracted by a text. That was my mistake and I now have a small sore spot on my heel. But that is one hundred percent my fault. Other than that, this is an excellent buy!</li>
    <li> Wow, this is the second best item that I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon, ever!  I used this callus remover on my dry feet for about ten minutes. Within minutes of using this product my feet look better than they ever have. I&#x27;ve been to spas where my pedicures lasted a full hour and my feet were not as smooth as they are with this device!  Another thing I like about it is that it sands your feet no cutting. If you use a razor it grows back much worse. ;-) I have never been more impressed with a product and the price is affordable and fair.</li>
    <li> My son ordered this for me for Mother&#x27;s Day. It doesn&#x27;t work at all. It does not charge- the charge light doesn&#x27;t light up. I&#x27;ve had it plugged in and it&#x27;s dead as a door nail.</li>
    <li> Love it! much cheaper than the Amoepi and its re chargeable the other brand uses batteries. This is a win win!</li>
    <li> It works like it says. Needs more info where to order extra heads for it</li>
    <li> Weak motor! Barely does the job. I had to moisten my feet and it still barely did the job. Only one speed/no speed controls. Not what I was expecting at all; very disappointed! Save your money.</li>
    <li> Performs as described.  Holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I love this! No more pumice stones for me! Easy to use and quite powerful once charged. I love that it doesn&#x27;t run on batteries. Should&#x27;ve got this a long time ago! And it comes with 2 rollers, coarse and gentle.</li>
    <li> This is a great product especially for the money. It&#x27;s amazing how smooth my feet are and how much dead skin there was after using this product. It&#x27;s a great pedicure. Order extra rollers when buying this product to save on shipping. It&#x27;s a pretty powerful little machine that really does the job. You won&#x27;t believe how smooth your feet will feel and look even if you have some really thick callouses!!</li>
    <li> This works great for dry skin and calous</li>
    <li> I received this faster than expected!  I really love this product.  My feet are now smoother and skin feels much softer.</li>
    <li> Great product. So easy to use and very effective way to get rid of calluses.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this item. Highly recommend it. Only wish I could have gotten the same thing for the same price made in the USA</li>
    <li> UPDATE: Ok I loved the product at first  but now after a few uses the files dulled way to quickly, and it doesn&#x27;t stay charged long anymore. ALSO now for it to even spin fast I have to use it when it&#x27;s plugged up, if not the files spin slowly and doesn&#x27;t have any affect on my heels. || It was exactly as described, it doesn&#x27;t work too well with water, but its perfect on dry feet. You can actually see the follicles coming off with the lighting! Then I had a smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Good.My wife likes it.</li>
    <li> Great product to take care of your feet.</li>
    <li> helps keep my feet smooth</li>
    <li> I LOVE this pedicure grinder. I purchased a battery operational unit last week but it bogged down so bad that I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contemplated between the corded units and his rechargeable one and ultimately decided to give this one a try.  Some reviews said that it bogged down also, but I decided I could send it back if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is WONDERFUL.  There is minor slowing down at times, but NOT the same as the other units where it completely stops.  Even with pressure, this one will slow a little, but still keep moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts a LONG time.  I have used it for half an hour at a time and it was still going when I finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this unit after trying the others with great dissatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is WELL worth the money.  I plan to send them as gifts now that I know how great it is.</li>
    <li> I adore this pedicure set! I love how easy it is to use, this set had everything you need to give yourself a great pedicure. The set comes with two rollers (coarse and regular), a charger, and cleaning tools. I was able to give myself a great pedicure, in a short time. I love the price, and I even bought replacement rollers, and the seller got this to me pretty quickly, so I&#x27;m really happy with the seller and would happily recommend them. I would also recommend this item, it works great and although I&#x27;ve never tried the Amope system, I would bet that this Ckeyin set works just as well but is much cheaper. I&#x27;m happy that I decided on this item, instead of spending the extra dollars on the Amope system, this worked wonderfully and I love how great it worked on my feet.</li>
    <li> just what i wanted. thanks</li>
    <li> excellent product!!!...it works..</li>
    <li> I was leery ordering this as it shipped from China. No need, very good product and works great. Wish I would&#x27;ve ordered an additional set of stones. But it looks like the ones that came with will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works great. I was going to buy the expensive one that does the same thing until I read reviews on this and it&#x27;s less then a quarter of the price. It took about two weeks or Soto arrive but it&#x27;s worth it. Makes my feet nice and smooth..better then hand held ones. I&#x27;m constantly using one so I decided to make it easier on myself and buy the electric  one. Rechargeable is a plus cause you no you never have batteries when you need them..I tried it before I even fully charged it. It works great is worth the price and you&#x27;d think itd be more expensive. I generally buy anything made in China but the price made up my mind on this one, even though shipping took longer then if it was right here in the u.s.  does what it says. Isn&#x27;t made cheap. So far no problems . I ordered two extra rollers which came in the instead of separate at first making me think I didn&#x27;t receive them. I guess they just throw them in there in a bubble pack which is fine. Just confusing. As for quality it&#x27;s good so if your on the fence here but it.why spend the ridiculous amount for the more expensive one when it&#x27;s probably made in china anyways, right?&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and I&#x27;m  not one to buy from China and I&#x27;m extremely picky about my feet. I hate when they are rough feeling. I pretty much do them nightly before I go to bed with the foot lotion. Nothing better then smooth shinny feet. And I don&#x27;t wear candles in the summer or any open toe shoes but I have that foot thing. They ha e to be perfect. This item is just keeping them that way for me with much less effort..I&#x27;ll tell you make sure your over your tub or have a trash can under your foot cause a lot of dead skin comes off&lt;br /&gt; And cleaning them is easy. After every use I pop it out run it under hot water let it dry and I&#x27;m ready for the next time. Doesn&#x27;t get better then that , easy foot care , nice smooth feet and heels. I do my whole underside of my foot. This item is great. But it.</li>
    <li> This works pretty darn good. Easy to use and only takes a minute for good results. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s ever going to take more than a minute to get good and safe results.</li>
    <li> I did a little research(abou.t 10 minutes) and this one had some good reviews and I find that this pedi sander is excellent ,I used it right out of the box for about 20 minutes and then recharged it and it works great</li>
    <li> recharges fine.  light works but not necessary.  i walk barefooted all the time.  outside in the yard, in my garden etc.  this thing to me is primarily for use after u have soaked ur feet and filed them with the metal file.  my feet are not cracked as such n i filed them 1 month ago so they weren&#x27;t that bad.  this thng just doesnt cut it!  idk if it is the pad itself or the spin of it but its not worth it!.  gave it 2 stars just because it could smooth ur feet out after u scrape them with something else</li>
    <li> very slow.  I would suggest a file board or block instead!</li>
    <li> Good quality and works great.  Maybe a little stronger than I expected in its ability, perhaps for someone with highly calloused feet.</li>
    <li> Could have a longer battery life, and coarser shavers.</li>
    <li> Just used it once and loved it instantly. Package arrived well before the estimated date. I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. The best thing is that it&#x27;s chargeable and doesn&#x27;t need batteries. It cleaned the callous in no time and that too without any effort. I used it while I took bath so that my feet are soft when I use it. It worked like a charm. Money well spent. Worth every penny. I am going to buy more pieces to give as gift and recommend to all my friends. Thanks Ckeyin making such a great product.</li>
    <li> Works just like it said it does</li>
    <li> love this product, used 15 min on each heel, now I have so smooth skin, going to buy for my friends and family</li>
    <li> These products are popping up everywhere these days.  I don&#x27;t know why someone didn&#x27;t think of this long ago.  I wish it was a little more aggressive but I suppose it is a safety factor.  If you press too hard the wheel will stop.  Just take your time and it works well.  It takes away the rough patches much faster than a standard ped file.  I am over 50 and I live in northern Wisconsin where the winters are brutal on the feet.  Use this in combination with a product such as Gold Bond Ultimate Healing Foot Cream and the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> See my review for replacement files (called &amp;#34;grinders&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;Product is charged via an electrical charger; more power than battery operated varieties. May use on wet or dry skin - can use while in shower. If used often during sandle wearing weather, just as a nail files loose their filing properties, so do the files used with this product.</li>
    <li> I did not feel this had enough power to really buff or exfoliate my feet. It seems to work, though very slowly</li>
    <li> Excellent little gadget for the money!</li>
    <li> It works good on my feet. I&#x27;m a contractor and was tired of getting in bed and almost cutting myself( exaggerating)with my rough heels. I tried this the first time last week and it shaved about 30 lbs of callouse (exaggerating again). It&#x27;s cheap and it works,no exaggeration 👍🍀</li>
    <li> Please people- DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT use force when using any callous remover file. Whether it be electric, battery or manual. Do not try to remove (if 1st time using or have thick cracked feet) all in one sitting. It is better to use it for several days in a row making sure you wash and dry thoroughly before - using the towel to help loosen &amp;  exfoliate - Also wash and dry  after - applying a lotion to moisturize along with a pair of socks.&lt;br /&gt; As seen in the infomercials the model does not let the  file stay in one place for any length of time. Nor would  (SHOULD) you spend more than 5 Minutes Per Foot at at any one sitting. You may --- IF  ---you do as above, do morning and night to speed things along.</li>
    <li> not very powerful, but it does the job. If you&#x27;r sanding guys feet, be ready to spend some time if the calluses are thick.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe just how great this is. I didn&#x27;t think it was going to be this wonderful. Thank you</li>
    <li> This device does everything the description says it does. It&#x27;s easy to operate and clean. I&#x27;m loving the feel of my heels.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price</li>
    <li> Works good for the price I paid. Does what it says.</li>
    <li> Wow, great for the money.  You may want to buy a spare set of wheels.</li>
    <li> very good quality at a terrific price</li>
    <li> This is awesome. I have tried everything and this works. Wish it had faster shipping options for the replaceable roller heads. But i would recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> great price, works fantastic. where do i get extra rollers?</li>
    <li> Before I spent a ton on the big brands, I just had to try this inexpensive version.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be this thrilled!  Device was charged within an hour of opening, and delivered really, really fast results.  (On feet as dreadful as mine, that&#x27;s quite a job!)  Barely felt it, even my daughter who has very sensitive feet was raving about it!&lt;br /&gt;Even if it falls apart tomorrow, it was still worth the two fabulous pedicures we just got!!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my sister. she has rock feet. now she doesnt. lots of torque, can really get in there with it. she says it is definitely a five star product.</li>
    <li> i love this product more than any other product i have bought on amazon..if you go to the pharmacy or anywhere else they sell the one that is the &amp;#34;major brand&amp;#34; it is not as goodc as this one and i have had both..i would recommend this to everyone..especially if they have paid too much for the advertised one..this is great and i am buying another o ne for my daughter and mom!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this thing.  I am plagued by dry feet in the winter, no matter how much lotion I use.  I used this for the first time about a week ago and my feet still look great!  I slather on coconut oil each time I get out of the shower and that helps too.</li>
    <li> I was a little doubtful after reading the negative reviews, but decided to try it.  I had very bad cracked callouses especially on my right foot.  It came with a fine and a course head.  I am using the course head for about 5 minutes each evening.  My left foot is now smooth and comfortable.  The right one is dramatically better.  The callouses are smooth but I am still working on the areas that were cracked where I have gone a little slower.  Mine works very well.  I will edit it if it suddenly stops working, but it seems powerful and not likely to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things, others have mentioned and I agree that you should not push (it isn&#x27;t necessary and it would be bad for the unit) and read the instructions because as with any rechargeable tool the fasted way to ruin it is to keep it on the charger beyond what is necessary to charge it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this feet roller&lt;br /&gt;it works very well makes my heels smooth like a babies feet...</li>
    <li> Very useful and great product</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.  My feet aren&#x27;t that bad, no callouses or heavy build up of dry skin.  I usually use a pumas stone on a handle type tool with a black sandpaper textured on  other end and that worked well until it broke.  This tool is not strong enough to work on my lightly dried skin feet.  Can&#x27;t imagine people who have heavily dry or calloused feet get any results.  Not a good buy for me, just a waste of money.  Even fully charged there isn&#x27;t much power to work well and the rollers aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
    <li> Satisfaction guaranteed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for getting rid of callouses and any rough spots. Came with the kit for cleaning and had an extra roller with it. I used it multiple times and you can feel the difference right away. My mom has recently been dancing and has some huge callouses on her feet that were about half an inch high or so, and once I got done using it on her they were maybe only a few millimeters high. Reason I stopped was because underneath her feet weren&#x27;t fully healed over and if I went more it might have bled, but not because the item did that. If that wasn&#x27;t there I would have gotten rid of all of it. My mom ended up buying one herself because it worked that well. Only issue is that it does not take emjoi rollers like someone had said before and I don&#x27;t know where to get new rollers for it. Other than that, it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Actually works really well</li>
    <li> I like this machine. I like it is re-chargeable. I do not like how fast it wears down and needs to be replaced.</li>
    <li> you should get the amope.  this has a closed back and thats a problem.  this could be used to trim toenails for people that cant&lt;br /&gt;use hand clippers.</li>
    <li> Excellent low-priced alternative to the ones you see advertised on TV and at the drug stores. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s help a little bit. maybe need use often.</li>
    <li> Easy to use with great results.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete crap and I would&#x27;ve bought it if reviews hadn&#x27;t said it was ok. Unfortunately, I threw it off in anger and could find it to return until it was too late to do so.  I wasted $$ that I could afford to play with (bought spare rollers too). My catch for going for this product was bc it was electric and doesn&#x27;t require replacing battery, wrong move on my part. Should hv gone for amope or dr. Scholls.  Still have to buy either of those anyways.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. My feet are as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt! Very reasonable price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK it don&#x27;t work like I want it to</li>
    <li> It honestly works. Love it. Better that a 40 spa pedicure.</li>
    <li> Does a good job removing dead skin on heels. I like that it came with a replacement blade.</li>
    <li> This electric foot file works pretty good. If you follow the instructions and don&#x27;t apply too much pressure then it works great. My problem was that the last time I plugged it in I came back into the room a couple hours later. I smelled plastic burning and found this device burning hot to the touch. I immediately unplugged it as I felt it was now a fire hazard. Sure enough the plastic casing even dented in due to the heat and the internals had melted together. This is only after a couple months of use. So yes I liked it great while it was working. It gets 2 stars due to the fact that it could have caused safety issues from overheating.</li>
    <li> Works very well Love that it is rechargeable and comes with extra roller, brush and microfiber cloth.  Nice that it lights up.  Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.  They want $39.99 in stores for same type of item.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> The device was clearly used. They even didn&#x27;t bother to clean completely before sending it out</li>
    <li> I enjoy the callus remover.  My husband is very ticklish so he doesn&#x27;t find it quite as good.  But now he has human looking feet</li>
    <li> One of my peeves is seeing women in sandals where their heels look like the hoof of some animal--dry, cracked and rough.  I swore that I would never let my feet look like that.  This helps me to achieve that result.  Easy to use and my heels are soft and smooth.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great performance for the price. Liked it so much I recommended it to my dad and he purchased one as well. Not to gross you out but clouds of dry skin come off my feet every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Wish the head was little wider</li>
    <li> the buffing head is very small and after using it 2x the buffer strip was already flat and didn&#x27;t exfoliate my heals. i would of returned it, but had used it.</li>
    <li> For the price well worth it.</li>
    <li> Living in Florida, I go without shoes - sometimes even in &#x27;winter&#x27;.  Needless to say the heels of my feet become very hard and cracked.  This foot skin sander works very well to reduce the hard heels.  I have found starting with the coarse roller then the medium works best.  Would certainly recommend.</li>
    <li> fast service ,works great no complants ed</li>
    <li> Works good.  Comfortable to use.</li>
    <li> I got this for mom because she has rough and dried heels, and sometimes cracks. she loves this even though it does not remove all callus dead skins but she did say it helps a lot. it&#x27;s painless and ease to use. i just wish that it was stronger and can help remove all the callus and dead skins. i know she feels embarrassed to wear flip flops/flats/heels, any kind of shoes that shows her heels during summertime. still looking forward for improvements.. my mom still continues using this product, along with other feet cream.</li>
    <li> Works. Takes a lot of time. Better to soften feet and use a metal file.</li>
    <li> BOO to the product page. it was totally misleading. it did look like working with water. Guess What!!! It doesn&#x27;t. Fix your box design to something less DECEIVING!! if they had  negative stars, i would have given it -5 stars.</li>
    <li> Works great to remove rough spots on feet and heel. Came on time and in good condition.</li>
    <li> Crapp with a double C. Save your hard earned American Dollars</li>
    <li> Needs to be a little more powerful</li>
    <li> Awful does not help my feet at all</li>
    <li> I enjoy this item it really does make my feet nice and smooth</li>
    <li> This thing works amazingly well! Used it once on years of very dry heels that I frequently used a manual dead skin remover on and it made a huge difference can&#x27;t wait to see what happens in a week!</li>
    <li> Works good but use alot of rollers and it broke 3 months after i got it just stopped running, going to replace it.</li>
    <li> This is great.  No more having to file with the hand models.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What a nice way to get the callouses off your feet!  This is so much faster and better than trying to do it by hand.  I will never go back to the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style devices.</li>
    <li> I love being barefoot. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I adore shoes, but the first thing I do when I get home at the end of the day is shed my footwear like an old skin. Speaking of old skin...going barefoot as much as I do has some consequences; particularly rough, dry, tough and calloused feet. Small price to pay for feeling a breeze between your toes. For years I have tried various creams and scrapers to maintain the soles of feet to varying degrees of success, but I always had very stubborn, intractable callouses on the outer, lower part of my big toes. All methods of callous removal I tried carried a certain ick factor whether it is was goopy hands and sticky feet or accidentally scraping too much skin off a particular area, leaving a sore spot. When these little hand held &amp;#34;smoothers&amp;#34; came out, I watched prices and reviews and went for it when the price was right. The price was quite a bit lower on this smoother as opposed to the other dozen or so completely identical looking models I saw, so I chose the Ckeyin. (btw - I have no idea how to pronounce that). It arrived quickly and beautifully packaged, including a coarse roller, a fine roller, a charging cord and a tiny cleaning brush. It was fully charged, ready to go out of the box and I got to work on the two brutes on my big toes. Hallelujah - we have success. This little smoother works like a charm. It is lightweight, easy to maneuver and I think it would be quite difficult to &amp;#34;over-smooth&amp;#34; an area to the point of injury. I did experience warmth in the area from such constant friction, and I took that as an indicator to stop for the day. I love the fact that it operates without a cord so I can give myself a mini-pedi anywhere. I do; however, keep a paper towel underneath the area I am working on to catch the fine powder of dead skin the smoother removes. Within minutes, I had substantially reduced the size of my callouses. The little roller bars are covered in grit akin to sand paper, though much moresubstantial. They do wear out, and I recommend ordering the inexpensive replacements to have on hand. I am still on the first two rollers that came with the smoother, but I never want to be without a replacement. I still have two areas of thickened skin on the bottom of my big toes that I will continue to work on until they are soft and perfect, but they are now much softer and beautifully smooth and normal looking. You wouldn&#x27;t even know those nasty callouses were there if I hadn&#x27;t told you. The device recharges quickly, so you can go cordless, or you can also use it while it is plugged in, and it is simple to clean. The roller pops out easily with the push of a button and the included brush whisks out any dust that remains. I consider this purchase hugely worth it. I have been delighted with my results.</li>
    <li> Stop working on the June 23 could not return because deadline for return was June 16.this is a bad item will never buy from  this company again after that.I must have used it 5 times what waste of money.</li>
    <li> good product but wish I bought more replacements, my feet feel better. it works but not sure if I would buy again. It does a good job, but wish it had more power.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brand because it is supposed to be stronger than the others.  It does what it says it will do but I can take some intense work if you have heavy callouses.</li>
    <li> This is the best product ever.  Used to be embarrassed to wear sandals, but not anymore.  This makes your tootsies sooo soft and gets rid of the scaly skin on your heels.  You need to use this for a short while everyday or the problem will re-occur.  I also apply foot lotion to my feet every day after I shower to keep them soft.  Would not trade this product for anything.  Great and would Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love how soft this device makes my feet feel. It&#x27;s easy to use and has a light to see what ares need to be buffed, but if you have a lot of dry skin, I would recommend putting a hand towel down for all the powdery skin that flys off and can be messy, but the results are worth the mess. I just can&#x27;t believe how much softer my feet are, just follow up with your favorite lotion and you are ready for you favorite sandals. I&#x27;m especially happy that the ladies at my nail salon do not have to remove my callus, I&#x27;m super ticklish...😊</li>
    <li> works great, does the job.</li>
    <li> Did not like this item because eith new batteries it runs like the bastteries are low. No speed, it takes too long to do one foot.</li>
    <li> Work&#x27;s really well for me .Saved time and money.  I&#x27;m happy with this purchase. Battery lasted a long time .</li>
    <li> Great tool to keep the  callus items and  nails  smoothed and rounded....Thanks.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy it , it does not work.</li>
    <li> One time used and feet still smooth month later</li>
    <li> Poor quality rollers wear out fast.</li>
    <li> I almost hate to write this, I want the cost remain low, i love love it. A good friend saw it checked out my feet noticed I was ordering one for my daughter n asked me to order her one too!  She&#x27;s very critical so I&#x27;ll write her comment after I c her Momday.  My daughter said its awesome:) Iam going to order one for my daughter n law my son wants one so going to check out men&#x27;s versions. I&#x27;ll let you know. I charged it for full time as suggested so far no probs, the rollers should b in a bundle and at inexpensive price.</li>
    <li> This works if you have very light dead skin on the sole of the feet, but if you have a lot, it&#x27;s like the sole of the foot actually shaves the material of the device, rather than vice versa.</li>
    <li> Deliveed on time, great price, and does what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again</li>
    <li> Should have had one of these many years ago.  Glad I got the rechargeable one since there will be no problem to replace batteries.  My husband and I are both 79 and have thickened toenails and this little charmer grinds them right down where they should be.  Great price!!</li>
    <li> I received this Ckeyin foot smoother last week. It came in a timely manner. Very pleased with that. The product came well packaged and once I charged it the recommended time I was ready to tackle my feet! Fabulous !  The Ckeyin did it&#x27;s job more than I expected. It didn&#x27;t bog down if you keep the right amount of pressure. It was powerful enough to smooth both feet . I impressed for the price. It out preforms the more expensive product on market TV ads. I love the fact I can charge it up and not worry about batteries, too the Ckeyin came with an extra roller. I bought 2 packages more (2 per package). I am very happy with this product felt good in my hand not cheap feeling like it would break, so far so good but only have had 1 week now. I am so far very happy with my decision not to buy the over priced product I see on TV.</li>
    <li> I bought this to work on my boyfriends feet. I&#x27;ve bought many other products before. Nothing matches this one. We both love it. It works well.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I thought it would be</li>
    <li> Only used it once but so far it works wonders! Great buy for the price.</li>
    <li> great little foot smoother</li>
    <li> This works great.  I like that it is rechargeable and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> I really was happy with how this worked.  The only downside was how quickly the file wore down, but I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I almost put my pedicure service provider out of business for the winter. This product is great and works exactly like it should. Just make sure you purchase extra coarse replacements.</li>
    <li> these people are really great. 1st one ordered didn&#x27;t get to me so they sent a second free of charge. plus, it&#x27;s a great product; what more can one ask for....thanks!</li>
    <li> This does the job well. I am writing the review because of the light. If you are debating between this one by ckeyin and another, and think the light will sway you, be aware that the light on this is not on the &amp;#34;head&amp;#34; of it and is not all that useful. Depending on what part of the foot you are working on, and from what angle, the light only comes in handy about 25% of the time, if that. It is easy to use and to clean. It can NOT be used on elbows.</li>
    <li> THIS LITTLE GADGET WORK&#x27;S GREAT!! Doesn&#x27;t Hurt ,Tug or Get Hot or Quit!  KEEPS GOING STRONG ON ITS CHARGE !DID BOTH FEET AND POWER TO SPARE..I did  INITIAL CHARGE OF 10 hrs. To INSURE Batteries Maximum Capacity..No MORE ROUGH TOES AND HEELS..BUY IT! You won&#x27;t Regret This Purchase,</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my grandmother. She has A LOT of dead skin and callouses on her feet. She is diabetic and uses it although it does state that diabetics shouldn&#x27;t use this. However, she has been using it since May and it has done no harm. If you have a lot of dead skin to remove, it will take time to remove them. It works, but takes time and patience to see desirable results. I would suggest only using this on dry feet because sometimes the dead skin can get trapped in the device when the it&#x27;s dry so I can only imagine how it would be on damp feet. Also it&#x27;s easier to clean that way. The device does make noise but it&#x27;s not unbearable. The light indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s time to recharge it so that&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that her feet look A LOT BETTER than they did prior to her using this device. She loves it and I can honestly attest to the fact that it works!</li>
    <li> Love this  Works awesome.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing ever. I have tried everything else to get my feet smooth and this did it in minutes. I no longer need to go for a pedicure just to get the hard skin removed.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be more powerful, but it is not. I t does make your feet soft, but does not completely remove the callus. Not very happy with my purchase.  Maybe i will try Amope.</li>
    <li> product works well, I am concerned about ease if getting replacement parts, you must charge this item 24hrs to work, for thick callouses you must hold down on them for a long time, I would recommend but get extra parts when you order!</li>
    <li> This is a great product!!! I didn&#x27;t even need to charge to use it. 20 minutes after I had opened the package, my feet looked like I had just had a pedi.</li>
    <li> Product works great no problems so far you can even use it while it&#x27;s plugged</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. Definately gets rid of dry skin on my heels. I use this product outside, so all the dusty dry skin gets blown away by the wind.</li>
    <li> Works ok...not very powerful and needs to be wider</li>
    <li> Does what it says on the label, great product.</li>
    <li> An excellent tool to keep my feet smooth at half the price of similar products. It works quickly and safely, and replaces pumice stones and foot rasps. An added bonus is that it&#x27;s rechargeable. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> SHe was happy with it.</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, I live in AZ and there is NO way I could get away with using JUST this. I still have to use the razor things to shave of dry callisus, then use the cheese grater thing and then use the file. Afterwords, this device get up everything I miss and WOW. My feet look and feel great. My  whole routine is about 7 minutes without using this and looks...fine OR 13 minutes with this and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after first use, returning today. Hopefully next one will be better.</li>
    <li> This product was a very good buy. I am very glad I bought it. I plan to make a second purchase for a gift.</li>
    <li> very good work for  helth foot</li>
    <li> Works as expected, doesn&#x27;t use standard cartridges though took a point off for that, but rechargable...</li>
    <li> this is a simple easy to use product that actually works. i used to watch my girlfriend use this razor type of tool to shave off dead skin and such, and when i used it i had pretty sore feet the next day. i just shaved away far to much and had no idea. this that has not nor will not ever happen. and most important it works, it works good, and ive not had any prolems with it thus far, and it&#x27;s been a couple months. this is a very good product..</li>
    <li> I like it , and glad that&#x27;s it&#x27;s rechargeable .</li>
    <li> Needs more power to get the tuff stuff. It works great on light callus. I use the hand held pet egg on my hard callus. I saw this and figured I would try but I will stick with my hand held pet egg.</li>
    <li> ok the prod is on its way back ups got it today thanks johnnychildress</li>
    <li> I had just about given up on having smooth feet. I have tried every product/lotion/potion out there and nothing really worked. I purchased this with high hopes but low expectations and am thrilled to say that I have finally found the only product I have ever tried that actually worked. In less than 30 minutes, my feet are smooth and callus free, no small feat (no pun intended) as my calluses were very thick. I haven&#x27;t used it for 6 days now, but my feet remain smooth and callus-free.</li>
    <li> My Mom loves it.  She said it is the best thing she has ever had.</li>
    <li> Love it! Thanks a lot!</li>
    <li> Great price works well and is rechargeable.</li>
    <li> WOW! This really works great. I was not sure how it would stack up against the more expensive products, but it is fantastic. It was the least expensive and &amp;#34;rechargeable&amp;#34;, and came with a replacement roller. It&#x27;s gentle and painless - great product, I&#x27;d defiantly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Overall I am pleased with it.  Wishing it was a little more powerful and the grinder wheel was a little more coarse.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as good as advertized</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my feet all day, everyday so my feet have been calloused for years.  I feel and see a difference after just one use.</li>
    <li> Disappointed at the size of the foot file and the quality of the strength of the callous remover; not very effective.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this foot callous and dead skin remover. It works around your feels curves comfortably. My only draw back would be for the speed of strength in certain areas of my feet that require some elbow grease to remove the dead skin but overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> This little thing is AWESOME! I had HEAVY callouses on just my heels- thanks to this little gem, they are GONE. I am still on the original sanding stone that came with the unit..... Here a few tips for using this that hopefully will help those that are having problems:&lt;br /&gt;1.Use only on DRY feet. If you soak your feet or use this right out of the shower, the dead skin it removes will clog the pumice stone and you will end up having to replace the stone since it is nearly impossible to remove the &#x27;gummy&#x27; skin from the stone. It will also not do a decent job of removing the callouses when used on wet skin. 2.Don&#x27;t expect miracles. This is an awesome little device but those callouses that you have built up over years- don&#x27;t expect this unit to remove them in 10 minutes. I used this daily for about 3 weeks before I started to finally see the callouses start disappearing- give it time to do it&#x27;s job. 3.Use a light touch. Lots of reviews say that this is not powerful enough because when pressed against the skin the head will stop- if the head stops you are pressing TOO HARD- Lighten up on the pressure, the unit will work better with just light pressure against the skin, remember, Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day, have some patience &amp; don&#x27;t try to remove that 20 year (or older) callous in one 10 min. session. 4. Give it a blowjob once in a while. That&#x27;s right- turn the unit off &amp; blow hard on the little pumice stone that&#x27;s eating off all that dead skin- make sure that you aim in a direction where no one is- you will be amazed at what comes out of that little baby! Blowing out the dead skin from the stone periodically will help to keep it running smoothly. Make sure to blow the dead skin out of the stone (remove stone if needed) at the end of your use period before charging the unit. Now is the time to wash the stone if you must so it has plenty of time to dry before the next use.  5.Keep it moving. Don&#x27;t let the stone sit on one spot for a long length of time, keep the unit moving over different calloused areas of your foot, or turn it off in between working on one difficult spot. If you keep it in one spot too long, you will end up with a very hot spot, and the unit doesn&#x27;t seem to do nearly as good a job as if you keep it moving. 6.Patience, patience, patience. Again, I can&#x27;t stress this enough, don&#x27;t expect to get rid of all those heavy callouses overnight- this unit DOES work, but over time, so you need to be realistic, &amp; use this daily until you get them worn down, then depending upon how fast the callouses build back up, several times a week or less. Good luck, &amp; may your feet be &amp;#34;Baby Smooth&amp;#34; from now on! ;-)</li>
    <li> This works fine, but like most reviews, it is not very powerful.  So it takes awhile to get everything smoothed out.  However it is much cheaper than some of the stronger ones, so if you have the time, it works fine.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes caring for the feet very easy.</li>

    <li> I was actually looking for the more expensive advertised brand ... but I am pleased with the results of this smoother.  Works wonderfully well for both my husband and me.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, thanks, but I haven&#x60;t used it yet so I hope it works great!!!!</li>
    <li> Enjoying the Ckeyin very much. Scaled down lots of my foot callouses. Have used it weekly good product!</li>
    <li> great product, great price, fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I really love this foot file, it is very efficient and does what it promises. I like that it has a plug so no batteries to replace, and once fully charged you can use it for 30 mins before charging, any where in the house. It is pretty powerful according to MY standards and does the job great. Never had feet that felt this good, I can literally slip and fall if I am not careful after using this, sooooo smooth lol..</li>
    <li> It works very well I like this product.</li>
    <li> Works great - priced right.</li>
    <li> OK, but not quite as good as expected.</li>
    <li> I like it, but I guess I need to soak my feet in warm water longer than 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> The product performs as expected, and I love how smooth my feet are now. My only issue is that I cannot find refill rollers anywhere online. Do they exist, or is my only recourse to buy a whole new unit when the grit wears off the rollers? Anyone have an answer? Otherwise I would have given it a five star rating!</li>
    <li> Works very well,  should have bought years ago!</li>
    <li> I bought this and i love it i also bought one for my sister.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product. I would recommend this to all my friends and family. The price is great also.</li>
    <li> Easy to use got the product fast and love every minute of it</li>
    <li> I have it only a short time and used it twice.  It seems to work as described.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and price was the best I found. Delivery was relatively quick considering item shipped from China. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Good product &amp; quick service</li>
    <li> Love it this thing works real good</li>
    <li> I really had high hopes for this, especially after reading other reviews but if you have serious cracked feet, this isn&#x27;t what you need, UNLESS coupled with other products.&lt;br /&gt;  It would just take too long by itself.  I use it as a finisher after I scrap my feet with a more serious product, using this to fire down the rough edges.  By itself, its good for dry feet , not cracked.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. does exactly what it says it will do and cheaper than a lot of others on the market. I would order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after second use . Contacted Amazon to return , waiting to find out what to do and if I can return . I don&#x27;t recommend this product . Verdict still out on Amazon .</li>
    <li> WOW!  This works so well.  The fact that you don&#x27;t have to have batteries is just fabulous.  I bought the other brand, it was awful, and so expensive, I returned it.  This one does exactly what it says it&#x27;s going to do.  If there was a 10 star review, I would chose it.  It has a light for recharging, and a light for seeing what you are doing.  This little tool is a must have for everybody, it&#x27;s gentle, yet powerful enough to do a job on my tough heels.  Buy one for you, and your Mom and Dad, they will love you for it.  I am very happy. Update...good only if you keep buying the replacements, I ended up going with the big momma from a beauty supply, however, I grow hooves...lol jk</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works better than all of the brushes, scrubbers on the market today and easier on the hands.</li>
    <li> This is a  really handy little device. It makes a tedious job so much easier &amp; much faster. I really like it. So far I  haven&#x27;t  had to charge it so I  don&#x27;t  know yet how long it will hold c it&#x27;s  charge</li>
    <li> Works very well, love the fact that it&#x27;s rechargeable.</li>
    <li> This is a nifty little device. It works on REALLY hard places on the feet, AND, if you&#x27;re careful, it will trip your toenails.  I really like it.</li>
    <li> Good value.  Works ok but not powerful enough for me.  I hope they make a more powerful one.</li>
    <li> I really liked it! I was a little worried, but after I tried it I really saw and felt the difference.</li>
    <li> just wish it didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;guards&amp;#34;. Makes it hard to reach certain spots. I actually have found i use it more for my hands! :)</li>
    <li> love this, works great, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased</li>
    <li> Very good items nice job..</li>
    <li> Sorry but this is no way like a pedicure for my heels, in my opinion it did not do a good job .</li>
    <li> Easy to use and works as well as the more expensive brands.  This product would make a nice gift.</li>
    <li> It worked well enough at first but the battery was faulty and stopped working after I recharged it twice.</li>
    <li> Love This Product!!  I spent over an hour reading reviews on several similar products...decided on this one and I&#x27;m REALLY glad I did!  After one use my feet are sooo smooth and look great.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews (even though I rely on them myself) and so felt I really needed to let buyers know this product works.  Love that it is rechargeable as most of the other similar products apparently eat up batteries.  Don&#x27;t get impatient, you do have to go over your foot for  a few minutes but it isn&#x27;t hard or in anyway uncomfortable so it&#x27;s no problem.  I took a bath, then used this product on towel dried skin and then put O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Healthy Feet foot cream on, socks on and went to sleep. Next morning my feet were fantastic.</li>
    <li> Purchased for wife.  She seems very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> works great for the price</li>
    <li> This is a true callus grinder. I used this for 4 months now. I&#x27;m finally able to press down on the callus and scaly skin with the rotating grinder/ file without the machine cutting off as a safety feature. It gets them smooth without having to use additional products with this. I&#x27;ve never burned my foot by holding it in one spot too long like some reviewers, you&#x27;ll definitely know when to move to a different area. No other callus remover compares to this one, it trumps them all. It arrived with at least 1 hr of good charge, which it all I needed since it was so powerful. It holds charge for about 3 uses (roughly 3 hrs non stop grinding), as I shared it with friends during one of our vacations. You plug it up about 30-45 minutes for a full charge up. You can use this foot shaver while its plugged in if you choose. I comes with about 3 ft of cord. My husband and I have been using this as a pleasure oil for 6 months now. It&#x27;s not too water or too thick. It&#x27;s thick enough to hold itself in place for a few seconds to give you time to rub it in while massaging. It has the consistency of Wesson vegetable oil. We are also able to use this during intimacy. The oil does not burn or irritate our sensitive areas, and I do have sensitive skin. It feels very much like our own natural secretions. As a female, I&#x27;m also able to insert this into my special area with a couple of fingers just before bed and he does not know the difference between me naturally getting wet or not. This can also be used during oral sex if needed, so don&#x27;t worry if you accidentally apply it too soon and your partner decides they want to perform oral on you. Another plus is that it has a fresh smelling aroma to it like baby powder and vanilla, and the top is a leak free press to open style.  Also, if you spill some on you sheets, it dries up just like nothing happened. Please vote below whether or not this review was helpful to you.</li>
    <li> This thing works great.  You have to be careful to not take too much skin off.  It&#x27;s rechargeable instead of working off of batteries like Dr. Scholls which is why I bought it.  The refills are inexpensive, too.  Always a consideration.</li>
    <li> this is pretty darn cool.  It works as advertised.  buffed my heels to baby smoothness.  have used 4 times without having to change the roller yet.  My husband even used it on his calloused knees.  He likes it, too.  I only hope that when it becomes time to get new rollers that the process is easy and not expensive.</li>
    <li> This product is ok ,but is not thr best power</li>
    <li> What a cool device! I really like it. It works great on my feet.</li>
    <li> Feet smooth as a baby&#x27;s but a baby&#x27;s  but after using twice. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  My husband purchased the more expensive brand which works great. I decided to check this one out as a backup. No difference in the way they work both are easy to use. But this one almost half the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while now and it does a good job of filing down the callus on my right foot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I couldn&#x27;t see myself spending close to $50 on the other brand. I read reviews which led me to give it a shot. Boy was I disappointed! Bogs down and didn&#x27;t have the speed needed to do the job! I&#x27;ll just stick with my trusted foot file.. NEEDLESS TO SAY... THIS ONES GOING BACK!</li>
    <li> this product It&#x27;s not that good</li>
    <li> My wife absolutely loves this product!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive store models.</li>
    <li> I was a little apprehensive because it was cheap and came from China but it works well. If you have REALLY bad corns or really thick dry skin it might not be powerful enough but for the average person it works well</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t the most powerful device, but it does work well enough and I like having a rechargeable.  Each charge lasts about 30 minutes which is more than enough for me.</li>
    <li> Isn&#x27;t very powerful at all.</li>
    <li> My best most beautiful woman-friend absolutely loved this device.  I loved the price.  She uses it most everyday.  Great tool.</li>
    <li> It works great, removes roughness on heels. Just make sure you use small strokes 2 or 3 sec at a time. Ships from china make sure you allow a little time for shipping.</li>
    <li> Excellent product very surprised</li>
    <li> Order Two,  Love that its rechargeable, price its good/ However, it would be better if the extra roller was a rougher texture. Love the product.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, she brought 2 more for her sisters.</li>
    <li> I bought this item not sure what to expect but I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with my purchase! I have somewhat dry feet, living in Arizona and always wearing flip flops so I lotion my feet 4x a day and use a pedegg often but still had dry feet. I bought this on a whim to see what it would do and it works wonders! After one 10 minute use both my feet are silky smooth! I highly recommend this product and will be buying it as gifts for family and friends!!!</li>
    <li> Great little product.  Works wonders on dry winter feet - can&#x27;t wait for summer feet! Great price and super fast shipping. Will definitely recommend to friends and family!</li>
    <li> Did not work aked for refund</li>
    <li> I bought this electric spa remover for my girlfriend.  She loved it until the pin inside that holds the rollers broke.  The pin would not engage for the rollers to spin. I called Amazon and they were very happy to issue me a credit.  I will buy another one for her.  It&#x27;s not a bad foot callus machine for the price.  That&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
    <li> It arrived early ,was well packed and works awesome, verry happy with products and vemdvendor</li>
    <li> I ordered this reluctantly because I had ordered the &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; version that required batteries.  This was NOTHING like that one. I am so glad I got this one.  It works very well indeed! It doesn&#x27;t stop, &amp; start like the other did, and it gets rid of the rough spots.  I just wish I could reorder more buffers.</li>
    <li> Not powerful at all. Wish I would&#x27;ve not been cheap and went for the amope&#x27;. Kudos to those who loved this! No power.</li>
    <li> Amazing customer satisfaction. Best think has a light.</li>
    <li> This is good for minor dry skin on the feet, but I bought it for the cracked heels I have, and it doesn&#x27;t work for that.  Any other minor foot issues it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but had an Amazon gift card I needed to spend so I decided to try this. I am a nurse and I am on my feet all day plus I LOVE walking around my house bare footed. Does not matter the time of the year. I tend to get rough dry skin and a few minor callouses. I have the manual scrubbing wands to remove the skin but it can be a pain because it takes a while. I also often forget to use them. I don&#x27;t go regularly to get pedicures so this was a reasonable option to me. I can use on both feet without the battery running low. You can&#x27;t use too much pressure or it will boggle the machine down. The rotating disc is easy to remove and replace.I bought an extra set of replacement disc&#x27;s.  Fast shipping and item was  as described.</li>
    <li> Works great and about 20 dollars less than others.</li>
    <li> The ad shows ladies feet, but my man feet look great!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I ordered this for a cheap price, but I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly and included the unit, a charger, two rollers, a cleaning brush, and instructions,,, the unit even has a little light on it that&#x27;s pretty bright.  The instructions are in engrish, but they&#x27;re good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the initial charge (per instructions) of 8 hours, the thing fired up and had enough power to get the job done.  It spins at a pretty good speed and requires minimal contact with the skin for best performance (and I&#x27;d do this over the trash can or something!).  I think people that are having problems with this thing either 1) didn&#x27;t charge it properly or 2) are pushing too hard to the point that the roller stops spinning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect perfect finished results from one pass.  I usually spend 15 minutes or so on each foot once a week or so.  The battery life after each full charge is about 30 minutes.  In the instructions, it says to not charge the unit more than 16 hours, so I often unplug it and let it sit.  The battery seems to discharge during this period... so it is best to use it right after charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, though, for the price, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Oh my gosh ... I don&#x27;t know how I lived without this!  I have always had really dry skin on my heels and tried everything I could think of to get and keep them smooth.  This little gadget removed all that yucky dead skin in just a few seconds and my heels are in the best shape I can ever remember them being in.  Who invented this thing anyway?  What a genius!!</li>
    <li> This item worked as advertise.</li>
    <li> Waste of money! Not powerful enough.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this but sadly, it has made my feet worse.  I gave it a couple of days of use to see if it would improve but it did not.  Had to return and will be buying another brand.  I would urge you to spend a few more dollars and get another brand.</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve found for calluses and rough heels. It is easy to use, and very effective!</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona and wear sandals most of the time so my heals are always dry and cracked. Got this yesterday and charged it overnight to use today. My feet were in real bad shape and it took me about 20 minutes to do my first foot - because I wasn&#x27;t doing it right. I was moving over my foot quickly and not much was happening. I figured out you need to move around the area slowly. Once I slowed down, I started to see results. There were a couple of extra thick spots and I turned the tool over so it would grind in the other direction. Once I got it all figured out, it only took me 5 minutes to do my other foot. There was no pain -hardly felt anything at all. The charge never slowed down. Both my husband and I will be using this for a long time. I am also glad I chose this model as it is rechargeable and I don&#x27;t have to buy batteries. If you have dry feet, this is a great investment.</li>
    <li> This thing is GREAT! I used to try to keep the dead callused skin off of my feet by using a pumice stone in the shower on my softened heels. No more. This little thing works wonders. Just used it on my dry feet and they feel smooth as a baby behind. I can tell that I am going to have to keep at it for a bit to thoroughly get off the years of callused skin but it is going to be so much easier to keep up now with this handy unit. I am going to add the replacement rollers to my wish list now! Get it, you will not be disappointed! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Feet smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
    <li> The price is right. Comes packaged in bubble wrap. Works great. Has a LED to illuminate the work area. Ships from China, but took only 12 days.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I liked it so much that I bought three more to give as gifts. For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  You can see and feel the difference immediately.  When finished apply HEELTASTIC and wear socks for awhile to get the full benefit.</li>
    <li> So far so good but it is not very powerful !</li>
    <li> I figured this would be a gimick item like the PediEgg or those pumice grinding stones.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.  I have very thick callous build-up in several areas on the soles of my feet.  After 3 evenings grinding away with this device, I was down to soft skin.  In fact, I ground a bit too far in one small area and it bled a tad.  My fault for getting involved in a TV show while I ground away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers snap in and out very easily.  They are interchangeable with the Emjoi rollers, and can be rinsed under the fauced to clean them.</li>
    <li> I love this!  I can finally stop looking for a solution for my feet problems.  I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I read reviews for this and the similar items available before ordering, and I&#x27;m really glad I decided on this one. I chose it based on price combined with the reviews. I really love it, it works great, and I have smooth feet in just a few minutes. I have used it about 3 times since I got it, and now I wish I had bought it a long time ago. It is certainly a lot faster, and way less labor-intensive than using the manual file things and doing it the old-fashioned way. I have mostly used the coarser roller, so not sure how long it will last with continued use, but plan to order some replacement rollers to have on hand.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this foot smoothing device and I was surprised that it also had a light on it too, so you can also use it in the dark.I like this product so much that this will be my gift that I give from now on for all Birthdays and Christmas Gifts. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> My old rough feet have never been smoother. You know they&#x27;re getting bad when you keep snagging the bed sheets. This and my Burt&#x27;s Bees coconut foot creme and my feet have never been better.</li>
