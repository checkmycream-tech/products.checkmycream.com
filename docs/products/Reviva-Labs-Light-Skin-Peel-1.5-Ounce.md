<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the light skin peel for several weeks along with Reviva Night Cream and Night Gel.  It&#x27;s an excellent product.  Gradually together they are lightening my brown spots.  It&#x27;s important to wear sunscreen and a hat during the day.  The Light Skin Peel leaves my skin so soft and smooth.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I got this Reviva Light Skin Peel days ago, and I must say, it does do what it does, yet I don&#x27;t believe on the, \\&quot;Lightens up darker spots in one use\\&quot; promise, it takes patience unless you want very expensive laser surgery. Anyway, once I used this, it felt like it hugged my skin, and when I washed it off with my washcloth, it felt like my skin was rubber... Like high elasticity, with a softness touch, felt good. The smell did smell a bit chemically to me, but it&#x27;s not supposed to be like that. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it will do in the future! My skin glowed all day long all because of this stuff!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic find for a small price!  I can use it as often as I like and it leaves my skin smooth as silk.  Don&#x27;t let the 1.5 oz fool you, this product goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I bought this product some time ago, I don&#x27;t hve it anymore but I do remember it breaking me out though wasn&#x27;t too impressed with it</li>
    <li> I discovered this product at a local health food store... Decided to see if I could find it on Amazon and sure enough!  This stuff is amazing!  I&#x27;m 48 yrs old and most people do NOT believe me!  Since this is the only product that I&#x27;ve been using faithfully for years, I give it full credit!  It helps keep my skin clear, etc!  I just love it!  Once I ran out and didn&#x27;t use it for a few months, I could tell the difference.. So I know it works!  From now on though, I will buy it via Amazon!</li>
    <li> I like this peel becuase it does exfoliate well. A small amount is thinly applied over skin and when it is dry you rub it off. Easy to use and a little goes a long way. I think the price is reasonable. I gave it a four out of five stars because the product description states that it helps dark spots lighten up. I think that is difficult to prove.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s  fav since Rachel Perry went out of business. She&#x27;s half Italian and this is just right for her Mediterranean complexion.</li>
    <li> Nice mild at home peel. Tightens up your skin right afterwards. skin feels nice afterwards. will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Works great, better than origins clear improvements</li>
    <li> I like the ease of this product. It does make my skin feel clean and smooth. As others have stated, best to use a towel to catch the product when removing as I would guess that it is not good for  your sink drainage. I am like others, uncertain about the lightening of the skin, but if you like the classic at home mask, you will be pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Cheap presentation but good product</li>
    <li> It was hard to remove. Had to rub or wash off with water. Did not find it made an change in skin texture.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful peel!  It really leaves my skin refreshed.  The jar is only 1.5 ounces but it goes a LONG way making it a great deal on a facial product that really works.  Like others have said, don&#x27;t let the dried peel go down the drain.  I simply&lt;br /&gt;go outside and rub it off in the great outdoors and avoid the mess.</li>
    <li> Just used first time.very difficult to remove it with fingers and dry towel...took A long time..I. Hope we can just peel it off..hope it does what it says. ..</li>
    <li> Posting from my hubs Id...&lt;br /&gt;this product is awesome!  I do the mask, wash it off in the shower and then do a light scrub.  Love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
    <li> I first came across this product when I worked at a health food store in 1989. I was about 16 and had been suffering with some acne. I tried everything and decided to  try Reviva&#x27;s light skin peel.  It worked. It cleared up my skin, removed black heads and exfoliated.  I have been  using this product ever since and still have glowing skin.</li>
    <li> I love it and it  makes skin look better. I use it once a week and it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I received my cream before Christmas.  I am very impressed because i ordered it a couple of days before Christmas and chose standard shipping.  I am still using the product and have not seen any brightening/lightening of my skin yet but from day one that i used it my skin became very soft.  The packaging was excellent.  Thank you so much for your superb timely service.</li>
    <li> Arrived in good condition and within the schedule time period.  Love this skin peel, have used for years.  It is a great value with great results.</li>
    <li> Thank you Amazon for giving me a refund on this crap cause it did nothing for my skin but make it red and irritated.</li>
    <li> I have used this product once and I put it on my knees (which are dark and a little rough) to test it out. My knees felt much smoother after the first use. The peel tingled while on, but did not burn. I followed the directions and left it on 3-4 minutes. We will see how future applications fair.</li>
    <li> In 5 minutes this leaves your skin super smooth!</li>
    <li> Love it.  Had a facialist from Australia for many years and she used it.  I can&#x27;t see changing in the near future.</li>
    <li> This product makes your skin feel great after you use it!</li>
    <li> good product gave my face a tingling feeling when i first put it on but left my face feeling revitalized</li>
    <li> I received this on time and as ordered.  This is a great product.  Naturaly efolates your skin and leaves your face looking and feeling great.</li>
    <li> Easy and fast to use.I always looked younger than my age(now 59),until my skin was damaged by chemo.The very first time I used it my skin looked brighter and smoother and it continues to work.A little goes a long way,so it is very cost effective.I am very fussy about what I use,it must have safe ingredients and do the job.This product does more than expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this for the 3rd time in a row.  Great product that makes my skin look dewey and fresh and I&#x27;m 43! Will be a returning customer. I had to use this very sparingly to begin with and not every night until my skin had built up resistance.  It still tingles a little in pkaces, but I&#x27;ve come to like that as it feels like the active ingredients are working their magic.  My pores seem smaller,  my skin feels smoother and much prettier in complexion.  It also zaps any hormonal spots that try to break out. My go to night cream now.  Always super quick shipping too.</li>
    <li> Has a chemical smell and possible if my skin was not so oily and acne prone it might work better. It does smell like chemicals. The bottle is small. But alittle goes a long way. I used the whole bottle just because but it had no real effect on my skin overall. I have had actual chemical peels and so while I didnt expect that I at least thought it would be the equivalent to a good drugstore mask but it was not. really wanted a natural product regime but I also want clear wrinkle free skin so natural products are out at least for now. I would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  I had a professional chemical peel and I had to take two days off from work.  My face looked like I was tied to a car bumper and dragged down the road.  It was so painful, burning, peeling - never again.  A year later when I was starting to forget the agony, I purchased this from my neighborhood &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34;.  The price was over $20.  I use it on my face, my hands and my butt.  When I found this on Amazon for half the price I bought two.  I smear it on, shower with a wash cloth and then use a good moisturizer.  My old face feels fresh, my hands are pretty and my butt is smooth!  PS)  I have nothing to do with this company and hope they do not test on animals.</li>
    <li> This was not a great buy. I didn&#x27;t notice any results from this crime. It was easy to apply and take off, but the results weren&#x27;t there.</li>
    <li> Love love love Reviva Labs products. First time trying this item. Used once so far and it left my skin feeling very soft. Will try to update after more uses,</li>
    <li> I ordered that item for 5th time,because Every summer I have some  rash on my face and after using Reviva Labs Light Skin Peel the problem is gone.I recomende  it to my friends and they are happy too.For now I have it,but for the future I&#x27;ll ordere it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen major in less than 30 days. I will try the 10 % very soon.</li>
    <li> This is a good face mask, my face was noticeably smoother and brighter after peeling off the mask, will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin , and this Light Skin Peel is the best. I&#x27;ll use it before applying my makeup. It&#x27;s a pore minimizer, and improves the overall texture of your skin; Five Stars.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s the best deal in cosmetics for how well it works</li>
    <li> Interesting to me as I&#x27;ve never tried skin lightening before.  Something to think about.  Does it help ward off skin cancer?  Who knows?</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do facials, so really don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. I don&#x27;t really notice a difference that much. But I also am not consistant with using it to get those results. So, this is not a fare review. Worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love this peel and have been using it for years. I love the soft, clean feeling it leaves on your face &amp; the way it makes my skin look. Just be careful not to rinse down the drain, because it will turn into glue in your pipes. I always peel mine onto a cloth, then throw the peelings in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and looking great!</li>
    <li> I received the product all dried up! Wrote to them and never heard back! Usually product is great when you get a normal jar of it.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to get my second order of the Light Skin Peel.  It does make my skin feel refreshed and clean.  I cannot rub it off so I just rinse it off with warm water on a washcloth. I like it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, this peel exfoliates very effectively. I use it once a week, and I often receive compliments on my 61-year-old skin. It is a gentle alternative to harsh chemical peels. The bonus: no down time! You can do the peel, then put on your makeup and go out looking great that day. It makes my skin glow.</li>
    <li> Used this for years, given it as a gift many times.  Always improves the skin texture and circulation on any skin type. Apply on clean, dry skin, leave it to dry completely, about 15-20 minutes, until facial  expressions makes it flake, then remove with something rough in  a gentle, circular motion, rinse and tone.&lt;br /&gt;This mask has been around for years and revered  for its great results for a fantastic price.</li>
    <li> A friend recommend this and when my skin starts to break out I use this and my Zeno and the next day my skin is perfect. It works well to take off the dead skin that clogs pores and causes breakouts.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I loved some of Reviva Labs other products. I wasn&#x27;t impressed when I first opened the jar. It seemed like a cheap walnut scrub. The first time I used it still left some dry areas on my face, so I reapplied it in those areas. After removing it, I had redness for a few minutes but soon my skin was smooth and supple with an even tone. The instructions recommend once a week use, but I think you could use it everyday if desired.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. First I wash my face,neck &amp; decollete than put reviva on all 3 .areas. Let dry for 20 min. than rinse off PAT dry put your favorite moisturizer.  I use it twice a week.</li>
    <li> My skin feels fantastic and looks brighter after using the Light Skin Peel.  It&#x27;s easy, quick and effective.  I love that the product is all natural and actually performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used for years. Skin looks good after use. Is kind of messy. Good price. In the past have purchased from health store to find half product had dissolved/old. They returned for new. The one time I purchased from Amazon looked new and worked good. Great price, more expensive in store. Would recommend using once a week as it might get old if left to long without using due to all natural ingredients. I forget to use. Still, a great company and product.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do much for me but it worked well for my brother. So five stars.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 yrs. now and obviously like it.&lt;br /&gt;It puts a lighter glow on my face and like how it makes my&lt;br /&gt;face feel after using Reviva Light Skin Peel.</li>
    <li> Best face peel out there!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for myself and now my whole family is using it!  The peel does a great job of exfoliating dead skin cells and leaving skin refreshed and glowing while not irritating it.  I use it 2-3 times a week and my skin looks like it is at least 10 years younger!  This is a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for your skin care regime and it is priced right and made with natural non irritating products.</li>
    <li> It was dried out when I received it ..horrible</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good if you have no breakouts at the moment.</li>
