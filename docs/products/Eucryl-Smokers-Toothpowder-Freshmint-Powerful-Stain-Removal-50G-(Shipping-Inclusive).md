      <li>The difference is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Nice taste but</li>
      <li>Thank you very much very good product and fast shipping</li>
      <li>Ok but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as I thought it would be.  </li>
      <li>Amazing, and I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to smile!!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say exactly which products did the job, as I bought everything I could find with a great review and used them all at once..</li>
      <li>Really love the way this makes my teeth look and feel.</li>
      <li>It really does a good cleaning job.</li>
      <li>Not working as fast but still using, tastes good.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a good gentle abrasive for stains.  </li>
      <li>Love the fresh flavor.</li>
      <li>It has a light minty flavor.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel really clean after using.</li>
      <li>Makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
      <li>More frequent use may lead to gum irritation (as it is, after all, an abrasive!).</li>
      <li>the delivery time was sooner than expected which is always good.</li>
      <li>You really cannot find tooth powder anymore.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker &amp; occasional smoker &amp; it does brighten my teeth as well as make them feel clean</li>
      <li>for the price I&#x27;m going to price out the ingredients at my local scientific supplies store and see if I can make a far larger batch for a lower price.  </li>
      <li>6 months later, the stains are still gone and I barely use anything but toothpaste now.</li>
      <li>I bought a relatively cheap rechargeable electric toothbrush for kids at Walmart (Oral B Pro Health Jr) because the adult version was just expensive, then used a daily regimen of combining several products - StaiNo Tooth Stain Eraser to rub problem areas directly, brushed with Plus White Xtra Whitening Toothpaste, then brushed with Eucryl Smokers Toothpowder for an abrasive, rinsed with Nature&#x27;s Answer Complete Oral Care PerioWash, and then brushed my gums and gum line with NaturaRx Dentizyme drops.</li>
      <li>Worth the money no doubt, don&#x27;t forget to buy a hard bristle brush from wisdom</li>

<li> A little chalky.</li>
<li> but about once a week, I moisten my electric toothbrush head and dip it into the powder and slowly and carefully brush my teeth.  </li>
<li> However, use as directed (no more than 3x per week).  </li>
<li> Terrible that it&#x27;s not sold in the US and Amazon has to ship it via air mail from the UK!  </li>

    <li> Cost more to ship than the product cost, but, it was worth not only the cost, but the long wait (this is shipped internationally)  Used twice a week has made a definative difference in my teeth.  Would consider buying by the case and selling it locally!</li>
    <li> This really works.  My husband smokes a pipe and this is a great stain remover.</li>
    <li> I like this. It has a light minty flavor. A little chalky. My story - I bought a relatively cheap rechargeable electric toothbrush for kids at Walmart (Oral B Pro Health Jr) because the adult version was just expensive, then used a daily regimen of combining several products - StaiNo Tooth Stain Eraser to rub problem areas directly, brushed with Plus White Xtra Whitening Toothpaste, then brushed with Eucryl Smokers Toothpowder for an abrasive, rinsed with Nature&#x27;s Answer Complete Oral Care PerioWash, and then brushed my gums and gum line with NaturaRx Dentizyme drops. This was all to remove embarrassing dark brown stains along my gum line caused by years of smoking, coffee, tea, and soda.. that I thought was decay. My dentist verified this as being decay and said there was no way to remove it, but I was determined. I can&#x27;t say exactly which products did the job, as I bought everything I could find with a great review and used them all at once.. but the lines were deep stains, and the stains were gone in a matter of days using these products. When I came back the following week for my first cleaning in years.. I also had almost no plaque left, other than a small amount between my teeth. Fastest cleaning ever.. 6 months later, the stains are still gone and I barely use anything but toothpaste now. Amazing, and I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to smile!! Pain that I was having from a filling also subsided. To me.. all of those products get 5 stars!!</li>
    <li> Thank you very much very good product and fast shipping</li>
    <li> This stuff is a good gentle abrasive for stains.  Terrible that it&#x27;s not sold in the US and Amazon has to ship it via air mail from the UK!  However, use as directed (no more than 3x per week).  More frequent use may lead to gum irritation (as it is, after all, an abrasive!).</li>
    <li> DONT BREATH IN WHILE BRUSHING TEETH</li>
    <li> You really cannot find tooth powder anymore. You do not want to use this often but once a month it is great&lt;br /&gt;to polish teeth and see them sparkle.</li>
    <li> 4 out of 5 dentists will not approve  of this product because it worked perfectly the first time! This product kidnapped the plaque from my teeth and raped it all the way down the drain. Worth the money no doubt, don&#x27;t forget to buy a hard bristle brush from wisdom</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a coffee drinker...not a smoker.  I use this paste once a week.  Works great....good flavor too.  Just have to be careful not to every spill the tub it comes in.....it&#x27;s not a tooth paste, it&#x27;s a powder.</li>
    <li> Ok but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as effective as I thought it would be.  Nice taste but for the price I&#x27;m going to price out the ingredients at my local scientific supplies store and see if I can make a far larger batch for a lower price.  Shipping was faster than I thought.</li>
    <li> It really does a good cleaning job.</li>
    <li> Not working as fast but still using, tastes good.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.</li>
    <li> Powdered granulated toothpaste. It works as described. I use it once a week for coffee stains on my front teeth.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel really clean after using. Works really well. I switch back and forth with my other toothpaste. Lasts a long time, too.</li>
    <li> Love the fresh flavor. I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker &amp; occasional smoker &amp; it does brighten my teeth as well as make them feel clean (like when you run your tongue over your teeth). Considering it ships from UK the delivery time was sooner than expected which is always good. This is my 2nd purchase of Eucryl toothpowder &amp; I will continue to buy on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Yes, it works.  I smoke and I drink coffee and need a product like this.  I don&#x27;t use it every time I brush my teeth but about once a week, I moisten my electric toothbrush head and dip it into the powder and slowly and carefully brush my teeth.  The difference is amazing.  When this one is gone, I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
    <li> Really love the way this makes my teeth look and feel. Does not cause me any discomfort.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Makes your mouth feel clean.</li>
