      <li>I am glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>I love these hair extensions.</li>

      <li>Also the hair falls out of the wefts just with you touching them.</li>
      <li>They were not 15&amp;#34; they were more like 8&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>got these free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>

      <li>I love it ...</li>
      <li>Love the quality and the nice touch of a free gift.</li>

      <li>these are cast-offs which is why they are a much better price.  </li>
      <li>It says a number 2, but it is more like a 4.</li>
      <li>, i get many compliments 😄</li>
      <li>I love my extentions, and</li>
      <li>The hair wefts were thicker at the top than I thought they would.</li>
      <li>So 4 out of 5 :)</li>
      <li>I am for sure keeping them on my favorite list.</li>
      <li>One would work for most.</li>
      <li>They are perfect for my thin hair! :D</li>
      <li>Love it no one can tell I&#x27;m wearing clip-on hair, I will buy more</li>
      <li>: They arrived sooner than I thought they would, so I was extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;you see my  hair more than you see my extensions</li>
      <li>most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Concern:&lt;br /&gt;one of the one piece clips didn&#x27;t snap probably</li>
      <li>It was good the first day and</li>
      <li>It arrived in about a week, which is pretty good.</li>
      <li>I do say to curl them because it gives a better bounce but other than that great!</li>
      <li>2: They go in super easily!</li>
      <li>and I want a full refund of my money. !</li>
      <li>Clips in easily.</li>
      <li>You may need to purchase a couple more packs to get the right effect or look for packages with more weight.</li>
      <li>Other then that love them!!!</li>
      <li>When I received them, they were packaged well and the hair looked nice and the color was an exact match.</li>
      <li>The hair itself is fine but who cares if they fall out every10</li>
      <li>It is a really light brown.</li>
      <li>Great quality especially for the price!!</li>
      <li>they don&#x27;t fit ...</li>
      <li>They just thought my hair looked fabulous.</li>
      <li>Cheap and not Remy.</li>
      <li>I ended up placing a second order because I was so pleased with them, and they blend in with my hair surprisingly well.  </li>
      <li>These are great for adding length to your short hair its quick and easy and I need that being an on the go mom.</li>
      <li>The clips on are super easy to handle.</li>
      <li>I very much wish that the hair had been in better shape</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought it to practice putting on clip-on extensions. My sister, daughter and I have had so much fun with it. I haven&#x27;t tried washing or styling it yet.</li>
    <li> Bought for my niece&#x27;s prom.  The hair wouldn&#x27;t hold curls.  If you want straight hair this will work well.  The clips worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> The hair would not straighten properly, at all. I took it to different stylist and we all agreed it was not a good grade of hair. The packaging made it worse by how it was folded up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it by the quality of the hair however they have the best clips threaded on I loved that. The hair stayed in place and the clips didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
    <li> Shipping was super fast, I got them in less than a week. That&#x27;s a positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the package, I was a little upset with the condition the extensions were in.  The hair is real, but my set is extremely dry and brittle.  I can see where there was at least double the hair sewn into the weft, but at least half of the hair has broken off because of it&#x27;s bad condition, leaving the hair around the weft thick and prickly and the ends very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put the in my hair, I was disappointed at first with the look of the hair.  Although the color matches mine perfectly, it was very dull and mine shines.  I will have to do a lot of moisturizing to the extensions to get them healthy enough to match my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, once I styled and curled it, it looked good.  It held the curls very well and did not tangle easily. So, I would give the final result 4 stars, but the effort it took to get there was more than it should have been.  I very much wish that the hair had been in better shape and I could have had some that weren&#x27;t broken.  I have a feeling these are cast-offs which is why they are a much better price.  They will do, but if you are looking for quality, I would spend the extra money somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, and I must once again say, that this review is by Mrs. Gregory Carbis, and the Mr would like me to make very clear he does not wear extensions. :-)</li>
    <li> well one thing i gotta say that i did love was the fact that it only took 4 days to arrive&lt;br /&gt;and the thing i hated was that the hair started falling as soon as it arrived&lt;br /&gt;it has not much hair at all&lt;br /&gt;since i have short hair you can easily noticed I&#x27;m wearing them&lt;br /&gt;you see my  hair more than you see my extensions&lt;br /&gt;im not wearing them anymore&lt;br /&gt;i tried them on once and i could now say in my opinion it was a waste of my $&lt;br /&gt;i ordered dark brown and they came out to be just brown&lt;br /&gt;((((((but then again this is my opinion, you reading this might think the same or completely different))))))))&lt;br /&gt;at the end of the day your the one that decides hope my review helped thanks</li>
    <li> Very very thin hair , I have some what thicker hair and this feels like an old women&#x27;s hair who began to thin as the years go by , I would have to by 2 more sets just to make it match my thickness ,</li>
    <li> You may need to purchase a couple more packs to get the right effect or look for packages with more weight.</li>
    <li> This product is very high quality. It is exactly the color I was expecting. The clips are sturdy, and the hair is soft to the touch. It arrived in about a week, which is pretty good. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Matched my color perfectly! Curls nicely, very thin but my hairs thin so it looks very natural. Great for adding body to thin hair, I only needed 1 bag.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome</li>
    <li> Not nice did not like this item hair was course and had a gray hair down the middle would not recommend</li>
    <li> Product was thin with gaps in the strands. Product looked used and burnt strands. very thin and was missing entire patches of some of the larger extension pieces. They were so terrible I will never use them. I have purchased remy hair extensions from another place and they have never looked like this. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> the hair touch soft and smooth, very used easily . After co-wash, you need to some softeners to keep it soft and smooth .</li>
    <li> The worst waist of money! SOOOOOOO thin! It only has like 3 inches from seem to root of hair until it TOTALLY thins out into nasty little wisps of icky stringy hair and the clips are the size of a fingernail polish bottle! For real! If you want clip in extensions and want good quality for a low price look at the Tressmatch Remy! Go, now!</li>
    <li> For the price, its worth it. Color is the same as photo. It doesn&#x27;t tangle at all, but they shed; very little though.They are thin so buying more than one pack is a must if you want a full look. Worth the purchase.</li>
    <li> Can not be dyed such a waste of money. Extremely False advertising. Awful product! DONT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Kinda thin but lookin feel pretty good</li>
    <li> I love these hair extensions. They are just right for adding thickness and volume to my hair. If you wanted these for length then I suggest getting two or three sets. They feel soft and look natural. They took hair color well too. I dyed mind the same color I dye my hair. I will definitely order these again.</li>
    <li> Very thin, very cheap quality.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my birthday to get a differnt style and add length. Clips are difficult to hide if you have thin hair. Quality is great and they style nicely!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I definitely recommend it! The extensions are so healthy and natural you can&#x27;t even tell they are extensions</li>
    <li> I just wanted to play around with extensions but not spend a lot of money. The quality on these are goods not real think but fun to play with.</li>
    <li> The whole point of getting extensions is to help make your hair appear thicker, bouncier, and healthier. These extensions do no such thing. The hair is thin and unhealthy looking. When i put them in, you could see the spacing between the pieces at the bottom. My hair looked downright ratty and not Kardashian-like at all (like I envisioned them to be).</li>
    <li> this is crappy and thin, i thought ordering two would be good but when i took it out of the packaging it&#x27;s not what i was expecting at all.....</li>
    <li> these were horrible. i had to send them back</li>
    <li> These were pretty aweful. I knew there weren&#x27;t going to be amazing, so my expectations were very low. But they were far worse than anticipated. The hair was an inch and 1/2 shorter than they should have been. Actually the same length of my hair. I didn&#x27;t get them to add body, but to lengthen. The hair wefts were thicker at the top than I thought they would. Which would have been great if the hair wasn&#x27;t broken. It looked like someone had taken thinning sheers to each piece. It looks super unhealthy and gross. I got 2 18&amp;#34; sets from a different seller. Hair is much more healthy and beautiful. And the same price.</li>
    <li> They get nappy fast , it didn&#x27;t come in the color I ordered , doesn&#x27;t provide a full look in hair even when installed in hair ! not worth the money at all !! My opinion , DONT BUY !!</li>
    <li> Love it no one can tell I&#x27;m wearing clip-on hair, I will buy more</li>
    <li> The clips are to thick for hair amount you get. They should provide you with less clips and more hair.</li>
    <li> The clips were very hard to use and would not stay in place plus they did not blend well enough with my natural hair.  Wanted to add fullness but in the end I had to scrape them and just put rollers in my own hair.  The clips were too hard to work with and visible.</li>
    <li> The hair came in a few weeks earlier than expected. it was exactly what i needed but it looked like it wasn&#x27;t enough till i combed it out. I would advise you to get two bags if you have short hair or want a full head</li>
    <li> I really like the curly hair but when you brush it the hair comes out of the extension and it&#x27;s a little crazy at the bottom</li>
    <li> It is the second time i order this hair and i am extremely dissapointed. The hair is extremely thin, it does not even look natural, its super nappy so it gets hard quickly, it is short, very short, the clips fall out constantly so ive had to sow them in. very very very disappointing. never again am i buying this product, it also took a long time for it to get here. Soooo not worth what i even paid for. money thrown in the toilet basically. do NOT get this product.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much considering the price. But it&#x27;s a little distasteful to change the labeling of a product after an order has been placed. Prior to purchasing they were listed as \\&quot;Remy human hair\\&quot; and after the order had been placed the label had been switched to \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot;. They definitely can&#x27;t be curled or dyed. Don&#x27;t waste any time with these.</li>
    <li> The items arrived and did not look full of hair when I brush them they started loosing a lot of hair. When I put them on they get really tangled. The clips are a bit loose on your hair also. Not a good buy if you are planning to use them for a long time. Maybe up to 4 wears. after that I put them away.</li>
    <li> Dear buyer,&lt;br /&gt; This product is exactly  what I paid for. Although they are kind of thin they but nonetheless, they are real hair extensions.</li>
    <li> These are not high end extensions, and they dont claim to be. 1: They arrived sooner than I thought they would, so I was extremely pleased. 2: They go in super easily! I am not always the brightest bulb in the bunch, but I had no problems getting these in whatsoever. 3: They are a great product! I will probably order another set just because I have been wearing them every day so they are a little worn, but all in all I love this product! They look pretty real too for being synthetic extensions! They add volume and length and I only have one set.</li>
    <li> I have very very thin hair and these were still to thin&lt;br /&gt;plus the clip broke first time wearing them.</li>
    <li> When I tried to curl the hair it burned and didn&#x27;t curl. Not very happy about it.</li>
    <li> Very cheap, does not curl and hair falls out</li>
    <li> This product came to me so fast, I was shocked. The extensions themselves are very thin, and ill have to order more, but they are so worth the price. The hair is soft, long and shiny and I love it!! Defiantly a great buy and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Really hard to use, so waste of money in my opinion</li>
    <li> Bought these hair extensions for my daughter.  With her hair half up and half down the look is very natural when she curled them and her hair. They are thin and I wish there were more than 7 pieces so I bought her another pack so she can wear in different styles.</li>
    <li> I love my extentions, and Im gonna order in blonde. It looks awesome and natural. The clips on are super easy to handle.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very thin and it&#x27;s not real hair mine feels like American girl doll hair  don&#x27;t get it  not worth it</li>
    <li> I must say I was skeptical about buying these extensions. I bought two bundles. When I received them, they were packaged well and the hair looked nice and the color was an exact match. I put them in and instantly loved them. They matched my hair texture (and I&#x27;m 7 weeks post relaxer) and it actually looked like my hair. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments on my hair all morning! These are better than the Aramas clip ins I&#x27;ve gotten in the past.</li>
    <li> the hair extensions arrived right on time.  They are sturdy and feel just like real hair.  I put them in my hair and then trimmed them so they would blend in as I grow my hair out a little.  very pleased.</li>
    <li> this product is good for filler and a little extra volume but not if your trying to lengthen, its way too thin. i liked it though, i have pretty fine hair anyway so it matched my hair&#x27;s texture and feel a bit better than the expensive one i had gotten before that was pretty thick hair follicles.</li>
    <li> These clip ins were exactly what I needed for a cosplay. They can handle heat from a flat iron or curling iron, but do require some work to keep the shape. Excellent, and would use again.</li>
    <li> They were too dry and we&#x27;re long enough. They were not 15&amp;#34; they were more like 8&amp;#34;. Not sure if I should get them from here any more</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many clip in extensions and they stayed in just fine, the clips on these however, suck! They&#x27;re hard to open and close and they don&#x27;t stay in your hair well. The hair itself is fine but who cares if they fall out every10 minutes?!You&#x27;re better off paying more money for better extensions than saving a few bucks with these pieces of garbage.</li>
    <li> I like the hair,  size was perfect but for me it was to thin and did not cover my natural hair, I should pick something thicker...</li>
    <li> I bought 2 pack, the hair is very thin and does not offer a full look. Would not recommend it</li>
    <li> So I got these today and they came pretty fast which is great. BUT they were not dark brown. My hair is dark brown and it looks almost black so I just had to dye them a darker brown it was no big deal. I like them a lot I should have got them in a different length though. I layered mine and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them. They are perfect for my thin hair! :D</li>
    <li> The extensions arrived within two days.  I ordered dark brown and they matched my hair perfectly, also having the different sizes is such a nice option to have.</li>
    <li> Great set of exstentions. Mine was thick and healthy. Only problem which is why I&#x27;m giving a 4 star, is the clips car hard to keep in and the hair falls out after the third wash. But only a little bit. Other then that love them!!! Wash them, straighten, curl, and dye them and they are still wonderful :)</li>
    <li> Love the item! I recommend ordering two sets of you have short hair. I did and I usually end up using all of one set and about half of the pieces from the second set so it looks full enough and it helps make sure the transition from my hair to the clip ins isn&#x27;t obvious. They can get a bit tangly after the first time you wear them, but the hair straightens and curls very well and looks natural! Also, I ordered a 14 inch set and the ones I received were much much longer (had to be at least a 22) but I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>
    <li> I will be returning my items asap! The hair is very thin and stringy. Also the hair falls out of the wefts just with you touching them. I was scared to brush because so much came out just unwrapping them! Also this company places you phone number on the shipping lable for the world to see.</li>
    <li> Should have order 2 of these</li>
    <li> This one u need abt ten or more to fill ur hair full and the color is lighter then what u see</li>
    <li> These extensions are the same ones you can get at beauty stores for $90.  They looked even better in person then in the picture and completely surpassed my expectations.  I ended up placing a second order because I was so pleased with them, and they blend in with my hair surprisingly well.  Very impressed with this item!</li>
    <li> they are exactly what they said they were, very impressed with how well they match my hair.  Curl and straighten well.</li>
    <li> I got these extensions in great quality i have a growing out pixie cut and these defitnitley hide the mullet phase of growing my hair out! I do say to curl them because it gives a better bounce but other than that great!</li>
    <li> The color is off, not dark brown, more of a medium brown. I will try to dye the extensions the next time I dye my hair.</li>
    <li> Perfect extensions...color is spot on with what i needed.I will buy these again! Great pricing also.Clips hold well also. Great !!!</li>
    <li> I rated it with two stars because the color I got was definitely not dark brown and they were to thin. They did get here in about a week though.</li>
    <li> I like it and it blends ok with my hair, but I&#x27;d describe it as medium red-brown, not dark brown. Clips in easily.</li>
    <li> Cheap and not Remy. Something you buy off the street. Imitation hair. Makes your neck itch. Pay the extra money.</li>
    <li> As soon as I put on my extensions I tried to straighten them and they burned and fell apart. They suck I hate them and I want a full refund of my money. !</li>
    <li> When I ordered it said human hair then I looked back to it and it said synthetic.  Not sure who&#x27;s fault that is so that&#x27;s not why I rated it 4 stars. The color says dark brown. I&#x27;ve gotten dark brown before and it matched my hair completely. With these it was more of a black than dark brown. The shipping was good though. It came a day earlier than estimated</li>
    <li> Not satisfied whatsoever. This is not what I expected it to be. It says it&#x27;s just like real hair, but it feels just like doll hair. It gets tangled in a knot very easily. I have not tried styling it because I am afraid it will melt with a straightener or curling iron. I have not tried to dye it either. I don not think it would survive hair dye. I would not recommend buying this product for anyone.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair, and these extension clips are fab! I curled them on high heat with my flat iron and they didn&#x27;t burn or frizz. If you want length and fullness I would recommend getting two packages, but the one package of clips I have now looks good, and in the future I will order this brand from AMAZON!</li>
    <li> Way too thin.. &amp; my hair is thin &amp; it just looked rediculous!!!! Would never buy these again. barely any hair in the clips</li>
    <li> i got this hair I love it ...it curls and washes well...it blend in with my hair everybody thinks its my hair!!! you have to take care of it like its your real hair.2 packs is a must!!! the only way I can see a problem with this hair is if a person don&#x27;t know how to take care of it or if they don&#x27;t buy 2 packs. other than that the price is great and I will buy more again!!!</li>
    <li> Loved the hair! Next time I have to make sure I buy darker brown</li>
    <li> The hair is thin so I ordered two bags. The color wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It says a number 2, but it is more like a 4. It is a really light brown. I am not wearing it again &#x27;til I dye it. The clips stay in pretty good, but my hair is thin on the sides so those ones kept sliding out.</li>
    <li> They were actually closer to 17&amp;#34; so free hair! Wasn&#x27;t the thickest but does the job and makes my hair look long, people couldn&#x27;t even tell it wasn&#x27;t my hair.</li>
    <li> This hair is beautiful! I ordered dark brown and it looked so natural and blended very very well with my own. This says synthetic hair but the hair I received was 100% human so that was a plus. It curled very nicely on low heat with my straightener and curls lasted all day.. I only wish they were a little more thicker on the ends. So 4 out of 5 :)</li>
    <li> This is my first time using extensions. My hair has been thinning for about the last year. The extensions are pretty good quality, look natural. I had to cut them a little to blend them in. They really add fullness and body to my thin hair. None of my co workers or family members could tell I had them in.  They just thought my hair looked fabulous. My hair is very dark brown but the dark brown made my hair look like I had reddish highlights in my hair. I like it but I will order the Off Black for when I want an easier blend.&lt;br /&gt;All and all I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I have short hair(bob style), it blended in perfectly. I ordered another set so I could have more fullness. If you have short hair, it&#x27;s a must, you need to order another set. If you are adding extensions for more fullness, one is perfect. I had them within a couple days of ordering. I am for sure keeping them on my favorite list.</li>
    <li> These are great. I have been wearing them. I am a little jelous that they are so much softer than my actual hair but they match color perfectly.</li>
    <li> this hair was horrible, very soft but so thin it would never make any fullness to your hair,and for adding leangth it would do but is still too thin to make any difference,boy would i like a refund !!&lt;br /&gt;Sad I never got to use it thank goodness I didn,t spend alot of money for it,&lt;br /&gt;It,s true you get what you pay for !!!!&lt;br /&gt;But I thought it would be good after seeing selers other products online,They really need to double the tracks in order for the hair to be usefull.</li>
    <li> Love them!they match perfect and have great thickness to them so they blend very well!  Looking to get another set!</li>
    <li> They got here fast and the color is right on  .. But that was about the only good things about it they are very uneven the hair was falling out of them in the packeg ... I can not wear them they don&#x27;t fit ... I would not buy this kind ever again thank u</li>
    <li> OK so these did not make me happy at all they are nothing like the pictures, they are thin and so shinny like barbie doll hair.. I know it&#x27;s just $15.00 but ever Walgreen&#x27;s fake hair looks better than this</li>
    <li> well let me start by saying these r not remy hair or real hair cuz when i tried to curl it ,it stuck and got freezie n didnt even gurl it looked like it just burned the hair i wouldnt buy these again.</li>
    <li> It was good the first day and then a few days later it&#x27;s a rats mess but I brushed it out every night. But other than that it was good</li>
    <li> Hair is high quality but look at how much hair comes with.. Don&#x27;t buy if your hair is thick because these extensions are super thin</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I needed them for! Nobody could even tell I had fake hair in!</li>
    <li> Alright, packaging was TOO SMALL, IT CAME FOLDED??? LOL??? (&gt;__&gt;) (?__?) But other than that, it came on time. Getting to the hair, the hair extensions aren&#x27;t even double weft, they&#x27;re only one weft. The hairs are too thin, and THESE AREN&#x27;T REMY HAIR! REMY HAIR DOESN&#x27;T CRISP AND MAKE THE HAIRS STICK TOGETHER WHEN YOU&#x27;RE CURLING/STRAIGHTENING! You can even tell from the beginning just by opening them that they aren&#x27;t going too last. LADIES! IF YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO PURCHASE THESE, PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SPEND A LITTLE MORE. Not only that, if you&#x27;re trying to get a full look you literally need like 2-4 packets to get a full look. Straightening and curling them was a hassle. It wouldn&#x27;t curl right even below heat of 140, and straightening them made them turn nappy. I constantly had to keep brushing when I tried to curl because it would get all crispy and nasty looking. (I got so mad because it would ruin the curls.) Regardless, they&#x27;re not even good and they don&#x27;t straighten/ curl right. Over all, they get stuck together and they end up looking like dreads, they clump up and you constantly have to brush them. The nappy-ness is too real. Seriously, I kind&#x27;ve regret buying these, but I thought I was going to get a good deal. THIS IS JUST NOT GOOD!</li>
    <li> These are great for adding length to your short hair its quick and easy and I need that being an on the go mom. I would recommend these to anyone who is considering them .</li>
    <li> they dont feel all that healthy, and tend to feel like they have some fake hair in mixed with them rather then it all being 100%</li>
    <li> The extensions were very thin &amp; shed alot. I conditioned the hair and used volumizer hoping that would help but, sadly it did not.</li>
    <li> Yes the extensions are kind of thin which made me hesitate to by them. My hair pretty full so I basically just needed something for its length. I am glad I bought these. It barely gets tangled and it curls fine, but I wear my hair wavy just they are braided most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;Concern:&lt;br /&gt;one of the one piece clips didn&#x27;t snap probably but I&#x27;m glad it came with extra clips, I just had to re-sew it (which was simple)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my daughter and she loves it. I ordered two packs because I just didn&#x27;t know if one would be enough. One would work for most. It&#x27;s easy to put in and it&#x27;s real hair not synthetic. And the shipping was really fast.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom she needed and she ordered it she said she didn&#x27;t like but its alright.</li>
    <li> Very great for the price! the extensions were full and very thick. well worth the price I consider this a steal! I buy extensions all the time and this is by far one of the best companies I bought from</li>
    <li> Love the quality and the nice touch of a free gift. Will defo use the seller again. I mixed this color in with extentions i had already and they look great!. Thank you :)</li>
    <li> I bought the wrong length, but the extensions feel really soft and are super easy to clip in. This time I&#x27;ll buy the right length and be more than happy :)</li>
    <li> I love the length of these extensions and the color is very natural.  I have medium brown hair and these blended in super well.  The clips were pretty easy for me but I kind of took my time and played around with it for a while till I got comfortable enough with them. I like the fact that you could use a curling iron or straightener on them. It made my hair look fuller and beautiful.  I love the feel of these because it felt just like my own hair. They also were not heavy some extensions  have given me a headache because the weight is so bad that it makes my head hurt by the end of the day.  These are good quality hair pieces that are so versitile. The length allows  you to do a lot with them as far as styling options. These will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got these free or at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased feedback</li>
    <li> Awesome i love them and so does my husband</li>
    <li> Love them!! They curl easy and look great!! Great quality especially for the price!! Will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Did not get here in the estimated time, I have fine hair and wanted to get more confidence, instead I felt like a sucker. So I will spend the extra money to get someone who will deliver and appreciate my business.</li>
    <li> Pros: Great shipping time, soft and silky, color as seen in picture, clips in easily without showing the clips through natural hair, helpful customer service, comes with care instructions.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Hair is pretty thin, a couple of silver hairs (I cut them off), clips are somewhat itchy.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, worth the price. You should buy 2-3 packages if you have thick hair, or you may be dissapointed. I don&#x27;t have super thick hair, so it blended well with mine.</li>
    <li> the extensions are really nice, the only thing is they are thin so you may want to order 2 but other wise they are really nice and less expensive than stores</li>
    <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t mind these extensions, but they don&#x27;t last long. They&#x27;re good for maybe a season, but once they go bad, just dump them. I would (if I were you) reinforce the clips and by the closest match to your hair. They don&#x27;t take to dye really well.</li>
    <li> blended and color matched pretty well, i get many compliments 😄 only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t feel like real hair, kinda coarse like barbie hair or something... I want to dye them but I&#x27;m worried it might damage them 😣</li>
    <li> The extensions match my hair perfectly and are in great condition. They shipped faster than expected. Can&#x27;t get much better than that. I love them! Thanks</li>
