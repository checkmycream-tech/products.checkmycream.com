      <li>They are comfortable and don&#x27;t snag my hair either.  </li>
      <li>That made me upset because I didn&#x27;t sign up for free advertising and it looks tacky.</li>

      <li>many thanks</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re soo gentle on my hair and they make super cute bracelets.</li>
      <li>very nice stuff just as expected</li>
      <li>The ends are crisp and have not frayed, and the knots are secure.</li>
      <li>and I will definitely be ordering more!</li>
      <li>I recieved a good variety of solid colors and prints and shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>I am in my twenties so some of the more wild ones I may not use</li>
      <li>They work well and are in fact worth 4$ a peice..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using one right now as a matter of fact.</li>
      <li>I ordered two brands at the same time, and these are much better quality</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with these and plan on wearing them all at least once.  </li>
      <li>All the colors are pretty too(:</li>
      <li>so exciting getting all the new designs!  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for toddler hair not too big or too small!</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>I love all the colors and they are nice just like the expensive one you would get at anthropologie.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>The ring is small and good for the toddler and young kids.</li>
      <li>I actually ordered another bag and it had a bunch more different designs</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend getting this product</li>
      <li>I just have 4 stars for now until I have more knowledge of how well they work so in a few days</li>
      <li>I was worried it would be all the same colors and without any fun designs</li>
      <li>Normal</li>
      <li>A lot of cute hair ties for very little $.  </li>
      <li>rubber bands, I prefer these by far  </li>
      <li>but so far this hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend these bands over others that have frayed and stretched out.</li>
      <li>I want to have them in the entire spectrum :) My only complaint is that the product description said there would be no duplicates</li>
      <li>But my daughter has very straight hair so after a few uses they tend to slide lower on her pony tail.  </li>
      <li>But never again...it does not take much effort to make these and half inch elastic is elastic</li>

<li> I received 10 solid color bands in assorted colors and 10 other bands from patterned to lace to braided.</li>
<li> I should have gotten the 50-pack!  Was worried about color fastness on wet hair</li>
<li> , the ends look like they have been sealed to prevent fraying---whereas the other ones haven&#x27;t.</li>
<li> and I got about three black ties...</li>
<li> I HAVE EXTREMLY THICK LONG HAIR</li>
<li> No need to waste my money.</li>
<li> and that&#x27;s small potatoes and black</li>
<li> It is difficult to find hair bands that hold it without falling out all the time.  </li>
<li> but I was wrong!</li>
<li> They can dress up a boring ponytail.</li>

    <li> Great value.  Love the variety!</li>
    <li> This was a great assortment.  I should have gotten the 50-pack!  Was worried about color fastness on wet hair but so far this hasn&#x27;t been a problem.  These make great party favors.</li>
    <li> They are very nice and cool looking !! But they stretch a bit over time...  Normal i guess. Sofia loves them...</li>
    <li> Great product and Vendor!  My daughter and I have long hair and these hair ties do their job without headaches and hair creases.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also wears them on her wrist, as a bracelet.  I highly recommend them!</li>
    <li> Lots of cute colors and prints came in my grab bag.  I&#x27;m happy with these and plan on wearing them all at least once.  Except the animal prints.  I don&#x27;t do animal print.  Ever.</li>
    <li> I ordered these from Amazon because boutiques are charging $20 or more for 5-10 of them so this was the best price and quanity.  I recieved a good variety of solid colors and prints and shipping was fast.  If I ever need more, I will order from Lucky Girl!</li>
    <li> A lot of cute hair ties for very little $.  Good for your hair and adorable patterns.  I would recommend buying these.  They last for a long time.</li>
    <li> These hair ties are wonderful.  Although they do stretch out a bit faster than &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; rubber bands, I prefer these by far  They don&#x27;t snag my hair at all which is wonderful.</li>
    <li> very nice stuff just as expected</li>
    <li> Never again will i pay 4$ a peice for these things.. They work well and are in fact worth 4$ a peice.. But sence finding them here for way cheaper.. No need to waste my money. They are excellent and we will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> These are great, I have a lot of hair that is very fine. It is difficult to find hair bands that hold it without falling out all the time.

    <li> so exciting getting all the new designs!  I actually ordered another bag and it had a bunch more different designs</li>
    <li> Good hair tires. The ring is small and good for the toddler and young kids. I would recommend this product to the friends.</li>
    <li> These are great, the sparkly ones I got are my favorites though! Great selection and work very well. Happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> Not quite as pictured</li>
    <li> These are so cute and you get a lot for the money. I prefer these sorts of hair ties because they don&#x27;t break or pull out my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with the product itself and the variation of the grab bag. I received 10 solid color bands in assorted colors and 10 other bands from patterned to lace to braided. The ends are crisp and have not frayed, and the knots are secure. I highly recommend these bands over others that have frayed and stretched out.</li>
    <li> Love these for my hair.</li>
    <li> nice product-very pleased with purchase</li>
    <li> Nice variety of patterns.  Easy to wear in hair and/or around wrist. Didnt give a 5 bc they do get stretched out after several uses.  But my daughter has very straight hair so after a few uses they tend to slide lower on her pony tail.  she doesnt seem to mind.  She just switches them from wrist to hair:)  I have heard you can wash to tighten back up but we tend to lose them before they can make it to the washer.</li>
    <li> These are great!!!!! I love all the colors and they are nice just like the expensive one you would get at anthropologie.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for these hair ties in a larger package but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for brands like twistband. These are great quality and had a great variety of colors. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> They were all cute delivered before the estimated dates i absolutely love them!</li>
    <li> THESE HAIT TIES ARE GREAT! I HAVE EXTREMLY THICK LONG HAIR AND THEY HOLD PERFECTLY WITH NO CREASE! WILL BE BUYING MORE SOON!</li>
    <li> But never again...it does not take much effort to make these and half inch elastic is elastic so I am ordering two packs and saving over one hundred fifty dollars...amazon has it all at great prices....many thanks</li>
    <li> Perfect size for toddler hair not too big or too small!</li>
    <li> I bought these hair ties awhile back.  Just getting to writing the review.  These hair ties were great and of good quality.  I would recommend them without a doubt.</li>
    <li> Love, love the grab bag!! My daughter loves having a big selection! This is our go to hair band. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the colors and quality of the hair ties that I received. They work great on my hair and don&#x27;t cause as much creasing or breaking as elastics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off ... I receive THREE bands with &amp;#34;Lucky Girl &amp;#60;3&amp;#34; branded on the side. That made me upset because I didn&#x27;t sign up for free advertising and it looks tacky.</li>
    <li> I just got these yesterday. Took them about 13 days to get here. I&#x27;m using one right now as a matter of fact. They seem sturdy enough and I have thicker hair. I just have 4 stars for now until I have more knowledge of how well they work so in a few days I will come back and see how I feel. They came in nice packaging. All of them there plus the color of the year for 2013. They are inexpensive which is nice also. All the colors are pretty too(:</li>
    <li> I was worried it would be all the same colors and without any fun designs but I was wrong! Super buy and a very good selection! I will likely be doing these as graduation gifts!</li>
    <li> These are really cute hairties - Comes with a variety or different colors. They can dress up a boring ponytail. I am in my twenties so some of the more wild ones I may not use but I know these would be great for children and teens.</li>
    <li> The set of ties I received aren&#x27;t patterned like in the photo, but they&#x27;re still adorable. They&#x27;re soo gentle on my hair and they make super cute bracelets.</li>
    <li> Nice set of hair ties - my daughter and I will share these.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I am so excited about these hairties. I have been struggling for my entire life to find a product that will stay in my difficult-to-tame hair and these have stayed put ALL DAY LONG!! So of course I have placed another order - I want to have them in the entire spectrum :) My only complaint is that the product description said there would be no duplicates and I got about three black ties... but it&#x27;s a grab bag and that&#x27;s small potatoes and black goes with everything anyway. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I love these hair ties and the assortment of colors! They are cheap to make, but you can&#x27;t get this kind of assortment when you make them unless you want to make a ton!  Great buy!!</li>
