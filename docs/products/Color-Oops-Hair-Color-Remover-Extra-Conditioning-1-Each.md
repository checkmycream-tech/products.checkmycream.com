      <li>gave this product 3 stars because: 1) i know people who have used it and have had a great deal of success with it.</li>
      <li>And, I&#x27;m very happy with it because the ends are now brown, rather than the blue-black they&#x27;d stayed from the old semi-perm.</li>
      <li>I had to do this in my bathroom because I needed good light and a mirror.</li>
      <li>The stylist knew I wasn&#x27;t very happy with it, but I thought that I would live with it for a day and see if I \\&quot;grew to love it\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very Happy with this product, it took out a lot of my black hair out, I was happy with the out look..</li>
      <li>oops turned it a very light orange-brown.</li>
      <li>Rinsing is very important aparently.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for over 20 years and have been using Nice n Easy for about 8 years.)</li>
      <li>Remember, the more you wash and rinse the better it works.</li>
      <li>(I wore a hood into Walgreens:)</li>
      <li>but I cannot emphasize how much better</li>
      <li>Like magic</li>
      <li>There are better ways to test products than using consumers as guinea pigs.</li>
      <li>Then I did it again about two more times.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to add another color on top.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m so glad this product exists so that I can fry my hair</li>
      <li>My color is now a lovely medium brown and I will be using a Neutral Protein Filler before coloring my hair again.  </li>
      <li>so it was more like a chocolate cherry</li>
      <li>I will probably do it one more time after the color on the top starts to fade</li>
      <li>I wash my hair more and more color</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t find the smell as offensive as many others did.  </li>
      <li>I checked as many reviews</li>
      <li>/&gt;After applying the product ( they don’t want it on your head more than 20  minutes )</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>And each and every time I wash it it becomes more</li>
      <li>God bless my husband, he thought I was cute..</li>
      <li>I found the many recommendations for Color Oops.  </li>
      <li>I stopped lightening my hair about 3 years ago, which was what made me feel better about using Oops</li>
      <li>It was a great non-traumatizing step in my quest to go much lighter.</li>

      <li>I am SO pleased I decided to use this product.  </li>
      <li>I was satisfied but not \\&quot;wowed.\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I tried everything I could think of to fade it, and eventually in desperation I touched up the top of my head to even it all out.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have dark brown hair that I dye a bit darker every once in a while to counter-act lightening from the sun or just to make it more dramatic.  Yesterday I chose a brown-black color and it turned out 100% solid black.  It was so unnatural looking with the rest of my coloring, it looked like I was wearing a terrible wig.  My boyfriend consoled me, said it wasn&#x27;t that bad, that I just needed to get used to it, but I woke up this morning and couldn&#x27;t stand looking at myself.  I went and bought Color Oops, left it on for about 16 minutes, and now my hair is free of black dye, but is not back to my original color.  I would call it a \\&quot;rich golden brown,\\&quot; a little lighter than my natural shade with red and gold undertones.  Not my ideal hair color, but 100x better than black.  I&#x27;ve decided not to put dye on top of it, just because I can live with this shade and I have now learned the hard way that there are some shades I can&#x27;t live with.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dark brown but I decided to dye it Black. Hated the color, so I tried color oops. Turned my naturally brown hair ORANGE.    BUT, if you plan on redying it right away, this will work perfectly. Just remember to choose a color slightly lighter that the color you want because after color oops your hair becomes porous and your new hair color appears darker than it normally would.</li>
    <li> About a month ago I decided to turn my dark dishwater blonde hair brown.. I chose a nice color med golden brown thinking it will just get darker. I didn&#x27;t take into account the fact that my hair is highlighted with blonde brown and red coloring. The dye took to the red and gave me a yucky rusty reddish brown. It clashed completely with my skin. I did have the good sense to use semi permanent so it was a just a matter of time till it washed out, but it has been taking forever to fade so I bought the color oops in regular strenght (i have short hair and figured dark blonde to brown wasn&#x27;t worth the extra strength). I did the strand test and allergy test the day before, and today I used it. I have a short bob hairstyle so I only used half the application bottle. I combed through and put on the supplied shower cap and left it on for 20 mins exactly. I shampooed 3 times, and let the hot water rinse my hair for at least 20 mins, and then i used the deep conditioner i had left over from the dye i used last month. My hair isn&#x27;t exactly the shade it was, infact the red is a little bit stronger then it was in my orignal color, but color oops did rinse out the majority of the dye. prob a few moore weeks of normal washing should fade out the rest of the red thats in there. But overall i&#x27;m happy with the results it gave me. I definately think if anyone has what happened to me happen to them give color oops a try. It worked very well for me, and my hair with all the mixture of colors i didn&#x27;t expect as good of results as i got.</li>
    <li> I was very nervous about using Color Oops because I had never heard of a non-damaging product that could do this but I was very pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s a synopsis of my story: I decided about 6 months ago to stop coloring my hair, I had been coloring my hair since I was 15 and I am now almost 25.  I stopped lightening my hair about 3 years ago, which was what made me feel better about using Oops because I read reviews that if you have lightened you hair it could come out orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So about a week ago I decided I was bored with my natural color (always a bad start to changing my hair) and wanted to go back to the \\&quot;sexy\\&quot; black hair I had over the summer.  Well one main thing has changed since then, I&#x27;m not tan, and black hair made me look terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading practically every review on the web for Color Oops, I decided to take this risk because I simply could not stand my hair.  Since my hair is naturally light brown with reddish tones I figured I would be a good candidate for Oops working well on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is long and you will end up in a cold shower, but rinse the full time! The smell is not nearly as bad as people claim, I barely noticed it and the rinsing/washing washed the smell away completely.  I did a strand test and decided to leave Oops in for 17 minutes, a bit less that the full time as I was afraid if getting too light.  It worked amazingly! My hair doesn&#x27;t feel damaged at all and the color is so close to my natural it is like I didn&#x27;t color my hair at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is awesome, it is affordable and it works! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but after realizing how important it was for me to read them, I decided I&#x27;d share my great story for anyone who is nervous.  (I didn&#x27;t even buy from Amazon because I didn&#x27;t want to wait:))</li>
    <li> I started with dark brown, wanted light brown. Used oops, my hair turned ugly orange. Recolored it to light brown, according to oops instructions, left on for 5 min only........... My hair turned black. My hair is darker than what I started with. Very dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I used this product after I&#x27;d colored my hair red with a semi-permanent color, then tried to correct the horrible orange result by dying over it with a light blond permanent color. Needless to say the results were a disaster.I was sort of striped orange, and yellow! I have very fine hair, and this product took out every stitch of red color in under 10 minutes. I washed twice, kept rinsing, and then conditioned twice with an intense conditioner. The results are really good. I&#x27;m back to being a pale blonde, no need to even recolor. Best 15 minutes I&#x27;ve spent on my hair for a while!!!</li>
    <li> Hi all, I will make this brief. I have light strawberry/blonde hair, with repeated blonde highlights. My hair was pretty much fried. Anyway, I got bored with keeping up with the hightlights, so thought I would do a natural instincts lightest brown/ red... WRONG decision! It was dark red/purple/brown... hideous! God bless my husband, he thought I was cute..it looked dark like when we were dating. BUT, 15 years later, it doesnt look so good anymore!!! Anyway, I have done this before, and usually go to the salon to have it fixed (you would think I would learn, but no!)... but the last time I went it cost me $200 to fix, and I dont have that to pay. sooooo... went online, and read literally over a hundred reviews....and with fear and trembling bought color oops. I thought I would be the 1% that has her hair fall out... yet I was desperate (or a sick thrill seeker) I still washed my hair with dish soap, soaked it in hot olive oil, used dandruff shampoo, the whole bit, but the color wouldnt budge. sooo... I mixed the color oops, did a strand test (acutally 2, one from the back of my head, and one from the front, just in case). Figured out my time, and then, shaking, I slathered her on my whole head. The stuff is runny, and yup, very stinky, but not much worse than a salon. Those who say it is unbearable have never sat in a salon for 4 hours getting their hair done... Anyway, I combed it through with a wide comb, for probably half of the time it was in, then when time was up, I washed, washed washed. Then conditioned the heck out of it. Rinsing is very important aparently. Well, I let it air dry ( I was afraid of heat damage) and ....tada! The burgandy was gone, and I was left with a nice, even color, and my HIGHTLIGHTS were still there! I have never been so relieved to see blonde! It isnt exactly the same color, but close enought, with no purple to be found, and I really like it. Oh, also, even though my hair was parched, it looks pretty good, and did not fall out, and looks no worse for the wear. I can not tell you how happy I am about this, and i would not hesitate to use it again. It is a bit runny and stinky, but soooo worth it! Good luck, and dont forget to rinse the heck out of it, thats how the color gets off your hair after it shrinks. Blessings!</li>
    <li> Not the original color, but lighter and orange...</li>
    <li> I accidentally dyed my hair almost black 2 weeks before my wedding, tried to dye over it to no avail. rather than go to a salon and spend $$$ on a bleach job, i tried color oops. it took the color right out even though the dye was over a week old. downsides are that now i cant really dye my hair as the dye wont stay, but now that the wedding is over i dont mind just letting it grow out. it also left my roots an orange color that i also cant dye over so i have an orange ring growing out of my scalp right now, but i put highlights in to blend it and you can hardly notice. my hair was dry for awhile after i used color oops but is now (about 2 mos later) back to normal. if you need something in a pinch to fix a color mistake this product really works, however i wouldnt recommend using it just because you feel like you need a change because it will damage your hair!</li>
    <li> I recently wanted to color my hair the color of my roots which was a light brown and the rest of my hair was lighter brown/blondish. I bought the same all over color from Loreal that I always get but this time my hair turned out really dark ash brown. I hated it! I tried washing it with dawn dish washing liquid, then I tried powdered tide and clarifying shampoo, nothing worked. A coworker suggested color oops and I read up on it, bought 2 boxes cause my hair is a few inches past my shoulders and then I waited a few more days because I was scared to use the color oops. I thought it might make my hair orange and that I would have to recolor it immediately. Well i finally used it last night and while it STINKS pretty bad, overall it wasn&#x27;t such a big deal. I put it in my hair (its kinda watery), waited 20 minutes with a plastic bag on my hair, then rinsed it in the shower, washed my hair with shampoo, rinsed again, re-washed with shampoo and then rinsed my hair for 20 minutes. I just sat down in the tub and kept the water as hot as I could stand it until I no longer had any hot water ha ha. Then I got out, put some serious conditioner in my hair and put a towel on my head and went to bed. I woke up and go it in the shower and rinsed the conditioner out and surprise! All the color is gone! AND my hair is the color I was shooting for in the first place! I am amazed. Seriously, if you mess up your hair color, this is the way to go! If you do recolor it after you use color oops make sure to get a few shades lighter than normal because color oops makes your hair porous so the color will really grab and it will be too dark all over again. Also the 20 minutes of rinsing with warm/hot water is a must.Just follow the directions!</li>
    <li> I am 53 and dyed my hair with a Loreal light brown permanent color. The color grabbed (it was the foam style dye) and the result was almost black hair color. I purchased the Color Oops color remover and followed the directions completely. After I rinsed and shampooed, I towel dried the hair and found that it had not only removed all color, but also bleached my hair up to a fakey dyed over processed blonde color that is not my own color. I am a naturally a medium brown color with a few grays cropping up on the top. The directions read that rinsing and rinsing is the \\&quot;key\\&quot; to color removal. I am not sorry I used the product, but am thinking that if one has already over-processed or porous hair and the color you being removed is only a day or so old (as mine was) - really watch the level of color removal as it is processing. I do not know if I should have left it on the entire 20 minutes or shortened the time-or if I should have shampooed and rinsed[[ASIN:B0012JY4G4 Color Oops Hair Color Remover, Extra Strength 1 Application]] less...just a warning....the stuff really does remove the color and maybe more of your own natural color and just keeps lifting and bleaching it out...I do recommend it though-it does the job</li>
    <li> Never use it! It works okay, but it smells like sulfur for days! I am extremely disappointed with it. I tryed evrything to get it out, shampoo, vinegar, olive oil, and even ketchup. Nothing worked.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re reading this review it&#x27;s probably too late to follow my advice: DO NOT USE CLAIROL HAIR DYE FOAM! I recently used the new Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy foam (I&#x27;ve been using their regular color for a number of years without issues) and what was supposed to be a medium brown turned my hair black.  I have pale skin so I looked like death warmed up!  I tried re-dying my hair back to the medium golden brown I initially wanted but my hair remained black.  I lived with this new color for 2 days until I could take no more so after a web search I found the many recommendations for Color Oops.  I checked as many reviews as I could before going ahead because I was very concerned that my hair could take no more being messed with and I&#x27;d end up with no hair at all!    I wasn&#x27;t sure whether to purchase the extra or regular strength (the info on the box doesn&#x27;t give much indication which way to go), so decided to go with the regular strength, with the thought process that I could always step up to the extra strength if the regular didn&#x27;t work.  I am SO pleased I decided to use this product.  I followed the instructions completely.  Once applied, it is really important to keep checking your hair because I found my hair was already changing to my original golden brown within 10 minutes so I decided to begin washing it out at that point instead of waiting the full 20 minutes.  Even though the rinsing seemed to take forever, it was definitely more than worth it.    I feel like me again and with tomorrow being Christmas Day and expecting lots of company, it couldn&#x27;t have come sooner!</li>
    <li> Like many of the previous reviewers, I turned to Color Oops after an unexpected color disaster, and I am very pleased with the results.     Background: I have been coloring my hair for years to cover gray. Usually I go with a cool medium brown that matches my true color pretty well. This time, I had decided to try a slightly (slightly!!!) warmer shade, on the advice of my stylist... you can guess the result. Not only did the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; turn out to pull a shocking purplish-red, but my hair grabbed the color so that I had purplish-red roots and nearly black tips - not a look that worked well for someone of my age and Scandinavian-pale complexion. So, I bought, and used, Color Oops to undo the mess. This is the third time since this product came out that I&#x27;ve used it, with really good results each time.    I won&#x27;t go over the same ground that everyone else has already stated - but I have a few points to add:    1.  Don&#x27;t panic. Most really bad hair decisions are made while panicking, need I say more?    2.  DO do the strand test. A caution about strands: most of us, if we do it at all, will instinctively take our strand from the nape of the neck, where it won&#x27;t show as much that we cut some hair there. But the nape of your neck is generally where the least-damaged, least sun-exposed, least product-enhanced hair is, and a strand test there will not tell you what a product will do to the sprayed, moussed, sun-washed, blow-dried crown of your head. TAKE THE STRAND FROM THE MOST DAMAGED HAIR YOU HAVE!    3. As the package says, timing and temperature are really, really important with Color Oops. Time carefully and have the room warm.    4. Others have mentioned how important the rinsing is, and they&#x27;re right. Don&#x27;t short-change the rinse times! I use a music cd to time the rinse and make it more enjoyable - when the last track starts, I know my 20 minute first rinse is done.    5. Texture matters - my hair is thick but very fine, and colored but never bleached, and so I need to work the product through really well, but my hair doesn&#x27;t need the full 20 minutes.      6. Read the package insert carefully, and know going in that what this product will do is to lift the artificial color, revealing whatever the LIGHTEST color is for your underlying hair. Translation: if you&#x27;ve never used bleach, you&#x27;ll get back to close to your natural color. If you&#x27;ve been a double-process blonde in the past, you will end up with the hideous orange that several people complained about, because that&#x27;s what your bleached hair looks like under the synthetic colors that have been added to it. It&#x27;s not Color Oops that gave you the orange - the orange is the only color that&#x27;s there underneath the dye, and so you&#x27;ll need to tone or re-dye after Color Oops to get where you want to be.     7. Know that Color Oops comes in two strengths - Regular, and Extra Strength. Make sure to get the one you really need.    8. When you are done, if your results look lighter at first than you expected, Don&#x27;t Panic. Ten minutes after I stepped out of the shower I had carroty blonde hair that positively gleamed in its outrageous brightness! But by the next morning, the color had oxidized and settled to something just a little lighter than my natural color, and over the next 24 hours it settled a bit more. So give it enough time to see the real results - don&#x27;t panic, and don&#x27;t succumb to the temptation to re-dye right over your freshly Oops&#x27;d hair.     Good luck all!</li>
    <li> So I wanted to put a little red in my hair, I bought a light auburn, once i used it, i realized my hair didnt look any different, so that day I went out and bought a Medium Rich Auburn. (BAD IDEA) my hair turned a burgundy red, I was mortified. The next morning I went and got a brown and put it on hoping to tone it down. Then it was brown with red tones, and was extremely patchy and uneven. My only hope was \\&quot;Color Oops\\&quot; I bought a box of Color Oops and bought a box of Light Golden brown to put back on my hair afterwards. I was so worried my hair was going to fall out due to all the coloring. However, I used AMMONIA FREE color, and conditioned my hair SEVERAL TIMES! So I prayed it wouldnt fall out once I used the color oops. I put the color oops on my hair, followed the directions to a T. Rinsed for 20 minutes etc. It looked really blondish at first, but then I put some conditioner on it, let it sit for 30 minutes, rinsed it, and then dried it and it darkened up on its own. Now its a pretty blondish brown color and I love it. What a life saver Color Oops was... It was a rough 24hrs. but in the end all was okay :-)   \\&quot;</li>
    <li> I love this product, it has saved me many times and don&#x27;t blame it always on the product. I go to beauty school and it really is the easiest thing to do without spending a lot of money or having to bleach it out in the salon. (I would know, i am at one 5 days a week...) Basically it has to all do with chemistry. The color or colors you had on before will be pulled out when using this product and you MAY not get the color you thought you were but that will only be because of the the molecules in your hair/mixed with the remains of the dye and this product formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recently used it on my natural/red/dark brown messed up dye job and it turned my hair like a strawberry blonde. I wasn&#x27;t upset because for one, it was ALL one color and at least now i can more easily get it to one solid color then all the old colors fading out. I also usually use the extra strength but have used the regular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus by using this you are saving your hair A LOT of damage. This product is gentle and with the right conditioner and following the directions, your hair could possibly even feel SOFTER. On the directions it does say.. DO NOT USE WITH COOL COLORS like pink/blue/green... so keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like how color oops \\&quot;colored\\&quot; your hair then just go to the salon and since this product \\&quot;strips\\&quot; it, it will be a lot easier for the person who is coloring your hair to get your hair back to one solid - \\&quot;standable\\&quot; looking color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoped this helped!</li>
    <li> When I colored, the color was way too dark for me, so I bought a box of Color Oops a few days later. It&#x27;s my own damn fault that I didn&#x27;t do a patch test, but I&#x27;ve never had sensitive skin, never had a problem with dyes causing an allergic reaction.  But do I ever wish I had done the patch test!  The product worked well and did just what it said it would do.  But the next morning I woke up with what looked like bug bites by one ear.  As the day wore on, my eyes swelled up, the \\&quot;bug bites\\&quot; got bigger and redder and finally burst and bled.  By the next day I knew it wasn&#x27;t bug bites because it was all around my hairline, behind my ears, on my chest ... in exactly the pattern you&#x27;d expect suds and water to run down your body in the shower.  So I showered and shampooed another twenty minutes - and it stunk just as bad as it did the first time AND released more of the chemicals over my body.  Now with blisters in places you don&#x27;t want to know about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did two days of Benadryl cream, tried Cortaid cream, took Benadryl at bedtime, but the blisters just kept spreading, popping, then bleeding.  Today my very sympathetic husband suggested we finally go to the free-standing emergency room in our city, and it didn&#x27;t take much convincing.  I was itching like crazy and looked like I&#x27;d been in a car wreck.  As soon as I told the doctor about using the Color Oops and he examined me, he wrote me a prescription for twelve days of steroid treatment plus a prescription for heavy-duty steroid cream to try to heal the blisters and hopefully stave off infection.  Yes, I should have done the patch test.  Or I should have done the half-hour shampoo and rinse over the kitchen sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my hair looks good.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, it works good but it stinks really bad!! Like old eggs, and dirty diapers! Honestly don&#x27;t recommend it if you can&#x27;t stand bad smell!!! But if you wanna try it, then do it outside because it will stink for a day or two...</li>
    <li> I went to my hair dresser and wanted her to dye my hair dark Brown, she did. But the color grabbed and came out BLACK..I&#x27;m 55...lol..black is not cool ! So after some research on line, I purchased Color OOPS. I cant believe with 1 application this product removed every trace of permanent Black hair color. It left my hair just as it was before I got it colored. Amazing stuff. I highly recommend it to anyone ! Just follow the directions and rinse, rinse, rinse. Love it !</li>
    <li> First off, this product worked for me as advertized, I didn&#x27;t even need to leave it on for the full 20 minutes.  Worth every penny.  Just one small additional point to make, when it comes to the instructions, who can rinse their hair for 20 mintues and not run out of hot water in the shower?!  Or if you are rinsing in the kitchen sink, who can bend over for that long without a back ache? (Just a point of practicallity.)  Overall, great product when you&#x27;ve made some poor color choices and you need a fix quickly, it&#x27;s a life saver!  :-)</li>
    <li> I recently used this product to remove black dye from my son&#x27;s hair. It only removed some of the color and left it reddish brown instead of anything close to his correct color</li>
    <li> Did not damage hair, but not all the color was removed. Overall did a good job though.</li>
    <li> I was one of poor schnooks who got suckered into trying Clairol&#x27;s new Nice &#x27; Easy Color Blend Foam.  Sadly, I&#x27;ll try almost anything for free.  Take it from me...you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;The foam didn&#x27;t...no matter how hard or long I shook the bottle (as per the directions). The bottle was slippery, the color immediately stained my hairline and did not wipe off like the original Nice &#x27; Easy does.  In the past when I got some drops of product on my sink or floor I was able to remove it, even hours later.  Now I have stains which I can&#x27;t remove, no matter which solutions I try. The \\&quot;foam\\&quot;, actually a runny substance, was difficult to apply evenly.  (Bear in mind I&#x27;m not a novice at this.  I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for over 20 years and have been using Nice n Easy for about 8 years.) There is no way to use the foam for a roots only application; in fact the directions don&#x27;t even address this as an option. I didn&#x27;t find the smell as offensive as many others did.  As usual, I left the color in for only 20 minutes.  When I attempted to rinse it out, my hair became stiff and matted, making it very difficult to get my fingers through it. I applied the packet of conditioner (note:  it&#x27;s impossible to get open in the shower with your bare hands.  Apologies to my dentist:  I used my teeth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I removed the towel, I knew I was in trouble.  The front of my hair, to which I first applied the solution, was near black, the rest a very, very dark brown.  The color I used was number 5, described as Medium Brown.  I tried all sorts of solutions:  rewashing my hair with regular shampoo, using Dawn Dishwashing detergent (11 times in 2 days), washing with Prell (known as a harsh detergent shampoo).  After 2 days I called Clairol&#x27;s toll free number and spoke with a Customer Service Rep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service was very sympathetic and told me the only way to remove the too dark color was to strip my hair, using Born Blonde Original Hair Lightener.  I was told to apply it one inch away from my roots until the hair became a red-brown color and then apply it to my roots, allowing the hair to lighten to a pumpkin color, then rinse and shampoo.  Only then could I apply new color (this time number 114 - Natural Light Ash Brown), mixing one part color with one part developer and one part shampoo, leaving it on between 5 and 20 minutes.  I was not to use any other coloring product for 4 weeks.  (No, my memory is not that great - I took copious notes and had the rep hold on until I read this all back to her.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was by sheer luck that I found out about Color Oops and I thank my lucky stars that I did.  There was a dollar off coupon in the Sunday paper and I researched like mad to find out if this product was any good.  As for most products, there were good and bad reviews, and I decided to take a chance for one main reason:  Color Oops contains no ammonia or peroxide, just a solution formulated to lift the color from the hair shaft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You MUST follow the instructions to the letter.  Yes, 20 minutes is a long time to rinse.  Yes, unless you use warm water and stay in a warm room the product won&#x27;t work properly.  Yes, I read the reviews in which people said that the next morning their hair was back to it&#x27;s original and awful color.  (That&#x27;s why I waited to post a review until the second day, when I washed my hair again.)  Yes, a good conditioner is a must.  (Yes, this is an awfully long review!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upshot is that Color Oops will work if you follow the instructions.  My hair will continue to need deep conditioning for a while, but I&#x27;m happy.  My color is now a lovely medium brown and I will be using a Neutral Protein Filler before coloring my hair again.  This will fill the hair shaft and prevent the hair from being too porous and absorbing too much color.  I&#x27;ll be using a lighter color than I usually do.  I&#x27;ll also still be using Nice &#x27;n Easy, but not the Color Blend Foam.  Avoid the foam like the plague!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve commented many times on Clairol&#x27;s Facebook page and also on their website.  I monitored both for about a week, curious to see customer reaction.  Much of it was negative.

    <li> On a budget as we all are and have been dying my hair at home for a number of years.  I was tired of blonde, so I dyed it strawberry blond from an online offer.  Looked good.  Roots came in and I tried to match my color from a  box at the store.  Big Mistake!  My hair turned hot-red, a&#x27;la Ronald Mc Donald.  I am pale-skinned and I looked like a child wearing a horrible wig.  I started this at 10:00 pm  and now it was nearly 12:00.  I washed my hair once w/ dish soap and three times w/powdered laundry soap (Tide w/ Bleach).  The water kept running red in the tub, so I thought it was making a difference... No.  I went googling and found out about this product and read favorable reviews.  I went and checked my local 24 hour Walgreens and they had it in stock.  I bought 2 boxes of the extra strength as I have a ton of long, curly hair that I thought I had just ruined.  I followed the directions to a tee.  I did the strand test and couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes... the hair was blonde again!  I completed the rest of my head and I am so happy I could cry.  I wish I knew how to post pictures on this thing to show you what a miracle this product is.  The only thing is  I missed a spot by my hairline and had to do that little part again, so be careful you get all of it covered.  It is now 2:40 am and my nightmare is over.  I can go out in public again (I wore a hood into Walgreens:)</li>
    <li> I have natural blonde hair ant dyed it auburn. Unfortunately it turned out too dark so I bought color oops. After reading so many reviews I was  a bit anxious and had mixed feelings... But I thought it would be fine if I would follow the directions to pinpoint. Well.... that did not turn out so well... although there is no dark auburn anymore after the application of color oops my hair was back to blonde with a very brassy/ orange tone. That was yesterday. Today I tried a second package of color oops and it&#x27;s worse.... now I&#x27;m strawberry blonde. This orange just looks hideous and I don&#x27;t know how to get rid of it.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d highlighted my mid-back-length light-brown hair for years and for the past year or so had been dyeing over it with various brown shades of Natural Instincts semi-permanent.  I also occasionally do Colour Rays or Manic Panic in the front/top areas (in streaks).  A few months ago I felt adventurous and decided to do a soft-black/dark brown (it was called Espresso) in a semi-permanent, again Natural Instincts.  I loved it at first, but it never faded or washed out of the last 8\\&quot; or so of my hair.  I tried everything I could think of to fade it, and eventually in desperation I touched up the top of my head to even it all out.  Again, that faded but the color had grabbed up 8\\&quot; from the ends and was going nowhere.  A friend suggested bleaching it but with fine, already over-processed hair, I was afraid.  I did some research and settled on Color Oops and am very glad I did.  I followed the instructions and got great results.  The ends are still quite a bit darker than the rest, so I may do another application if I decide I don&#x27;t like it...but it does look intentional.  And, I&#x27;m very happy with it because the ends are now brown, rather than the blue-black they&#x27;d stayed from the old semi-perm. color.  It&#x27;s refreshing to see my original light-brown again, from about the ears up.  I have strawberry-blond highlights throughout, which I know are leftover from Colour Rays (which does lift a bit).  My hair feels a lot less damaged than it would have if I&#x27;d bleached my ends.  For $10, this is definitely worth it.  My last salon color correction was $180 and I wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair black with Revlon Colorsilk for the past few years, but started to notice that it makes my cool toned fair skin look sickly pale, and makeup barely perks me up. My stylist, who I trust explicitly, gently suggested that a woman of 40 might want to go lighter. Point taken. At his recommendation, I saw a colorist at Antonio Prieto Salon and for an absurd amount, she gently lifted some of the black. She explained that I&#x27;d have to do this several times to slowly remove the dye without turning completely red. I refused to pay a salon to do this again, so I went to Ricky&#x27;s NYC and an awesome color expert recommended Color Oops, and sold me a cool dark brown dye by Clairol Professional, very close to my natural shade. I was petrified of a hair disaster, but determined to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the same results as other reviewers with naturally dark brown hair, dyed black, then turned brassy red by Color Oops. This product is very watery and some will squirt on the floor if you&#x27;re not careful when applying. I applied this to the entire head, focusing on the ends, since the top has newer hair that&#x27;s been virtually untouched by the previous dye. The smell is completely toxic and will linger for a day in the bathroom, and on your hair. The instructions say to rinse out for 20 minutes, which seems like too much, but it&#x27;s for good reason. This leaves a dull, greasy coating on your hair that&#x27;s difficult to comb out, so rinse extra well and use good conditioner. It feels like you stepped out of a strongly chlorinated pool.  My hair was dull, dry, and knotted for the next few days after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top of my hair was hideous red brass and the ends looked barely touched. The body of my hair had subtle streaks of red, but the results were uneven. I panicked, but assured myself that I could just dye over the red. I used Cool Dark Brown by Clairol Professional and the end result was good, but not perfect. I can still see some red on top, andam afraid it will lighten over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results seem to vary according to your natural color. If you have a hair oops, don&#x27;t panic. Just run to the top colorist in your town.</li>
    <li> I used Color Oops yesterday after dying my hair too dark ( a plummy red). Now it&#x27;s lightened to a strawberry blonde. Beware: your hair will smell like rotten eggs! I just did a deep conditioning hair mask in hopes if getting rid of the odor to no avail. Next time I&#x27;ll be going to a salon...</li>
    <li> I have very long thin brown hair. I tried out a new hair salon because I got a groupon for it. I wanted a deep brown color with rich undertones, almost purplish and red. To my disgust, I got what was nearly black and very flat in tones. I nearly cried.  The stylist knew I wasn&#x27;t very happy with it, but I thought that I would live with it for a day and see if I \\&quot;grew to love it\\&quot;.  That night I had bad dreams.  Woke up in the morning and hated it more.  I searched the web for decoloring options and found Color Oops. The reviews were mixed but I decided to take my chances.  I found it at my local Rite Aid store.  Tried a strand sample and loved it. Did the whole head next. I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t have enough application in the box, but it just barely made it. If you have thick long hair, you&#x27;ll need 2 boxes. Since my hair is very thin, I had just enough.  It&#x27;s important that you follow the directions completely. It may seem hard to bend over the tub and rinse for 15 minutes, but it&#x27;s necessary, along with the 2 shampoos and conditioning at the end. OMG, I am so impressed at by what Color Ooops did for me. It brought back my natural brown hair, plus nice highlights here and there. It even took away my grey hairs, that&#x27;s a bonus. Plus my hair is still nice and soft.  I don&#x27;t mind the foul smell so much, it&#x27;s kinda a cross between rotten eggs and grapefruit, but it&#x27;s very light and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll be gone in a couple days.  Color Oops saved me, thank you!!  My only complaint was that the gloves that were in the box were only half gloves...they didn&#x27;t open up, it was only one side of the glove. Luckily, I had another pair of gloves from an old clairol kit years back.  Lesson learned, I will never go back to that hair salon again. Good thing I only spent $30 on the groupon for it.  Color Oops works, at least it did for me :)  I used the regular strength kit, not the extra strength.</li>
    <li> I recently dyed my hair a soft black, it turned out jet black. I left it for about a month trying to get it to lighten up in between washed. It definitely wasn&#x27;t helping so I had planned on stripping my hair and re dyeing it. But instead I had found Color oops. I hadn&#x27;t realized what it was until I had gotten ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful that it had no ammonia because my hair is already damaged, but it does smell god awful, worse than bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;The mixture is somewhat harder to apply because it is so runny. I had to use 2 different treatments because my hair is very thick. It&#x27;s very inconvenient to have to rinse for around 25 minutes, but it is a very crucial step. It left my hair dryed out and brittle feeling but in much better condition than stripping and would have done.&lt;br /&gt;It left me with a very consistent, even color. I didn&#x27;t feel the need to re dye my hair afterwards. My natural hair is a light brown but it left me with a medium brown with a tint of red. I added some highlights and it turned out salon worthy, says my hair stylist. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A couple months ago I dyed my hair with a semi permanant hair color (soft black) by natural instincts. It had well been over 28 washes and my hair was stick jet black. I tried using clarifying shampoos to get the color out but nothing was working. I finally dicided to give Color Oops a try. I followed all the directions and waited the 20 min. it said. When I was finished washing and blow drying my hair I was amazed at the results. The black was completely gone leaving me with the medium brown color I had before. The color had a slight reddish tint so it was more like a chocolate cherry but it looked great. I didn&#x27;t even have to re-dye my hair with another color because I loved the color it left with me with so much. This stuff definately works. I&#x27;ll be using it again if I ever run into this situation again! Not sure how it works with permanant hair color though.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally dark, but is starting to get a few greys in it.  So I purchased Superior Preference by L&#x27;oreal in Dark Brown No. 4, which was a mistake!  It came out JET black.    Like other reviewers, I tried using Prell, and washing my hair to no avail.  I was going to try and live with it until it lightened up, but after two days, I just could not stand it anymore!    I went to the store to purchase L&#x27;oreal Haircolor Remover, but I was in such a hurry that I had picked up the Color Oops by mistake.  I decided to give it a try.  At first I kept peeking at my hair in the mirror, but I couldn&#x27;t see any change.  I washed my hair, rinsed it for 3-5 min, washed again, rinsed for 3-5 min, washed again and rinsed for another 3-5 min; then left conditioner on for 5 minutes.  When I got out of the shower after about 15 minutes, I didn&#x27;t think it had worked.  But after I dried my hair, I was very pleased! My hair color was perfect!  It brought my hair back to a nice rich brown color.   With the L&#x27;oreal Haircolor Remover, it would have stripped my hair of color and I would have had to redye it.  The Color Oops eliminated this step, thank goodness, and saved my hair some wear and tear. I would use certainly use this product again :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how the product works becaue and application nozzle was not included in te box and the company didn&#x27;t care that I didn&#x27;t get one. Wouldn&#x27;t be such a big deal if i didn&#x27;t live so far away from a store but I live 30 miles away and it&#x27;s not a trip of convenience to go return the product fora nozzle. Needless to say the company needs to work on customer service.</li>
    <li> I wanted my natural hair color back after about a year of dying my hair red. A few months ago I attempted to get my hair color back by dying brown over the faded red, but it ended being auburn instead of my natural gold brown. So I waited for that to fade and decided to take a chance with Color Oops. I didnt think it would take the extra strength to get the old red tones out since it was so old, but the results were not completely what I anticipated. It didnt get all the color out, but it did a good enough job that I pretty much have my hair color back with little to no red tones underneath. I was slightly let down because the other reviews made it sound like a miracle worker, but then again, I was trying to remove dye from several treatments and it is meant to remove only one layer of color. All in all I was satisfied but not \\&quot;wowed.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This product is great if you&#x27;re looking for much dryer hair of a very slightly different color. If you want color removed, however, you&#x27;re SOL with this stuff. I dyed my hair dark purple (Pravanna) a month ago and now that the roots are growing in the plan was to remove the purple to make room for dying it a normal color. I didn&#x27;t even have high expectations for the stuff but considering that my hair was bleach blonde right before the purple, I expected it to at least lift out SOME of the dark color. All it did was turn it an equally dark shade of muddy navy the texture of straw. I&#x27;m equally distraught and angry over the results this product gave me. Do not buy. Ever.</li>
    <li> Absolute fail.  It didn&#x27;t pull any of the color out.  Just be careful when you buy your color in the first place.</li>
    <li> So after reading the reviews on this product everyone said it worked amazingly great so I decided to get it in because my hair is extra thick and long I got two boxes and I&#x27;ve been dying my hair permanent black for about three years now so I figured I would use an extra strength instead of regular strength color oops... So I applied it and I follow the instructions exactly how it said and I&#x27;ve got to say that for having to rinse my hair for a total of 45 minutes in the shower it was so not worth it my hair is still black... It did lift some of the black out like on my tips I can see that they are brown but it didn&#x27;t do my whole head and I&#x27;m very disappointed because I thought that it would work miracles like everyone said it would. I will try another application in two weeks hopefully it works then but as of right now I&#x27;m very sad it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that this was rated under four stars, this is my second time using it and I am thrilled to have this product available. I cannot speak to Color Oops successfully reverting a first time hair-dyer&#x27;s hair back to its original color as I have been dyeing my hair for twenty years. However, the one result I feared more than anything was obvious damage; I am happy to report that this was not the case. A couple caveats; My hair is somewhat thick, my hair was in pretty good condition and has almost always been so and finally, it does do some damage as ANY processing will. That said, once it was product&#x27;d up and blown dry - you would not be able to tell much if any difference from before the color removal and re-dye. A colleague of mine ran her fingers through and could not believe what my hair had been through the day before.&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, with hair that is decent shape to begin with, follow the directions ( take them seriously, including the re-color advice ) and this product will work very well for you!</li>
    <li> it stinks soooo bad.......it made my dark brown hair orangy yellow and even after rinsing for 20 minutes it still stunk......now a few weeks later it is the color of an old hershey bar........and everytime i wash my hair it still stinks......bad stuff</li>
    <li> I used this product according to its manual, my hair  got its natural blond back at first and turned back brown within two hours.</li>
    <li> Yes it&#x27;s stinky and yes it&#x27;s messy, however, this stuff worked a miracle on my head.&lt;br /&gt;For several years I have kept my hair in the red-red family (I&#x27;m originally a mousey brown) and decided that I needed a change.  Horrible idea as it turns out.  The stylist accidentally turned my hair black black. (Aveda permanent color)  Like dull black.  It was supposed to be a warm chocolatey brown.  It had no shine and it looked horrible.  Washed it and washed it and washed it and a little shine returned to it but it was still definitely black.  So I head back to the salon... a different salon because you only get one chance to totally screw up my hair.  This time they used Martix semi-permanent over highlights to lighten the black mess.  The parts that were highlighted were fantastic.  The underside in the back was still a horrible nasty black but now sported a black cherry appearance.  Regardless, it looked like a train wreck.&lt;br /&gt;I tried fading it at home with laundry detergent, dish soap, vitamin C, etc. and all that took a little color out but not enough to make it blend with my new highlights.  We were approaching that chocolate brown we spoke of earlier. Unfortunately, deep chocolate brown was no longer the goal.  So, in a desperate last ditch effort before I resorted to peroxiding/bleaching the color out, I decided to give Color Oops a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;I put it in the affected section of my hair only.  (I don&#x27;t recommend this unless, like me, you only have one section of hair that is jacked up.) It stinks.  It can make a baby cry. Literally.  My baby smelled it on me and immediately crunched up his little face and started howling.  It also stinks up your bathroom if you leave the trash in the can (gotta fix that after this review so my husband doesn&#x27;t fuss at me....) It is runny and messy to apply.  Pick up your rugs, Take off your clothes or wear a smock.  Cover your sink with a towel.  It gets everywhere.  So I followed the directions and put the stuff on my head quickly (per the directions) and waited the prescribed 20 minutes. **WARNING: DO NOT MASSAGE THIS STUFF INTO YOUR SCALP LIKE SHAMPOO!!! It does kinda burn if it gets on your skin so I imagine it would do a real number on your scalp if you scrubbed it in there.  Just coat your hair and put on the cap.  After exactly 20 minutes, I pulled the cap off and could immediately see a difference.  I got in the shower and rinsed and rinsed and rinsed. Then I shampooed, rinsed, conditioned, and rinsed with a very high quality shampoo/conditioner.  All together, my rinse time was around 10 minutes (I would suggest doing it for longer.)  I put a little dot of leave in conditioner and couldn&#x27;t wait to blowdry my hair.  The result was stunning.  It had lifted the cherry color and the black and left my hair it&#x27;s original lighter red (almost strawberry blonde.)  I was so excited that I ran through my house half naked asking my husband to look at my head.  It did darken back up just a little bit (that&#x27;s why I suggest rinsing for longer) but it still is 1000 times better than it was to start with.  It does leave your hair a little dry but definitely not nearly as bad a a color processing. Using a hot oil treatment and allowing it to \\&quot;rest\\&quot; for 2-3 days afterwards will most likely do the trick. I will probably do it one more time after the color on the top starts to fade but I cannot emphasize how much better my hair looks.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions.  Rinse extremely well.  Get someone to help you if you can.  Dispose of the stinky trash stuff as soon as possible.</li>
    <li> I had my hair colored auburn for years &amp; I just moved so went to local beauty shop today &amp; told them I wanted auburn &amp; it turned out black. I came home &amp; cried it looks so horrendous! So my husband went to drug store &amp; found oops. I followed instructions &amp; rinsed for 15 min. Like magic it all washed out...no color in tub &amp; turned my hair a beautiful shade of Blonde that looks &amp; feels healthy.I love it!!</li>
    <li> I decided to wait a few days before writing this just to make sure everything stayed the way it was supposed to, and it did!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many of the other people that bought this product, I didn&#x27;t have a hair catastrophe that made me run out and buy this. I had been dying it a very dark brown shade for over a year and I just felt like I needed a change. I wanted to go to a light brown but with my hair being almost black, I knew it would be impossible to change that at home. So I started calling salons and concluded that I would most definitely not be paying the ridiculous amount they all wanted to strip my color and start all over. I thought it was hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon Color Oops online and started to do some research. All I really wanted to do was lift my color enough to dye over it again. There were mixed reviews about it and some of the horror stories made me afraid to make the plunge. But being the impatient person I am, I bought it and hoped for the best.&lt;br /&gt;The process, in itself, is not fun. When I put the two ingredients together, it bubbled up and started making fizzing noises. It is very runny as well, so you kind of have to be careful and work fast. A common comment I read was about the smell, and I was very concerned about that. I found that it was very strong, but definitely not unbearable. I waited the 20 minutes with the faint smell of rotten eggs lingering about my head and then started to rinse.&lt;br /&gt;This part is definitely the worst. I started off with just my head over the tub, but jumped in the shower after realizing that 20 minutes is way too long to be bent over like that. I shampooed, then rinsed. Shampooed, then rinsed. Then I did it again about two more times. In total, I think I spent about 40 minutes in the shower doing that. The box does say that the longer you rinse, the better the results. Your hair is going to feel dry after you get out, but just condition it and you&#x27;ll be fine. I&#x27;ve been processing my hair for a long timeand honestly, it didn&#x27;t feel much worse than if I just took hair dye to it.&lt;br /&gt;The results were ridiculous. My hair is now a light to medium brown. Definitely on the lighter side. I seriously could not believe my eyes when it dried. I like it so much that I&#x27;m not even going to dye it again.&lt;br /&gt;All I could really say is that this stuff is a miracle, as long as you follow the directions. The process may be a pain but I promise that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Okay, so my natural hair color is dirty blonde and i decided to dye it dark brown. I gave it a few months to see if i like it and i didnt. So my mom bought me 1 box of Color Oops. I did exactly what it said to do and NOTHING happened! So about a week ago i bought 2 more boxes thinking maybe i didnt have enough. My mom did  it and she did it right. And again IT DID NOTHING! This product is a waste of money and time. I WOULD NOT recommend this product to anyone! I gave it 1 star because thats the lowest it goes. TERRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using different brands of ash brown hair color for 21 years and thought I&#x27;d give chestnut brown a try. It was a bad idea. I was afraid Color Oops would ruin my hair or leave patches, but it worked perfectly. The odor is bad, but if you rinsed for 15-20 minutes as the instruction says, it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. I had to throw away the towel and scissors I used to open the package with because the smell won&#x27;t wash off. I would also invest in a good moisturizing conditioner to undo the damage caused by multiple chemical processes.</li>
    <li> BRILLIANT. I was really nervous to use this so I did a strand test first. Followed the instructions to the letter. I only have bobbed hair and used all of it, so if you have long hair you need to order two. I had put a very dark semi perm on my hair, which is naturally chestnut. I had left it about 2 weeks after coloring it really dark, and decided to take the plunge as I really didn&#x27;t like it so dark. Left it on hair for 20 mins, shampooed, rinsed for a further 10, shampooed and conditioned. The color is so nice that I have been left with I don&#x27;t need to add another color on top. Its a beautiful chestnut. I am not sure how it works with permanent dye, but it worked great for semi permanent. I would recommend this product to save you a fortune in the salon. It&#x27;s worth notice that it can sting a bit and I do have fine hair and sensitive skin, but nothing you can&#x27;t handle. DO A STRAND TEST FIRST. That&#x27;s the way I knew I would like it.</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago after using a new shade of red that did NOT work out.  It did not bring me back to my natural haircolor because that had been altered by the developer in the dyes I&#x27;ve used on my hair.  What it did do was remove the color that had been deposited with those developers and gave me a pale yellow to work with instead of dark brown/red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years later I&#x27;m using it to remove my regular strawberry blonde in portions of my hair to dye pink.  It&#x27;s much, much less harsh on my hair than bleach.  I use this to remove the red dye and if I have to, I use a little bleach to finish it off.  I&#x27;m so glad this product exists so that I can fry my hair only the amount absolutely required :)</li>
    <li> about 4 months ago i dyed a section of my hair blue. i had bleached it first and then dyed it. i bought this product because i wanted to remove the blue so that i could dye it another color. the blue had almost all faded so i expected this product to work. i followed all the instructions, including rising it out for 20 minutes, but i was very disappointed with the results. my hair looked almost exactly as it did before i used color oops. it did not take out the blue. the only thing it did was make the bleached part where the blue had already faded out look blonder. i regret buying this product. it was a waste of money</li>
    <li> Hi!&lt;br /&gt;Alright so my natural hair color is this very pretty milky brown. Being too stupid to leave it the way it was, I began dying my hair. I&#x27;ve pretty much dyed my hair constantly for years, and I&#x27;ve used the same red-brown for about six months. However, a few days ago I decided I wanted my old, natural color back. That&#x27;s when I found color oops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, you MUST MUST MUST do a strand test. I did a strand test and the color oops turned it a very light orange-brown. I figured that it was just left over from the ombre I did a few months ago, and set the clock for 15 minutes, which is how long it took the strand test to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as people say it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alright, so after fifteen minutes, I took off my shower cap and discovered my entire head was half red-brown left over from my last dye job and half bright orange/blond. It really just looked completely awful. I made a fun, 45 minute long playlist on my computer to listen to while I went through the extensive rinsing process. Remember, the more you wash and rinse the better it works. After the rinsing process, my hair was just as horrific looking. However, I can completely say that this was entirely my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I had been dying my hair red-brown for YEARS&lt;br /&gt;2. I didn&#x27;t buy nearly enough color oops. I have long, very thick hair and should have purchased two boxes. I only purchased one.&lt;br /&gt;3. I left it on a tad too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I bought a hair dye very close to my natural color, used it over the color oops mess, and honestly the dye took VERY VERY well. My hair looks MUCH BETTER than it did when I just dyed it over my other dye jobs, and it isn&#x27;t that damaged either. So if you&#x27;re looking to just lighten your hair, PLEASE do not use this unless you plan on dying it again after</li>
    <li> Please read the full review, as I feel it&#x27;s very important to let people know what this stuff did to my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am a natural redhead. I wasn&#x27;t worried about the \\&quot;orange\\&quot; color that everyone mentioned that the color oops had left their hair because that&#x27;s my natural color! I wanted to make my hair a bit more brilliant BUT I wanted to STAY RED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dye I used SUCKED - it made my hair straight-up BROWN. Mousy brown. I wanted it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this stuff and went for it. I followed the instructions exactly. As everyone else mentioned, it reeks. Like a big fart on your head... gross, but totally tolerable - especially if it&#x27;s going to get that gross color out, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - I rinsed... and rinsed and rinsed for what felt like days. I didn&#x27;t see anything coming out in the shower, but once I got out and towel dried my hair I could see a dramatic difference. My hair was back to its original color! Well, pretty close, it was a few shades lighter, but I had read that might happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited. My scalp was stinky, but the brown was gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***THAT is where the positive part of the review ends.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I notice that my hair is falling out rapidly.. while I am just sitting around. I was careful not to even COMB it afterward or even dry it roughly with the towel. I just blotted it and let it air dry. I did deep conditioning treatments. I left it air dry without brushing/combing for the next 2 weeks! But, my hair just keeps falling out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am literally concerned that it may all be gone soon - and I am not exaggerating. If I run my hand through my hair, it will come out with about 20 strands stuck between my fingers. When I wash it, the gigantic drain in my shower becomes clogged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled all of it off of the drain after the last shower and felt nauseous at the amount that had come out during that particular shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ALSO noticed that each and every time I wash my hair more and more color is disappearing! Far beyond my natural color. I mean.. it is now weird and dull and almost the color of sand. The (natural) redness of my hair is pretty much gone, yet it isn&#x27;t blonde either. It&#x27;s weird. And each and every time I wash it it becomes more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO - I am desperately trying to figure out how I can possibly fix this. I know it damages your hair and you can use a \\&quot;protein filler\\&quot; to RE-DYE your hair, which I am PETRIFIED of doing at this point... I am also in a panic about losing all of my hair! I cannot even express how stressed this has me. I have mentioned nothing of this to anyone and people have noticed the thinning and it&#x27;s only been TWO WEEKS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know how I can make my hair stop falling out? How can I make the color - what was already even lighter than my natural color - stop diminishing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - if you&#x27;re thinking of using this - DO NOT DO IT. I can&#x27;t believe nobody mentioned the hair loss thing or the fact that it continues to remove your hair&#x27;s pigment, natural and otherwise for weeks afterward :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AVOID!!!!!!air more and more color is disappearing!

    <li> I&#x27;m very Happy with this product, it took out a lot of my black hair out, I was happy with the out look.. Thanks</li>
    <li> I thought i&#x27;d share my personal experience in case it helps anyone out there.&lt;br /&gt;I am one of the many victims of Clairol&#x27;s \\&quot;Darkest Natural Brown\\&quot; It was only after announcing my hair disaster on Facebook that i found out this hair color commonly turns some people&#x27;s hair black. And i don&#x27;t mean \\&quot;really dark brown\\&quot; i mean blacker than a raven&#x27;s wing, even in sunlight. My hair was not dyed previously, and my hair generally doesn&#x27;t hold dyes well. I used to have to go several shades darker to get what i wanted. So naturally i was surprised when my hair came out black. It doesn&#x27;t look good on me.&lt;br /&gt;I used Color Oops about 6 hours after dying my hair. Everyone warned me it would stink to high heaven and make my hair feel like straw. Neither of these things happened. I wouldn&#x27;t want to smell like that all the time, but the product wasn&#x27;t that bad. I&#x27;ve smelt worse cleaning the litter box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, fine, dry hair, cut very short, and was worried about over-frying it, so i only used half the bottle and let the stuff process 15 minutes. I did rinse for 20 minutes, as indicated. The color didn&#x27;t wash out entirely. It ended up a very dark auburn that, in bright light, you could see red. Better, but not the strip that was promised. I figured it was because i didn&#x27;t let it process long enough. The next day, i tried again. I used the whole bottle on my 3 inches of hair let it process the whole 20 minutes, rinsed as directed, followed the instructions to the letter. Again, it&#x27;s lighter- it&#x27;s definately red now- but my natural hair color is a medium to light brown. I&#x27;m nowhere near my original color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product 3 stars because: 1) i know people who have used it and have had a great deal of success with it. A lot depends on your hair type and what kind of dye you used. 2) i&#x27;m using this on a particularly stubborn dye that one friend said a professional couldn&#x27;t get out of her hair without bleach. And 3) the instructions don&#x27;t say what happens if you do this twice. And for the shampooing, i used a moisturizing shampoo. You&#x27;re not supposed to condition till you&#x27;re done, so I have to grant some leeway in case i messed it up somehow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t assume the product is a guarantee that your hair will be back to as if nothing ever happened. It won&#x27;t darken your hair if you dyed it too light, and it doesn&#x27;t work on crazy colors like you&#x27;d get from Manic Panic and those sorts of dyes. This stuff is made to work on hair dyes that attempt to replicate a color found in nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product is not an \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; type of scam. I liked that they explain the science behind all of it right there in the instructions. It can work, and if you&#x27;re really in a bind and don&#x27;t have the cash for a professional correction, it&#x27;s worth a shot. The color my hair ended up is close to L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Cinnamon. Not what i was going for, but way better than going Goth at my age!if you do this twice.

    <li> I order this product because it said it was non bleaching and peroxide free, it didn&#x27;t remover the color, it bleached my hair. I have naturally dark hair and have been using a dark shade, the oops left my hair a light brownish orange color, obviously only a color bleaching would create. I got a little on my short and it bleached my shirt so that always confirms that it does in fact bleach. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this this product and I won&#x27;t be using it in the future.</li>
    <li> I was sort of confused by the directions....and i think this was the product that i had to use a lot of water to get it to do, what it&lt;br /&gt;was suppose to do...</li>
    <li> An over 65 experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that many of these reviews are written by younger women who experiment with different colors in their hair. I thought I&#x27;d add my perspective as a senior. I get my hair colored (especially the root touchups) every 2- 3 weeks. I have stayed with a med brown as that has always been my original color. Recently I noticed that even though the roots were colored the rest of my hair was getting darker and darker which is really unflattering on a woman of age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser told me about correcting that by using a color remover. She said it would take out the old color and then we could start again with a softer brown. Rather than pay the hundred dollar for the process I did my research and bought Color Oops. I bought regular as I had no idea what it would do. You must pay attention to what the directions say. I have no idea what chemicals are in this but they smell terrible. I wish I would have read the post of the reviewer who said to lay down old towels everywhere. I would recommend lots of paper towels or a throw away towel placed in your sink. I had to do this in my bathroom because I needed good light and a mirror. Some of the product dripped in my sink and I rinsed it down the drain  ( don&#x27;t do that!).  48 hours later the smell is still there even after a thorough cleaning and mopping.  Had I had a towel in the sink it would now be in the garbage out of my house along with the box and used bottles. That&#x27;s  the downside of it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the product ( they don’t want it on your head more than 20  minutes ) I inadvertently had a terrible emergency call which kept me on the phone 25 minutes. I was in a panic when I looked at the clock and realized the time. My hair is on the thin side and I seriously wondered if I would have any left. I rushed into the shower and proceeded to rinse for 15 minutes and shampooed twice. When I came out and looked in the mirror I was shocked at how much color was gone.I was now a blonde which actually I rather liked. I am giving this product 5 stars because for me it did exactly what it promised. Also there was no damage done to my hair. Make sure though, be very sure that you are committed to rinsing your hair for at least 15 minutes. And more than likely it stands to reason to say that the longer, younger and thicker your hair the more you need to heed that instruction. I had no odor on my hair afterward and my hair felt silky smooth with no irritation which I always have with color (even with Sweet &amp; Low as an equalizer).Of course it now needs to have an even color applied but I expected that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that this product would be worth your while to use at least once a year if you color or touch up your hair often. It will get rid of a color build up and I believe will give your hair much more depth when a fresh color is applied.. And it goes without saying that if you have made an “Oops” on your hair color this is the product to try.</li>
    <li> I bought this to get rid of the black dye in my hair.  I&#x27;d read numerous reviews saying that this stuff was the way to go for that.  It did NOT worth in the slightest for me, even though I (along with the help of my husband) followed the instructions exactly.</li>
    <li> I used this product after the light brown hair dye that I got turned my hair black. I used this exactly as directed and I was horrified when my hair turned orange. I had to run back to the store to get another light brown color, which covered up the orange but now my hair is just as dark as to begin with!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair color at all - just made my hair smell terrible.... ... ... ... ..</li>
    <li> My hair is a dirty blonde naturally but I&#x27;ve been dying it a dark auburn red for about 2.5 years now, got bored and decided I had to lighten it ...wanted to try this because I&#x27;m pretty cautious about damaging my strands and didn&#x27;t want to dive straight into bleaching them. Read hundreds of reviews which led me to choose Color Oops so hopefully this will help someone else. I followed the directions in the box and even rinsed a little bit longer but the first time around being in the shower that long just got way too hot combined with the sulfur smell and was a bit overwhelming; I&#x27;d recommend rinsing your hair out in a sink if you can. I did that when I used a second box because the first time the color \\&quot;release\\&quot; was a bit too uneven, very light orange yellow on top and still rather dark red brown on the bottom/underneath. The second time I shampooed about 6 times and rubbed and massaged my hair a lot more (also had on some awesome water stopping gloves that had some texture on the outside of the fingers) and this seemed a little more effective. Both times I followed up with a conditioning restorative treatment and my hair feels great (I waited 1 day between applications but the box says you can do up to 3 treatments in a row). The product itself was pretty easy to use and apply, just be prepared for the stink. Wide-tooth combing it definitely helped with the even distribution.  Try to apply it as quickly and evenly as safely possible and go for the darker parts first, and rinse very thoroughly giving your old dyes plenty of time to wash out. Instead of a dark brownish red my hair is now a light yellow/orange without any real noticeable damage, and I&#x27;m pretty pleased with it (so far). It was a great non-traumatizing step in my quest to go much lighter.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do that much but it did make it lighter. My hair was a darkish brown and now its a brown.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions on the box. And it worked!  My natural hair color is black. I&#x27;m Indian - to give you a sense of my coloring.  I usually have brown based highlights put in - honey, caramel, etc... but this time I wanted dark red.  The dark red did look fabulous and I kept it from October through January - it required cold showers, and refreshing with a gloss every 3 weeks to keep that great intense dark red.  Otherwise it was coppery with a slight orange feel to it and I didn&#x27;t like it.  I went to an expensive salon to get a neat mid length cut that had lots of movement, and also to change the color of my hair and 3 hours later my hair was slightly less reddish.&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile -this product cost 10 bucks and 30 minutes of my life, and I ended up with the red entirely stripped. Now I have honey highlights - a blondeish color that they get after my brown highlights fade, so I&#x27;m used to this color. I could darken those strands to a golden brown if I wanted, but I&#x27;m going to leave it as is for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was VERY pleased. I got what I wanted.  The smell was atrocious.  Like Yellowstone. A caldera. Nasty.  I put a ton of potion # 9 (Sebastien) on my hair to add it&#x27;s own perfumed smell and put a shower cap on for 30 minutes. Then I went to bed. When I woke up the strong caldera smell was gone, so it only lasted about 10 hours</li>
    <li> In my experience Color Oops didn&#x27;t just remove the hair dye from my hair, it removed all color and acted as a bleach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural hair color is blonde, I had dyed it red, after Color Oops it was that bright yellow you get from bleaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing the patch test!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, it does have an awful smell that lingers.</li>
