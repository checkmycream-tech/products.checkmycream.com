      <li>Love this product...</li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>I love that the colors are nude tones and without spakles in it.  </li>
      <li>but I some how broke the top from the bottom.  </li>
      <li>right here had a lot of good reviews.</li>
      <li>They work pretty good for not being</li>
      <li>Easy to blend out and mix</li>

      <li>The price is hardly anything, and they are very good.</li>
      <li>They go on easily, are nice and opaque, and don&#x27;t tend to gather into the crease of my eyelid like some other shadows do.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it before and this is definitely my favorite mainly because it&#x27;s so much cheaper.</li>
      <li>I have issues with eye shadows irritating my eyelids and have thrown out so many new products after using 1 or 2 times -- happy to report no problems and that I have a new favorite shadow.  </li>
      <li>That was a long time and many purchases ago, and I am now loyal to the W7 brand.</li>
      <li>The colors look nice in the pan, but they&#x27;re not very pigmented.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>Maybe not urban decay naked palate good, but no one was expecting that anyways.</li>
      <li>Love it just like a naked pallet &amp; fast shipping</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with everything I have tried from them, and this little palette is no exception.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>

      <li>high end shadows</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>and I live</li>
      <li>I first heard about this brand when I searched for a cheaper alternative to the Naked palettes.</li>
      <li>its not super strongly pigmented but if you&#x27;re using it for a natural look as I am then that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
      <li>Please do not waste your money on this.</li>
      <li>actually I think almost two weeks early.</li>
      <li>Its not long wearing either.</li>

<li> Its a major disappointment.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve had this palette for a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s holding up well with no breakage or any of the colors getting hard or chalky.</li>
<li> And I can&#x27;t even comment on the colors because the pigmentation is awful and its hard to tell.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fast shipping! Ordered on the 10th, got it the 24th. Unopened (taped up), unharmed, decently pigmented. All for $7. Overall 5 stars! I would for sure order again!</li>
    <li> The colors look nice in the pan, but they&#x27;re not very pigmented. When I blend multiple colors on my lid I feel like they just disappear.</li>
    <li> The colors are nice but they don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I ordered &amp;#34;In the mood&amp;#34; &amp; &amp;#34;In the city&amp;#34;. Wow am I impressed. The price is hardly anything, and they are very good. Maybe not urban decay naked palate good, but no one was expecting that anyways. They are also very cute. Free shipping PLUS they came over a week actually I think almost two weeks early. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shadows at all ... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend ... The picture is different then in Person</li>
    <li> Please do not waste your money on this. I regret my decision. I bought this only because I was looking for a cheaper nude palette and this one right here had a lot of good reviews. I bought the in the city one. Its packaging is fine, can&#x27;t complain for the price. Its the shadows I don&#x27;t like. They are extremely powdery. I played around with them trying to work with them, I used them wet as well but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me. And I can&#x27;t even comment on the colors because the pigmentation is awful and its hard to tell. Its not long wearing either. Its a major disappointment.</li>
    <li> Mess-free and very nice colors! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Pritty good came on time what you see in the picture is what you get nice!</li>
    <li> Gorgeous matte colors. Easy to blend out and mix</li>
    <li> Absolutely love these colors. Beautiful, they are all completely matte and apply smoothly and evenly better than what I expected</li>
    <li> Love it just like a naked pallet &amp; fast shipping</li>
    <li> This product blends in perfectly with my skin tone and because its matte, no one can tell you&#x27;re wearing makeup if you use it to contour. I have hooded eyes so I have been using this eyeshadow to add depth to my eyes and it wprls great. its not super strongly pigmented but if you&#x27;re using it for a natural look as I am then that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
    <li> I just received to today! I ordered on June 13th and the estimated delivery was July 10th - July 27th. So it came in 9 days- and one of those days was sunday. So technically came in 8 days. So delivery: AMAZING. Although I never received any tracking code because it was shipped through Royal Mail from the UK and I live Kansas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely compare this to Urban Decay Naked Basic palette. I&#x27;ve used it before and this is definitely my favorite mainly because it&#x27;s so much cheaper. But I just love these Matte eyeshadows! My palette came in one piece and looks so new and is definitely going to be used for everyday, traveling, and anything. I LOVE IT. I plan on purchasing W7&#x27;s other palettes &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Great eye shadow,  wished it came with brush though.</li>
    <li> They work pretty good for not being high end shadows its a good product for those that are trying to save money on makeup. Nice matte colors!</li>
    <li> Excellent, arrived on time. Packaged properly. Everything was ok.</li>
    <li> This review is for the &amp;#34;In the City&amp;#34; version. I first heard about this brand when I searched for a cheaper alternative to the Naked palettes. That was a long time and many purchases ago, and I am now loyal to the W7 brand. I am very pleased with everything I have tried from them, and this little palette is no exception. I use the W7 eyeshadow primer and my eyeshadow brushes and get great results from these colors every time. They go on easily, are nice and opaque, and don&#x27;t tend to gather into the crease of my eyelid like some other shadows do. I&#x27;ve had this palette for a couple of months now, and it&#x27;s holding up well with no breakage or any of the colors getting hard or chalky. I like that I can get both day and night looks from this one palette, and it&#x27;s small enough to carry in my little makeup bag. Some of the shades can even double as eyebrow filler for me, which has come in handy more than once. I will be buying this one again!</li>
    <li> I love that the colors are nude tones and without spakles in it.  Sometimes a girl don&#x27;t feel like all that shine!</li>
    <li> Love this product... nice color and it stays on all day.  I have issues with eye shadows irritating my eyelids and have thrown out so many new products after using 1 or 2 times -- happy to report no problems and that I have a new favorite shadow.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Nice shades, blends well. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I love it!! I got it early which is amazing and all the colors were intact. The colors are pigmented and are beautiful. the cases is good but I some how broke the top from the bottom.  The brush isn&#x27;t the best but I bought it only for the shadows. I would recommend it.</li>
