<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Good. Glides on easily. Nice coverage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a lipstick, because I could not find a white lipstick.  I put my regular lipstick on first, then dab this on my lower lip.  It seems to make my eyes pop.  Don&#x27;t know if this makes sense.</li>
    <li> one of the best white pencils i ever used!!</li>
    <li> It cannot be pushed up, so after a few uses it&#x27;s blunt and the tip is basically gone. You have to go in with a brush to get it all out, which I think defeats the purpose of having it easily accessible in the pencil. It is very bright and creamy.. Great for brightening tired eyes.</li>
    <li> This liner is amazing and helps open up your eyes</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just fab and I do a lot with it!  It&#x27;s just like it was described! The pigment is what I love the most</li>
    <li> I have purchases many of these since the first one. Just make sure you get a sharpener for them as the ones from other brands don&#x27;t fit perfectly. I have also melted these into small jars to use as an eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> It was wrapped up safely which was great! I had to fight to get it out but that&#x27;s fine with me lol as long as its not broken I&#x27;m happy. The product work great. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Cheap, doesn&#x27;t hold on, gets into fine lines,  smears easily. Would not recommend to buy.  You can find better even for the same price.</li>
    <li> I bought this for and used it at a base as recommended in a Monarch Butterfly makeup tutorial on YouTube.  It worked fantastic and I would recommend it for use as a base for any intense powdered color special effect look you wanted to create.</li>
    <li> Worth the price, it&#x27;s very pigmented! Love it for highlighting my lower-inner eyes.It really shows up on my tan brown skin.</li>
    <li> good, HOWEVER, it has the tendency to make pinks look like purple...i would recommend it only for highlights only...great seller</li>
    <li> Worked perfect for my Halloween costume! Used it to outline the spots I was going to face paint white, and also for my eyebrows!</li>
    <li> I have fallen in love with the product. They go on very nice and are creamy with no tug when applied. Would recommend this to a friend and will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I am not affiliated with this prodcut and ti was purchased with my own hard earned money. I use this as a eyeshadow base so that my colors pop. I am african american and I have a caramel complexion. This pencil allows my shadows true pigments to show with little effort on my part. I no longer need to cake my shadow on my lids. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> very good, to illuminate a makeup look, and perfect I particularly recommend.very good, to illuminate a makeup look, and I particularly recomendo.Tambem perfect and too good to pass under the eyes, giving a bright look.</li>
    <li> stays on all day, creamy, and perfect for eyeshadow bases</li>
    <li> love this i use it in my waterline it doesn&#x27;t stay white all day but it is lighter than my natural rim color.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used that much until now, but it does what is proposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;In my clear skin fits perfectly. (wife&#x27;s review)</li>
    <li> I use this product mostly for lining my waterline and I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t run, and it stays on for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> Love this pencil. Great for liner, or even a base for silvers/whites. Also use as a highlighter. Awesome. Super creamy, great product, must have in your make-up bag!</li>
    <li> Great product. Overall, I&#x27;ve had only great experiences with using NYX products, if only I could find them locally - so Amazon is a great place for me :)  I use this under other colors for more \\&quot;pop\\&quot; and its pretty long lasting...my next one will be the black bean and the gold :) Only drawback is the price + shipping...if you only order 1 the shipping is almost the same price :/ so that I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> This pencil works really well glides on smoothly and stays on through the day no problems with this pencil nor with the brand.</li>
    <li> i used the black one... i loved the idea of a jumbo eye shadow pencil cause its easy to use and gives me the look i want. but its just too messy and greasy. with an improved formula this could be a great product. the greasy-ness also causes creases on the lid</li>
    <li> This pencil is a must-have for any make up user it is the perfect base for any eyeshadow and it is bright white and blends flawlessly😍😍👍👍👍</li>
    <li> This is a great white eyeliner.  It goes on smooth and blends so easily.</li>
    <li> I am so happy i purchased it, shipping was super fast, but the product was amazing. Its very creamy, easy to blend, eye shadows look much better with this. Kudos.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy just what I wanted. The nix jumbo pencil is perfect glides on smoothly and stays long makeshift eyeshadows pop just what I wanted</li>
    <li> this is just perfect to dab on the corner of your eyes to get an easy glam look! i love this. and the price was great</li>
    <li> I love makeup and NYX but I have never ever used an eye highlighter pencil of any sort until this one, now I will never look back. I know it says this pencil is an eyeshadow but I&#x27;d never use it as an eyeshadow just because I don&#x27;t like the idea of cream shadows. I&#x27;ve seen tons of gurus on Youtube use this pencil in the way I did today, which convinced me to buy it, and I&#x27;ll swear by it now. I used it for the first time today in two ways. I put it on over my eyeshadow primer and it made the colors I put on more bright than they would be without it. I then used it on my inner lids by my tear duct and lined my water line with it. I would like to get a smaller pencil in this color for that but the effect was PHENOMENAL! I couldn&#x27;t believe how much it made my eyes pop. Just adding that hint of white from the Milk pencil made my eyes look so much bigger and brighter I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I would use this even on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup just to have that really awake look. I will be buying more of this color.</li>
    <li> Love this pencil. I would definitely recommend it. It really helped my dark eye shadows more prominent and vibrant.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d watched a few YouTube videos on certain makeup techniques, and found more than a few ladies endorsing this pencil for anything from an eyeliner to brow highlighter or shadow. So, when I finally located one, I just had to buy it to see what they were talking about. Wow, what a white this is! The color is called \\&quot;milk\\&quot; but it might as well be called \\&quot;brightest white you&#x27;ll ever use.\\&quot; I use it as a liner and it puts the whites of my eyes to shame. This pencil really packs the (lack of?) pigment. It&#x27;s more of a waxy crayon than creamy pencil, but that is fine because it&#x27;s virtually painless on my waterline and glides wonderfully. I&#x27;ve used it as a base for my lids, under other colors, but I find that the waxes that make up the first few major ingredients tend to melt and crease on your lids during hot days/parties, so I would suggest a primer for real staying power. (The NYX Eyeshadow Base Primer pot works well in my experience.) I&#x27;m a tan to medium brown African-American, so this isn&#x27;t my first choice for a lid color, but for eye-opening effects and brightening, there really is no need to buy anything else!</li>
    <li> Better price then ulta!&lt;br /&gt;And I prefer this pencil over MAC or other brands. It&#x27;s great as a base all over the eyelid, will make all your eyeshadow colors really POP and looks great in the waterline as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I think every girl should try this and this color! It&#x27;s a great primer, liner, eyeshadow, eyeshadow base, and highlight! :) I love it. But I love the seller as well! Love this! And it does not hurt to try this! &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow pencil is so smooth and creamy it works great as an eyeshadow base because the white makes the eyeshadow pop.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is great for making you look more awake even when you&#x27;re half-dead lol!</li>
    <li> This came extremely quick originally they said that it was suposed to arrive in early january but it arrived before Christmas! :D&lt;br /&gt;exelent customer service :&gt; and fast shpping will do buisness again :&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought one of these in Milk and I&#x27;m eager to get more. These are AMAZING. All it takes is one swipe and not only does the color glide on with ease, but it is PIGMENTED! Can be used as a shadow or an eyeshadow base (you can blend them as easily as you would a cream shadow). When used as an base, my eyeshadow DOES NOT BUDGE for the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con that I can see is that the caps crack very easily. Other than that, these are just fantastic and I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
    <li> A wonderful cruelty free opaque liner! True to the color name-&#x27;milk&#x27; and a great base for eyeshadow if you&#x27;re without primer potion. Glides on nice, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the eyes. Adds shimmer to sparkly shadow and a solid finish to matta (makes slightly lighter sometimes) blends AMAZING. A tip guys-I apply this liner below my brows and above and blend when I&#x27;m done with them to create a highlighted finished look. Everything I&#x27;ve heard about this pencil is comin true! A staple in any makeup artists vanity</li>
    <li> I love NYX products, these jumbo eye pencils are beautiful BUT they crease, even with a primer. I use Milk and Yogurt as bases for powder eye shadows. It makes the colors more true and helps it last longer. My other issue is trying to sharpen these pencils, close to impossible and you lose so much product. My solution is depotting them into a container, check You Tube for \\&quot;How To Depot NYX Jumbo Pencils\\&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t ruin or change the product in any way, you just save every bit of the eye pencil. Pacific is another gorgeous shade for using under purple or blue shadows.</li>
    <li> I loved this NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil! it worked perfectly and lasted me a really long time!&lt;br /&gt;Its a very vibrant white and looks beautiful</li>
    <li> I love the item from this person i got my item very fast and just the way it was described! Great product i will order more great for base on eyes</li>
    <li> I bought this product and have used it numerous times not only as a base, but as a primer. My eyeshadow never creases or budges. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Got the pencil in Milk, been using it when I&#x27;m trying to do a dramatic eye. -1 Star just because it does sharpen that easily, but other than that it is great! I used to a de-creaser primer but found this much more effective. Plus the fact that the color is so bright white it makes any color pop!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I really like this as a base coat underneath my eyeshadow and it keeps the color all day.</li>
    <li> I love the jumbo nyx pencil In milk. I use it as a base so eyeshadows look vibrant. I waited to buy this because I has hesitant but I should of purchased it sooner. Love it.</li>
    <li> It applies easily  and makes your eyeshadow stand out. I would reccommend this to all my friends. A great deal.</li>
    <li> I loved the product soo much (nyx jumbo eyepencil milk) Thanks so much for your amazing store! Ordered on Jan 8 Got on Jan 17! Amazing, thanks so much! Keep up the great work</li>
    <li> Like the other two penciles the color is nice,easy to pack and to use. For travleing all i needed was a sarpner and a blendind bruch and I did not have to worrie about a applcaion thing mujig and they did not take up a hole bunch of room. I would most defantly buy more.</li>
    <li> I love this product! You can use it as an eyeliner, primer, or eyeshadow. I ordered white because I planned on using it as a primer for light and dark colors and it exceeded my expectations! It&#x27;s thick, yet creamy and pigmented when used as an eyeliner. It lasts a long time for me, I will be ordering more in other colors!</li>
    <li> Goes on thick and gooey. Not very good for near the eyes</li>
    <li> Exactly what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> Very pigmented. Great for waterline, stays for long time</li>
    <li> I like the color but it tends to smear off</li>
    <li> Just got it today. Thick white line. I&#x27;m using it to line my waterline.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t have anything else to say but i love this so much. so fun! so quality! perfect white eye pencil. jumbo!</li>
    <li> when i did find thiz product i got it and boy was i amazmed for a makeup product thatz not Mac but has very high defiention and ilove how it goes on..thiz is a mst have...n i luv that n was package nicely n new</li>
    <li> Arrived in good time and in good condition. Purchased Milk color and it works fantastic. I have been using it every day since I received it.</li>
    <li> It is the perfect item to use as a base before you apply your colors to the lid.  It is creamy and the colors go on pigmented.  What more can you ask for? I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who needs a base for their eyecolors or who wants a nice white pencil.</li>
    <li> Its a great pencil !!! You can also use it as a shadow base as well.</li>
    <li> I have mixed feelings about this pencil...I saw a few of my fave beauty bloggers using it on you tube and praising it so I decided to buy two of those in case I fall in love with it madly as I was expecting..Well... here is MY own personal experience with this pencil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. ON waterline: You will need to apply it to your waterline with a brush because it smudges against your lower lashes...Also make sure you blend it out otherwise your waterline will look unreal scary white&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. AS a brow bone highlighter: the texture is very matter, but the brightness of the white does not allow for it to look highlighted. You must REALLY blend it out and even blended out it looks like you blended out white face paint on your eyes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. As a base: this is the ONLY area where I use this pencil the most. It provides a GREAT base for light color shadows.For dark ones it can get tricky since they whiteness again creeps out from underneath if it not very well blended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me a little of this product goes a VERY long way so don&#x27;t overdo it. The texture is very creamy so blending out is not an issue. For reference I have medium beige skin tone which gets olive in summer and light beige in winter.</li>
    <li> Loved it its really white and perfect to make your eyeshadows stay and look vibrant I really liked it alot its worth buying and so cheap u don&#x27;t have to spend alot for something of good quality</li>
    <li> Ordered for someone else</li>
    <li> Very white, however it cakes up when it touches hair. So around my eyelash line and if I use it for costume. Not incredibly impressed with the quality.</li>
    <li> I heard great reviews about these eyeliners, but they&#x27;re just okay. I bought it in Milk, and I have to say it&#x27;s exactly the same as my Rimmel white eyeliner (except this one is jumbo). I wanted to use this as a highlighter and for my waterline, but it just looks kinda chalky.</li>
    <li> Love it! Came in fast and it&#x27;s also used as a great primer!</li>
    <li> I use this NYX Jumbo Pencil (in Milk) more of an eyeshadow base than as an eye pencil because of the creamy texture and wide pencil point.  It does help colors to appear more vibrant &amp; also has similar effects of a primer/base (helps to prevent creasing/fading and helps the shadows or glitter stick to the lid).  Very good quality for this price point!  Will have to try the other colors!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s and ok base pencil for eyeshadow. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact I thought it was like a pencil...Instead its a plastic cover in which I thought would be difficult to sharpen. But ladies it sharpens with no problem. Just get a sharpener with a big opening.</li>
    <li> I got the pencil two days earlier than expected!  Plus, I tried it out and it looks great!  I got the Milk colored pencil and I have to say, it is fantastic, especially for African American women to go on top of a primer or to be used as the primary primer!  Makes colors go on vibrantly and pop out!  I will be ordering more of these.  Saw them on a video and was amazed at how smoothly they went on and how rich they were and I have to say....it is and it does just that...glides on.  Now I have to make an excuse to go somewhere so I can get dolled up!</li>
    <li> I love this product because it acts like a primer- it has a creamy consistency and keeps your colors bright for a long time. It didn&#x27;t crease for me, and i would definitely suggest this to anyone that likes experimenting with makeup. The packaging was also really nice aswell.</li>
    <li> I am in love with NYX eye pencil in milk. It makes all colors stand out.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so smooth going on, and it doesn&#x27;t crease, the shadow lasted so much longer with nyx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I love watching make up tutorials on youtube and a lot of artists use this as a base under shadow to make the color pop ur to line they eyebrows.  lasts a long time</li>
    <li> Love it. It was exactly what I was looking for goes on smooth.</li>
    <li> The white eyeliner tends to be a bit too cakey for me. It also needs to be reapplied frequently.</li>
    <li> These are great in theory but you definitely need to use a primer with them or else your eye shadow will crease like no other. Within an hour or two! To me they do not compare to MAC Paint pots which I don&#x27;t need a primer underneath. Sure they&#x27;re a good deal for the price, but if you have to pair it with a primer then what&#x27;s the point? I won&#x27;t be purchasing any more of these.</li>
    <li> I have been searching high and low for something that will make all my shadows stand out and i finally found it! love this thing.</li>
    <li> Excellent primer for eyeshadow!!! Makes your eyeshadow pop in my naturally dark eyelids.</li>
    <li> Great product, I love to use it as an eye primer for my shadow, no creasing and give a great base to really show the eyeshadow colors.</li>
    <li> I have med dark skin and sometimes I have to pack on my eye shadow.With this I don&#x27;t have to.It pop&#x27;s after 2 swipes with it.</li>
    <li> I have never gotten eye infections or styles. Each time I have used this product I have ended up with a large swollen lump under my eye lid. No thank you.</li>
    <li> NYX&#x27;s jumbo eye pencils are creamy and long-lasting. my product came in super fast and well packed</li>
    <li> I heard and seen alot about the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk color and wanted to try for myself.  At first it worked really well then the pencil itself&lt;br /&gt;seemed like it would melt quickly and get soft even after sharpening it.  I put it in the refridgerator and works really well on the waterline.  I would buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This product is great! Easy application and really brightens up my eyes when I use it on my waterline for cosplay!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I recently became very obsessed with make up tutorials on youtube and two of my favorite people use this as a primer. It always made their eyeshadow pop! I finally got it today and I love it! One of the girls on youtube put this in the inner corner of her eye as a liner to apply like a yellow eyeshadow onto(so pretty). Prior to getting this in the mail,  I tried to apply the eyeshadow in the inner corner of my eye without this and it did not work. I tried it again today and it did.  My eyeshadow is still on and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the pencil came wrapped very securely which I appretiated.</li>
    <li> I received this item in a couple days which was nice. Also the product is so nice. I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon</li>
    <li> This was a great deal and I was very pleased with the quality of my eyeshadow pencil. It came to me in perfect condition and very quickly. Happily grateful!:-)</li>
    <li> Excellent ! i use this as a base on top of my primer and it makes the eyeshadow very vibrant !</li>
    <li> very very smooth. Its great!!!</li>
    <li> I use this to help color my eyebrows. I evenly coat every hair, make sure its brushed in good, then I apply whatever eye shadow color I want.</li>
    <li> I use it as a primer and gives a really nice base. Makes my eye shadow look seamlessly perfect.</li>
    <li> i ordered the milk pencils and i love them. i emailed the seller about a problem i had and she emailed me back, which shows she cares,. the products came nicely packaged. im really happy overall&lt;br /&gt;-latasha</li>
    <li> After trying numerous bases I find that nothing beats this stuff, Especially when paired with Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer potion. I find with the duo my eye shadow will not budge and stay vibrant for a long time.</li>
    <li> Versatile oily/waxy colour that can be used on eyes, body or face. Excellent as an eye-shadow base, but also highly pigmented so can (and has) been used as white face paint. Not greasy and easily blended despite the low price. Love it!</li>
    <li> its a great base but its hard getting the product out</li>
    <li> Great to use for an eye shadow base or a highlight.Super pigmented and I love it.I ordered a set of them so I have lots of colors to play with now.</li>
    <li> Great make up. Nice shipping, Would buy again</li>
    <li> This is an amazing eye pencil. Your eyes will look gorgeous! I love love love this product. And I will keep buying this eye pencil</li>
    <li> Being exposed to a lot of bloggers who all use this product as a base for loose pigments that is the reason I ordered it. I love it - very easy to apply, controlled application without devoting a brush to primer. As for eyeliner... not really ideal, it&#x27;s a little awkward to get the fine lines I like but... that&#x27;s not why I purchased it. Invest in a jumbo sharpener</li>
    <li> Well so far this pencil does gives your eyeshadow life is a good high lighter for the conversation of your inner eye definitely a most have!!</li>
    <li> Great item just what I expected. Came fast.</li>
    <li> Great eye pencil. The white is great for the corner of your eye and for highlighting.</li>
    <li> I purchased the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in white as a holiday gift for my sister. I could not find the item in regular stores at all, even Sally&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have it. This item is worth the look, but FAR cheaper online than in Sephora. The white goes on super smooth, and I will be buying more in the future, but by no means is it worth more than $6 like makeup stores were charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the pencil is great.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product was above my expectations. Even applying a tiny amount to my eyelid did the job very well. I got this product to make my eyeshadow colors pop and it was worth it! I love the product but I love the price even more! And it arrived before it&#x27;s estimated delivery date!</li>
    <li> i have a beauty blog and i had been looking for nyx pencil for sometime and my viewers as well... i promise it pops out the colors in my eyeshadow its a must have! for more on this item visit my blog [...]</li>
    <li> Easy to apply, great matte white color, easy to blend in  - definitely would buy again</li>
    <li> Works good as an eye shadow base. There are other better ones though. Not HG.</li>
    <li> It works quite well, except I can&#x27;t find a way to sharpen it because the TIP IS VERY FAT and difficult to bring to a point.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this. Unbelievably inexpensive and with no shipping! The product itself is great... I use it as a a base for my eyeshadow... The formulation is very creamy and it makes all of my eyeshades extra vibrant. Great product that I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I love NYX and I love this jumbo I pencil it&#x27;s the best I recommend this to anyone it&#x27;s a great primer to</li>
    <li> A must have in my makeup collection.</li>
    <li> I love nyx and this pencil was really worth the money</li>
    <li> Got this for covering eyebrow color and doing eyebrow touch ups for costumes and cosplay. It works ok but if you are trying to make brown hair look blond you need something extra (glue or something else) to cover the eyebrow first so you can lay down a smooth coat of white over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen it used for coloring eyebrows pink or purple from brown though and it works ok with green.</li>
    <li> Goes on easy and lasts long but I totally shouldn&#x27;t of the jumbo one ha.. Still a great product tho!</li>
    <li> I have no idea how I survived without this!  I love a lighter eye with lots of mascara.  It&#x27;s perfect for brightening up the eye and making lashes pop!  I use some on my waterline too.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Milk color. When buying this I thought the pencil could be sharpened. It is not retractable and it is made from plastic.</li>
    <li> Love it especially to bring out the brighter, bolder colors.</li>
    <li> Clumpy, chalky and hard to use</li>
    <li> I get sweaty eye lids. I have to use Expensive eyeshadow base in order for eyeshadow to stay all day. I&#x27;m able to use this alone &amp; get the same effect. Also any eyeshadow you apply over this pops out so much better. Luving this all over eye lid, corners of eyes, water line, under eye for pop &amp; stay of eye shadow. I will be buying more for myself &amp; for gifts. A++</li>
    <li> I use this as a primer and it does a good job with making colors pop, however I have not learned how to evenly distribute and smooth this out yet.</li>
    <li> Excellent...came much faster than expected. A lot of product for the price and works really well. It goes very easily on and lasts a life time, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> ordered white.. gave me black...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do not care what color.. order it. Also, no staying power at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some of these nyx jumbo pencils in the past they do their job. Not the best at keeping creasing at bay but they do make any color you place on top much more vibrant. Milk is a good pencil, it is just your standard matte white base. With this pencil, do not apply thickly to the lid or it feel very sticky and makes applying eyeshadow much more difficult. Just lightly apply a few strokes and blend it out to a sheer finish with a brush or your fingers. Beforehand, do apply a primer potion (two face shadow insurance or ud primer potion) because even though this is a base, it does have a tendency to still crease since it is very creamy.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil and the color pay off is great. I use this to brighten up my eyeshadow colors, eyeliner, and sometimes as a base. This is a must have and it&#x27;s really great.</li>
    <li> Ive seen a lot of reviews that said this creases a lot but I decided to buy it anyways to give it a try and im glad I did. I just started making my own mineral shadows and am having trouble with the adhesion, how well they stick to my skin, and the shade milk is perfect for that.&lt;br /&gt;They will crease to the point where they melt off your face if you use them alone you need to put a pressed or mineral shadow on top. But it really does make your shadows much brighter and when used as I described will last all day. My shadow didnt even crease when I went to a school dance and I danced all night in a hot room without a primer.&lt;br /&gt;Just rub on your finger and put a VERY thin layer on your lid or water line then put a powder product after&lt;br /&gt;also good to hilight your face. Amazing product :]</li>
    <li> Love this pencil. You can use it for so many things. You can use it as a base for shadows, eyeliner, highlighting....it is just a great product. Will order again :)</li>
    <li> This is a must have for vibrant eyeshadows. And I love bright colors</li>
    <li> This pencil is great. The color is exactly as shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> NYX products can be hit or miss and this was definitely a hit! It glides on a is not goopy but it does not keep well. My pencil went bad after a couple of months of using it, the oils have seperated and it has started coming apart.</li>
    <li> I bought the NYX pencil in 604 Milk. Shipping was fast! I haven&#x27;t tried it on yet but I did rub a little on my hand and blend it out a little and I was very happy with how it looked :) I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works on top of eyeshadow primer! That white probably REALLY pops!&lt;br /&gt;Super excited to try this product and very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> Goes on well and is very much worth the money since it cost next to nothing. I just use it for an eyeshadow primer but have went most of my life without using a primer so I really don&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Great primer, to achieve great results blend well when apply.. It did arrived on time.. Great product!!</li>
    <li> very cheap but hate that you cannot sharpen it.&lt;br /&gt;Have to depot into a container to get to use all the product</li>
    <li> I love this product very creamy , I wanna order it again 👌☺</li>
    <li> This shadow is easy to apply, makes a perfect eyeshadow base, and is impossibly convenient. I never put on makeup without it!&lt;br /&gt;You need an NYX sharpener in order to utilize the full stick, or else you should de-pot them. A worthwhile investment in my opinion, because it is my absolute go-to.</li>
    <li> Seeing as I typically only use MAC products, I was not really expecting too much - which is good because I didn&#x27;t really get too much!  First of all, you do not get much product with this.  I was thinking \\&quot;Whatever, five bucks is cheap!\\&quot; But it would take like 6 of these to equal ONE paint pot, so it&#x27;s not really cheaper in that sense.  But more importantly, this product CREASES.... massively.  I think that creasing *can* look good on black make-up, but white... not so much.  This means I needed to do tons of upkeep (which I personally hate to do).  So I would recommend this only for short periods of wear.  Anyways, good luck!</li>
    <li> Everyone Has Been Raving About How Good this Product is !&lt;br /&gt;(The Milk Jumbo Pencil)&lt;br /&gt;Either As A Base For Eyeshdaow OR Perfect For The Water Line !&lt;br /&gt;Either Way it Worked GREAT ON ME !!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived VERY QUICK ! &amp; Also Came With A Little Gift ;)&lt;br /&gt;MOST DEFF Will Be re-Purchasing irecommend This To Any Makeup LOVERS</li>
    <li> These pencils are awesome.  I have one in milk, which I bought to whiten my face for halloween looks.  It worked great and stayed put all day.  I also bought a black one for the eye area, and I was surprised it stayed because I have really oily eyelids.  So all in all, for the money, quality and quantity these are totally worth it and I&#x27;ll probably be buying many MANYY more colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took me awhile to figure out: you SHARPEN these with a pencil sharpener.  Even though it seems like plastic, the inside is actually wood.</li>
    <li> I like this pencil is creamy and very rich in color the only thing is, it&#x27;s hard to sharpen other than that is good</li>
    <li> This is a major ripoff.  The product you can use is just the point, which is the size of a pea.  You cannot sharpen it, because the case is plastic coated.  It doesn&#x27;t have a twist up mechanism.  What you see is what you get, maybe enough for two or three uses.  Sorry, but I don&#x27;t pay this much for two or three uses of anything.  NYX must be high.  One reviewer suggests we depot the product.  Sorry, but homie don&#x27;t play that.  I shouldn&#x27;t have to modify a product, just to be able to use it all.  I saw a YouTube video suggesting that freezing the pencil will make it easier to sharpen.  Again, NYX should provide a usable product, not one that is extremely difficult to dispense.  It&#x27;s a shame, too, because I like the actual product, just not the packaging.  I&#x27;ll buy another brand that allows me more than just a few uses, one in which there is more than a pea size amount of usable product.  I honestly don&#x27;t get the rave reviews.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking to use this on your waterline to enhance how big your eyes look, this is a good product, but it&#x27;s way cheaper in a store. It&#x27;s very long-lasting, and actually takes a lot of effort to take off, even with Pond&#x27;s cold cream. I haven&#x27;t sharpened it yet, but was told that placing it in the freezer helps the sharpening to go more smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have bought so many other products that I wanted to do exactly what this one does but did not. This product goes on smooth and creamy, I don&#x27;t have to heat it up to be able to line my eyes like the other makeup product I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait until I am able to get the rest of colors they have.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the price. I use it to as an eye shadow base to help make the shadows more vibrant. Other than that the shipping was fast and I would defiantly buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I own the Jumbo Eye Pencil in the shade Milk which is a stark white that is strictly a cream.&lt;br /&gt;As for being a base, it works really well. The color blends onto the lid very easily while still retaining the color to help eyeshadows pop.&lt;br /&gt;I got about 6 hours with using this as a base before it creased, which is saying a lot for me because my eyelids are very wrinkly and oily.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other colors yet, but I think that these would do just fine as a base or own their own!</li>
    <li> It looks like smeared chalk. Greasy and forms layers/strikes on skin, does not apply well at all.</li>
    <li> I often use it as a base for eyeshadow. All though i&#x27;m not a good make up artist, the product itself is good.</li>
    <li> This is an absolute must have for any make up artist, self make up or regular make up artist tool!  It is wonderful for the inner corners of the eyes, or brow bone, and wonderful base!</li>
    <li> this is a must have, i use it as a base and my shadows don&#x27;t crease and my colors pop!!! Who knew that white shadow would make a chocolate girl like myself fall in love with the many colors of the rainbow. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and decided to buy more so that I can depot it and put it in a pan. I use it daily.</li>
    <li> Beautiful creamy pencil.  Largely use for a base but can be used on their own.  Milk is great for your water line making your eye look larger.</li>
    <li> So I ordered 4 of these, I got 2 in dark brown and 2 in milk and I love them! They even arrived ahead of schedule which was nice. the only problem was that one of the milk colored pencils didn&#x27;t have a cap so the pencil kind of got smeared on the inside of the box. Soooo the pencils were poorly packaged but the product works really well and I don&#x27;t see myself using any other pencil :)</li>
    <li> It is a good eyeshadow base.</li>
    <li> i like the pigmentation but it was kind of gloppy. and it is really hard to find a sharpener. otherwise it was pretty awesome??</li>
    <li> This is great for making your eyeshadows stay pigmented when applying them. I would not use this without a primer. It blends out easy but its also easy to put on too much which may cause creasing. So I usually just put on a few dots, blend it and if I need more then I add more. I love that this base doesn&#x27;t make it hard to blend out the eyeshadows you put on, which has happened with products like this from other brands. I will be buying this again once I run out.</li>
    <li> I purchased the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in the color Milk when I was out shopping with friends. I had heard lots of good things about this product, and I was excited to try it out for myself. I started using it right away, and I am generally pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of uses for this product. I use this pencil (in milk) to provide a base for my eye shadow, to line my water line, and I also occasionally use it as an inner eye highlight and a brow bone highlight. I have heard that these pencils can be used on your lips, but I have not tried it with this pencil, given the color. It does make my eye shadow stand out more, however, it does not prevent my eye shadow from creasing. I would recommend using this pencil over a primer if your eye shadow creases easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read other reviews saying that the pencils are chalky, and when I first bought mine it was. I swiped the color on the back of my hand a couple of times before applying it for the first time, and since then I have not had a problem with the product appearing chalky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also blends relatively easily. After I swipe it on my eyelid I blend it out with my finger so it isn&#x27;t such a harsh white and I&#x27;m all set to apply my eye shadow. If the color was one that I used as a eye shadow itself, I would definitely expect it to look great as well, seeing as how easily it blends out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend, but I only give it 4 stars because I wish it would keep my eye shadow from creasing. Other than that, this is a great product.</li>
    <li> Great for a base or to line your water line to give a fuller effect for the eyes. Can crease so make sure to apply the shadow on top of it right after you smudge it on your eyelid. I own every single color, as I am a makeup artist, so if you are looking for a base to darker shadows I suggest getting Jumbo pencils closer to the shadow color.</li>
    <li> I use this for highlighting my eyes to make them look a little bigger. It really blends well with other shadows and even my concealer when I smudge.</li>
    <li> Staple in my make up collection!!! I wear this EVERY day. It is an awesome base for eyeshadows. It helps to make the colors really pop and last a lot longer. I am actually at the BOTTOM of one of these pencils, I have used it and sharpened it down that much that I need a replacement and I will without a shred of hesitation be repurchasing this again and again. Super reasonable pricing and awesome quality. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I just got this in the mail, and my first time using it I absolutely love it!  It goes on smooth, its blendable, and it has the perfect amount of white pigment to give you that highlighted look.  So happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This eye pencil is so versatile. It can be used as an eye shadow base, brow bone and inner tear duct highlighter, concealer and just a plain old eye shadow. It&#x27;s so creamy and blends so well. The pencil glides right on your eye. I am very glad I purchased this product and will be purchasing more colors!</li>
    <li> Soft, easy and a tip; if you want to sharpen it, put it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, the use a jumbo pencil sharpener. That will make it much much easier and lead to great results!</li>
    <li> Does what it says it is supposed to do and is great to use as a base and or primer for eyeshadow. Would totally recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I received my nyx jumbo eye pencil and love it I definitely will be ordering more just wish I was able to track my order</li>
    <li> Another Lauren Curtis (youtube) favorite!!! Use on my waterline and especially in the morning when I look sleep and WOW!!!! Does wonders!</li>
    <li> love it, great on my medium skin tone. i&#x27;m a Mexican teen :) hope that helps anyone. I absolutely love it as a base.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best for eye primer, or just a nice white eye shadow, n love the eyeliner part where I actually use this for a eye liner, my eyes look so bright!</li>
    <li> Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Works great as an eyeshadow base, but especially for bright colored shadows! Really helps the colors pop!</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed too! I use this as a base for my eye-shadow and not only does it makes the color last, but it makes it pop! Great product that lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Loooooove. This is a must have! Perfect base for bright colors. word limit word limit word limit word limit word limit</li>
    <li> Do not plan on using this as a base if you&#x27;re applying a metallic shadow over it, UNLESS you like the &amp;#34;crumpled up tin foil&amp;#34; look. I prefer to set it with a nude matte shadow (&amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Buck&amp;#34; from the original Naked palette are my two choices) and THEN follow it with my metallic shadow</li>
    <li> Wooooow I am so surprised at some of the negative reviews, I love this product and highly recommend.  Yes its plastic and it CAN be sharpened, yes there are sharpners out there generic brand that work to sharpen it, yes it is very creamy, thats the part I LOVE, if it smears perhaps its your skin type or the moisturizer you applied prior? I have dry skin, and it has never smeared or creased, I dont use primer I just put it on thats it, I&#x27;ve had mine for a year and its still creamy, does not smear, I swipe once across and it goes on perfectly, still give it 5 :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow, but I use it on my clients and it works wonders! Before I apply the ELF eyeshadow, i put this on and the eyeshadow sticks to it amazingly! definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> very great product! of course you have to crease cuz it will crease like a mofo but amazing under shadows will make colors pop and the packaging was amazing they did a great job so it wont get ruined!</li>
    <li> I thought the pencil was a full size. It turns out it only about an inch of product. So disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I bought it with the E.L.F. palette because a reviewer recommended it. It works great over or under eyeshadow, or even by itself with a little black eyeliner for a dramatic effect. It goes on smooth and has lasted me several months so far.</li>
    <li> Works great! Really makes my eyeshadow pop. Definitely a MUST if you like to wear eyeshadow, it makes it so much brighter.</li>
    <li> Oh my goodness I can not give this thing enough praise!! It makes any colors of eyeshadow you may be using just pop!! Even if they are hardly pigmented, this can help you get them to look amazing!! Also it holds the shadow on for many many hours!! Keeping it vibrant and highly noticeably beautiful!! I will never use another eyelid base ever again. This is THE BEST I have ever tried.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I needed a bold white base to make some insane anime eyes for SakuraCon (a local Northwest convention). This eye stick did not disappoint. I will now be purchasing these for every convention that I ever go to, and recommending it to everyone I know! It is really bright and pops. Also, I loved the size and the big thick lines I created with it!</li>
    <li> They crease and do not last longer than 2 hours. watch my review on youtube to see swatches and to see my opinion of them : [...]</li>
    <li> Really makes my eyes pop. Lasts a decent time.</li>
    <li> Words can&#x27;t explain my love for this pencil....&lt;br /&gt;I wear it alone, under eyeshadow (base) or in the inner corners of eyes for that extra glow.&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love this pencil.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liner! I use it to brighten my eyes in the morning when I look really tired. It really helps my eyes pop and makes me look more awake.</li>
    <li> I use this as a highlighter underneath my foundation and it stays all day without looking cakey. You can also use it on your eyelids underneath eyeshadow to help colors pop! If you have sensitive skin  beware putting this on areas that are prone to break out because the formula is  bit heavy. However, if you just use it as a highlighter, I cannot imagine it causing any issues! I love this just as much as any higher end highlighter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing eye shadow on my eyelids for years. The color always seemed to pop for me. However, after I used this eye pencil below the colors, they pop like never before. I love it. plus it goes on so smoothly without me even having to press down too much. It&#x27;s going to last me a while too because a little goes a long way with this.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but just to put it out there... this product is not retractable or nor can it be sharpen. I just thought that this was very unfortunate because  the point is so short. The pigmentation is very smooth and very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a really good primer, I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times. Brings out the colours of eyeshadow. Great product :)</li>
    <li> A great product.  Use to line the lower water line to brighten up your eyes, or even as a primer on your top lid!</li>
    <li> Yessss honey if you want your eyeshadow to pop this is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Glides on smooth no creasing and holds those vibrant colors in place alllll day I&#x27;m an eyeshadow addict and I&#x27;m in love&lt;br /&gt;With this pencil!!! They seem to go hand in hand grab one downside is it&#x27;s impossible to sharpen but I just depot it&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> Great as a background on top of my lid primer.  Colors pop! I tried using it as a lower lid liner on my water line, but the pencil seems too inaccurate due to its size and softness of the point.  I seem to just make an uneven mess.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intent of using it as an eyeshadow base over my primer, to bring out the color in some slightly less pigmented eyeshadows I have. I&#x27;ll say first and foremost- it works wonderfully for that purpose. It made my Naked 3 eyeshadow look pop! My only issue is that, at first, it isn&#x27;t very creamy. You really have to press at your eye and try a lot for it to smear on. But it seems to get easier and easier the more you use it. I&#x27;ll be using this regularly, and will buy again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it on March 16th, and it was delivered by March 21st. So, pretty quick! All in all, I&#x27;m very pleased. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love this product, I use it and a eye shadow primer it works great and makes colors more vibrant because of the white color</li>
    <li> This is a great base for any bright eye shadows that you want to really pop. It acts as a matte primer.</li>
    <li> This pencil works great. It goes on smooth, perfect for using before you put on eyeshadow to really make the colors pop.</li>
    <li> I really love this product, its the perfect shade for me and now my eye makeup stays flawless from when I apply it to when I remove it. I love it and highly recommend it. One of the best purchases I have ever made.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s literally like putting solid milk on your eyelids. It&#x27;s super thick and bright. Just wonderful. I use it on my water lines, and it stays for hours. Great quality.</li>
    <li> The color is a nice flat white. You can apply it in a nice wide swath or a somewhat concentrated line (if you keep it sharpened). As soon as I got it, I began incorporating it into my daily makeup routine. I use it as an eyeshadow base and it makes my eyeshadow stand out like WHAM!!! Also nice for lining the water line for that doe-eyed anime effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely jumbo. The pencil is too big for most sharpeners, which is annoying. You have to get the NYX special sharpener. I think you can also melt the filling out into a sample jar if you don&#x27;t want to get the sharpener, but that sounds like more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. The pencil makes the application much easier anyway, so the sharpener is worth it in my humble opinion.</li>
    <li> I use this item as base for eyeshadows. I purchased other colors at the time I got this one. Great!</li>
    <li> As a first time user of a jumbo eye pencil shadow liner, I really loved this liner. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this....it&#x27;s smooth and creamy...works great on it&#x27;s own or using it as a primer....I bought another one just the other day in black....NYX never disappoints for it&#x27;s prices</li>
    <li> I really love this jumbo eye pencil in milk. I use it as an eye primer before I put on my eyeshadow. It&#x27;s works great! It gives my shadow something to stick to, and keeps it from creasing or fading. Love!</li>
    <li> I use this pencil EVERY DAY.keeps ur eye shadows in place ALL day.need 2 order another one b4 I run out.makes bright shadows show op better on dark skin tones</li>
    <li> It creases within a few hours even if I use a eyelid primer.  will not purchase again will stick to powder</li>
    <li> I love this eye pencil. It applys evenly on you eye line and lasts about half of the day. I love it</li>
    <li> I bought this product intentionally to be a base for other eyeshadows to pop more and stay on longer and it went above and beyond expectations! it sharpens easily with the NYX sharpener and appliees easily with a creamy texture.</li>
    <li> This is a great, soft but not too soft, eye pencil.  The color is bright but not garish, and with free shipping, definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this jumbo eye pencil. It is great quality and the pigmentation it is great. Perfect for highlighting the eyes</li>
    <li> Great eye shadow base! Really gives life to the lid color!</li>
    <li> My favorite base for eyeshadow.. Makes colors pop and no creasing</li>
    <li> a must have for my makeup drawer.</li>
    <li> great stuff! got to my door in less than24hours... wow</li>
    <li> I love NYX. The pencil arrived quickly and is just as expected.</li>
    <li> I love it.. it doesn&#x27;t come off unless you scrub your face very well. Don&#x27;t wait, if your considering buying this eyeliner,  just go for it, you won&#x27;t regret it.  And shipping was ver fast.:-)</li>
    <li> I use this from everything from an eyeshadow base to a highlighter.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing 10 more.</li>
    <li> this is that product that all the makeup artists on youtube are using. it works great as a base for lipstick, as eyeliner, or as a base for eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> great, i like it, impossible to sharpin, i like these a lot. Very creamy and opaque. Love to use as an eyeliners!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The color is very opaque and shows up great! I use it as an eyeshadow base and on my water line to make my eyes appear bigger. I love love love love love it!!!! Definitely a great buy!!</li>
    <li> It keeps my eye shadow on all day. the only thing is that if you don&#x27;t apply eye shadow right away it starts to melt but its a good product will be buying again</li>
    <li> I had no problems with this order. It arrived quickly and safely. Other than that, I love this product. It is good as a primer.</li>
    <li> This pen is a damn life saver!! It holds the shadow in place!! Love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great as a base for my eyeshadow. I don&#x27;t get creasing and the white color helps my shadow pop. Wouldn&#x27;t get it to use as actual eyeliner though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this stuff. The ONLY con is that it runs out fast. I don&#x27;t over use it but I do use it a lot. I have bought many of these from Ulta, and Amazon and it has always been great. It makes makeup stand out even more than with primer especially if you are going for a light eye with smokey eye around it. Looks Beautiful. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I use this as an eyeshadow base under all of my bright colored shadows and it makes them even more intense and vibrant. No creasing when applied correctly and I have oily skin so that is really amazing. Want to buy all of the colors!</li>
    <li> You can use this for so many reasons. Put this on your lid before applying eye shadow and it makes the color more pigmented and vibrant. Its also great for eyeliner to create the wide eye look.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyeliner for my lower waterline. It&#x27;s so soft and applies somewhat thick, so my eyes aren&#x27;t irritated. I plan to get the one in &#x27;black bean&#x27; as well, I recommend this eyeliner 100%. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
    <li> I read this XOJane article (http://www.xojane.com/beauty/use-this-450-eye-pencil-to-make-your-lipstick-last) that talked about using this eye pencil to enhance and lock in lip color. The result? Amazing! It really does work. I used this during my national conference a few weeks ago. I decided to wear my signature hot pink lipstick every day. Using this product, my lips popped with color and I was able to go a whole day without needing to touch it up much or worry about it fading.</li>
    <li> Cult classic. Brightens any shadow you put over it, or you can wear it in the waterline top open up the eyes.</li>
    <li> Love this as bow highlight and inner rim highlight with my very fair skin.</li>
    <li> Not really water proof.  Good transaction</li>
    <li> Great product, works well and helps eyeshadow look amazing. Love it. will definitely order this product again. glad it comea in many colors.</li>
    <li> This is a nice base for light and bright shadows. Sadly, it creases, even with a primer under it which really bums me out because I don&#x27;t have oily lids. I&#x27;ll use it until I find a better quality white shadow base that works better.</li>
    <li> I use it as a eyeshadow primer and it keeps my eyeshadow on. I am not sure if that was its original purpose.</li>
    <li> I always research products before buying them - regardless if I buy them online or through a store -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve had white eye pencils before but this NYX is the best, by FAR. I started to line my waterline with this jumbo pencil in milk and while other white eye pencils fade or make you look like an alien, NYX has a perfect formula that stays on all day AND doesn&#x27;t make you look crazy (it&#x27;s not so incredibly white it washes you out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is affordable and definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the shipping, too. It took about 3 days after placing my order!</li>
    <li> This is a great liner to use on your whole eyelid as a base color or to even add to the waterline to make your eyes appear bigger. It&#x27;s a product I&#x27;ve always used come Halloween time finding it so much easier to work with than cheap face paints sold at party stores. It can also be used as a brow highlighter which I love. Very versatile product.</li>
    <li> My cheapish eyeshadow (elf) stayed put all day through high 90s-100F heat. Incredible!</li>
    <li> Quite a few people mentioned melting or smearing but I haven&#x27;t had this problem. I&#x27;m not rubbing at my eyes, either. This pencil works as a great base if you want colors to pop, or if used correctly, is also a great highlighter. It makes no claims to be water proof, so if you&#x27;re hot and sweating, maybe that&#x27;s why it melts. It&#x27;s August here in Texas, and I still haven&#x27;t had problems with it.</li>
    <li> It creased on my eye lid. I have oily lids. It might be good for folks with dry skin. Will not repurchase this item. I find NYX cosmetics to be in poor quality, including their customer service, and will not purchase any of their products any more.</li>
    <li> This milk pencil is an amazing lid primer! Whenever I use it as a base, I can easily get light neon shadow colors to stand out. It&#x27;s very soft and creamy; you can apply it with a brush or the pencil itself without any problems. This is now one of my most essential makeup products.</li>
    <li> Like this product and vendor. They sent same color and easily exchanged for correct product. I recommend this vendor and product!</li>
    <li> It makes the colors pop but it does not dry it stays wet and the eye shadow goes every where</li>
    <li> The eye liner itself is good quality, especially for the price. I usually shop online because i dont have time to hit the stores sometimes. Its eye liner, what could possibly go wrong? I got it today in the mail. I opened the package and to my disappointment it was snapped in half. It didnt bother me that much, but if i didnt have to pay extra money for shiipping it wouldn&#x27;t have bothered me, They sell NYX products at Target now, so im just going to do that. The liner itself is good, good white pigment, creamy.</li>
    <li> it was broken when I got it in the mail and it does not turn up</li>
    <li> it looks soooooooooooo..... nice under my bright shadow colors</li>
    <li> Really high pigmented liner. Perfect for costume makeup.</li>
    <li> ok so i heard about this product and decided to try it for myself.. i LOVE it. the item came to me SUPER fast.. the seller packed it up nice and secure! i HIGHLY recommend this seller and i will be buying more from Msss Kel in the near future! you go girl! GREAT bid-ness! lol 5 stars :)</li>
    <li> You can use this as an eyeliner, highlight, eyeshaodw base, or as an eyeshadow alone! It make colors pop and is very easy and fun to use, I would recommend this to anybody who uses eyeshadow and like their colors to be bold. I only have the white right now, but I will definitely be purchasing more colors soon! (packaging was great)</li>
    <li> I liked this item but i didn&#x27;t love it. It&#x27;s alright. I used it as concealer but you have to blend it in real good otherwise you will look like you have a white ring around your eyes.</li>
    <li> It seemed to sit on top of my skin and slide around through the day which was disappointing because it had been touted almost as a primer to give a clean base to make shadows brighter.  I even have dry skin that usually absorbs product so I don&#x27;t usually have this problem.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It was exactly what I wanted or even more. You can use it as plain white eye shadow or put it as a base on your eyelids for more pigmented colors. I use it more as a base color, and saying I love it is an understatement. I might even seek to buy the whole collection of colors.</li>
    <li> I was surprised how small the pencil was. And you dont even get that much. So i wouldnt buy it again...</li>
    <li> U can&#x27;t go wrong with this pencils bright colors seam to pop and make your eyes so viverant it&#x27;s unbelievable</li>
    <li> This sucks ass! My pencil took about a week to get here AND when it got here it was broken! Never again&#x27;! Ef you!</li>
    <li> I practically worship this eyeliner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this for an eyeshadow base, eyeliner for big dolly eyes, and highlighting under my eyes. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT for all of those uses!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Since it&#x27;s very creamy, it doesn&#x27;t sharpen well. To fix this, Freeze for 15-20 minutes before attempting to sharpen. Sharpens well and goes right back to it&#x27;s normal consistency!</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve heard so many good reviews and appraisals about this product, and to be honest I was beyond excited to use it to make my eye make up POP this Christmas. But I never got the product I waited a week and it&#x27;s not here yet my tracking says it&#x27;s been delivered. Until I get my item I&#x27;ll stand with one star.</li>
    <li> I have trouble finding products that will stay on my lids let alone in my waterline. My eyes water a lot and are shaped in just a way that product that doesn&#x27;t set up right away smudges and moves. All that being said this product is great! Barely budges in my waterline. I like to use it as a primer on my lids too, makes the eyeshadow colors more vivid and true to color.</li>
    <li> very rich color. i use this as a second eye primer if im going to use bright colors so the colors are more vivid.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t use it but I like it!</li>
    <li> There was so many sad mornings watching this Boston Terrier feel incomplete without eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;NYX is the perfect consistency for his short fur. It lasts through an entire day at the dog park, napping in the sun and barking at the windows.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you NYX for giving this sweet boy his confidence back.</li>
    <li> If I could leave a no star rating I would. There was no safty seal on this. Looks like someone used it and tried to depot it since the whole bottom is cracked off. Ita sad because it looks like the seller knew, thats why its covered it tape. I would not mind if the tip was untouched. There is lines and discoloration on the tip. It is unsanitary, there is no way I could use this product. If the seller can make this right I can post an up date. Nyx is an amazing brand the jumbo pencil is just what you need to make any eyeshadow pop. I will continue to buy nyx products. I can never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This product works really well when applied with your fingertips. I purchased this product to use before i applied my eyeshadow. It really does make my eyeshadow appear vibrant. My only con is that it can come out a little thick. So i use a little, then build upon it.</li>
    <li> I have a few of the NYX jumbo pencils in different colors I love them all. I use them as a base for my eyeshadow  it really makes the color pop...would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> I love this product so much. I was excited to get this product. When i used it it was perfect. I love it, i would defiantly  recommend everyone to order this jumbo pencil. Love it, love it, love it. :) very satisfied.</li>
    <li> muito bom, ouvia varias coisas na Internet sobre o produto e pude comprovar quando comprei, &amp;eacute; muito bom e não vivo  mais sem ele... .</li>
    <li> Great for a base and out of corner highlighting although I don&#x27;t use it everyday, I still love it. I wouldn&#x27;t mind reordering it.</li>
    <li> i love this product, its creamy and goes on great but how do i sharpen it to get more product or did pay $6 for a tiny bit of product?</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a whitening base for my eye shadow for a few months now, i was suggested this product and thought it works great for my skin tone, since I have a dark complexion it works great when I want to wear brighter colors for my eyes. It goes on smooth I didn&#x27;t like how it doesn&#x27;t seem to advance out of the tube, its almost like its stuck. other than that, I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> Nyx Jumbo pencil in &amp;#34;Milk&amp;#34; is absolutly fantastic. In the photos I&#x27;ve posted I used the product from lid to brow bone. I makes the whites whiter, and the colors brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jumbo pencil glides on smoothly when you apply and is quite creamy. Once you smooth it a bit with your finger you&#x27;re ready to go. Pat  your eyeshadow on top to set the cream and once you&#x27;ve done an initial layer of shadow you can begin blending out the colors or lack thereof as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencil sharpens easily as the shell is made of plastic. All you need is a jumbo pencil sharpener. If you prefer it in a pot all you have to do is microwave or use a blow dryer to melt the product down into whatever container you&#x27;d like. (Use caution)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product multiple times and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
    <li> This is a must have which I use as a primer for my eyes!!! Good price and I received it well packaged!</li>
    <li> Great pencil!!  Eye shadows look more intense and gorgeous! Would definitely buy more! ..</li>
    <li> Got here very fast. Glides on very nicely and silky. Would recommend to anyone. Last awhile as well.. :) :)</li>
    <li> I use this white nyx jumbo pencil as a primer for my eyeshadows.  It does a good job of keeping the eyeshadow vibrant and does not cake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll order more love this product really really do got it quick and in one piece no damage for a great price too...</li>
    <li> I use this as a base in lieu of primer and it works like a dream! Pigments and powder alike stick to this with ease. It doesn&#x27;t crease and stays on all day. It also looks great alone or smudged across the lid for a more subtle effect. A+ product!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to do my boyfriends mad hatter look for Halloween. The pencil applies very smoothly and a little goes a long way! It lasted all night never creased or ran. Very good product!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT REALLY HIGHLIGHT YOUR EYESHADOWS BRIGHTER AND ALSO IT LAST ALL DAY ON, NO CRACKS IN THE COLOUR OF YOUR EYESHADOW AT ALL........&lt;br /&gt;A GOOD BUY, DIFFERENTLY WILL TRY OTHER COLORS..</li>
    <li> Shipping is so fast, I literally got it the next day! They certainly don&#x27;t waste any time getting it out there! This is a really great product, super creamy and really qives a nice opaque white. I love it and I&#x27;ll be using it lots!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.</li>
    <li> Love it! Smooth, glides on, brightens your eyes.</li>
    <li> It is nicely packaged; unbroken and unused; arrived at a descent time frame after order was placed and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing!! I love to use the one in milk ! :) I use it every single day since I&#x27;ve gotten it, the only down side is that I can&#x27;t find a sharpener big enough for it.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed before eyeshadow</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this pencil. I use it as a base coat for my Urban Decay Electric palette and it makes the colors pop!</li>
    <li> I ordered this pencil because I needed a white eyeliner that would stay. This does and I was super surprised that I received the item within just a few days! Super fast shipping is always a plus and now I want to check out other colors. I know that they say his item is mineral based but there are still parabens listed in the ingredients. This didn&#x27;t surprise me and I&#x27;m not deducting any stars for it. I would defiantly recommend to anyone needing a super creamy, versitle eye pencil!</li>
    <li> This is a super liner / shadow/ base.&lt;br /&gt;It is super pigmented..which is so hard to find in white.&lt;br /&gt;Works great also for a shadow base.&lt;br /&gt;layer this before your bright colors and it will pop like crazy.</li>
    <li> As others have mentioned before, it has a very blendable, creamy texture and I love it. This is my first time purchasing and using the product and I would definitely buy it again. I&#x27;m actually using this on my face and neck as a white base for costume makeup (since my skin is sensitive and I get reactions from many different body paints). It goes on really smoothly, especially with a makeup sponge. Love love love!</li>
    <li> I love this eye pencil. Not only does it work as a great blended base for eye shadow, but it doubles as a wonderful dark circle &amp;#34;remover&amp;#34;. What I do is use this pencil under my eye, following the dark circle pattern and then blend downward from my nose toward my cheek. Use BB cream of my skin shade on top, blend, and voila! No more dark circles for me.</li>
    <li> I bought jumbo pencils some time ago, as the ladies raved about them on their blogs.  I bought yogurt, sparkle nude and French fries, based on online reviews alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many ways you can use these chubby sticks, which have inspired many met-too products.  You can use them as liners, as a shadow base, a stand-alone eyeshadow, as a highlighter and to line your waterline. It really depends upon you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find yogurt to be a very versatile product, even though it&#x27;s a baby pink shade when swatched, which seems unsuitable.  I use it on the lids to perk up the eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t look like I am wearing makeup (atleast from afar).  It&#x27;s also very good as a cheek highlighter, no need to buy a separate product.  It also works well as a great eye shadow base, given its creamy texture and light color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sparkle nude has chunky glitter so it doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly.  French Fries works great as a liner, for all skin shades.  For darker skin tones, it&#x27;ll perk up your eyes with a no-makeup look and for light skin tones, it&#x27;ll work as a subtle brown liner.  It&#x27;s also quite handy as a base for a bronze smoky eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more pencils in Milk and Pots and Pans.  Looking forward to using them.</li>
    <li> Nice! Worth the price!</li>
    <li> goes on smooth and easy to distribute to any area of the eye. really good base to put down for bright colors to go on top because it makes them pop out more. also great as a highlighter (color : milk).</li>
    <li> great large white pencil.</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that it is horrible at staying put, it smudges, runs, and creases......WHERE IS ALL OF THE PRODUCT???? You literally have to go through the trouble of de-potting this pencil to get ANY useful amount of product. I thought it had a twist-up bottom.....NOPE! So all you get is what you see and that little bit dulls fast. I guess you could use a eye liner brush to dig it out, but for $6, it shouldn&#x27;t be that hard!!!!</li>
    <li> It goes on really smooth. I needed a white eye pencil and this is perfect, inexpensive and looks great when applied.</li>
    <li> This particular liner in Milk has become a classic and a staple for every girl who loves make-up. There are tons of youtube vids featuring it and it&#x27;s a must have if you wanna do anything &amp;#34;anime&amp;#34; or close to it. Very versatile for so many uses...&lt;br /&gt;The quality is exceptional: it glides on smooth and thick and the coverage is awesome. No wonder people love it and it&#x27;s such a great seller.</li>
    <li> This is a really good base color the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to all friend that need you help with eye shadow fading by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Great eyeliner.... just what I expected/wanted... so versatile too. Can use for priming the eyes or as an eyeliner. Recommend :)</li>
    <li> i love this pencil and it makes your eye shadow really pop. so awesome. i just dont know how to sharpen it or get more out the tube when its down to the base. that is the bad part but i love this</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this, but boy was I surprised. I purchased \\&quot;milk\\&quot; and I was amazed how easily it glides on your eyelids! I use it to highlight my brow bone, and I just swipe a line then blend it with my fingers. I will definitely buy more colors in this, maybe in black. Great product and very affordable! I totally recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect for highlighting the brow bone or corner of eye if you have fair skin. Also great as a eyeshadow base for a great pop of color.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite go-to to make my eyeshadows pop. It&#x27;s so easy to apply and blend with ANY shade or brand of eyeshadow. I will definitely be reordering.</li>
    <li> Perfect and not fake  Just like the one that you would buy at the store but cheaper  I love using it for iner eyes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not  being paid to write the good things about this product my opinions are my own</li>
    <li> I absolutely live this pencil! It really makes your eye shadow&#x27;s pop!</li>
    <li> very bold white. works great on both your water line and skin.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these pencils after so many beauty blogs mentioned using them as eye primers. I have very dark eyelids, and have trouble getting light colors to look right. &#x27;Milk&#x27; as an opaque white primer that intensifies and holds shadows all day? Sign me up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pencils are quite pigmented, especially &#x27;Milk&#x27;. But they are a bit greasy, too. My lids are very greasy, so they don&#x27;t set up as nicely for me as for a lot of folks. And I started using them in hot weather (I&#x27;m outside all the time), and my shadows were all running together. We did have a couple of days with cool weather, though, and they worked great for me all day, so in fall/winter I&#x27;ll be using them all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with &#x27;Milk&#x27;, I also ordered &#x27;Lavender&#x27;, &#x27;Gold&#x27;, and &#x27;Lime&#x27;. The gold is excellent, although quite a bit darker than the color chart showed. The &#x27;Lime&#x27; is not as yellow/green as it looked; the frost gives it a silver cast but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the green shadow colors much when they are put on top of it. &#x27;Lavender&#x27; is a really light, super frosted color that wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for; it doesn&#x27;t really give a purple base but it does lighten up my dark lids nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably end up buying a couple more colors, but I do wish the color chart was a little more accurate.</li>
    <li> i bought it to use it in my waterline. it runs on really smoothly but doesn&#x27;t last two hours... still good price, good buy.</li>
    <li> Love this!!! This is great for so many things when I do my makeup</li>
    <li> better than i thought it will be. great product,easy to work with</li>
    <li> I was contemplating on whether I should buy this or not because I&#x27;ve been wanting to for the longest time. I have to say this is a great product and I do recommend it. I definitely going to be buying this again!</li>
    <li> It is very vibrant white when applied to the eyelid. It is somewhat sticky, which I like because I use it before I apply my eye shadows so their colors show up better. I am pale skinned, but I think it would serve this purpose even better if you had dark skin. All the different eye shadow colors you have would show up so much better on your eyelid. :)</li>
    <li> Came to find the product on here because the NYX website said they were out of the Jumbo Eye Pencil in \\&quot;milk\\&quot; so i ordered it here. The product came in fast &amp; well packaged :) &amp; the pencil itself is amazing. soft and goes on so easily! i cant wait to use it..might order more in different colors!</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and goes on great. Not for me however since it does leak down onto the lash line and gives the illusion of eye boogers and crustys</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting this eye shadow pencil forever and so glad that I finally broke down and bought it. It is the perfect white shade for highlighting under your brows, for using on your water line to make your eyes appear more open High recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I love the color but it smears within a hour of wearing. Have to find a primer strong enough for the color to stay</li>
    <li> LOve this thing.  Use it everyday!  Going to get more when I run out.  Must get when possible!! Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> very opaque and creamy. will buy again</li>
    <li> Well i don&#x27;t know why all the youtube girls like this so much, yeah it brights up any color you use on top of it but it sill creases like any other cream you would put on your lids and i use this with the NYX shadow base so...yeah whatever</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t really all that great. honestly. you get what you pay for I guess</li>
    <li> i like this product but it doesnt stay very well on oily lids.  other than that the only real problem i have with it- idk how to sharpen it.  its too big for any sharpener.</li>
    <li> I bought my Nyx jumbo eye pencil a month ago now, and I still find myself asking why I didn&#x27;t get it sooner. What finally made me decide to purchase it were the great reviews I was seeing on Youtube. The shade I bought this in was was milk, and it&#x27;s excellent for making eyeshadow colors really pop and stay put. I&#x27;ve slowly replaced my MAC paint pots with this little guy, simply because it *just about* works as good as they did and it costs so much less. I&#x27;ve been using my pencil at least once a week, and I still haven&#x27;t needed to sharpen it. Safe to say, one pencil will last a very long time. I highly recommend everyone try this at least once. You can&#x27;t beat the color payoff, or the price.</li>
    <li> This product really works well . Long lasting color .&lt;br /&gt;lasts all day .&lt;br /&gt;will be repurchasing ..&lt;br /&gt;Nice Color</li>
    <li> So i ordered the nyx jumbo eye pencils because they were incredibly cheap and i had hear many good things about it. super impressed...love this product</li>
    <li> Very soft and blends wonderfully. Use it for everything. Not just my eyes.</li>
    <li> The most amazing inner eye corner highlighting pencil. It gives such a beautiful shimmery glow to the eye.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly as shown, no complaints!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth. Nice and bright. I bought it to coat my lids before applying my eye shadow. Looks great. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite nyc pencil in fact l love all their products but this one has solo many uses so its the best</li>
    <li> This is a great deal, and the shipping was super fast! Love the liner, I use it as an eyeshadow base and to make my eye makeup more vibrant, this does the trick!</li>
    <li> I sort of like the product but I&#x27;ve had a lot more trouble than other reviewers.  First it simply won&#x27;t work for me as-is in any weather; I have to put a small amount of eye cream or Lubiderm on my lids to be able to spread it.  Second, it leaves little bits of black (or whatever color you are using) around and under your eye even with the greasy base.  Third, it does not last all day or even half a day; you might want to carry it with you and re-apply if you decide to make this your shadow.  Fourth, it does crease as another reviewer said--not, in my experience, worse than most cream shadows but still...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t want to have to prep for powdered shadow (which requires, on me, a base and powder and being really careful, etc). Do not apply with a brush; I agree you&#x27;ll get way too much. I dab it on and use a finger to spread where I want it. The good news is that if you put on too much you can simply wipe the excess off (unlike, in my experience, most powder shadows).  And you really should because it creases much worse when put on thickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I&#x27;ve had no trouble sharpening it with a big sharpener I bought at Se***ora.</li>
    <li> soft and glides on so nicely , came sealed which is a good thing i love it , and will repurchase it again for sure</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily use this as an eyeliner. I dab the white under my brow and in my tear duct, and it makes a great highlight. The package arrived within a few days and nothing was damaged or broken. It was winter, so the product did freeze a bit, but it softened down to the right consistency once it was inside. It came with my receipt and it was safely packaged in bubble rap. Great delivery, got here on time, and a great product.</li>
    <li> I think I got a bad patch</li>
    <li> I use this as a eye shadow primer and in my tear dot it&#x27;s amazing 💖</li>
    <li> It works great, I&#x27;ve had one before so I knew what to expect. If you are looking for something to enhance the color of your makeup and help it stick, this is right for you.</li>
    <li> First of all, these sharpen easily in a jumbo after freezing for 20 min. PIA so I took off a star BUT,  Tgey are worth it. Love the iced mocha color! My solution to a hooded eye is to use these in place of shadow, in a thick line above my gel liner. No fall out is also a positive for someone who conceals dark circles last, cuts down on overall time.</li>
    <li> I love this pencil.  I put it on my lids under my eyeshadow to make the colors pop.  Goes on super easy and is easy to blend and adds nice highlights to the eyes.</li>
    <li> pretty good but doesn&#x27;t hold as well as some have stated. All cheap products fail in some way or another BUT it still does the job!</li>
    <li> Love this as a lid primer, BUT I HATE the fact that you can&#x27;t even sharpen it??! Like what am I doing wrong. NYX couldn&#x27;t possibly have made an entire stick of product, when you can only use the tip…and ur already out. A tip though?? I was out within 9 applications of makeup. PLEASE tell me there a secret mechanism on this pencil that rolls the rest of the product up. lol</li>
    <li> this arrived days before expected. It is really white and creamy. It&#x27;ll brighten up any eyeshadow when applied as a base. You can use it as a base or an eyeshadow. It&#x27;ll turn any shimmery or glittery eyeshadow into a matte eyeshadow if enough is applied</li>
    <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.</li>
    <li> Nyx cosmetics are one of the best cosmetic lines out there!!! this jumbo pencil is so pigmented and so creamy I just love it:) the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that its not retractable, Eyeslipsface.com (ELF COSMETICS A.K.A another great cosmetic line) has a similar product but they retract but there&#x27;s are shimmer, at least mine all are and I like matte sometimes. Other that that great product, great buy!!!</li>
    <li> This pencil is so creamy and pigmented and goes on so smoothly. I seriously am in love with this pencil!</li>
    <li> i got this in less than a week! and it&#x27;s a wonderful pencil! i used it that very same day!</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it for everything I think everyone should have this in there make up bag at all times !!</li>
    <li> Love this as an eye shadow base and in the inner corner underneath a shimmery color. Makes me look so awake even when I&#x27;m not ;) I heard so many great reviews about it and was so happy to find it was just as great as everyone says. I haven&#x27;t sharpened it yet so I&#x27;m not sure how that&#x27;ll go since its plastic instead of wood but I don&#x27;t anticipate any problems. I would definitely recommend this product and when it runs out I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
    <li> i love love love i have try almost every single primer out there from  urban decay to mac this works is easy to apply not messy at all it stays on all day long</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I put it in the inner corners of my eyes and my blue eyes pop!  I&#x27;ve been wanting to make this purchase for awhile and I was not disappointed.  It&#x27;s smooth and easy to apply.  I have heard it can be hard to sharpen but I have not had to do that as I just received it and a little goes along way.  The product itself definitely deserves a 5 star rating but the seller I would only give 2.5 stars.  The item was shipped quickly and I received it within 4 days, however the description of this product claimed that it was sealed.  When it arrived at my house it was in a nice bubble wrapped shipping envelope, however the product was not sealed around the cap like it stated and like it should be.  I was hesitant to use it around my eyes because it wasn&#x27;t sealed, but it had no marks of use on the tip of the pencil.  That little issue aside, I highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> Looks great on and last all day.</li>
    <li> For the price it&#x27;s worth it! When I apply my eye shadow it&#x27;s  always gone in a few hours. I&#x27;m sure if I used quality eye shadow my after picture would have been better but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this again.  It was slightly came off but I&#x27;m blaming the cheap eye shadow.</li>
    <li> This eye pencil is DEFINITELY white! Don&#x27;t worry about it not having enough color, because&lt;br /&gt;it is very bright and VERY white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the NYX jumbo eye pencils now, and I bought three more after this one. It lasts a long&lt;br /&gt;time and it&#x27;s good quality. I would recommend buying this one online instead of locally, because the store&lt;br /&gt;ones tend to cost more. This one is a good size, a good price, and a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY negative about this is that it is REALLY WHITE. I put it on my waterline the first day&lt;br /&gt;and it made me look like a raccoon, it was so bright white. Now, I just blend it into my eye shadow&lt;br /&gt;a little bit, and some of that brightness fades into a really nice look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> Well ok so really theres good and bad. The good is it works really good i love it for that reason its great in that matter blah blah blah. But bad well first of all Theres no way to sharpen it. 2nd of all it creeses on greesy eyes ( good thing i dont have that trait) and last for 5 bucks you get very little abount of product so theres good and theres bad</li>
    <li> People raved about this product, so I bought it. Now I don&#x27;t know why. Can the pencil seriously not be sharpened and the pencil can&#x27;t be pushed up? You use the tip, and then it&#x27;s done? Useless.</li>
    <li> The jumbo pencil is great, just as expected from all the rave reviews. Works great as an eyelid primer and to bring out the pigment in your shadows-- makes them pop!</li>
    <li> Put a little of this on your waterline and inter-corner and your eyes pop! This product is pigmented and very creamy, so it does not tug on you skin. I get tons of compliments on my eye makeup now and I definitely use this everyday now.</li>
    <li> Great, good base, easy to blend.</li>
    <li> I used as a base for my eye shadow to make it pop. Love this pencil. It arrived quickly and was packaged good to keep it from breaking in transit.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite makeup item, I use it on my waterline, cupid&#x27;s bow and sometimes even to highlight my brow bone and cheeks. This is and essential item to own, don&#x27;t bother trying to buy any other white eye pencil from anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Very soft, but sticks to my eyelashes and makes everything white.</li>
    <li> The lid breaks easily, but the pencil is creamy and richly pigmented.</li>
    <li> I use this to highlight and contour my eyes and this is my favorite of the NYX line!</li>
    <li> Well, if you watch just about any YouTube tutorial on a make up look and they use the color white, there is a 10/12 chance that you will see them using a NYX Jumbo Milk pencil. When I went to purchase, or actually I was looking up the pencil, they were all sold out so obviously I ended up looking for it on Amazon. If it&#x27;s sold out and that many videos and professional, or some what professional make up artists use it, I thought it would be well worth a try. So I purchased it, it&#x27;s on its way and I&#x27;m VERY excited about it, I will let you know what I think about the product. Just for reference, I&#x27;m West Indian, of Indian descendants, I&#x27;m a darker medium shade, about Nw43 and NOTHING shows up on my skin, :\. I&#x27;m anticipating a few primers as well, and hopefully this pencil doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I have a white liner but it doesn&#x27;t work at all :\</li>
    <li> I bought this in the color Milk specifically for my waterline (make me look more awake at work lol) and it works wonderfully for that! It&#x27;s super creamy and reallllllly well pigmented, meaning it&#x27;s very easy to go too heavy with it (found that out the first time I used it), also if put on after other eyeliner (on the lash line I mean), the other eyeliner will likely rub off on the pencil and make colored marks on it.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped fast and in good condition, bubble wrapped so I&#x27;m happy with that.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it five stars because it does exactly what I got it for and it&#x27;s also really good quality (wouldn&#x27;t expect less from NYX), it never tugs on my eyes and it&#x27;s so pigmented that just one swipe on my waterline lasts for a couple hours (better than most considering where it is). I also really love how creamy it is, I imagine if it were to be used as a base, you wouldn&#x27;t have to use much, or you&#x27;d run the risk of creasing. But since you wouldn&#x27;t use as much product at once, it will probably last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this NYX Jumbo pencil in Milk. It&#x27;s a 2nd eyeshadow base, in case you put on pigmented eyeshadows onto your eyelids. This jumbo eye pencil doesn&#x27;t crease a lot at all. It&#x27;s my favorite white eyeshadow base. I have seen it on the makeup tutorial videos on You Tube also.</li>
    <li> the product was delivered long before the date given and I was actually surprised to see it in my mailbox (I live in Europe). Regarding the product, I am very satisfied with the texture of the pencil. I would definitely suggest it since a white pencil is a &amp;#34;must&amp;#34;  and you cannot go wrong with it.</li>
    <li> Read about this eye pencil on a blog and took a chance ordering it!  Love, Love, Love it... but save more for me!</li>
    <li> Love this eye pencil for highlighting &amp; freshening eyes after a hard day at work. Refreshes the eyes while adding the illusion of being bright eyed...Like you just woke up</li>
    <li> Best white eyeliner I have ever used... I use it on my water line, and it makes my eyes look brighter, and bigger! I get so many compliments.. will buy again.</li>
    <li> I use this under my light and/or less expensive eye shadows to provide more pigmentation and it works great! Super creamy texture that I can blend with a fingertip. I have used this 10+ times and it does not clump or crease. Thank you</li>
    <li> I used this as an eyeshadow primer. I saw a girl do it on youtube. I love it! It makes the color pop &amp; my eyes look great. I will purchase this again in the future.</li>
    <li> Everybody raves about these so I figured I would try one. It didn&#x27;t work for the look I wanted since it smears easy but I could use it for so many other looks! IT really makes eye shadow bright! I set 604 Milk with a white eye shadow  and it didn&#x27;t crease and looked amazing all day long! I will defiantly be buying more of these and repurchasing Milk!</li>
    <li> I received my package within three days, the jumbo pencil works well except it creases without a base. I will purchase more in the future.</li>
    <li> I have many NYX shadow pencils and this one (Milk) and the black one, don&#x27;t crease and work wonderfully as eyeshadow bases or eyeshadow colors. The other NYX shadow pencils have to be on top of a primer for any chance of longevity.  If blended out it doesn&#x27;t remain completely opaque but has strong pigmentation.</li>
    <li> Since it is Jumbo, is really easy to draw dramatic look with it, easy to apply, I can wear it half a day depends how oily my skin is that day.</li>
    <li> Put it on under eyeshadow to make it pop.  Great product, eyeshadows are still blendable on top of it.</li>
    <li> An absolute must for your makeup kit. Easy to apply and gives you a fantastic, creamy line or smudge.  It sets the perfect base for your bright/highly pigmented eye shadows.  I&#x27;ve even smeared this on my lips to give a true pop and some holding powder for bright lip colors.</li>
    <li> This Nyx Jumbo Pencil is a really good base especially for bright colors. It makes it pop. I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my handds on this jumbo eye pencil for the longest and i finally got it. . I also have the Green and Purple Jumbo Eye Pencil. i love it, and yes i would recommend it to someone else. .</li>
    <li> I have bought this product many times and I will continue to buy this product from this seller! I have never been unhappy with this product, the seal is never broken and it&#x27;s of very good quality! I always use this as an eye shadow base! Never creases and it always stays on all day!</li>
    <li> Perfect as a base for eyeshadows, it maks the pigments intensify to give you a professional look. I love this liner!</li>
    <li> What can I say? NYX jumbo pencil is milk is a pretty statement essential products among many makeup gurus. It&#x27;s great as a base to make any eyeshadow colors pop, and its an overall great pure white makeup product. The price is even better! There are so many other colors from this line, but this is just a great staple piece for any makeup lovers.</li>
    <li> I loved is product when I got it I love how it just glides on to your eye.As a crease shadow or eye shadow primer it is amazing either way.the only thing that I hated happened. the lid  would crack very easily and the product would hit the top of the lid/cap.which was very irritating.But other then that I love it.All of my friends love when I wear it!</li>
    <li> Prefect and was shipped fast</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as lid primer and it worked great. It made the shadow stay all day with no creasing and also helped the color pop :) much better than those expensive lid primers</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is pretty darn good. I bought it in the white (I believe it&#x27;s called milk) and I like it a lot. I have it 4 stars because sometimes it goes on a little clumpy, but it&#x27;s easily fixed after application. You can really do a lot with this stuff and it makes your eyes look wider, more awake. I would definitely recommend it. Easy, smooth application. It was shipped and delivered quickly and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this! It makes my colors show up SO GOOD. It&#x27;s very waxy, so blending can take longer than usual but your makeup will stand out more and last a little longer. I wouldn&#x27;t use this as a main primer though, as it does start to crease about after 5 hours. I would use an eye primer, then this eye pencil, then your shadow. As far as sharpening goes? I suggest not to. I would definitely look up some depotting tutorials on youtube. Sharpening can cause you lose a lot of product so that&#x27;s my suggestion.</li>
    <li> Lovely white eyeliner. Goes on really well and last very long! Can be used as an eyeliner or as a base for eyeshadow! Definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This was a great item and I love using it. Love to use it all over my eyes before I apply my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> I read reviews that this Milk Liner makes your eyes look bigger, etc.  It may do that but when you put it on, it clumps up.  You have to use your finger to even it out.  Wasn&#x27;t worth buying.</li>
    <li> This liner was bought as an eyeshadow primer. Unfortunately it was too creamy for that. It creased and smudged- very oily. the eyeshadow would not brush on properly either.. But I guess if you want your eyelids to have not so neat white grease on it, is does the job!</li>
    <li> This is a good white pencil.</li>
    <li> Love this and it came in really fast😍 the milk one makes your eyes look bigger and makes the eyes look amazing. I use it on my bottom part of my eye like you would but normal eyeliner.its amazingg😍😍</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT AND I USE IT AS A BASE TO MY EYESHADOW AND IT MAKES MY COLORS POP! WHEN I WANT A DIFFERENT LOOK WITH BRIGHT COLORS I ALWAYS REACH FOR THIS PENCIL.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this brand out after reading great reviews. Good price for the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of small liners, but dont have larger ones such as this. It does require me to purchase a larger sharpener. Its good for decently thick lining or cornering of the eyes. I love the simple look and feel of the stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice tho if I try to draw corners to make my eyes pop with this, my black liner would get on to this pencil, but this is white, so I guess its expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend for people who are looking for a chubbier eyeliner stick. The white really comes out and is true to its color.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT and cheap alternative to eyeshadow primer. Put it on and blend it before applying eyeshadow and you&#x27;ll find that it sticks all day. My makeup-artist friend told me about this little secret and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. I used to use Urban Decay primer potion and still do from time to time, but this is a great product to use to use as well!</li>
    <li> Exactly what i expected :) looked amazing in the tear drops of my eyes</li>
    <li> I liked the shade, but for the size, I expected more.  Being a &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34;, I expected to get a pencil I should sharpen or twist, instead I got an oversized stick that is useless once you&#x27;ve used the tip.  I was using it for a day of the dead make up job, and though I liked that it didn&#x27;t crust over, it was just disappointing to realize what you see with the blind eye, is what you get.</li>
    <li> I USE this under my eyeshadow and i must say i absolutely love it. The only thing is i dont know how to sharpen it but i just use the bottom of my eyeshadow brush and puck some out now and again dwl. and THERES A TON LOAD OF PRODUCT IN IT</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read many reviews about this and finally bought it. I love it! It really makes shadows pop. I also use it as an eye primer and it works great!</li>
    <li> I applied this above my lower lashes to &amp;#34;open&amp;#34; my eyes all day.  Lasted all day and applies smoothly.  A must have for perking up tired eyes!</li>
    <li> I have read and seen so many reviews and videos on this product and on the white color. It looked perfect and it is, but not for me. Good price and product quantity, it is creamy, but unfortunately for me the main point is that is not a color for me, almost all tutorials have people who have very white skin color, so it looks very natural how the applied product look on them, or with the blending colors of eyeshadows. But on me, looks like, hmmm, very weird. My skin color is white but a little yellow, I really believe is for drinking many years ago so much Coca Cola. I wish NYX get a light creamy color like the nude eyeshadow code. This could work for my skintone.</li>
    <li> I like how this pencil makes my shadows more vivid... It applies smoothly and evenly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the packaging. I have yet to sharpen it but I&#x27;m dreading doing so. I wish it was a screw up or push up product.</li>
    <li> I use ths product as a base after applying my eyeshadow primer. It makes my eyeshadow colours brighter and mor epigmented. I love it. My only problem is how to sharpen it. since it is not wood. And there&#x27;s no adjustment to bring out more of the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a white eye pencil for the longest time without having to break the bank. Saw this pencil on a youtube tutorial and then looked it up on Amazon to find that it was less than $10. Seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for a white eye pencil to line your lower rim, look no further! The consistency and application is smooth and it lasts all day! The jumbo size allows me to also use it as a highlighter right under my brows and as a shadow over my lid.</li>
    <li> This works great as an eye shadow, eye liner, and a primer for bright colors. I have some eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t have the best pigmentation- and when I put it on over top of this it was wonderful! I will buy this again!</li>
    <li> does what it says, works, however it didn&#x27;t come factory sealed which worried me until I realized most makeups on here are not due to the fact that they don&#x27;t sit on store shelves amonst the masses.</li>
    <li> If you use any bright eyeshadow it&#x27;s a perfect base. I suggest to you a primer then the milk eyeliner and the shadow. I use it with all my sugarpill eyeshadows. Works wonderful with all my loose and pressed powder.</li>
    <li> As most of you know, NYX milk is a staple of most makeup bags, and I agree- it&#x27;s definitely a permanent part of mine.  I use it as an eyeshadow primer, and sometimes I use it as a matte highlight.  It actually works really well- it blends so nicely that it looks really natural, especially on my ghostly white skin.  I also use it on my waterline to brighten up my eyes and help me look more awake.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional make-up artist and could not live without this pencil!! It is so creamy and wonderful! It is the perfect pencil for highlighting the inner corners of the eyes, under the brows and even in the water line for an instant big eye effect! This seller is amazing, I purchase from her often! You can&#x27;t beat $5!!</li>
    <li> I love the creamy consistency of this product. It goes on smooth and makes my shadows pop! I love it a lot. Will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this , it has many uses and works great for water line inner and outer corners , I will try and purchase a color other then white and try it next .</li>
    <li> Works very nicely for using on your bottom waterline to make your eyes appear bigger and brighter! Stays on for a decent amount of time as well.</li>
    <li> This thing maybe the best purchase I have ever made. I use it as an over all highlighter, and on my waterline. This is perfect for me because I am nearly albino in color, and most highlighters are too dark for my skin. But this is whiter than white! It&#x27;s super creamy and it stays put. I like to layer my eye shadow over it for an extra pop. If you are on the fence, BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> My MAC shade is NC35 and i find this an excellent eye shadow base to make my eye shadow appear brighter</li>
    <li> Best white eyeliner yet!</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing product in the world! It makes crappy 1$ eyeshadows look good!&lt;br /&gt;I have oily eyelids, so less is more. It really goes a long way!</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago and I still use it! the only probelms were that it was hard finding a sharpener for it and after a while the crease of the eyes starts spliting the makeup.</li>
    <li> i really liked this pencil. It is very creamy based and i was very amazed at how my shadows did not crease. it really does help you colors stand out... my only downfall would be that u have to purchase a sharpener for it since it dosent fit in a normal one but other than that its great</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and will definitely repurchase. Item arrived as expected and as described. Thank you!! NYX jumbo eye pencils are the BEST!!</li>
    <li> This review is for NYX&#x27;s Jumbo Eye Pencil in Milk.  I mainly bought this as a base for my eyeshadow.  I also own some MAC Paint Pots so this will be a comparison to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIZE/CONSISTENCY&lt;br /&gt;The size of this pencil is pretty big (well, obviously?), so if you want to create small, precise lines with this pencil, I would recommend using a small brush.  Otherwise, you can spread this all over your lid--you don&#x27;t need much, it&#x27;s very concentrated--and then apply eyeshadow over it.  It has a somewhat sticky, semi-opaque consistency, so it&#x27;s not as easy to blend eyeshadow on top of it, but it will make your eyeshadow colors more vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LASTABILITY&lt;br /&gt;I found that when I used this as a base, it lasted about 4-5 before my eyeshadow colors faded.  That&#x27;s okay, but not great.  When applied to my waterline, it lasted for about a minute.  It&#x27;s not waterproof; if you have watery eyes, this simply isn&#x27;t usable on your waterline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COMPARISON TO MAC PAINT POT&lt;br /&gt;When compared to MAC Paint Pot, this is absolutely NOT a dupe.  It doesn&#x27;t even come close.  MAC Paint Pots are very opaque and have a dry finish, so it&#x27;s easier to blend eyeshadow; NYX Jumbo Pencils are a bit sticky.  Also, unlike Paint Pots, this DOES crease, usually within a few hours for me.  To combat it, I put on Urban Decay primer potion before applying this (a primer on top of a primer? what? :P) and it helped.  Paint Pots also seemed to retain eyeshadow better, so Paint Pots are my preferred choice here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you just need something cheap as a primer for eyeshadow, this will do the job, but it&#x27;s not that great.  I&#x27;d recommend saving your money for a MAC Paint Pot instead.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, it just makes all eyeshadows brighter.  I plan on purchasing this product again.  This product is a must have, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product it is everything i had expected and more! Becoming a re-buy very soon!</li>
    <li> I got this in milk, and I was spectacle about it I really had no clue how big it was gonna be and how it would work, but it turned out to be great! I don&#x27;t use it as an eyeshadow or a eyeliner I use it in the inner corners of my eyes it looks really good and makes your eyes pop! I also put my white glitter eyeshadow over it to make it even nicer! Definitely will be buying more! Also, shipping was 3 days early!</li>
    <li> The diversity of this eye pencil lives up to what everyone has to say about it. Goes on smooth, easy to pat and blend.</li>
    <li> This pencil is a great asset to your makeup kit.  In addition to using it by itself, it makes a great base for layering on other colors over it.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the NYX white eyeshadow base, and I wouldn&#x27;t use either of these without a good eyeshadow primer first, but if you just need a subtle &amp;#34;whitewash&amp;#34; to help boost your color payoff, this pencil will give you that and can be used for other applications as well instead of relying on a specialty use product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is creamy and applies well, and like the other NYX pencils I&#x27;ve found that it blends like a dream!  If you are only going to buy one NYX jumbo pencil, this is the one!</li>
    <li> I use it as an eye shadow base, but it could also be used as a matte highlight for the brow bone. Has a nice creamy texture, which is easier to use than the NYX potted eye shadow base.</li>
    <li> I love makeup and I use this product on a daily basis to get my eyeshadow to perfection.  I have it in the color milk.  I use it to brighten up eyeshadow kind of like a base.  It is very creamy therefore you gotta hold it down with eyeshadow.  It&#x27;s not an eyeliner its a creamy color that helps your eyeshadow look brighter and creates eaze of blending.  It&#x27;s an essential to me and you can sharpen it!  Ive had mine for almost a year now and I&#x27;m not even half way with it yet! Highly recomend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great pigmented color and it can be used for alot of uses&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a highlight under my brow and also sometimes as a eye sticky base</li>
    <li> I bought this because Ive seen ppl use it all the time on youtube so I wanted one. Its works well on eyes or lips. Everybody should have one</li>
    <li> I bought two of this ... My mom loved it so I gave her one and it was so good that I bought the entire collection of these nyx eyeshadow pencils</li>
    <li> I heard a lot about this one thing&lt;br /&gt;I was so exicted to try it!&lt;br /&gt;But when I tried it it was good sometimes and some time goes gray :)</li>
    <li> This liner glides on smooth and blends well. Very versatile, I use as a shadow, liner, or to highlight certain areas of the face. Also gives a more awake look when used on the water line of the inner eye.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I bought it because of all the hype I hear on youtube and other sites about how great eyeshadows show when this shadow liner is used as a base. I used it just the other day for an event, and they were right. I see every color as bright as it shows in the palette. I am very happy with my order :)</li>
    <li> We needed something that would lighten up the top part of the lid for an appearance on stage and this did the trick.</li>
    <li> Nice and good quality.</li>
    <li> My sister bought this and recommended I get it. I finally did and am so happy with it! It goes on so much better than any other brand I have used!</li>
    <li> This came pretty quick and I love it.its just a great NYX product to have. Glad I found it on here!</li>
    <li> When I purchased the NYX Jumbo pencil in Milk, I had heard nothing but good things about this product. And its true this pencil is a perfect eyeshadow base/eyeliner, I am not a professional makeup artist or an expert. But from my experience this pencil is great with red and blue colors and really help make the colors pop!!!</li>
    <li> Its so versatile, it can be used as a base, a shadow, or a liner and more I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve used it for so far. It works really well, very pigmented, nice product. I did have a bit of creasing with it after a few hours, but if you use a primer it should be good.</li>
    <li> What I can say?!?! It is a white base that helps with those colors to be more vibrant. On ALL skin tones!!! There was no damage done. I ordered this pencil because it is better than the color tattoo bases IN MY OPINON.</li>
    <li> This is a great addition to anyone&#x27;s makeup repertoire.  Love the various available colors and it applies easily and smoothly.</li>
    <li> I have very very bad skin, everything makes me break out. This however doesn&#x27;t, and seems to work well. don&#x27;t have to apply it a lot. so its perfect. no smell, lasts long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not to happy with it I payed 5 dollars for sumthing that has so little product ...half of my pinky is bigger than the product. :(</li>
    <li> Love nyx company they deliver products on time, lovely primer for more pop to light colored eyeshadow absolutely loved it</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of these eyeliners. They are great colors, creamy consistency, apply easily, last all day, and don&#x27;t smudge. I like using the color Milk as a base for my eyeshadow, and to highlight the inner corners of my eyes and my waterline. I&#x27;m very happy with this pencil, and since it&#x27;s such a lot of product, it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This was the only white liner, so far, that stayed all through the day for me. By dinner time it was looking like it was starting to blend with it&#x27;s surrounding makeup. In my quest for awesome, lasting, bright white liner, this is at the top of my favorites list.</li>
    <li> I love NYX. I own about 5 of these pencils &amp; the lips ones. They&#x27;re so great! They glide on smoothly &amp; the colors are vibrant &amp; just pop!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of my favourites things I ever purchased for make up. I use it A LOT!! I would buy it again, and I always recommend to my friends!</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing countless recommendations for it on Sugarpill cosmetics&#x27; reviews. I was extremely pleased with the product, its easy to use, sharpen and works for everything. It makes all my eyeshadows pop, and since I&#x27;m more on the tan side, it helps those really light colored shadows show up on my skin! I&#x27;ve gotten lazy and stopped using a primer and just substitute this and it works great for that too! Definitely purchasing my refills through this buyer when the time comes!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smooth creamy blends well! I&#x27;ve used a few other bases and this makes all my looks especially neutral ones pop! I&#x27;m a caramel tone a.a female and this even stands up to this crazy vegas heat so thumbs up I&#x27;m gonna just invest in the whole set and have some fun. Ps works awesome with the 28neutral palette too fyi:)</li>
    <li> I love multi-use products so much! This is awesome for an eyeliner, a highlighter, or if you want to spice up your brows, it&#x27;s great for brightening those too! Fantastic consistency!</li>
    <li> The white ( Milk ) goes on smooth and stays on several hours before needing a touch up. I would recommend this eye liner  .</li>
    <li> Goes on so smoothly and effortlessly. I thought I could use this on my waterline but it seems too bright. Its fine though. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is amazing I love the color and its so creamy!! :) Going to buy more colors!!! :)</li>
    <li> Love this product and shipped fast</li>
    <li> I love it! Its very pigmented. I use it as eyeliner, it makes my eyes look bigger. Great buy!  :)</li>
    <li> used for halloween costume and it was creamy and very pigmented. long lasting and worth it. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> However, it does get kinda creamy when you use it that way. Once you put the powder over it and try to blend, it kinda makes your eyelid look old and wrinkly lol It goes away after a bit and returns to a normal, youthful eyelid so no biggy. It is a tad difficult to blend it without smearing it everywhere but that not a dealbreaker</li>
    <li> Really good color, its a little chunky but if you apply it very lightly it will be fine.</li>
    <li> This is my second purchase of this fantastic product!  I love the way it goes on and how it stays in place...no crease line!  I have several colors and they are all great!  Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> I like to use this product as a primer for my more sheer eye shadows. It does a great job of showing more pigment as well as keeping my shadow on longer. No more faded shadow at the end of the day. I can&#x27;t believe how much of a different this little pen has made for me!</li>
    <li> I like the color but it is very hard to put on. I tried using a brush and I tried using my fingers to rub it in, but neither were a very good method of applying the product to my eyelids. I got it mainly to use as a base for eye shadow, and it works pretty good at making my eye shadow last longer and appear more pigmented. However it works better for me as a highlighter for the inner corners of my eyes. If you just apply some directly from the pencil tip to the inner corners of your eyes and then blend/smudge it a little with your fingers it really makes our eyes pop!! I love using it for that!! Also, as a warning, the pencil is very difficult to sharpen and breaks easily. A jumbo pencil sharpener is also required. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to sharpen it with a knife because the outside casing for the pencil is very hard and plastic like. Overall this pencil is pretty great, but I don&#x27;t think it is worth all the hype that some beauty blogs and reviews make it out to be.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I recommend highly.</li>
    <li> Came before it said deliver so I&#x27;m glad and the product my favorite for lots of use!!!</li>
    <li> I use this pencil as a base for when I put my eye shadow on. It actually work better than my eye insurance , so that&#x27;s  saying something about this product. the only thing I don&#x27;t like  is that I cannot sharpen my pencil. It has a hard plastic covering. If someone out there knows how to sharpen a nyx pencil please let me know.</li>
    <li> This goes on so smooth and very vibrant!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a stylist who is still learning more and more about makeup (you have to be diverse in thus industry). A friend suggested this pencil to me and I am so glad that she did! I really does make colors POP! I would recommend this item to anyone who loves makeup or loves makeup artistry...</li>
    <li> I bought NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in \\&quot;Milk\\&quot; &amp; it&#x27;s amazingg! It&#x27;s def everything I expected. It&#x27;s super vibrant &amp; it goes on so smooth. I love it!</li>
    <li> Not only does it help the eyeshadow adhere to the eyelids, which makes the look all the more lasting, but it also makes the colors POP! :) overall, it is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> when I got this the butt end was broken off. The color is fabulous though. I dont know if I want to go ahead and pot melt this into a jar or send it back. either way I didnt know the sheeth was plastic and while they can be sharpened thats not the most fun task. I will probably melt it because to mail it back sounds like a hassel.</li>
    <li> i saw people recommend this on youtube and bought it. It&#x27;s okay to highlight your eyes liner corner, but you should apply eyeshadow over it since it&#x27;s white and unnatural to put alone.</li>
    <li> I got the nyx jumbo eye pencil in milk. The pencil arrived right on schedule. It is a great product, especially if it is used as a base for the rest of your eyeshadow. I use it everyday to make my eyeshadow pop. However, nyx jumbo eye pencils are known to crease, mine certainly does, but I don&#x27;t really notice it and when I do I don&#x27;t mind at all because it works so well! If you have an Ulta or Target near you they sell these for the same price or cheaper, but if you do not have either of those located near you I would buy this item from here! Because I use mine so much I will have to sharpen it soon and will have to buy a large pencil sharpener (These have been recommended as very good pencil sharpeners: UD Grindhouse Double Barrel Sharpener and NARS Pencil Sharpener). They do get dull quickly and they are not very precise, so they can&#x27;t be used as an eyeliner. They blend out nicely and don&#x27;t feel very heavy. All in all a great product worth the money.</li>
    <li> Love love love this product! Keeps all my shadows looking more vibrant</li>
    <li> This pencil feels milky and it is very pigmented. Very good to use for a eyeshadow base</li>
    <li> Goes on great, super clean and pigmented white color. I use this on my lower waterline to brighten and really open up my eyes. Even if I&#x27;m super tiered in the morning NYX&#x27;s Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner in Milk makes me look bright eyed and bushy tailed. It doesn&#x27;t pull at your skin when your applying at all, like some cheap waxy liners.This glides right on like butter! They should be called butter sticks! It doesn&#x27;t transfer onto my top waterline or lashes after I apply it, so no touching up necessary. It is everything I wanted in a white eye pencil! Also, makes a great base for eye shadows, making colors brighter and making them stay put longer. So happy I purchased and will again! It&#x27;s an all around great buy, with so many uses in one great jumbo pencil! NYX&#x27;s Jumbo Eye Pencil Shadow Liner in Milk is going on my favorites list and now has a permanent spot in my eye pencil organizer!</li>
    <li> I love using this as an eyeprimer....the color from the shadow realky shows love this pencil....just wish it would come with a sharpner.</li>
    <li> LOVE AS A BASE FOR MY EYESHADOW!!!</li>
    <li> milk makes a wonderful base for showing the brightness of other colors.  also works great as a highlight on brow bones and inner corners</li>
    <li> Great finish, love this line!</li>
    <li> this is a great white liner. it shows up the most of any white eyeliner I have ever had and it has lots of uses from using it as an eyeliner to a primer. I think its a must have for any makeup kit.</li>
    <li> love putting MILK all over my eyes! great to line under eyebrows or lids to make shadows really pop and holds in the color as well! or ill just put it mainly on the inner corners of my eyes and roll on glitter to really snap crackle and pop and sizzle those sultry eyes! also great coverage! i put under my eyes to conceal dark circles as well and any other blemishes dark spots prior to putting foundation and powder! i just dont look as great without my secret weapon when putting on my war paint! love is a battlefield you best be prepared gf!</li>
    <li> am glad i purchased this! wish i would have done it sooner. item came very quickly! thank you! will do business again! great to make the eyeshadow color pop</li>
    <li> I use this as a primer under lighter colors and bold colors that I want to stay vivid. Haven&#x27;t had any troubles with it creasing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pencil for about a week now.  There isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about it!  A few people have said it&#x27;s a little chalky, but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case.  It does seem to run a little smoother if I wipe it on my hand a few times first.</li>
    <li> i dont even know what i can say to explain how much i love this product. i just know that any girl or guy that does makeup needs this. so dont think about it just put this in your cart and buy it......stop reading this review and buy it already!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is great to define the brow bone and to apply on the lid as a base for neon eye shadow or to just get brighter colors brighter.</li>
    <li> ╰☆╮I was going to purchase the NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil in COTTAGE CHEESE, but I decided to get it in MILK; biggest regret. I wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased this product, I mean it&#x27;s really good for using as a base for your eyeshadow, but for me I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I see my favorite beauty guru, xSparkage on youtube, use this eyeliner constantly and I can understand why! I recently got the set of 27 or so on here for Christmas and each eyeliner is very pigmented, especially this! The color is seriously the whitest I&#x27;ve ever seen and enhances your eyes for every eye color. Love love love and will definitely be re-purchasing this one!</li>
    <li> Great - but wastes a lot of product when sharpening, so I recommend depotting it.  You can find tutorials for that on youtube, not hard to do.</li>
    <li> ObviouslyI am too old to be using this or it might help if it weren&#x27;t so wide.  Nevertheless I don&#x27;t ever get it on right so I rarely use it.</li>
    <li> Love my NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil! I love how it helps open up my eyes when applies to my lower eyelid</li>
    <li> Great jumbo stick! I use this for my fawn makeup and its fantastic. I love this makeup stick.</li>
    <li> I have just received my product &amp; I am so in love with this jumbo eye pencil, wish there was a way you could sharpen it, but I needed this for my trip to Cali soon so I am very happy! LOVE NYX PRODUCTS. Will be ordering this again when it does run out, Thank you! :)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like that it isnt a twist up. I thought that was absurd because It should be. None of this sharpen the plastic nonsense.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on youtube in tons of eyeshadow diy videos and they were soooo right! Your eyeshadow colours (yes, i used a &#x27;u&#x27; in &#x27;colour&#x27; I&#x27;m english trained!) totally pop! It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> I use this to set my eye shadow but as a eyeliner it is not as nice in application or appearance.</li>
    <li> okay so first of all the shipping was super quick which is always amazing. But most of all this eyeliner can be used for so many other things! you can use it as a base, eyeliner, highlight, and much more its just simply amazing.! 5 STARS.!&amp;lt;333</li>
    <li> Great base for a color that needs brightening up. I blend it out with my finger and it works great. It sets pretty quickly so work quick or it&#x27;ll flake off and look weird.</li>
    <li> I thought the color was &#x27;milk&#x27;, but I find it so creamy that I think it goes on like milk.  It is super white and goes on easily.  It&#x27;s easy to blend with a brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything I expected it to be. I&#x27;m very happy and I totally recommend this for ppl who want to get the most out of their eye shadows.</li>
    <li> I bought the jumbo pencil after reading a lot of excellent reviews from many beauty bloggers and on Youtube. The only complaint?  hard to blend it out over the eyelid. I use my fingers because it is the best way. Once applied any eyeshadow color pops up like in an explosion.My eyeshadow stays all day long.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! it goes great with urban decay eyeshadow primer and it really does make my eyeshadow pop more. it didnt crease up for me so i am very pleased with this</li>
    <li> Have loved this milk pencil for years! They always make your eyeshadows an extra vibrant color. So worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love how it looks with all my shadows, I put it on the corners of my eyes and sometimes on my browbone for a nice highlight effect</li>
    <li> It was slightly smaller than I expected but definitely worth it! It&#x27;s so pigmented that honestly you need to use a q-tip or something to spread it around and make it more natural. I love it and would suggest someone to buy it.</li>
    <li> i love it makes my eyes pop, and my shadow stay on longer. I&#x27;m sure i will be buying it again.</li>
    <li> every girl should buy this pencil .. it&#x27;s gorgeous as a primer to make you eyeshadow pop !! I also I love to use it under my eyebrow after blending it as a highlighter ..</li>
    <li> Love my nyx eye pencil in milk. Awesome product and was so glad to get it on here as it&#x27;s always sold out in the stores. Very popular with so many people. Love all nyx products as they are own by MAC they are good but cost less. My kind of bargain for sure. Goes on smooth and beautiful color. Stays put all day and doesn&#x27;t need touchup.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy and doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
    <li> a you tuber that i follow uses this as a base to make colors pop. so i thought i&#x27;d try it glad i did. works great. makes lighter eyeshadows stand out more and makes brigher colors really pop</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try this pencil. It is fantastic! Creamy and easy to blend. It is not dehydrating to the eye and it allows&lt;br /&gt;vibrant color to really shine!</li>
    <li> Ive seen many you tube vids using nyx jumbo milk for a base. Its good but i prefer the nyx eyeshadow primer in white. The jumbo milk creases after a few hours, unlike the eyeshadow primer in white.</li>
    <li> Im starting to love all NYX eyeliners. They are easily applied and smooth going on.</li>
    <li> Works about as good as I was expecting.  Didn&#x27;t want to fork out the money for the Kat Von D concealer for the ink on my wrist and this dulls it just as well.  Just wish it would set as well as hers!</li>
    <li> This product is a great base for eyeshadow!  The color is pure white, so it definitely makes even cheap eyeshadow pop nicely.  The only bad thing about it is that it will stand out if you have areas that you have not added shadow, so be sure to cover only the areas you intend to use eyeshadow on.  I apply the pencil directly to the lid and then rub it in with my fingertips.  I plan on de-sticking this one so I don&#x27;t lose product when sharpening the pencil.</li>
    <li> .This is the best shadow prime i love it</li>
    <li> I reallyy love Nyx products after being introduced only alittle while ago because I was skeptical once I find something I like I stick with it. Its huge for the price which I love but I cant seem to keep it off my lashes Cus I use it as an eyeliner for bottom to brighten up my eyes so I may shape it to keep clumping on lashes they look gray after I put on my masscara other than that no complaints</li>
    <li> I love this pencil. I ordered mine in 604 Milk, and it is amazing. I use it in the corners of my eyes to highlight, and then i lightly roll it over my lids to act a a primer for eyeshadow. Makes your  eye shadow pop, and it lasts all day. Great product!</li>
    <li> This is awesome as a base for bright eyeshadows. Had to depot it to get the product out. Just search YouTube for a &amp;#34;jumbo pencil depot&amp;#34; tutorial.</li>
    <li> I will definitely buy one of these again, although probably not through Amazon.  My pencil arrived with no plastic seal even though it clearly says \\&quot;sealed\\&quot; in the product description.  The product itself is great and I&#x27;ve only used it as a base for eye shadows.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any creasing or running down the lids.  Definitely lives up to the hype IMO.</li>
    <li> I hate eye pencils in general- but this is the perfect formula, I might convert. I got the color &amp;#34;Milk&amp;#34; for waterlines and it is PERFECT! So happy to find something that actually works. Also, works great for highlighting corners of the eye, bridge of nose, and upper lip.</li>
    <li> It makes a great base, shadows look brighter with NYX Jumbo eye pencil in milk under them. I love it.</li>
    <li> Great pencil for the price</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Great as a base. Cream consistency so it&#x27;s very easy to blend. There are a lot of people saying that you can only get what&#x27;s on the tip. Not true. You can depot it by removing the bottom with a pair of pliers and putting the pencil in a small jar/pot. Then run over it with a hair dryer or put it in the microwave for a bit. There&#x27;s a lot of product in there and the payoff is beyond excellent. Will definitely repurchase. Arrived quickly and in great condition</li>
    <li> I use this on my inner rim. This was my first attempt and it didn&#x27;t hurt (yay!) This liner is soft and goes on easy- draw a line on your hand first to get it going. Set with white or clear powder.. or your face powder for a more natural look.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with white eyeliner. My husband got me this last year for my birthday and I still use it. I typically smudge a small amount in the corners of my eyes to brighten them up, but I also use it on my waterline as well. This really makes your eyes pop and look larger. The white has such a beautiful effect. I love to try out new things with make up so this is always a go to I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liner is smooth and creamy, blends well. Love it!</li>
