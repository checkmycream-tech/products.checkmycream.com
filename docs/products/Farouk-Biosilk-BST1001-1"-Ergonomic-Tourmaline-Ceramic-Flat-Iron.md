      <li>The flat iron is wonderful while its working.  </li>
      <li>I thought that it seemed pretty good, coming from Chi.</li>
      <li>I ordered and expected wonderful performance from Biosilk.</li>
      <li>It heated up quickly and only took one stroke to straighten my hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny! : )</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>When my straightener broke, I found this one online and got very excited to get the same great product.</li>
      <li>Its that in between hot and warm ...</li>
      <li>I love the biosilk hair products, and thought their flat iron would be great too.</li>
      <li>and I missed out on the sale at JCPenney when they had them super cheap and my friend&#x27;s niece was able to get it with her discount.</li>
      <li>Best part is, with my discount, it cost me LESS than my cheap Conair.  </li>
      <li>gets very hot!</li>
      <li>This one fit the bill and exceeded my expectations.</li>
      <li>Well, let me tell you, it blows my cheap Conair away.</li>
      <li>The on/off switch is cheaply made and should be redesigned.  </li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>Its made by the same company as CHI, and I think it works great.</li>
      <li>Definately a GREAT flat iron!</li>
      <li>the cord is nice and long which can come in handy if your outlet isnt close by.</li>
      <li>These are inexpensive but effective hair straighteners which we highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Very nice flat iron.</li>
      <li>The first lasted more than a year</li>
      <li>It gets hot quickly and does an incredible job straightening my hair, which is frizzy and coarse.</li>
      <li>Easy to use, fast heat up and cool down, and an excellent price</li>
      <li>It may be a good product for those with fine hair however if you have curly, wavy, or even ethnic hair, I would try another flat iron.</li>
      <li>The Farouk Flat Iron is AMAZING!</li>
      <li>You know when you put straightened hair in a pony tail and sometimes it just kind of sticks out like an anime character instead of falling naturally?</li>
      <li>With the Biosilk, I only ran it thru once, sometimes twice if I didn&#x27;t have a good pull on my hair.  </li>
      <li>I have very curly hair and have been straitening it for many years.  </li>
      <li>He told me that I&#x27;d be refunded IN FULL</li>
      <li>Ive been looking for an affordable yet really good flat iron.</li>
      <li>I love this straightener, for me it turned my normal 2 hours to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Very reliable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>But, I must admit,I can&#x27;t even remember when I first began to use it...years ago!</li>
      <li>I used to have to run the iron thru my hair 3, sometimes 4 times for it to be completely straight and smooth.  </li>
      <li>My old one latest 6 years before it went in my luggage on a plane and got wrecked from the luggage being tossed around.</li>
      <li>I love it so far</li>
      <li>Different temperature settings are nice too.</li>
      <li>I was torn between this and any CHI flat irons, as most are salon recommended/ ceramic and fabulous.</li>
      <li>Gets VERY hot and has a temperature dial, so you can choose how hot you want it to get.</li>
      <li>The first one, just recently,stopped working.</li>
      <li>I bought this iron back in &#x27;06 and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>I found it much more affordable than the CHI, but delivers the same quality.</li>
      <li>I love how sturdy and solid it is.</li>
      <li>But this iron makes my hair so stinking soft and my hair looks like it&#x27;s naturally smooth.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

    <li> This is the second biosilk straightener that I have owned.  The first lasted more than a year so I replaced it with the same model.  The replacement broke within a week.  The red straightening plates lifted and would not heat and the on/off switch stayed in the on position when plugged in even though it wasn&#x27;t heating.  Not sure if I got lucky with the first one I owned or got a lemon with the replacement.</li>
    <li> If you like CHI irons, you&#x27;ll be satisfied with this one. I found it much more affordable than the CHI, but delivers the same quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this item in a serious debate for myself -- I had previously been using cheapy, crappy, \\&quot;wet-to-straight\\&quot; METAL \\&quot;flat\\&quot; iron (and I use FLAT very loosely!) that was time to finally retire to the garbage.    I was torn between this and any CHI flat irons, as most are salon recommended/ ceramic and fabulous. I finally went with this particular item and have been using EVER since! It is light-weight, visually appealing and slightly funky, heats up quickly and cools down just the same. I am in LOVE with this straightener AND the price I paid for it! I am SOSO glad to see it still on the market and still racking up great reviews!</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron over a year ago and I have seen better. I have natural curly/wave thick hair that I periodically get relaxed and I use this straightener in between my salon trips.    It heats up pretty fast &amp; have temperature controls which may be a plus to some people.  When I use it, my hair smells burnt, there are indents on my hair and I have tons of flyaways that will never lay down.  I have used a couple of my friends flat irons and my hair with their flat irons is much more of my desired style.     It may be a good product for those with fine hair however if you have curly, wavy, or even ethnic hair, I would try another flat iron.</li>
    <li> The Farouk Flat Iron is AMAZING! Straightens hair in seconds without any heat damage. Definately a GREAT flat iron!</li>
    <li> I really love this flat iron! This is the 2nd biosilk flat iron that I have purchased. The first one, just recently,stopped working. But, I must admit,I can&#x27;t even remember when I first began to use it...years ago! If you are interested in an iron that does not snag your hair,and leaves it soft and shiny,this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that there is a temperature control was what really made up my mind on buying this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Good product, I use it all the time. More expensive ones are better but this does the job very well. Gets hot really fast. I&#x27;d buy it again, i like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener! I bought mine from TJMAXX months ago for 29.99!! Keep your eye out at stores like TJMAXX, MARSHALLS, ROSS, ect. My hair is kind of wavy and this straighter leaves it so silky. I set the heat to about 350. The max is 420. Not sure how this straightener would work on curly hair. It may take more than one run fofr curly hsir.</li>
    <li> I have thick medium length hair and I came across this item from a YouTube video about a girl talking about this straightener. I thought that it seemed pretty good, coming from Chi. So I ordered it and I received it today. The seller I bought it from had the box taped shut, so it was opened and it looked used. The heating doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for my hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone unless you have thin hair, otherwise no.</li>
    <li> I got this on sale and was so excited about it, and I hated it. I does not heat up hot enough form my hair. It might work fine for girls with thinner hair, but I half asian and its just not hot enough. Its that in between hot and warm ... and when i run it through my hair, my hair just comes out static. it litterally is standing up. horriable! like i said maybe it heats up enough for other girls thinner hair but did not work for my frizzy thick hair. i still love my paul mitchell!! :)</li>
    <li> I bought one of these last year and used it TWICE.  I tried to use it again yesterday and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  What a piece of garbage. I tried moving to a different outlet and reseting it but it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  For something coming from Farouk CHI you would think this would have some lasting power and have some workmanship behind it.  My drugstore straightener I&#x27;ve had for four years and it&#x27;s still working.  Piss poor job of straightening hair and I would never buy anything from CHI again.</li>
    <li> This straightner did not even last 4 months, I am completely unsatisfied with this and wish i could return it or at least exchange it for a new or different one. It completely wont turn on when I plug it in, I&#x27;ve tried everything!</li>
    <li> I just got this the other weekend and tried it out. the cord is nice and long which can come in handy if your outlet isnt close by. It has a surge protector built into it which is nice, none of the other flat irons I have used have has this. heats up to 400. does a great job.</li>
    <li> I love my biosilk flat iron! It heats up in just a few seconds and styles easily and quickly. I have very thin hair, which means, if there&#x27;s the slightest bit of humidity or drizzle, my hair gets disgusting and loses its style. Since I used this, it&#x27;s kept my cowlicks at bay in all weather! Woo! :) It also leaves my hair very soft because of the high quality tourmaline ceramic.     The BIG downside for me is that this product isn&#x27;t dual voltage. I travel about 4-5 times a year and have had to lug around my heavy voltage converter to avoid blowing the fuse on this iron. I&#x27;m going to invest now on a Babyliss flat iron with dual voltage. I wish I thought about his problem before I bought it.     If you&#x27;re not too much of an international traveller, this item is perfect.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and returned it the very next day. It did not work at all. Didn&#x27;t get switched on. Absolutely faulty product.</li>
    <li> Very nice flat iron. easy to use. I have tried other straighteners that have not worked well because they make my hair strait, and once I go outside (Florida is very hot u know) my hair frizzes up again. this flat iron has no problem with humidity, and your hair stays strait for like 2 days after straitening. The only thing that will make your hair curl up again is if you wet it.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I picked one up at a T.J. Maxx a couple years ago for like $30 and loved it. Its made by the same company as CHI, and I think it works great. This is the only straightener that after I use it, my hair stays straight. After the old one died, I tried to settle for another one I have, but it just wasn&#x27;t the same. So I sucked it up and bought this one. I love it. Cheap and it works great, what more could I ask for?</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and have been straitening it for many years.  I&#x27;ve never had the money to buy the very expensive salon flat irons, so I&#x27;ve made do with the cheaper ones from Revlon and Conair.  Recently, my Conair (with comb) started smelling like it was burning, so I knew I needed to get a new one.  I have a few friends who are hair stylists and they swear by Chi.  Well, I still didn&#x27;t have the money to buy the Chi and I missed out on the sale at JCPenney when they had them super cheap and my friend&#x27;s niece was able to get it with her discount. :  I was at Marshalls (where I work) and saw that they had gotten in the Biosilk flat iron.  I know Biosilk is the same company as Chi, so I decided to get it.  Well, let me tell you, it blows my cheap Conair away. Best part is, with my discount, it cost me LESS than my cheap Conair.  I used to have to run the iron thru my hair 3, sometimes 4 times for it to be completely straight and smooth.  With the Biosilk, I only ran it thru once, sometimes twice if I didn&#x27;t have a good pull on my hair.  With the Conair, I would have to put the Biosilk Silk Therapy in before AND after I straightened it, to get it nice and shiny.  With the Biosilk iron, I put the Silk Therapy in before I straitened it and that was it!  I  love my iron and for the price I paid for it, if it breaks, I&#x27;d STILL go out and buy another one.  If we ever get any more at Marshalls, I&#x27;m going to buy another one for a backup!</li>
    <li> I bought this flatiron for $45 on amazon to replace an older Chi. I did some research - looking around at other products/brands, and took a stab in the dark with his one. I am SO pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron heats up in about 10 seconds, and never catches my hair like the old one did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have course, but thin, hair, and this iron can curl, straighten, wave... I love it. I take it with me when I travel :)</li>
    <li> I have thin, fine hair so I need a good iron that doesn&#x27;t burn my hair or pull it. This one fit the bill and exceeded my expectations. It glides over my hair and never pulls it. I am so happy with it.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend was always complaining about her thingamabobber not getting hot enough for her hair. She has had a few. Conair, other ones.... Havent heard one gripe after buying her this one. And no gripey is a good thing! So i guess it is everything she wanted and hot enough.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron but this is my second one and the first one had bad power outlet and my new one is acting up now.</li>
    <li> My sister in law had this iron &amp; let me borrow it..that&#x27;s all it took! I luv it..works great!! Would definetly recommend it!! Great price also!</li>
    <li> I used to have one that i got from a website that doesnt exist anymore. It was great and it last me for about 4 years before i accidentally broke it lol this one was bought to replace that one because it was AMAZING! Now, i read that people posted that this one is not the same but ive had it for a few weeks and i like it. It does seem to take a bit longer to heat up but i feel it gives the same results. I love it so far and i am happy with my purchase :)</li>
    <li> Good product. Heats up fast. Different temperature settings are nice too. And for a good price!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for someone and they absolutely loved it. Easy to use, fast heat up and cool down, and an excellent price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightener for the past few years now. I needed one for college and this was the only one that I considered buying. The straightener works perfectly! Very reliable and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item on 6/6/14 for my wife &amp; the item didn&#x27;t work. I contacted the seller immediately for a full refund since my wife ended up buying a different flat iron &amp; it&#x27;s now 6/24 &amp; this is still unresolved. He told me that I&#x27;d be refunded IN FULL but I&#x27;ve had to continue to msg him daily for a return label &amp; all I get from him is excuses &amp; the run around. I&#x27;ve submitted a claim, this is BS&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Works great, but I have purchased this hair straightener twice and both times it had electrical problems and stopped turning on when plugged in. Both times it happened after about a year, but you would expect an expensive product to hold up better.</li>
    <li> Had one of these straighteners forever and it broke. Finally found another one online and it works just as well as the old one! Love it!</li>
    <li> I love the biosilk hair products, and thought their flat iron would be great too. Not so - the hottest setting will barely straighten my hair and it catches and yanks hairs out on every pass. I tried it for about three passes and put it back in the box to return - not worth the pain!</li>
    <li> I bought this iron for my girlfriend to replace a previous iron with a worn-out electrical adapter. She loves it. That&#x27;s all I know.</li>
    <li> After a while of sharing a flat iron with my sister ;P... I decided to purchase one for myself. What I had in mind was a CHI. I wanted a good quality flat iron that could not only straighten my hair well but curl too! And it HAD to curl. Flat iron curls are my favorite. ;) So I started my research and came across this one in a youtube tutorial. As you can imagine seeing a a &amp;#34;CHI&amp;#34; flat iron for around $30 sounded great! I bought it off here and received it within a week! It does everything I wanted it to. It makes beautiful curls and straightens my hair way better than the one I shared with my sister that 1. didn&#x27;t curl and 2. cost like $69?! Heats up very quick and has really cut down on my time getting ready in the morning. I can sometimes straighten all my hair in 5 minutes (before it would usually take 10-15) I love it!!!♥</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for my teenagers this Christmas.  1 says hers is working fine and the other ones broke after 2 uses.  The on/off switch is cheaply made and should be redesigned.  Save your receipts and boxes if you want to get thru one year with it.  I would rather buy the Sally Beauty Supply&#x27;s version of the Chi for $80 because I own that one myself and it is still working after 5+ years!</li>
    <li> Decent straighter, heats up fast, and leaves my hair pretty straight and silky; and my hair is super wavy and frizzy.</li>
    <li> This is second iron of the same make and model. My old one latest 6 years before it went in my luggage on a plane and got wrecked from the luggage being tossed around.</li>
    <li> this is my second purchase of this flat iron.  my first one lasted for a few years, but there was some sort of short in the wiring.  I liked the temperature control, and how the flat iron worked, so when my first one died, I knew I would just buy the same one again.  I haven&#x27;t seen a better flat iron for under $50!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron. Ive been looking for an affordable yet really good flat iron. This iron really does the trick and it make my hair super soft.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron back in &#x27;06 and absolutely love it. I&#x27;m pretty rough on things and it&#x27;s been a trooper the past 7 years. It doesn&#x27;t pull or yank on my hair in the slightest bit. I love how sturdy and solid it is. What sold me on it awhile back was that it had an adjustable heat setting. I have curly/wavy naturally unruly hair so I needed the heat-but liked that I could turn it down to do my bangs since it didn&#x27;t need to be so hot. I would definitely recommend this flat iron!</li>
    <li> Works just as well as a Chi (this is made by Farouk, the SAME makers of Chi) and makes my hair shiny and silky, with little to no damage. Gets VERY hot and has a temperature dial, so you can choose how hot you want it to get. Worth every penny! : )</li>
    <li> This item took awhile in the processing and shipping department but was delivered in excellent condition with no flaws.  The seller left a nice typed note thanking me for my purchase, as well as informing me of my return conditions which was very professional on their end.  The only problems that I encounter from time to time with this flat iron is that my hair gets stuck and pulled out (have to be extremely patient with this iron), and the cord becomes tangled.  It heats up to 420 degrees Fahrenheit (thick, curly hair &#x3D; high heat), but it seems to be resistant in some areas which feels as if it is not properly heated to the temperature it is set on.  With any heat styling product, especially this one, I went and purchased a thermal shield to mist on before styling.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this straightener, for me it turned my normal 2 hours to 15 minutes. Plus it makes my hair soft and so much less frizzy and curly than it was.</li>
    <li> Love this flat iron.  It&#x27;s cheap &amp; was shipped the next day.now I am currently waiting impatiently and cant wait !</li>
    <li> I previously owned this exact straightener. I bought it at ultra and loved it. It heated up quickly and only took one stroke to straighten my hair perfectly. When my straightener broke, I found this one online and got very excited to get the same great product. Little did I know, this product was a fake. It looks identical, but it barely heats up. It also is very rough on my hair and there are no degrees along the side. I am very disappointed and will NEVER buy a straightener online or from this seller again. What a fraud!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for almost a year. It works and my hair is soft and smooth afterwards. However, I&#x27;ve found I have had to continually increase the temperature of the iron for every use. This makes it difficult to work with as it becomes too hot for my fingers to hold as the iron is being run through my hair.</li>
    <li> I ordered and expected wonderful performance from Biosilk. I was disappointed and didn&#x27;t like the performance. Would have preferred a heat setting.</li>
    <li> my daughter had purchased Farouk Biosilk in the past and was interested in getting a second one for when hers eventually wore out.  We looked in hair salons but it was hard to find anything under $200. Cheaper hair straighteners could be found at big box stores but our experience was they didn&#x27;t work as well and frequently catch and pull your hair.  These are inexpensive but effective hair straighteners which we highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The flat iron is wonderful while its working.  I&#x27;ve bought 2.  The 2nd I bought from Amazon thinking the first one I bought was a dud.  Eventually the power plug will break an the flat iron will not power up.  I&#x27;ve given up on this iron and upgraded to a Chi.  We&#x27;ll have to see how long it last as it is made by the same company.</li>
    <li> Sadly i had to return this after a week. The iron would only turn on after jiggling the cord into the right place, and after one week wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all. Not okay.</li>
    <li> does anyone know if light is supposed to be a solid red or a flickering red light.  Just bought mine and red light flickers... not sure if it&#x27;s faulty or not!  Help!!!!</li>
    <li> I have stupidly thick, wild hair with two textues: straightish on top and curly underneath. Every strand is in identity crisis and determined to go its own way. I have tried several irons in the past (most recently an Andis), and while they straighten my hair, it&#x27;s left stiff and kind of dry-looking in spite of all the heat-protecting products. You know when you put straightened hair in a pony tail and sometimes it just kind of sticks out like an anime character instead of falling naturally? My hair was that. But this iron makes my hair so stinking soft and my hair looks like it&#x27;s naturally smooth. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself for fork over the cash for a Chi in spite of its amazing ratings, and this is definitely a great iron for budget-conscious folks. The only cons are that the heat only goes to 400 (not that you should use the fires of hell on your hair, but sometimes locks are too stubborn for low heat) and there is no &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; on the end to place your fingers to press the iron together when straightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> But this dude does the job. gets very hot! just doesnt make ur hair silky like chi&#x27;s do. But Good.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for myself about three years ago and though it still works, one of the pads has come apart from the blue shell.  I don&#x27;t recommend using it like this and, though it worked wonderfully while it was in tip-top shape, I was hoping it would have lasted me a while longer.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron from bed bath &amp; byond and it is only for $19.99 yes I mean this price and it is very good it turns very hot and makes very nice curls.&lt;br /&gt;I have been going through tons of flat irons but this one is very good and I recommend it for every one.</li>
    <li> Straightener did not work when I opened the package. Looked like it had been used. Had to return the item.</li>
    <li> I love this flatiron. It gets hot quickly and does an incredible job straightening my hair, which is frizzy and coarse. My friend had purchased one and spent over a a$100, this one was about $50 and well worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I got this as a present for my daughter and right out of the box it did not turn on, reset button did not work, tried multiple outlets.</li>
    <li> 2nd one i bought cuz 1st one didnt get hot.now this one does not heat up as well either</li>
    <li> The on/off switch doesn&#x27;t work but it does work properly otherwise.  This defect wasn&#x27;t worth sending the whole thing back but it was disappointing.</li>
