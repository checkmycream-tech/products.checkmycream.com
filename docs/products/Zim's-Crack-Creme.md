<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Within a few weeks I could see results</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff, it cured my cracked heel in 2 days. Very painful cracked heel and my pharmacist recommended this . AAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> I had used this before when my sister-in-law recommended it.  Then I forgot about it until a few weeks ago when I decided to use again on my heels after wearing flip flops during the summer.  What a difference it made in just a couple of weeks.  My heels are not cracked now and much smoother.</li>
    <li> A pedicurst used this product on my elderly dad&#x27;s feet while he was in hospice care.  My dad tended to be a gruff man who did not ever use someone besides a podiatrist to care for his feet.  He thought this type of service was pampering.  However, during his last weeks in hospice when the pedicurist came once a week he so looked forward to having his feet cleaned and massaged.  She used Zim&#x27;s Crack Creme, Diabetic Formula.  I bought this expecting one tube and got two.  It&#x27;s wonderful (I&#x27;m not a diabetic).  I would highly recommend this creme to anyone.  It&#x27;s particularly great for my feet during the summer months when I like to wear sandals.</li>
    <li> As a long time user of the Zim&#x27;s crack creme line - I prefer the Diabetic formula best. The herbal blend is very soothing on dry skin spots.  I carry a small tube of the regular formula in my vehicle for daytime use - it also is a great product. I will stick with the Zim&#x27;s line as long as they are available.</li>
    <li> Okay let first say I am a mechanic, my hands were rough and tough and felt like splintered wood.  I decided that my hands didn&#x27;t need to be this way, so I bought this stuff, and applied it every night, putting socks over my hands to help keep the moisture in.  In 2 weeks my hands are as a soft and pliable as my special lady friend hands.  I&#x27;m totally shocked.  This is without a doubt the best stuff I have every used for totally changing the makeup of your hands and skin.  I&#x27;m going to start doing this to my feet now.  Amazon please make this stuff available through prime membership.</li>
    <li> Works great in warm weather waiting to see how  it works in cold weather.</li>
    <li> The creme has an interesting, non perfumy, not unpleasant odor, absorbs well, and does soften ultra dry skin with continued use. One can&#x27;t ask for much more than that!</li>
    <li> This Creme is wonderful , I always had problem with my hands cracking and bleeding not any more. You don&#x27;t have to be diabetic to use this creme. I know nurses who use this because they have to wash their hand so much.</li>
    <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me works, I&#x27;ve suffered with dry, cracked skin on my hands for years, within 1 week cleared up, I apply it at least twice&lt;br /&gt;a day.</li>
    <li> When I bought it, it was recommended highly by a friend who uses it all the time.  I couldn&#x27;t get used to the so called &amp;#34;herbal smell&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> It really works on dry cracking skin.</li>
    <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me is amazing,  Filled in my cracks, stopped the itching and rough dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and recommend for anyone with dry cracked feet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you start using it, and then stop using it for a couple of weeks, you notice the difference.  It makes your feet crazy soft and smooth.  If you pair it with something that has Urea Acid in it, like Flexitol, then you will completely transform your feet.</li>
    <li> I have used a whole tube now and it works very well.  Probably the best lotion / cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Makes skin soft and&lt;br /&gt;not greasy, this is the best thing of this cream, the NO greasy feel. As one person stated, it has a smell that I found hard to&lt;br /&gt;take, but with anything, the more you use it the less it bothers you.  I just kept going back to it because it really works!&lt;br /&gt;Brian</li>

    <li> wonderful product but unavailable in most stores.  Thank goodness I found it on Amazon because it works GREAT!!!</li>
    <li> This product has performed beyond my expectations. It will renew dry cracked skin to its original state within a short period of time when used as directed. It restored my feet to the state they were when I was in my 20s. It will put Vaseline and other name brand lotions to shame when trying to restore dry skin.</li>
