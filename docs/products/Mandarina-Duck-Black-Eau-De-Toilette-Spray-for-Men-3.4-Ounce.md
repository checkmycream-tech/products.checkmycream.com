      <li>This is a very unique cologne and lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Price is great for frag that is worth 2x what it is worth.</li>

      <li>Got here very quick.</li>
      <li>Smells amazing I got a sample from Barney&#x27;s New York and fell in love with it.....</li>
      <li>I love this so much I have bought it twice for my husband because I love how he smells in it and on Amazon</li>
      <li>Product smelled good got to me in a timely fashion and overall satisfied with my purchase</li>
      <li>Manly, clean and a bit barber shop, its goooood.</li>
      <li>I have had several people ask me what I was wearing, because it smelled so good.</li>
      <li>Overall, it smells great and is very noticeable by others.</li>
      <li>If you want to show people you&#x27;re a little more mature (step aside Drakkar Noir) and can find some truly wonderful smells, I would highly recommend getting this.​</li>
      <li>Great fragance, my husband use it everyday.</li>
      <li>The smell good but not as expected.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth trying out if you haven&#x27;t already.</li>
      <li>Quick order, fast service!</li>
      <li>I first smelled this cologne at Dillards and instantly fell in love.</li>
      <li>The product was exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem as potent as the last bottle.</li>
      <li>Hard to find in department stores, and purchased on Amazon at an amazing price!  </li>
      <li>I also received it very quick after my order, I would definitely order this again.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Cathy B.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s similar to Armani Code, but a little more refined and better smelling.</li>
      <li>Smells clean and last throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>Mandarina Duck Black is one of my favorite scents to wear.</li>
      <li>This is my second order of Mandarina Duck Black - Love it!  </li>
      <li>It is not the fist time I buy this Eau De Toilette because I really love it and is not easy to find them on the stores.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very euro-scent, meaning that it&#x27;s a bit sweeter, more floral, less musky than what an American man might like.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old college student and have worn this throughout college.</li>
      <li>think polo double black, but different enough to be its own fragrance.  </li>
      <li>only bummer part doesn&#x27;t last very long.....and the mandarian duck black has a similar sweet scent like men&#x27;s freg.</li>
      <li>As far as setting, I would say it&#x27;s between everyday wear and &amp;#34;romantic.&amp;#34; It may lean a little more towards romantic, but I&#x27;ve noticed other people wearing it in public and it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>

    <li> Great scent. I spent quite some time in department stores smelling different colonges. This one stood out to me. As far as setting, I would say it&#x27;s between everyday wear and &amp;#34;romantic.&amp;#34; It may lean a little more towards romantic, but I&#x27;ve noticed other people wearing it in public and it&#x27;s not overbearing. It&#x27;s a very good scent. It&#x27;s similar to Armani Code, but a little more refined and better smelling.</li>

    <li> I first smelled this cologne at Dillards and instantly fell in love. It has all of the scents of a man: leather, pipe tobacco, mandarin orange, and several other scents. Overall, it smells great and is very noticeable by others. I have had several people ask me what I was wearing, because it smelled so good. And the price for this online is incredible. It is the same Eau de toilette sold in Dillards as well.</li>
    <li> good price, good ship</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this smell. It reminds me a lot to VIP 212 from Carolina Herrera, with better price. Nice smell and sillage. Very good value. Recommended!</li>
    <li> I love this so much I have bought it twice for my husband because I love how he smells in it and on Amazon it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than at the department store.</li>
