    <li> I add a few drops to my household cleaning products and it makes my house smell so fresh.  I love the unexpected grapefruit smell over your average fake lemon scented cleaners.  Can also be used to keep spiders away, just dab it around your windows.  I&#x27;ve heard it can also be used to keep cats off furniture, but mine don&#x27;t seem to mind it.</li>
    <li> This oil has worked wonders for me and my mom!!! In just a week sniffing and adding it to my water I have lost a lot of water weight and I have gotten compliments. I even use it as aromatherapy at work for those who need it I would definitely recommend this to everyone eapecially since I cannot stand the taste of grapefruit. This works best!</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
