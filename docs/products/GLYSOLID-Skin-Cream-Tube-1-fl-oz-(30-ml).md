    <li> It&#x27;s good.  Takes a long time for it to absorb, but definitely not greasy formula.  Will likely buy more.  I apply overnight because I put medication on my hands in the daytime.  Without the Glysolid @ night, my hands look really chapped.  My hairdresser got me started on this product.</li>
    <li> Works great and very effective. Have tried many other products and I like this the best of all of them so far, not very thick like vaseline.</li>
    <li> Glysolid was exactly what I expected it to be. It softens my fingertips and allow me to shuffle cards again.</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for dry hands.</li>
    <li> Just recently arrived, tried right away and I can feel the difference, makes my skin smooth and soft. Arrive in good condition.</li>

    <li> I really like this stuff. I can put it on, no matter where I am &amp; because it&#x27;s small enough to keep it in my purse. Not like the other stuff I use for my hands. I will deninately re-order this product.</li>

    <li> suggested by manicurist for cracked heels-really works</li>
    <li> The fastest absorbing cream out there. This stuff just penetrates the skin yet provides an outer coating to repel the outside elements. I don&#x27;t know how they do it! The smell is a bit medicinal, but very faint.&lt;br /&gt;The best travel cream ever. I have this in my purse and use it all the time, especially in the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for supplying this!</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with this product.  It is too solid for what I needed it for.  I am keeping it just in case.</li>
    <li> This by far the best cream i used.&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of manual work and need a cream that keep my hands and arm skin in a good shape.&lt;br /&gt;Glysolid cream is a bit thick however adding a small amount of water to it in the palm of the hand and rubbing it against the skin ease the spreading of the cream.</li>
    <li> Works very well,  received quickly!!!</li>
