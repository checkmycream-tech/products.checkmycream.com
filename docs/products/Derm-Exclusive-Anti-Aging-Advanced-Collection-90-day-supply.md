### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>So happy!</li>
      <li>Both still look as beautiful as ever!</li>
      <li>Wonderful product.</li>
      <li>What is in this collection is GREAT!</li>
      <li>This stuff is the BEST!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the lotions or pads either.</li>
      <li>I am very happy with the speed and efficiency of my order.</li>
      <li>I loved it!</li>
      <li>These are both wonderful products and show good results on already well cared for skin.</li>
      <li>&quot; (if you are happy</li>
      <li>but I was hoping for great.</li>
      <li>AMAZING product!</li>
      <li>all smell pleasant</li>
      <li>So in conclusion, I would recommend this product line with the understanding that you must use these products (I use them day and night - except the pads) as directed for good results.</li>
      <li>The Derm Exclusive products are good</li>
      <li>Good mosturizer</li>
      <li>This works great, worth the money!</li>
      <li>They have a great special for doing that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, the texture and feel of my skin was immediately noticeable but now after 45 days, I can say that I do see some very light smoothing of lines and lightening of sunspots (I am 54).</li>
      <li>The two products that I absolutely love are the Intensive Repair Serum and the Collagen Lift.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.  </li>
      <li>ppl say my skin looks better</li>
      <li>It really works!!!!</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t  be this upset if it hadn&#x27;t cost so much!!!!</li>
      <li>The system is easy to use and the moisturizer works quite well.</li>
      <li>it is for people with very mild skin issues.</li>
      <li>Both of these are lotions and dispense smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it still feels good.</li>
      <li>I sell Mary Kay and I love their new Anti-aging serums and products, but this is even better.  </li>
      <li>He was right!</li>
      <li>The freeze and fill has done a good job of filling wrinkles, especially in the eye area.  </li>
      <li>I did not see results from the fill and freeze and actually use another product which works better over the top of this.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Yes, I like it because it&#x27;s simple, BUT I love it for the results!</li>
      <li>I have lived in pain all my life, and the smile lines that everyone \\&quot;earns\\</li>
      <li>I was actually introduced to this product by my father who thought it would be a nice gift for me.</li>
      <li>It is gentle on my skin and it has definitely made my skin more even toned and smooth.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;IT makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>You can get these sets WAY cheaper through a BeachBody coach though, and they offer money back guarantees with their products like this one AND shakeology, P90X and more.</li>
      <li>It makes a difference especially in the morning when my skin is more dehydrated.</li>
      <li>It really works!</li>
      <li>I tried SO many different brands</li>
      <li>Missing product, had to return however have bought before and is a good product</li>
      <li>I know I feel better about my appearance, and I&#x27;m going to continue using as long as I can.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel clean and my skin does look better after a few months use.</li>
      <li>It is available in generic form and very reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>keep in mind that allergic reactions can occur with any product - it is a good idea to do a skin test patch when starting with any new topical product.</li>
      <li>I guess I would still need my dermatologist to fix my fine lines or moderate pre wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The downfall is the 90 day pack really isn&#x27;t for 3 months.  </li>
      <li>Something should be done, and Amazon really needs to warn the consumer.  </li>
      <li>I really like the serum and cleanser a lot.</li>
      <li>With all the hype on the infomercial and the doctors show, I really had confidence in this product.  </li>
      <li>I am 68 years old and a diabetic, thus my skin is very dry and getting more wrinkled every day.</li>
      <li>This is the only product that can actually penetrate the dermal layer of the skin to correct fine lines and help with skin smoothing.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and have my enitre 58 years.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products, just do not buy them directly from Beach Body.  </li>
      <li>I have had an esthetician license and worked in the cosmetic industry for many years trying many products, both very expensive as well as inexpensive.</li>
      <li>Yet, on the positive side, after only 2 times using the Peel Pads I noticed a visible reduction in the darkness and depth to an age spot</li>
      <li>I noticed a clear difference in the appearance of my skin within one week.</li>
      <li>My grandmother absolutely wanted this which is the only reason why I bought it.</li>
      <li>I have used the Drm Exclusive for 2 years now, and it has both rejuvenated my skin with moisture, but has taken the discoloring and age spots almost completely away.  </li>
      <li>First you use the Micro Peel Resurfacing Pads (45 pads, one for every other night).</li>
      <li>Ive been using this for a couple of months and so far I have actually had</li>

<li> Not worth the money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not know if it does what it says. Maybe its my skin</li>
    <li> It does work. You do need to use it for at least a month to really see results but I did start to notice a difference after a couple of weeks.  Dark spots are definitely fading and my skin looks fresher.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and it is everything it is claimed to be. I am 68 years old and a diabetic, thus my skin is very dry and getting more wrinkled every day. I have used the Drm Exclusive for 2 years now, and it has both rejuvenated my skin with moisture, but has taken the discoloring and age spots almost completely away.  The freeze and fill has done a good job of filling wrinkles, especially in the eye area.  I highly recommend these products, just do not buy them directly from Beach Body.  They are unorganized and have very poor system for renewing order every 90 days.  I plan to reorder my products from Amazon, as I did with this order.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the BEST! I tried SO many different brands and I have finally found this. You can get these sets WAY cheaper through a BeachBody coach though, and they offer money back guarantees with their products like this one AND shakeology, P90X and more. When you buy those programs from other sites you do not get the entire package. Compare at [...]</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work correctly it is for people with very mild skin issues. I guess I would still need my dermatologist to fix my fine lines or moderate pre wrinkles. I also have tear troughs and i thought that this product cold help and overall it hasn&#x27;t helped with anything at all. This was the biggest waste of money. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anybody.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the speed and efficiency of my order.</li>
    <li> Good mosturizer but that&#x27;s about it. Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Was very expensive for what you get and one of the tubes had a hole in it which caused of lot of the product to spill out. My grandmother absolutely wanted this which is the only reason why I bought it. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was actually introduced to this product by my father who thought it would be a nice gift for me. He was right! I have very sensitive skin and have my enitre 58 years. I loved it! It is gentle on my skin and it has definitely made my skin more even toned and smooth. I&#x27;ve been using Derm Exclusive for 9 months now.  I will continue to order it!</li>
    <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.  Promises all kinds of things and it doesn&#x27;t happen.  Wouldn&#x27;t  be this upset if it hadn&#x27;t cost so much!!!!</li>
    <li> Ive been using this for a couple of months and so far I have actually had ppl say my skin looks better</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had 30 days with the product yet so I can&#x27;t comment on the effectiveness yet. However, the Fill and Freeze little tube is so frustrating to work with. I have to mangle it up to get a little of the product out. It may help with wrinkles but getting it out makes my hands hurt. Yet, on the positive side, after only 2 times using the Peel Pads I noticed a visible reduction in the darkness and depth to an age spot I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got was a simple 4 step program with enough product for 90 days. First you use the Micro Peel Resurfacing Pads (45 pads, one for every other night). You just put this on and when it dries add the Intensive Repair Serum and then the Collagen Lift. Both of these are lotions and dispense smoothly and easily. You end with the little monster container of Fill &amp; Freeze® Wrinkle Treatment. When you do get it out, this is another lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated this only 4 stars due to the Fill and Freeze morning mangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all smell pleasant</li>
    <li> This product is a miracle. I use it every day and night&lt;br /&gt;IT makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.I&#x27;m in my late 60 s and Derm Exclusive has given me even  and soft skin tone. Less visible wrinkles and such elasticity.  This is the one product among all others.  It really works!!!!</li>
    <li> The system is easy to use and the moisturizer works quite well. I really like the serum and cleanser a lot.</li>
    <li> AMAZING product! It really works! I can see such a difference.  The downfall is the 90 day pack really isn&#x27;t for 3 months.  If you look at the volume size on the bottles it is only 2 times the amount of the 1 month supply. I have ordered it several times because of it working so well and every time the product doesn&#x27;t last past 2 months.  They also have reduced the size of the second tube of Fill &amp;amp; Freeze. It is a sample size, not a full tube size.  The Fill &amp;amp; Freeze is the key to this product working. So you are in a bind because they don&#x27;t sell it individually.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, but false advertising on length of supply!!!!! Beware!</li>
    <li> I like it. It makes my face feel clean and my skin does look better after a few months use. I have sensitive skin and it still feels good.</li>
    <li> I have had an esthetician license and worked in the cosmetic industry for many years trying many products, both very expensive as well as inexpensive. The Derm Exclusive products are good but I was hoping for great. I guess that \\&quot;over the counter\\&quot; miracle in a bottle still doesn&#x27;t exist but that said, I did see results from this product line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the texture and feel of my skin was immediately noticeable but now after 45 days, I can say that I do see some very light smoothing of lines and lightening of sunspots (I am 54). I did not see results from the fill and freeze and actually use another product which works better over the top of this. The two products that I absolutely love are the Intensive Repair Serum and the Collagen Lift. These are both wonderful products and show good results on already well cared for skin. I would purchase these individually but it doesn&#x27;t make financial sense with the 90 day package price at this time. So in conclusion, I would recommend this product line with the understanding that you must use these products (I use them day and night - except the pads) as directed for good results. They do work well with other product line items (cleansers, masks, hydrating creams, et).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you over the age of 45 to 50, I would suggest speaking with your doctor about the mildest form of Retin-A. This is the only product that can actually penetrate the dermal layer of the skin to correct fine lines and help with skin smoothing. It is available in generic form and very reasonably priced. Must be used with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Also keep in mind that allergic reactions can occur with any product - it is a good idea to do a skin test patch when starting with any new topical product.</li>
    <li> The item only for 45 day not for 90 day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since April and I like it because it&#x27;s simple.  I have never used a product that asks me to do twice daily routines...but this aging tomboy has tried to keep to the routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I like it because it&#x27;s simple, BUT I love it for the results! I have lived in pain all my life, and the smile lines that everyone \\&quot;earns\\&quot; (if you are happy enough)anyway I additionally carry deep crevices from gritting my teeth AND brushing my teeth!  The product truly helps with those lines. I try to use as directed, but find I skip the evening apps. occasionally.  Still, people think I&#x27;ve lost weight (!) or have been on vacation.  I know I feel better about my appearance, and I&#x27;m going to continue using as long as I can.  I am having a problem with an overload of product coming to my house, and will contact seller to lighten up.  Some of the products are being stored in my garage already.</li>
    <li> have used for 2 weeks. it is moe of a skin moisturizer but my oil of alay is cheaper and does the same job</li>
    <li> I am getting very frustrated by companies that don&#x27;t deliver products as promised, and then make it so difficult to cancel delivery.  Something should be done, and Amazon really needs to warn the consumer.  A terrible product, better to hit the drug store and by the Olay top line product.  You really need to read the reviews, a waste of money, does not work as promised.</li>
    <li> The fill &amp; freeze stuff is awful. It&#x27;s sticky and you cannot wear it under or over makeup because it clots up and you can see it. There is also hardly any product in the tubes. I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the lotions or pads either. Big waste of money.</li>
    <li> Missing product, had to return however have bought before and is a good product</li>
    <li> It works, it works, it works. So happy! I love this product. My wrinkles disappeared in one day. Yay me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again for sure.  It makes a difference especially in the morning when my skin is more dehydrated.</li>
    <li> I noticed a clear difference in the appearance of my skin within one week. I just wish they had included the Timeless Secret that was in my first order, but something must be strange cause I had to get it from Ebay! What is in this collection is GREAT!</li>
    <li> I sell Mary Kay and I love their new Anti-aging serums and products, but this is even better.  Got it on the promotion they are running.  I am 71 and have a harder type of skin to look young.  It does make it smoother and has taken away a lot of the dark sun spots.  Helps my makeup to stay on longer too closing the pores.  Try it.  They have a great special for doing that.</li>
    <li> bought for wife and daughter. they have no complaints they are voicing to me!  Both still look as beautiful as ever!</li>
    <li> With all the hype on the infomercial and the doctors show, I really had confidence in this product.  No such luck. It is not better than any other cream you can get at a drugstore. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> This works great, worth the money!</li>
