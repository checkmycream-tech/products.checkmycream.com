    <li> I already use the Moroccanoil Curl Control Creme, which is hydrating. This is super-hydrating. A little goes a long way, and it helps the driest part of my hair and my ends. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I Love This Moroccanoil Cream. It keeps my hair soft and moisturized. Ships Very Fast. I highly recommend Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really tell this product is in unless you use a god awful amount... does leave a more natural look though.</li>
    <li> Great hair product for thick hair. My curls are more defines and less frizz. My hair is soft and shiny and this product defines my curls.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product that I&#x27;ve tried and in fact plan on ordering more. It makes me hair feel so soft plus it&#x27;s easier to detangle as well. Furthermore it smells Great! I have already received compliments by people wanting to know what I use in my hair.</li>
    <li> Recently had a hairdresser tell me she could get me this product at her salon for a &amp;#34;steal&amp;#34; of a mear $35.00 - really?&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I looked the product up on Amazon and guess what, not only was I able to purchase the product at a big savings but the shipment of the product was wonderful. This product is wonderful and used according to directions the results are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;Look up your products on Amazon for the best deals anywhere.</li>
    <li> I bleached my hair so I am ALWAYS smoothing this stuff on my hair after I dry it and before bed. Helps give body and lessens the dryness</li>
    <li> Have used this styling cream for ages.  If you have a sensitive scalp that gets itchy from a lot of hair products, this is a great one to use.  Love the smell and never greasy or heavy!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product ever.  I have somewhat naturally curly hair and live in a geographic area with hard water, and this product makes my hair smooth and very healthy.  Even my hairdresser has commented on how healthy my hair is!</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product for moisturizing hair ( wet or dry).  Just a little works fine, and the fragrance is lovely!  Travel size what what i needed to pack for vacation.  Have the larger pump size at home.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my dry hair easy to style and my hair looks shinny and healthier.</li>
    <li> The product works well. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I like how the hair feels so soft and not weighed down after it gets dry.</li>
    <li> My stylist first put this in my hair and I just loved the smell. I will be buying a much bigger container next time.</li>
    <li> I purchased product in March 2014. When I used product it didn&#x27;t work well, only to come back to product yesterday 5/20/14 and find out it EXPIRED September 2013!!! I contacted seller telling them this and that I would like a refund of which they stated they would only take back UNOPENED/UNUSED product ( Shame on me, I should have checked first for expiration date, but I shouldn&#x27;t have to)&lt;br /&gt;I challenge everyone to check your product! You can find the expiration date on the top in the seam, I wonder how many expired products are out there.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very upset that I was lied to and even more so that the seller wouldn&#x27;t make it right. No where in the description did it say that I was purchasing a $19.00 product to include shipping and tax for something that expired last year.&lt;br /&gt;A photo of the product with the expired date was sent to the seller as well.&lt;br /&gt;All I wanted was a refund..</li>
    <li> I really like this for applying to hair after washing. I use with Lush R&amp;B before I blow dry my hair.</li>
