      <li>this review helps,happy -healthy- hair ladies</li>
      <li>to love it</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;ONLY&amp;#34; wrap-set lotion that I will allow on my relaxed healthy hair.(pixie cut)</li>
      <li>I love Kera Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meme</li>
      <li>I love my hair-</li>
      <li>.. Be sure to use the foam wrap lotion with the kera car humidity block oil sheen...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and may I add the price is great.</li>
      <li>I normally use Narobi setting lotion and it is great with the shine and softness it puts into your hair</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and did the job nicely</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since returned to an all time favorite with Avlon and will keep it readily available as it aides in an at home smooth wrap.</li>
      <li>but I used this foam wrap for the first time about a week ago and the volume in my hair is amazing</li>
      <li>and I have a good amount of new growth, so</li>
      <li>you may choose what&#x27;s best for your hair.(4)Rinse with WARM never HOT water (5) use a generous amount of Avlon Keracare Wrap-Set and a high quality comb to mold the hair or roller set.(5)</li>
      <li>It is a great lotion for wrapping or setting fine textured relaxed hair without a big sticky build up.</li>
      <li>Best money I ever spent!!!</li>
      <li>it comes out bouncy and light.</li>
      <li>but if it&#x27;s not time for a relaxer yet and if you are doing a roller set,go fast before your hair dries as that is when you have to add more</li>
      <li>I am still on the quest for my absolute favorite wrap lotion and have tried many professional brands.</li>
      <li>Go under the dryer, then my hair in straight and smooth.</li>
      <li>For freshly relaxed hair it works well</li>
      <li>This gives you a really nice smooth wet wrap, holds everything in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>went under the dryer for a bit, and the drying surprisingly didn&#x27;t take long thanks to this lotion.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s so very important to use all natural oils not those filled with perfume,mineral oil,petroleum &amp; other agents(3) condition hair with a light sulfate free product .I&#x27;m a fan of WEN (Fig &amp; Six Thirteen)however</li>
      <li>Did make hair soft and smell good and would use if I wanted regular curls not roller curls.</li>
      <li>This product is the reason I continue to wear my hair natural, it provides that hold that my fine hair needed.</li>
      <li>This is great, not flaky or hard once you comb out.</li>
      <li>My hair feels different than it did before, softer and more malleable.  </li>
      <li>This did exactly as described.</li>
      <li>: I&#x27;m funny about what I spend my money on</li>
      <li>I love this product I have a short haircut</li>
      <li>My goodness, it saved my hair!I think I&#x27;ll do roller setting next time. :)</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and will definitely repurchase again!!</li>
      <li>I think I used too much the first time around (3 pumps)so</li>
      <li>This wrapping foam is versatile in that I can wrap my hair with it dry or wet and still get great results.</li>
      <li>but my friend absolutely loves it.</li>
      <li>There is actiually a whole chapter on ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>SOOOO much bounce afterwards--</li>
      <li>I saw this wrap lotion featured in a you tube video and really wanted to try it but had the hardest time finding it in any nearby stores, of course Amazon had it and after it arrived</li>
      <li>throwing away my other mousses and buying more of this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product works better than anyother wrap product i have tried it really lays your hair down</li>
      <li>This is the best setting lotion for thick and course hair african american hair.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many other wrapping foams but always return to Avlon Keracare!</li>
      <li>This lotion was just as expected and came very quickly.</li>
      <li>I only apply heat 1-2 times weekly,I always sleep on a satin pillow case or wrap with a silk scarf open at top to allow my scalp to remain cooler and breathe.**Hope</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>Remember though that the other aspects of care including the protection of hair at night and gentle handling of the hair are important.  </li>
      <li>so I get obsessive when it comes to reading reviews before purchasing damn near any and everything, so coming from a real reviewer, hope this helps.</li>
      <li>I decided a week later to wash my hair myself (to save a couple dollars) and try to mimic what the stylist did, except I had this QP wrap lotion (that got a ton of surprisingly good reviews - not sure why) instead of the Kera Care</li>
      <li>I find that the Kera care line leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
      <li>It made my hair so soft!</li>
      <li>SOFT, MANAGEABLE, and SHINNY!  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair soft, silky, and manageable!</li>
      <li>I can hardly wash my hair properly but these two products definitely do most of the work for you!     </li>
      <li>I went to a ethnic hair salon, and my stylist used this foam wrap and the hair came out so soft, i took a picture of it, and went on here and bought it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for those of us with relaxed hair, especially short styles.  </li>
      <li>I will recommend this to anyone that wants to keep your curls soft or just want to wrap your hair, blow dry, or set.</li>
      <li>Here are a few tips that may help you maintain your mane at home or salon.(1) cleanse with sulfate free cleanser (2) immediately following cleansing-light coconut oil,jojoba oil or Argan oil</li>
      <li>I have thick long Mexican hair and this is the only thing that will allow my curls to say for more than a day!</li>
      <li>It also made my hair very very soft and not hard as other brands.</li>
      <li>Back to all natural and organic where possible.</li>
      <li>I recently got a short hair cut and needed a foam wrap-set lotion that would make the back and the sides of my hair lay down in a certain way.</li>

<li> Not this one, after wrapping and drying my hair with the lotion, my hair is so soft when I take it down.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is great, not flaky or hard once you comb out. This gives you a really nice smooth wet wrap, holds everything in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very short cut. I tie paper wrap strips on after setting with the foam. Go under the dryer, then my hair in straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> I USE ALL THERE PRODUCTS. MAKES YOUR HAIR SMELL VERY GOOD. ALSO SHOULD TRY THE SHAMPOO, AND CONDITION. VERY GOOD.</li>
    <li> I used this Keracare Foam Wrapping Lotion to wet wrap my hair. I am impressed with the extra hold it provides. I normally use Narobi setting lotion and it is great with the shine and softness it puts into your hair but it has practically no hold at all so I love that this has a nice hold without any flaking or stiffness. However, I did not like the smell. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell... Just smells like dish washing liquid. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m not used to it.</li>
    <li> Normally I dislike mousse products because they never seem to give my hair that long-lasting body/volume I need for my thick hair. I heard about this product via youtube reviews and decided to give it a shot. I am so glad I did. I was too lazy to rollerset, so I ended up curling my hair with my flat iron. After getting out of the shower I put on my usual leave-in/heat protectant products and then added this stuff to my hair. I think I used too much the first time around (3 pumps)so I will lighten it up a bit next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ANYWAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went under the dryer for a bit, and the drying surprisingly didn&#x27;t take long thanks to this lotion. Afterwards I cooled down my hair with my blow dryer and proceeded to do my curling. SOOOO much bounce afterwards--and I have a good amount of new growth, so you know this does wonders! It didn&#x27;t leave my hair dry like some of the mousses I used in the past, and I still have that bounce 48 hours after applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m throwing away my other mousses and buying more of this stuff. My goodness, it saved my hair!I think I&#x27;ll do roller setting next time. :)</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, silky, and manageable!</li>
    <li> Just recently cut my hair really short, relaxed and colored it blonde. This is the product my hairdresser used to wrap my hair before she put me under the dryer and my hair came out bouncy, shiney, and silkier than ever. I decided a week later to wash my hair myself (to save a couple dollars) and try to mimic what the stylist did, except I had this QP wrap lotion (that got a ton of surprisingly good reviews - not sure why) instead of the Kera Care and it was HORRIBLE - hair came out a bit dry and flakey. That night I went on to Amazon and bought the Kera Care styling lotion, as well as the sulfate-free detangling shampoo and OH EM GEE, my hair was CRAZY soft and shiney once I was done. Even after using the flat iron to style it, my hair was salon quality, and believe me when I tell you...I&#x27;m no stylist. I can hardly wash my hair properly but these two products definitely do most of the work for you!     Sidebar: I&#x27;m funny about what I spend my money on so I get obsessive when it comes to reading reviews before purchasing damn near any and everything, so coming from a real reviewer, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> This lotion was just as expected and came very quickly. I am pleased and would reccomend this product to others looking for a wrap lotion</li>
    <li> I saw this wrap lotion featured in a you tube video and really wanted to try it but had the hardest time finding it in any nearby stores, of course Amazon had it and after it arrived and I used it I was in heaven. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair all sticky and its got good hold but keeps it light to where you still have freedom of movement with your hair. I absolutely love it and will definitely repurchase again!!</li>
    <li> Normally after washing my hair, its all dull and has little to no volume but I used this foam wrap for the first time about a week ago and the volume in my hair is amazing.. Be sure to use the foam wrap lotion with the kera car humidity block oil sheen... Yes their both expensive but sometimes its worth splurging on hair care products!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product of over 15 years now. I like that there is no residue on my hair when it dries and no flaking. This wrapping foam is versatile in that I can wrap my hair with it dry or wet and still get great results. I have tried many other wrapping foams but always return to Avlon Keracare!</li>
    <li> Did not hold curls for longer than 2 days. White build up when it gets dry/older. Did make hair soft and smell good and would use if I wanted regular curls not roller curls.</li>
    <li> This product is the reason I continue to wear my hair natural, it provides that hold that my fine hair needed. I love my hair- I love Kera Care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meme</li>
    <li> I believe this product works fairly well but I did not find it to hold curls for as long as I would have hoped.</li>
    <li> Product does noT hold hair well. Nairobi wrap foam is the best.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It is a great lotion for wrapping or setting fine textured relaxed hair without a big sticky build up.</li>
    <li> great wrapping lotion dries hair faster and curls hold when I roller set it. would recommend. leave hair with a nice shine.</li>
    <li> The product is wonderful on the hair. Unlike other wrap lotions I have used it actually makes hair soft and flowy. When I flat iron with my Sedu it comes out bouncy and light. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I find that the Kera care line leaves my hair very soft and manageable.  I use this product to wrap my relaxed hair after washing with the Chi moisturizing shampoo and conditioning with a Keracare conditioner.  My hair feels different than it did before, softer and more malleable.  The frizz has been tamed for the most part.  I highly recommend it for those of us with relaxed hair, especially short styles.  Remember though that the other aspects of care including the protection of hair at night and gentle handling of the hair are important.  I also recommend reading the book \\&quot;Great Hair\\&quot; by Nick Arrojo[[ASIN:B002IT5OMK Great Hair: Secrets to Looking Fabulous and Feeling Beautiful Every Day]].  There is actiually a whole chapter on ethnic hair.</li>
    <li> It was a okay mousse, Love the smell but it gets kind of too sticky feeling for me. I am still on the quest for my absolute favorite wrap lotion and have tried many professional brands. For freshly relaxed hair it works well but if it&#x27;s not time for a relaxer yet and if you are doing a roller set,go fast before your hair dries as that is when you have to add more and then the sticky residue builds up. I added  water to offset that feel.&lt;br /&gt;Want to love it but it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product I have a short haircut and when I wrap it leave my hair nice and shiny no flakes lots of body. I will be ordering more about to run out.I highly recommend this product and may I add the price is great.</li>
    <li> Works wonders with my thick wavy hair!</li>
    <li> I must admit i didn&#x27;t buy this product for myself but my friend absolutely loves it. So a big yes to this also. I&#x27;m sure she will want more</li>
    <li> I saw this product on one of those you tube how to videos and even though it is more expensive then some other products out there I decided to try it. Best money I ever spent!!!</li>
    <li> I went to a ethnic hair salon, and my stylist used this foam wrap and the hair came out so soft, i took a picture of it, and went on here and bought it. When I used it, my hair came out just like I just went to the salon. SOFT, MANAGEABLE, and SHINNY!  The greatest thing is the softness. YOU DON&#x27;T get that with other Foam wraps! I will recommend this to anyone that wants to keep your curls soft or just want to wrap your hair, blow dry, or set. I vouch for this Wrap Lotion!</li>
    <li> Great wrapping lotion!  It made my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> I recently got a short hair cut and needed a foam wrap-set lotion that would make the back and the sides of my hair lay down in a certain way. This did exactly as described. It also made my hair very very soft and not hard as other brands. My hair lays down for about five days, with using a mesh cap at night. I am very pleased and will continue to buy.</li>
    <li> I have used this product about three times.  I guess it does what is says.  Its a little early to say what its doing for my hair.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and did the job nicely</li>
    <li> Not sure if just my hair&#x27;s reaction to this product but after using it I had a lot of hair in my comb and brush. Moreso than I&#x27;ve ever had. Thankfully I have a head full of long thick hair. But I will never use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to basics. Back to all natural and organic where possible.</li>
    <li> This product works better than anyother wrap product i have tried it really lays your hair down&lt;br /&gt;and no flakes.</li>
    <li> For the price with shipping I was very disappointed! It left my hair dry and brittle! Avlon has wonderful products, I know they could do better!</li>
    <li> love it, good conditioner i love how my hair looks when i wrap it, bounces and nice.</li>
    <li> ALL HAIR TYPES ARE DIFFERENT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS FOR YOU.&lt;br /&gt;THIS WORKED GREAT ON MY HAIR AFTER AN IMMEDIATE SHAMPOO.  NOT ON JUST DRY HAIR. LEFT A STICKY FILM ON MY HAIR</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;ONLY&amp;#34; wrap-set lotion that I will allow on my relaxed healthy hair.(pixie cut) Many salons like Nairobi Wrapp ,which after use Nairobi may leave my hair shiny after a wrap ,yet my hair has a sticky residue and my scalps itches terribly. I&#x27;ve since returned to an all time favorite with Avlon and will keep it readily available as it aides in an at home smooth wrap.Here are a few tips that may help you maintain your mane at home or salon.(1) cleanse with sulfate free cleanser (2) immediately following cleansing-light coconut oil,jojoba oil or Argan oil treatment;ladies it&#x27;s so very important to use all natural oils not those filled with perfume,mineral oil,petroleum &amp; other agents(3) condition hair with a light sulfate free product .I&#x27;m a fan of WEN (Fig &amp; Six Thirteen)however you may choose what&#x27;s best for your hair.(4)Rinse with WARM never HOT water (5) use a generous amount of Avlon Keracare Wrap-Set and a high quality comb to mold the hair or roller set.(5) I apply 3-wrap papers and sit under a hood dryer for about 20-30 minutes. Lastly in styling save oil for sealing ends after a heat style; as it may cause hair to burn. Apply an organic cold press coconut oil to my hair nightly and wrap hair to maintain my moisturized and healthy hair style.I only apply heat 1-2 times weekly,I always sleep on a satin pillow case or wrap with a silk scarf open at top to allow my scalp to remain cooler and breathe.**Hope this review helps,happy -healthy- hair ladies**</li>
    <li> Love AVALON products! this wraping lotion delivered!</li>
    <li> This is the best setting lotion for thick and course hair african american hair.  Normally, some setting lotions leave your hair dry and crackly when taking your hair down.  Not this one, after wrapping and drying my hair with the lotion, my hair is so soft when I take it down. It&#x27;s unbelievable.  My daughters hairdresser used this on her hair  and swore by it.  Keracare products, for the most part, are excellent products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a lot of it either.  One bottle lasted a little over three months. I not only use it for wraps, I use it when roller setting my hair as well.  It&#x27;s versatile in that sense.  It also has a very nice fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I have thick long Mexican hair and this is the only thing that will allow my curls to say for more than a day! I used about 2-3 pump and I pin curled it, instead of using sponge rollers</li>
    <li> My product looks as if it has been used I will never purchase again</li>
    <li> I like the product; however, what they sent me expired two years ago.  So, be sure to pay close attention to the expiration date on your product.</li>
