      <li>Nice tint.</li>

      <li>Love Dermalogica products.  </li>

      <li>Love this even better my skin love it.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff I use it instead of foundation</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t plug my pores unlike many products.</li>
      <li>I mix it with another sunscreen to create a light foundation color.</li>
      <li>It gives me protection from the sun and is a light tint.</li>
      <li>This product is good if you have sensitive skin, plus it has sun protection.</li>
      <li>When I needed more I ordered online and the product wasn&#x27;t as fresh and smooth as the first tube I purchased in person.</li>
      <li>Very greasy and shiny in the sun exposure !!  </li>
      <li>Love Dermalogica in general and recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I received this product in reasonable time.</li>
      <li>this is a tint so it will rub off on white or light clothing/linens.</li>
      <li>A real shame -</li>
      <li>I actually looked up info and reviews after noticing that the sunscreen left my face incredibly greasy/shiny and read that this was due to a new formulation.</li>
      <li>I love this product because of its creamy texture, the slight coloring and - last not least - the SPF 30.</li>

      <li>I would use the Dermalogica Ultra sensitive tint time and again.  </li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin on my face.</li>
      <li>Like myself with ache, I&#x27;m just used to the old ways before Dermalogica changed its products.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s heavy &amp; light enough to cover all the skin splotches.</li>
      <li>You might think that given what it does do that 3 stars is a little ungenerous but the amount of shine it causes is so extreme that I end up blotting aggressively and probably removing most of it in the end anyway.</li>
      <li>I am currently 38yrs old, and have combination / oily skin.</li>
      <li>Not dry or oily.</li>
      <li>I used to stock up and reorder regularly but now am moving on to Elta MD UV Physical Broad Spectrum SPF 41.</li>
      <li>Much heavier product than the Dermalogica Ultra Sensitive SPF 25 of the past</li>
      <li>Cons : It is very thick like a mud and it gives very very whitening !!</li>
      <li>Feels a little greasy and does not provide much coverage.</li>

<li> I have rosacea and this is moisturizing while at the same time the tint tones down my redness.</li>
<li> The 3 stars are for: being a physical block w titanium dioxide, not having an offensive odor, a little going a long way, not leaving a white/chalky tint, and not causing breakouts.</li>
<li> It is not suitable for sensitive skin.</li>
<li> but if you fluff your face with a bronzer, that&#x27;ll work, too.</li>
<li> I still sometimes have to use a little coverup if I have breakouts.</li>
<li> so you&#x27;re not getting a heavy coverage</li>
<li> Use this everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 47 and don&#x27;t need make up with this, just a little powder!</li>
<li> Not sure if it is the vendor I bought from this time</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find a sunscreen that is Titanium Dioxide only.&lt;br</li>
<li> I like the faint scent too.</li>
<li> 5-6 mos after I bought it, that seems weird to me</li>
<li> I use it as a base for my make up.  </li>
<li> It is the worst product I have ever used.</li>

    <li> Feels a little greasy and does not provide much coverage.</li>
    <li> Cons : It is very thick like a mud and it gives very very whitening !! Very greasy and shiny in the sun exposure !!  It contains components  which irritate the skin and the eyes , especially the scars after laser treatments and  it does not improve blemishes at all.  It is not suitable for sensitive skin. It is the worst product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Use this everyday. Nice tint. Not dry or oily.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, great foundation instead of lotion after cleaning. Like myself with ache, I&#x27;m just used to the old ways before Dermalogica changed its products.</li>
    <li> This product is good if you have sensitive skin, plus it has sun protection. If not I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love Dermalogica products.  Tis is a moisturizer with a physical sunblock... Zink.  And it&#x27;s tinted which hides the pinkness in my skin.  I&#x27;m 47 and don&#x27;t need make up with this, just a little powder!</li>
    <li> Much heavier product than the Dermalogica Ultra Sensitive SPF 25 of the past - I preferred the old product to this new one</li>
    <li> Love Dermalogica in general and recommend this product. I have rosacea and this is moisturizing while at the same time the tint tones down my redness.</li>
    <li> 5 stars.  I use this as my foundation. I like the faint scent too. I don&#x27;t use this every day because I have ulta sensitive skin, but it causes me no harm when I do wear it.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product for years and love it. Not sure if it is the vendor I bought from this time but the product is going to expire 5-6 mos after I bought it, that seems weird to me and it seems more separated out &amp; oily. Will not buy from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I am currently 38yrs old, and have combination / oily skin. I have been using this tinted sunscreen as my daily sunscreen AND foundation for over 8 years.  I like that this has good sheer-type coverage, doesn&#x27;t shine, doesn&#x27;t clog pores and doesn&#x27;t run off my face.</li>
    <li> Great as sunscreen, not so great as foundation for OLIVE COMPLEXION people like me.  but if you fluff your face with a bronzer, that&#x27;ll work, too.</li>

    <li> I use it as a base for my make up.  It&#x27;s heavy &amp; light enough to cover all the skin splotches.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this on vacation and loved it.  When I needed more I ordered online and the product wasn&#x27;t as fresh and smooth as the first tube I purchased in person.</li>
    <li> I like that this lotion protects me from the sun &amp; gives me some color as well.  I receive compliments quite often about my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product because of its creamy texture, the slight coloring and - last not least - the SPF 30. I would use the Dermalogica Ultra sensitive tint time and again.  To leave the house without its protection is unthinkable.</li>

    <li> This tinted sunscreen is excellent for my type of usage. I mix it with another sunscreen to create a light foundation color. It&#x27;s perfect for me - I can apply it and I have my makeup foundation for the day.</li>
    <li> Switched to this product from foundation. Not as heavy and works as both, moisturizer and light foundation. Doesn&#x27;t plug my pores unlike many products. Love it!.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff I use it instead of foundation it gives a nice light coverage but great sunblock protection.  It&#x27;s got a tint to it but it&#x27;s still somewhat transparent so you&#x27;re not getting a heavy coverage I still sometimes have to use a little coverup if I have breakouts.</li>
    <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my face. This is the only sunscreen that does not irritate my skin. (I have tried almost every product you can think of.) It&#x27;s hard to find a sunscreen that is Titanium Dioxide only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice &amp; light, the light color/tint is great for evening out skin tone, does not streak, stay on well in pool &amp; ocean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Titanium Dioxide, Butylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Neopentyl Glycol Diethylhexanoate, Arachidyl Alcohol, PEG-10 Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Behenyl Alcohol, Leuconostoc/Radish Root Ferment Filtrate, Stearyl Dimethicone, Potassium Cetyl Phosphate, Extracts of: Camellia Oleifera Leaf, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel, Boerhavia Diffusa Root, Melissa Officinalis, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed, Citrus Medica Limonum (Lemon) Peel, Centella Asiatica, Echinacea Purpurea, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root; Oils of: Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender), Thymus Vulgaris (Thyme), Pelargonium Graveolens, Aniba Rosaeodora (Rosewood) Wood, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange); Bisabolol, Tocopherol, Lecithin, Panthenol, Sodium Lactate, Sodium PCA, Sorbitol, Proline, Pentylene Glycol, Hydroxyphenyl Propamidobenzoic Acid, Glycerin, Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Silica, Arachidyl Glucoside, Cetearyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Sodium DNA, Ascorbyl Tetraisopalmitate, Neopentyl Glycol Diisostearate, Alumina, Methicone, Stearic Acid, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxy Stearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Diiostearate, Xanthan Gum, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Hydroxide, Limonene, Linalool, Geraniol, Citronellol, Coumarin, Iron Oxides (77491, 77492, 77499).</li>
