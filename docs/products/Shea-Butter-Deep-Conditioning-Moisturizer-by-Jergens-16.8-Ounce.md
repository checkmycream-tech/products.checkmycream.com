      <li>I have been using this on my pregnant belly twice a day</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly &amp; was exactly what she wanted, so now I can add it my my \\&quot;Subscibe &amp; Save\\&quot; items &amp; we&#x27;ll never run out!</li>
      <li>wow, this lotion is smooth, rich and once you put it on, you feel the emollients working to make your hands feel light and healed.  </li>
      <li>and it goes into your skin leaving it soft and smooth and glossy so fabulous</li>
      <li>This is a good staple to have around the house for when your dry skin needs a good heavy moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint, but pleasant and lovely fragrance, which is great if you are sensitive to smells or live and work with people who are.</li>
      <li>Jergens is a good brand and you cant mess that up .</li>
      <li>so I order 2 bottles and the first day I put the lotion on my skin</li>

      <li>Thanks.</li>

      <li>and she was talking about how she uses it every day it really moisturize her skin</li>
      <li>Not only is it great to keep you protected from harsh elements that can dry out your skin, but it is also great for everyday use.</li>
      <li>I love using this product and would recommend it to family and friends, it make life with dry hands soft again.</li>
      <li>I attempted to hoard the older version via Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else, but like I said before,</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>Its new consistency does feel less creamy and more watery.</li>
      <li>and I was looking for a lotion that was rich and would moisturize my skin because my skin gets really dry in the winter</li>
      <li>All in all it is thick and great for dry skin-</li>
      <li>When I bought this new one thinking</li>
      <li>I used it to stave off stretch marks with my first pregnancy, and am using it again with my second.  </li>
      <li>After doing some research I discovered Jergens uses the exact same ingredients in the exact same order 1/8 of the price of L&#x27;Occitane!</li>
      <li>it was just new packaging at the time (going from \\&quot;Penetrates &amp; Transforms\\&quot; to \\&quot;Conditions &amp; Enriches,\\&quot; and omitting the \\&quot;Pure African Shea Butter\\&quot; part)</li>
      <li>She insists on having a bottle by her bedside &amp; one next to her bathtub, but I couldn&#x27;t always find this particular lotion in my local stores &amp; I was tired of searching through all the various bottles on the store shelves to find right one, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>As a lifelong user of Bath and Body Works products, I was looking for a lotion that would provide the same intense moisturization, but with less fragrance and at a much better price.</li>
      <li>Finally found this at a decent price.</li>
      <li>This is the only Mosturizer my Mom will use for her dry, \\&quot;senior\\&quot; skin, especially now that she spends most of her year in Montana&#x27;s dry climate.  </li>
      <li>She especially loves the scent, plus the Shea butter really provides deep moisturizing &amp;</li>
      <li>, I noticed they subtly put the cocoa and mango butters lower on the list, and raised the cheaper ones when I was able to compare later.</li>
      <li>Good for cold winter months.</li>
      <li>I am now on the hunt for a different holy grail and brand in general (Kao Brands which I guess owns Jergens doesn&#x27;t respond well to customer feedback, so no thank you).</li>
      <li>Like another person said, finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on a black skin is tedious without being able to test it first.</li>
      <li>This lotion is very moisturizing and a little goes along way.</li>

<li> This definitely worked though, and it gives that same shea butter glow and moisture that the raw shea butter does.</li>

<li> I looked and tried other shea butter lotions</li>

<li> bottle of BBW lotion for $11, you&#x27;re getting 2.5x the product for around 30% less!</li>
<li> Stretch your expensive lotion a little further!</li>
<li> pump bottle is usually around $8 or less, and it lasts for at least a couple months!</li>
<li> My skin suffers with the dry air but this moisturizing lotion is just the ticket!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Jergens shea moisturizer is the thickest, most moisturizing (and best smelling!) cream I&#x27;ve found on the market.  I used it to stave off stretch marks with my first pregnancy, and am using it again with my second.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I looked and tried other shea butter lotions but this one is great. The container is bigger than I thought it would be. I will last a long time. I&#x27;ll purchase these again.</li>
    <li> I have used Jergens before many years ago I&#x27;m always changing my lotion I order this lotion because I was watching Queen latifah show and she was talking about how she uses it every day it really moisturize her skin and I was looking for a lotion that was rich and would moisturize my skin because my skin gets really dry in the winter so I order 2 bottles and the first day I put the lotion on my skin it was amazing its thick and rich and smells so good and it goes into your skin leaving it soft and smooth and glossy so fabulous and it&#x27;s not greasy at all this is the best Jergens lotion so far.</li>
    <li> I had really dry skin so I decided to try the deep conditioning moistuiser to apply to my legs at night after I take a shower. While it may have softened my legs some it makes my legs feel sticky hours after aplying the lotion. I can&#x27;t get to sleep at night because I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of the sheets clinging to my legs.</li>
    <li> This is a big bottle and lasts awhile. This lotion is very moisturizing and a little goes along way. I think it works just as well if not better than some higher end lotions I have tried. This is a good staple to have around the house for when your dry skin needs a good heavy moisturizer.  If your looking for a lightweight lotion this is not it, this is very thick and really helps with dry skin.</li>
    <li> I used to use a jar of 100 percent raw organic shea butter, and it worked really well. It gave this natural glow to my dark skin, but was too thick, and mixing it with olive oil or coconut oil was such a hassle. Like another person said, finding a lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on a black skin is tedious without being able to test it first. This definitely worked though, and it gives that same shea butter glow and moisture that the raw shea butter does. Would def recommend it, especially for those of african descent.</li>
    <li> I always used this product as it works great on my skin. Finally found this at a decent price. Worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Occitane&#x27;s Shea Butter Hand Cream for years ([...] After doing some research I discovered Jergens uses the exact same ingredients in the exact same order 1/8 of the price of L&#x27;Occitane! I&#x27;m a Jergens girl for life now!</li>
    <li> Great lotion and smooth on skin for all types.Has a light aroma that stays on skin all day.People should try it</li>
    <li> The Shea butter give it a bit of a strong odor compared to most lotions, but it&#x27;s perfect for dry hands and feet where the butter gives your skin a good shine.</li>
    <li> The product is good for dry skin and gives a nice sheen. Good for cold winter months. The only con is the smell. I really cannot stand it. But other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> My baby girl has very dry skin. I love this stuff..it smells great and it leaves her skin so soft..</li>
    <li> This is my new fav as i wanted something special and this cream is it buy this we all use it.</li>
    <li> My mom loved this cream. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Nourishing Lotion with a great smell. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. Great lotion and good price.</li>
    <li> Great lotion. Not only is it great to keep you protected from harsh elements that can dry out your skin, but it is also great for everyday use. I have been using this on my pregnant belly twice a day and it is working wonders for the itchy feeling I was having and it is keeping at bay stretch marks. I would highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> I tried this moisturizer because it contains some of the key ingredients of another moisturizer I used before but was discontinued. I absolutely love it! Skin looks silky and healthy. I got my husband and daughter using it now!</li>
    <li> This is the only Mosturizer my Mom will use for her dry, \\&quot;senior\\&quot; skin, especially now that she spends most of her year in Montana&#x27;s dry climate.  She especially loves the scent, plus the Shea butter really provides deep moisturizing &amp; the pump dispenser is so easy for her to use. She insists on having a bottle by her bedside &amp; one next to her bathtub, but I couldn&#x27;t always find this particular lotion in my local stores &amp; I was tired of searching through all the various bottles on the store shelves to find right one, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It arrived quickly &amp; was exactly what she wanted, so now I can add it my my \\&quot;Subscibe &amp; Save\\&quot; items &amp; we&#x27;ll never run out!</li>
    <li> As a lifelong user of Bath and Body Works products, I was looking for a lotion that would provide the same intense moisturization, but with less fragrance and at a much better price. Jergens Shea Butter lotion fits the bill perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint, but pleasant and lovely fragrance, which is great if you are sensitive to smells or live and work with people who are. Sometimes BBW stuff is so overpowering, you know? It is very creamy, NOT greasy at all, and lasts all day! I even use it to moisturize my face because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is the price: the large 21 oz. pump bottle is usually around $8 or less, and it lasts for at least a couple months! Compared to an 8 oz. bottle of BBW lotion for $11, you&#x27;re getting 2.5x the product for around 30% less! You can even do what I do: put a squirt of Jergens and a squirt of BBW and apply them together. Stretch your expensive lotion a little further!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as good as I hoped.</li>
    <li> I love using this product and would recommend it to family and friends, it make life with dry hands soft again.</li>
    <li> wow, this lotion is smooth, rich and once you put it on, you feel the emollients working to make your hands feel light and healed.  Great lotion for the fall and winter days.</li>
    <li> It not to thick or thin and it keeps my skin moisturize for a complete day.  It has a very soft scent and a nice price.</li>
    <li> Did not like at all. Made skin break out in bumps. Must be the Shea butter. Like most Jergens lotions, just not this one.</li>
    <li> Smells good and very moisturising.</li>
    <li> This lotion is exactly what I need for winter in my area. My skin suffers with the dry air but this moisturizing lotion is just the ticket! The scent if light and pleasant. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I tend to not like lotions because they can be greasy but this lotion is great, very moisturizing because of the shea butter and not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> Jergens is a good brand and you cant mess that up . All in all it is thick and great for dry skin- it also last a while</li>
    <li> **I posted another Jergens Shea Butter review on the larger version, so apologies if this feels like a repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I&#x27;m not certain if Amazon will update the page information (I contacted them), but Jergens changed their formula of this lotion. And despite what is pictured and advertised, this is the newer version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Jergens brand since I was a kid and this lotion was my favorite. It had great ingredients for the price. I loved how hydrating and creamy it was, while also never feeling greasy. Oh, and I thought the smell was heavenly! Now they changed the formula and it does feel and smell different. I am beyond bummed out. I didn&#x27;t realize they changed it until now, since I tended to buy two or three of the larger ones at a time when they&#x27;re on sale, and they last forever. When I bought this new one thinking it was just new packaging at the time (going from \\&quot;Penetrates &amp; Transforms\\&quot; to \\&quot;Conditions &amp; Enriches,\\&quot; and omitting the \\&quot;Pure African Shea Butter\\&quot; part), I noticed they subtly put the cocoa and mango butters lower on the list, and raised the cheaper ones when I was able to compare later. Its new consistency does feel less creamy and more watery. Not by a gigantic fraction, to be fair, but one you notice if you like something enough. It just feels cheaper and the smell isn&#x27;t as great, which is a shame. I attempted to hoard the older version via Amazon when I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else, but like I said before, it&#x27;s actually the newer version and I am disappointed (to an incredibly ridiculous degree). I think I&#x27;m the only person on the planet who cares, yet just in case I thought I&#x27;d let people know. This item isn&#x27;t eligible for a return and I don&#x27;t want you to get stuck with a bunch of lotion you don&#x27;t want, not knowing how Amazon will respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of positives of this lotion that warrant at least a 2.5 stars are: they did at least keep the shea butter up top, it&#x27;s still fairly hydrating, and it&#x27;s not a terrible lotion by any means. It&#x27;s just a subpar version of a once great but cost effective lotion. I am now on the hunt for a different holy grail and brand in general (Kao Brands which I guess owns Jergens doesn&#x27;t respond well to customer feedback, so no thank you).</li>
