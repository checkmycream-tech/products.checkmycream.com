      <li>Gives a nice golden brown color Not orange.</li>
      <li>I have never climbed out of a tanning bed and smelled like roses, so when I read the reviews on any of these lotions, I don&#x27;t put much into the comments that something doesn&#x27;t smell good.  </li>
      <li>and I really liked the golden contrast it gave me.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the product and it smells fantastic, but I would have bumps all over me and would be super itchy!</li>
      <li>smell is important, this is not for you.</li>
      <li>Product is amazing, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot more progress after one day than many other lotions.</li>
      <li>Nothing special to me.</li>
      <li>Make sure to blend in very well or may leave streaks as well.</li>

      <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten good of a tan in a long time.  </li>
      <li>very nice people cant believe how dark my wife and I have gotten.</li>

      <li>Kind of gross.</li>
      <li>I went in somewhat tan, came out golden after 20 min.</li>
      <li>So far so good I have used it 3 times and can already tell a big difference from wat</li>
      <li>This is actually the best tanning lotion I have ever used, not only can it be used in a tanning bed for extreme results, but it is also just as good to use outside on a sunny day!</li>
      <li>After my first use the tanning tech commented on my color as I walked out the door.</li>
      <li>I rotate this with ProTan&#x27;s Seriously Hot</li>
      <li>If it was better protected, I would definitely purchase again</li>
      <li>I have been an avid tanner for years.  </li>

      <li>I enjoy this tanning lotion because it helps keep me dark</li>
      <li>The only set back is that it leaves a stain on your hands unless you wash it off rather quickly.  </li>
      <li>It made me very tan in a very short period.</li>
      <li>Worked well for the price, The smell was decent, it took a few times of tanning to actually notice the true color.</li>
      <li>It is harder for me to tan as I get older.</li>

    <li> it&#x27;s okay, it goes on a little thick, i really don&#x27;t notice being any darker by using this lotion. it smells good. i won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Worked great loved it</li>
    <li> i got very dark very fsat with this, i only tan once  or twice a week but with this lotion it s a deep dark tan and i dont fade</li>
    <li> Average quality, got average color from this.  Smells okay.</li>
    <li> This is great for a starter tan but not for keeping the dark glow</li>
    <li> Great product. This is the cats pajamas!</li>

    <li> love this one it was great the first time i used it and i still love going back to it, gives a great tan, easy to apply and smell great....</li>
    <li> I have been an avid tanner for years.  This product delivers when it comes to bronzer.  The only set back is that it leaves a stain on your hands unless you wash it off rather quickly.  Make sure to blend in very well or may leave streaks as well.</li>
    <li> I like this product it works great. I cant wait to try some other product like this one hear soon.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. I don&#x27;t use lotion most of the time, but i will after this. It is the best bang for you buck! I went in somewhat tan, came out golden after 20 min.</li>
    <li> Shes Brown as a biscuit !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used this brand of tanning lotion before but it is great and I recommend it to anyone that has never used this before and it&#x27;s priced good.</li>
    <li> I like this lotion for the price . It doesn&#x27;t let the tanning bed dry out my skin so it also moiturizes when you use it !</li>
    <li> I enjoy this tanning lotion because it helps keep me dark and I don&#x27;t have to tan every day when i use it. It has not stained my hands from the dark bronzer in the lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It made me very tan in a very short period. It goes on smooth and smells nice. Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Product is amazing, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot more progress after one day than many other lotions. Highly dissatisfied with the way I received it though. The bottle was only put in a basic packing bag with almost no protection, and it was open. So when I opened the package, a quarter of the lotion was inside the bag. If it was better protected, I would definitely purchase again</li>
    <li> I rotate this with ProTan&#x27;s Seriously Hot and I get compliments on my color all the time. The smell isnt bad but I dont see why thats even a factor when purchasing tanning lotion. you want a great lotion for a cheap price then here ya go. Im a bargain shopper who loves her ProTan</li>
    <li> I always use this lotion and love it!!</li>
    <li> This is an AWESOME lotion and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!  Have always had great success with the silicone-based lotions and all of my clients who use this product agree that it works REALLY WELL.  Because of the price point, I think some people are skeptical, but trust me .. it works!  And the color you get is beautiful!</li>
    <li> So far so good I have used it 3 times and can already tell a big difference from wat I was using</li>
    <li> I used this for tanning for prom. It is one of the best lotions I have ever used! It gives a you a great brown tan! I&#x27;ve only had to lay a few times to get a nice tan! I would highly reccomend this tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> Perfect except leaves a orange / yellow tink to ur hands after applying it; Other than that fully satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Bronzer stays on even and lasts long time.  Been using bronzers for years and this is the best one I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Good quality product for price</li>
    <li> We are very satisfied with the results of this product.Our tan is very nice people cant believe how dark my wife and I have gotten.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and was worried I would not like it but once i got it i loved it (&#x3D;</li>
    <li> Great quality!  I have never climbed out of a tanning bed and smelled like roses, so when I read the reviews on any of these lotions, I don&#x27;t put much into the comments that something doesn&#x27;t smell good.  It&#x27;s a good product, period.</li>
    <li> Works great and excellent price too!</li>
    <li> I got a faster very nice golden tan with this lotion. I didnt give five starts because I felt It smell nice in the bottle and then little like burn after a tanning session. I would still using again thought, its better than other lotions I used and I really liked the golden contrast it gave me.</li>
    <li> It was alright. Nothing special to me. The smell is very bad. If your looking for something that smells good then keep looking.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten good of a tan in a long time.  Love the smell also.  I use it with other pro Tan products as well.  Great product!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion I have ever used. I have been tanning for over forty years on and off. It is harder for me to tan as I get older. I was so pleasantly surprised after I used the 2012 Pro Tan Unbelievably Black Extreme 25x Ultra Bronzing Tanning Lotion. I rubbed it on and got under my tanning bed and came out a beautiful bronze color. I was very impressed. I just ordered three more bottles. The only con is that I wish the lotion came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion for both indoor and out door tanning. Gives a nice golden brown color Not orange. Will be Ordering again</li>
    <li> I recieved this in a timely manner. But when I opened the pkg it came in, the lotion was opened and had leaked out all in the wrapper so I ended up with half a bottle. Not happy about it at all....</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird but works well</li>
    <li> One of the most amazing products. Works like a charm and will continue to order it. It has met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Worked well for the price, The smell was decent, it took a few times of tanning to actually notice the true color.</li>
    <li> This is actually the best tanning lotion I have ever used, not only can it be used in a tanning bed for extreme results, but it is also just as good to use outside on a sunny day! Price is amazing as well to buy this in one of our tanning salons they are charging around $75! That&#x27;s crazy!</li>
    <li> This is a very dark bronzer, which I like.  The smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant...  It almost smells like it has no perfume in it at all.  In the bed the smells gets stronger. It doesn&#x27;t bother me but I read alot of reviews about smells, so I thought I would be it out there.  The lotion is thick and has to be rubbed in.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something to get you darker after one or two applications, this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;If smell is important, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> This product brings an instant bronze to your tanning session and the smell is great!  After my first use the tanning tech commented on my color as I walked out the door. Yea!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the product and it smells fantastic, but I would have bumps all over me and would be super itchy! I ended up having to take Benadryl for it every time I used it! Almost like I was allergic to it. I purchased something else and i never had an issue. I would recommend this to others but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
    <li> Tested this product prior to purchasing it on Amazon...it&#x27;s a great dark bronzing lotion without turning my skin orange. The only problem that I&#x27;ve found is the smell, I smell like a tanning bed even before hopping into the booth. I do love the color it&#x27;s given me though</li>
    <li> Well, twenty words is about all I&#x27;ll need to review this lackluster product. Since I wasn&#x27;t well acquainted with the ratings of bronzers (50X, 100X, etc) I bought two difference levels: This, along with another 100X. Point blank, I could EASILY tell a vast difference! Do yourself a favor, avoid the aggravation of seeing snail-paced tanning progress, and spend another dollar or two, literally, and go for the gusto with a darker higher quality tanning lotion!</li>
    <li> This is the Best tan lotion ever!! ... I plan to order more soon!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone who wants to stay golden all year long!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this tanning lotion for about 2 years now and I love it. It&#x27;s not overpriced and gets me tan fairly quick. I decided to order it on here because it was about 20$ cheaper than what I normally pay in my salon. Although it arrived sooner than I expected, when I received the lotion, the cap was off and lotion had exploded into the package. The lid apparently hadn&#x27;t been screwed on correctly and the seller had only placed a small piece of Scotch tape over the lid. The tanning lotion itself is great and worth buying but I didn&#x27;t like that half of the bottle was emptied into the package before I even got it.</li>
