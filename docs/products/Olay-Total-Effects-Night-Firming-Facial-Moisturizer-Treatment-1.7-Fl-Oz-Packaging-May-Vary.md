<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Smells pretty good and is thick but not greasy. I think it all do the job!</li>
    <li> Splendid, my face loves it, just getting to the bottom of the jar.  I have actually mixed a little of my makeup with it (it is a cream formation) and it goes on so smoothly and great for the wrinkles - of course I don&#x27;t have any - really a great product, well it is &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; going to tell my kids to get me a jar each for Mother&#x27;s Day.  lol  Simone, Milford, Ct.</li>
    <li> as advertised, thank you!</li>
    <li> As some others have indicated, my skin broke out when using this product.  I have a combination, t-zone complection.  I gather that it is too rich for my skin type.</li>
    <li> wife loves it we are gonna order more i would recomend this product to any women who wants soft skin and wrinkle free</li>
    <li> I love Olay total effects. I use it every night. I am 74 years old  and I get a lot of compliments about my face skin texture.</li>
    <li> Suddenly I feel and look younger!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!! I have mature skin and this really adds a lot of moisture which helps a lot. It goes on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> It moisturized my face but that is about it!&lt;br /&gt;I did not expect 10 years to be lifted off my face but I thought it would at least tone. If I wanted to just moisture my face, I will stick the a lotion. Smells good though!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about half way through the jar. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in moisture and softness as well as a slight improvement to my laugh lines under my eyes and around my mouth. I don&#x27;t know if this is a typical result.  I&#x27;m happy so far - let&#x27;s see what the rest of the jar holds in store! I&#x27;m also so pleased that Amazon offers this product at such a great price with Subscribe and Save along with my Amazon Prime membership!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and I notice a difference on my neck. It&#x27;s smoother and less lines. It&#x27;s taking longer on my face but I&#x27;m noticing a difference-lines are less noticeable. I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. Good cream!!</li>
    <li> This is nice, it has kind of a strong smell (it doesn&#x27;t bother me, it smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;), and it moisturized great</li>
    <li> This cream is really fantastic. Lightweight, no smell I can detect. I&#x27;ve been using it at night and a little bit in the morning as well. A little goes a long way! After just a few days, the dark circles under my eyes have almost disappeared and the fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable. They may be less noticeable because the circles under my eyes are less noticeable, I&#x27;m not sure. But either way this cream has been a great purchase and I will definitely buy it again. I love it because I hate wearing make up and it allows me to look more refreshed and less tired without having to put on concealer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t explain how amazing this cream really is! It&#x27;s literally magic in a bottle! I&#x27;m a 20 year old girl, who suffers from dry skin, and I&#x27;ve been using Pond&#x27;s cream for years, and my skin is still dry and tried other products like garnier creams and would break out really bad! I was kind of scared to try out this cream because its specifically designed for anti-aging but reading some of the reviews that also suffer from dryness, I took the risk and ordered it anyways! and oh my gosh, after applying it on my face I can already feel it working! It&#x27;s not too heavy but it absorbs right away! I&#x27;ve been having such soft skin that I never had before!!! I just LOVE this cream!! I  also use it with the Olay active hydrating cream, and my skin has never been soft like this!! No regrets! I just love it! I have only been using this cream for 2 weeks, and already I can notice a huge difference and get compliments on how great my skin looks!! LOVE OLAY!!!</li>
    <li> I used to like this cream because it is a good moisturizer. I liked how my face felt after I put it on. But I can not attest to its firming capabilities.</li>
    <li> This product works miracles. I used estee lauder or lancome or clinique before and decided to be a bit careful with money. This product works as equal to any of the above products, the jar lasts for a longer time with 1/4 of the price!! Would recommend highly to anyone.</li>
    <li> I rarely find skin products that you can really tell are working, but Olay Total Effects makes my skin look healthier after only a few days of use.  It&#x27;s worth the price for sure.</li>
    <li> I use only Oil of Olay skin care products and I really like this night cream. It is very moisturizing without feeling greasy. I use the Total Effects cleanser and daytime lotion too and see a noticable difference in my skin! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Can I just say that I love all Olay products?  They are great.  While they can be pricey they are definitely worth the money.  I have been using this product for 6 days and can see some of the fine lines diminishing and my skin is very soft.  No sensitivity and no breakouts have occurred.  I can see using this product forever.</li>
    <li> My favourite moisturiser!! I&#x27;ve used it for ten years and I swear by it. Better than some of the really expensive brands I&#x27;ve used</li>
    <li> I have been buying this from amazon for my wife and she seems to love it.  I even signed up for the subscribe and save option (never thought I would be doing that.  It generally doesn&#x27;t smell much and I really like that it doesn&#x27;t mess up the bed.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I used this night cream along with their day cream.    problem:  I&#x27;m a 65 yo male that has always had a ruddy complexion. I wore a cervical neck collar for about 6 years, plus losing about 100 pounds about 2 years ago. My neck was an over abundance of loose saggy skin. I just wiped it on w/o paying much attention to how I did it.    RESULT after 1 month:  Nearly all my saggy neck skin has tightened. It unbelievable.  plus-  I&#x27;ve received comments from three different people who commented, \\&quot;you look great - what have you done to your face and neck!\\&quot; THAT SAYS IT ALL&gt;    I&#x27;ll definitely reorder these two products.</li>
    <li> With in the few days i felt difference in my face, it really helps firm .</li>
    <li> got it as a gift and very well liked. I guess its working as intended.</li>
    <li> Works better than some of the more expensive creams.</li>
    <li> Works well...my skin is usually rough from the day when I put the cream on at night.  Overnight, my skin heals. It&#x27;s great. The only annoying part is that it doesn&#x27;t really \\&quot;soak\\&quot; into my skin.  When I shower in the morning, I feel the cream sticky on my face. No big deal though..still a good product</li>
    <li> There are so many different Olay products in their Regenerist line, that it makes it confusing to be able to narrow it down.  I guess the only way is trial-and-error.  For this particular product (despite 5 star reviews from many customers), it didn&#x27;t perform in a way that will persuade me to purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Thick cream (a little goes a long way)&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- Fast absorbing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not perform as advertised (firming aspect, but not that my age demographic of 30-35 needs it)&lt;br /&gt;- after 2 months of use, have not noticed any improvement in fine lines with sole use of this product (I am starting to develop my first fine line just under the eye area)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What actually has worked in the past was the Neutrogena night cream with Retinol--but I don&#x27;t like to use that every day because I don&#x27;t want to become too dependent on Retinol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really like the Olay Night Cream (for some reason, has a pale lavendar color).  That must be a new product, because they&#x27;re selling it as a free trial product shrinkwrapped to the Regenerist daily serum and Regenerist eye serum packages in stores.</li>
    <li> Olay is always good product for money. But this night cream is runny in comparison with other night cream I used to use. It feels like My skin doesn&#x27;t keep the moisture as much as before with cream that is not runny/watery.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this Olay product. I have only been using it for about a month, but with In that short amount of time my skin &amp; over all appearance Is very hydrated, firm, &amp; smooth. I am very impressed also with the fact that my skin actually looks more even In tone &amp; has given me a new found confidence so I feel comfortable even without foundation on. This night cream seems to give my face a healthy glow &amp; a little goes a long way.  I put this on my face &amp; neck every night &amp; love waking up to beautiful soft skin!! Highly recommend this product, &amp; for the quality in my opinion the price is fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to see if the firming claim is valid; however, my 55 year old skin does feel moisturized, not greasy, very smooth. It&#x27;s a very rich feeling cream as you put it on. The fragrance is appealing and not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> All of these products are great will buy again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00006JT6O Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face &amp; Neck - 1.7 fl oz]]  I have used this product for years and firmly believe!</li>
    <li> Use at night face is good to look at in the morning</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth.  The shipping cost took away from the discount of the item.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell that this product has improved my skin. It does not feel smooth and creamy when it is applied.</li>
    <li> Nice cream. I love all OLAY products.</li>
    <li> I will say this is only a good moisturizer cream.  I was looking for firming around the chin area but no visible firming so far.</li>
    <li> I read some good reviews and decided to try this cream.  I am in my mid-50&#x27;s and am always looking for inexpensive, natural ways to \\&quot;age gracefully.\\&quot;  This cream has a pleasant scent and is very creamy and smooth.  A little goes a long way, and it feels nice on my face and neck.  It also seems to give me a fresher, smoother face and neck when I get up in the morning.  At my age, nothing natural works miracles, but I do recommend this cream.  It is as good a product as you&#x27;ll find for gentle firming and smoothing wrinkles. It is relatively inexpensive, and I plan to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I have good skin. Not acne prone, but i still have some acne scars, and discoloration. when i use this, it makes my face very soft, but at times it stings. (I guess i have sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen an improvement, but it moisturizes real well.</li>
    <li> This may work for some but not for me so I am still searching. for a moisturizer that will work for my skin.</li>
    <li> Not sure if I look younger, but my face feels so smooth after using this for a few weeks!</li>
    <li> I think this product is a very nice consistency and smells wonderful. Very moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t leave me super oily when I wake up. All around it&#x27;s a great face cream.</li>
    <li> I like the smell of it , i tried it today . i will use it more time to check the effects. l like it now</li>
    <li> I am 41 years old and this product worked.  I waited to write a review after using 3 weeks, but I noticed a difference after the first week.  The skin on my neck is more even toned, less red and in better condition.  I recommend this product if you are older.  If you are younger then I suggest using sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This cream works well on dry skin. It moisturizes well. My t-zone is a bit more oily, but I haven&#x27;t seen any issues with this product.  I&#x27;ve tried other producs that make me breakout, but this cream did not. I&#x27;m enjoying it so far. My goals are to minimize wrinkles and get a good night moisturizer. Still early to see a difference on the wrinkles but I like the moisture it provides.</li>
    <li> Love the way this lotion makes my skin feel. I&#x27;ve tried many brands but I consider this one the best.</li>
    <li> So I have normal/dry skin and I usually opt for heavy moisturizers to get that rich, \\&quot;moisturized\\&quot; feeling, but that&#x27;s just the problem; they&#x27;re usually too oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With olay products it&#x27;s either hit or miss for me, and this night cream is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so smooth and luxurious going on my face and at the same time it&#x27;s light and refreshing. I wake up in the morning and my skin tone is noticeably more even and my skin is nice and smooth and plump (I&#x27;m 23, so don&#x27;t really have an issue with lines or wrinkles just yet *cross my fingers*).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously. One of the more affordable products out there that works wonders.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a very good cream that didn&#x27;t leave me greasy.  It seemed to really soften my skin but I&#x27;m not sure it did anything for the wrinkles.</li>
    <li> this cream is so smooth and feels wonderfully light and airy on your face, love it&lt;br /&gt;my skin feels smoother and tighter</li>
    <li> works well as all olay product do</li>
    <li> I gave it four stars instead of three because I really don&#x27;t use it *every* *day* ...I switch between olay&#x27;s regenerist micro sculpting cream and this.&lt;br /&gt;It does firm the face but I don&#x27;t like how greasy it makes me feel in the morning. It smells pleasant though and it does do what it is supposed to do so I will continue to use it while on my quest to find a lighter firming moisturizer :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream for almost 2 yrs and love it.</li>
    <li> this has a wonderful feel to it, i like the texture not much difference from other night creams that i can tell yet.</li>
    <li> So I spent almost an hour reading through reviews for this cream as I am 32 and starting preventative skin care regime. Many reviews mentioned the smell and while it does have a perfume smell, it&#x27;s not horrible. I read that some people broke out but I said, not all people are alike. Finally, I bit the bullet and purchased. After the 2nd day my skin broke out BAD. Pimples every where! I wanted to like this product, so I initially thought, maybe my period is coming...nope. I thought, maybe more water. Nope. It was the cream. After a full week, I looked like I was 16 and in a Proactive commercial. I finally stopped using it and just used my day time face lotion and pimples be gone.</li>
    <li> Seems to do what it says, as long as you remember to use it every night.</li>
    <li> I like how this product diminshied all my wrinkles, lines, and my uneven skin tone but it did NOTHING to firm my skin and it was too greasy. I put this moisturizer before I sleep and when I woke up in the morning , there&#x27;s oil  and shine ALL OVER my face. I was competeley grossed out and was quite dissapointed. Not recommened for people with oily skin.</li>
    <li> Product ordered was the product delivered. This is product I use on a regular basis on my face, so I received what I wanted and needed, therefore my rating is on the service provided by HBC Depot, which was simply \\&quot;Ok\\&quot;. There was nothing extraordinary or special required of HBC Depot other than simply taking product from their shelf, packaging it and mailing it.  HBC Depot is not the manuafacturer of the product, just simply a supplier of the product.  The \\&quot;Olay Total Effects\\&quot; product line I am extremely pleased with.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a short time, but so far I really like the feel of the product.  It is not greasy and my skin feels and looks healthier.  It definitely helps with the summer dryness.</li>
    <li> Fist time I have used this and I really like it. I have dry skin and this is great! Will buy again</li>
    <li> Non greasy and use it every night. Eventually found it cheaper in stores, but it is getting harder to find.</li>
    <li> I love oil of Olay, my mother and grandmother have always used these products, and they look great! I think they smell fabulousness and my skin feels so smooth when using the products, I buy this brand for my toner, eyes, night and day cream!! Love them</li>
    <li> this is a little more watery than I like my night cream to be, but all and all it works well, at least to moisturize my face at the end of the day</li>
    <li> I alway&#x27;s use olay products.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought I needed a heavier night cream, but its a little too heavy for my face as I have oily/combination skin.  If you are dry/combination or dry and need that extra moisture, this would be an excellent product for you.  I use it on my neck only and it works wonders for that, but when I use it on my face, I have a few whiteheads in the morning.  Still a good product as most of the Olay line has proven to be.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the reviews but felt it was too heavy and greasy. I then switched to First Aid Beauty ultra repair and for the money this is a better buy and I had better results. I have oily skin and tend to break out with heavy creams which I think Olay is.</li>
    <li> on my skin. I have found the Olay products to be the best for my skin and within my price range. I love the Olay regenerist line and grabbed this one by mistake, but I was not disappointed. This one is a little thicker and works just as well.</li>
    <li> I had used this stuff a few years back and well buying it from the local store was a bit pricey for I am a mother that does not like to spend money on myself so I just stopped buying it............until now I found it here subscribe and save DOES save lots of money you cannot get it that cheap using coupons! Anyway I forgot how much I LOVED the feeling of applying this stuff to my face. It is so luxurious, thick and creamy not greasy at all! I use it night and day time under my makeup. I just love it! :o)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all of the Olay facial products and this is one of my personal favorites, especially because of the light scent (my husband has not complained about this one when we go to bed). I have normal-to-oily skin, so I have to make sure to use the right products that won&#x27;t clog my pores. The cream seems to absorb well into my skin, so it does not feel greasy or thick. The price is affordable, especially on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe-and-Save Program, where you can set it up for 1-6 month automatic purchases at 15% discount and cancel at anytime without penalty. Sometimes I wish that it came in a pump-style (like it&#x27;s sister products) instead of a jar, so that I can control the amount. I&#x27;m still on my first jar after 5 months BUT I do rotate in between products. Therefore, I gave it only 4 stars because I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen much of a difference on my skin though... Regardless, I would recommend this product to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for some time now and really like the way it makes my face feel as well as the price.  I&#x27;ve tried various creams and this one I feel I can notice a difference.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Have used it for years.</li>
    <li> This is my new go to night cream. I think it firms my skin and evens my skin tone. I am 25 and just now falling I love with my skin and this product adds the extra boost to add radiance. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Have used this product over 20 years.  Love the texture, smell, and the way it makes my skin feel.  I spend alot of time in the sun, and feel that nightly use of this product has kept my skin looking &amp; feeling good.!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, Olay is one of the best beauty products line and for a lot less than some of the $100 and up department store and dermatologist prescribed products.  I use this along with deep wrinkle treatment for under eyes every night and love the dewy feel, firming and evening out of complexion.  I have used Olay for many years now and people are often surprised when I mention my chronological age, because the estimate it to be 10+ years less.  Thank you Olay!</li>
    <li> I live in a high altitude, very dry environment.  I have dry skin, so I use this creme during the day.  Works great!  Keeps my skin moist.  Not much works here in this climate.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It takes away the glow and fairness in the skin. Gives you a dull look. I did not find it all that great.</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment is ok. Not quite the moisturizer I needed - it felt good going on but didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
    <li> Being 50, I want to take extra good care of my skin and face. I&#x27;m a fan of Olay products and have been for many years. Unfortunately, the highly-rated Regenerist line gave me a headache due to whatever fragrance or chemicals used. (I&#x27;m not saying Regenerist isn&#x27;t a great product, just that I couldn&#x27;t use it.)  Based on other reviews, I tried this one. Happily, it does not cause any sensitivity or irritation and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month. A little goes a long way. This size will probably last you almost two months. It has a great consistency and leaves my skin feeling really soft and well-moisturized. It&#x27;s nice to be able to use it on both my face and neck and I am starting to see overall improvement in tone and firmness.</li>
    <li> First of all I am in my early 20&#x27;s so I haven&#x27;t much experience in night creams.  I just more recently took an interest in moisturizers and eye creams after I decided to quit tanning and rather preserve my youthfulness.  I use \\&quot;moisture therapy cream\\&quot; by Olay in the morning before I put on my makeup, and then I use this at night.  My skin always feels so soft, more soft than I think it ever did.  I can&#x27;t give any testaments on its firming or anti-wrinkle ability, but I can say it does make my skin glow and my complexion look healthier.  The scent is great and it is a great smell to fall asleep to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone of any age.  It has a good price compared to everything else on the market and I believe it is best to start moisturizing when you are young rather than waiting until the signs of aging have already begun.  Prevention is key!</li>
    <li> This seems to even out skin tone and improve worry line on forhead.</li>
    <li> I got this Olay 7 and been using it for some weeks.  I have noticed the firmness around my face and neck.  Also, to note it was packaged well no leakage.  My face it very soft and looks firm and toned I also bought the eye treatment which in combination giving a much younger appearance.</li>
    <li> It seems to do what it claims.  It refreshes the skin and gives you a glow.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used product for 6 weeks.  The box that it is packaged in is at least two times the size of the small jar that&#x27;s inside.  I am in my early forties and have crows feet on the sides of my eyes and furrow lines across my forehead.  I also have brown spots.  This product has not reduced my wrinkles and has not diminished the brown spots, so it does not do what I was hoping it would.</li>
    <li> Yes, love this cream.  Not oil but moisturize my skin.  Will re-order again.</li>
    <li> Love it. Keeps face moisturized</li>
    <li> i bought this product after reviewing all positive feedback from the customers. i put this cream every night before sleep. i didn&#x27;t notice any changes on my face after several days. but what do you expect if you just wore it like for few days right? so i wore this cream continuously and the result is really surprising! after several weeks, i could see my face is much firmer, clearer, and fresh! my friend even asked me why my face is so glowing. i really recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this product last week and try to apply everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel my skin is becoming smooth and brighter than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is AWESOME !!!!</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Last me for quite long too.</li>
    <li> I liked the way that this made my skin feel.  It goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way.  I don&#x27;t believe their claims about it helping with signs of aging, but it feels very nice.  It is a thick, luxurious moisturizer and I&#x27;m sure that there are some benefits to your skin, even if it doesn&#x27;t help with signs of aging . If you are looking for a good moisturizer, this is probably worth a shot!</li>
    <li> Easily the best, cleanest night cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. Leaves my skin soft and moisturized with little residue. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands, none come close.</li>
    <li> I just love this product! It smells so delicious and keeps my skin looking ageless! And it&#x27;s so much cheaper on here than the store!</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite creams.  I love the soft silky feel on my face, and the lightly perfumed scent.  I try to use it sparingly so that I don&#x27;t run out.  My only complaint is that I wish it came in a larger size.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> ESTA CREMA ME DIO ALERGIA</li>
    <li> Nice night cream but too much perfume in it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream on a whim and have to say, after using it for just three weeks, I see (and feel) a difference in my skin.  The lines around my face and mouth seem softer and overall, my complexion is better. Highly recommend for ages 50 plus.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t know, as I haven&#x27;t heard back from her.  But when I do, I will be sure to let you know.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin. This moisturizes without making my skin break out.</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my wife and she is very happy after use of 1 week, she feel different glow on her face and smooth skin.&lt;br /&gt;we highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My second favorite Olay product so far. I was previously using the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream (fragrance-free), and felt like trying another Olay product after I was done with the initial cream. This firming cream feels just as rich as the Micro-sculpting cream. I feel my skin hydrated and smooth every morning. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice a significant change, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> just been using it for few weeks so i can see the result yet..i  would say it feels great the next morning when i use it at night, my face feels soft.</li>
    <li> Love it. Left my face feeling clean. I recommend using this product. Great for day or night time use!!! Sara</li>
    <li> Well dont know yet if im getting any firmness back but my face has never felt better or softer even in am when I get up, face is so soft and smooth. Great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for many years and I have never been dissatisfied with the quality and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> 60 year old male who has discovered the wonders of facial cremes and related care. I had the good fortune to have results within a few weeks after applying daily before bed. A little goes a long way and is not oily, greasy, or a pain in the......Works well in conjunction with other items. Remember there&#x27;s no shame in facial care whatever your sex.  It is important so keep on keeping on chief!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about Olay products.  I figured they spent a lot of money on advertising to get people to believe that their products actually worked.  But I&#x27;m 33 and my skin isn&#x27;t exactly what it used to be so I went in search of some miracle creams.  I read all the reviews and tried Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream out first.  Within a week I felt a noticeable difference in my skin.  It felt smoother and more moisturized.  After two weeks I swore I started seeing a difference.  After a month my skin felt tigher and the blotches were evening out.  I figured all Olay products were similar so I wanted to try something else.  I picked this one and I&#x27;m not as happy with it.  It feels much heavier on my skin.  It has also caused me to break out slightly.  After this one has emptied, I will go back to the Olay Regenerist Perfecting Cream Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream and do the subscribe and save option.  Every two months seems to be the ideal time frame.</li>
    <li> This is really a good product for an inexpensive night cream.  Smells clean too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early twenties so I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in wrinkles or firming effects but this product left my skin smoother and softer. It didn&#x27;t make me breakout or anything. It&#x27;s pretty affordable compare to some of the other night lotion I&#x27;ve used but doesn&#x27;t have any drastic improvement to my skin.</li>
    <li> I especially like the dimethecone in this product. It really softens and fills the lines in my face. Will buy again</li>
    <li> My skin is looking nicer each day I wear it.  It did take a few weeks to see the change.  My fine lines are disapearing and my skin is smooth and glowing.  Also, this product lasts a long time, it does not take much to apply all over your face and neck.</li>
    <li> I fresh feeling when I put this on at night. It does help with the wrinkles because it keeps my skin moist.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not greasy very good product, after a while - I see results (not no  wrinkles, but they are getting much smaller in depth)</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin, which is prone to break outs. Since I have been using this I have seen a reduction in break outs and a more healthy, pinkish glow to my face. I have ever been complemented on my skin looking better. It is not a miracle or anything but it is pretty darn nice for the money. I would say that this is better then Clinque&#x27;s counterpart. I will probably reorder this when I use it all. A little goes a long way. I have read that people with different skin types don&#x27;t have as much sucess with this so be sure to read the other reviews before you purchase.</li>
    <li> My mother and i have been using Olay creams since we were teenagers. We love Olay products. Lovely feeling skin, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. Olay keeps getting better!</li>
    <li> As a 24 year old female, I was looking for a starter anti-aging product to act as prevention for fine lines and firm up my pores a little. Unfortunately, if you already have oily skin, this product is not for you. I used this twice before my face looked like I was back in high school, full of pimples. It seemed to just sit on top of the skin layer and clog my pores. It has a nice, fresh scent and I really wanted to like it, but it&#x27;s just too  moisturizing for me to even test if the rave anti-aging effects are applicable.</li>
    <li> Super smooth and creamy - really revitalizes my dry skin. (age 62)</li>
    <li> I can see the results of using this product it&#x27;s worth the price and would recommend it,Have use other olay products before but this is  better.</li>
    <li> I needed something to help firm my face and neck, so I use this every night and it&#x27;s really working.  Olay has always been a good product.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this.  It seems very watery and my face always felt wet after using it.  I didn&#x27;t see any changes, so given the price, I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought it for a friend. She used it only at night. She told me she really liked it and would like to purchase more.</li>
    <li> An excellent night cream, goes on clean dry face easily and feels good, not heavy or greasy.  Low priced but comparable to many high end products.  This one was a steal.</li>
    <li> Burned all skin on my face I want my money back</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  It&#x27;s nice to pamper yourself a little and it feels great going on.  But results - I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
    <li> I used the lotion for a week now and it has definitely proven it&#x27;s worth.  My skin looks more smooth and healthy. The wrinkles on my forehead haven&#x27;t disappeared but granted I only used it for a week so far. Will definitely update if I see a miracle.</li>
    <li> I´ve been using this cream everynight for about 2 weeks, and i already see a big difference, my skin feels so soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few months now. It feels good on the skin and feels like it is actually working the first couple applications, but time as proven this wrong. The product smells good and lasts awhile, but not any more useful than a face lotion. I used the product every night for three months and I see no change. Maybe it prevents aging and it is to hard to tell in a short period. Not sure I want to keep using it to find out though. I would rather see some results before recommending this product, but I don&#x27;t think this is much more than a regular lotion.</li>
    <li> I really like the face cream.  It smells really nice and goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  Soft skin is the result.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Does it make me look younger? Who knows but it makes my skin feel good. I love Olay products. I buy them here when they are on sale.</li>
    <li> I have been using Olay products for a number of years, and at 67 years of age, I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles on my face, neck, or upper chest. This could, of course, be due to heredity because my 94 year old mother doesn&#x27;t have much in wrinkles either. There is really no way to know for sure, but I do like the feel of this product on my skin. When I use it, my skin feels soft and moisturized, and not greasy as it does with some other products. I will continue to use this and other Olay products.</li>
    <li> So far I have noticed my skin looking more fresh, more vibrant.  I have combination skin so I was hesitant to use this, especially during the summer months.  I do feel like it somewhat melts off my face in the heat and humidity so I have been using it only at night.  I like the smell, it doesn&#x27;t mess my skin up (it&#x27;s sensitive).  My husband says my face feels incredibly soft. ETA:  I cannot use this in the summer..  It clogs my skin and causes massive breakouts.  I have tried using it only in areas where I am dry but when it&#x27;s 110 degrees outside, that might be hard.</li>
    <li> This cream is pleasant to use. It goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t greasy. However, if it has done any firming it isn&#x27;t obvious. As a moisturizer, it works quite well.</li>
    <li> My skin feels amazing when I wake up! Love! And it smells luxurious!</li>
    <li> Good product.Shows Results</li>
    <li> I love how this cream feels. It is the perfect weight for me. It is light but creamy, and it is not greasy at all. I am weary of creams, but not this one. It soothed my skin and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best benefit for me: I&#x27;m very impressed this product addresses seven skin care issues. Most companies will sell you 10 products to get the benefit that you can get in two. I detest piling on layers of skin care products before I go to bed. I usually skip some when that is the case. It becomes a chore. So, if I can address all of these issues in one step - especially for this price - I found a new friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that I don&#x27;t love the smell of this product. It isn&#x27;t a strong smell - just a little bit odd. I only noticed it the first time I used the product, but if that is more important than addressing this many skin care issues by applying one product you won&#x27;t like it very much. That is up to your personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a former professional skin care consultant and make-up artist, and I know the market. I gotta tell ya - Olay has really stepped up their game, research and technology in the past few years. They used to be an okay but passe&#x27; company. Now they are hot on the trail again, making some notable and popular products. They are competing very well again in the market and have without any doubt many of the best products you can get for this price point. Good for them! Who said, older isn&#x27;t better? :*)</li>
    <li> I have only used the cream a few nights so I don&#x27;t expect to see a difference. It is a very thick cream, but not to thick. It does feel nice on the skin. I don&#x27;t care for the smell.  I do prefer a serum .  But if you have really dry skin, you might enjoy this over a serum..</li>
    <li> Nice and thick. Makes my skin feel great but don&#x27;t really see a change in dark spots. Nice scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month.  I really haven&#x27;t seen too much improvement.  Maybe none.  I like Oil of Olay, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t really lift or tighten when you&#x27;re over 50.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t see any amazing results yet, but it has a nice texture and fragrance.</li>
    <li> Too light and not really do anything for my face so I&#x27;m not going to buy again.</li>
    <li> I love the texture &amp; feel of this cream on my face.  And of course, if it helps with the wrinkles I will love it even more.</li>
    <li> Rich and creamy, smells fresh and clean.  Warning...there is a slightly perfume-y taste if you are concerned with lots of kissing at bedtime.  Just my observation.</li>
    <li> Olay is a work in process.  It takes time with this product to bring about results.  The skin appears to be firming/tightening up..  I would purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Yes, I love all my Olay products! At age 69 I have used several other brands to compare but always go back to my Olay the best. I always get many compliments on may complexion and I know it has to be in this product as I do work outside gardening and exposed to sun. I always remember to take pride in using this product last thing at night before going to bed.</li>
    <li> I used it for four weeks and nothing happen.i used it every night and nothing.i just don&#x27;t know.i wish that it had work</li>
    <li> My neck looks smoother since I started using this.  Texture is light, non-greasy.  No scent that I can detect.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I know in order for the Night Firming Treatment to work, you have to be a faithful user!  I will test it for 1 more week</li>
    <li> I am a 50 year old women, and I have been using Olay products for years and love them.  Since I starting using the Night firming cream I can really tell the difference.  It&#x27;s a small improvement but I&#x27;ll take any improvement in the look of my ever increasing wrinkles.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m only 27, but after having my son i could notice signs of aging starting to appear, plus i&#x27;ve always had uneven skin tones. but after using this for a couple weeks my skin looks so much better. i can actually go without make up with worrying about my skin. i have really sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
    <li> I like the way it leaves my skin feel. This has a very light fragrance, and is a good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product and several others were part of a care package to my mother. Thanks to Amazon the store which provided the product to us. I was able to provide my mother the exact products she loves and just in time for Mother&#x27;s day</li>
    <li> works well and smells well</li>
    <li> Everything was as expected</li>
    <li> Some years ago, I saw that an independent testing lab had rated Olay as the most effective at achieving visible results and had bested competing products costing multiple times as much.  I bought some and was very pleased with the results. This Total Effects Night Treatment was a new product that I wanted to try, and it&#x27;s difficult not to sound like a contrived television commercial at how impressed I am.  It&#x27;s nothing short of remarkable how smooth and nourishing it is to my middle age skin, with no irritation or oiliness.  After finishing my first jar and not being able to find it at my local grocery store, I opted for a heavily advertised competing product that they did have. Big mistake and I actually had to return it after just a few days for the disturbing irritation it caused to my skin. Everyone&#x27;s skin, of course, has it&#x27;s own sensitivity and chemistry, but for me at least, I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. It does what it says and at a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used almost all of the jar and my wrinkles dont look any better.  In fact, I think they look  worse.  It does moisturize well but its too expensive for that.</li>
    <li> I like Olay products of all kinds...This one is perfect night cream...No problems what so ever....will use again and have used before</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties, my facial skin always protected at night with a moisturizer. This is one of the best. It is not greasy, and absorbs immediately into my skin, making it feel soft, smooth and silky. It does not irritate, very gentle.</li>
    <li> The night cream has a very smooth texture and leave a silky touch behind.  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before and I will use it again.  My skin feels much softer and firmer than with other products.</li>
    <li> Whatever!  Another non-performing anti-aging. No better than Nivea.</li>
    <li> I have not noticed a change yet.</li>
    <li> Have used for a long time. Love it!  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and this cream keeps my skin nourished and younger looking.</li>
    <li> feel softness right away.  Nice fragrance!</li>
    <li> Wonderful nighttime moisturizer.  Not greasy.  Absorbs easily and leaves skin soft and smooth.  Very happy with the results from use.</li>
    <li> I give it 5 stars,beleive me it has done wonders for me,my face and neck,..en thought for my age I really look very young,I will continue to use Olay work wonders for me!!!</li>
    <li> Works good, no miracles though.</li>
    <li> I  am using now, I am waiting  the effects, but it is soft and the skin feels fresh. It likes good product if I see good effects I will buy soon.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for six weeks and have seen no difference. I am going back to more expensive products that will work better.</li>
    <li> Good buy. Quick shipment.</li>
    <li> Very nice product!!! It gives your skin nice touch of firmness and elasticity. I would always recommend this product to everyone!!!!!</li>
    <li> very thick moisturizer.  no oily or greasy.</li>
    <li> Wife:  What have you been using?  Me: What?  Wife:  On your face?  Me:  Nothing - why?  Wife:  Don&#x27;t lie to me - cough it up.  Me:  Olay 7.  Wife:  Buy two next time.  Me:  Yes, dear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tempted to wear this day and night. It feels terrific on my skin. I haven&#x27;t ever used night cream. I&#x27;m sold now!</li>
    <li> my skin tingled on the first night after applying.  By night 3, my face completely broke out. I had raised blotches of bumps all over my face, my skin was burning, itching and to this day (3 days later), it is still bumpy and completely red.  my eye lids, both cheeks have huge blotches of inflamed redness to them.  chemical burn?  I&#x27;m hoping by end of week one, my skin will go back to normal :-( never ever using their products, again!</li>
    <li> This is amazing, this product reduce the wrinkles in my forehead its really good. you won&#x27;t regret using this product</li>
    <li> I enjoyed putting this on my face.Don&#x27;t know if it helped with wrinkles but just the fact that your using it you know it can&#x27;t hurt.I like the price and package.Don&#x27;t want to spend a ton for the same feelings would not be there.I think it has smoothed out some wrinkles and my skin is not at all dry anymore. My age almost 58 well you have to use something-anything well not really.Have to go with a well known product and expect it will work and it does no surprise since were talking Oil of Olay right .</li>
    <li> Looks pretty good. Waiting to see effect after some time passes.</li>
    <li> My wife uses this stuff.  She likes it and has always used Olay products.  Does it do anything?  I don&#x27;t know, as she always looks good to me.</li>
    <li> I just started using at age 65. When I look 55 again I will comment more. After I put it on I do feel like it is tightening my skin. Too early to tell if it works.</li>
    <li> I started using this product in December 2014 to help my skin get moisturized as I moved from the desert to the cold Michigan, and my skin got really dry. So I needed something to help it motorized it and don&#x27;t be to oily as my skin is oily enough.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over 6 months and my skin much more moisturized and soft. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to do a nice job. It would probably do better if I used it every day, but I don&#x27;t. It feels really nice going on, and it has a mild, pleasant scent. I will probably buy it agian.</li>
    <li> As expected; quick delivery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying  the product because it is Olay a name that I trust.  I am expecting great results and soon.</li>
    <li> I love this cream.  It goes on creamy but light (not greazy) leaves skin feeling soft &amp; supple! I have very dry skin because of my bad thyroid, but this cream has helped tremendously in just a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many night firming creams always hoping for great results. With this product, I really think I see results. My skin appears brighter and my wrinkles seem to be lessoning. I&#x27;m thrilled with this product. It also has a very nice, light, pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> Great night cream! Not greasy, mild fragrance. Skin feels soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice cream, smooths on very easily and makes my face feel great. I use it at night. Nice smell too.</li>
    <li> For me it was OK.  Still leaves my skin  feeling tight because I have quite dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have used olay products for years. A little expensive but they work much better than most of the other otc stuff. I have extrememly sensitive skin and the olay products have been great.  Non greasy but stays on all night. I will continue using this as long as they make it. I am 62 and have used it for years. Lots of compliments on my facial skin and always get asked what i use. Always Olay products.</li>
    <li> After I had been using the product a few weeks my 25-year old son mentioned that my face was looking great!  Thank you Olay Total Effects Night Firming Cream!</li>
    <li> You know, with things like these - it can be really hard to tell if it&#x27;s working. I mean, I always use Olay products all the time and some of them are stellar and some of them, like this - it&#x27;s like, who knows? I mean, I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a big difference between using this at night and using the regular Olay beauty fluid. BUT, I think I feel a little prettier when I use it.</li>
    <li> I had use this product for about a year. My skin looks great in the mornings. I feel a lot of firmeness and elaticity in my face. This product is very gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this cream!! Texture is nice. :) Not too sure about the firming. However, I do find this cream very moisturizing &amp; my skin feels good in the morning. I prefer this line over the Regenerist line which costs more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Review by Tom&#x27;s wife.</li>
    <li> Great.  Soothing without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and I bought this for use only on my neck and jawline. I have combination skin, my neck isn&#x27;t usually oily but this product made me break out. I gave it two stars instead of one because it works great on my hands! Obviously it&#x27;s expensive for a hand cream but I didn&#x27;t have to throw it in the trash because it didn&#x27;t work the way I was hoping. If you have combination/oily skin try to get a sample of it first just to make sure it doesn&#x27;t make you break out.</li>
    <li> I love Oil of Olay and have been using it for a number of years (the daily moisturizer). I got this night cream because I am now in my 40&#x27;s and am noticing my skin is changing and becoming dryer. I used this cream and it instantly made my face feel softer throughout the day. Also, true to Oil of Olay, I don&#x27;t have any adverse reactions such as blemishes. It is light and feels really good on my skin.</li>
    <li> Love this! I wake up to the softest skin ever! Received super fast and great price!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The scent is wonderful.  When you wake up in the morning your skin is moisturized.  Will keep buying this.  I use a lot of Olay products and like them all.  The price is great for the quality.</li>
    <li> Nice cream, nothing special though.  I like Olay products, this one is not my favorite.  Claims to do a little more than it actually does.</li>
    <li> If &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; means looking like a 15 year old with acne, then it succeeded.  I love Olay products, but this one really irritated my skin.  I got small white bumps all over my face and it really dried out my skin.  If you have sensitive skin, then I wouldn&#x27;t chance it!</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and not at all oily. Especially good for around the eyes, hitting the crows feet. Reasonably priced, effective product. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I remembered buying this on a whim and I was glad I did. The first time I used it, I felt the moisturizer working..My skin felt smooth and soft. Its a good replacement for the other expensive products I used to buy and does the same or better job.</li>
    <li> Bought this product based on the reviews by other shoppers.  Can&#x27;t say that I have been overwhelmed by the results.  Product sinks in without any noticeable difference in the look of my skin.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles but do expect to notice some difference over a period of weeks.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff day &amp; night</li>
    <li> I do not recognize that it is helpful.</li>
    <li> gifted this and she was happy,so im happy..</li>
    <li> I applied Olay Total Effects one time.  I thought the scent was strong, but hoped that it would dissipate in a few minutes.  Wrong.  I had to wash my face and hands - twice - to get rid of the stink.  And I do mean stink - overwhelming fake floral yukkiness.  Like perfume that costs $1.99 for 16 oz. at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If artificial fragrances bother you, give this one a pass.</li>
    <li> I am a 25 year old African American with oily and acne-prone skin.  People ask me why I would buy this being only 25 ALL THE TIME. Since my acne leaves marks and scars, this creme has dramatically aided in the healing process of my skin. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is soft, and after using this (along with the 7 effects acne face wash) my complexion is what I&#x27;ve wanted in high school! The price is unbeatable here on Amazon! I get compliments on my skin a lot, and coming from an acne suffer, that&#x27;s amazing to hear! I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! OLE, Olay!</li>
    <li> Love Olay total effects - the fragrance and everything except not enough in the container - should put little more in there</li>
    <li> This is perfect! I love it!</li>
    <li> I only use Olay products on my face.  I just go this, so I haven&#x27;t seen any of the results that they say will happen yet.</li>
    <li> The best product even the ones in red container they are amazing ,don&#x27;t spend hundreds for same results . I love and is my only oroduct</li>
    <li> this is my favorite face cream. I have oily acne prone skin and this is a great moisturizer. I use it all the time and my skin looks and feels great. The smell is soooooo good too. I really like putting it on at night so I wake up with a fresh face. I have noticed my skin tone is a lot more even and my skin is improved.</li>
    <li> This is a very soothing night cream.  Used it mostly on my neck.  I&#x27;ve used Olay products for years and am 64.  People say I look much younger.</li>
    <li> I read reviews all the time but never write any, but now I&#x27;ve decided to write because I appreciate the helpful reviews others have written that helped steer me in the right direction, so I want to give back and help others if I can. I&#x27;ve tried many products and for the most part have seen no difference in my skin. This includes many highly reviewed products. But this, along with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Stress Control Power-Cream Wash (which I also buy for a great price on Amazon too) are the only two things I can remember using that made a noticeable difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you know, I have rosacea, and had shiny, red, sometimes flushed and burning cheeks. I tried many things until I finally settled on this regimen and it has improved my skin greatly. It has more of a matte look instead of that shiny, red irritated look. I use the clarisonic Mia with the DELICATE brush. I ran out of it once and used the gentle brush that came with the Mia and saw and felt a definite difference. It was too rough on my skin and left it red and abused feeling. I use it with the Neutrogena product I mentioned in the first paragraph. (I was using the Neutrogena grapefruit wash before and that was NOT good. Left me very red.) Then I use this moisturizer. I used to use the same one in the daytime version, but that one would go on streaky and then crumble when I tried to wipe away the streaks. Also it looked kinda shiny and I didn&#x27;t like the way my skin looked with it on. The night version has none of those problems. I wear it day or night and when I put it on in bed without a mirror, if I get up to go the bathroom or something, when I look in the mirror I see no streaks. That was not the case with the daytime version which I used to use at night. I woke up in the morning with all kinds of crazy streaks. Also, I love the smell and feel of it while it&#x27;s going on. It feels a little cool which is just what my rosacea skin needs. You might not notice the cool feeling, but if you have rosacea then you definitely appreciate a cream that&#x27;s cool rather than warm when going on. Also, it&#x27;s hard to explain, but it makes my skin look really nice and glowing-like. Other reviewers have probably explained it better than me and all I can say is it&#x27;s true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more thing that I feel I should mention, though with many reservations and \\&quot;buts\\&quot;, is the Tanda Luxe. I bought one around the same time I adopted this skin care routine. I think it has also made a difference in my skin as far as the shinyness from rosacea but it also leaves my skin pleasantly flushed when I finish using it which might not be a good thing for Rosacea, but I&#x27;m unsure. Another reservation I have in recommending this is that all the reviews that complain about its battery are completely true. I have to charge it after every two times I use it. And lately it&#x27;s gotten even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you reading this that have rosacea, you should know that the products I use have ingredients that are not recommended for people with rosacea, but it works for me and my moderate rosacea. It might not work for you, and I guess we all have to find what works for us and our type of rosacea. I hope I&#x27;ve been helpful and wish you all the best!have rosacea then you definitely appreciate a cream that&#x27;s cool rather than warm when going on.

    <li> I am nearing 40 and I wanted something to enhance my wonderfully aging skin and Olay has been in the family, since my grandmother.  I have only had it for less than a month, but it seems to be working.  My skin loves it.</li>
    <li> I have chosen becouse it was recomanded by my friend.&lt;br /&gt; I am satisfied, It is good but not perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Yes i would recomend the product if you cannot afford  expencive one.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  No complaints.  Skin is always moisturized and the product smells good.  You only have to use a little bit.</li>
    <li> For the price I expected more from the product. I think any OTC product would of given the same results</li>
    <li> this product is so light and smooth feeling i use it every day and i love it i would buy again</li>
    <li> I am ok with not getting any younger but I do still like to take care of my skin. I love Olay products. I like their Total Effects line it is silky not to oily and the next day my skin feels wonderful. Wrinkles will always be there but they are not as obvious as they were before. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I received this product with no box and the jar was taped closed.  I thought I was buying a brand new item, not used.  The cream left my face greasy in the morning.  My face turned red and itchy.  It just was not what I expected.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND EXCELLANT  SERVICE</li>
    <li> this is one of the best cream of Olay, I used it in conjunction with the other 7 products. My skin looks clearer and smoother.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay products for over 40 years and am very pleased with the results. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> What a fabulous product!  Very light and smooth and makes my skin look so healthy!  It just feels so wondeful smoothing it on my face - fresh and clean!  I use only Olay products and always will.</li>
    <li> great coverage on your face, i just wish there was some sort of scent to it, otherwise wonderful product. THanks</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Firming Treatment-Excellent cream for dry skin. I am in my early 70&#x27;s &amp; find this cream to be one of the best moisturizers on the market sold at a reasonable price!</li>
    <li> I noticed a difference the very next morning after using this.  Some of my lines around my mouth were smoother and my face was very hydrated.  They say creams can&#x27;t really firm, but this one does.  Everyday my face looks better and better.</li>
    <li> I have used so many creams that I cant remember all they did. I do remember this one and it felt good...I had to use alot as I have very dry skin. Minus a star for that. Otherwise a good cream</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t quite finished my first jar yet, but my skin looked better after the first couple of days.  The skin on my neck looks firmer, and my sun spots seem lighter.</li>
    <li> I have always used this product -it makes my face so soft and smooth an it diminishes the look of fine lines and when u get up in the morning u can feel it still on and its so great</li>
    <li> Really enjoying this face cream. I can see a difference in my skin already. Thank you and so glad I purchased it!</li>
    <li> I love how this cream softens and hydrates my skin.  I have used it several years.  Wish it did more to fade age spots.</li>
    <li> I use this at night after toner. It also helps around my eyes. This cream along with other products is keeping 40 away a little longer, at least from my face.</li>
    <li> Good deal and like the product</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about a year at night before bed and really like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love the feeling of this lotion when I apply it before I sleep. My boyfriend loves the smell and I feel satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> I do really like it..but wouldnt&#x27; you just know it....all 70++ years of wrinkles are still hanging around!</li>
    <li> I love this product, but i did not want to pay the store price as it is quite a bit more.  So I am excited and I might be imagining it, but the product is making my skin much better.  It arrived in a timely fashion and undamaged. So if you are thinking about making a gift to yourself for your skin - ORDER now.  Thanks to everyone involved</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for 4 months and have been applying it to my face every night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Has a nice clean smell, moisturizes very well, makes my skin feel smooth, gets rid of dry spots. Also, a little goes a long way. I still have 1/3 of the product left after 4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Did not tighten/firm my skin whatsover. Did not prevent or smooth out any wrinkles as I noticed new wrinkles over time, and the smile wrinkles I have got worse and are more noticeable now. Lastly, this product made my skin look and feel VERY OILY. I don&#x27;t like wearing the product around other people as the shininess is embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is basically good as a moisturizer if you have dry skin, but isn&#x27;t really good for anything else. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend it, but looking at how other people have rated this, there is still a good chance that it could work well for you.</li>
    <li> I used the Olay total effects night cream, on and off...not very regular with it though. But as soon as I applied it, it felt great on my skin. It was immediately absorbed and my skin felt hydrated and smooth. My face looked healthier in the morning too. Maybe if I had used it regularly, I would have felt the effects more. Now I have the Olay regenerist night cream, which is not even close to this one. Going back to this for sure. The price too is affordable, I feel there is no need to spend a huge amount on the more expensive creams. This does the job just fine.</li>
    <li> This truly works!  Love the way it hydrates my skin, and firms it.  I have been using Olay for 2 years now, I can see the difference daily with their products.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. So much cheaper than in the store.</li>
    <li> Great product, for a great price.  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  It is rich and creamy, and feels wonderful when putting on.  I have to be careful not to use too much, because it doesn&#x27;t sink in very quickly.  I have been using this stuff for about three months and I have noticed a marked improvement in my skin.  My smile lines have softened dramatically, my pores look smaller, and my facial tone overall looks more even.</li>
    <li> I see improvement on my skin after using it within 2 weeks,my skin looks radiant,soft and younger looking.I will highly recommend this product,it works!</li>
    <li> Love it! I shopped around for weeks and found this inexpensive and most effective! Great for my sensitive skin too!</li>
    <li> Smooths on nicely.  Is a little different than some other products I had used.  But it delivered the moisture relief I was looking for.  Scent is minimal-gone before it is completely absorbed-just the way I like it.  Delivered quickly once ordered.</li>
    <li> I really like this, I was worry it would cause me to break out but so far nothing. I think my skin looks better, less shiny in places and helps repair discolouration and large pore scars but I do love it even if it was just a moisturiser .  Thank you will beordering. Bhighly recommen</li>
    <li> Recommend it highly.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist who is a top in the country recommends Olay products, which are as effective if not more than famous and expensive brands</li>
    <li> I love this Olay Total Effects Anit-Aging Night Firming Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I could feel the differense when I started using it.</li>
    <li> I have just been using it for a few weeks but my face is so soft and velvety. I use it every night, I am using it as more of a prevention of wrinkles since I am still in my twenties but my skin looks really great with this night treatment.</li>
    <li> I always gravitate towards Oil of Olay products because of their effectiveness. I had high hopes for this product. I have not noticed much of a difference at all. It says it is supposed to lighten up dark spots but mine are still as dark as can be...and I do wear sunblock during the day. I like how it smells and feels. The texture is smooth and creamy which I like and it does moisturize well. I just wish it worked the way it claims to work. Oh well. I still enjoy Oil of Olay products. If anyone out there knows of a tried and true product for lightening dark spots please let me know, Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. I feel like it actually works. I wish I could have a fragrance free version, but this isn&#x27;t irritating at all.</li>
    <li> using this for many years and has the best result.</li>
    <li> It leaves your skin so soft but not really a great moisturizer, you would still need additional cream at night.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good for my skin, after I use it these couple weeks, I really feel my skin more softer.</li>
    <li> no matter how hard i try, i still am not anti aging. but it probably doesnt work for all. think we all want to be younger looking</li>
    <li> I just love this product and the price is right</li>
    <li> It is an OK night cream. No miracles expected, no miracles delivered either.</li>
    <li> Sent this to my mom in California.</li>
    <li> I love this product and all the Olay line.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom and she loves it. Says she can see a difference in her skin. She likes that it makes her skin smooth and it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.</li>
    <li> I use this product every night to help keep my sensitive dry skin hydrated - which is a difficult task. It does the job well and does not irritate my skin. Has a light smell to it, but nothing too potent or irritating.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, light night cream.  It has a pleasant fragrance, that is barely noticable and fades quickly.  I like the way the cream feels when I apply it, like my skin is saying \\&quot;aahhh\\&quot;.  The cream soaks in quickly and is not oily or sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can not give it a higher rating because I did not find it to be effective at firming.  In fact it did not leave my skin as hydrated as other products I have used.  I will finish my jar, but will not repurchase.&lt;br /&gt;I am nearly 60 years old with fairly dry skin and I must need a need a more emollient product.  I think this one would work well for younger people.</li>
    <li> I bought from the 3 types of Olay total Effect, and I did try them after reading the instruction, There is no magical effect apeard after 1 month but there is diffrence, The company was very good in logistic maters</li>
    <li> I could not get the top off. I would like to return it but I have had back surgery and cannot get to post office. I normally love Olay products.</li>
    <li> I use it at night and another Olay moisturizer that&lt;br /&gt;keeps skin fresh and feeling good.  Olay is a&lt;br /&gt;reliable product with good results.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cream with niacin amide in the first few ingredients when I came across this.  Dr Oz. recommended niacin amide for wrinkles.  I have been using it for about 30 days as a night cream and am pleased with the results.  It does need to be stirred so wonder if there is not some sort of chemical change going on.  It did not mention the need to stir but it does separate out a bit.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay total effects anti-aging night cream for a year and it&#x27;s really give smoothness to the skin. Thus, it helps my skin look younger.</li>
    <li> I tried this but did not get a firming feel from it! I use another product that begins with a p and ends in a y called miracle worker that I think feels so much better! This is only good if I use a hydrolic acid cream under it! Otherwise I don&#x27;t feel I get any benefits from this! Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> great lotion it has a lil smell but goes right away and I love it for nighttime goes on great and helps out a lot</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this night cream. I have sensitive skin and often react to different creams, but this one has not effected me.  The only negative is that it is a little pricey.</li>
    <li> Alternate this with another Olay product,  I need lots of anti-aging!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I used this religiously every night for like 6 months and noticed that my skin felt more soft and smooth!  I don&#x27;t know if I believe that this is truly an anti-aging treatment (i think that diet and exercise is), but you can be the judge of that!  I have complex skin, some areas get really greasy, while others are dry and it helped all areas!  No dry patches on this face!</li>
    <li> I do like Olay products and this one does feel very good on.  I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks and I do like it.</li>
    <li> This is a good, thick cream but I personally feel that it&#x27;s not thick and moisturizing enough for night. I actually wear this for day and it looks fine under makeup. I rarely wear foundation and powder but when I do I don&#x27;t have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with other Olay products, and my face has not looked as good as it does now in almost 10 years. Olay products and switching to a vegan diet has done wonders for my skin&#x27;s tone and radiance. The lines in my forehead are almost completely GONE. Yes! Gone! As long as I keep my skin moisturized, you can&#x27;t see them at all until you get only a few inches from my face. My neck wrinkles look better too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m 27 and I have a 2 year old. I started getting forehead wrinkles around the time she was born and my skin has been very dry. Since I started using this, my skin has gone back to what it looked it years before I even had my daughter. I&#x27;ve had wrinkles on my neck since I was 14, and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that has made them look better. I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I did not see any difference. Plus it made my neck very dry and itchy. There is a lot left in the jar but I have discontinued using it.</li>
    <li> thought this was a good product bt a bit pricey did find the same thing in a generic brand that did just the same but the price was way better ad it only came in a single item.</li>
    <li> This product really does work.  I started using it right away and noticed results within a week.  Smoother, decreased wrinkles and diminished age spots.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as I love Olay regineris.  I was hoping this would be similar.  It is nothing more then a night cream.  While it is thick and creamy it didn&#x27;t do anything to firm my skin, diminish fine lines or even out my skin tone.  Disappointing</li>
    <li> I buy this for my wife,and she used every night.I even signed up for the subscribe and save option(to save a few dollars)It generally doesn&#x27;t smell much and I really like that it doesn&#x27;t mess up the bed.Would recommend.</li>
    <li> A very good product in great price at Amazon.com... it keeps the skin soft and glowing in the morning ...overall a good night cream...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product or the seller but my face broke out in rashes after using this a couple of times, I&#x27;ve used Olay products before so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem was. Will never use again.</li>
    <li> I did not notice the tightening feeling that other users described.  I use this in conjunction with my Olay recommended regimen.  I did not have any noticeable reduction in fine lines.  My pores were not refined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets one star for keeping my face more moisturized than not using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets another star for not making my face break out like the daily moisturizer my regimen wanted me to use four times a day.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference using products such as this on me.  If I had, Olay would be my preferred brand.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, just buy a good moisturizer and cleaner.</li>
    <li> I love this cream. I use it for night and day because it doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin breakout.</li>
    <li> I usually love the Olay products.  This order never made it to me. I hope my neighbor really likes it.</li>
    <li> This night cream is amazingly smooth. My face feels moisturized but not oily. It smells so good and I can honestly say that I have seen the wrinkles on my forehead smooth out. I love it!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it dries into my skin and I have to really scrub in the morning to get it off.</li>
    <li> Have been an Olay product user for many years. Love all their products. Love the creamy texture. Does not make face feel oily. Small amount goes a long way.</li>
    <li> this product is so good it feel so good on you face it not heavy. its very light. i can see a different in my skin.i will buy it again. on amazon</li>
    <li> I love Olay products. I&#x27;ve been using Olay since i turned 29. I am now 42 and my skin looks pretty good. Not too many wrinkles. With that said...  I tried the Total effects night firming cream and i don&#x27;t feel it is as good for my 42 year old skin as the Olay Pro-X Hydra firming cream. I feel this Total effects product would be great for later 20&#x27;s to mid 30&#x27;s. Just my opinion (and how my skin is). But i have been using the brand for years and Olay is an excellent product. I like how they have different product lines to go with the different age groups.  Just thought I would try the Total effects to compare it to the Pro-X.</li>
    <li> This cream works better than a more expensive cream I had, skin is nice and moisturized.  Wish it went on a bit smoother.</li>
    <li> I love this cream and Amazon has the best price for it.&lt;br /&gt;leaves my face soft.</li>
    <li> I deal with cystic acne and I hated my trial and errors of finding a good night cream. This is amazing stuff. I never wake up with new pimples on my face and it keeps my face moisturized even though I live in a very dry house with the new central air system in the house. I love olay.</li>
    <li> great night cream. love the smell. tried other night creams but always come back to this one.  already recommended to my friend.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and was comparing the ingredients list on the box with the ingredients stated on Amazon.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m disappointed.  This product doesn&#x27;t contain coconut oil or sucrose polycottonseedate as stated on Amazon, two of the ingredients that made me want to try this cream.  Amazon, please get your facts straight.  Unsure if I will return, since Olay products are generally good anyway, but I like to know what I&#x27;m acutally getting.</li>
    <li> I started using this 3 years ago after moving from Florida&#x27;s Gulf coast to Southern California (i.e...moist climate to dry climate) - I saw that I was developing fine lines and dry, patchy areas around my face and throat, and started using this cream every night after washing my face, but NOT drying it.  It really works!  (p.s...I&#x27;m 73, and have the facial skin of a woman 10-15 years younger and intend to stay that way!)BL</li>
    <li> This has a bit more cream in it to soften your skin. Very close to the regular Regenrist in helping smooth out those crow&#x27;s feet. This one you can apply to your all parts of your face/neck as you so desire !</li>
    <li> luv this  fast delivery thank you</li>
    <li> This product works just as well as the Regenerist line and at a much better price.  My skin stays soft and although I am too old to be totally wrinkle-free, it does reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Considering the price and the amount, I am very happy with the result when I put it. It&#x27;s not too light or too heavy. Love it</li>
    <li> The night cream is so creamy and really does a great job with my face. I put it on every night and it always feels great in the morning.</li>
    <li> This moisturizer is described as Fragrance Free, but it is decidedly not - one of the more fragrant moisturizers I ever used.  My sensitive skin much prefers fragrance free moisturizers, and that was my sole reason for puchasing this one, so I was very disapointed.</li>
    <li> I would give it five stars, but I was looking for a little heavier moisturizer for over night.  This is light enough to use during the day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my 40s now and am lucky to have young looking skin, but I am positive that Olay products have helped me. I&#x27;ve been using versions of their face creams for about 15 years. I am a fan for life. This one is great- not as perfumed as others. I use it every night.</li>
    <li> I wish I had paid more heed to some of the reviews on here before buying this.  The cream smells good, not overpowering, and feels good on the skin.  However, the next morning I woke up to tiny pimple-like bumps all over my nose.  Let me interject here that I RARELY ever get breakouts anymore at my age (early 40s).  Not pleased at all, and won&#x27;t ever buy this again!</li>
    <li> Another Olay product I love, can&amp;#34;t say enough about this product either,its wonderful to use, makes my skin very soft</li>
    <li> I love olay, but this is nothing compared to my purple olay night recovery cream. This is still a great product, I just like other Olay products more for my skin Type: Dry, aging, crows feet.</li>
    <li> I do not like it at all. It feels oily and makes little pebbles when I massage my skin. I am not even sure it is healthy to the skin.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super cheap compare to all other international brand, but it does its job just fine :)</li>
    <li> Not creamy or moisturizing enough!!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this cream for a week or so, but my skin has never felt so smooth.  I am a huge fan of Olay products but wanted to try something different.  This has a thick, rich, creamy texture.  A little goes a long way...I could see feeling greasy if you used too much.  My skin looks brighter and is so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One head&#x27;s up: it has a kind of detergent like smell.  Not really perfume smelling like other Olay creams, but seriously more like a laundry detergent.  It&#x27;s not terrible, but for those sensitive to smells be forewarned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have used Olay for many years and I love it. Olay Regenerest is next</li>
    <li> I love this mainly because it&#x27;s not greasy but still has the effect of an anti aging cream. Too many creams these days are laden with much too oil, but this is great!</li>
    <li> Not sure I&#x27;ve seen a change as of yet. I bought this more to hold off aging. But I will say I love the texture and feel of this product. A little goes a long way and it smells wonderful.  We will see after a few more weeks. I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> A present for friends. They are happy with this cream. I have no further news about it.</li>
    <li> wife loves it I&#x27;m happy</li>
    <li> Used the whole container, but couldn&#x27;t discern any visible change. Cream goes on easily, feels nice, and smells good...but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin feel soft and look dewy.</li>
    <li> I find that this night cream gives my skin a firmer, more fine texture and try to use it every night.</li>
    <li> I love the feel and fragrance of it.</li>
    <li> Just started using this...like it so far</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now.  I&#x27;m not noticing too much in the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34; department yet, however I like the cream a lot.  I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother or irritate it at all.  The smell is pleasant and the cream goes on smooth.  I wake up &amp;#34;fresh-faced&amp;#34; without an oily sheen as I&#x27;ve expreienced using other night creams.  I&#x27;ll keep watching on the &amp;#34;firming&amp;#34;, but I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I simply love Olay products. Not sure how effective this is, though. It is light and absorbs easily. But I can&#x27;t see any change in my skin. Fragrance is pleasant and not too strong.</li>
    <li> This has product has my face looking so dewy and young.  It has my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It is worth buying for your skin.</li>
    <li> Very good product. I will purchasre again.</li>
    <li> very nice product. works great</li>
    <li> love it, this is my first time using this cream, I love how smooth my skin feel after each use</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried this product and I am impressed. I have been using this product for a little over 3 weeks and I am seeing results. I have a skin discoloration on my face and it is much lighter than before and I&#x27;m also seeing a reduction in the size of my pores on my face. It has been along time since I have used an Olay product and I glad to see that they are very effective and reasonably priced. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> No leaks perfect condition</li>
    <li> This was a great deal on this product.  The product was shipped the next day and I am happy with the product</li>
    <li> Item works great, smells great, its a cream so i will not know if it works until some time, but so far i love it</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell and it did not have the same noticeable effects that the regenerist cream does.</li>
    <li> I found a definite improvement in the morning in difficult areas.  Good to find something that really makes a difference.</li>
    <li> OK, it doesn&#x27;t make me look 30 again, but it has a lot to work with.  But, I really like this product.  Not a strong odor; very pleasant.  Makes my skin feel good and people say I look younger than my 72 years, so maybe it is due to Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Better then the high dollar stuff and does not break me out like many of the $$$ serums do. Skin felt grerat the next morning but took about a week to see noticeable difference in fine lines.</li>
    <li> Item was as described.</li>
    <li> Has not helped in any shape or form. I am currently also using Product 7 that does work. Tried using this along with it and it has done nothing. Doesn&#x27;t work other than to get my face and neck soft.</li>
    <li> I really like this night cream.  My skin is dry and it hydrates it very nicely.  I prefer Oil of Olay products.  I have been using them for years</li>
    <li> I spent 3 days researching night creams, finally decided on this one, and I&#x27;m so glad I did! While I am only 26, I&#x27;ve had noticeable wrinkles around my eyes and for head for years, including two very deep ones between my eyebrows. Much to my surprise, after only a week, even those deep lines have greatly improved! I have very delicate, pale, skin, it&#x27;s very translucent and dry. This has caused no irritation, even on my dry, sore, patches from this rough winter weather. I&#x27;ve also been applying this nightly to my breasts, which look markedly improved. They deserve some tlc after two years of breastfeeding and yoyo weight changes. It&#x27;s even helping my stomach, which changed a bit after birth 7 years ago! I&#x27;m rather amazed! This is definitely a new staple product for me!</li>
    <li> it works well, but has a very strong scent, so I stopped using it</li>
    <li> I really like this firming cream.  I noticed late this morning that it really helps.  I like the feel of the moisturizer that is in this face cream.</li>
    <li> Good overnight product. Most of my skincare regimen consists of Olay products. Always high quality &amp; at a good price.</li>
    <li> I can only use this around my eyes and on my neck, anywhere else results in white heads/pimples. While I am getting fine lines I&#x27;ll have to find something not so heavy to use. On the positive my skin does feel great after using it and my eyes don&#x27;t look as tired in the mornings.</li>
    <li> I did not give it the full 5 stars because I have only been using it for a couple of weeks.  I already love the product.  My skin feels more hydrated then it has in years. I will definitely keep ordering this cream.  And a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel at night. Not too heavy and a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> Always have loved Olay products and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> So far I am happy with this night time creme. It has no scent and does not feel to heavy on my face.</li>
