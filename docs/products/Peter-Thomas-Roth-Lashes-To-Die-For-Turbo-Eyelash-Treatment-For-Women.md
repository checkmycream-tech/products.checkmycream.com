### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Very happy with results.  </li>
      <li>Another benefit is I have been using it on my eyebrows and they look GREAT.</li>
      <li>A great product I recommended this.</li>
      <li>I have a condition and medication that has caused great thinning of my hair and consequently, my eye lashes.  </li>
      <li>The ingredients in this product ARE good but glycerin and herbs do not make your eyelashes grow longer.</li>
      <li>Does just as ad claims, (surprising).  </li>
      <li>It is as good as the prescription brand, but you don&#x27;t need a doctor prescription.  </li>
      <li>My husband says they look better than they ever have!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I would see quicker results if I would put on every night!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for about a week and am very impressed so far.</li>
      <li>It has sped up the growth of her eyebrows, and her lashes seem to be coming it thicker, longer, and more rapidly.  </li>
      <li>Also when I wear mascara my lashes look phenomenal.</li>
      <li>Still it did make them grow :)</li>
      <li>I is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>So far so good, I couple it with the lashes to die for mascara</li>
      <li>if this works, I will order more; this price was right.</li>
      <li>I was a loyal user of LiLash</li>
      <li>I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying other products til I find one that works as good as LiLash.</li>
      <li>only use on top lid).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the combination of these two products, but my lashes are already much improved.</li>
      <li>I saw new lash growth in about 2 weeks of consistent use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m also blonde, and it has made my lashes significantly darker.</li>
      <li>i would like to buy a new one in sephora</li>
      <li>This product didn&#x27;t live up to what it promised.</li>
      <li>Amazon used to offer generic (the real Latisse sans the name)</li>
      <li>I have been using this product in conjunction with the Dior Maximizer lash serum, which goes directly on the lashes like mascara.</li>
      <li>I am very disappointed,because I have used similar products in the past and they worked quickly and well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used the product for 2 weeks so far and have not noticed a difference in the length of my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll swipe some on for a more dramatic effect.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product since the first of February, and I can see very little difference.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had eyelash extensions for almost a year and just got them removed. I have been using this stuff every night for about 3 weeks now and can definitely see a difference. My husband says they look better than they ever have! I will definitely continue using.</li>
    <li> A few months ago, my daughter started to pull her eyelashes and eyebrows.  While she can go a few weeks without pulling, when she does its devastating.  A friend of mine gave us a tube of this product to try, and it is life changing for us.  It has sped up the growth of her eyebrows, and her lashes seem to be coming it thicker, longer, and more rapidly.  Believe me when I tell you we have tried almost everything on the market to help aid in faster hair growth.  In addition to this product, she is taking Biotin each day, so I believe it is the combination of both products that is working for her.</li>
    <li> A great product I recommended this.</li>
    <li> I have a condition and medication that has caused great thinning of my hair and consequently, my eye lashes.  I had hope this product would really help my eye lashes, but the results so far have been a bit disappointing.  There has been some improvement, but not a lot.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for the six weeks I&#x27;d read (in Allure magazine) it takes to work, but I think my lashes have gotten longer and a little thicker.  I intend to keep using it.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I couple it with the lashes to die for mascara</li>
    <li> I have always had thick eyelashes, but with age they began thinning.  I have been using this brand for about three years.  I is fantastic.  Does just as ad claims, (surprising).  I have thick long lashes.  The only drawback is, when you quit using the treatment, your lashes begin to thin.  Needless to say, I buy more.  It is as good as the prescription brand, but you don&#x27;t need a doctor prescription.  My eye doctor charges $50.00 just to write the script!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blondcookie</li>
    <li> This is my second tube. I stuck with this because I trust the PTR brand and it works. It&#x27;s one of those products that you need to keep using daily to see results but you will see results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week and am very impressed so far. I&#x27;m seeing lots of little baby lashes growing where I had spaces before. I&#x27;m also blonde, and it has made my lashes significantly darker. I have been using this product in conjunction with the Dior Maximizer lash serum, which goes directly on the lashes like mascara. This product goes on just at the base. I don&#x27;t know if it is the combination of these two products, but my lashes are already much improved. I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any results very disappointed</li>
    <li> This stuff does not work...used it for almost a year.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this or any others here at Amazon. Amazon used to offer generic (the real Latisse sans the name) Latisse at a fraction of the cost. Of course it works. No side effects. My eyes NEVER changed colors as they claim is a possibility, ect. Now I order the generic on-line. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two years and my eyelashes are so long and thick you&#x27;d swear I was wearing mascara which I don&#x27;t even need any longer. I just curl them. If I&#x27;m going out to dinner I&#x27;ll swipe some on for a more dramatic effect. Another benefit is I have been using it on my eyebrows and they look GREAT. Thick eyebrows again! I pluck and shape them and they make you look much younger. Too bad a couple of my friends actually had theirs tattooed on. I would never do that and now they regret it also. Listen ladies. The ingredients in this product ARE good but glycerin and herbs do not make your eyelashes grow longer. You&#x27;d get the same results by putting Vaseline on them every night. If anything this product just helps keep them from falling out.</li>
    <li> Does Nothing! Not worth buying and costly as well!!</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference at all in my eyelash growth....disappointed.....</li>
    <li> I saw new lash growth in about 2 weeks of consistent use. Also when I wear mascara my lashes look phenomenal. Only problem is that about ~5-6 of my lashes from each eye grow extra long(I only use on top lid). Some even start looking a little bent and look a little odd at times. Still it did make them grow :)</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen results yet.  if this works, I will order more; this price was right.</li>
    <li> The package was not seal and the product had no information or directions with it.  I have seen this product in other stores and every time the box was seal as well as the product inside.  It looked as if it was used.  Sorry had to send it back.</li>
    <li> I love this product! In 2wks I noticed my eyelashes were fuller. I&#x27;m sure I would see quicker results if I would put on every night!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say much because when using it(that was only few days) i got some bad sides effect and had to stop using it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t buy it !! it&#x27;s like a used one. i am not sure whether is new or not.and it&#x27;&#x27;s also expensive. i would like to buy a new one in sephora</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been two weeks using the product every day.  My lashes are growing fuller and longer.  Very happy with results.  Not sure what will happen when I discontinue use.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t live up to what it promised. My eyelashes improved slightly. They were a bit fuller but not longer. Very disappointed. I was a loyal user of LiLash but you can&#x27;t buy that product in the U.S. through their website. I purchased it a few times through other online sellers but was sold imitation versions that didn&#x27;t work. I guess I&#x27;ll keep trying other products til I find one that works as good as LiLash.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any changes. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll have to go back to using Latisse which is very expensive but the results are amazing.</li>
    <li> Received shipping on time.  I&#x27;ve only used the product for 2 weeks so far and have not noticed a difference in the length of my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since the first of February, and I can see very little difference. I am very disappointed,because I have used similar products in the past and they worked quickly and well.Will not buy this brand again.</li>
