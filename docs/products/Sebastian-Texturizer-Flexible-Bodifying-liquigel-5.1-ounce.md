      <li>I have very fine hair that is SUPER curly.</li>
      <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
      <li>This gel isn&#x27;t as good as the old Sebastian gel they discontinued but its ok.</li>
      <li>to say that surprisingly despite my initial disbelief it works nicely - adds volume, texture and manageability.</li>
      <li>Sebastian has been around a long time and is a very good company.</li>
      <li>It also looks great the next day - all I do is run wet fingers through it, and it looks perfect!</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair</li>
      <li>It gives my fine hair texture.  </li>
      <li>The product is light and does not leave residue.</li>

      <li>This GEL is fantastic.</li>

      <li>...used product before it&#x27;s very consistent.......</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve not been able to find it any place i.e. CVS, Walgreens, or my new hairdressers</li>
      <li>It REALLY works!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Amazing stuff. It REALLY works!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Sebastian Texturizer for quite a few years. I&#x27;ve had to ask my Stylist to get it for me in specialized stores for Professionals only. I decided to see if it could be purchased elsewhere...I looked it up and Amazon is my place to shop from now on. This product is fabulous!</li>
    <li> I am down to my last bottle of texturizer and was starting to panic. About 2.5 years ago,I had purchased 6 bottles at clearance of $6 each in downtown Vancouver as I heard it was being discontinued. I am so glad to see it on Amazon!! I have the old packaging (white bottle) and hope the black bottle is the same \\&quot;liquid gold\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried other products, this one \\&quot;delivers\\&quot; for us fine haired folk who yearn for more fullness &amp; body. Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> This product is unlike any I have used before! It actually DOES define curl and gives my hair the look I want and a great texture. It smells good and is not sticky. I am so impressed. I will be buying this from now on!!!</li>
    <li> Love all the Sebastian products. I have very fine straight hair and this is a great styling product without feeling gunky. It costs at least $19 at Beauty First.</li>
    <li> This gel isn&#x27;t as good as the old Sebastian gel they discontinued but its ok. It&#x27;s not my new replacement and ill try other brands .. But it works ok...just not as good</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a gel that isn&#x27;t stiff and holds all day then this your product. Sebastian has been around a long time and is a very good company. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser. He uses it every time he does my hair and swears by it. I now use it myself and love it! Great hair product!</li>
    <li> Water based, sleek, high quality product - worth the price!  I have finally found THE hair product for me.  I will continue to purchase it.  I thankfully found it when I could no longer find the Sebastian Wet Gel.</li>
    <li> this is the best gel I have ever used. I have used the product for many years and continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy this version of the Sebastian Texturizer cause I have always used the other bottle of sebastian texturizing gel that has been discontinued and is for sale for $30 or more dollars.  This product is the same and is less expensive by the ounce.  Great product and great price</li>
    <li> The Amazon pricing was the best I&#x27;ve found in years and the product works great.</li>
    <li> As a reference point, I have straight hair of a medium thickness that generally refuses to do anything except lay limply against my head.  This stuff is amazing. I just cut 17 inches off of my hair, and now I have a chin-length style.  I wanted something that would texturize, and give me a little bit of volume while keeping my hair from poofing out.  This definitely does the trick. It also looks great the next day - all I do is run wet fingers through it, and it looks perfect!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really evaluate the product.  However my wife loves the stuff and never running out helps keep the boss happy.  😊</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have found for my fine, thin, straight hair.  Nothing else even comes close.  It makes my hair seem thicker and definitely more manageable.  Not gloppy or sticky like many other similar products.  I take it with me to my hair appointments and even my stylists have raved about the difference it makes.</li>
    <li> This product is well worth the money! It lasts a long time and really gives your hair alot of body without that hard,sticky texture. It&#x27;s a product that I would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for many years and love the product. Its my first time ordering it online so I was a bit worried about spillage enroute from the US in my kids&#x27; luggage to my home in Costa Rica.  I shouldn&#x27;t have worried.  It was packaged in a sealed plastic bag and arrived perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have very long (butt-length) and very thin hair. I was looking for a product that would add some volume to my flat hair. While this product does add a bit of volume, I didn&#x27;t find too great of a difference. Perhaps the length of my hair weighs it down. It does make my hair feel softer however. I gave four stars because it&#x27;s a bit too expensive for just a minor difference to my hair.</li>
    <li> After trying many such gels, this one is my favorite. Just a little bit applied to damp hair is all it takes for hold and shine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product, at least for thin hair with some body.  The product is light and does not leave residue. It feels good to the touch and leaves the hair with a nice sheen.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  It works like a mousse/gel to give my thin straight hair some bounce, but isn&#x27;t sticky and actually makes my hair feel softer.  LOVE it.</li>
    <li> It makes your hair look nice and look more natural and feel more natural but the hold is not too strong. so, depends what kinda hair you have , so it can be either GREAT for your hair or nearly or completely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: looks nice. feels nice. mild hold</li>
    <li> I bought this product hoping to find a less expensive alternative to Redkin Wool Shake, which is costing me over $20/month. Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product. My hair is very fine/straight/limp, and does not do ANYTHING without significant hair product investment. The first time I used this product, I was dismayed to discover that it made my hair even softer than it already was, which added absolutely NO texture and very very minimal body. This product is a pump (not spray), so you have to rub it on your hands and then rub your hands through your hair. As I blow dried my hair, I noticed that the hair was super silky smooth - almost like what your face feels like after applying a face serum. While it felt nice to the touch (definitely NOT sticky), my hair was totally limp and I could not do a thing with it. I tried it a couple more times, thinking I just needed to figure out the \\&quot;trick\\&quot; to this product. After all...how could there possibly be so many wonderful reviews on it? Maybe this product works for folks with different hair types than mine, but for very fine/straight/limp hair, this is NOT going to add any texture to your hair whatsoever. Your hair will feel silky soft, and not sticky, but it&#x27;s going to be flat flat flat.  I&#x27;m definitely returning it and will likely go back to Wool Shake, and see if there are any options on getting it in a more cost effective size than the current 5oz bottle. It&#x27;s a wonderful product (*definitely* adds texture), albeit expensive.</li>
    <li> Perhaps all hair. I don&#x27;t know. But I have fine thin hair and this stuff gives me so much body without being stiff or gooey.  Best hair product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This product arrived wrapped in plastic wrap which was a good thing since it leaked!  I have ordered this before and have not had this but this was a mess!</li>
    <li> This texturizer can be used on dry or wet hair.  You can leave it on and use it to style without blow drying or with blow drying. It is not heavy or stiff.  It has a very light scent that does not leave you smelling like a fruit salad!</li>
    <li> Doe to the extensive hair loss after the baby #2, I was shining my scalp through the hair I had left. That made me really look for something that would help with the problem in hand.&lt;br /&gt;Have to say that surprisingly despite my initial disbelief it works nicely - adds volume, texture and manageability.</li>
    <li> the best on the market</li>
    <li> I purchased this product at my hairdressers before I moved, and love it.  I&#x27;ve not been able to find it any place i.e. CVS, Walgreens, or my new hairdressers so I purchased it on-line.  It arrived very quickly and it&#x27;s exactly what I used to get at my hairdressers and at less cost.</li>
    <li> Grear product. Have been using for many years.</li>
    <li> no matter how much I tried nothing came out of the container</li>
    <li> I have used Sebastian products for 16 years, and I have never had a complaint. They are one my favorite hair products.</li>
    <li> Great product, fast easy purchase.</li>
    <li> Really cloying smelly smell.  I couldn&#x27;t get past that so I haven&#x27;t actually tried it.  Non-returnable so watch out.</li>
    <li> Started using this instead of volumizer cause of price and it works great in my hair. Will purchase again if still in my price range</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a decade on my shortish curly hair. I have yet to find another product that controls my curls and frizzies like Texturizer. It is somewhat stiff when it dries but then eases up when I &amp;#34;scrunch&amp;#34; my hair before leaving the house. I used to buy it at my salon but since changing hairdressers, I buy it online for the same price. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a terrific smell after it dried, but it has none. Got a speedy delivery from the vendor here on Amazon. Good luck and I hope you like the product.</li>
    <li> Great product ... been using it for 20 years.</li>
    <li> Love it. Not thick or sticky. Gives a lot if body</li>
    <li> This is the best product for thin straight hair!!!  I have been using it for over 15 years!! My fear is they will stop making it!!</li>
    <li> Very nice product holds my hair nicely.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky and gross.  Gives it body and keeps it from being frizzy. I have bought several times.</li>
    <li> This is the same product I&#x27;ve used for years  but at a much lower price than salons charge. I am familiar with  product. I bought it strictly because of the pricing.</li>
    <li> I used the old Sebastian Texurizer gel.  When they stopped making it I bought this product.  As far as I can tell, it works just like their original product.  I have fine, thin hair and need volume and this provides that volume.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I put it in my hair while wet (rinse hands w/water only to remove) Once my hair dries completely, I&#x27;ll scrunch all of the gel areas to get rid of the wet stiff look, &amp; the curls stay.  I have a lot of hair &amp; it&#x27;s thick.  Tried others, always go back.</li>
    <li> Almost $10 less than in the salon!  Great product!</li>
    <li> all I know is my wife likes it</li>
    <li> Great product but I find it hard to get where I live. Great price and free shipping &#x3D; HAPPY!</li>
    <li> Great product for a good price</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this product for my fine flat hair. It works great applied to damp hair just before styling with a hairdryer. It provides volume, texture, and lift. I also do not need as much hairspray after using this product.</li>
    <li> not a great product and I wonder where the good reviews come from. leaves hair sticky and unmanagable. cannot recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I have shoulder length hair and can get away with using 1 pump&#x27;s worth of product. I use this before blow drying, then I use the Sebastian Trilliant to spray just before using a curling iron. I get compliments on my hair all the time now. My hair is the perfect volume. It&#x27;s not flat and it&#x27;s not huge. My hair doesn&#x27;t even look like it has product in it!</li>
    <li> While I do love this actual product, THERE IS A FALSE BOTTOM AND YOU ONLY GET 2OZ!!!!!! The pump broke on mine and I had to take it apart to salvage the product itself. Less than HALF of that bottle is actual product, the bottom half is hollow. I transferred the rest into a sized bottle and got less than 2oz after only 5 or so uses (nickel sized dollop, less than a teaspoon). Shame on you Sebastian!!! I called and complained and sent photos. We&#x27;ll see what they do :(</li>
    <li> I have very fine hair that is SUPER curly. All the other products I have tried leave my hair frizzy. This is the first product I have found that really tames the frizz. My only complaint is that it can make your hair look wet on top and like it has product in it. Also, my curls are a bit crunchy with this product in my hair. But the trade-off is worth it because my hair looks much better with larger, tame curls than a big frizzy birds nest on top.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I have ever used.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it.  Have used it for several years.  Best product on the market for adding volume to your hair.</li>
    <li> I like this liquid gel product thought I wish it would provide a stronger hold. I like that it&#x27;s manageable, non-sticky and has a very light scent.</li>
    <li> great for curly and frizzy hair. leaves hair soft and not stiff.  great also if you want to leave hair straight</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It holds my hair without looking like gel or stiff.  It is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> Its not as good as the old one... in the white bottle... sighs.....</li>
    <li> This GEL is fantastic. I have thick coarse hair that is usually requiring hair spray, and that makes my head itch. This product leaves my hair very manageable and I don&#x27;t need hair spray at all, this GEL keeps my hair in place, and best of all it doesn&#x27;t feel GOOEY like most gels. I just put it on wet hair and then blow dry my hair.  I highly recommend this product.  Judy</li>
    <li> I like it, I think it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my baby fine hair have so much body.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found that works well year round with my thin, fine, silky hair. It keeps volume in my hair all day.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  I have baby fine hair and this does nothing for it.  It won&#x27;t hold a curl and I always have really bad static hair when I use it.  I might as well have bought hair gel at the grocery store.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and texturizer gives it more volume.  I would recommend this product to others that might need volume.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  It gives my fine hair texture.  I get a lot of compliments on my hair when I use this product.</li>
    <li> This works very well but leave a sticky or odd texture to the hair. I will try another Sebastian product to find something that will have a softer feel after it&#x27;s applied.</li>
    <li> Helps hold a light curl in my thin hair, whether it&#x27;s raining or humid, or completely dry outside. I wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
    <li> ...used product before it&#x27;s very consistent.......It keeps hair in place with no flaking..........will definitely continue using as long as product is available and reasonably priced</li>
    <li> I have extremely fine,straight, limp hair. This product gives me the body my hair needs and I can&#x27;t do without it.&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser uses it too.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Have used it for years on my short hair. I will continue to order</li>
    <li> Using this product, I found that it makes for an attractive hairdo, especially for fine hair, but I have not found a way for the hair to maintain its set overnight., and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to recapture the hairdo the next day no matter what you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other observation: If you have cats for pets, who climb up on bathroom counters, who occasionally knock things off, you might find that the container of this merchandise, although plastic, breaks rather easily, and that is what happened to this item. It was knocked off the bathroom counter, and broke the neck of the container right where the bottom of the lid comes, a very clean break.&lt;br /&gt; I am now dipping it out a jar to put on my hair.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my friend and she&#x27;s loving it</li>
    <li> I love this product it gives me just the right volume and flexibility.  If I didn&#x27;t love it so much I wouldn&#x27;t have gone to all the trouble of ordering it online (although ordering through Amazon made it a pleasant experience!) I would have just used another product that claims to do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> As a &amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34; it&#x27;s hard to find a product that tames my curls without giving my hair a wet look, but this one does it!! I have been using this product forever and now my daughter uses it.  We both love it!!</li>
    <li> If your looking for a product that adds body to fine limp hair this is the product for you.  I love it. Makes my hair look thicker and full. Used to use Nick Chavez&#x27;s products for hair. This is so much better</li>
    <li> I use this product every day.  After washing my hair, I apply a small amount, then  blow  my hair dry.  It is wonderful to add body, especially if you have fine hair.  I&#x27;ve used it at least 5 years.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Greatest hair thickener I have ever used.I have been using this for over 10 years.  One Tip, a little drop goes a long way. I use it when my hair is still wet and work it in. Results, Fabulous shine, bounce and aroma. I would never discontinue. I did try other products and very disappointed. This is definitely a Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have thick but fine hair and this is the only product that gives it the body I need. It&#x27;s an amber gel that I put in my hair while still damp.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I like to squirt in a small amount into a mousse! I find that it holds my style all day long! GREAT product and I will be a return customer of Sebastian!</li>
