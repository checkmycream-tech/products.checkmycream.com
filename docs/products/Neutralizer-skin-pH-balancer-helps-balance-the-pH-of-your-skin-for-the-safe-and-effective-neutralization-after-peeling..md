<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a blessed thing for me when i used it after using repeated chemical peels. Went back to using cold compresses and cold water rinses. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> dont really work as well as i thought</li>
    <li> comes in excellent condition</li>
    <li> Great product and it comes with a trial size facial peel 35% glycolic acid. Left my face nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> Love love love. Once finding cellbone products, i was completely impressed by the quality and improvement of my skin. Their website isnt flashy but very informative.</li>
    <li> Bought an at home microdermabrasion machine, I use this after I use the machine.  It does help balance skin nicely</li>
    <li> I really liked this product because once you felt the burn... whew!  You love anything that cools it off.  lol Seriously though... it does help.  But... the old baking soda and water mixture does just as well and it&#x27;s cheaper so... while I like this, I&#x27;ll go with the cheaper version.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good quality product but as I am new to doing peels, I didn&#x27;t realize that putting cold water on your face neutralizes the acid as well.  But it did make me feel better to put some witch hazel on my face.</li>
    <li> It does work neutralizing the Glycolic Peel.</li>
    <li> This makes a great difference in the skin. I use it on all my clients. They love it. I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great for body, face, hair, goes on smooth and not oily.  It&#x27;s great before apply make up or after peels to freshen up.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 35% glycolic peel and wanted to use this neutralizer to help after the peel.  I have found it to be a waste of money.  This could be because of the brand of peel I have, my skin, etc. I find water works just as well, if not better.  I do not have sensitive skin, so this may help those who have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used 35% glycolic peel because I&#x27;m very fair and have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t know that this was a necessary purchase. I don&#x27;t notice any redness or irritation after peels and neutralizer, but I suspect this is a result of such a mild peel. The last time I used a peel I just splashed with cold water and added a little Cetaphil facial lotion and was just fine. However, it came with a sample of lactic acid which is awesome, and I suspect I may update the effects of the neutralizer as I move up to higher concentrations of glycolic acid.</li>
    <li> Thank you, works well. My gift was also a nice treat.. actually purchased a few items and I will buy from you in the future...(skin feels and looks better than ever).</li>
    <li> Did not work on my face to stop the burning - did not like, but did arrive in a good timeframe.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it claims to do, have to love when that happens!   Works great to stop the burn from peels.</li>
    <li> I ordered this neutralizer to go with a glycolic acid peel I had also ordered.  The company sent me a (free?) glycolic peel, as well, so I have used these two products together.  Very awesome.  It says there may be slight peeling or reddening of the skin with the peel, but the neutralizer works very well so I haven&#x27;t had any bad experiences.  Instead, I get refreshed-looking, healthy skin.  I really love this product.</li>
    <li> fast shipped, received items quicker than expected.  The 35% glycolic-lactic peel works just as expected, but first time users should follow directions and not go over the time permitted.  Results are amazing just after first treatment.  Love the neutralizer and prep...being in the skin care field, I just love all the products..</li>
    <li> A must for glycolic acid peels. Does what it claims. Will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> You know the feeling, the burn that keeps going, even after you have removed your peel. This product puts a gentle and soothing halt to it. Peel is over, no lingering burning. Just soothing cool relief. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this review helpful? Let me know. Please vote. :-)</li>
    <li> This product instantly soothes my skin after the peel solution. I was surprised when I recieved a FREE  bottle of the 35% peel solution in my package! The order arrived very fast. The free peel has definately earned this company a return customer.</li>
    <li> It soothes the itching and burning on your face after an acid peel. The instructions say to wash face after but I just leave it on and let it dry.</li>
    <li> This product worked great. It was necessary to balance the ph in my skin and this product did the job.</li>
    <li> First, this is an excellent product.  It takes the \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; from chemical peels away instantly.  However, if you suffer from chronic acne, I think that it may cause eruptions, which is especially bad if you&#x27;re using a chemical peal in order to treat your acne.  Still, though, if you&#x27;re unsure, I suggest that you try it because I have a feeling that this \\&quot;side-effect\\&quot; is quite rare.</li>
    <li> It balanced my pH better than chlorine balances a swimming pool infested with algae!&lt;br /&gt;Good shipping.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t notice a difference when using this product.</li>
    <li> For an African American woman suffering from some serious adult acne, this product is fantastic!! I&#x27;ve used this product for the past couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is starting to \\&quot;take\\&quot; to the product and I&#x27;m not breaking out as much. One suggestion I will make, is gradually work your way up to longest time allowed. I went 3 minutes on my first try (like an idiot)and even though I didn&#x27;t blister my skin, it was very close. As long as you follow the directions and remember your sunscreen you will be good.</li>
    <li> Coming from a professional.  I don&#x27;t know the product, but if it says neutralizer you need it!!!!!  Glycolic will continue to activate until a neutralizer is added.  If you are a professional you would know this.    Hope you take my suggestion.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly, packaged well &amp; as described.  I did place it in the refrigerator prior to use.  Unfortunately it did not take away the stinging sensation from the peel, it seemed to just rub it around!  So I did end up using baking soda &amp; cool water mixture as I have read it is recommended for PH balance to neutralize the acid. I am going to use the remainder of the bottle since I purchased it &amp; follow with the mixture but I will not be purchasing again, big waste of $$.</li>
    <li> I purchased this thinking it was going to be necessary for a peel, but I honestly didn&#x27;t notice a difference between this and tap water when it came to taking the sting out of it. If you&#x27;re really into the hardcore peels like TCA 20 &amp; up, this MIGHT be beneficial, but for me, when using the [[ASIN:B0018ZPZJC 15% TCA Acid Chemical Peel For Anti Aging and Acne Skin Care]], I gotta say that this neutralizer did no more than plain water did. I also made the standard baking soda/water homemade neutralizer, and I think that worked a lot better than this.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle of this I purchased over a year ago is still in my bathroom, 3/4 full.</li>
    <li> Easy application after acid peel.</li>
    <li> I received my order in 2 days.  Included was a very generous sample of glycolic/lactic peel!  Both were excellent leaving baby soft smooth skin.  Will definitely purchase from Cellbone again.</li>
    <li> I have used other products like this in the past and find this one superio. Some burning after application but great results</li>
    <li> I wanted to get the stronger strength first, but everybodys reviews said to start with a low strength.  It is smoothing out the skin, but a stronger strength, I know will help give me a small peel.  What I want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product 3 times after 3 chemical peel applications, and it immediately neutralizes as it states it would, and the burning ceases. I prefer to use then rather than than baking soda/water mixture which is a bit messy. Just apply with a cotton pad, and it&#x27;s done. I have barely put a dent in the bottle, so I expect it to last a pretty good while. Worth the $10 investment!</li>
    <li> I am using this product after using glycolic peel and acid peel. It does calm my skin and refresh it. The company provides step by stem guideline how to use this product. Straightforward and simple. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
    <li> Although this product fulfilled it&#x27;s purpose which is to halt the effects of the glycolic peel and help soothe your skin, there really is no reason to use it unless you have sensitive skin. I have medium skin (not sensitive) and used tap water to remove the peel with no residue and no continuing stinging from the peel.</li>
    <li> Fantastic neutralizer to minimize redness and burning post peel.  I used this after rinsing off the Cellbone 35% glycolic/lactic peel that I received as a sample with this neutralizer and it instantly soothed my face.  I put some B5 Hyaluronic acid serum all over my face afterwards and went to bed.  I awoke with beautiful glowing skin, with no redness whatsoever.  Please sell the full version of the Cellbone 35% glycolic/lactic peel!  That product is incredible!</li>
    <li> I had a HQ+ peel, and this neutralizer neutralized the itching pain in just a few seconds, while water just made it (the peel) seem even itchier. I WOULD recommend this product to anyone getting a peel. Plus, the seller seems to appreciate customers. I received a discount card and a sample glycolic acid peel.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!! THEY EVEN SENT A FREE CHEMICAL PEEL WITH IT, HOW MUCH BETTER CAN IT GET!!! AND THE PEEL WAS FANTASTIC!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best neutralizer on the market.  The only thing is you need to read directions on their website which say to leave on 4 to 6 minutes before rinsing.  The directions on the bottle are a little different.  I would not do an acid peel without this product!</li>
    <li> I ordered  the Neutralizer which I use with 35% Glycolic-Lactic Serum, and I am very pleased with both products. They included samples of products which I liked and will order in the future. Cellbone ships very quickly.</li>
    <li> As far as stopping your face from tingling right after a peel, it does its job. However, I don&#x27;t see how it is any different from water. I am not a chemist so perhaps there is a benefit on a molecular level that I am not able to understand or see/feel. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because technically it does what it advertised to do but I think it is unnecessary and I won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
    <li> it cools the skin, and makes it feel moiustrized and less tense after a harsh chemical peel. Much better than skin moiustrizers which may feel uncomfortable or a little greasy after a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Before I bought this product, I would have a bi-weekly peels. Since my skin is fairly thick, I would administer onto my face using 50-70% Glycolic Acid to get the optimum effect. The sensation it would leave behind is unbearable, even when rinsed in cold water. I finally did some research online on ways to minimize the lingering effect of chemical peels and stumbled onto this neutralizer. Like any skeptic customer, I was quite hesitant on the seller&#x27;s claim: \\&quot;helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe effective neutralization after peeling.\\&quot; Adding to the skepticism, I was reading a few of the other reviewer&#x27;s posts to see if their anguish and experience were relate-able. Pretty convincing stuff, but some reviewers gave me that iffy feeling considering they only have one or two reviews in their profile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After so many days contemplating, I realized that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I made the decision to purchase this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From experience, this product not only has a soothing effect, but it helps offset any traces of acid left in your face. Also, this saves you time during the healing process. I find this a definite plus since I hate being cooped up in the house for days. For me, the longest I ever had to wait before interacting with people was a day without them noticing. But normally, my face would return to its original color within several hours. Just with the Glycolic Acid alone would have left my face noticeably scorched for 2-3 days -- similar case when Samantha from &#x27;Sex and the City&#x27; consulted with her dermatologist and tried a chemical peel; idk if you&#x27;ve seen that episode, but that&#x27;s the best illustrated reference I can think of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are fairly new to this experience, I highly suggest applying during the weekend; allow your skin to heal before returning to work or direct contact with people. Remember to apply with UV moisturizer liberally to avoid scarring and speed the healing process.</li>
    <li> Bought this in conjunction with their glycolic peel and Prep. I&#x27;m not sure this particular product does a whole lot, but it&#x27;s better to be safe than sorry when applying acid to your face. I&#x27;m devoted to the peels and using the Prep weekly. They are a great company and have fantastic products and offer premium (1oz)samples with each order. My adult-onset cystic acne has been drastically improved, if not entirely eliminated (as long as I stick to my regimen of weekly peels and 2x daily use of Prep.) Worth every penny and then some.</li>
    <li> Water alone was not enough for me but both this and water helped.  Boy my biscuits (cheeks) were burning!!!  But it was all good.</li>
    <li> Cellbone sells good products and I am a believer. They also have good customer service. I bought this neutralizer along with the 50% Glycolic Peel -- this is what I wrote about the peel:     This is stronger and better than the expensive peels you can buy in Sephora. Not only do I love this product and it makes my face smoother, but the vendor sent me free samples of other products that I like very much. In short, this company has me hooked. As a military service member, they also gave me a discount card for my next purchase. Little things like that mean a lot.    Now, those who have dry spots, consider using the peel less frequently on those areas. For instance, my cheeks and cheekbone area simply do not need frequent peeling, so I do a t-zone peel and avoid the areas of my face that don&#x27;t need it as often.</li>
    <li> WORKS VERY WELL, STOPS THE BURNING SENSATION IN SECONDS</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  I have used this twice in one week and will continue to use it until my acne scars are gone completely.  I will definitely buy this and recommend this to friends and family.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s marketed for post-peel but I would use it as a daily toner for dry skin.  It contains lots of soothing ingredients for dry skin.  I did use it after my peel and it helped the itching.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product.  It smells good, feels good, etc.  But Whatever you do, do not confuse this product with something that can neutralize Glycolic acid at 30% or higher.  herbs and botanicals are nice and all, but when you are dealing with acids, it comes down to basic chemistry and that does not change.  Use baking soda to neutralize the acid!!!! then, if you want, use this product as a nice toner or skin calmer the next day when redness appears.  This product will not neutralize higher acid concentrations... it&#x27;s all in the chemistry.</li>
    <li> Does not work as described.</li>
    <li> I use this along with my regular routine. It&#x27;s all a part of the correct way to do a peel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using SALICYLIC Acid 30% Skin Chemical Peel after i washed it with cold water, my skin still was lil bit tingling. after i used this, this feeling was actually gone and my skin is back to normal.</li>
    <li> Great product, works as specified</li>
    <li> Made my skin feel kind of oily. I gave it 3 stars because it works, but I find that lots of very cold water works better and doesn&#x27;t leave a gross feeling on my face. I&#x27;d recommend saving your money and using water.</li>
    <li> The product and the packaging is easy to use and store. It&#x27;s worth the money and I will likely bring returning business to this company/manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This is fabulous. Its the perfect product to use after a peel.</li>
    <li> I bought the neutralizer to use after my peels (of course), but I was pleasantly surprised by the extra items that were in my package! I received the 35% Glycolic-Lactic Acid Peel and the Collagen Facial Cleansing Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this 3 stars because I haven&#x27;t actually tried the product yet. I will edit this once I test this out.</li>
    <li> I bought this Neutralizer to use with Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel, 30ml by skin laboratory and it always makes my skin feel refreshed. I dab it on my face after I wash my peel off with cold water, then rinse it off and pat day my face. Leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh, and like new.</li>
    <li> It is true that some do not think it is necessary;  but I am so glad to have this product.  When timing is up for my peel I apply on gauze and dab on face.  This instantly stops the pain.  I then rinse.  I use other cellbone products and I am very very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a very soothing neutralizer that I use right after a chemical peel. Sometimes my skin gets irritated by Retin-A &amp; I use this to help soothe my skin after Retin-A.</li>
    <li> i bought this neutralizer for use as after toner for peels. i have started to use this almost every day</li>
    <li> accidently posted 1 star by mistake. This is nice to have after burning sensation from glycolic peel!</li>
    <li> When I received this product, most of the contents had seeped out all over the inside packaging, really disappointing because you don&#x27;t know how much of the product you will actually need to use.</li>
    <li> Great customer service and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was happily surprised that this did come with a small bottle of 35% Glycolic Peel (sp?) that I did consider buying...now I&#x27;ve got it to try out for free! I&#x27;ll leave more detail as soon as I try this out, I&#x27;ve never done any kind of peel before and I thought this would be a safe buy in case I do need it.  I&#x27;ve read other comments that say you don&#x27;t need it, but I&#x27;d rather be safe than have my face completely melt off....hehe!</li>
    <li> My skin requires chemical peels.  This product does the trick in terms of stopping the burning and chemical reaction.  However, this product feels slimy on my face and I&#x27;m scared its blocking my pores.  I will be ordering from a new company next time.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I bought this when I bought a Salic acid face peel! My face was on fire..water does not help but this does! Whew! Great buy for home peels!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product on the 12th of December &amp; received it on the 16th, which was great timing. Although I expected to only get the neutralizer, I was pleasantly surprised when Cellbone included a 35% glycolic acid peel. Upon receiving this package, I torn into it, read the directions and proceeded to use it. Although I hate to admit it, I know that it will take some time to really see the results because I have neglected my skin for years due to the fact that there are so many products/procedures that are not recommended for my dark brown complected african american skin. Once again, I&#x27;m pleased with the delivery time, the bonus 35% glycolic peel as well as the effectiveness of the neutralizer, but have yet to give a full review of the system as a whole.</li>
    <li> very nice product, it smells wonderful and seems to keep your skin from being so red after a peel.</li>
    <li> This is a great product,especially if your someone who use chemical peels, which I do. The Neutralizer cooled my skin immediately following my Peel, and it also moisturizer my skin. An added bonus was the free sample of 35% lactic acid that I receiced, which I love. This product arrived 2 days after I made my order, which was a nice surprise. All in all I&#x27;m pleasantry surprised and will be purchasing this product along with the Lactic Acid in the future.</li>
    <li> I didnt want to pay an arm and a leg for a professional peel,so i took matters into my own hands and ordered the HQ peel and this neutralizer from Amazon and the cellbone people gave me a sample of their glycolic peel for free!!  You can feel this soothing the skin after an intense 4-6 mins of a light burning sensation.  Would most definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what this would be like, but upon using it after my microderabrasion, I was pleased that a little goes a long way, it is soothing and the price is excellent. They even included a generous sample of a Vit. C peel mask. Glad I purchased it, this seems to be even good for over stimulated skin to calm redness etc.</li>
    <li> I like this product. My peel did not say you needed neutralizer, it stated you could just rinse with cold water but I found this worked well. I received a sample peel with this order that I like much better than the one I ordered.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a pH balancer to use post peel.  Prior to using this product, I didn&#x27;t realize what I was missing out on! I began using at home peels approximately one year ago &amp; always did a cold water rinse on my skin afterward and then moisturized.  I came across this product on here &amp; decided to give it a try.  I was very optimistic because I didn&#x27;t see a huge benefit but thought &amp;#34; hey, if it helps then great, if not oh well&amp;#34;.  The first time I used it, I didn&#x27;t notice anything special (probably due to the fact that I did a very quick peel due to time limitations)....BUT the second time I quickly reaped the benefits!  I had gotten use to the post peel sting that lasts a little while after rinsing but this stuff quickly stops that &amp; helps calm my skin.  What a relief!  I always have this ready (use a cotton ball/pad) to apply immediately post peel!</li>
    <li> So far this rating is for customer service, I will update as soon as I use the product and adjust stars accordingly! But let me Just tell you, so far I am super impressed with this company! I placed my order on Sunday (evening) and my estimated time of delivery was a full 9 days later... well I just got it yesterday (3 days later)! I checked the tracking on it too, just to see if it was coming from a facility close by and it wasn&#x27;t. So that&#x27;s pretty impressive! Not to mention, they included a pretty decent size FREE 35% peel in my package! I wish I would have known because along with this order, I ordered a peel from another company that I&#x27;m expecting to use this product with! I also received a 15% off next purchase coupon in my package too! Ive ordered many things off amazon from many different companies and so far, this is the best company I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of dealing with! Now I just hope the product meets me my expectations! I will update as soon as try it!</li>
    <li> Really cooled my face &amp; went on smoothly.</li>
    <li> Rate this a 5 star because it works great. Also this is a great Neutralizer for anyone! Received in a few days and was packaged where there was no damage. I used this with a 35% glycolic peel.</li>
    <li> This is a very good, soothing post-peel neutralizer that also moisturizes the skin a bit.  I do the occasional at-home peel and this helps to calm the skin down afterwards.  Very good value for the price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Neutralizer for the sole purpose of using AFTER a 20% Salicylic Acid Peel. I could not be happier with the way it soothes and calms my skin after a peel. Some neutralizers can cause breakouts because they are too heavy-I can honestly say I have had no issues with breakouts brought on by this product. It splashes very clear and clean, while clearing the residue from the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is I find I have to use a lot of it-more so than other neutralizers. Additionally-I do not see a use for it other than using after a peel, where as some neutralizers double as a cleansing water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that needs a neutralizer after a peel-but other than that I do not think there is much use for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin type: 20-something, acne-prone, sensitive, semi-pigmented, pale, few-lines</li>
    <li> I purchased this neutralizer to use after using salicylic acid and glycolic acid peels.  I was on the fence when trying to decide to buy this or not, but, thought since this would be my first time using at home peels I should get it just in case.  I am SO glad I did.  I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin, but, after using the peel it felt like I had ants all over my face!  Once I used the neutralizer the stinging stopped almost immediately.  So if you&#x27;re considering peels, you NEED this product.</li>
    <li> If you are doing a peel....GET THIS!  Trust me, you&#x27;ll want to stop the burn/stinging and this does the trick if your skin is sensitive or dry.  Maybe not everyone needs it but I sure did and glad I had it ready to go after my first peel application.</li>
    <li> have to say that this neutralizer works very well..., really does take the sting out after using the skin peels.  I love Cellbone products and am hooked !!  Very reasonable prices plus they give freebies and they are generous size freebies !!!  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Made my skin immediately come back to an affordable ph balance sheet doing lactic acid, glycolic acid peels, thank you...</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly. I love it and use it after my weekly Glycolic peels at home to neutralizer afterwards. It also feels refreshing. One bottle goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This product works! It does feel oily;however,it is suppose to be washed off after the burning stops.  The effects of neutralizer were immediate. I do recommend leaving on for a minimum of two minutes, for deeper penetration and more soothing effects.  I would not do any chemical peel without it.</li>
    <li> Works great and had an added bonus!  Not expected but much appreciated.  Thank you Cellbone!  I&#x27;ll do business with you again.</li>
    <li> I was using the product on a regular basis and was seeing results. Now the brown sun spots have spread very badly and become even more visible than before.  I just paid attention and have to go back to regular use until I can clear them up again.</li>
    <li> I used this after a 30% glycolic peel and my skin felt amazing. Don&#x27;t skim and use baking soda and water like some have stated. This is your skin! This product has aloe in it, and you could tell the difference. The consistency is thick like aloe and feels great after the peel--instantly neutralized. I will buy again no problem.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been permanently scarred by this product! Do not use its to strong even for hulks skin I swear!!! I have disgusting scares everywhere I saw my own skin and smelted it as it peeled off my flesh</li>
    <li> Bought this product for use after a home chemical peel. I didn&#x27;t burn or anything and left my face feeling refreshed.  I&#x27;m sure water would have done the same thing, but I wanted to be sure my face was neutralized.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and stops burning sensation after using chemical peel products....a must have.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with the product . I&lt;br /&gt;Have recommended this product to friends and family members. I will order&lt;br /&gt;Again when I have finished the product</li>
    <li> Really no need for this: mix baking soda with water.</li>
    <li> I tried this after my first peel treatment with Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel,even these 2 products are not the same brand but there were not whole lot of choices for the PH balancers on amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;Then I just gave this one a try,this one did neutralize some kind of the acid but didnt help a lot with the burning after peel maybe this was my first time to do the peeling!!Maybe I need try to use the baking soda to neutralize the acid as some other review suggested and see if I can have a better experience!</li>
    <li> It is a good idea to have one of these around if you do at-home chemical peels.  This will stop the chemicals in the peel from continuing to work after you wash off the peel. It&#x27;s a great safety precaution to keep from burning your skin!  The price is  fair.  The service and timing were quite good.  I also purchased the 35% Glycolic-Lactic Acid Peel Serum. It was very effective.  These are the only two products I have purchased from Cellbone so far, and I must say I am pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> Product works great after doing a peel.  What I love about it most besides the fact that it works, is it smells amazing and almost calming.  It really helps sooth the skin!</li>
    <li> After using the TCA Tattoo Acid Peel I use a cotton ball to spread a little Neutralizer Skin pH balance and its instant relief. One moment my skin is pink and tender from the chemical peel and once I apply the Neutralizer my coloring is back to normal and the burn subsides.</li>
    <li> AFTER I USE A CHEMICAL PEEL, THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST FOR MAKING MY FACE MORE COMFORTABLE. IT GETS MY PH BALANCE BACK TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND HELPS PROTECT AND SOOTHE MY SKIN. IT IS A \\&quot;MUST HAVE\\&quot; IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE A CHEMICAL PEEL.</li>
    <li> Nice product I will buy again. It even came with a free sample of glycolic acid peel. Thanks I used it too. It worked great!</li>
    <li> Soft and  gentle on your face after peel and its a large bottle too</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and it cool the skin down when using the peel.I would buy it again. Recommend it to friends</li>
    <li> always stealing photos are placed and prducto works or not is not the same as you order, are stealing ya</li>
    <li> I was happy that i purchased the neutralizer after I bought The Jessner&#x27;s chemical peel set. It did the job nicely. I do reccommend it for anyone.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, makes my face feel great after a microdermabrasion session.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product... I use it sometimes after I do a chemical peel and it provides a soothing finish.  It is not greesy at all!  The key is to use a little, great for the value!</li>
    <li> Love the peels and love this product! Gotta have this neutralizer after your peel for instant relief.</li>
    <li> I purchased this neutralizer for after an Glycolic acid / Lactic Acid Peel by Cellbone.  I do not know that it is doing more than a 60+ second rinse with cool water on this lighter peel solution; however, I used it.  I think that 1 cup of cool water and a tablespoon of baking soda might work just as well to neutralize the peel.    I was very pleased to see a sample of Cellbone&#x27;s glycolic cleanser and a small sample of lactic acid / glycolic acid peel in my order.  I also ordered the prep, which may also be a nice mini peel tonic to be used after one washes their face.  When applied to skin cleaned with Cellbone&#x27;s glycolic cleanser, it has a little sting to it.</li>
    <li> I have tried the GLYCOLIC acid peel from CELLBONE (check out my separate review for that product if you are interested) and have found that using this NEUTRALIZER afterwards calms my skin and seems to HALT the peeling process and SOOTHE my treated skin as it says it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WITHOUT using it (which I have only done once or twice) my skin felt mildly irritated, so while it does not make a HUGE difference, is it more COMFORTABLE to use this product after a PEEL. I would recommend this to follow ANY type of peel as a soothing FINISH.</li>
    <li> All you really need is some baking soda and water. Also the shipping fee on this item is over half the price of the actual item, but it did come with a nice sample peel.It does work and I used it, but for a 30% peel I like the big cotton balls w/ baking soda solution best.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking I would need this a chemical peel. Like a lot of other reviews, when I applied this product it felt no different than applying tap water to my face. I looked at the ingredients and it seems it most likely made of most witch hazel. For some reason witch hazel is not even listed on the actual amazon listing but it&#x27;s on the bottle. Witch hazel is about a dollar or two at the drug store. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this, just mix baking soda and water together instead, it will work much better to neutralize. I just bough a box of baking soda at the store .55 cents, what a steal compare to this junk.</li>
    <li> I did a 35% glycolic peel and was worried about redness and irritation afterwards but using this aPH balancer was great, I was able to put my make upand sun protection and go on with my life, I will purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This neutralizer works very will and eliminates the stinging immediately.</li>
    <li> Great product. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> There is no evidence before or after treatment that this product really works.&lt;br /&gt;I would not purchase this product again</li>
    <li> This product really help after the peel I used. I was both happy and unhappy about the fact that they sent me a free sample of peel I had already bought to use this after. If I&#x27;d known I was getting such a large free sample I wouldnt have bought any! But, the bright side is I wont run out for a long time. I&#x27;m overall happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this after peels, however I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything at all. I don&#x27;t feel any difference when I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
    <li> Like many I have turned to acid peels to remove lines &amp; imperfections.  They work, but they burn like the Dickens.&lt;br /&gt;THIS is the cure. Yes, you should use water, just as the peels say, but this restores the skin&#x27;s normal pH balance and removes the burning completely.  I like to use it after I have done the peel, let it sit, then rinse with water. You don&#x27;t HAVE to rinse it though.&lt;br /&gt;A must-have product for anyone with an acid peel.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent pH balancer which helps to keep muy skin clean and balanced for best effect of other acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;It is now part of my cleaning ritual.</li>
    <li> works pretty good i like it. will be buying again. this stuff really works the way i wanted it to.</li>
    <li> The delivery was super fast and I&#x27;ve got free present!!!!!  The product it self  is very good, the bottle is big,so it will last for long.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse, it is true, do not confuse this product with a neutralizer product. It&#x27;s all about chemistry. You have to stop the chemical burning reaction. Botanicals are nice smelling but useless at stopping the burning chemical reaction. There are special soaps that you can buy made to stop the chemical peel reaction. Baking soda stops also. Be careful.......</li>
    <li> Perfect post peel neutralizer.  Viscosity of the neutralizer makes it easy to apply and very effective.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I am using skin obsession peeling and I bought this neutralizer to be more sufficient instead of making my own with backing soda, i didn&#x27;t pay attention to the $6.99  shipping fee when i was ordering the products but I received 35% peeling small bottle and the company is in Maryland, I love to support US work force. the product is very sufficient and good packing with good amount of liquid it will last for 6 month of consumption .</li>
    <li> I really love this product, It did what it was suppose to do. I applied it after my peeling and it worded immediately.</li>
    <li> This neutralizer was effective in neutralizing my skin after I applied 40% peel solution to my skin.  It is a bit oily but I am satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> What else can you say about Cellbone products?  They are top of the line but at a great price.  The balancer is awesome after peels, etc.  You really can feel the different in which I use as safety precaution after home treatments.  It is a plus and must.</li>
    <li> This feels great after Glycolic on the face.  I wouldn&#x27;t dare put glycolic on my face if I didn&#x27;t have this neutralizer to balance it afterword.  I&#x27;ve read horror stories of women who didn&#x27;t neutralize and ended up frying their faces.  Luckily with this, I never have had a bad experience.</li>
    <li> Feels great on my skin!  Refreshing</li>
    <li> I think if you are going to do a invasive treatment on your skin I would recommend putting the PH back in your skin after treating your skin with any chemical or abrasive material-common sense.</li>
    <li> It quickly takes away the sting from the peel. I am so glad I had this handy! I kept it on for almost 2 minutes before I rinsed it off. I highly recommend it!!!!</li>
    <li> Works good, good service</li>
    <li> I use it along with TCA 15%..  &amp; it is very nice its help me with protecting my skin because I have a hypersensitive skin... Its calms my skin during peeling process.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It instantly soothes and hydrates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I am Happy customer. Would definitely buy once again!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know this type of product existed over the counter. This helped my skin stay radiant after I did the derma peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and it totally works!!!!!  I recomended to everyone!!!! I am  Very happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I left my peel on too long so I&#x27;m not sure if this didn&#x27;t work very well or if my skin is just burned. Will try it again next week and update.</li>
    <li> \\&quot;Wow Grade A Seller!, Lighting Fast Shipping , And They Also Sent Me a Free Sample of The Glycolic-Lactic Acid 35%, I Would Recommend This Seller To All For Great Service\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Should have just used baking soda and water. I really don&#x27;t think this balanced my skin any better. Bought it because I was afraid that the peel might need more assistance than the above.</li>
    <li> This product did not do much. I got better results neutralizing with baking soda. This was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product worked as expected.  I think it is a wise purchase is you are going to do a chemical peel.</li>
    <li> Great for mild astringent, not harsh, have oily, but aging skin.  So dry in spots, this is everyday usable. Wonderful</li>
    <li> This was purchased with Salicylic Skin Chemical Peel 15ml - 30% Skin Chemical Peel and has helped my granddaughters skin look fresh and clear. I was shocked to tell you the truth. She lives 4 hours away at college and had been using it for a little over a month. I ran into this by accident and bought both to see if it would work and her skin looked fresh, small pores. I am glad I purchased it for her and even tho my 70 year old skin has no pimples I would like to try some of both to help with wrinkles. For a child to go through high school and college with acne is hurtful to them, so advertise these products, please. Skin Beauty Solutions - 15ml Roll On Salicylic Acid 30% Skin Chemical Peel.</li>
    <li> This product personally did nothing for me and was a waste of $10. Basically baking soda and water could work just as well.</li>
    <li> I give myself and my teenagers peels at home, this feels great after the peel!   this company is awesome and have bought from them many times, highly recommend!</li>
    <li> After purchasing a glycolic acid peel kit I discovered it wanted me to pour baking soda in a sink of cool water to rinse off peel product. Well THAT would be a mess. Instead I purchased this neutralizer. I just pour it on cotton rounds to remove peeling product then splash on cool water. This product not only makes the whole rinse process fast , easy and less messy but also works wonderfully! I ordered more of Cellbones&#x27; products. Unfortunately their Amazon acct has limited products but their web site has many more. It&#x27;s an excellent product and I highly recommend it. It&#x27;s reasonably priced and shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I used this after exfoliating my skin it helps to balance my skin which is oily I received it on time and packaged good.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle in a bottle! It calms my face after peels like nothing I could have imagined. I won&#x27;t be without a bottle of this ever again.</li>
    <li> This neutralizes the stingy effect of chemical to your skin, peeling chemicals like AHA, glycol acid, etc. It does wonder to skin instead of suffering from stings.</li>
    <li> The lactic acid peel product i was using said to neutralize with water, but using this product worked much better.  The stinging from the peel stopped immediately and felt very soothing.  Bonus - this company sent me a sample product, too.  Shipping was fast, i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Leftover acid residue from the peels will irritate your skin. Use this to neutralize to to reduce redness. Very useful for me.</li>
    <li> Good neutralizer for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Used after lactic acid 50% gel peel.</li>
    <li> Thank you for quick mailing and the extra little gift!</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Does sting a little before it calms the skin down, but it works to stop the chemical peel and soothe the skin fast.</li>
    <li> I use it every time I use glycolic acid on my face. This neutralizer works perfect for me. It is a MUST!</li>
    <li> Baking soda. 50 cents for a year supply &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get much of any result from this product, so wont purchase again.</li>
    <li> you can feel the product working it stings a lil bit but it has been working and came through the mail pretty fast n i am stationed in afghan!</li>
    <li> Worked just as it said it would Used this pH balancer afar doing a chemical peel and it instantly soothed after the peel. This product is essential if you will be putting any type of chemical on your face, and it works great.</li>
    <li> the best stuff really cools skin after a light acid peel</li>
    <li> I use this product after doing a strong peel, and it cools the skin tremendously.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t see much change</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, WORKS FAST.</li>
    <li> With this product I got a free sample of the Cellbone Glycolic-Lactic Acid 35% peel Serum. I was totally surprised. Stuff works. At first it does burn; but I never used this before so I am thinking that is the reason why. I put if on w/the boar brush. The neutraizer skin PH balancer smooths your skin and it does help with any tingling or burn sensation you might have.</li>
    <li> This product does what it claims to do.  Applied after the peel is done, it immediately calms the skin and neutralizes the peel.  Great product !</li>
    <li> THIS IS PART OF THE SYSTEM AND DOES WORK WELL .</li>
    <li> I DID A 25% TCA PEEL TODAY, OMG FELT LIKE MY FACE WAS ON FIRE! WATER DID NOT HELP AT THE RINSE PROCESS WITH ANY OF THE BURNING! the neutralizer was wonderful. it totally helped. i dont think i would do another peel if i did not have this neutralizer!  seriously, it is a must have!</li>
    <li> I like this...it \\&quot;calms\\&quot; my face after a peel...which I&#x27;ve only been doing for about a week and a half. It says to wash it off with water...but i keep it on after my peel.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product to use in conjuction with the glycolic acid peel. However, due to delivery problems, it arrived several weeks after the glycolic peel solution.  In the meanwhile, I used the glycolic peel solution alone and washed my face immediately after application.    I used the neutralizer the next time I used the glycolic acid and really appreciated no difference.</li>
    <li> I thought I could use neutralizing soaps and lots of water--but this product stops the action of the acid immediately and have had much less post peel redness.  I put a little on the corner of a damp washcloth and after rinsing my face in shower, I go over my entire face with the edge of the cloth. That is it and the end of unexpected redness. Plus I also got a free gift of a small bottle of a peel. Nice touch.</li>
    <li> The product complies completely with the offer. My wife is happy with it and she will purchase again when required.</li>
    <li> I rather chosen this instead of the Baking Powder that other recommended since its portable plus it doesn&#x27;t require too much of it to do the job. I already did about three chemical peels and i barely made a dent in it. Cold Water is a nice way to wash this off. Be gentle to your delicate face and don&#x27;t rub too hard with your towel.</li>
    <li> Baking soda in water &#x3D; alkaline solution; will neutralize your treatment (acid) in a second. Don&#x27;t waste money on this!</li>
    <li> This Neutralizer does exactly what the label says. I used a 20% aha peel and after 2 minutes it was burning, I let it sit for 3 minutes, I couldn&#x27;t bare the burning. I rinse with cold water and no relief, I pat dried my face then apply this neutralizer and it immediately stop burning. I love love this product, I will definitely be using this on my husband next time he get a sunburn. If you are planning on doing any peel I highly recommend you get this product and use immediately after rinsing face, it makes a world of difference. Wish they had use this on me when I did a VIPeel a year ago.</li>
    <li> I regularly use a 40 percent Glycolic Acid peel at home.  This neutralizer is a must have.  After using the peel, and rinsing it off, I use this neutralizer.  I apply it to all areas with a cotton ball and it instantly &amp;#34;calms down&amp;#34; the&lt;br /&gt;peeled area.  Makes my skin feel very soft, takes the sting out of the peel.  100 percent difference between doing a&lt;br /&gt;peel using the neutralizer, and doing the peel without using it.  I&#x27;ve ordered it twice, both times received it within 3- days of ordering.</li>
    <li> Is Neutralizer skin pH balancer save for pregnant women??&lt;br /&gt;I used it 3 times with Salicylic Acid 20% Gel Peel and Iam pregnant in first month, now I am freaking out</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It really does stop any stinging you might feel after a glycolic acid peel.  They also include a nice full sized free sample of their collagen toner, which is really quite good and freebies are always a good thing.  I am happy with this company and their product&#x27;s, I will be back...</li>
    <li> I use this neutralizer after using the 40% glycolic peel. It immediately stops the burning from the acid. I also had baking soda mixed with water nearby as the MD that did my peels professionally recommended that. The baking soda made my skin burn more. I don&#x27;t know why. The only reason I can think of is because it wasn&#x27;t completely dissolved and the pieces that weren&#x27;t disolved scraped my skin. But it did feel like burning. It is a clear liquid that has aloe in it so it coats the skin. Ingredients listed on the bottle are: water, aloe vera leaf juice, willow bark, cucumber flower extract, witch hazel, sodium hyaluronate, centella asiatica, sodium lactate. If I remember my chemistry you need a base to counteract the acid of the glycolic peel. Sodium lactate is the salt of weak acid it acts as a weak base. Although this product is composed of mostly herbal products it did work well for me. The bottle contains 4 fluid ounces. That is enough neutralizer to last for many, many uses.</li>
    <li> This works and i am glad that i brought it! I recommend it. It does calm and cool the skin.</li>
    <li> After purchasing the TCA Peel I noticed that I didn&#x27;t need this at all. I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference after applying it after the peel.</li>
    <li> Great product, very soothing easy to use too much. I would recommend washing the acid off with water first and then using a small amount to do a final neutralization.</li>
    <li> Smooth silky application and minimizes burn immediately.  It&#x27;s better than cold water and baking soda splashed on your face to subdue the glycolic acid peel.</li>
    <li> Good stuff to use after an acid gel peel.  It keeps me from feeling the burn that the acid invokes.</li>
    <li> Works as described, takes away the burning feeling &#x3D;)  Big bottle for a small price, directions easy to understand, thanks again:)</li>
    <li> I have used this product 3 times now with the Skin Obsession Jessner&#x27;s Chemical Peel Kit Anti-aging and Anti-acne Skin that Amazon sells. I would not be without it. It works instantly and perfectly, and takes very little. I just can&#x27;t see standing at the sink for 2 minutes and rinsing my face till it stops burning. A waste of water... and my patience. If you do peels, I&#x27;d say Get This. If you have acne, it is good for after cleansing too. If you are prone to oily skin, just rinse if off after. You will still balance the pH.</li>
    <li> Cellbone Technology is a great product! I use it often and many of their products! Cellbone Technology is a great product! I use it often and many of their products!</li>
    <li> Neutralizer did help after my facial acid treatment but I did feel a slight tingling afterwards sometimes for a day.</li>
    <li> it isn&#x27;t strong on my skin and definitely a good product! I liked it the first time I tried it!</li>
    <li> This was the perfect solution for my needs at the time it worked wonderfully in calming my skin after my peel. I recommend this yes</li>
    <li> I used this after my first facial peel with Salicylic Acid 20%.. well firstly let me say this was my first ever peel so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. I kept it on for 1 minute like the directions explained, rinsed it off with water but still noticed burning. I didn&#x27;t worry because I had purchased this right along with the peel just in case and had it right there handy sitting on the counter. It worked instantly.. stopped burning right away. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 1st at home salicylic acid peel. I read that a salicylic acid peels do not require neutralization because the skin will do that on it&#x27;s own. Since I hadn&#x27;t done a peel before, I wanted to make sure I had this on hand just in case. After applying the acid peel, I was only able to stand the sting of the acid for several seconds. I was so glad to have this on hand to eliminate the stinging of the peel and effectively stop the acid from continuing. Worked eminently, smoothed my stinging skin. I heard that baking soda and water could do just the same. But I&#x27;d rather not have to deal with making my own solution and figuring out the right balance between the 2 ingredients. Besides that, this is reasonably priced enough that I don&#x27;t have to consider making my own neutralizer.</li>
    <li> I find that this is super useful. I bought a gel peel and read the reviews that you can use water instead of the neutralizer, but I thought to myself I am not going to risk it, it is my face we are talking about here. So I bought and I am happy I did.  I found my skin was a bit more sensitive then what i thought. My skin is a bit on the oily side if that helps anyone. I am totally buying this once I run out of the product.</li>
    <li> bought this not realizing what I had purchased!!! Thought it was an addition to the microderm abrasion unit I purchased....I was so excited when I figured it out!!!! It came with a small bottle of &amp;#34;Home Chemical peel&amp;#34; I am now addicted!!!</li>
    <li> I have folliculitis on my arms and bought a glycolic acid peel to help with scars and post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. This is a skin soothing neutralizer for acid peels but has a number of antiseptic/anti-inflammatory ingredients so I use this a few times a week for break outs. It helps even out skin tone and improves visually the tone of the skin. It reduced my pores, redness and gave my face and skin on my arms a sort of glow.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything on my skin after applying and rinsing off TCA.  Skin still burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tested this neutralizer.  I poured 1 tsp of 50% TCA (trichloroacetic acid) into a small bowl and checked it with pH test strips.  The strip turned bright red as expected, indicating pH of 1.  I then poured in 1 tsp of Cellbone neutralizer and it did nothing.  I retested with a fresh pH strip and it turned bright red again with their neutralizer in the solution.  I poured more neutralizer into the bowl and still the same.  It only neutralized when I measured in a teaspoon of baking soda.  It then bubbled up, I tested it with a new strip, and it was neutralized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I tried it with 30% glycolic acid with a pH of 2.  The neutralizer changed it from 2 to 4, which is still acidic.  I poured twice the amount of neutralizer as glycolic acid. On the pH scale of 1-12 water is 7...  4 is acidic.</li>
    <li> This was a great product it is perfect for chemical masks. It cools it straight down. Plus it gives you what you need to put back on your skin after the peel.</li>
    <li> Calms the skin after the salicylic peel, but smells kind of weird and is a little greasy feeling...not too much....i&#x27;d say its ok as its a calming affect but I feel that any toner with out alcohol in it will do just fine!!!</li>
    <li> Neutralizer is an important step in any glycolic peel and if this is your first time, use this solution. It works to stop the peel so it doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, water alone won&#x27;t stop it. If you&#x27;re experienced, you know a baking soda solution is neutralizer as well and can be made for a penny. I think this product is too pricey for what it actually does.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get  my product</li>
    <li> this cools your face after a chemical peel. i wouldn&#x27;t do a peel without this to follow. it works quickly and worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> Fair price and quick delivery. I have yet to try this product. It came will a good recommendation. I look forward to getting the results that were written.</li>
    <li> This is a great product I would order this produt again. Very pleased with the neutralizer. I will tell my friends to order this product.</li>
    <li> A must with the glyco peel...and soooo soothing. Highly recommended with the peel and as part of a beauty regimen! delivery was prompt too.</li>
    <li> Great product. Hubby and m daughter use it after the microdermabrasion machine. It keeps the face nice and smooth. I highly recommend it</li>
    <li> This neutralizer is a must have if you do any type of a facial peel.  Very effective and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Worked Great to neutralize those strong glycolic acid peels.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really say it was great or it wasn&#x27;t.  Not sure if it even worked like it stated.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product to accompany my Glyco-Lac peel thinking it would neutralize my acidic peel. It is a gel so I had to still try to wash off the gel as well as rinse my face to soothe the peel itself. Cellbone did not create this product to neutralize an acidic peel because it does nothing of the sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need to neutralize your acidic pH peel use a basic pH product like baking soda mixed with water. It&#x27;s simple chemistry a base+acid&#x3D;neutral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
    <li> It burned my skin real bad and I only left it on for 5 min. Like the instructions said and it left scars</li>
    <li> I did not need this since I returned the glycolic acid. It annoys me that I wasted money on postage.</li>
    <li> as the title says, this does work but it feels somewhat oily on your skin so if you have acne prone skin (such as myself), I wouldn&#x27;t advise this. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t need it anyway, washing my face with cold water after a peel, works just fine</li>
    <li> I started with having peels done at a salon and decided I&#x27;d rather do them at home. I felt I need a ph balancer for the skin after the peel and this is the one I chose. So far I&#x27;m very happy with the results and feel it&#x27;s doing just what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The prices for the items I bought are very acceptable and the quality is just as good as what I was paying high dollar to achieve.  I would recommed this product if you do peels at home.</li>
    <li> this product was great after a diamond microdermabrasion treatment i did on me and my husband.it is defendly a five.</li>
    <li> when i did my first  gyicolic 35 peel, it sting a bit but as soon as i finish my 4 minutes, i apply the neutralizer skin PH and amazing my sting sensation left, i will buy this product again, love it</li>
    <li> this came together and it is supposed to be used in conjunction with 20% Pure Medical Grade Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA Peel). together the products do a good job in keeping yje skin looking new after peeling. I suggest you to read the 20% Pure Medical Grade Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA Peel) reviews.</li>
    <li> WIFE BOUGHT  THIS AND HAS TOLD ME THAT IT HAS WORKED FOR HER. NO PROBLEMS OR COMPLAINTS THAT I KNOW.</li>
    <li> This serum is a must for thos who use glycolic- and other- acid facial peel formuli! I can guarantee that when you&#x27;re finaly ready to remove the acid, this product works instantly and amazingly. The burn stops immediately!</li>
    <li> Great product. Did what it claims.</li>
    <li> smells lovely &amp; fresh. I use this after a glycolic acid peel and it leaves my skin so soft and smelling good. I would buy again but damn I still have some hah it lasts a while</li>
    <li> Instantly relieves any burning sensation from glycolic acid peels.</li>
    <li> I put it on after I used the Hydroquinone Serum, but it did not do anything.  I will never buy it again.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t think this is much better than using water.  I don&#x27;t think it was worth buying.  I good rinse with water is just as good.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all. I haven&#x27;t tried any others because I was so very disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> Did a good job neutralizing the TCA 15% that i used. I used it for about 3 minutes after the peel. Stinging did not immediately stop, it stopped about 30 minutes later.</li>
    <li> This product is great. It smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;I love how gentel it is and it does not dry my skin out.</li>
    <li> I t may work but water alone is a great balancer after a peel.  I do not think this product is necessary.</li>
    <li> I use this product after I use IQ glycol acid. It really works good to neutralize the skin and stop the burning from the chemical peel. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it leaves the skin feeling tacky to the touch. I will probably continue to use it because it does do the job it was intended for.</li>
    <li> I used it once a week. I can see how it removes dirt from my face and neck. I enjoy it.</li>
    <li> works for peels. Just a little pricey. I will prob look for something similar but less expensive.</li>
    <li> careful putting things on face. This helped after using the acid.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this is great, but I didn&#x27;t really need to use it much, and I used the lactic acid peels. I bought this to be on the safe side since I have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> WOW...what a rip off! You create HEAT when you mix a base (baking soda) and an acid (TCA, glycolic acid, etc)! Non-professional trying to make money off of selling a worthless or even damaging product!</li>
    <li> This is perfect to use while your skin is recovering from a peel.  It&#x27;s like a &amp;#34;OVERS&amp;#34;, and restores your skin back to it&#x27;s pre-peel condition or in my case to a much better condition.</li>
    <li> Did the job of cooling skin after a peel</li>
    <li> This is a must have if you use facial acid peels. A lot of customers have no problem with using the baking soda method post peel but this is so much less messy and works great. It does burn a little but that&#x27;s normal since it&#x27;s neutralizing the acid but a quick rinse of your face with cold water and it&#x27;s gone.</li>
    <li> My wife used it with her Diamond Microdermabrasion Portable Machine NEW SPA HOME Skin Care Kit</li>
    <li> I use this after every peel. I love it. It has really great ingredients to help your skin after you do a peel.</li>
    <li> After my glycolic peel I used the neutralizer skin PH balancer. I used it right after I neutralized my face with baking soda water. It left my face extra soft and moisturized. It was not sticky or heavy and dried pretty quickly. Good stuff. I will buy more when I finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. All the chemical peels that I had done and trust there have been many I found that cold water not only refreshed my skin better but helped with the longer effects. This was a waste of money. All the peels I use which is glycolic and salycylic (sp) which work great are better washed off I think with cold water. When I used this I could not even tell if I had actullay got all the peel off or what was going on. And there is no way to test it out until you are ready to remove a peel which if you have had sat with acid eating away at your skin (which is what peels are designed to do_ then the last thing you want to do is experiment with something and for me it did not work. I ended up rinsing with cold water. Which helped to soothe my skin and not damage the effects of the peel.</li>
    <li> well i just use it 2 times already it look like its works but i still need to give it more time still.</li>
    <li> Great for after a peel. Really helps soothe the skin.</li>
    <li> Stops the sting of a acid peel in seconds! when I&#x27;m out i will definitely reorder this product! Love it!</li>
    <li> I  BOUGHT  THIS  PRODUCT  ABOUT  A  WEEK  AGO,  AND  I  ABSOLUTELY  LOVE  IT  !  THIS  BIG  BOTTLE  IS  FABULOUS  AND  DOES  COOL  YOUR  PAIN  DOWN  ALOT  ,  AND  IF  YOU  DO EXPERIENCE   A   CHEMICAL  PEEL,  AS  I  DID  NOT  AS  YET   DO ONE,   BUT  I  DID  EXPERIENCE  SOME  BURNING  AFTER  SKIN  BEGAN  PEELING  ON  MY  FACE  AFTER  3  DAYS  AFTER  USING  TRETONIC  A,  THAT  IS  SOME  POWERFUL  STUFF,  AND  YOUR  SKIN  WILL  BEGAN  TO  PEEL,  SO  THIS  HELPED  ME  TO  SURVIVE ,  HA HA .  WHATEVER  IS  IN  CELLBONE  TECHNOLOGY,  ITS  VERY  GOOD.  EXCELLENT,  AND  THEY  GAVE  ME  A  FREE  SAMPLE  OF  35 %  GLYCOLIC,  THAT  WAS  A  NICE  GESTURE  BY  THEM,  SMILE,  THANK  YOU  CELLBONE.  WORTH  EVERY  PENNY.</li>
    <li> I would never to a peel without it.It is worth the extra  money to use with the peel. I will buy it again</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference. I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> Nice even though you can make your own neutralizer at home.</li>
    <li> This was nothing more than water. Don&#x27;t be fooled!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it in order to neutralize a peel after I do them at home. Works great!</li>
    <li> nothing special does what its suppose to do i would recommend this or anyone that is cheaper, seems they all do the what they are suppose to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impress. Nothing happened either way.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> Thank you for fast, courteous service and the free gift! That was a wonderful surprise and nice touch!  The product worked well as well. Thank you again!</li>
    <li> Really takes the sting out quickly after using the glycolic acid on my face.</li>
    <li> The product did the job just fine.  No probs.  I am pretty impressed with the results.  I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> THIS NEUTRALIZER WAS OK,  BUT I WILL STICK WITH THE OLD FASHION REMEDY WATER AND BAKING SODA. I DID GO BACK AND FORTH WITH BOTH  PRODUCT UNTILL MY FACE  SUBSIDE  AFTER MY PEEL. (SOFT PAT AROUND FACE FOR 20+MINS)</li>
    <li> this really made the peel effects tolerable.did a few mini peels and still have plenty left .i also have been using it after exfoliating type scrubs.would order again</li>
    <li> Be careful. Don&#x27;t try to do a peel yourself. Some of these products are too strong for most people. Saw it on Dr. Oz. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I had acne and skin problems.  After using this product my skin is glowing. My acne has cleared up, now I&#x27;m working on getting rid of the scars.</li>
    <li> It came sooner than i expected.It was my first time using this kind of product and it was perfect for my glycolic peeling kit at home.</li>
    <li> This was a good product, but I will not re-order. I useit after my chemical peel, but have found no difference weather(?) I use it or not...</li>
    <li> a very good choice ,i would recommend it to anyone,am loving my new clear skin..i just hope it will keep up.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Very soothing after a peel.</li>
    <li> This is a fine product, but I found out that a solution of baking soda and cool water has the same or better effect for my skin.</li>
    <li> This works very well to neutralize any of the mild in-home acid peels. Makes your face feel so smooth and clean</li>
    <li> Love this product and the seller (cellbone Technology).  The product is a perfect balance for after at home skin peel.  This will save me loads!!! the instructions on how to use are on their website and they are easy to follow.  I am pleased with the product.  Service: the product arrived earlier than expected and came with a free gift from the seller.  Outstanding service,.</li>
    <li> I like this product so far and am happy with it. This is a good product to use with any facial peels.</li>
