### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Good product!  </li>
      <li>Great procut for bath time</li>
      <li>Kids have a habit of licking and tasting things, even when they don&#x27;t taste that great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about how good the soap is to wash him</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s great, and it easily washes off.</li>
      <li>These smell great, and they are so much fun in the bathtub, and my daughter loves them.</li>
      <li>but mostly because she loves crayons.  </li>
      <li>so I assumed they would be safe on his body.</li>
      <li>The bath crayons are much better.</li>
      <li>Kids enjoyed them.</li>
      <li>If my 3 year old were writing this, she would stay they are great, and give the product 5 stars.</li>
      <li>I purchased these for my grandbabies (twins, 2 years old) to play with in the bathtub and they love them!!</li>
      <li>Once I rinsed them off, they were fine.</li>
      <li>Very fun and easy to use.</li>
      <li>these are just containers of (lightly) colored shower gel.</li>
      <li>They are the equivalent of putting any lightly colored bath wash in a tube.</li>
      <li>product is good, but will last maybe 2 baths</li>
      <li>I would be willing to bet (money, not my baby&#x27;s health) that if my girl bathed in this product she would for sure be going to the doctor in 3 days with a UTI or yeast infection no matter how much we rinsed her off with soap free water.</li>
      <li>These would probably be good for an older child but not for a 2.5 year old.</li>
      <li>The gels are well pigmented, very washable, and lightly fruit-scented.</li>
      <li>but he enjoyed squirting...until he got some directly in the eye.</li>
      <li>They are not as fun as they look.</li>
      <li>NON of my pens had any color in them, they were just filled with smelly clear soap.  </li>
      <li>Also, the colors were really off!</li>
      <li>My daughter got her first UTI two days after using this product.</li>
      <li>While my son likes to draw on the tub surround with them, he also enjoys coloring on the included washcloth which has an underwater scene, with several cute fish, printed on it.</li>
      <li>I have enjoyed these for a long time.  </li>
      <li>The gels /are/ more runny, so we&#x27;ve been surprised the kid has been able to make them last these past 2 weeks :) They&#x27;ll be his go-to bath toy until the gels are completely gone!</li>
      <li>spend my money on real bath crayons.</li>
      <li>Very transparent colored gel.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do much</li>
      <li>The texture of the contents is a very runny liquid rather than a gel so needless&lt;</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am not keen on these because each of these soaps smells so much like candy.</li>
      <li>My 3 year old loves these, but goes through them WAY too fast.  </li>
      <li>They barely colored in the first place.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick</li>
      <li>All the other colors were so light as to be invisible.</li>
      <li>, well they are very sensitive to fragrances and chemicals.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old loves these pens!</li>
      <li>The gel is runny, so not so easy to write with and the &#x27;pens&#x27; we got are a little leaky</li>
      <li>/&gt;Stick with the hard soap crayons if you want your child to actually be able to DRAW with something in the bathtub.</li>
      <li>My two year old did like them</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;write&amp;#34; on anything/one like you could with a solid stick of washable color (i.e. colored bar soap).</li>
      <li>and they are completely done.</li>
      <li>These gels provide the fun of fingerpainting without the mess.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought these thinking my son would like to draw on himself in the bath.  They were advertised as body crayons so I assumed they would be safe on his body. We started playing and the water-like gel was squirting all over which wasn&#x27;t like other bath crayons we had used but he enjoyed squirting...until he got some directly in the eye. His eye was burning for thirty minutes as I frantically called Poison Control and was directed to flush it out under cold water for 15 minutes. My son, my husband and myself are so traumatized by these stupid crayons. Why make a product designed for the body that burns children?</li>
    <li> These are just liquid soap!  The back of the package says, \\&quot;Kids can use Bathtub Body Doodlers to color on tub walls or their bodies.\\&quot;  That just isn&#x27;t possible with this product.  My boys were really looking forward to using these &amp; were really disappointed when they found out how they actually worked.  They couldn&#x27;t \\&quot;draw\\&quot; with them in any way, and they used them up in 1 bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick with the hard soap crayons if you want your child to actually be able to DRAW with something in the bathtub.</li>
    <li> Only giving a star because I have to. These are horrible! Once child accidentally got a mouthful of gel and has been gagging and coughing since. The other kid came out from the bath itching from head to toe. They barely colored in the first place. Not worth the headache these caused!</li>
    <li> He uses them to play with in the tub. I don&#x27;t know about how good the soap is to wash him but he&#x27;s never had a skin problem from playing with these soaps.</li>
    <li> If my 3 year old were writing this, she would stay they are great, and give the product 5 stars. However, even she has giving up trying to write with them. You can&#x27;t. It is just bath gel in a crayon shape. When you squeeze it out it just becomes a big gloop on the wall. However my daughter likes to play with the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not keen on these because each of these soaps smells so much like candy. I really am afraid one of the kids might try to taste it. Kids have a habit of licking and tasting things, even when they don&#x27;t taste that great. But these remind me of lollipop or ice pop flavors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great! Nice and thick so it&#x27;s harder to break!</li>
    <li> My 4 year old loves these pens! The gels are well pigmented, very washable, and lightly fruit-scented. While my son likes to draw on the tub surround with them, he also enjoys coloring on the included washcloth which has an underwater scene, with several cute fish, printed on it.

    <li> My daughter got her first UTI two days after using this product. Coincidence? I think not.</li>
    <li> I will admit that I didn&#x27;t read the description too carefully before purchase, was in an Xmas rush....these are just containers of (lightly) colored shower gel. You can&#x27;t really &amp;#34;write&amp;#34; on anything/one like you could with a solid stick of washable color (i.e. colored bar soap). Lame, would not recommend.</li>
    <li> They are not as fun as they look. The bath crayons are much better. The gel is runny, so not so easy to write with and the &#x27;pens&#x27; we got are a little leaky</li>
    <li> The only color that worked well was red.  All the other colors were so light as to be invisible.</li>
    <li> These are terrible. They hurt kids eyes and are impossible to write with.</li>
    <li> These crayons are horrible it&#x27;s just a colored liquid and it doesn&#x27;t do much plus the colors are also horrible wouldnt reccomend!</li>
    <li> These would probably be good for an older child but not for a 2.5 year old. The texture of the contents is a very runny liquid rather than a gel so needless&lt;br /&gt;To say they were gone after about 2 bathes. She squeezed and squeezed. Also, the colors were really off! The orange was yellow and the purple was white which confused my young daughter.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my grandbabies (twins, 2 years old) to play with in the bathtub and they love them!! They \\&quot;color\\&quot; on the tub, the tile, and themselves! It&#x27;s great, and it easily washes off.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t write.  They are just colored bath gel inside a tube.  You squeeze them and soap comes out and runs everywhere.  You couldn&#x27;t even write letters with them, let alone draw.  My two year old did like them but mostly because she loves crayons.  I would (and will!) spend my money on real bath crayons.</li>
    <li> Hey Crayola - WHERE&#x27;S THE COLOR?  NON of my pens had any color in them, they were just filled with smelly clear soap.  I am reading descriptions of these pens and a little confused on why you are selling them as a coloring product if they don&#x27;t have any color. And P.s. tiny humans and their skin and private bits that get lathered up in the tub, well they are very sensitive to fragrances and chemicals. So all the smell that is coming from this soap, yeah...NOT a good thing for kids.  I would be willing to bet (money, not my baby&#x27;s health) that if my girl bathed in this product she would for sure be going to the doctor in 3 days with a UTI or yeast infection no matter how much we rinsed her off with soap free water.</li>
    <li> Great procut for bath time</li>
    <li> Very transparent colored gel. One tube lasts about one bath. Kids enjoyed them.</li>
    <li> Very fun and easy to use.</li>
    <li> These smell great, and they are so much fun in the bathtub, and my daughter loves them. My only issue was when they were delivered, a couple of them had exploded in each package. I ordered three packages. Once I rinsed them off, they were fine.</li>
    <li> product is good, but will last maybe 2 baths</li>
    <li> These gels provide the fun of fingerpainting without the mess. Good product!  I have enjoyed these for a long time.  My little girl loves to use them during bath time.</li>
