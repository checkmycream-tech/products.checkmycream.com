      <li>and I have tried so many items.</li>
      <li>This shampoo is simply The best!!</li>
      <li>I ordered the 2 in 1 because I read in reviews that it smells better than the Jason dandruff shampoo (which is strong).</li>
      <li>I would then need to use another shampoo to clean the smell!</li>
      <li>Really great product, no animal products, and no harmful chemical like the stuff you get in most places, it controls the drandruff better than any other product I have used, and I&#x27;ve used many for many years.</li>

      <li>So far so good.  </li>
      <li>This is a good, natural dandruff product.</li>
      <li>But the original one smells like sulfur after I use it.</li>

      <li>I love the product so far...real test will be in the winter when the air gets much drier.</li>
      <li>(mild psoriasis/dandruff).</li>
      <li>Effectively eliminated my dandruff problem while also not overly drying out my hair like many other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have done.</li>
      <li>The smell is not as pleasant as I expected</li>
      <li>Do not forget either that this is made by the highly respectable Jason company, and is ALL NATURAL.</li>
      <li>Could buy just as good at the market for less</li>
      <li>Like the shampoo very much.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather very much.</li>
      <li>She uses this with a plastic brush massage item to rub the shampoo into her scalp very gently.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the anti-dandruff performance especially considering that this is a natural product.</li>
      <li>That being said, do your research and experiment with the main ingredients first!</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t bought any other kind of shampoo, as this is the go to.</li>
      <li>It also already includes the conditioner so left my hair nice and soft afterwards.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, average shampoo, and it cleans my hair, conditions it, and treats the dandruf.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found this shampoo no more dandruff and cheers to living chemical free.</li>
      <li>and I like the smell, but it is strong - reminds me of Irish Spring bar soap).</li>
      <li>I used it once and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in dandruff immediately, but my problem did lessen over the next couple weeks.</li>
      <li>BUT it&#x27;s very drying.</li>
      <li>Arrived promptly, but I didn&#x27;t help my scalp much with about four or five uses.</li>
      <li>It helps with the smelly part of my scalp but it does absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>Ignore that it is no foams much.  </li>
      <li>I had bought this to Whole food to try for my son that has ezcema</li>
      <li>I think the other shampoo is better.</li>
      <li>This is the first one that completely works.  </li>
      <li>It does moisturize my hair nicely (2-in-1&#x27;s usually weigh down my hair) and it smells very nice, unlike a lot of other dandruff shampoos!</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>My daughter is a tween with Natural very curly hair</li>
      <li>actually made the psoriasis worth.  </li>
      <li>I wanted a shampoo that was more natural than the typical stuff on the grocery shelf.  </li>
      <li>Only used this because of the conditioner, the shampoo only version is fine</li>
      <li>such a wonderful product, the water here is extremely hard and has left my scalp dry and itchy, this shampoo helped in days</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much change in terms of dandruff reduction but at least it kept my hair clean.</li>
      <li>Hair looks pretty good, but it can be a tad drying with daily use -- I compensate for this by using a slightly shinier hair wax than my usual matte wax.</li>
      <li>My personal preference would be something a little more herbal or woodsier.</li>
      <li>But for whatever reason, this shampoo completely controls my seborrheic dermatitis, while others don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Not harsh at all, and makes me forget I ever had dandruff.</li>
      <li>The smell isn&#x27;t bad, kind of a slightly sweet, almost Head &amp; Shoulders fragrance.</li>
      <li>Not only does it work, it also keeps my hair moisturized and maintains normal oil production.</li>
      <li>This is not as powerful as the plain (no conditioner) version of this product.</li>
      <li>I had used the original, plain, shampoo at first to help with my mild dandruf, and although it worked very well, it left a sharp, slightly unpleasant, after-smell.</li>
      <li>Really, just two and a half months?</li>

    <li> Working okay so far, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any insane difference yet. It does moisturize my hair nicely (2-in-1&#x27;s usually weigh down my hair) and it smells very nice, unlike a lot of other dandruff shampoos!</li>
    <li> This is a good, natural dandruff product. However, I received the regular Jason dandruff shampoo. I did not receive the 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner that I ordered. Had I ordered the regular Jason dandruff shampoo, I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This got rid of some seasonal dandruff in just a few days.  I am very pleased with the anti-dandruff performance especially considering that this is a natural product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t Do anything whatsoever....</li>
    <li> I tried several different products.  This one works.</li>
    <li> excellent product &amp; service</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ok shampoo. I didn&#x27;t really notice much change in terms of dandruff reduction but at least it kept my hair clean. It also already includes the conditioner so left my hair nice and soft afterwards. The smell is not as pleasant as I expected but I have some other medicated shampoos that smell much worse so I guess this is not too bad.   One major negative for me is the expiration date, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so short. I purchased this shampoo on October 14, 2014 and the expiration date is January 2015. Really, just two and a half months? Somewhat disappointed. Make sure you check on the expiration date before buying this product. Typically a shampoo should last anywhere from 1-2 years opened and 3 unopened. Three months is just way too short.</li>
    <li> such a wonderful product, the water here is extremely hard and has left my scalp dry and itchy, this shampoo helped in days</li>
    <li> I have a dry scalp. It gets itchy sometimes. I also have this one patch that smells. No idea why but it just does. Every two days, it will smell. Only the Jason&#x27;s dandruff shampoos have countered the smell. But the original one smells like sulfur after I use it. While I don&#x27;t mind, sometimes I want a change. I was able to smell this in person and it smells so much better. BUT it&#x27;s very drying. It leaves an almost gummy powdery finish on your hair. It helps with the smelly part of my scalp but it does absolutely nothing for my hair. My hair is this dry mess because of this shampoo. Otherwise, it works for my scalp. It doesn&#x27;t lather very much. The consistency is like a jelly gel. I wish the formulation did more for the hair though. Nothing to write home about. I think the other shampoo is better.</li>
    <li> Just okay.  Could buy just as good at the market for less</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hooked. Haven&#x27;t bought any other kind of shampoo, as this is the go to. Not harsh at all, and makes me forget I ever had dandruff.</li>
    <li> actually made the psoriasis worth.  Arrived in plastic bag - and had leaked.  No smell which is good. Costly for what you get</li>
    <li> Smell is good, and I suffer from MCS and the smell didn&#x27;t bother me. But I have thick hair and the conditioner in this product is far from sufficient for my long thick hair, so I had to always use another conditioner with it, which totally defeats the purpose of having a &amp;#34;2 in 1&amp;#34; product, imo.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s my favorite dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly, but I didn&#x27;t help my scalp much with about four or five uses. I may need to give more time. It does smell okay though.</li>
    <li> Omg I don&#x27;t know where to begin with this shampoo. I&#x27;ve had dandruff all my life, I&#x27;m 32 now. No shampoo has helped, but I stuck to head and shoulders the last few years because it works a little but never was 100% because of all the chemicals, parabens, sls in it. In the last few years I&#x27;ve become organic in what I eat, stay away from processed and chemical and preservative laden foods and this year I progressed to natural cosmetics and beauty products. This shampoo is simply The best!! I relieve I has dandruff all these years due to the harsh shampoos I&#x27;ve used all my life since I was a child. I&#x27;m so glad I found this shampoo no more dandruff and cheers to living chemical free. Our skin is the largest organ in our body whatever u put on it will be absorb into ur body so always check the ingredients on everything!!!</li>
    <li> Nice stuff. Clean scent instead of medicine or fruit. Very good shampoo for anyone. Oh, and of course it gets rid of dandruff.</li>
    <li> This is not as powerful as the plain (no conditioner) version of this product. If you have stubborn dandruff go with the plain shampoo version.</li>
    <li> Only used this because of the conditioner, the shampoo only version is fine but if you never use a conditioner then your hair becomes hard. This is the only one with conditioner that doesnt give me a dandruff.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I wanted a shampoo that was more natural than the typical stuff on the grocery shelf.  After reading the other reviews I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  I love the product so far...real test will be in the winter when the air gets much drier.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I had used the original, plain, shampoo at first to help with my mild dandruf, and although it worked very well, it left a sharp, slightly unpleasant, after-smell. I would then need to use another shampoo to clean the smell! And then need to condition my hair, whenever that was necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now however, with this shampoo + conditioner, I have the perfect product! The smell is nice, average shampoo, and it cleans my hair, conditions it, and treats the dandruf. It is a pleasure and a convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Do not forget either that this is made by the highly respectable Jason company, and is ALL NATURAL. No harmful ingredients or chemicals.</li>
    <li> Really great product, no animal products, and no harmful chemical like the stuff you get in most places, it controls the drandruff better than any other product I have used, and I&#x27;ve used many for many years. I recommend this for anyone considering buying a good quality product.</li>
    <li> Effectively eliminated my dandruff problem while also not overly drying out my hair like many other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried have done.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo. Highly recommend. Tips. apply small amount  to first wash. Then apply a bit more to another wash. Ignore that it is no foams much.  It still does its job. I washed only every 4-5 days.</li>
    <li> This smells good and keeps my scalp from drying out.</li>
    <li> I had bought this to Whole food to try for my son that has ezcema it was great because he is developing dry scalp...so I bought 2 bottle for him but for some reason the more he use it there is a bad  odor that we can&#x27;t take it anymore!..sorry we have to throw away the bottle.</li>
    <li> This item works. My daughter is a tween with Natural very curly hair and I have tried so many items. She uses this with a plastic brush massage item to rub the shampoo into her scalp very gently. Then she leaves it on her hair/scalp  for 5-7 min. Rinses it out. After that she puts a leave in conditioning coconut oil curl cream just at the ends of her hair. That way her scalp can breathe. We do this once a week now. It works awesome!</li>
    <li> The active ingredient, pyrithione zinc, isn&#x27;t novel. It&#x27;s the same stuff used in Head &amp; Shoulders and a host of other anti-dandruff shampoos. But for whatever reason, this shampoo completely controls my seborrheic dermatitis, while others don&#x27;t. Red patches were healed and flakes dramatically reduced after about a week of daily use. After two weeks, I stopped flaking.    Hair looks pretty good, but it can be a tad drying with daily use -- I compensate for this by using a slightly shinier hair wax than my usual matte wax. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, kind of a slightly sweet, almost Head &amp; Shoulders fragrance. My personal preference would be something a little more herbal or woodsier. These are minor niggles considering what this product has done for my scalp.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many products for itching and dandruff.  This is the first one that completely works.  My hair continues to smell wonderful until my next shampoo.</li>
    <li> We mostly buy vegan/cruelty free products that are free of parabens and phthalates. The last hold-out was my husband&#x27;s Head and Shoulders Dandruff Control 2 in 1 Shampoo/Conditioner. I previously bought Jason&#x27;s Dandruff Control Shampoo (not the 2 in 1) and he wasn&#x27;t crazy about the smell (he still uses that sometimes and I like the smell, but it is strong - reminds me of Irish Spring bar soap). He also still wanted a 2 in 1. I found this product at a store and it was the last one on the shelf. He loves this as a replacement for Head and Shoulders because it&#x27;s a good shampoo/conditioner, it works to control dandruff, and the smell is light. He&#x27;s very happy with it and this is the second time I have ordered it from this seller online and both times we have had a good experience.</li>
    <li> A friend turned me on to this product. It works, feels and smells better than the competition. By far the best product I&#x27;ve discovered to-date...</li>
    <li> Great item for the price and delivery was excellent</li>
    <li> Like the shampoo very much.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 2 in 1 because I read in reviews that it smells better than the Jason dandruff shampoo (which is strong). The reviews were correct however I feel that the 2 in 1 doesn&#x27;t work as well (mild psoriasis/dandruff). I will continue to buy Jason dandruff shampoo.</li>
    <li> Best working shampoo for my seborrheic dermatitis. Ive been a victim of SB for 8 years and the only shampoos that worked were head and shoulders and a prescribed overpriced ciclopyrox shampoo but they were too harsh with the chemicals. After going &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; changing my diet and spending $150 on shampoos that didnt work i found this alternative to head and shoulders because it contains Zinc P. Not only does it work, it also keeps my hair moisturized and maintains normal oil production. Please keep in mind that everyone is different! Therefore not every product is for everyone. Before buying this one i tried the other anti-dandruff by Jasons that contained salyic acid and sulfur which didnt work for me but works for others. That being said, do your research and experiment with the main ingredients first!</li>
    <li> Even though this has conditioner in it, it left my hair feeling very dry (african american relaxed hair). I used it once and didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference in dandruff immediately, but my problem did lessen over the next couple weeks. I only used the product once, so I don&#x27;t know if I can equate it to the shampoo or weather, change in exercise or eating routine.</li>
    <li> seems to help with flaky psoriasis better than others</li>
