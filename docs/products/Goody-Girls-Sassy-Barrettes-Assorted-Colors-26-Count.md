      <li>They are fine for thin hair.</li>

    <li> I like these barrettes.  They are fine for thin hair. Probably wouldn&#x27;t hold very thick hair, but I am pleased. Bought for my two year old grand daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for plastic barrettes that clip closed because the alligator clips and bendy metal type I&#x27;m seeing everywhere don&#x27;t stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair. These do stay in her hair but the colors are flat and &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; - tomato red, dark red, pepto pink, a Limey green bordering on light avocado, turquoise, banana yellow, and white. Also, I thought the molds would be of ribbons and flowers, but many are quirky animal shapes - two sets of cats playing a banjo, and one set of jackrabbits. Maybe these are surplus from the fifties. My daughter doesn&#x27;t seem to care, but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these if I&#x27;d seen them in a store.</li>
    <li> Super cute.  Purchased as a gift and she loved them.  These are for fine hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only Barrette that stay in my daughters fine hair. These are impossible to find in stores locally, happy to get them on Amazon. Also, these are the same style and designs that I had in the late 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Finally a barrette that will stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair!  I like that there are so many colors, I can always find one to match her current outfit.  Such a simple product but relieved to have found something that will stay in her fine hair.</li>
    <li> These must be from the exact same molds as the ones I had in the 80&#x27;s!  These are really cute and I&#x27;m having fun mixing and matching.</li>
    <li> The only barrette for my 3 year old granddaughter &#x27; s fine hair.</li>
    <li> Love these - reminiscent of my childhood and they stay in place!</li>
    <li> My little girl loves these.</li>
    <li> Cute barrettes, have little teeth that really hold fine hair, and cute little characters on each barrette.  My granddaughter loved them.</li>
    <li> I used to wear these barrettes when I was young. Now I&#x27;m a 43 year old mother of boys, but purchased these to help keep my (male) doodle&#x27;s hair out of his eyes when we are working on training. These hold up well and do not slip out of his hair like dog barrettes do. He may look a little goofy, but I like them and they stay in!</li>
    <li> These are the plastic barrettes from your childhood. They are the only ones that will actually stay in my daughters thin hair. Love them!</li>
    <li> These are the classic barrettes from the 80s. They are the only barrettes that stay in my daughter&#x27;s fine hair. All the ones in the stores slide out within an hour, and these hold most of the day. I wish you could still find them in stores, but you can&#x27;t! Great nostalgic barrettes that are cute and functional.</li>
    <li> Very cheap. The broke off my daughters hair after a few hours. My daughter is mixed and she has a very full head. These didn&#x27;t do anything for her hair. I ended up using it to hold her ends down when it&#x27;s braided. But she didn&#x27;t like it bc they kept getting into her face and making her itch.</li>
    <li> Nostalgic. ..got these for my granddaughter!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my little girl years ago and they were made in America. Now it says China but they still seem to be good quality and still holds the fine hair of my grand babies.</li>
    <li> Just the barrettes I was looking for! Works well even for young toddler&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
    <li> Super cute, but my daughter is able to pull them out easily.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how long these are.  They may be OK for little girls, but not for babies.</li>
    <li> Love them, but the price is ridiculously outrageous!!</li>
    <li> Grand daughter loves &#x27;em.  Had to buy a second package cuz she took the first package home with her :D</li>
    <li> Perfect for my 9 month old daughter. These are the clips from the 80s. They are adorable and stay in her fine hair</li>
    <li> As described, great selection, awesome colors.</li>
