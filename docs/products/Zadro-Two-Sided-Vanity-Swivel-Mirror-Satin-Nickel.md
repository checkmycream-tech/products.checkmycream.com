      <li>Well I went out on a limb, and it was totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Good but much smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
      <li>This mirror sits very nicely on top of my vanity and is made of very durable metal.</li>
      <li>Is cute, a decent size, and works where I can put it.  </li>
      <li>this is a nice mirror, i don&#x27;t know why i was surprised that it was smaller than i imagined but its still nice.</li>
      <li>looks like a fun house mirror.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth every penny.</li>
      <li>The other side is 5x magnification, which I don&#x27;t find myself using too often, but the regular side mirror is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a pretty mirror that swivels so even if you aren&#x27;t right at eye level</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it needs to, no fuss.</li>
      <li>So I started shopping on Amazon (because I do pretty much 100% of my shopping on here) and found this one.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say I like the magnified size since I don&#x27;t like to see my pores that closely, but the  magnification certainly does the job.  </li>
      <li>VERY high quality.</li>
      <li>Nice and sturdy, well made with a little weight to it.</li>

      <li>This has no distortion  and is much prettier than I expected.</li>
      <li>The actual mirror is big enough for your entire face, but doesn&#x27;t take up too much room.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Works great and looks good too</li>
    <li> Excellent shaving mirror and very well made.</li>
    <li> Great mirror. Feels heavy and well constructed. Quality details all around and exudes simplistic elegance. The 5X magnification only works when subject is close to mirror or image looks like a fun house mirror.</li>
    <li> Good but much smaller than I thought it would be.</li>
    <li> OK for the price. Bought for vacation rental.</li>
    <li> Tad bit small, but still in love. (:</li>
    <li> Loving it!!!! Nice and sturdy, well made with a little weight to it. Nice magnification, it&#x27;s a cute mirror for your vanity. Or wherever you put it. Those pesky hairs will not escape!</li>
    <li> this is a nice mirror, i don&#x27;t know why i was surprised that it was smaller than i imagined but its still nice. its not heavy either. i thought it would feel more heavy and metal</li>
    <li> Really nice and sturdy mirror, it won&#x27;t just swivel out of place. I like that it is felted on the bottom so it doesn&#x27;t damage the surface on which you place it (in my case, mirror vanity table). Can easily be held in one hand if you need to. Glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> I recently remodeled my master bath with all brushed nickel fixtures and wanted a small vanity mirror to match.  This one is beautiful and the perfect size.  Excellent quality.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It has a clean looking design, simple with a regular and magnified mirror. Sturdy. Also, a good price. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> So, I have never had the need for a vanity mirror before. I don&#x27;t really wear make up and I&#x27;ve always just made due with the mirrors in whatever bathroom I used. In reality, I had no idea they made vanity mirrors! I happened to see one when I was shopping one day and knew I needed one! I was ok with &amp;#34;making due&amp;#34; but in reality, it was a huge pain to lean over the counter to fix my eye brows or put on my foundation. So I started shopping on Amazon (because I do pretty much 100% of my shopping on here) and found this one. When I saw how much it was, I kinda freaked because it seemed kind of overpriced (again I had never used a vanity mirror before). Well I went out on a limb, and it was totally worth it! VERY high quality. Absolutely worth every penny. I LOVE this mirror!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it needs to, no fuss.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror I like the size it&#x27;s not to small just the right size great price overall I&#x27;m pleased with this vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> This came fully packaged as though purchased from a store, and inside, the lining around the mirror was badly scratched and peeling on both sides. Neither the box, nor the packaging showed any signs of having been tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and would NOT buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a good sturdy mirror and I like it.  I would have preferred a 3x magnification, however that was not available.</li>
    <li> Perfect size; I wasn&#x27;t really sure, since I have limited space.  Can&#x27;t say I like the magnified size since I don&#x27;t like to see my pores that closely, but the  magnification certainly does the job.  Is cute, a decent size, and works where I can put it.  A nice price for a decent mirror.</li>
    <li> Nice size but the magnification side is distorted! I was really surprised with the distortion because the mirror is not huge.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I have a small apartment and I don&#x27;t have room for a vanity table, this works just fine. I can Sit this anywhere and do my makeup.</li>
    <li> This mirror sits very nicely on top of my vanity and is made of very durable metal. The actual mirror is big enough for your entire face, but doesn&#x27;t take up too much room. The other side is 5x magnification, which I don&#x27;t find myself using too often, but the regular side mirror is wonderful. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Very nice finish and sleek design.  Small enough to put on the dresser, but large enough to see.  The 5X magnification is perfect for tweezing eyebrows.  Good value.</li>
    <li> It is pretty and simple. Arrived quickly and in good condition. I think it looks nicer that in the pictures.</li>
    <li> This mirror is Tiny.  T I N Y. Don&#x27;t bother purchasing this mirror. It is perfect if you are living in a dollhouse.</li>
    <li> Look&#x27;s good &amp; it works good, What more can I say.</li>
    <li> Smaller then expected.</li>
    <li> This mirror looks so nice on my bathroom counter.  The nickel finish matches my faucet.  It&#x27;s the perfect height for applying my makeup.  Glad I ordered this.</li>
    <li> Nice and heavy-duty, doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> Excellent mirror, strong and is just right size. works well in the bathroom or on the vanity.  a must have for the lady on the go.</li>
    <li> Wife broke hers so this is a replacement.  I am sure it will work as designed. Otherwise, I will be looking for another one.</li>
    <li> I like the size, but the image is not that clear, especially the magnified side. I thought it would help for putting on makeup but it is useless.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my three teenage sons but when my husband saw it, he decided it was his.  I&#x27;m now ordering a second one.  Great for the closeup facial work that some of us may need to do from makeup to zits. It has a smooth bottom with fabric on it, so it won&#x27;t scratch your countertops. Though very sturdy, it is lightweight. It also looks nice and much more pricey than what I paid.  Great bargain for a great product!</li>
    <li> I had looked at several mirrors like this at local stores, but I&#x27;m glad I got this one.  It is much more sturdy than those were.  The mirrors are as advertised and swivel and hold where I want, so I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I thought and was wobbly.  For this price I could&#x27;ve gotten something from the store instead.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a vanity mirror that didn&#x27;t have 15x magnification, as I hate how distorted those can be.  This has no distortion  and is much prettier than I expected. It matches my brushed nickel in my bathroom perfectly.  I use it every day for makeup and plucking eyebrows.</li>
    <li> Not bad, actual mirror is a little small but it&#x27;s what I expected from the dimensions. Mirror is great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Looks great, sturdy design!</li>
    <li> I got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. The base is sturdy and the construction is good. The normal and 5x mirrors are excellent as well.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for the price..,just know it is NOT a lighted mirror.</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s the perfect height to set on the table. The mirror is very clear. A very good buy.</li>
    <li> Nice quality frame and stand. I really like the brushed metal look.</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described. Good mirror, perfect for what I needed, and not that expensive.</li>
    <li> I just bought 10 of these mirrors to go in the rooms at the boutique hotel I work in. They are great! We downsized from a much larger vanity mirror due to cost. This vanity mirror is made well and priced right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror for the price. I didnt want to have to get make up glasses and this is fine for being able to see without my glasses on to apply makeup or whatever</li>
    <li> Being a college student I wasn&#x27;t looking for a mirror that was too fancy I just needed on that looked nice,had two sides(one regular &amp; the other one with magnification) &amp; wasn&#x27;t at an outrageous price. This fit the bill.It&#x27;s a pretty mirror that swivels so even if you aren&#x27;t right at eye level you don&#x27;t have to prop it onto books to be able to use it you can just adjust the mirror which I love.</li>
