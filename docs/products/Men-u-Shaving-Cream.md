      <li>I have tried them all, this product so far works the best.  </li>
      <li>Nice refreshing scent, too.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s concentrated for true value!!</li>
      <li>Only the best for shaving!</li>
      <li>I love the locking pump bottle; you can&#x27;t get more convenient than a travel-friendly bottle with a locking top that won&#x27;t rupture and squirt its contents all over the inside of your dopp bag.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Simply the greatest shaving cream I&#x27;ve EVER used...</li>
      <li>I tried bowl lathering first but did not get very good results (I may have added too much water).</li>
      <li>use a Norelco Wet/Dry shaver (the latest) with shaving cream for a close, smooth shave.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use this with a brush anymore because I found myself using more of the product and could get a smooth shave without the brush with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>is knick free using this product for many years.</li>
      <li>This has a great, simple, scent I now associate with my husband!&lt;br /&gt;He</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t experience razor pull and the blade glides smoothly.</li>
      <li>I have used many different shaving gels &amp; creams and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>It also goes through airport security which is important to me.</li>
      <li>love it - used for many years - clean cut clean skin and people says feels so soft :-)</li>
      <li>This cream has a light, minty and clean scent</li>
      <li>Only fair compared to others.  </li>
      <li>It spreads and lathers quickly.  </li>
      <li>I have nicked myself rarely and that is saying a lot because I refuse to spend $5 per blade and go with &amp;#34;lesser&amp;#34; quality razor blades.  </li>
      <li>The cream has a fresh fragrance.    </li>
      <li>No crazy smells either.</li>
      <li>3.3oz is a small bottle but more effective than a 12oz bottle of something else.  </li>
      <li>165 shaves out of a little bottle, simply amazing!  </li>
      <li>True, it is very slippery.........</li>
      <li>The next time I used this I face lathered with the brush instead and got a very smooth shave with no razor burn.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Compared to the other two creams I have tried, this causes more missed spots, where spotty light stubble can be detected.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not a heavy cream and does is not meant to have a huge amount of lather on your face.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But when I&#x27;m out, I am definitely buying more.</li>
      <li>on the first pass.  </li>
      <li>I use one pump on my badger brush and it is more than enough for three passes on my face.</li>
      <li>It can&#x27;t hold moisture, so it drys out after the first pass and then the razor sticks and drags.  </li>
      <li>Although this shave cream is pricey it lasts a long time and gives a very comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>use 2 full pumps for each pass for each of two passes, so I&#x27;m actually using 4 pumps&#x27; worth every day.</li>
      <li>Clogged up the razor too fast.</li>
      <li>I really like this shaving cream.  </li>
      <li>really.</li>
      <li>Very nice shave cream, and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Did not provide as smooth a shave as expected.  </li>
      <li>My new go to shave cream.  </li>
      <li>Will buy more if I can ever use this little bottle up!</li>
      <li>The lather made by this cream is not as thick as other shaving creams such as TOBS, Truefitt and Hill or Trumpers but the lubricants more than make up for the thinner, more watery lather.</li>
      <li>This has solved the laceration problem, and the blades, of course, last much longer.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about the 165 shaves that is advertised, but it will go far, it seems to</li>
      <li>It is very concentrated, therefore only on pump required.  </li>
      <li>To me it is worth the initial extra cost.</li>
      <li>Now if only Men-u would make an economical larger bottle...</li>
      <li>A ton of product in a small package, easy glide, no knicks.  </li>
      <li>men-u has the added plus in that its container takes up far less &amp;#34;real estate&amp;#34; on the shower ledge than the tube of Prorasso - important when considering the other soap products that clutter my shower ledge.&lt;br /&gt;  One squirt is all that is needed - about the size of a dime.  </li>
      <li>Definitely makes my face slick and the razor glides as smooth as ice.</li>
      <li>Not sure if the lathering is due to the &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; component of the cream or if the cream contains sodium laureth sulfate, an additive to many formulations to produce lathering.</li>
      <li>Eventually I developed a routine of doing a \\&quot;preshave\\&quot; with an electric shaver (various brands), following up with a blade shave.</li>
      <li>You can usually get an adequate amount from one pump, so these do last a while.</li>

    <li> 3.3oz is a small bottle but more effective than a 12oz bottle of something else.  Great for traveling and very effective on your face.  I did compare with other shaving creams and it won the battle.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for 40+ years.  This is the best shave cream I have ever used.  Put a tiny amount in your palm, add some water. and spread all over your beard.  I have nicked myself rarely and that is saying a lot because I refuse to spend $5 per blade and go with &amp;#34;lesser&amp;#34; quality razor blades.  You have got to try this stuff....really.</li>
    <li> This is very comfortable to shave with and suds up very nicely.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried a variety of shaving techniques--blade and electric--to achieve a close shave without lacerating myself. Eventually I developed a routine of doing a \\&quot;preshave\\&quot; with an electric shaver (various brands), following up with a blade shave. For about the last year and a half I&#x27;ve been using Men-u Shave cream, applying one pumpful on my dry beard, wetting the foil of a Panasonic wet/dry shaver, and then shaving. This cuts the electric shave time in about half.    I follow that with another pumpful of shave cream and do a blade shave. This has solved the laceration problem, and the blades, of course, last much longer. The cream has a fresh fragrance.    The other thing I like about the Men-u product is that is TSA compliant, and the locking mechanism stops the pump from activating while in transit.</li>
    <li> An exceptional shaving cream in which provides for an excellent, close shave, leaving the face refreshed. I rank this shaving cream with the top shaving creams from England. Two pumps of cream are required when applying cream by hand, only one drop when using a shaving brush. Either way, good spreading of the cream, with lathering also. Not sure if the lathering is due to the &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; component of the cream or if the cream contains sodium laureth sulfate, an additive to many formulations to produce lathering.</li>
    <li> Excellent for travel since the cap easily locks.  You can usually get an adequate amount from one pump, so these do last a while.</li>
    <li> I have even using this for 4 years.  If they is not enough of a review, then I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
    <li> Holy moly is this stuff SLICK! That&#x27;s obviously the silicone at work there. With Men-u shaving cream, I get a glass-smooth shave every single day. Nice refreshing scent, too. I love the locking pump bottle; you can&#x27;t get more convenient than a travel-friendly bottle with a locking top that won&#x27;t rupture and squirt its contents all over the inside of your dopp bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 2 full pumps for each pass for each of two passes, so I&#x27;m actually using 4 pumps&#x27; worth every day. At that rate I don&#x27;t think this bottle is going to last me long, maybe a month and a half, give or take. But when I&#x27;m out, I am definitely buying more. Now if only Men-u would make an economical larger bottle...</li>
    <li> I have never used any shave cream or soap that can compare to this.  I&#x27;m a lifelong Men-U customer now.</li>
    <li> This has a great, simple, scent I now associate with my husband!&lt;br /&gt;He is knick free using this product for many years.</li>
    <li> Everything about this is 5 stars. the container is perfect for home or travel, although when I travel I now use the travel set. You can use this with or without brush. I don&#x27;t use this with a brush anymore because I found myself using more of the product and could get a smooth shave without the brush with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a heavy cream and does is not meant to have a huge amount of lather on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because you can shave with little to no mess and it leaves you with a good shaving foundation.</li>
    <li> It is like regular soap.</li>
    <li> Did not provide as smooth a shave as expected.  Only fair compared to others.  Clogged up the razor too fast.</li>
    <li> Wonderful lather, nice odor.  It lends it&#x27;s self to a very nice shave.</li>
    <li> This product shaves as well as Prorasso, another excellent shaving product.  men-u has the added plus in that its container takes up far less &amp;#34;real estate&amp;#34; on the shower ledge than the tube of Prorasso - important when considering the other soap products that clutter my shower ledge.&lt;br /&gt;  One squirt is all that is needed - about the size of a dime.

    <li> After reading the reviews, I was looking for a great shaving experience.  Boy, was I disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Norelco Wet/Dry shaver (the latest) with shaving cream for a close, smooth shave.  Of the last three I tried (Gillette Fusion Gel &amp; Barbasol)  this was the worst.  True, it is very slippery.........on the first pass.  It can&#x27;t hold moisture, so it drys out after the first pass and then the razor sticks and drags.  I have to keep wiping water on my face to revitalize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other two creams I have tried, this causes more missed spots, where spotty light stubble can be detected.  I don&#x27;t find this with the other creams.  They provide a uniformly close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed, too, because of its small size and ability to get through TSA.  I was hoping this product was the answer to the TSA problem and give a good shave.  It&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> Men-u shaving cream is great. I have used many different shaving gels &amp; creams and this is by far the best. I have also used Men-u facial moisturizer lift and I think this is excellent also.</li>
    <li> love it - used for many years - clean cut clean skin and people says feels so soft :-)</li>
    <li> Only the best for shaving!</li>
    <li> Great shave cream.  Good smooth shave with no razor burn.  Will buy more if I can ever use this little bottle up!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream comes in a small bottle but a little goes a long way. I use one pump on my badger brush and it is more than enough for three passes on my face. The lather made by this cream is not as thick as other shaving creams such as TOBS, Truefitt and Hill or Trumpers but the lubricants more than make up for the thinner, more watery lather. I tried bowl lathering first but did not get very good results (I may have added too much water). The next time I used this I face lathered with the brush instead and got a very smooth shave with no razor burn. This cream has a light, minty and clean scent and I can feel the cooling of the mint when I brush it on my face. This isn&#x27;t going to replace Truefitt and Hill as my go to cream but it definitely has a spot in my rotation, especially when I am in a rush or travelling.</li>
    <li> Simply the greatest shaving cream I&#x27;ve EVER used...it allows for an extremely close shave and total comfort during and afterwards...and it&#x27;s concentrated for true value!!</li>
    <li> I did not think that this expensive product had anything to offer over any cheap shaving foam.</li>
