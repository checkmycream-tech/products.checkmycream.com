<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Thank you so much for the fast shipment, smells great</li>
    <li> I have used Gucci Rush for many years, but could not find it in stores. I was glad to find it online, and at prices that are even better than in the stores. When I first started using &#x27;designer perfumes&#x27;, one store owner introduced me to Gucci Rush (and Hugo Pure Purple) and I instantly fell in love. I&#x27;m totally lost without these two perfumes, and it has been very difficult for anyone to convince me to try out any other perfume (i.e. to give up the two and start using another one - oh no!!). The only way I can add another perfume to my &#x27;arsenal&#x27; is to try out something else as long as I still have my two favorite ones to fall back on :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consider Gucci Rush to be a strong perfume. If you don&#x27;t like strong perfumes, it would be best if you avoided this one as you might hate it :-)</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my friend who loves this perfume. Shipment was fast and came sealed perfectly with no problems at all.</li>
    <li> I was thrilled to find that Amazon was selling Guccui Rush as I had read it had been discontinued. However, I&#x27;m not sure I received the genuine product. It didn&#x27;t smell like the bottle purchased at Saks,nor did it last as long. If I hadn&#x27;t tosssed the recipt, I would have returned it. It had either faded with age or was a fake version. Very disappointing and I won&#x27;t order perfume from Amazon again. Caveat Emptor!</li>
    <li> I love this scent at first it goes on storng but settles lovely and smells great on my skin!! This is great to use in any season!! One of my favorites!!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, i recommend this</li>
    <li> One of my favorites. Not heavy flowery smell! More of a musky smelling perfume. I always get compliments on this hours after I have sprayed it on.</li>
    <li> My favorite forever...</li>
    <li> Came as mentioned, it&#x27;s a gift and I&#x27;m sure they will love it.</li>
    <li> I found this perfume through a sample in a catalog years ago.  It has been my favorite ever since.  I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like Gucci rush, nor does it stay on very long. Do not purchase from here go to overstock and get it</li>
    <li> Mom loved it. Made her very happy.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I am allergic to alot of the perfumes with a heavy scent, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have worn it for several years and get lots of compliments on the scent.</li>
    <li> The product seamed to be non original. The outside box had scratches as if oppened. The fragance itself wasn&#x27;t as the original, didn´t smell anything like the original.  The container also had scratches.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell at first,but then liked it. Also thought that it&#x27;s a little light (maybe half-empty), so checked the box when light was going through it. It was full.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m also over 45 (an interesting demographic), but I found this perfume in an unexpected way. I was reading the excellent [[ASIN:0375759816 The Emperor of Scent: A True Story of Perfume and Obsession]] and the scientist and scent genius in the book, Luca Turin, gave such a compelling, inexplicable description of this perfume (pp. 41-42):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Rush (Gucci)[five stars]...just a bit I loved...happened two or three hours into the story and felt like a warm breath whispering crazy things in my ear. That breath is back now strong, loud, irresistible, a sultry wind fit to keep everyone awake and plotting indiscretions...The thing smells like a person. To be exact, thanks to the milky lactone note, it smells like an infant&#x27;s breath mixed with his mother&#x27;s hairspray.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to find a sample first (try eBay), but I was sold immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love Gucci Rush, and I get more compliments when I wear than any other scent or perfume -- consistently from men and even my own husband and teen son comment every time I wear it. It&#x27;s almost like they can&#x27;t get enough either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I warn that it quite sweet-smelling and potent, so I&#x27;m careful not to overdo spraying it on. But don&#x27;t let the packaging or name prevent you from trying this luscious scent.</li>
    <li> I waste money on this when I was 16 and it smelled too mature for me.I got compliment from mostly older women so ended up giving it away to my friends mom.</li>
    <li> THIS SELLER SHOWED IMPECCABLE PROFFESSIONALISM AND THE PURCHASE WAS SENT IN THE TIME THAT WAS STATED</li>
    <li> If you like jasmine or gardenias you will probably love this as much as I do.  This may be my new favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> When I received the product, the liquid was spilled all over the box, and there was like half of the perfume left. I contacted the seller and they sent me another one that arrived in the same conditions.</li>
    <li> I would suggest that if you love this fragrance, like I do, buy a few because I don&#x27;t trust cosmetics companies to keep what I like. Spray light on hot days. Go hog in the winter. You may not keep the man with this fragrance, but you&#x27;ll at least catch him.</li>
    <li> ok 20 characters required and this is a pain in the rear.  I put down a brief summary and had it declined because not 20 characters.  I will no longer provide feedback. fadkjasdlkfjasdlkfjasdlk;fjasdlkfjsdl;</li>
    <li> I chose this because a friend wears it and I love it on her, and it has met all my expectations.</li>
    <li> love this perfume glad I found it at amazon at a reasonable price</li>
    <li> Loved it! fast shipping ;)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, smells amazing on her.  I dont see the point buying perfume that is so light you cant smell it yourself.  Not only can I, but she can as well. It smells rich and erotic, like the name sounds - Gucci Rush!</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this fragrance since it came out. This is my fall/winter fragrance. I get so many compliments (even from strangers!) when I wear this. People are always asking me what it is and of course, I tell them. I hope they never stop making this fabulous fragrance.</li>
    <li> Please believe the other negative reviews, it is true that the quality has dropped immensely. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a fake, it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same. And it definitely doesn&#x27;t stay on for long. You can barely tell if you&#x27;re wearing it within an hour. That being said I still love it, it is the closest thing you can buy now to what it used to be a few years ago. Gave it four stars still because it is my favorite inspite of the short duration of effect.</li>
    <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I just love my purchase, i always end up as a happy customer, of course i mostly but from sellers fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite, it&#x27;s like the smell have never left me. Love, Love, Love It!</li>
    <li> Definitely not the real deal the red container was so cheap and it&#x27;s hard to spray. The sent wares off in under 30min. Thought i was getting a deal but you get what u pay for. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a &amp;#34;sensual scent&amp;#34;, this is it! But the sillage is really disappointing. I can barely smell it on me after an hour.</li>
    <li> Was leaking everywhere when I got it. Completely soaked the box. But smells amazing.</li>
    <li> came on time, mom loved it</li>
    <li> Great I want to buy more but please put sold stock.</li>
    <li> The reason I did not give Gucci&#x27;s Rush a five star review was due to the packaging.  The red box is about 6 inches long and 3 inches high and this makes it awkward to hold and spray if you have small hands.  Maybe the red box is less awkward in a smaller size.    The perfume itself is wonderful--very sweet, floral, and soft.  There is a licorice/anise note that at first I did not care for but now really enjoy.  Reminds me of Lolita Limpicka but with a lot less licorice and more floral.</li>
    <li> When I got the product and opened, it looked like it was leaking, but I tought it will not be to much, but when my fiance opened complety, the perfume container was almost emty, I know that since it was shipped from the company, they knew that the perfume was leaking and still they shipped it any way, now I can not find the company to complaint about this problem, I will never buy from this company and you Amazon should be more careful about this, if any can be done, I will like to get a reimbursment or the same prefume but complete. Amazon is requesting from me to rate this item, but I will prefer to rate the company, I will not give them not even a single star, they are shipping defective product, and they know that.  Arturo Lomeli</li>
    <li> I have used this scent for years and it has become pretty much unavailable except at ridiculously high cost. It will always be a favorite.</li>
    <li> Product Was brand new and exactly as detailed. Was shipped around the holidays so it took a while but other than that quality priduct</li>
    <li> It is very nice  and not overwhelming at all.</li>
    <li> My wife really wanted this. None of the stores carry it now. This got to us quick and was exactly what she wanted.</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother-in-law and she loved it.  She wears it everyday and the perfume lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> It was shipped on time and ewxactly what I was looking for, This is the best smelling purfume! I did prime shipping and had a great experiance. I got a great price for this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been missing it was discontinued but glad to locate this fragrance. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I actually haven&#x27;t opened it up yet as it is a gift for someone in October. I was very pleased with how fast the product came to the house and how well it was protected for transport....cheers!!!!</li>
    <li> Love it, one of my fave scents. People always ask what is that I&#x27;m wearing. Would highly recommend. Love, love love!!!</li>
    <li> one of my favorite perfumes!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. It smells so nice!</li>
    <li> awesome fragance.. my favorite... i hope to buy it again</li>
    <li> Ever since I first caught a whiff of this perfume years ago, it has been my absolute favorite fragrance! It&#x27;s so feminine, long-lasting, and is wearable for day or night! Next purchase will be in bulk!</li>
    <li> I love Gucci&#x27;s Rush. I&#x27;m not sure if this is old/stale but the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long. Also the bottle is defective. It makes this weird clunking sound when press the button for the perfume. I&#x27;ve had this perfume before (purchased from a department store) and it is not normally like that. Also, part of the writing on the side of the bottle was worn off- this is not a big deal as I&#x27;m the only one who sees it, but that along with the other issues definitely tips me off that it was either old/knock off/store return etc... not a new bottle from Gucci.</li>
    <li> I love Gucci Rush and was disappointed when some of the stores I normally buy it from stopped selling it.  I was so glad to be able to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s among my top 3 favorites.  The smell is sexy and lasts all day.  One thing I have to say though is this perfume is more a fall/winter smell because it&#x27;s not very light. Nonetheless I still love it!!!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order this is the best stuff ever made for my wife fast shipping packing was great to</li>
    <li> I love the scent, but this was an expensive bottle and it it very light as if its not a full bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m wearing Gucci rush for almost 10 years and it fits me perfectly... Love it! I&#x27;m just upset it runs out of production, so when I get I chance I buy it... Please make some more</li>
    <li> wonderful fragrance,my favorite by far</li>
    <li> My wife live the Gucci. Thanks</li>
    <li> Cant get enough of this perfume! and drives my hubby crazy! Can get overbearing if you wear too much. The scent will last for hours upon hours.&lt;br /&gt;my hubby smells it on me in the evening after a long day at work.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite perfume and I always buy this for wifey every time she runs out. Thank you for the prompt response got it before the weekend which is great.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with Gucci Rush I love the smell and the price too</li>
    <li> Excellent!!! I really love it. This is the best website and there is no other place where you can find all what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Favorite fragrance by far. Can no longer find in stores so this was a great purchase. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my mom and it was embarrassing because it did not smell like Gucci it smelled like a fake :(</li>
    <li> excellent all very well, arrived in perfect condition 100% recommended, all very good, especially for women very good and special</li>
    <li> Smell is too old for my age</li>
    <li> Have used Gucci Rush for years, but since it&#x27;s an older scent it&#x27;s not easily available. I was pleased to be able to find it on Amazon. When I received my large 2.5oz bottle I was reminded why I love this scent so much. What I was disappointed about was the fact that while the box was sealed, the bottle was half empty. In fact the \\&quot;old\\&quot; bottle that I&#x27;ve had forever seemed to have more in it than the \\&quot;new\\&quot; one. Because of Amazon&#x27;s policy, they would not exchange. They did however, offer me a small discount so that I may buy another bottle. I love Amazon and will continue to shop there, but I may think twice about buying perfume. But LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Gucci Rush!! :)</li>
    <li> The strength and smell of the Gucci Rush is not the same as those that i have purchased previously over the years from perfume shops or department stores. I therefore wonder if the product purchased was not the genuine article!!</li>
    <li> i use to wear gucci ruch back in 2003 and i loverd it and getting now it was just awesome i love it :)</li>
    <li> This is not floral, but spicy with a HINT of cherry sweet. Everyone loves this!</li>
