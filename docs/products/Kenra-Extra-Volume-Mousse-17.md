      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products that claim to offer volume but this is truly my favorite.</li>
      <li>Love this product for thickening hair</li>
      <li>I was able to fix it with a q tip&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>I am using all of Kenra Products for the same reason of producing excellent results in hair management.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love Kenra products but</li>
      <li>My favorite mousse because it is not sticky, not greasy, pleasant scent, and holds my natural waves well after shampooing.  </li>
      <li>I have to admit I go into full panic attack mode!</li>
      <li>Makes hair easy to style and holds.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, not oily or greasy, and does not make your hair or hands sticky.</li>
      <li>I found it at a high end shop, tried it, and loved it.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair.  </li>
      <li>(Why pay for something that&#x27;s free like water?)</li>
      <li>I was SO happy to find it and will shop here in the future.</li>
      <li>Fantastic product, voted number one by hairdressers throughout Texas.</li>
      <li>My hair gets real frizzy in the humid weather, and after MANY years and MANY products, I couldn&#x27;t come up with something that would work without spraying 1/2 can of &amp;#34;instant freeze&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>This was my first time using this product, and I love it.</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m still on my original can), and I shampoo my hair 3x&#x27;s/week.</li>
      <li>The cap or trigger was damaged some in shipping, is now foaming better than at first.</li>
      <li>I received my order right away!  </li>
      <li>Makes my hair shiny and full of body.  </li>
      <li>Really great styling mousse, I have been using it for years and have tried other products</li>
      <li>It did give my fine hair some body, but not as much as I was expecting.  </li>
      <li>provides great volume with little quantity needed to produce the result.</li>
      <li>Worth buying.</li>
      <li>This product gives my hair more volume and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite product for my hair.. perfect weight for my limp blonde hair.</li>
      <li>It has a good hold, without weighing your hair down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found to help me get volume with my thin, straight hair.  </li>
      <li>If my hair dries before I&#x27;m done styling, I wet the circular brush lightly and redo the do!!</li>
      <li>I found this mousse to be pretty drying to my hair, although my hair is quite damaged.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s really all that I needed to say on this review---thanks!</li>
      <li>Really like Kenra products.</li>
      <li>I also don&#x27;t require much hold</li>
      <li>so this is a bit much for me, but my husband likes it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>and it made my hair very sticky</li>
      <li>GREAT mousse for espec.  for thin hair.  </li>
      <li>Very sticky made my hair look nappy&lt;</li>
      <li>It is denser and adds real body to your hair.</li>
      <li>give them the highest stars, and that&#x27;s a real test, &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t score high unless I would stake my name on it!</li>
      <li>I now no longer buy many other hair products as Kenra mousse does it all...................</li>
      <li>Love this stuff..can let my hair dry naturally without humility making it frizzy.</li>
      <li>would highly recommend Kenra Mousse No.17 to all women.</li>
      <li>My hair stylist highly recommends this product for my hair  </li>
      <li>The first time I used it, I used the same amount I was used to using with my Nexxus Mouse Plus Volumizing Foam, and it was too much and made my hair feel gummy.  </li>
      <li>I live in humid Texas.  </li>
      <li>I have been using Kenra Volume Mousse Extra Firm Hold Fixative Hair Styling Mousse for many years and it works very well  </li>
      <li>Great product was just little slow in delivery</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair bouncy and soft</li>
      <li>The mousse from the bottle I got from her came out of the bottle a light and fluffy foam.  </li>
      <li>I mean NOTHING is greater than their shampoo,conditioner, and mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the volume I get with this mousse, but be careful not to use too much.  </li>
      <li>Fast service, as expected</li>
      <li>Although expensive,  I like the product, as holds my set and style nicely.  </li>

    <li> Makes a dramatic difference in the weight and style of my otherwise thin hair!</li>
    <li> Good product and cheaper than I can get in the salon.  That&#x27;s really all that I needed to say on this review---thanks!</li>
    <li> I now no longer buy many other hair products as Kenra mousse does it all...................</li>
    <li> When I stopped going to my former hair dresser, I decided to look for Kenra Mousse on Amazon. I was SO happy to find it and will shop here in the future. Julie</li>
    <li> Used for years and love it</li>
    <li> The product is ok, I thought it would work better in humidity&lt;br /&gt;it does not hold up in this weather</li>
    <li> I like the volume I get with this mousse, but be careful not to use too much.  The first time I used it, I used the same amount I was used to using with my Nexxus Mouse Plus Volumizing Foam, and it was too much and made my hair feel gummy.  But now I use less (about the size of a ping-pong ball or less) and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> this is a must have product when it comes to hair styling!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend Kenra Mousse No.17 to all women.</li>
    <li> It did give my fine hair some body, but not as much as I was expecting.  My hair is oily and I felt this mousse made it look dull and dried out.</li>
    <li> The only Mousse I use! Love their products!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. It styles my hair without extra weight or stickiness. It leaves my hair bouncy and soft so no one even knows that I have used it.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product, voted number one by hairdressers throughout Texas. I haven&#x27;t used anything else in 2 years and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Kenra Mousse is the best material out there.&lt;br /&gt;Kathy</li>
    <li> I found this mousse to be pretty drying to my hair, although my hair is quite damaged. I also don&#x27;t require much hold so this is a bit much for me, but my husband likes it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff..can let my hair dry naturally without humility making it frizzy. Holds up for days!  Love Kenra products!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple years now.  When the store closed where I had been buying it I tried two other products and was so disappointed.  I was really happy with the site and their service and so glad to have this wonderful Mousse again.</li>
    <li> Kenra products for fine hair are just the best.  Makes hair easy to style and holds.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser got me on this in thexsalon.  Now I use it everytime I wash my hair.</li>
    <li> I live in humid Texas.  This is great for this weather!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten this mousse from my hairdresser before buying it online to find a better deal.  The mousse from the bottle I got from her came out of the bottle a light and fluffy foam.  The mousse comes out of this bottle almost liquid instead of foamy.  So, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s old, was stored improperly, was shaken up too much by shipping or handling, or if there is another reason for the change, but I think I&#x27;ll go back to my hairdresser next time.</li>
    <li> Love this product for thickening hair</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for my daughter who says, &amp;#34;Love it.&amp;#34; As a server in an upscale restaurant, which has an outdoor patio, in Florida&#x27;s humidity, she reports this product controls the frizzies caused by the state&#x27;s unrelenting humidity.</li>
    <li> Good price. I recommend this product. I like it . excellent product. i love it.my hair have good looking.it is good for my hair</li>
    <li> This was my first time using this product, and I love it. It has a good hold, without weighing your hair down. Will definitely buy again. Shipping was fast....and free!</li>
    <li> Although expensive,  I like the product, as holds my set and style nicely.  Been using this product for three years now...</li>
    <li> I use to use Sebastian laminates. Awesome for hair. I&#x27;ve been struggling to get something close to that produce. What recommendations do you give close to that product. Please help. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to my daughter by her stylist.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found to help me get volume with my thin, straight hair.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Kenra Volume Mousse Extra&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is AMAZING. I found it at a high end shop, tried it, and loved it. My hair gets real frizzy in the humid weather, and after MANY years and MANY products, I couldn&#x27;t come up with something that would work without spraying 1/2 can of &amp;#34;instant freeze&amp;#34; (what I call it) hairspray. There is a lot in the can (I&#x27;m still on my original can), and I shampoo my hair 3x&#x27;s/week. A little goes a long way, since there is no added water in their products. (Why pay for something that&#x27;s free like water?) It&#x27;s easy to use, not oily or greasy, and does not make your hair or hands sticky. God, I HATE when that happens.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I use Kenra&#x27;s moisterizing shampoo and conditioner-nothing, and I mean NOTHING is greater than their shampoo,conditioner, and mousse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give them the highest stars, and that&#x27;s a real test, &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t score high unless I would stake my name on it!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have fine hair.  This stuff adds body and shine.  It is now one of my basic hair products.  Buy it!!</li>
    <li> GREAT mousse for espec.  for thin hair.  My hair stylist highly recommends this product for my hair  Males styling your hair easier.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite product for my hair.. perfect weight for my limp blonde hair. I&#x27;ve tried many products that claim to offer volume but this is truly my favorite. Doesn&#x27;t weight down hair or make it feel greasy in any way. Without this my hair is so FLAT.. bought this product four times now and when I start getting low I have to admit I go into full panic attack mode! The difference is amazing! Prices on Amazon are usually cheaper than local cosmetic specialty store. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> The only mousse I use since I discovered it.</li>
    <li> I use this in my hair before styling--love it!</li>
    <li> This is definitely the best mousse I have ever used. I have wavy hair that tends to frizz. This product conditions without weighing hair down and provides a flexible hold.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way. This product is not sticky and gives my hair good body.</li>
    <li> Really great styling mousse, I have been using it for years and have tried other products but this is the best to style and hold your style.</li>
    <li> The cap or trigger was damaged some in shipping, is now foaming better than at first. It is a good moisse</li>
    <li> Great product was just little slow in delivery</li>
    <li> This product works by turning hair into straw.  Though it does create some volume, the texture is awful.  Very disappointing for a Kenra product.</li>
    <li> I received my order right away!  Very happy</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell and it made my hair very sticky</li>
    <li> Fast service, as expected</li>
    <li> I have been using Kenra Volume Mousse Extra Firm Hold Fixative Hair Styling Mousse for many years and it works very well  I am very pleased with this product</li>
    <li> I received this product as described. very happy with how quick i received. would recommend purchasing for anyone that is looking to buy.</li>
    <li> Terrible! Should have listened to the reviews and saved my money...</li>
    <li> this is the best Mousse ever. Hair stays in place without stickiness. Gives volumne.. and keeps hair flexible. Worth buying.</li>
    <li> Use this every day. Happens it works for me</li>
    <li> Really like Kenra products.</li>
    <li> Love Kenra products but this made my hair feel greasy and heavy. I have normal hair and it seemed to weigh it down and feel dirty. It didn&#x27;t flake and it did actually hold the volume just felt greasy. Would not repurchase this.</li>
    <li> She Who Must Be Obeyed obviously loved it, because she didn&#x27;t complain to me about it!</li>
    <li> bought this thinking it would be better than pantene which i have used for years.  It is not!  i am going with the cheaper and better pantene!</li>
    <li> It is denser and adds real body to your hair. I bought it online to avoid the price at the salons.</li>
    <li> This mouse does a good job of making my hair look fuller.  I can get an extra day before I have to shampoo it again.</li>
    <li> Works great and provides volume</li>
    <li> This product gives my hair more volume and leaves my hair soft and shiny. It also smell good. The reason&lt;br /&gt;I did not give it five stars is because sometimes the applicator stops working. I was able to fix it with a q tip&lt;br /&gt;and warm water under the applicator.</li>
    <li> I love this.Makes my hair shiny and full of body.  Will buy more of the line. It&#x27;s the best mouse I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
    <li> This Kenra Product is exceptional!!! provides great volume with little quantity needed to produce the result. I am using all of Kenra Products for the same reason of producing excellent results in hair management.</li>
    <li> Great for curly hair!</li>
    <li> Love Kenra. Great product, and it smells great too.</li>
    <li> Holds just like it claims</li>
    <li> My favorite mousse because it is not sticky, not greasy, pleasant scent, and holds my natural waves well after shampooing.  I have short hair and can create different hairdos.  If my hair dries before I&#x27;m done styling, I wet the circular brush lightly and redo the do!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still torn, the first use was terrible. Very sticky made my hair look nappy&lt;br /&gt;Second use a little better&lt;br /&gt;I like the stiffness but it&#x27;s like if u miss one area of hair it messes it all up&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to explain&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick and curly hair&lt;br /&gt;I provably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again :(</li>
