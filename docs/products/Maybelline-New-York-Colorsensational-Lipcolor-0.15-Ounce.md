      <li>Great price</li>
      <li>Very nice shade.</li>
      <li>so I was thrilled to find it here and have it again!</li>
      <li>Got muy lipstick today the color is not as beautiful as I thought the pic looks much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful color that goes on smoothly without being sticky.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I love Madison Mauve!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this color from Maybelline!</li>

      <li>love this color!</li>
      <li>An amazing color I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere.  </li>
      <li>and it couldve been an honest mistake.</li>
      <li>so it was kind of messed up but looking at it, it didn&#x27;t looked used</li>
      <li>It has a nice consistency (not slimy, not drying)</li>
      <li>Nice color.</li>
      <li>Nice creamy formula, love Maybelline lipsticks.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite colors</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>Feels great on my lips and my item came extremely fast but... it wasn&#x27;t sealed and it looked like it was pushed up on the case&#x27;s top</li>
      <li>I bought it in a brick store before and love it but couldn&#x27;t find again until now.</li>
      <li>Love this lipstick can&#x27;t find this one in the store</li>
      <li>I love the color.</li>
      <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend Maybelline lipsticks, they make great colors.</li>
      <li>It is more &amp;#34;mauve-y&amp;#34;, which is not a bad thing, but not as stunning as in the pic.</li>
      <li>Came very quickly..</li>
      <li>No longer available in stores--</li>
      <li>The price is great and this Madison Mauve shade goes well with all skin tones and can be woren anytime of the day, especially evening into night.</li>
      <li>It goes well with my brown hair and light complexion.</li>
      <li>I also have Lavender Voltage and that color is rich and on the matte side.</li>
      <li>the shipping was quick though.</li>
      <li>I have light skin and dark hair and this color is gorgeous for my complexion.  </li>
      <li>The color is just slightly lighter than the picture, but this is a beautiful shade and very long-lasting.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great quality lipstick that I apply once in the morning and usually once after lunch, and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
      <li>I received the item super fast.</li>
      <li>Exactly the color I wanted.  </li>
      <li>This product is exactly what it looks like - a metallic lipstick.</li>
      <li>I wish it was dark like the picture, or even more purple-y like the picture.</li>
      <li>As a person of color (with darker lips), the color is a little sheer, but this is an overall great product.</li>
      <li>These had to be old, but wearable.</li>
      <li>THE  PICTURE SHOWN IS FAR FROM WHAT</li>
      <li>much darker than expected</li>
      <li>Item is not vibrant purple as pictured it is a neutral mauve and the formula of the actual lipstick is very sticky</li>
      <li>The LS is not dry at all just not the look</li>

    <li> I wish it was dark like the picture, or even more purple-y like the picture. It&#x27;s also a lot sheerer than I thought it would be. I also have Lavender Voltage and that color is rich and on the matte side. I was hoping this one would be that way too but it&#x27;s not.</li>
    <li> not a lipstick at all. thought it was.</li>
    <li> I found that when I look in the stores this color is no longer being stock.  love this color!</li>

    <li> la punta del labial estaba un poco aplastada</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color from Maybelline! My daughter wore it and I had to have it for myself! It&#x27;s a shame that it&#x27;s a discontinued shade. I&#x27;ve stocked up!</li>
