<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times since I received it and I&#x27;m very impressed! I have really long, thick hair and it always feels frizzy. The very first time I used this I noticed a difference. My hair was so much easier to brush through, and it felt really soft. I let my hair air dry and instead of the frizzy nest it would normally be, it actually looked nice and shiny. Everytime I use it I&#x27;m more impressed. I&#x27;ve even had people comment how healthy and good my hair looks. I recommend it to everyone and will continue using it myself.</li>
    <li> Amazing!  I have some pretty thick, wild, curly hair that I tend to cover in mousse, hairspray ect every day which ahs made it very dry and brittle.  After a few days of use I can already tell a major difference.  It is smoother and less frizzy.  I am really loving it.</li>
    <li> my hair loves this product</li>
    <li> This was a good product. Definitely left my hair feeling moisturized. I was pleasantly surprised that this did not leave a &amp;#34;greasy residue&amp;#34; feel when using it. The only downside would be the scent. It wasn&#x27;t a bad scent, but it would have been nice to have a better smell to it.</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel soft. A good treatment to use as a pre-shampoo moisturizer for those with coarse, chemical- or color- treated hair.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency keeps my hydrated love it</li>
    <li> Love this product helped to correct the rough split end. My hairs ends were very damaged due to an extended illness this product went a long way in making my hair look and feel healthy again.</li>
    <li> The argan oil has great properties as hair product and this one is a very good one. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 is because its a bit too hard to rinse.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my hair.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine has this product and her hair is AMAZING. I&#x27;ve been looking everywhere for this product and now I found it :) I personally have not tried it on my hair but my friend&#x27;s hair looks so amazing. It&#x27;s soft, frizz free and looks extremely healthy. She has course, thick hair that was badly damaged by dying it so much. She bought this and it transformed her hair within weeks. And now I can&#x27;t wait to try it! I received a promo code for this product and this review is solely of my own opinion.</li>
    <li> too expensive for the size &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work that good.</li>
    <li> So far i really like the product. I find it hard to leave in for 15 mins after i shampoo so it is a little mroe time consuming than i originally though. However so worth it. I have died my hair several times and this makes my hair feel so soft and lively again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! My hair gets so dried out and this stuff makes it so soft.</li>
    <li> I didnt have a boost in volume but it did help my ends</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Exceptional product!</li>
    <li> This is my third day using this product, so far I like it a lot. My hair is super soft and it sells yummy. Would purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!! Makes my hair feel so soft! Helps when I flat iron my hair! Great product!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not very conditioning like I thought it would be. Its a light cream serum. Not much of any scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I haven&#x27;t noticed any hair grown beyond what&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice to use in the mornings before I brush my hair.  It helps smooth out my hair.</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil is the best thing for your hair. This left my hair soft, shiny and manageable. This is a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> the box was teared and it looks like someone&#x27;s return, will try later...........</li>
    <li> Love it. The smell is awesome and love how long this will last. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I liked this product, the only thing i didnt enjoy was the smell..</li>
    <li> Product was more like a geaseless lotion that is applied after you wash your hair. I thought I was purchasing actual oil. Either way it made my hair softer after washing it.</li>
    <li> After reading Argan Oil, I was hooked. This is the best oil treatment that I have found for hair. I use it on my facial hair, and the wife uses it on her hair. It works the same on both, GREAT!!! The secret of Argan oil is out so the prices will soar. I recommend that you but this stuff up while it is still available at such a good price. Not only does this hair treatment contain Argan oil, one of the worlds most expensive and best healing and protective oils known to man, it also contains organic Aloe Juice, organic Castor Oil, organic Coconut Oil and Pro-Vitamin B5. With a combination like that how could you go wrong? It makes my beard soft and manageable, with all of the dreaded &amp;#34;beard itch&amp;#34; gone after the first use. My wife loves this stuff and swears by it now, she said it is one of the best hair treatments that she has ever used, making her hair soft, manageable, strong, repairs split ends and shiny.So this product is a winner in my book. I can honestly highly recommend this product. I count on Amazon reviews when I make purchases, and know that others do the same. I would never want to influence anyone to make a product purchase, which I don&#x27;t believe is worth buying. If my review is helpful, let me know by checking helpful. This review expresses my real opinion about this product.</li>
    <li> I received my morocco Argan Oil and was very impressed! The smell was Great and it has a spray pump on it to make it easier to put on without getting my hands all sticky. Sprayed it in left it on for 15 minutes and washed it out my hair smelled and felt so soft. I also leave it on overnight with s showercap and it conditions it Great! Definitely A Great Product.</li>
    <li> All  i can say is LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and for the price I&#x27;d buy it again. It works magic on my course hair.</li>
    <li> The product was not exactly what I needed;  provides little moisture to the hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is looking incredible and I credit this mask for it. Its not every day that I find products that work on my wavy prone to greasy hair, but this one does.</li>
    <li> Hey guys, my name is Sabrina and I got this today and just tryed it. So far I love it. It smelled ok, not bad tho, it took a lot more then what I expected to get on all my hair(I have thin about shoulder length hair) but other then that I let it set on my head after I washed my hair for about ten mins while I finished my shower and then rinsed my hair and dryed it and it feels smooth and soft. I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner. But I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if anything changes and if it does or don&#x27;t I&#x27;ll update my review. But as of right now I love it and want to keep using it. As of right now I would definitely recommend and I hope it makes my hair healthy and pretty. It just sucks how much it cost lol the package came in support fast, was packaged great thank you free trail of Amazon prime and three only region do fast that I have docked a star is because it took so much to cover my head and the size of the bottle isn&#x27;t that big and the smell isn&#x27;t awesome but it is in no way bad what so ever.. Would recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I love to try natural products for my daughters hair. This argan oil treatment is amazing! My daughter is biracial and has quite curly hair that is always in need of moisture products. This treatment left her hair soft and manageable with amazing shine! I love argan oil for all the benefits it provides.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my beauty care regimen!</li>
    <li> I have tried many conditioners and olive oil, but there aren&#x27;t any that can soothe my hair so far.  Looking forward to try this one out, and hope it helps.</li>
    <li> I am really big on products for my hair. This Aragon oil for the hair is excellent. It restores yiur dry and damage hair due to dying or just dry blowing. After you shampoo you leave it in yiur hair for 10 minutes and you rinse it out. You really feel the difference in your hair. Your hair becomes softer and much more manageable.</li>
    <li> Extremely nourishing, especially for dry/brittle hair. I tend to have really dry ends, but a somewhat oily scalp. Moroccan argan oil is moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy. Be careful not to use too much, though, because a little bit goes a long way. This bottle will last you a while. It&#x27;s good to use on damp hair right out of the shower or even on dry hair to help with styling.</li>
    <li> This product is very thin. Not thick enough to be considered a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;. The packaging comes with a tiny little pump to dispense. I had to press the pump about 60 times to get enough product out for my hair. After using this product, my hair didn&#x27;t feel much different than if I would use my regular conditioner. I will probably use this product as a leave in product for styling my hair ...it is that light.</li>
    <li> Works well. A little goes a long way. Smooth and shine without the greasy look.</li>
    <li> This is amazing...My hair is very thin and dry and it looks and feels healthier since using this product.</li>
    <li> I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I was really excited to try this. I prefer natural products that are chemical free. This seemed to be right up my alley. I must disclose I have very thick hair. I also have hair that becomes greasy if it is not washed every other day so I have not had any issues with dry hair. I like hair masks to keep my hair looking shiny. With that said my first issue was the little pump was taking too long to pump out the amount of product I needed. I had to unscrew the cap and pour it out and it took half the bottle to cover my hair root to tips and I have a bob that isn&#x27;t even shoulder length. Considering the price that issue alone makes me not want to repurchase it. My second issue was this we all know how it feels to apply conditioner or a treatment. It was not thick or smooth. Usually when applying a hair mask it feels smooth and goes on smooth. This product did not have silicates listed in the ingredients so I think that is why. Silicates are supposed to be bad for you so that kind of cancels out the badness of the texture. It did not smell overwhelmingly bad. However, it did not smell good either. When my hair had dried it was shiny which is a plus. However, it seemed to weigh my hair down as it was flat I have natural volume so this really bummed me out. Is it great? No. Is it bad? No. Its average and considering the fact it is free of nasty chemicals it actually did a pretty decent job giving me shine. My hair certainly does not feel any softer either.  I can tell that it did something but not much. I am somewhat &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; a mother who prefers natural and organic things. Basically this products called out to my crunchy mama soul. I wanted to love it. I think if you have hair issues like frizz and split ends this may work well. If you are trying to go noo poo this may work for you too. If your trying to go green or avoid chemicals this may be worth a try. I just think I never realized I had good hair until I tried this. I think I am one of those people who really doesn&#x27;t need conditioner. Therefore, it did little for me. The shine is nice though. I really like the premise and I think that out of the over 400 reviewers here I am one of the minority that it just didn&#x27;t wow.hair until I tried this.

    <li> Recieved this product through SnagShout for just $1 after applying the gift code given me. I washed my hair with my regular shampoo and used this generously as directed. Kinda felt like I was gonna pump forever because I have shoulder length and thick curly hair. Looked like conditioner and smells good but felt kinda thin as I put it on. I combed it through thoroughly and also applied just a few pumps more just to rub over the top and ends. I continued to do my shower ritual of shaving my legs, pits, and of course washing up. So I had the conditioner in for about 10-15 minute before I finally rinsed it out. I felt like it was a lil dry so I applied a little dab of my own conditioner to my hair afterwards. I towel dried my hair and proceeded to get dressed and looked in the mirror and realized the amazing curls looking so springy and healthy. I am very suprised by the end result as I havent seen these curls since I was a young child. This is going to become one of my must have products. I did just discover this could be used even as a leave in conditioner :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty good! I have personally never tried argan oil. The bottle is pretty big compare to other bottles I&#x27;ve tried. The instructions are easy to read &amp; use. Leaves your hair feeling so silk and soft. Also give your hair smelling good! Best part you leave it on your hair in the shower for only a small amount of time while you can be doing something else. Bottle size looks like it can last pretty long time!</li>
    <li> This product does nothing for my hair and it smells horrible. My hair feels dry after I let it air dry.</li>
    <li> I have thin, frizzy, dry hair but this makes it shiny and not frizzy I don&#x27;t like the smell too much but it&#x27;s not that bad.. I like the results</li>
    <li> I recently died my hair blonde which left it a little dry. I have used this product for three days and it has helped my hair feel smoother and more hydrated. It even works as an overnight treatment, I just put it on my hair then put on a shower cap while I slept, washed as normal in the morning and my hair felt really soft. In my opinion there is does not have a smell to it.</li>
    <li> Works really well! I use it twice per week. I have a mild case of Eczema and it affects my scalp often. This product is great for knocking it out. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I am a natural and this product really moisturizes and added shine to my hair. The only downside that I have for this product is that its not enough product. After 1 to 2 uses the product is gone.</li>
    <li> Love it. The consistency is great and smoooth. Does not give you any irritation or problems to your skin. Also smell good. Recommend it to all who has dry and damaged scalp.</li>
    <li> My hair has never been softer! I use this product about 3 times a week and i leave it in my hair after I shampoo for about 5 mins then rinse. My hair is shiny, thicker, and all together just healthier and the product smells great too! I am thoroughly happy with this product and will continue to use it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> Amazing for my hair extensions</li>
    <li> This argon oil is awesome  i use it a few time a week in my hair to keep the frizzz down. It works awesome  and also smells good.</li>
    <li> I loved how it made my hair feel after wards. I like that it didn&#x27;t take much of it, nor did it take a long time for me to tell a difference. I also like that it didn&#x27;t give out an extremely large amount at a time.</li>
    <li> I had really high hopes for this product with all the other great reviews on here. But I am unfortunately not writing the glowing review I had hoped I would. I have been relatively unhappy with my hair for a while. I&#x27;ve tried countless different hair products to try to get it to be softer and less frizzy but nothing has completely worked for me. And when I got this I really hoped it would finally be the product to get my hair back to being soft and frizz-free but it is not. I tried this product about 5 or 6 different times and the last time that I used it I felt that my hair was less frizzy than the previous times I used it so it might be that it just takes multiple uses to really have a big impact on your hair. Or maybe my hair was just that damaged that it takes so many applications of the product to get it to work like it&#x27;s supposed to. But after using this product my hair was still frizzy and not nearly as soft as I was hoping for. I also have naturally wavy hair and I&#x27;m looking for a product that stops frizz so I can start wearing my hair natural more often instead of always using heat on it, but this product straightened my hair out more. I don&#x27;t know why but every time that it dried my hair lost a lot of its wave. My hair has also gotten pretty long so I need to apply a lot of product to my hair and it&#x27;s really difficult to do that with this bottle. It squirts a very small amount out each time so its very inconvenient to repeatedly get the product out of the bottle. I&#x27;m still giving this 3 stars though because I feel like there is potential with this product to start having some more positive effects on my hair if I keep using it but I don&#x27;t plan on bothering with it anymore.</li>
    <li> Very good price ! My hair feels more fuller stronger and more healthy</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughters hair which is fine and can get frizzy. I have seen a improvement since using this oil. It&#x27;s shinny and beautiful now! I will say that it is a pump bottle but doesn&#x27;t spray, it comes out thick which isn&#x27;t a problem.</li>
    <li> I like the smell. Its just that I have thick curly hair, its too thin to manage my hair. I need a lot to cover my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair feels great. So soft and shiny. I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter who swims regularly in a chlorinated pool hours on end... her hair is dry and very damaged,  Followed the directions on the bottle of having to wait the 15 mins (a bit tedious) and her hair was noticeably softer/less frizzy!</li>
    <li> Ive used this before and i love it. Smells great and leaves my hair silky</li>
    <li> Really good softened my hair as well made it shine. I love the smell. Over all I&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
    <li> I used this once and left it on for the full 15 minutes. It smells amazing and my hair is restored and luxurious. I really needed a nice treatment my hair was very dry and dull. It is shiny and hydrated now.</li>
    <li> The texture is nice and make my hair really soft.  It is a little heavy for my fine hair so maybe i will only use it once a week instead of daily.  It has a clean scent and isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Overall i like it very much and will consider buying it again.</li>
    <li> This came very quickly and had no problems with it leaking or being damaged in any other way, but I have to agree with the comments about the small amount of product that you get.  The bottle was not entirely full and since there appears to be no leaks i have to assume that is simply the way it is packaged. Received a discount for testing/review and still think there is not enough to be practical for regular use.  However I do have very long and thick hair so obviously this is more of a concern for me than those who wear a shorter style.&lt;br /&gt;  After just 1 use I was amazed how soft it left my hair, which tends to be very dry.  I would prefer a stronger scent but that&#x27;s not a huge deal,  I did not notice any additional shine after a week or so but my hair  continues to be incredibly soft.  This however, did not have a detangling effect .  It does make it slightly easier to brush, but its soft and kind of ......  fluffy?  I think this took away some buildup from previous products which is great but now it tangles easier if left down.</li>
    <li> Received on time and tried product twice already, love it so far!</li>
    <li> This is awesome makes your hair strong,silky and easy to manage.</li>
    <li> Great product. Left my hair feeling soft and moisturized. Shipping was fast too</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING for my hair!!! My hair has some heat damage from my hair straightener and my hair dryer. I tried this out after I got home from work just incase I didnt like how it was in my hair. My hair is left feeling silky and the shine is phenomenal! Its silky straight and so soft!!!! This is the real deal if you want soft silky shiny hair!</li>
    <li> Just like the 3 stars say, it&#x27;s okay. Didn&#x27;t help my hair but it didn&#x27;t harm it either. Will probably amp it up with something or just add it to another product for a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have used Argan oil and Moroccan oil in the past on my hair and I love the finish it gives it so I thought I would give this one a try. I did receive a discount on the product for writing a review as well. First of all, this isn&#x27;t the best or worst product I have tried and I have only used it twice so far (which I usually can see a difference with in my usual product I use). Although Argan oil is the first ingredient, there is so much else that is is hard to tell the actual amount and it doesn&#x27;t tell you on the box anywhere. It is only 4 oz in a bottle with a pump applicator and it takes MANY pumps to get a sufficient amount to use in an application. The bottle is not full, but its capacity is more than 4 oz so you are not being shorted by that as some have stated.&lt;br /&gt;What you notice once you dispense the product is the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; , not pleasant as with other oils I&#x27;ve used. Reading the label this one has castor oil in it and may be the source. It also has wheat protein if you are super sensitive to that as well. The scent doesn&#x27;t last long so leaving it on my hair for the 10-15 minutes wasn&#x27;t a problem. Combing hair seemed to work well (no real tangles in my thick, curly hair). I have not noticed a real sheen change yet, and will update if there is one. This bottle would last me maybe 2 months with using 2x a week.</li>
    <li> This lotion like treatment smells like an unscented lotion with a faint hint of argan oil. It comes in a pump that pumps out a pea sized amount each time and you&#x27;re supposed to apply it generously. I had to pump it 30 times and I have thick shoulder length hair. You&#x27;re supposed to leave it in for 5-15 minutes. I did the entire 15 and my hair really was soft after it dried. I do love this stuff though.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Had to use a lot but I liked the results. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily just left it soft and shiny. I received a discount for this review.</li>
    <li> My hair drinks this up like water. The directions say to rinse after applying. I notice more results if I use it after I shower on towel dry hair and leave it in as a leave in conditioner. My hair was super dry and breaking before and I can see noticeable results and how smoother and softer my hair is now.</li>
    <li> I absolutely have fallen in love with this product. It left my hair smooth and soft and a lot more manageable. It works great especially when ypit hair is very damaged.</li>
    <li> I have very dry and frizzy hair, this product helps reduce that... If you live in Texas, you will enjoy this product.. It leaves my hair smooth, shiny and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
    <li> I have very dry hair and my hair breaks off a lot, I used the Argan Oil Hair Restore and I have to say I love it.  After I shampooed my hair, I applied this oil to my hair for 15 mins.  I washed it out and dried my hair with the hair dryer, when done, Without putting anything in my hair, I noticed a huge difference right away and it looked healthy... This worked good on me.</li>
    <li> My hair has been very dry from summer activities and the heat but this oil left it feeling very soft after just one use. The only downside was that it didn&#x27;t smell too great.. but, it&#x27;s something to overlook for a product that truly works.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair treatment. After I shampoo my hair I put this treatment on. I leave it on my hair for 20 minutes and rinse it out. This product leaves my hair soft!</li>
    <li> This masque leaves my curly hair soft and detangled, without excessive oiliness. The scent is clean and somewhat neutral, which is a plus! Some argan oil products are overly perfumed, this is not! The plus - it feels like it absorbs into the hair shaft, rather than just coating. Hair is easily more manageable after a few treatments. There is a noticeable softness after use. The downside - I can&#x27;t give it 5 star because it doesn&#x27;t control frizz the way I had hoped. Living in South Florida, frizz is a big problem and I have only found a few products that can block the humidity. This product doesn&#x27;t do that.</li>
    <li> This is a great product however I&#x27;m dissapointed that I didn&#x27;t know you have to wash it back out of your hair after you put it in. It&#x27;s really inconvenient , so for that im giving it less stars.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this oil. It works great makes my hair so soft. And seals in the proper amount of moister . I did receive for review</li>
    <li> i must say this product really works my daughter has really curly frizzy hair and it stoped the puffeyness that she gets as the day goes on i would definitly buy this product again  and the price was really good thank you finally i found something that works in my daughters hair after trying so many other products that failed A+ for the product</li>
    <li> The Best Morocco Argan Oil  made a difference in my hair, softer and more manageable.  I tried it once as a hair mask and rinsed it out.  That worked fine. But I found I like a few pumps of product thru my damp hair ( I have very short hair) after washing, then blow drying and styling without washing it out, made my hair soft and not greasy.  I will continue to use it this way.  Nice product.</li>
    <li> It worked great. I do have very thick and long hair so it requires a lot of product. The bottle is small and I require a lot of product so it wont last more then a week or so, my hair felt better after one use!</li>
    <li> this stuff is incedible for my long thick curly hair i would reccommend it to anyone who has hair likemine</li>
    <li> Makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> leaves hair so shiny and smooth</li>
    <li> Use it for the first time last night and my hair feels great, very soft from root to ends.  I flat iron my hair almost every day so this will definitely help with my dry ends</li>
    <li> I really love this product. I tend to wash and go with my hair in this summer and was excited to see how my curls would react to this product. I left it on a little longer because I got side tracked, but I was very pleased. My hair seemed to absorb the product better after washing the Pure &amp; Essential Minerals out. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting to see some changes in their hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Morocco aragan oil on my hair twice and love it my hair before i tried this was coarse, dried and had no shine after use it feels soft and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> It restored my damaged hair, I am a believer!!!!  I expected to have to wait 1-2 weeks for results, but the first time I used it I noticed a significant difference, my hair is silky and smooth (not oily).  I&#x27;m hooked on Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> This product makes my hair so smooth and frizz free! It&#x27;s the best my hair has looked in a couple years</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone who it trying to correct damage done to their hair. It only takes a small amount so the bottle goes a very long way.... Although I got this item at a reduced price for my review it is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone who has over processed hair due to sun damage or hair color treatments.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. I have used it 3 tines since I&#x27;ve received and my hair is super shiny and looks healthy! Gotten many compliments on my hairs look!</li>
    <li> Its very moisture my hair and make it more soft.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!! Leaves your hair really soft.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, great for dry hair.</li>
    <li> Great product - can&#x27;t wait to start using this!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have really long hair so I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. But it instantly makes my hair feel softer, and it detangles it. It is awesome! It does make it feel smoother and makes my hair last longer in between washes. I will definitely be adding this to my permanent hair routine. I did receive a discounted price when I bought it, good deal!</li>
    <li> I love the soft creamy texture of this product. It smells wonderful and you do not have to apply a lot of this. I used it for the ends of my hair 2x a week and have seen and improvement in a short bit of time. I will be ordering more of this.</li>
    <li> I bought the Morocco Argan Oil Hair Treatment when I saw it on Snagshout. For less than $2, why not buy it?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product 2 days after I ordered it! Because who likes waiting forever for something you purchased?! I used it the first night I got it. The smell isn&#x27;t all that great, but it really did leave my hair soft and smooth. I normally have a huge tangle or knot in my hair after I shower, but I didn&#x27;t have any trouble brushing it after using the hair treatment.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. I don&#x27;t use it as a mask. I apply one or two squirts on my hair when it looks dry and it looks great.</li>
    <li> Did seem to make my hair a little sleeker, but not a huge change. It had a bit of an unexpected chemical-like smell which I wasn&#x27;t a fan of.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a few days now and I like the outcome on the days I used it. It leave my hair very shiny and soft...VERY shiny. I do not use it every day. I like the fact that it is made with natural ingredients and it is good for my hair. My hair is thick medium length and I have to use a lot of the product to cover my mane, which I find very sad because the bottle itself is not very big. I do like the outcome and will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> this made my hair feel so smooth loved it</li>
    <li> It has left my hair smoother; however, I still have to apply additional products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not leave my hair as soft as desired.</li>
    <li> My hair has always been on the dry side -- getting it colored every 5 weeks doesn&#x27;t help.  When given the chance to try Pure Aragan Oil Mask Treatment at a discounted price in return for my unbiased review I was excited.  After several treatments my hair looks terrific.  It&#x27;s shiny, soft and manageable without any sign of dryness or frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is very easy to use, smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I started out using it daily and then decreased to twice a week. I am very happy and will continue to use it, but I have a few concerns that are not directly related to the product results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Amazon product ad it says that it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Leave in Conditioner&amp;#34; but the directions on the bottle say to leave it in 5-15 minutes and then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;-- The bottle wasn&#x27;t full. About 20% of the product gone before I even started using it.&lt;br /&gt;-- I will get about 10-12 treatments on my mid-length hair. Right now the price is 60% off on Amazon ($14.97) which is an affordable, but at the full price of $40 it could get expensive really fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this item at a reduced price in return for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I must start by saying my hair is course and curly and was (key word, was) in very good condition since I don&#x27;t use product.  I went and got it colored professionally for the first time in years and the aftermath was a dry brittle frizzy mess (I cried, yes).  I was desperate, saw this on line, and had to try it. For someone who has thick, long, course hair, you will not get more than two uses out of it however, I didn&#x27;t need more than that even though I am ordering more.  My hair is back to predye condition and is as curly as ever.  To me this was a miracle product.  When I paid $15 for this product, for the results I received I pay 10 times that.</li>
    <li> My hair feels so healthy now. Been using it for the past week daily and my hair is super strong and healthy. I let it air dry after washing out the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I Love this! My hair looks and feels great. My hair has been over processed with color for years but using this product has begun to heal the split ends and lifelessness. I would greatly recommend this to everyone for perpetual care, even for healthy and virgin hair. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> Not overly impressed with his hair product.  It left my hair in knotty clumps after leaving it in for 8 minutes (the mid point of the 5-15 minutes recommended.  I was expecting smoother, shinier hair after using this.</li>
    <li> smells great and feels nice too. great cs and quick delivery also</li>
    <li> First of all, when I got the package it  was like 25% of the bottle empty. My first thought was that it was already used. When I used it the first time I felt like it wasn&#x27;t going to work because of the texture.  However,  it detangle my hair and made it smooth.  When it dried my hair looked  with frizz. Now I have used it 3 times and my hair looks much better. It seems thicker. It doesn’t have a good smell which I think it will be better.  The instructions on the bottle says to shampoo and then apply this product and wash. I actually used a conditioner after and it works much better. I only paid  $1 for it and that&#x27;s ok. But am not sure I will pay full price since I could only used it 5 times in total</li>
    <li> Does not work. Tried it different ways. Smell is not that nice. Think it might be a fake product from China.  Confused why there are so many raving reviews. This product provided less conditioning than bar soap. I gave it a chance and used it for quite some time.  It did nothing. Can I return it?</li>
    <li> i was i little iffy trying this argon oil for the first time.i didnt know if it would leave my hair greasy or what but following the easy dirrections i would not belive how my hir turned out so silky an smooth this will definaly be party of my everday routine silky and shinny i love it. i recieved this product as a discount for an honest unbia opinion</li>
    <li> Loved it! Beautiful packaging and high quality Argan Oil. Smells great and works wonders for shine and strength in your hair.</li>
    <li> Great product feels great in your hair (non greasy) leaves hair feeling soft and full of body and smells nice</li>
    <li> Update:  I went to buy this product, and it&#x27;s not the same as the one reviewed below.  The mask I tried was in a white, creamy conditioner form.  The current product photo looks like straight argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how this argan oil hair mask makes my hair silky, manageable, and even easier to style in only 5-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, about my hair:  I have shoulder-length, untreated (no dyes, no perms, no straight ironing) hair.  It&#x27;s that kind of hair that looks like it should be straight but which never is drying every last strand with a brush and blow dryer.  I have a lot of hair, so it looks thick, but the hair itself is fine and flyaway.  I absolutely must use a conditioner to keep it in check.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, the results:  All I need to do is shampoo my hair and comb in the hair mask.  After 5-15 minutes, I rinse it out.  I can feel the effects instantly.  My hair has NEVER felt that silky after using a conditioner.  Because I don&#x27;t have dry or damaged hair, I keep the mask in my hair for 5-10 minutes, but if you have hair that&#x27;s crying for additional moisture, I advise leaving it in for the longer time.  When I get out of the shower, I can run a comb easily through my hair.  Blow drying results in a lustrous -- and this is important to me -- straight look.  Yes, I still have to style my hair with the hair dryer, but my hair takes to it much better than it did with other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair mask comes in a jar.  This is the only thing I wasn&#x27;t wild about:  the mask is the consistency of a cream conditioner, but I have to scoop it out of the pot with my fingers.  It&#x27;s not easy transferring the mask from pot to hair without losing some along the way.  If this came in a squeeze bottle, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all oil treatments, I was a little leery that my hair would look greasy afterward.  (I&#x27;ve tried straight argan oil, and I didn&#x27;t like the results.)  Not to worry!  My hair looks and feels normal -- only better.  Note:  I received a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmannew.    -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
    <li> Just started using this and can Tell a difference in my hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft and not oily.</li>
    <li> Absolutely loved how it made my hair feel. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> very lightweight, smells delicious. I use it twice a week for 10 minutes and leaves my hair so soft and smooth. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have heard that this product works well which is why I ordered it. I have a coworker that says Argan Oil has essential Omega 3 benefits in it and other benefits so I am definitely trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the fact that it has organic qualities is what I really like and appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking for something not just to make my hair look healthy but make it better and healthy and to strengthen it. I will continue testing it and follow-up with some progress later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for this review</li>
    <li> Got this for my daughters hair. Last year she shaved her head in order to start fresh with no dyes or bleaching. This is a great moisturizing spray that doesn&#x27;t leave her hair greasy like so many do.</li>
    <li> This was very different than I thought it would be, but that&#x27;s a good thing! I was expecting an oil, but it&#x27;s more like a cream. It&#x27;s easier to apply that way. The only thing is I wish it had a pleasant smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just has no smell whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I was told by so many about Argon oil and the affects it has on the hair. Especially long and thin like mine.  I thought Yeah right this works that well they are just conditioning really well.  I found I could get this under a great promotional rate and I thought what the heck I can do that and if I dont like it what am I out?I want the world to know how much I love this and I will be buying till they stop making it.  So once it came I had to try it. Wow what a difference.  So glad I tried this and it proved that I was wrong. Love it. My hair is soft shiny and very manageable. My hair when it dries out tangles so easily. This is why I heavily condition. This is really awesome! I have shared this with famly and friends and now i want everyone else to know how good this product is. Once this is out I plan on purchasing more.</li>
    <li> I used this in the shower. It goes on after shampooing. It leaves my hair manageable. My hair was dry from coloring it. It is looking very healthy and full of body. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it made my hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Pricey. To get good results you will need to use an ounce each treatment for shoulder length hair.</li>
    <li> I washed my hair with just Pantene deep clarifying shampoo first and then applied this morrocan deep conditioning mask. I have tangle prone hair. After I applied the product and was combing through my hair, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to help because my hair still seemed knotty. However after I left it on for about 10 minutes and washed it out my hair was super manageable. My hair was shiny and soft!!</li>
    <li> Digging this hair mask. Its smooth and sleek going on and it leaves my hair so easy to brush through and smelling great... I like the way my hair felt after using it. I have abused my hair through out the years of blowdrying and flat irons. I need good products that allow me to brush through my hair easily and doesn&#x27;t make my head completely oily. Ill definitely will buy again.</li>
    <li> Moisturizing for the hair</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> My overall results are that it made my hair incredibly soft, detangled well &amp; I had much less frizz after it dried.  I have pretty dry hair and after one treatment of this , it is like I just left the professional salon</li>
    <li> I loved how soft this product made my hair feel after just one day! My hair has felt a lot healthier! I would buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Got this super cheap through snagshout. I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in my hair and wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. Still had to use conditioner afterwards.</li>
    <li> This argan oil is very nice. I used it on my hair to heal split ends and moisturize my hair and scalp.</li>
    <li> I have really dry hair. I previously used olive oil or coconut oil to hydrate my hair to go with a natural solution. This oil has helped my hair a lot with split ends. Nice smelling and great packaging. I did receive this item in exchange on how I honestly felt about the product.</li>
    <li> Ok first off, I have very frizzy hair due to processing and nothing seems to work so I was skeptical about this product working as stated. It took two treatments to get the good results but it does work! It tamed the frizz a good bit and made my hair more shiny...I imagine with continued use, these results will get better. The only thing is, I did not receive the &amp;#34;bonus ebook&amp;#34; that was stated on the purchase page I would receive.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 10 days or so and I like they way my hair feels. I read another review saying that it didn&#x27;t work well after 2 days of use.  I know for me, I could never judge a product after 2 days of use. I have to give things at least a week and more like 2 weeks to be able to tell whether it works or not.  After 10 days of use, I can say that I like it.  Here are the pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s organic&lt;br /&gt;The argan oil really does leave your hair feeling substantially softer&lt;br /&gt;Even though its relatively thick, it doesn&#x27;t leave a thick residue on your hair like some conditioners&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent.  It&#x27;s not perfumed but it has a pleasant scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is very small.  I have finished it after 10 days of use (but I do have long hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have decided to use some chemicals in it which is very unfortunate.  Most of the ingredients are naturally derived but the last two ingredients are: stearalkonium chloride and phenxyethanol.  The argan oil and aloe and coconut oil in this product are enough to take care of making your hair silky smooth.  I wish manufacturers would get away from this concept that everything has to have chemicals in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I liked the product and I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
    <li> Basically the same properties and effects of regular conditioner.</li>
    <li> Used this for the first time today.  It is great. I have been trying to find something to make my hair softer because lately it feels dry.  With this product my hair immediately felt softer. When my hair dried it was not frizzy and I didn&#x27;t need to add any product to my hair. I totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> The item doesn&#x27;t seem new. Products leaked all around jar as the lid was not on tight. No protective seal inside lid.</li>
    <li> I took a shower soon I received this morocco argan, my hair looks better. I&#x27;m so happy the best purchased I ever made.</li>
    <li> i am no expert but she says it seems good quality. She only used it once so far so its too early to tell</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product. And as I rinsed it off after leaving it in for ten minutes, I was more skeptical as I didn&#x27;t like how my hair felt. Fast forward to hours later when my hair was dry.... It feels so soft and didn&#x27;t get all frizzy like it usually does! I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> This left my hair soft and manageable. I am a fan of Argan oil! This mask is not super heavy on my hair.</li>
    <li> First it is very easy to use I applied it to my dry hair and pinned it up while I got ready to shower this way it had maximum time to work. I have to say I liked the result my hair was softer and easier to handle. It also held moisture better. So that all was great. I also like that you can do this treatment daily or weekly it&#x27;s your call. I was also impressed that it did what it claimed to so and worked wonders on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product for sure.</li>
    <li> I believed I had already posted a review for this product that I was thankful for, but it was amazing, the packaging is different now.&lt;br /&gt;I have a review on my blog &amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;http://effortlesslyhunni.blogspot.com/2014/05/pure-minerals-morocco-argan-oil.html&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was gold on my hair and I wish I could work with the company because I would spread the word of this being the bees knees! lol&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a fellow curly girl then go for this..heck..any hair type! lol</li>
    <li> After years of dying my hair it has always gotten split ends or VERY dry. After using this a few times my hair has gotten back to it&#x27;s soft, silky smooth self! Love it!</li>
    <li> The daily beauty ritual I look forward to most is combing Pure Morroco Argan Oil through my hair every morning. I had heard about Moroccan Oil at my hair salon and I loved the sleek, shiny finish achieved after my stylist applied it to my hair. My hair looked and felt so healthy after the Morrocon Oil was was applied that I had to give PURE Morocco Argan Oilfollow a try and I’m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly I don’t know how I lived without PURE Morrocco Argan Oil. After the first use, I had less flyaways and my hair was more manageable and easier to style. My hair appears healthier and I have less split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got my PURE Morocco Argan Oil, I tested out how long I could go without using it and get the same results. I used it every three days and the benefits lasted just as long. I use a quarter size amount daily because I just don’t want to go without it, and the gob I use replenishes my long hair that reaches my mid-back. If you have shorter hair, you could get away with less. The jar lasted for a month and was worth every penny. I will continue to use this product daily. I don’t think I will go back to regular conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Smells nice, leaves hair feeling smooth but not the best one I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Wonderful hair treatment mask! For severely dried out hair or even just to beautify already nourished hair this stuff is great! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Natural ingredients and it works well.  It was moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
    <li> I color my hair quite often, so my hair has a lot of damage, and isn&#x27;t as beautiful as it once was. While I know there is no way to fix damaged hair aside from cutting it off, I do find that using some treatments on it helps it appear more healthy, and is also more manageable to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this in my hair routine for a long time, and my hair feels and looks a bit better. Much more softer to the touch, and it has more volume. As far as shine, it&#x27;s so-so. It&#x27;s improved from my hair before, but no mind blowing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this mask is very simple. I wash my hair as normal and rinse. I wring out my hair so it&#x27;s not dripping wet, and I take about a half dollar amount of the mask, and work it from my ends up. I have long hair, so you may adjust that amount depending on your hair length. The most important thing to remember is that a little of this goes a long way. When I first used it, I used way too much, but you live and learn. After I have worked it up to my roots, I pile my hair on top of my head and just hang out for 15 minutes while I let the mask do its thing. It isn&#x27;t drippy or anything like that, it stays put on my hair. After 15 mins, I rinse it out, and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> The product is very good. It makes my hair very soft and moisturize. However, I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> I was so excited about receiving this product, because it was one of the only Morocco Argan Oils I could find that was organic and natural, however when I opened my package half the jar was empty. :( The jar top had been not tightened, which caused almost all of the product to be disbursed throughout the packaging. I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me with this...</li>
    <li> love this product, it works great in my hair. It nourishes and moisturizes my hair. I told my sisters about this and now they want me to order them some. Love this</li>
    <li> Great product and quality! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I loved this hair treatment. I have really long hair and I had some split ends issues and was hoping this would help. I didn&#x27;t think it would because I have really dry ends with lots of breakage. This WORKED!  :) My split ends and dry ends have decreased more than 60% and that is REALLY good because my hair was fried at the end. This stuff works!!! :) I LOVE that its organic too because I only use organic products on my hair :) Thank you for making me feel sexier and more confident with my hair :)</li>
    <li> I received the oil 2 days ago and I used it today and I&#x27;m so happy with the results!!! My hair looks and feels awesome!!! I totally recommend this product..</li>
    <li> I love Argan Oil!!! This product is amazing!! It makes my hair soft and manageable.  It controls the frizzys also!!</li>
    <li> Love this for my hair. I won&#x27;t use any other kind of hair treatment now. Makes my hair super shiny and fabulous</li>
    <li> Works great. Smooths my hair and keeps it moist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog.</li>
    <li> I returned this product.  It did not work well for me.</li>
    <li> I used this for over a month and saw no difference whatsoever.</li>
    <li> maybhair is fine but coarse from always being in a bun. After just one use infelt the softness and bounciness in my hair once again. Would definitely recommend for use as deep treatment not for everyday</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural hair treatment mask to suit my hair for years. I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products, including just plain organic argan oil. Finally, I tried this one - I LOVE it. The smell is nice, it does not make my hair oily, it gives it a great all-day shine. I cannot be happier with it. I leave it in my hair for 10 minutes once a week after shampooing. The shine and softness stays with me all week.</li>
    <li> When I recieved this the seal was broken it was leaking. I did however try it. It was watery. I had to pour it on my hand and hair. No smell to it. Made my hair very knotty. I either got a bad product of this or it was replaced with something cheap. I always buy a lot of hair products and I am going to ask for my money back. Disapointed.</li>
    <li> The pictrue showed on this web is a kind of misleading. This hair treatment mask is very watery and did nothing to my hair. Besides, it was only 2/3 full when I opened it.  No leaking though.</li>
    <li> Omg!!! This jar arrived spilled all over.. The jar was so small.. Was not worth the money.. I was able to use this jar one time on my hair.. That&#x27;s how small it was.. The cream in the jar was runny .. Watery .. Had no good Oder to it.. And again it arrived spilled all over on the out side of jar!! Very disappointed. Didn&#x27;t even smell good..</li>
    <li> Loved this product, would hVe been better if I was able to leave it on, thanks snagshout!</li>
    <li> this is good item for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;silky...  hair..  always use it..  thank you for good cosmetic!!&lt;br /&gt;i love it.</li>
    <li> I accidentally bought this thinking it was just hair oil. However I noticed it was a hair mask. Oh well, I had to wash my hair anyway. It made my hair feel soft and overall I liked the product.</li>
    <li> Wow.. Amazing!  tiny and half way full its all over the jar. Yea, its all runny I read a review saying it was, thick? Well,, I don&#x27;t know about that.  I&#x27;m a guy with kinda long hair I used it 4 times maybe 5 tomorrow, gone.. yea its ok so far but is it worth it? I&#x27;m going to test for 30 days maybe? review in 15 days that&#x27;s 2 more jars $40.?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been working as a model for many years and my hair has been completely ruined by too many chemical treatments and daily straightening with hot tools - (the downside of my job). My hair was literally lifeless and as dry as a bone. I used this wonderful product twice weekly for a month and it completely restored my hair. This hair mask is completely awesome. It is better than anything else available - believe me I&#x27;ve tried everything! My hair is now silky, soft and smooth. I recommend this to all the other girls I work with at photo shoots.</li>
    <li> My hair looks and feels great! The treatment didn&#x27;t have much scent, which I liked. It&#x27;s a good sized bottle, should last a while. You can use it as often or infrequently as you like.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and as expected.</li>
    <li> Works great on dry hair</li>
    <li> I could tell that it made my hair softer.  Not as soft as I would like but I use a flat iron almost every day, so I think my hair is a little too damaged.  It was a nice product though.</li>
    <li> This oil smells good and left my hair feeling very soft!</li>
    <li> I discovered Morocco Argan Oil a while back when my mom gave it to me as a gift.  Loved how it made my hair feel, but when she told me how much it had cost for a tiny little bottle, I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to buy it for myself.  When I saw this one at amazon.com, I was hesitant to purchase it, but I am glad I did.  I love how it leaves my hair smooth, silky and manageable, definitely recommended.  It works well on my normally frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> Love it I color my hair and this makes it soft&lt;br /&gt;It seems to protect my color as well&lt;br /&gt;I have always loved hot oil treatment&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product</li>
    <li> Love the luxurious feeling the argon oil leaves in my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other products but only argon oil works with me. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> My hair feels much healthier after using this.</li>
    <li> My hair is very course,  curly and frizzy. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the product.  If my hair wasn&#x27;t so thick and course,  I think it might have worked better for me.</li>
    <li> I received a discount to try this hair treatment &amp; wow does it work!! it left my hair feeling so soft and shine and I dye my hair a lot. Worthy the buy!</li>
    <li> I just try  the morocco  Argan oil  and I love it  it make my hair feel so soft  also  most of the ingredients are natural and thats  what I really love about this product</li>
    <li> Great product.  This has been the best aragon hair conditioner iv been able to find.</li>
    <li> I was using coconut oil . After Hearing about argon oil and its benefits for hair I wanted to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Provides silky feeling to hair for few hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Long process compared to coconut oil.  Had to apply in wet hair, wait for 5 min and rinse.  Coconut oil can be applied and left on hair.&lt;br /&gt;Expensive&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t show results in short term use</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer! My hair feels really great after I use it</li>
    <li> I recently received my product and it looks like it has been spilled on the side. I opened the product to it being half empty. I would like another product this is not enough to help my hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product over three times and my hair felt no different if anything I had to add other products to make my hair more manageable.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t make my hair silky or smooth</li>
    <li> I have chemically treated hair and my hair is very dry/damaged.  I started using Organic Argan Oil Hair Treatment Mask and immediately felt a difference in my hair.  From the very first time I used it my hair was so soft.  As I continued to use the Organic Argan Oil Hair Treatment Mask, the condition of my hair started to improve.  I love how my hair feels now.  My only complaint would be that the bottle is only 4oz.  In spite of the small bottle I plan on continuing on using this product.</li>
    <li> This is a miracle treatment. I have bought this before and I am buying it again. I have colored dry hair and this makes my hair feel like satin.  Not only do I use it on my hair but I use it on my face neck and hands. Not greasy and goes on very smooth. Once a month I load it on and sleep with it in my hair. the next day it is so soft it feels invisible.</li>
    <li> I only tried it once and to me, it didn&#x27;t do anything drastic. My hair was recently bleached from salon and it is really dry, especially the tips. After following the instructions, I left it on for only 15 minutes and my hair felt the same as when I used my Aussie 3 minutes miracle deep conditioning mask. I bought this with a discounted price, so it&#x27;s worth it, but if I was to pay regular price, I personally don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really worth it. Maybe the result would be different after a couple of use or longer wait, but so far it&#x27;s just okay. It didn&#x27;t stood out for me.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair every two months as a result of this I have developed dry and frizzy hair. This oil has helped bring my hair back to being how it used to be!</li>
    <li> Firstly the smell is wonderful.  Texture is like a coconut oil.  Easy to use with great directions.  It left my hair shinier than ever, feeling cleaner, and softer.  I have only used this a few times and I can see the results. Love it!</li>
    <li> Makes hair feel silky and the ebook was good too!</li>
    <li> This argan oil hair treatment is amazing! It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which is nice. My hair is long and gets really frizzy and this hair mask smoothed it right out. I even used it in my 18 month old&#x27;s curly hair. It was tangle and frizz free!</li>
    <li> The best thing about a free sample is when you find out it&#x27;s actually a full size product! This oil hair treatment mask has a great smell, isn&#x27;t oily and leaves hair feeling amazing!</li>
    <li> This is a must have product!!!!!!  I have very long, coarse hair. I have used this mask 3 times in two weeks and my long hair is beautiful!  No more coarse hair! I love my long hair now and I love to style it now!  Trough away your pony tails and anything else...you won&#x27;t need them after you start using this mask! I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this would work when I ordered it, but I used it for the first time and I loved it! My hair felt silky just like after I go to the salon!</li>
    <li> this is amazing!!!!  It&#x27;s really made my hair come to life and not look so dry and dead!</li>
    <li> Great mask for my hair! I&#x27;ve only used it once but it made my hair feel so soft and look so shiny! Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing and makes my hair feel so smooth. I really enjoy using it!</li>
    <li> I love this!! My jair has never felt this health!! I love it!!</li>
    <li> All I can say is WOW! Morocco Argan Oil Hair Treatment Mask is wonderful! The only fragrance is just a very light coconut scent. Not artificial sickening coconut, but real coconut. It is full of natural ingredients that are alll great for your hair.  Certified organic and free of sulfates, phosphates and parabens! You will love the way it makes your hair feel and no worries that you are using things that are bad for you or the environment! I used this after shampooipng. I applied to damp hair and combed through like the directions say to do. Then I wrapped my hair in a shower cap while I was taking a bath. Afterwards I rinsed the mask out and my hair felt so silky! Lots of slip with no silicones. I even out a few drops on the ends of my hair as a leave in treatment afterwards. My curls loved it!</li>
    <li> Made my hair feeling so soft and shiny!! Would recommend to everyone!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and I notice a difference in my hair after using it for a month. I would recommend this if your hair is dry like mine and needs added moisture!</li>
    <li> i LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I have been making my own products but couldn&#x27;t get a recipe quite the way I wanted.This product takes care of that. Great job</li>
    <li> Awesome price and seems to work really great on my dry hair.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few time&#x27;s but the smell is pleasant and it really makes my hair feel great with a lot less breakage.</li>
    <li> I didnt see a real benefit for using this mask and I never received the so called Free bonus Ebook. There are better hair masks out there.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair soft and smooth. I have left it in my hair too and it gave it just enough weight to tame my curls and reduce frizz on a rainy day.</li>
    <li> No joke. ...Argan oil is amazing for hair. I love this stuff. It makes my hair soft and luxurious with non greasy moisture. It makes it easier to style too. Plus it smells good. I use it on the bottom half of my hair after a shower. Love it.</li>
    <li> Got this and tried it once so far but it&#x27;s definitely leaving my hair shinier!</li>
    <li> Made my hair really soft and healthy feeling! Glad I decided to try it out. Argan oil does wonders, especially this one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a forty-something with color treated, thick, wavy hair that requires daily conditioning. I frequently using Argan oil infused products to maintain my hair&#x27;s shine, softness and manageability. Periodically I have issues with dry hair when having been using a flat iron or similar heated hair styling equipment..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this product arrived it was packaged in bubble wrap, which was a good thing as it leaked all over itself! I&#x27;m not sure how much product was actually lost, but I would like to see the manufacturer put a seal on it to prevent this from happening to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant and very light. The texture of the product is smooth and thinner than expected.  Not sticky or &#x27;pudding like&#x27; as some others I&#x27;ve used, nor like the photo on Amazon, it&#x27;s more like runny, inexpensive conditioner.  Not creamy as much as drizzly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a generous amount as recommended on the container, working it into my newly shampooed hair and then combing it through and leaving it on for 15 minutes before rinsing with cool water. My hair was not particularly dry, but the restorative hair treatment mask did seem to soak in a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon styling I noted no loss of shine from my recently colored hair, but I also noted no enhanced shine, improvement of texture, hydration or manageability, which was a disappointment. While this product may work on fine hair, as it&#x27;s truly more of a light conditioner rather than a hydrating, restorative hair treatment mask, it did nothing for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because there are so many hair care products on the market that restore and hydrate, and do a good job on all kinds of hair,for less than the asking price of this product, I give this a 3 out of 5 star rating.  I don&#x27;t like it  as it didn&#x27;t work as expected, nor is it as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the present time I will not recommend it to others because I do not believe the product can actually full fill the promise to &#x27;naturally hydrate and repair dry and damaged hair&#x27; of all kinds. It can be used daily, weekly or monthly per the packaging, but I&#x27;m not sure if used daily you&#x27;d have enough for a full month&#x27;s trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product link indicates it can be used as an &#x27;intense&#x27; leave in conditioner.  I&#x27;ll be giving that a try too. It does come with a 30 day money back guarantee, so it may be a gamble worth taking for some who are interested in giving it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I received this product from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest review. Please be aware that I will continue to use it for a full 30 Days and update this review with a higher star rating if warranted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 4/26/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of the product before the 30 days were up, and if I had paid for the item I would be contacting the company for my money back per their guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it&#x27;s my hair? Or maybe I got a product that was faulty? (I did receive a product without a seal that appeared runny, not creamy as pictured.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I noticed no damage to my color treated hair (color remained well saturated, no stripping) I never noticed any revitalization. I did use the product to smooth fuzziness from time to time and it helped, but I had to be very careful about not putting on too much to avoid a greasy look. I never really felt a major improvement in the texture (smoothness) or sheen (shine) of my hair, and that&#x27;s what I was looking for from the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not reduce the star rating to 2 stars as I usually would, due to the factors I&#x27;ve mentioned in the update. However, I would not recommend this product.and damaged hair&#x27; of all kinds.

    <li> I have only used this twice so far and I am very impressed. I have very curly/frizzy hair and it takes a lot of work to make it look nice. After just the first use, my hair was much softer and tame. I let me hair air dry in a pony tail and my curls are defined and not poufy. I also do have crazy curly fly-aways around my face. It is nice and smooth. For the first time, I feel comfortable wearing my hair down without having to blow dry and straighten.</li>
    <li> Smells great and works great on my fine thick straight dry hair.</li>
    <li> After using this hair treatment I have noticed that it has helped the overall look of my hair. It is looking so much healthier! My ends aren&#x27;t nearly as dry as they use to be. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again. It is definitely worth trying out if you have problems with your hair!</li>

I&#x27;ll continue to try it and &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; that it helps with the dry brittle feeling as well as adding a bit of life/shine to it.</li>

    <li> I got this for my wife for her hair and she loves it. It makes her hair really soft and shiny. And for the size of the bottle for the price was right. I have seen others sell for more and not give the same results as this product. I am very happy with the purchase.</li>

    <li> really reduce the fuzzy. not so heavy, love it.</li>
    <li> I purchased for my girlfriend. She says she has used other Argan oil treatments which left her hair feeling more renewed. Basically it was not noteworthy but not terrible either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks now.  I followed the instructions exactly. Shampoo , rinse then leave the product on for 5- 15 minutes before rinsing out.  I haven&#x27;t been using any other conditioner while I have been using this product.  My hair looks good.  It flat out looks really good.  I got a haircut so that might have helped (getting rid of some of the split ends etc).  But, when I style my hair it has a lot of body, but it is manageable (which says a lot because my hair is curly), and smooth, and it&#x27;s not frizzy. So this product was a hit with me.  Really, really love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for awhile, and love it. I treat my hair often and this keeps it soft and shiny</li>
    <li> Love this treatment mask.  Leaves hair shiny and soft - while not making it lifeless and limp.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I LOVED this product! My hair is so beat up from all of the styling and treatments I do on it on a daily basis and this was amazing to help restore my hair to truly healthy.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have very thick wiry and wavy hair, plus I am gray so coloring and heat styling take a toll. I could tell a difference in my hair after the first use, it was so soft and smooth and I had less hair fall out while combing.</li>
    <li> I loved this treatment! I only use products that are natural and organic, which is why I chose this one. I washed my hair like normal and then, as the instructions say, applied the hair mask (the same amount as I use when conditioning). The second it touched my hair it went from a knotty mess to soft. So soft I could run my hands through it. I left it on for 15 minutes and rinsed. My hair was soft and I could still run my fingers through it. I plan to use this over and over. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife used this product ...&amp;#34;I was looking forward to this because my hair just recently started getting dry and frustrating because my products weren&#x27;t working. It needed a cleansing, so this was perfect! I tested it out the other day for the minimum 5 minutes and I can already tell a difference in my hair, Very happy! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Argan oil before and it helps moisturize very well. Glad I got this product and look forward to using it!</li>
    <li> So in love!!! its been about 2 months that I bleached my hair and dye it purple... It was the best style I&#x27;ve ever had BUT completely damaged my hair. I&#x27;ve hear about argan oil and decided to give it a try. Left it in for about 20min and rinsed it out. Its been 3 days and I&#x27;m in total shock how the bleached sections of my hair are not as rough as they used to be. Glad to find something that helped my hair!</li>
    <li> Had to send it back.  I received it with the cap not sealed so the contents was all over the sides of the jar and it was half full when I opened it.  So I never got to try it.  Sorry.</li>
    <li> Pretty great product.  Has helped in taming the frizzies in the humidity of FL!</li>
    <li> Does not live up to its claims and smells horrible!</li>
    <li> i LIKE IT! I HAVE A DIFFICULT TO MANAGE HAIR AND IT WORKS FOR ME!</li>
    <li> I have the worst hair.  It is dry and coarse. I have tried so many products with very little success.  I used this Morocco Argon hair mask.  I left it on my hair for 15 minutes. When I styled my hair it was so manageable,  soft and the frizz was totally  under control.  It is very easy to use.  I use the hair mask first and then finish my shower.  5-15 minutes each time and you can use it daily.  It washes out easily also.  Very good hair treatment and it came fast.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wasn&#x27;t expect much from it but was highly surprised!</li>
    <li> I love it I have been using for about two weeks now and it leaves my hair soft and manageable. I love that my hair doesn&#x27;t look so frizzy after it dries. One thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was that it seemed to me that the bottle wasn&#x27;t full. It felt to me like it was at about 60% of the bottle. other than that great product!</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because i have heard wonders about it. Also i just colored my hair with henna and its a bit dry. I am expecting this oil to make my hair soft and shiny again. On the bottle it says it can be used for the skin so i will be trying it on my face to help with the dryness. My mom used it today and her hair does not look frizzy and she liked it. I will be using it and I will come back to update my review.</li>
    <li> Its been around 2 weeks since I started using this product.Since I started using it there is noticeable shine,less frizziness and more silkiness in my hair and no tangles at all which is a huge factor for me as I got curly hair.The scent is ok but consistency is a little thin for hair mask so I have to apply a little extra amount compare to other mask, my only concern is that in the direction on how to use it says to apply it on wet hair and comb through and when I did that I experience a bit hair fall so after my first use I avoid using comb on wet hair.Overall I am happy with the product.I received it on discounted price for review purpose.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loveeeeee. Smells great, works great on my hair and whats even better is that its organic. Absolutely love how my hair feels after using this. Definitely recommending to family and friends</li>
    <li> Great size. I love how it has helped my hair get soft and looks healthy.</li>
    <li> Love Morocco Argan Oil, use it in my hair once a week to keep it soft and smooth and prevent the dry distressed look. Worked awesome, great buy!</li>
    <li> love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> Ive used this daily for about week and it definitely softens and makes my hair more shiney. The bottle is small but a little goes a long way. Smells great.</li>
    <li> Nice consistency, easy to use. I keep it in the shower and use as a mask. Leaves my hair feeling so healthy!</li>
    <li> After using this product for about a week I have noticed a difference in the health of my hair. It feels stronger more healthy. I haven&#x27;t tried many of these products But this one is probably above average. Good procure for the price. I&#x27;m going to order a couple more.</li>
    <li> I have terribly dry, frizzy and broken hair! After just one use i was able to feel AND see a difference. It smells great too, i have used products that leave my hair smelling terrible and there is nothing worse! Its a big bottle and will last a long time for me. I am excited to FINALLY getting my hair back to a healthy state.</li>
    <li> I love this. Alot of products claim to have argan oil as an ingredient  and don&#x27;t feel or smell like it but this product  certain has argan oil.  This makes your hair so soft, o just can&#x27;t stop feeling it. It also smells so good. I am African American with natural hair and this moisturizes very well. I would buy it constantly,  it WORKS</li>
    <li> After just one use my hair felt softer. Very easy to use and would  recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t wait to add this to my hair collection</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product and I love the way my hair feels after it&#x27;s left on with a shower cap for 15 minutes,  but it&#x27;s too little product for 5 stars. If you have curly-afro texture , like myself, you&#x27;ll need at least 2 of the 4 oz in the bottle each wash (it will only last 2 washes).</li>
    <li> I love this product and the free ebook. But the reason behind the 3 star rating is the bottle arrived half empty.  It didn&#x27;t spill, the bottle was just half empty</li>
    <li> I have frizzy hair due to hard water. I love feeling like my hair has an ultra shine after one treatment!</li>
    <li> Ohhhh, I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve used it a couple times now and I&#x27;m in love.  I tend to have oily hair anyway so I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be a good fit but I was wrong.  It left my strands softer and smoother than they&#x27;ve ever been.  Plus, I love the fact that you put it on in the shower and rinse afterwards.  I am not fond of leave-ins because they feel so heavy.  I think I will enjoy continuing to try this in different ways but right now, I&#x27;m more than happy with the way it&#x27;s working and I think I&#x27;ll be ordering more for friends for holidays!</li>
    <li> I received one jar of Morocco Argan Oil Hair Treatment Mask to review!  This Hair Mask made my hair look great, but it has Phenoxyethanol and Stearalkonium Chloride in it.  Here&#x27;s what NaturalNews.com had to say about Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Watch out for phenoxyethanol, a popular antibacterial and preservative chemical often referred to as natural by organic skin care brands.  Phenoxyethanol can act as an endocrine disruptor, causing damage to the bladder, brain, and nervous system in animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it&#x27;s not good for the body, so why would anybody want to use it?  I only tried it once and never again!  The jar that I received, has since been changed to a bottle, so the label is a different size.  Maybe the ingredients have changed too, but I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what The Chalkboard had to say about Stearalkonium Chloride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Stearalkonium chloride is a stearic acid-derived chemical which is primarily used as an anti-static agent, a surfactant and an antimicrobial.  Designed by the fabric industry for use as a fabric softener, this toxic chemical has somehow found its way into many hair and skin care products.  Some companies have started using it as a key conditioning ingredient in their products, as it’s a cheaper alternative to natural  ingredients that achieve the same task, like certain conditioning proteins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  HEALTH RISKS:  This chemical has been shown to cause irritation to the skin and eyes and has potential negative effects on the nervous system.  Products with this ingredient should be avoided.  That is, unless you want to wash your hair and rub your face with chemical fabric softener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that&#x27;s two toxic ingredients!  Lets take a look at the rest of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:  Organic Argan Oil, Aloe Barbadensis (Organic Aloe) Juice, Organic Castor Oil, Pro-Vitamin B5, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Cocos Nucifera (Organic Coconut RBD) Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Limmnanthes Alba (Organic Meadowfoam) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol (Derived From Coconut Oil), Stearalkonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Morocco Argan Oil Hair  Treatment Mask looks like it only has two bad ingredients and the rest are awesome ingredients.  Too bad they have those two toxic ingredients, so I can&#x27;t recommend this product, because of those two ingredients!Meadowfoam) Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol (Derived From Coconut Oil), Stearalkonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Morocco Argan Oil Hair  Treatment Mask looks like it only has two bad ingredients and the rest are awesome ingredients.

    <li> I Love how my hair looks and feels! The perfect product for my hair needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is not only beneficial to skin – it is also great for hair. This non-greasy oil makes for the perfect leave-in conditioner that makes your hair easier to style while repairing those pesky split ends! Argan oil helps to tame frizz and fly-aways, protect against the heat of hair dryers, curlers and flat irons, all the while promoting body, and a healthy shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is some research that indicates argan oil can even promote hair growth, so be sure to rub it in to your scalp too. Depending on the thickness, texture, condition, and length of your hair, you may need anywhere from 1 drop to 3 drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting the right amount may take some practice.  Start with a drop (or for short hair ½ drop may do) and warm in your palms before raking your fingers through your hair, paying special attention to your ends. Once complete, add ½ drop to your fingertips and massage into your scalp. Rub any excess into your face, neck or hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Overnight Deep Conditioning Treatment&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, brittle hair, once a week do an overnight deep conditioning treatment with argan oil. Warm 4-10 drops in your hands before massaging into your scalp. Continue applying all the way to the ends, twist, and place a shower cap on top. Your natural body heat retained in the shower cap will help the oil to penetrate, while keeping your pillowcase free of oil. In the morning, wash your hair as normal, rinsing until all residue is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dandruff or dry scalp, do an overnight treatment twice per week until dandruff is gone. Continue on with weekly treatments, or as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using Alterna for a while. I have long straight hair. This Moroccan oil is just as good. I didn&#x27;t see flyways. Overall a great product.</li>
    <li> Hi, this is a great product. I like that it&#x27;s a mask for the hair, it leaves the hair soft and easy to datangle. It comes quite thick but doesnt the hair oily or nasty. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product is the amount it has. The bottle doesn&#x27;t seemed full. I have long hair and this bottle probably only last me a few more times. Way too much to pay full price in my opinion.</li>
