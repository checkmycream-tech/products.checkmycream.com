### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy</li>
      <li>AND I&#x27;ve shopped around a bit for Saving Face and the best price was here at Amazon (I&#x27;m a Prime member).</li>
      <li>I was happy to find a product that worked and did not make me purple or ghostlike in appearance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced some sun damage to my skin and now need to be vigilant about protecting it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very effective sunscreen.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s a good travel size.</li>
      <li>I really liked it, it went on smoothly, did a really good job of moisturising and protecting, and smelled wonderful (</li>
      <li>I got two bottles in my order because I thought it would be good, and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>This one is the best so far.</li>
      <li>Most unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will order more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>This sun screen was OK.</li>
      <li>all look safe.</li>
      <li>Definitely good stuff and a very reasonable price.</li>
      <li>You do know that it is not coming off your face easily. :)</li>
      <li>Oh well, not a bad thing i guess!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fair-skinned, burn easily</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and settles into the skin in about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is a good natural face sunscreen.</li>
      <li>the best stuff and has only natural ingredients, no chemicals</li>
      <li>I come home to clean my face</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfectly pleasant and doesn&#x27;t clash with the essential oils I wear.</li>
      <li>My only gripe is that when you put it in your hands the liquid kind of appears curdled, but it rubs in great and the protection from the sun is definitely there.</li>
      <li>Make sure to mix it up before your first use; I ended up putting a bunch of  oil on my face the first squirt because the product had separated.</li>
      <li>I used it for over ten years and loved it and trusted the company for their stellar organic products.  </li>
      <li>I actually use this all over my body and my face because it&#x27;s just an amazing sunblock.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells.)</li>
      <li>It feels very gentle and is not greasy.</li>
      <li>I love the ingredients, but it makes my skin look greasy, so I can&#x27;t wear it daily.</li>
      <li>I moved onto Desert Essence Daily Essential Defence Lotion SPF15, which I got for a good price on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I use oil as a moisturizer, so i&#x27;m pretty used to that &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; but this is a bit much for me.</li>
      <li>I do a lot of walking in the southern sun and the sunblock easily lasts me the whole day, even when I am sweating.</li>
      <li>This facial Aubrey sunscreen is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>It works very well as a combination moisturiser/ sunscreen-</li>
      <li>Even though it&#x27;s only SPF 15 and contains none of the standard chemicals, it&#x27;s an extremely effective sunblock, i.e., I&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn while wearing it.  </li>
      <li>I have used Aubrey products, for years, I don&#x27;t love this as much as other products but it works well as far as I can tell.</li>
      <li>thought I&#x27;d go back to Aubrey&#x27;s since I&#x27;d loved their Blue Green SPF 15 moisturiser so much.</li>
      <li>This product manages to blend the mineral blocking agents into a formula fine enough for facial use.</li>
      <li>and I live in Florida.</li>
      <li>It is white going on but seems to absorb pretty well.</li>
      <li>Saving Face does feel a little tacky going on, but gets absorbed quickly and does not leave the skin looking white.  </li>
      <li>nice quality ingredients, but very thick.  </li>
      <li>There isn&#x27;t the greasy coating that I get with so many other sunblocks that I have tried, and it lasts a very long time.</li>
      <li>Another reviewer wrote the Natural Sun has an oatmealy scent...</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now used Aubrey&#x27;s Natural Sun SPF15 Saving Face sunscreen for well over a month.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate me.</li>
      <li>It does feel a little bit tacky when it is first applied, so that I have to leave time in between this and applying makeup.</li>
      <li>This is a little too thick and takes more work to apply than I was expecting.  </li>

<li> I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate me.</li>
<li> It does feel a little bit tacky when it is first applied, so that I have to leave time in between this and applying makeup.</li>
<li> This is a little too thick and takes more work to apply than I was expecting.  </li>
<li> My skin is a bit oily and this lotion left it dry.</li>
<li> and so is my husband who uses the cream when the air is very dry here with the central heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I find if I wait too long</li>
<li> It worked for shielding the suns rays, however it had a strange play dough smell to it that lingered on my face all day.</li>
<li> However, you need to ensure you apply it soon after drying off after showering or washing your face, while your skin is still moistish and before it has dried completely.</li>
<li> I also have dry skin, which makes applying some face creams with natural sunscreen difficult because the cream adheres too much, and I&#x27;m left looking like Coco</li>
<li> and my face is too dry</li>
<li> If your skin is dry this is probably not for you.</li>
<li> It was slightly tacky but did not leave a white residue.</li>
<li> used to use Aubrey&#x27;s Organics Blue Green Algae SPF 15 moisturiser.</li>
<li> I like this product because it is all-natural and doesn&#x27;t contain oxybenzone or other harmful chemicals.</li>
<li> But then they removed the PABA and I was forced to look elsewhere for a combination moisturiser/ daily sunscreen.&lt;br</li>
<li> It became very thick and left my face glowing white and with a very thick zinc residue even to the next morning.</li>
<li> I cycled the other day without my usual sun shirt on at midday for an hour, and my neck and shoulders-</li>
<li> I would give it a five except it is a little tacky feeling.  </li>
<li> a little easier to apply.</li>
<li> It smells a little along the lines of oatmeal, but once you put it on, you don&#x27;t smell it.</li>
<li> My forearams, however, which were unprotected (because I thought they were tough and leathery enough from all my outdoors work not to need protecting) did.&lt;br</li>
<li> Like that it lasts through heavy sweating.</li>
<li> It is the clearest I have tried, but still made me slightly pale.  </li>
<li> Nothing like the clown makeup effect of the Avalon Organics cream I tried a year ago, but a faint white sheen nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> can be hard to apply.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen mineral sunscreens.</li>
<li> , it goes on tackier and leaves a very faint whiteness.</li>
<li> this product stinks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I like this product because it is all-natural and doesn&#x27;t contain oxybenzone or other harmful chemicals. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clog pores. It does feel a little bit tacky when it is first applied, so that I have to leave time in between this and applying makeup. Otherwise, it is a good natural face sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is a little too thick and takes more work to apply than I was expecting.  I wanted something a little easier to apply.</li>
    <li> Like that it lasts through heavy sweating.</li>
    <li> This sun screen was OK. I stopped using it and bought Kiss My Face which I prefer. It worked for shielding the suns rays, however it had a strange play dough smell to it that lingered on my face all day. It was slightly tacky but did not leave a white residue. If your skin is dry this is probably not for you. My skin is a bit oily and this lotion left it dry.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for about a year and swear by it.  I&#x27;ve experienced some sun damage to my skin and now need to be vigilant about protecting it.  Saving Face does feel a little tacky going on, but gets absorbed quickly and does not leave the skin looking white.  I do have to rinse off my hands after applying.  Even though it&#x27;s only SPF 15 and contains none of the standard chemicals, it&#x27;s an extremely effective sunblock, i.e., I&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn while wearing it.  As with all Aubrey products, shake it as well as you can before applying.  AND I&#x27;ve shopped around a bit for Saving Face and the best price was here at Amazon (I&#x27;m a Prime member).</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients, but it makes my skin look greasy, so I can&#x27;t wear it daily.</li>
    <li> this product stinks! It&#x27;s like water mixed with petroleum! I would not recommend it</li>
    <li> the best stuff and has only natural ingredients, no chemicals</li>
    <li> nice quality ingredients, but very thick.  can be hard to apply.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I don&#x27;t use it often because it leaves my face feeling extra sticky. I use oil as a moisturizer, so i&#x27;m pretty used to that &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; but this is a bit much for me.</li>
    <li> I actually use this all over my body and my face because it&#x27;s just an amazing sunblock. There isn&#x27;t the greasy coating that I get with so many other sunblocks that I have tried, and it lasts a very long time. I do a lot of walking in the southern sun and the sunblock easily lasts me the whole day, even when I am sweating. I come home to clean my face and I still see bits of product on my wash rag.</li>
    <li> This facial Aubrey sunscreen is fantastic.  Leaves your face feeling refreshed and protects from the sun.  Excellent!</li>
    <li> I like this face sunscreen. It feels very gentle and is not greasy. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate me. It smells a little along the lines of oatmeal, but once you put it on, you don&#x27;t smell it. My only gripe is that when you put it in your hands the liquid kind of appears curdled, but it rubs in great and the protection from the sun is definitely there. I would definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> I cannot use any fragranced products, not even with essential oils. I cannot tolerate any chemical off-gassing. This product manages to blend the mineral blocking agents into a formula fine enough for facial use. I use it underneath my make up. It goes on smoothly and settles into the skin in about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> It covers well and seems to protect my skin. my only dislike would be that my skin still feels like I have it on after I have used face cleanser to remove it. It takes several cleansings to remove it. Oh well, not a bad thing i guess! You do know that it is not coming off your face easily. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m fair-skinned, burn easily and I live in Florida. I also have dry skin, which makes applying some face creams with natural sunscreen difficult because the cream adheres too much, and I&#x27;m left looking like Coco the Clown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Aubrey&#x27;s Organics Blue Green Algae SPF 15 moisturiser. I used it for over ten years and loved it and trusted the company for their stellar organic products.  But then they removed the PABA and I was forced to look elsewhere for a combination moisturiser/ daily sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I tried Avalon Organics Vitamin C Renewal SPF 15, but then they changed t uhe formulation (I believe it was to get their organic-esque certification.) It became very thick and left my face glowing white and with a very thick zinc residue even to the next morning. Most unpleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I moved onto Desert Essence Daily Essential Defence Lotion SPF15, which I got for a good price on Amazon. I really liked it, it went on smoothly, did a really good job of moisturising and protecting, and smelled wonderful (and I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong smells.) Then its price went up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I&#x27;d go back to Aubrey&#x27;s since I&#x27;d loved their Blue Green SPF 15 moisturiser so much. I found their Saving Face range. I wondered if it would work as a moisturiser as well as a sunscreen (since it&#x27;s not labelled as a moisturiser on the bottle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now used Aubrey&#x27;s Natural Sun SPF15 Saving Face sunscreen for well over a month. It works very well as a combination moisturiser/ sunscreen- i.e. there&#x27; s no need in my opinion to apply a separate moisturiser underneath. However, you need to ensure you apply it soon after drying off after showering or washing your face, while your skin is still moistish and before it has dried completely. I find if I wait too long and my face is too dry, it goes on tackier and leaves a very faint whiteness. Nothing like the clown makeup effect of the Avalon Organics cream I tried a year ago, but a faint white sheen nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I&#x27;m very happy and so is my husband who uses the cream when the air is very dry here with the central heating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very effective sunscreen. I cycled the other day without my usual sun shirt on at midday for an hour, and my neck and shoulders- the parts where I&#x27;d purposefully put the Aubrey&#x27;s- did not burn. My forearams, however, which were unprotected (because I thought they were tough and leathery enough from all my outdoors work not to need protecting) did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Another reviewer wrote the Natural Sun has an oatmealy scent... yes, sort of... just smells neutral. It&#x27;s perfectly pleasant and doesn&#x27;t clash with the essential oils I wear. I got two bottles in my order because I thought it would be good, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I will order more. Definitely good stuff and a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have used Aubrey products, for years, I don&#x27;t love this as much as other products but it works well as far as I can tell. Make sure to mix it up before your first use; I ended up putting a bunch of  oil on my face the first squirt because the product had separated. Of course that is one thing I like about Aubrey is that they dont&#x27; add chemicals just for the sake of holding things in suspension. It is white going on but seems to absorb pretty well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen mineral sunscreens. This one is the best so far. It works, it doesn&#x27;t leave a white mask and the ingredients all look safe. Also it&#x27;s a good travel size. I&#x27;m using my 4th bottle now...and still like it.</li>
    <li> This protected well.  It is the clearest I have tried, but still made me slightly pale.  I would give it a five except it is a little tacky feeling.  I was happy to find a product that worked and did not make me purple or ghostlike in appearance.</li>
