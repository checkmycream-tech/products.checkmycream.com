<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When I first purchased the item, I was hesitant that it would do anything for my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now (I use it at night because it can make my face feel a little sticky sometimes) and it has made a huge difference. My skin feels softer, more radiant, smoother, and my pores are much smaller than before. Great price and the small bottle lasts for quite awhile since you only need about 3-4 drops.</li>
    <li> I see a great difference in my face. Smoother and less noticeable scars.</li>
    <li> This lovely and light serum has tightened my skin and reduced my pores. Although it seems a bit on the &amp;#34;watery&amp;#34; side, it dries to a nice enough finish that you could skip the foundation if you want to. I&#x27;m feeling &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; on the stuff!</li>
    <li> I was looking for an economical way to get a &amp;#34;face lift.&amp;#34;  This vitamin C serum was my fix.  I have used the serum for about two weeks now, and I am pleased that the darkness around my eyes has diminished.  I know this sounds hard to believe, but I have received compliments on my eyes since I have been using this serum.  I guess they just look brighter and sunnier!  This serum is a natural product, I see results, and it is affordable.  I love it; maybe it is sunshine in a bottle.</li>
    <li> I mixed a few drops with Organic Coconut Oil to remove makeup and cleanse my face. My skin is happy.</li>
    <li> This Facial Serum has changed my life! I had terrible acne and acne scars and started to get some fine lines around my under eyes Since i Started using this all my blemishes are gone! and the scars have started to fade!...the lines are less noticeable as well! Plus its an all natural product! I dont have to worry about what chemicals are on my face, THANK YOU SO MUCH MAPLE HOLISTICS YOU&#x27;VE CHANGED MY LIFE</li>
    <li> Such a wonderful product. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and my hyperpigmentation from past acne is looking at least 20% lighter. I don&#x27;t pass out good reviews lightly, but this is an awesome product. This is isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky when applied to the skin, but instead goes on very smoothly and is nice and hydrating. I will continue to use this as this is now a holy grail product for me! Thanks for such a great product Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband and he really loves using it. It is super simple to use you don&#x27;t need much as it goes a long way. He has already been able to see a difference in how his skin feels and looks. It has really been helping with the wrinkles that he has.</li>
    <li> I love the Natural Facial Serum. Some things that I loved about the product is that it is made with Natural ingredients. The scent of Maple is just right. It doesn&#x27;t make you smell like syrup. When applying it goes on nice to where you don&#x27;t have an oily or greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum leaves your face feeling refreshed and rejuvenated. My skin has gone from having very noticeable wrinkles to very few. Went from having super oily skin to not overly dry. But perfect in my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the serum daily before applying a daily moisturizer and have had no issues with either sticking or one being counteracted. I have not had any negative reactions. I am hesitant on using new products with fear I will have a horrible reaction as my skin is sensitive. However, this serum is well made and holds up. Using this serum has helped make my face and skin look so much healthier has well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a product to help with wrinkles or sun damage or any negative affecting condition that you may have experienced this natural serum will help with improving flaws.</li>
    <li> I am getting towards the age where I HAVE to start to use something for my face that will help with the fine lines and  to make my skin plump again.  I recevied a sample of this product from a free sample site and have used it for short time and am pleased to say it exceeds my expectations.  First of all this serum soaks into your skin, it doesnt leave it feeling oily or greasy.  I even put my facial mosturiser ontop of it - and have no issues.  I am begin proactive on the war with the fine lines and the appearence of wrinkles on my face, because begin in my 40&#x27;s, it comes quickly.  On top of all this, it is made in the USA and doesnt break my bank.  This product will be with me for the long haul.</li>
    <li> I could really see a difference in my skin. It looked brighter, tighter and smoother. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the way it felt on my skin-it&#x27;s a little sticky-that&#x27;s the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars. But, once it dries, the stickiness goes away &amp; I would put moisturizer over it. I don&#x27;t get breakouts often, and when I do, it&#x27;s only one small one. Plus, my skin is usually a little sensitive, but this serum didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and it didn&#x27;t turn my skin red like some vitamin C serums do. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This serum is wonderful! I have been using it twice a day and have definitely noticed the spots getting lighter and the fine lines are starting to soften. I am blown away by how much better my skin looks and how the sun spots, acne spots, and age spots are completely disappearing.  I did not get this free so my opinion is my own based on my actual purchase.  I have purchased a lot of Vitamin C Serum from lots of other companies and have found them to all be way more expensive with little to no results. I felt no burning at all as others have stated, it goes on smooth, and does not leave a sticky or gross residue like the others that I have tried. This product is not to clear up acne or to moisturize your face, it is a serum that goes under your daily moisturizer to help with specific targeted concerns like sun damage, age spots, old acne scar spots, and fine lines. I have very sensitive skin and have no issue with sensitivity with this product.  I love it and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I really recommend this serum to those looking to improve their skin. I got the serum for my husband, he use to work in the sun all the time, never applied sun screen and he also smoked. This serum has lighten his skin and I have noticed the wrinkles in his face decrease. I wanted that same change so I started to use this serum myself. It goes on smooth and does not leave a oily residue. I am now noticing my skin glowing as well. I have now dropped my other face serums and switching to this! For those needing that glow, reduce wrinkles or just start the prevention I recommend this! Easy to apply and feels great on my skin.</li>
    <li> This literally feels like liquid silk on my skin.. i didnt have to wait to see the results, it feels amazing the first time i put it one. it soaked right in and made my skin soo soft.&lt;br /&gt;Makes me feel great to know that it is all natural, I hate using chemicals on my skin. It also works wonders on the bags under my eyes when I am tired. :)</li>
    <li> I read about vitamin C and the ingredients in this as some sort of miracle product (not from this manufacturer, just in general), and I&#x27;ve used Maple Holistics in the past happily, so when I ordered my other products I threw this in.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any miracles in few days I&#x27;ve used it, but I will say it is light weight, not at all oily or unpleasant, and I like that all the ingredients are natural.  If I suddenly start looking 30 again, I&#x27;ll let everyone know, but for now, it is a pretty easy addition to my facial routines.  I will add that Maple Holistics has a knock out customer service department -- they always email me personally and ask how I&#x27;m doing, and like everything with Amazon, this ships very quickly in and in good shape.  Gee, what did we do to find great stuff before the internet?!</li>
    <li> All the five star reviews on this product are correct. Works great.  They do not talk about texture. This is not oily or geasey or sticky at all. Not thick. Almost water consistency.  Dries on your skin instant. Skin will feel tight for 30 seconds.Does not have any strong smell. Been using only 2 weeks and seeing the result on fine lines and skin tones. Will recommend to all my friends. Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;good!!</li>
    <li> I was just on the Maple Holistics website, trying to find the ingredients lists for some of their products (before buying), and I noticed that they have a page on their website telling people that they can have one free product of theirs if they leave a review here on Amazon. If you go to their website and click on &amp;#34;free products,&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll see for yourself. This makes me wonder if all these positive reviews of their products here on Amazon are actually authentic.</li>
    <li> I looked up all the ingredients of the Maple Holistics serum before I purchased it, and I was pleasantly surprised.This serum is a powerhouse! Not only is the combination of antioxidants &amp; other beneficial ingredients great for your skin, there aren&#x27;t any irritants or unnecessary additives like fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a water-like consistency, not oily. It takes just a few drops for my entire face and neck. I use it before applying my moisturizer [night] and sunscreen [day].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference in my skin after the first few days. I have sensitive skin with mild rosacea, and the redness in my cheeks has diminished noticeably. My skin is firmer and smoother. I never understood the claims of &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; skin, but I do now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve just received my second bottle; the first lasted over 3 months. Maple Holistics Vitamin C Serum has a permanent place in my skin-care routine.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It is my go to beauty product for my face it makes it look so much much brighter and I can tell it is a little bit firmer. Love all the natural ingredients used.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a general firming/rejuvenating product, and this one seemed economical, so I took a chance. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months now, so I can&#x27;t claim any miracles, though the overall tone and texture of my skin has improved slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More surprisingly, and pleasantly, within a few days it reduced/eliminated the oiliness of my skin and shrank my pores considerably. I have used many similar, more costly products for these issues from Eminence and didn&#x27;t get nearly such good results, so that was a great bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is now my one and only go-to serum. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
    <li> Maple Holistics continues to impress me. The Purest Vitamin C Natural Facial Serum has helped my dry skin. I have used other brands in the past that dry my skin. Maple Holistics has helped clear up my face which had some dry and red spots. This is the 2nd time I have ordered their Vitamin C serum. It was delivered as ordered.  I have used it for a little over a month.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of face products. I like to take care of my skin. This product smells good and seems to be potent. While I don&#x27;t have it under a microscope it definitely doesn&#x27;t seem diluted. Company seems reputable in their promise. I feel the firmness it provides when it dries. I have been using Vitamin C serums for a long time and I know a good product when i see it. It drys quickly. I use it AM and PM and after apply moisturizer or moisturizing sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t effect my makeup and gives me the feel I&#x27;m looking for. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this project for almost a year and love how my skin feels and looks. My skin feels healthier, looks healthier and this product has helped even out some unevenness in my skin tone.</li>
    <li> The bottle was packaged securely in a bubble wrap bag, and the neck of the bottle sealed with a plastic collar. Included were 2 cards: one with information about the product and instructions for use, and the other a promotional card with information about the company&#x27;s &amp;#34;holistic promise&amp;#34; of 100% quality guarantee. There is a dropper that screws into the bottle that makes it easy to dispense the product. The serum is light, without any discernible scent, and goes on smooth. It absorbs quickly into the skin without leaving any oily residue and within a few minutes I could feel a slight tightening of my skin. I only needed about 7 drops to cover my entire face. I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know how well it works and whether or not it lives up to its claims, but so far I like it. I received this product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> I like how it leaves my skin it leaves soft and smooth</li>
    <li> Made my face feel soft immediately after using.  My face is normally very dry after washing even after applying moisturizer.  I put a few drops of this on my face and it soaks right in making my face feel very nice.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and am allergic to a lot of stuff.  I was so thankful to find this Vitamin C serum!  It didn&#x27;t contain any ingredients that I was allergic to.  Being a middle-aged woman, I was looking for something to help refresh my worn out skin.  Might have to try some of their other products too.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, it has taken my mild acne scars and diminshed them almost completatly you will not be disapointed in this product.</li>
    <li> makes my skin feel smooth.  Don&#x27;t wear it out in the sun.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful!!! I have used other products similar to this one, but will be ordering this again!!!!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have always had dry, reactive/sensitive skin which limits my options for facial creams/serums.  This serum has been a game changer for me!  The first couple of days I could feel it tighten my skin up just a bit but certainly no burning/stinging like I usually get with most other products when I first start using them.  After the intro period, it goes on smoothly and my skin feels ridiculously soft and has a really nice glow to it!  I actually find myself looking forward to being able to put it on. Definitely need to apply a mosturizer afterwards if you have dry skin. Very reasonably priced. So happy I found this!</li>
    <li> This works so well and so gently.</li>
    <li> I just received this product and have only used it a few times, but I love it!! I use it both day and night. The serum is not sticky when it dries. My skin feels moist and plump. It does not make my face break out. All around I love it!!</li>
    <li> This serum was shipped quickly and came wrapped in bubble wrap and fully sealed.  It has a pleasant smell and a nice consistency - it&#x27;s not too watery, but goes on the skin smoothly.  I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times now, but I do like the feel of it on my skin.  I will update if I notice (or don&#x27;t notice) any improvements in my skin.  I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a couple of weeks, I haven&#x27;t cared for this product.  I stopped using it on my face and am now using it on my declate and neck, because I didn&#x27;t like the way it felt on my face.  It&#x27;s kind of sticky.  After I apply it, I feel the need to wash my hands, which doesn&#x27;t happen when I use other serums.</li>
    <li> broke my skin out.. sorry..</li>
    <li> I love this! It is an excellent product for my sensitive skin. This product is very soothing and non greasy. It can be slightly sticky if you apply too much. This is my go to product from now on!!!</li>
    <li> I was curious to see what vitamin C would do to help my complexion.  I was pleasantly surprised to see smoother skin and more even skin color.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all and absorbs very quickly.  I will definitely buy this again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Feels much nicer on my skin than other vitamin c serums! :) and it doesn&#x27;t have a strange smell like most do. It looks almost exactly the same though. Just clearer, but maybe that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s supposed to be more &amp;#34;pure&amp;#34; than others. It still leaves a slightly sticky feeling on your skin,but not as bad as others. And it doesn&#x27;t burn! :)</li>
    <li> i usually make my own vitamin C serum myself since they tend to be $xx per ounce, but when i was offered to get this item at a reduced priceas long as i left an unbiased review, i ordered it last week. actually checking on amazons listings of vitamin C serums, this is the best priced one of the dozens i&#x27;ve seen there. this particular one has most of the additives i use in my own homemade serum, and they even add 3 things more like algae. the consistency is a good balance, it is not too runny that it goes down your hand/arm as you apply it, and it is not too thick since you want vitamin C to absorb as best possible, and thicker serums will just sit on the skin, which is fine if you want a hyaluronic &#x27;top coat&#x27;, but this you want to sink in. afterwards it doesnt leave a sheen or stickiness either, so overall it seems well thought out for ingredients and viscosity. for the price is it now ($12) i would definitely say try to compare against your own pricier serums you&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Not oily and gives skin a nice appearance.</li>
    <li> I am a 34 year AA woman with a fair amount of acne scarring. I liked this product. I wasn&#x27;t sure of what to expect because I have never use a facial serum. After only two weeks I saw noticeable skin brightening and after one month, I noticed some fading in my acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sure, the serum is light and not very heavy. Which is good for me because I use a heavier skin moisture (Origins Plantscription Firming Lift) After application, there was some tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was satisfied. My complexion gets a bit dull in the colder months so this is a nice addition to the regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash with gentle cleanser with cool water&lt;br /&gt;2. Every other day gentle daily facial scrub&lt;br /&gt;3. Toner (in the evening)&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply serum (just enough...)&lt;br /&gt;5. Wait about 10- 15 min - apply face creame&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if you wear makeup, I think it&#x27;s best to wait about 20-30 min to let everything absorb into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I mix this with Jojoba oil and it works wonders! The bags under my eyes have gotten lighter and I&#x27;ve noticed a reduction in acne. I have very sensitive skin and this does not bother me one bit. I would suggest putting 4 drops on your hand and rub it into your skin then applying your favorite face cream.</li>
    <li> Love this! My skin felt revitalized, and toned after using this. It does seem to leave a little residue once dried, but I just dampen my fingers and smooth my fingers over my face and it soaks in. Happy overall with this product!</li>
    <li> easily applied, really feels good on my face</li>
    <li> My skin is loving this stuff!  Soaks in quickly, no strong odor, and I feel like it is soothing.  I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks so far, but I am already starting to see improvements in texture, quicker cell renewal and some reduction in oil.</li>
    <li> This serum is great for acne, eczema, and dry scalp. After a few days of using it, I noticed my acne scars going away. It Also helped clear the eczema that I had been battling with for a while. I also rub some of this through my scalp and I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my scalp and reduction in dandruff. Overall this is a great product.</li>

I have a really visible difference !</li>
    <li> use it on hands before bed have noticed difference in softness and spots reduction.</li>
    <li> I love using Vitamin C serums when I&#x27;m done dermarolling to get the full results. They both help with collagen production and regenerating new skin cells. I have acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t make my face feel sticky. I have seen my acne scars fading quickly. The packing of this product is good because it has an amber bottle which protects the Vitamin C from going bad. Another great thing about this product is that its natural which means you&#x27;re not putting any harsh chemicals on your face.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous product! I am 46 years old and my daughter is 17 years old. We both have seen visible results from using this serum.  In just the first few days of use, we both liked the feeling and the smell (a very light, clean, slight maple scent) of the serum. It absorbs quickly into your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or sticky feeling. After a couple weeks though, we could tell that the serum was making a difference as my skin tone has improved and is much more smooth, firm and youthful looking. My fine lines are visibly less. My teen daughter&#x27;s oily acne prone skin is much clearer and smoother as well. We both use this day and night on clean skin. I am very pleasantly surprised with how great the results are of this product that it not only helps older, aging, dry skin, but also for younger, oily, acne prone skin! Will be buying more, so that we don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I have been using this serum for two weeks now and I really love it! I live in a dry polluted climate in Los Angeles and was noticing my skin was feeling very dry and sad. I feel my skin is very soft and more hydrated and because of it my skin is happier. I have sensitive skin and break out from time to time and have noticed no irritation or break outs from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this serum again! It is light weight and goes on smooth. I apply my moisturizer over it for extra hydration but feel this serum could be used alone as well.</li>
    <li> Loved it on my skin made it feel amazing. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin smooth and soft. Definitely will purchase this again!</li>
    <li> Great product! I ordered this product because it has quite a few ingredients that when they all are used together are supposed to bring amazing results to facial and neck skin.  I have been using it for almost a month, and can already tell quite a difference to my sun damaged 55 year old face.  I will order again.  Thank you :-0</li>
    <li> my wife always tries her products on me. and this one works. i don&#x27;t like all this fluffy stuff but this one ill let her keep using on me</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I use it in the evening.  I use it even before applying makeup in the morning.  See a major difference in my skin.  Thank you very much for an easy to use product that is beneficial to my skin especially my face.</li>
    <li> This facial serum goes on light, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and helped reduce the appearance of redness and pores on my face in a matter of days. I am so glad I purchased this and recommend it to anyone who has sensitive and difficult skin!</li>
    <li> I chose 3 stars because It is definately not for my skin I guess I&#x27;m not old enough yet to be wearing this YIKES! I&#x27;m only 24! The reason why i got it its because i have acne problem so i wash my face with silicydic acid which has helped me a lot but it does dry up my face so i go through bottles of facial oils. I got this Vitamin C serum thinking it would have an oily consistency and calm my skin down while its nurishing it well turns out it burns when i apply it for about 20 minutes later on it just feels like my skin is streched out not a good feeling so i only use it about once every 2 weeks. One thing I do like is that it makes my skin look brighter in the mornings</li>
    <li> Facial Serum containing Vitamin C is considered a staple in my home because Vitamin C is important for cellular repair, fights infection and boosts immunity.  Vitamin E enhances tissue repair and healing. If your skin is prone to breakouts, like my son, this is 2 things to consider in an effective skincare regimen. Hyaluronic acid isn’t harsh or skin-stripping in fact  babies are born with a high level of hyaluronic acid, which keeps their skin plump and smooth. As we age we can never regain that soft baby skin but we can protect ours and provide what is needed to reduce our signs of aging.When I look for a skincare it is always best to know what my skin needs as it ages and this Natural Facial Serum has everything I need and more. My husband uses it as well. As with all products results may vary but all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
    <li> I am a girl who suffers with mild to moderate acne and scarring. I&#x27;ve always been terrified of serums because they seem so pore clogging. This was greatly surprising. It has a thin consistency and no bothersome fragrances. It sinks in and works to heal my skin without clogging my pores! How could I complain? It is simply fantastic. Not to mention it is natural, which is a wonderful plus. Thanks Maple Holistics!</li>
    <li> I love this product! Makes my skin look great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this serum.  i was using another brand before maple holistics and it was sticky and dried my face.  this serum smells wonderful and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Not sure what this is supposed to do but seems to make my skin feel firmer, esp around the eyes.  Cool when applied.</li>
    <li> i have really sensitive skin and this product did not make me break out in rashes. i love how this product smoothes out my skin and lightens my scars. i recently found out that you must dab serums onto your skin instead of pat (this allows the product to sink into the skin better and you will see results much faster). i recently bought some more bottles to stock up!</li>
    <li> If I would have know the results this would have!  I have skin tags on my face and neck.  I developed a very large one, probably about the size of the tip of your pinky, on the side of my face.  I was sure I would have to go have it burned off.  Within a couple of days I noticed a change in the large one, it was shrinking and drying up.  I started applying this serum to the ones on my neck and chest last week, they show marked decrease in size!  Also, I has some around my eyes, they are nearly gone.  This product is worth it.  The confidence I have about my face is amazing, and I feel as though the signs of aging have been greatly reduced as well.</li>
    <li> Recently I visited my daughter after not seeing her for several weeks. I remarked that her skin looked clearer and smoother than I&#x27;d seen in a long time.  She showed me the Natural Serum bottle and said she was real happy with the results. Now I&#x27;m thinking of trying it for help with cell turnover. Thanks for making this serum!</li>
    <li> Love love love this serum! I have horrible skin... It&#x27;s very oily and acne prone. Within a week if using this my skin has become clear and vibrant. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> something seems gritty at the bottom of the bottle? Not sure what it is, but sometimes if I pull from the bottom of the bottle I get a gritty texture.  Overall, it&#x27;s ok.  Not the best Vitamin C I&#x27;ve purchased.  I love applying it in the morning, it makes my skin look fresh and subtle during the day.</li>
    <li> This serum is fantastic! I bought it because I wanted something to moisturize my skin and almost all of the commercial lotions make my break out. This stuff moisturized my skin (even in the cold, dry climate I live in), evened my skin tone, basically got rid of any pimples. Every morning my skin looks better and better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approximately three weeks and have seen no improvement in my face</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.With all the talk about vitamin c being good for your skin I had to give this product a try.I must say I am liking the product so far.goes on easy ,and a little goes a long way,it feels lightweight and smooth on my skin,and  my face feels much softer to the touch  since using. Havent noticed much change in the dark spots on my face BUT the fine lines are looking much finer,and my skin is looking softer and brighter</li>
    <li> Most serums leave a coating on the surface of your skin. I knew I had a winner when after applying the serum immediately got absorbed.</li>
    <li> The most watery and thin serum I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have used other C serums such as Mario Bedescu and the bottle lasts forever because one-two drops are thick and spread all over your face- with this product, you need a very large portion in order to cover your face because it is so thin and watery.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem like it does anything.  It also is misleading by saying &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;- there is no information on the product that tells how is was sustainably made, organic, fair trade etc (but I am not marking it down of this, just noting for those who care)...  I give it a 2: I didn&#x27;t throw it away, it&#x27;s not burning my face, or making break out... It just feels like a placebo</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. It hydrates my dry skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth, soft and supple. No greasy feeling, it absorbs quickly and just leaves satiny feeling skin behind. I use it on my face, neck and hands. My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this soft since my 20&#x27;s. It&#x27;s also helping with some dark spots that have begun to bother me, but I&#x27;d use it for how incredible my skin looks and feels anyway! Nothing I&#x27;ve tried previously has come close to these results.</li>
    <li> Absorbs quickly and has evened out my skin tone in a week&#x27;s use. As always, affordable and effective. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Maple Holistics it seems.</li>
    <li> Great for acne prone skin!  Evens skin tone!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Use it day and night for the last 5 days. I can see a difference already!</li>
    <li> This serum wasn&#x27;t what I expected it&#x27;s really small and honestly smells terrible. It kind of cleansed and smooth ended my face a little for a while but it didn&#x27;t really work any wonders. I guess this product is not for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two weeks, and it has completely revitalized my skin. Before when I would see my reflection out in the sunshine without make up, I was embarrassed at how blotchy, tired and grey my skin looked. Now my skin has an even tone, and it GLOWS! I thought nothing would be able to save my skin, scince I&#x27;m a smoker, I just thought it would be this way until I&#x27;m able to quit. I&#x27;m not there yet (and definitely NOT endorsing smoking) I&#x27;m just trying to illustrate how awesome this serum works. My face is tight and dewy, and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s only $13! It has also de-puffed my face and I swear I look at least five years younger. Best investment you can make.</li>
    <li> I love my face! My skin feels so soft and looks luminous!! Even friends and coworkers have commented about my radiant glow! I use it morning and night under my day and night moisturizer. I love this product, I highly recommend this!! 😊</li>
    <li> I have found this product to be similar in consistency, appearance and color to another Vitamin C serum I have used for approximately 12 months.  The other product lists Vitamin C as first ingredient (10%).  Maple Holistics does not show percentage of Vitamin C in their product. If the product contains 10%, I would rate 5 stars as it offers same ingredients at a lower price. Lack of listing complete ingredient information is reason for 4 star rating.  Disclaimer - I received this product at reduced cost in exchange for a fair and honest review.</li>
    <li> After using this product for just a few days my skin feels amazing and looks much healthier.  This is a great product that utilizes a synergistic combination of skin enhancing ingredients that are known to be beneficial in combating sun damaged and aging skin. I recommend this product and look forward to continuing to use it myself!</li>
    <li> *UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;I was told to write a review for a free bottle of this amazing Vitamin C!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product now for a very long time. It really really helps with lines, wrinkles and dark spots on your face. Since using this product, no new wrinkles, yaaay!! That&#x27;s a great plus! I don&#x27;t need anymore. I will not use any other Vitamin C. This is the absolute Number One on the market today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best serum ever! I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks and I can already see a slight difference in a part of my face. I have the # 11 lines in between in eyebrows and it was red. Now the red is gone and the lines are softened. Buy it!  You won&#x27;t be sorry! I use this 2 times a day.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after LOVING Maple Holistics&#x27; shampoo. I have very oily, acne prone skin. I use this serum morning and night and have found consistency is the key with this stuff. I have noticeable brighter, clearer, and smoother skin. Although my acne and blackheads haven&#x27;t magically vanished, they are much more manageable and less stubborn.</li>
    <li> Great!!! It leaves your face soft and hydrated.</li>
    <li> My skin is sensitive and usually breaks out whenever I try products like these. A friend game me some as a gift and expected the usual results. To my surprise it helped my skin to stay acne free and it makes it look very healthy. Thank you</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this! My skin has improved so much since I got this! It&#x27;s my beauty secret</li>
    <li> You will love this product!  It really does smooth out wrinkles! It clears up acne as well!  I have an adult case of acne and my blemishes have disappeared!  My husband uses this when he has a red spot coming on and he loves it.  I no longer use the acne medicine from the stores.  I just buy this!  It smooths your skin so your wrinkles disappear, fights aging and acne!  My 20 year old daughter is in love with this and will not use anything else!  She wants to get a jump on younger looking skin now!  She doesnt get acne anymore because she uses this everyday.  She uses the serum like it is suggested to use and she has great skin!  Her mom is right behind with younger looking skin!  You dont need any other product for your face!  This is the all in one serum that you will ever need! I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m Loving how my skin looks &amp; feel! I can really see a difference in my skin. It looks brighter, tighter and smoother. Also It makes my skin very radiant, and well hydrated. I also love how it helps to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. I put a litlle moisturizer over it &amp; I don&#x27;t get breakouts often now after using it like I got before!. My skin generally is a little sensitive but this serum didn&#x27;t irritate my skin and didn&#x27;t turn my skin red like some vitamin C serums have done in the past. So I will be definitely buying this again. Worked Great for me so I would recommend it!</li>
    <li> I got this because I get really dry around my nose area during the winter.  A friend of mine told me to try this out and I am glad I did.  This applies to your face great.  Not oily or leave a stickiness to your face.  I even have my husband using it because he is in the weather working all the time.  I love the Guarantee 100% Holistic Promise, you can feel secure in your purchase knowing that if for any reason at all you are not satisfied with the results of using the product, you can get a full refund - hassle free, no questions asked.</li>
    <li> I started using this about 10 days ago and was going to wait to write a review for when i noticed a difference but for the last few days I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from coworkers about how nice and bright my skin looked. Now I should tell you that considering I work a 8pm to 6am shift and on average only get about 5 hours of interrupted sleep, that&#x27;s a big compliment to me! I usually get the &amp;#34;you look tired&amp;#34; comments so I guess it&#x27;s working! It does go on light with no greasy after feel which is great for my oily skin. I also have recent acne scars which have started to fade not to mention I&#x27;m not breaking out as much as usual. Amen to that! So I will continue to purchase this products as long as it continues to work for me.</li>
    <li> Maple Holistics Natural Facial Serum is&lt;br /&gt;one of those things you would want if you&lt;br /&gt;were trapped on an island and could only&lt;br /&gt;take one thing! : ) I love that is is highly&lt;br /&gt;concentrated vitamin c yet free of preservatives. I can truly see the difference that using an all natural product&lt;br /&gt;makes on my skin. I will always have a jar&lt;br /&gt;in my medivine cabinet. It is lightweight, not oily or greasy and smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I was given free sample of this product in order to provide a review.  My opinion is totally my own.  I have used it for about two weeks now and I have seen no improvement in my skin.  I have been using it on my chest as well as my face.  I like to pamper myself with skincare and this is a failure in that regard.  It is very medicinal  -reminds me of the strong prescription Retin-A I used in my teenage years.  I give it 3 stars because of the natural ingredients and the reasonable price. Based on the reviews, it may work for some people.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this Facial Serum because my skin is feeling dull and rough due to a brutal winter. After just one use I was shocked at how baby soft my skin felt when I woke up this morning. I will be adding this to my daily regimen because it is fantastic so far!</li>
    <li> The first bottle I received worked great! It even reduced inflammation and then finally cleared up the eczema patches near my eyes, which is the first product to ever do that, so when it ran low I ordered another bottle. The second bottle of product looks nothing like the first bottle I received--which was a deep yellow color. The liquid in the second bottle is see through and feels watery like plain mineral oil, which I&#x27;m assuming it is because my eczema has returned and my complexion looks much different than when I used the first bottle. Very disappointing in the inconsistency of the product.</li>
