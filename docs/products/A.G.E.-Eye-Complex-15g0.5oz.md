      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Reduces fine lines and puffiness around the eye.  </li>
      <li>I have used the Skin Ceutical regimen for a few years now and I am very happy with the products .</li>
      <li>Nice eye cream, very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Did not help a lot with puffiness.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>Just started using just 2 weeks ago, I did not see any significant difference yet,may have to wait and see.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams over the years for dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness under my eyes but without a doubt this is the best product I&#x27;ve used by far.</li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this fabulous product!</li>
      <li>I think after a period of time it is good to switch  skin products just like shampoos as long as they are quality products</li>
      <li>but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
      <li>recommended by my doctor, and well worth the money,</li>
      <li>you do the right choise the skin quality improves</li>
      <li>Exactly what your eye area needs.</li>
      <li>Good results after a few days.  </li>
      <li>It really works to reverse the aging process.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>thing I really like about this cream is that I can put it on under my powder eye shadow.  </li>
      <li>and I really need it.  </li>
      <li>, so I was excited to try their eye cream when I other brand ran out.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price, especially considering how much I&#x27;ve paid in department stores for skin care, and my 0.5 oz is going on its second month so far.</li>
      <li>but I noticed them starting to grow fainter, and I&#x27;m going to give credit to this cream because I don&#x27;t have any less stress, or get any more sleep than I ever have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and definitely has gotten my dark circles under control.</li>
      <li>This is expensive, but while I used it I got more comments about how rested and well I looked, how pretty my eyes looked.  </li>
      <li>I am using it since a long time and have almost no wrinkles in the eye area, so I can really recommend it.</li>
      <li>My only reasons for 4 stars is the texture which is a little thick but does go on nicely once it&#x27;s on your skin and the container</li>
      <li>and I can say that it really does help with dark circles and puffy eye lids.  </li>
      <li>Usually my eye creams are too moist to use under makeup, but this one is just right.  </li>
      <li>It does very well reducing the dark circles under my eyes, but only reducing.</li>

    <li> For the price I&#x27;m quite disappointed.  I will go back to Sephora when this is gone and continue using the Loreal ROC line. It&#x27;s their best seller and results are FAST on fine lines by the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is expensive, but while I used it I got more comments about how rested and well I looked, how pretty my eyes looked.  I use other, less expensive eye products, but only with the AGE Eye Complex did I get compliments. It really works to reverse the aging process. I&#x27;m 55, and this product took away the aging look I have with out it. I will buy more when my budget allows.</li>
    <li> Used it for years.  Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best eyecream on the planet!</li>
    <li> It seems to help the skin below the eyes.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream ever!!!!</li>
    <li> recommended by my doctor, and well worth the money,</li>
    <li> I started out using Skin Ceuticals by way of their 50 SPF sunscreen and it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used, so I was excited to try their eye cream when I other brand ran out.  I&#x27;ve been using the A.G.E. Eye Complex for a month now and I can say that it really does help with dark circles and puffy eye lids.  Of course cutting out salty-processed foods is a big help too, but this cream does do what it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use a lot of highlighter for my dark circles but I noticed them starting to grow fainter, and I&#x27;m going to give credit to this cream because I don&#x27;t have any less stress, or get any more sleep than I ever have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like about this cream is that I can put it on under my powder eye shadow.  Usually my eye creams are too moist to use under makeup, but this one is just right.  Now I can use an eye cream day and night and I really need it.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, I still look my age, but a well-taken-care-of, rather than a worn-out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the price, especially considering how much I&#x27;ve paid in department stores for skin care, and my 0.5 oz is going on its second month so far. I&#x27;m sold on Skin Ceuticals and will consider more of their skin care when I finish with my expensive department store brands.</li>
    <li> Best eye cream product</li>
    <li> Product was good! Great transaction</li>
    <li> It does very well reducing the dark circles under my eyes, but only reducing.</li>
    <li> I am using it since a long time and have almost no wrinkles in the eye area, so I can really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use this at night after applying the Skinceuticals CE Ferulic. Really helps with hydrating the thin skin around my eyes. Seems to minimize my crows feet somewhat.</li>
    <li> Just started to use this cream. So far it&#x27;s great on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Reduces fine lines and puffiness around the eye.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Has reduced my under eye circles.  Helps wrinkles.  Have used for about out 1 year now.  Received promptly.  Would buy from again.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Can notice a difference after 1 week of using this</li>
    <li> Best eye cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Like the eye cream alot..not too greesy. Keeps puffiness at bay.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, no lines just smooth skin</li>
    <li> This product is truely effective for under eye puffiness. I have never found anything that works as well</li>
    <li> I have used the Skin Ceutical regimen for a few years now and I am very happy with the products . This is the only product I have been been unable to get in the professional size . I was using Obaji products prior . I think after a period of time it is good to switch  skin products just like shampoos as long as they are quality products</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very heavy cream, so you only need a small amount. It is also kinda pasty, so I have to really rub it in or it feels heavy on my eyes. It&#x27;s just okay, but I probably will try to find another product.</li>
    <li> Great product and service</li>
    <li> Great product. I have been using it for a year.  It reduced the appearance of my wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
    <li> Just started using just 2 weeks ago, I did not see any significant difference yet,may have to wait and see.</li>
    <li> So far, I&#x27;m very happy with this product, which I started using about two months ago on the recommendation of my dermatoligist. In fact, over the years I have experimented with a number of skin care products, and have come to settle on the entire Skin Ceuticals line. Although expensive, they&#x27;re not unreasonable, and they consistently deliver. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Goes on great. Not greasy.  It&#x27;s going to last a long time.</li>
    <li> Package was delivered as promised.  Love the product.</li>
    <li> Good results after a few days.  Goes on smooth and definitely has gotten my dark circles under control. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams over the years for dark circles, wrinkles, and puffiness under my eyes but without a doubt this is the best product I&#x27;ve used by far. A little pricey but we&#x27;ll worth it. It is not an option for me to have Botox so I&#x27;ve been struggling with products for some time. Since I started using this Product my eyes are brighter and younger looking. I&#x27;ve lost that &amp;#34;tired eyes&amp;#34; look and I&#x27;ve even had complements on my eyes, appearance and aging. I would highly recommend this fabulous product!</li>
    <li> My only reasons for 4 stars is the texture which is a little thick but does go on nicely once it&#x27;s on your skin and the container is not easiest to get the product out of once you&#x27;ve used some.  Overall though I like the softness it&#x27;s brought to my eye area.</li>
    <li> So far so good. It softens lines around my eyes and doesn&#x27;t irritate and I only use a very small amount.</li>
    <li> Every cream serum for all ages and tipes of skin are sold by skinceuticals&lt;br /&gt;If you do the right choise the skin quality improves</li>
    <li> Excellent eye treatment.  Not too heavy.  Exactly what your eye area needs.</li>
    <li> Nice eye cream, very moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;Did not help a lot with puffiness.</li>
