    <li> Great polish, worth the price. Outstanding color is a bright coral, not really a red like sometimes stated. Goes well with the new coral look in today&#x27;s fashions.</li>
    <li> I love opi nail polish---it is the only way I can grow my nail longer</li>
    <li> Best summer color, a classic!</li>
    <li> What a summer color! This is a happy, feel-good shade that I might rock all July! You want bold, you got it! I bought this one for a friend too, because I loved it so much :)</li>
    <li> Definitely a warm summer color.  I have it on my fingers and toes. Opi has terrific seasonal colors.</li>
    <li> Another great coral color.</li>
    <li> Red with just the right amount of orange. It looks fresh-not heavy like some deeper reds. Super versatile if you like your nails to coordinate with your outfits. The gel and regular polish are color matched well-which doesn&#x27;t happen all the time. My manicurist says its her go to color when a client can&#x27;t make up her mind.  Pics on amazon are not true to color.</li>
    <li> I picked the Cajun Shrimp the last time I had a gel manicure and fell in love.  I usually wear a bright red, but this color is an orangey-pinkish-red and is especially perfect for summer.  Then I had a pedicure and found out that OPI also makes this as a regular polish.  I was so excited that I ordered it right away for touch-ups!  I&#x27;m very pale and this color still looks good and will look even better when I get a bit tan.</li>
    <li> i love o.p.i nail polish and this is  one of my favorite color it is bright and fun goes grate with all your spring and summer dress were. i hope this helps you! it is worth the price</li>
    <li> Love OPI product and this is new favorite color. Delivery was fast and price was great. Will product purchase again</li>
    <li> The top of the bottle was cracked and polish had leaked when I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned it and kept it because I love the color.</li>
    <li> My Go-To color is Cajun Shrimp!  Love it!</li>
    <li> I purchased this color years ago when it first came out!!  I can&#x27;t believe I found it again! I am a huge purple fan but this color is the best color O P I has ever released.  Color truly looks like a steamed shrimp.  And of course you can&#x27;t beat O P I for it&#x27;s long life.  Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiancee after she had her toes painted this color at the spa.  She loves it and it&#x27;s pretty hot.  It&#x27;s an orangey-red color.  Pretty sexy for her feet in open-toed heels.</li>
    <li> Did not receive. Have not checked to see if I was charged for it. I have it in gel and love the color.</li>
    <li> I have used this color for my toes for a long time.  I ALWAYS get compliments.  It is great for both summer or winter.  It goes with everything.</li>
    <li> Looks nothing like the color listed...it&#x27;s more of a orange which is not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Its a good color. I thought it was going to be more red than it is, it has this orange tint to it. Also should use two coats. But it is still a nice color.</li>
    <li> just love this color and simply can&#x27;t live without. I am loading up on it because one never knows when they will discontinuing it</li>
    <li> OPI polish lasts longer than other polishes I&#x27;ve used.  It has a nice shine and goes on easily.  Cajun Shrimp is one of my favorites, I end up wearing it almost exclusively through the summer as it goes well with anything. It&#x27;s a pretty color, makes me happy.</li>
    <li> Great color for summer, not a red and not an orange</li>
