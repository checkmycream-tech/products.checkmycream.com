      <li>I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s as stocking stuffers (they&#x27;re in their 20&#x27;s), and they loved them - they work perfectly in the shower with their long hair to massage the scalp.</li>

      <li>I have a disability that affects my mobility and can keep me from being able to properly wash and rinse my hair.</li>
      <li>Reasonably well-made product for what they are, but unless you are going to use these very gently, I would not recommend them.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why these are so hard to find - they are WAY better than the ones you find in stores now.  </li>
      <li>but really they are individually packaged so you can give one to someone else if desired.</li>
      <li>Bristles were just right - not too soft and not too stiff.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the brush, half of the handle broke off .</li>
      <li>Works as expected &amp; a decent deal on the pair.</li>
      <li>These shampoo brushes allow me to get the shampoo in and to brush it out again with less movement, which means less pain for me and clean hair.</li>

<li> I keep one in the shower to use wet, and one in the vanity to use dry as a brush, and recommend this product highly.</li>
<li> For years, I&#x27;ve used a similar design by Goody, but these have a slightly different feel due to different plastics in mfg.</li>
<li> The scalp feels terrific and it is so much easier to spread the shampoo and reach every hair and every inch of the scalp below thick hair.</li>
<li> I use one to shape my dry hair, and one in the bath.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, in spite of the ratings, the plastic with which these are made is pretty hard, making the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; pretty harsh on your scalp.</li>
<li> These shampoo massage brushes perform as expected.</li>
<li> I use one for myself and the other for my dogs.  </li>
<li> Still, they are cheap, and you won&#x27;t feel bad if you leave one in the shower after you checkout of your hotel.</li>
<li> It gets down to his undercoat and gets any dirt or dandruff.</li>
<li> A bit less pliable.</li>
<li> Sometimes these little gadgets are scratchy, not this one.</li>
<li> My husband&#x27;s fingers could not fit around the handles.</li>
<li> The handles were too small.</li>
<li> It has been hard to find something like these.</li>
<li> seriously I have a dog brush and they used to hate being brushed</li>
<li> The handle is one piece with the base so it can stand up to being pulled through thick hair.  </li>

    <li> Don&#x27;t know why these are so hard to find - they are WAY better than the ones you find in stores now.  Two thumbs up for old-school ingenuity!</li>
    <li> I love these combs, they work great.  I keep one in the shower for washing my hair and scrubbing my scalp and one to brush my hair out of the shower.  I have found them to be well made and hope to get many years of use out of them.</li>
    <li> Works as expected &amp; a decent deal on the pair.</li>
    <li> Great little brushes! I hold one in each hand for shampooing. These make it so much easier to have a very clean head! The scalp feels terrific and it is so much easier to spread the shampoo and reach every hair and every inch of the scalp below thick hair.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.  I used to buy the Goody ones but have not been able to find them for a couple of years. The handle is one piece with the base so it can stand up to being pulled through thick hair.  I would recommend this to anyone who has been searching for a replacement to the ones that Goody used to make.</li>
    <li> sturdy and work great</li>
    <li> The first time I used the brush, half of the handle broke off . On second thought I should have bought american made and kept the plastic out of the landfill...</li>
    <li> These are great!  The combination of scrubbing and massaging action feels wonderful, and the finger ring helps eliminate slips and drops even when covered with soap or shampoo.

    <li> Love the way is scrubs and invigorates my scalp.</li>

    <li> its there. does make the shampoo foam better</li>
    <li> Good price, well made and large size with easy to handle finger grips on the outside.  Durable and works on the scalp stimulating and cleaning at the same time.  They come in a set of two but really they are individually packaged so you can give one to someone else if desired.</li>
    <li> Bought these to shampoo my dogs. They work perfect. The dogs love them too. It has been hard to find something like these. I don&#x27;t like the rubbery ones sold for pets. These are nice firm plastic, they assist with a great shampooing and message the dogs at the same time. Would per chase again.</li>

    <li> My husband was looking 4 these brushes 4 ages in srtores. Viola I found them &amp; there great</li>
    <li> Love these shampoo brushes!  We used them as kids and 60 years later, still the best shampoo ever!  Great product for kids of all ages!</li>
    <li> Great for bathing my dog! It gets down to his undercoat and gets any dirt or dandruff. Also, I keep one in the shower for my hair. Gets any buildup from hair sprays or mouse off of the scalp.</li>
    <li> excellent value for a hard-to-find product</li>
    <li> These shampoo massage brushes perform as expected. For years, I&#x27;ve used a similar design by Goody, but these have a slightly different feel due to different plastics in mfg. A bit less pliable. Still, they are cheap, and you won&#x27;t feel bad if you leave one in the shower after you checkout of your hotel.</li>
    <li> Have used for years great product. During our move to my wife threw my brush away. I was beside myself looking for one locally. Amazon once again came threw with the product I needed. I would recommend this brush to anyone even my Mother.</li>
    <li> Solid construction and design. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I have a disability that affects my mobility and can keep me from being able to properly wash and rinse my hair. These shampoo brushes allow me to get the shampoo in and to brush it out again with less movement, which means less pain for me and clean hair. I wish I had found these sooner.</li>
    <li> I love these shampoo brushes.  I use one for myself and the other for my dogs.  For me, it massages and gets my shampoo deep into my scalp helping me get some lift at the root for styling (and it feels good too!!).  My dogs love the massage .. seriously I have a dog brush and they used to hate being brushed but when they see this in my hand ... they all come over for a brushing with tails wagging.  I also use it to distribute essential oils to my scalp and mink oil on my dogs, makes us all look gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> These are good quality brushes. I like the feeling of these in my scalp and they remove oils well. I use one to shape my dry hair, and one in the bath.</li>
    <li> The handles were too small. My husband&#x27;s fingers could not fit around the handles. The handles need to be a tad longer.</li>
    <li> Nice massaging brush. Bristles were just right - not too soft and not too stiff.</li>
