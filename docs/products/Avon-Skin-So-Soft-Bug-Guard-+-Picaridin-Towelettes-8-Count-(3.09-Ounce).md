      <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Mostly I liked that I didnt stink of deet when using these.</li>
      <li>We had no staining on our clothes, it stayed on for hours and was still effective.</li>
      <li>Effective and deet free.</li>
      <li>I love these.  </li>
      <li>Test and make sure you are not allergic to this product before using it.</li>
      <li>These are perfect to keep outside in our grill &amp;#34;cabinet&amp;#34; and give to guests.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet, they love me, I buy this stuff every year.</li>
      <li>Easy to carry in your purse and apply when needed.</li>
      <li>A lifesaver and easy to carry for travel to the Mexico and the Carribean.</li>
      <li>Non greasy, very soft, pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>It worked fine and easy to put on skin, forearms, legs and thighs.</li>
      <li>Works perfectly, I even use one and then rub the dog down with it, this keeps the mosquitos of the dog too.</li>
      <li>It has a light tropical scent sort of like banana boat, and it did make my skin sticky though the weather was humid to start.</li>
      <li>If used while fishing, a light rinse of your hands clears the product and doesn&#x27;t stick to the bait.</li>
      <li>Hoping I will have the same great results.</li>
      <li>Amazingly, this product works perfect, not only for urban mosquitoes population, but for the woods kind, that as we know, don&#x27;t respect the commercial strength repellents.</li>
      <li>I would caution that this item is good, but be careful for anyone with allergies, because most insect sprays or rubs can sometimes cause rash even though this didn&#x27;t happen to members of my family.</li>
      <li>These smell good and are easier to apply than traditional spray or lotion and isn&#x27;t as sticky either.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>One large towelette is enough to use on our 3 kids, which is really great.  </li>
      <li>i don&#x27;t know much about Picardin, but I am hopeful that it is not terribly toxic, and these smell much nicer than some of the DEET products.  </li>
      <li>The smell of this product is far better than the stinky fog of deet products.  </li>
      <li>These bug guard towelettes are so effective and so convenient that I stash them in my purse, suitcase, backpack, or any place where I may carry the bag outside.  </li>
      <li>Much easier to take with you over a bottle of liquid!</li>
      <li>I get eaten alive by mosquitos, and so do my kids, so these are indispensable.  </li>
      <li>Very practical and useful.  </li>
      <li>We live in Southern Florida, so mosquitoes are abundant.</li>
      <li>They seem mild and soft for your skin, but they kept the bugs from biting, even on summer evenings in Minnesota!</li>
      <li>These little wipes go with me in the boat, and they absolutely work - 100% effective.</li>
      <li>Really works to keep the insects away.</li>
      <li>I like it, but haven&#x27;t had to use it very  often.</li>
      <li>But these work very well.</li>
      <li>Reasonable scent</li>
      <li>The ability just to rub it on versus having to spray is so helpful, much easier to wipe on your face for example.  </li>
      <li>Others work but are stronger smelling and more likely to cause irritation to sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Having visited an area with multiple insects, it was nice to have towelettes tucked inside my purse, for those necessary &amp;#34; touch ups&amp;#34; when needed!  </li>
      <li>These were out of stock on the main website so I was very thankful to find them here on amazon.  </li>
      <li>I live in a very buggy area (ranch), and I even have issues with bug bites in the house, even after I have bug-bombed.  </li>
      <li>These have been keeping the mosquitoes here in the Ozarks away which was my main goal.</li>
      <li>You can re-use the towelette several times if you put it back in the package and fold the top over so that it doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I can keep a few in my purse, and pull them out if we are on a playground, at a bbq, or a restaurant patio at dusk and it becomes buggy.  </li>
      <li>The towelettes are large enough to use on either your whole body, or on a couple kids&#x27; bodies.  </li>
      <li>We live in Texas.  </li>
      <li>We live in an area affected by EEE</li>
      <li>I liberally rubbed the towelettes on myself before sleeping and the first night I forgot to fully do my feet and the one foot that stuck out got bit several times.</li>
      <li>enough when they first come out of the packet that two and sometimes three people could use one towelette and stay protected.  </li>
      <li>The mosquitoes here really like me and my younger daughter.</li>
      <li>We grill out frequently.  </li>
      <li>No buggies come near.</li>
      <li>After that I was careful to completely do my feet first</li>
      <li>Using the product as wipes is very convenient, and one packet is enough for one human application.</li>
      <li>The packets are a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
      <li>My 2 1/2 year old is MAJOR allergenic to mosquitoes, and this is the only product that keeps him from getting bites.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like it, but haven&#x27;t had to use it very  often.</li>
    <li> We needed portable towelettes for summer camp.  We purchased these and another brand.  Depending on the bugginess of the day given weather (rains, damp, etc.) we use either these or the other (10% v. 20% picaridin).  Effective and deet free.</li>
    <li> I love these.  I love the fact that I can keep a few in my purse, and pull them out if we are on a playground, at a bbq, or a restaurant patio at dusk and it becomes buggy.  I get eaten alive by mosquitos, and so do my kids, so these are indispensable.  A few swipes, and relief from being nibbled on.  i don&#x27;t know much about Picardin, but I am hopeful that it is not terribly toxic, and these smell much nicer than some of the DEET products.  I have these in my purse, our pool bag, our diaper bag, etc.</li>
    <li> I stocked up on these for a trip to Asia and they were great! Easy to carry in your purse and apply when needed. We even started tearing them in half and sharing them as needed since 1 towelette is soaked in the bug spray. It has a light tropical scent sort of like banana boat, and it did make my skin sticky though the weather was humid to start. Mostly I liked that I didnt stink of deet when using these.</li>
    <li> This Bug Guard Towelletes was bought for the family&#x27;s vacation to the Caribbean. It worked fine and easy to put on skin, forearms, legs and thighs. I would caution that this item is good, but be careful for anyone with allergies, because most insect sprays or rubs can sometimes cause rash even though this didn&#x27;t happen to members of my family.</li>
    <li> These are great to throw in a purse or backpack.  The product works great and has a pleasant smell.  One towel goes a long way - we pass it around and the entire family uses it.</li>
    <li> It worked well, but I became allergic to it.</li>
    <li> I went camping recently to a place with lots of mosquitoes, and this saved me. I liberally rubbed the towelettes on myself before sleeping and the first night I forgot to fully do my feet and the one foot that stuck out got bit several times. After that I was careful to completely do my feet first and then my head, neck, and arms. And no more bites. Using the product as wipes is very convenient, and one packet is enough for one human application. Individually packaged, single use tear-open plastic bags, so no liquid to spill in a backpack or travel case. Reasonable scent, I left the used towelette hanging above me in case that would also inhibit bugs. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> A lifesaver and easy to carry for travel to the Mexico and the Carribean.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly, I even use one and then rub the dog down with it, this keeps the mosquitos of the dog too.</li>
    <li> Really works to keep the insects away. Would recommend  this product for anyone who is outdoors for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> The girlfriend used one and still got bites. We didn&#x27;t notice any mosquitoes though. Weird.</li>
    <li> We travel to SE asia where the bugs are serious. We apply these towelettes every morning for all over coverage, and then depending upon our activities we may dab the deet on our ankles and wrists but it is so nice that we don&#x27;ave to coat ourselves in that nasty stuff and have this alternative.</li>
    <li> I go kayaking on bayous and lakes, where skeeters are carnivorous and aggressive. These little wipes go with me in the boat, and they absolutely work - 100% effective.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of problems in the summer with mosquitoes being attracted to me . I have used this in the past and it has worked well. I bought this for an upcoming trip to Belize. Hoping I will have the same great results.</li>
    <li> The best bug guard for kids and everyone else. We live in an area affected by EEE and I try to carry these in my purse. Others work but are stronger smelling and more likely to cause irritation to sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> These were out of stock on the main website so I was very thankful to find them here on amazon.  I wish these weren&#x27;t so expensive, but they are worth it.  One large towelette is enough to use on our 3 kids, which is really great.  These smell good and are easier to apply than traditional spray or lotion and isn&#x27;t as sticky either.</li>
    <li> These towelettes were awesome-- took them to Italy with us and everyone used them.  They are &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; enough when they first come out of the packet that two and sometimes three people could use one towelette and stay protected.  The ability just to rub it on versus having to spray is so helpful, much easier to wipe on your face for example.  When we returned from Italy I had a couple packets left that I took with me to Minnesota to visit my daughter, and now she is &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34; as well. They seem mild and soft for your skin, but they kept the bugs from biting, even on summer evenings in Minnesota!</li>
    <li> Worked hiking in Denali at dusk!</li>
    <li> Amazingly, this product works perfect, not only for urban mosquitoes population, but for the woods kind, that as we know, don&#x27;t respect the commercial strength repellents. Non greasy, very soft, pleasant scent. No chemical smell at all and doesn&#x27;t burn the skin, even on the face. If used while fishing, a light rinse of your hands clears the product and doesn&#x27;t stick to the bait.</li>
    <li> Loved this!  Having visited an area with multiple insects, it was nice to have towelettes tucked inside my purse, for those necessary &amp;#34; touch ups&amp;#34; when needed!  Much easier to take with you over a bottle of liquid!</li>
    <li> We were in Texas at the beach for almost 2 weeks.  We went to several places where the mosquitoes were crazy thick.  When we remembered to put this on, the mosquitoes didn&#x27;t touch us.  There were 2 of us, we used one wipe.  We would wet it slightly under the tap to help keep it going.  This stuff is amazing.  We applied it before dressing, and then allowed to dry for a couple minutes.  I saw comments about the awful smell.  It&#x27;s not bad.  Once this stuff dries, you can&#x27;t smell it. The smell of this product is far better than the stinky fog of deet products.  We had no staining on our clothes, it stayed on for hours and was still effective. This stuff works great for us.  I&#x27;m a mosquito magnet, they love me, I buy this stuff every year.</li>
    <li> We live in Texas.  We grill out frequently.  These are perfect to keep outside in our grill &amp;#34;cabinet&amp;#34; and give to guests.  The towelettes are large enough to use on either your whole body, or on a couple kids&#x27; bodies.  Very practical and useful.  Good price too.</li>
    <li> My 2 1/2 year old is MAJOR allergenic to mosquitoes, and this is the only product that keeps him from getting bites. We live in Southern Florida, so mosquitoes are abundant. I have tried home remedies, all commercial products, and the list goes on and on, but this is the ONLY thing that works. If you have a child or yourself are tired of getting bitten by mosquitoes, then this is the one and only product you will need.</li>
    <li> Works great. But pricey.</li>
    <li> These bug guard towelettes are so effective and so convenient that I stash them in my purse, suitcase, backpack, or any place where I may carry the bag outside.  I live in a very buggy area (ranch), and I even have issues with bug bites in the house, even after I have bug-bombed.  I use the towelettes to wipe down exposed skin (except on my face around my eyes - but on my chin, ears, neck, shoulders, arms, legs and feet) and have no issues with biting or flying insects.  In the house, I wipe my feet and ankles, since we have dogs and often have flea issues.  You can re-use the towelette several times if you put it back in the package and fold the top over so that it doesn&#x27;t evaporate.  The packets are a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> These have been keeping the mosquitoes here in the Ozarks away which was my main goal. The mosquitoes here really like me and my younger daughter. They are ruthless. But these work very well. No buggies come near. And I like that since it is a wipe, I can carefully put it on our faces, too.</li>
    <li> Test and make sure you are not allergic to this product before using it. I have never had an allergic reaction to any other type of bug repellant, and thought I would make the switch to this product because it less toxic than what I&#x27;ve been using for the last 30 years. It turns out that I am allergic to this and got splotchy red (but not itchy) spots on the places I had applied it within 10 hours. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t worsen...</li>
