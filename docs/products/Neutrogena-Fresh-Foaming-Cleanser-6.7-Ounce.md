      <li>/&gt;Always a good buy.</li>
      <li>good stuff.</li>
      <li>dont think a good cleanser needs any fancy ingredients.</li>
      <li>cleanser is really really good.  </li>
      <li>good for use during pregnancy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good value, too.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s a good product and shouldn&#x27;t put you in the charity line.</li>
      <li>I just use this is conjunction with a weekly mask + spot treatments for blemishes, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;One good cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer is all</li>
      <li>This is a good product for people who don&#x27;t need any sort of a scrub for blackheads.</li>
      <li>So I gave this to my mom who has oily non-sensitive skin, thinking the drying effect would be good for her oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I like a good, foamy lather when I wash my face</li>
      <li>This is a great product, my girl friend and I both use it, I dont need the makeup remover aspect of it but still make make face feel great and clean, she does need the makeup remover and says it works great</li>
      <li>The best part about this product is that it rinses off clean.</li>
      <li>and I was very impressed with the clean feeling after use.</li>
      <li>well,  rinses off quickly without drying out your skin wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It does a great job of removing most makeup.  </li>
      <li>foams up nice, does the job of cleaning without drying out my skin and a great price on here : )</li>
      <li>My favorite thing about it is that it removes mascara (not waterproof mascara though)!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Price-wise, I believe you can find it cheaper in Wal-Mart or Target, but we all know and love the convenience of Amazon prime!</li>
      <li>Love all Neutrogena products!</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for a couple years and love it!</li>
      <li>After using for about a week, this face wash gave me more acne than I have ever had in my life!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son who is 11. My  esthetician recommended his product. Easy to use and love how it foams up. Easy to use and wash off. Smell is good too.</li>
    <li> This soap is a very gentle cleanser for sensitive skin.  I still use  a light moisturize afterward to avoid dryness, especially in the winter.  Also, because it foams a bottle this size lasts for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Great. Clears away dirt and makeup. My dermatologist recommend it. Pretty drying, though. A follow up with a lotion is must.</li>
    <li> Great product from a great company.  I use all of their products!</li>
    <li> I see no reason to spend big money on something I&#x27;m just going to wash off.  This cleanser works as well as Clinique Foaming Cleanser and causes no reaction for my sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t take much product to work up a sudsy lather and it washes off completely without leaving behind any soapy residue.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling stripped or dry.  It removes all traces of makeup and the oily eye makeup remover I use.  It has almost no fragrance, which is good for those who are sensitive to scent.  I also like the pump, which makes dispensing the product quick and easy.  The Amazon price is quite a bit higher than what I usually pay, about $8, at the drugstore.  I have used very expensive cleansers and I don&#x27;t think they work any better.  Some tout skin care ingredients, but it&#x27;s silly to assume they do anything because the object is to wash the product off, so down the drain they go.  I&#x27;d rather spend money on a serum and eye cream.  Once in a while a drugstore brand proves itself to be as good or sometimes better than the high end skin care lines.  This is one of those cases.  This is a basic cleanser that works for all skin types.  Spend money on something that actually soaks into the skin.  I definitely recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy -- just gets the job done. Best for normal or combination skin, nothing too dry or too oily. Still prefer my pricier cleanser, but this one works well in a pinch -- especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> The face wash is good but the pump broke the first day I was using it, it just seemed cheaply made</li>
    <li> Great quality and price.</li>
    <li> Stings your eyes. Ouch!</li>
    <li> This face wash is just strong enough for my combination skin. Other cleansers either don&#x27;t get my oily zones clean or make my dry cheeks feel really tight. This one works just right. It also removes MOST makeup. Don&#x27;t expect a lot of lather though.</li>
    <li> I have used this cleanser for years and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  I experimented with another cleanser then followed with this one, and sure enough the Neutrogena found make-up residue the first one left behind.  It cleanses thoroughly and gently without making my face feel tight and dry.  It foams nicely and rinses clean.</li>
    <li> Will reorder, I ordered this instead of going to store saves me the trip and normally delivers next day which is nice</li>
    <li> This face cleanser does wonders for my skin.</li>
    <li> Dried out my sensitive skin. Smell and texture are fine but it seems to strip too much oil on my face each time I use this.</li>
    <li> Its great! Neutrogena is one of the best brands out there and this is one of their best products ever!</li>
    <li> very pleased really excellent product I can recommend it met my expectations so well that I was really very happy thank you</li>
    <li> This product was great for taking my makeup off but it dried out my skin a ton! I would recommend the Cetaphil clenser it works the same and does not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product since the Biore foam cleanser has gone way up in price here. I was hugely disappointed when I pressed down on the pump and the product dispensed with the consistency of shampoo. Yes it lathered some when I rubbed together in my hands as directed (as any soap would) but it does not foam at all. Nowhere even close does it come to a foam. It does remove your makeup well but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as &#x27;clean&#x27;. It is an ok product to use until I find something else.</li>
    <li> I have had a difficult time finding a face wash that really cleansed my face and didn&#x27;t make me have breakouts.  This works great for me.  I have oily skin and it does seem to get all of my makeup off.</li>
    <li> I liked how it forms but Its burning my eyes!!!</li>
    <li> Does a poor job cleaning, face still feels grimy after using. Leaves a slick film that is really hard to wash off.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice facial cleanser. Nice moisturizing feel on skin, but did not completely remove mascara. I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of removing the days makeup and dirt.</li>
    <li> I use this product all the time. I love that it is very gentle and can easily remove make-up and not be oily. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon because - of course - the price is better than the retail stores... yes - even better than the big &amp;#34;W&amp;#34; monster retailer - that I am learning to love to hate! LOL.</li>
    <li> This is my first time using the Neutrogena Foam Cleanser and I was very impressed with the clean feeling after use. The is minimal fragrance and the product foams nicely. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> Overpriced...shame on me for not checking the price in the drug stores!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Fresh foaming cleanser is amazing. It Removes make up easily,even waterproof, and it doesn&#x27;t sting if it gets in your eyes. It also clears you skin of dirt and oil which would have caused blemishes. This is not an acne fighting product it just cleans your skin and removes makeup. Since i started using this my face is noticeably smoother and softer. I love Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have used this Neutrogena Foaming Cleanser.  In the past I have used Shiseido facial cleaning products which are a lot more expensive.  So far I have liked Neutrogena&#x27;s light fragrance and it does do a great job removing all make up.  I do remove my eye make up using the Neutrogena towelettes before I use the foaming cleanser.</li>
    <li> After using for about a week, this face wash gave me more acne than I have ever had in my life! It also burns my eyes.</li>
    <li> So many products contain mineral oil which I am allergic to.  This cleans my face thoroughly and without drying it out.  Only thing I use now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because i always have dark mascara eyes when i wash my face. This is a good product for people who don&#x27;t need any sort of a scrub for blackheads. It takes off the make up pretty well, I do wear it every day. I usually use this product at night and a black head exfoliating in the morning.</li>
    <li> Wow, impressed and it leaves the face so clean and refreshing without a greasy or gritty feeling.  It removes the makeup and leaves face feeling refreshed.</li>
    <li> This is the cleanser / make-up remover I use twice a day. It never leaves my skin tight or dry. My husband loves it for oil control. It&#x27;s a great value.</li>
    <li> best face wash. it does a great job at removing all of my makeup and it removes fast. it also leaves your skin feeling really clean and smooth. love it.</li>
    <li> First time try for this great cleanser . . . needed to replace what I normally use but I just don&#x27;t &#x27;enjoy&#x27; shopping! Neutrogena brand name is well recognized and the cost was way less than what I&#x27;ve used. Easy to use pump bottle that is attractive enough to keep in a limited space. Dampen hands, add small amount of cleanser and watch it foam. Gently smooth/light massage over face and rinse with cool/lukewarm water splash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the past months I have started using new products that are Amazon available . . . really impressed with the results. 68 years old with mature sensitive skin and that deep brow line wrinkle has almost vanished  and the fine lines are gone. Neutrogena Fresh Foam is the perfect way to begin &#x27;clean!&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products you might be interested in trying: Freeman Cucumber or Pomegranate Peel Masks, Roc Deep Wrinkle with Retinol (both day and night), Smoothies, and Simple eye gel. Body: Aveeno 24 hour moisture and simply radiant body wash, c Booth honey almond firming lotion and dry oil mist. If this reads as &#x27;too much,&#x27; it takes 20 minutes or less each day!</li>
    <li> this product really does clean your face really well. itreally makes your skin feel fresher and clean and it helps take off your makeup too!</li>
    <li> They all say they will take your make up off and only do it haft way. This works, is gental, smells good and very creamy. A little goes a very long way. Super good stuff and at a great price</li>
    <li> It feels soft and silky to the touch.  Cleanses well.  At first I thought it left my skin dry, but after a few weeks of using it my complexion is even toned.</li>
    <li> First of all it&#x27;s not really very \\&quot;foaming at all\\&quot;. And if you have dry skin like I do, it leaves your face feeling pretty tight afterwards.  I don&#x27;t hate it but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
    <li> My skin is combination/oily so I wanted a cleanser that was effective, quick, and takes everything off. Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser is that product. The  lather/foam leaves skin feeling clean but not stripped. It&#x27;s oil and soap-free, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and is hypoallergenic (doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, no weird scents.) It&#x27;s a good value, too.</li>
    <li> Works and you get it cheaper on here then at a store. Takes my make-up off and doesn&#x27;t dry or break out my face. Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I usually try and stay with gentle face washes, this seems to work just fine though. Even the GF likes it.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite foamng cleanser. A simple followup with the wash cloth cleans your face squeeky clean and leaves it soft</li>
    <li> Neutrogena products usually do not fail me.  I have hyper-sensitive skin and this product easily takes mascara and lipstick off and cleanses makeup and airborne dirt leaving your skin feeling nice and soft.  I would highly recommend if your skin is sensitive or not.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash because it does not dry out my face and removes make up including mascara.</li>
    <li> This cleanser never feels heavy or sticky.  It leaves a clean, light feeling on my skin and I really like it.</li>
    <li> This is a decent cleanser.  I still haven&#x27;t found the perfect face cleanser, but have alternated between Philosophy, Purpose and this Neutrogena one for a few years.  It has a light scent.  It lathers up nicely and removes most of my makeup in the first wash.  My gel eyeliner still tends to stay on so I still need a separate eye makeup remover, but the rest seems to wash off well.  I sometimes do two washes at night.  No irritation.  Does not seem to strip my skin.  (I have oily/combination skin).  Does a good job for the price and I like the pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real con is that it does not travel well.  This pump leaks a ton, even when new from Amazon.  It&#x27;s worse if you try to pack it in your suitcase.  I either use another brand or I transfer some to a leakproof jar if I&#x27;m traveling.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products but I am a little disappointed in this one.  They call it a foaming cleanser but I am not sure what you have to do to get it to foam. It does not.  I like a good, foamy lather when I wash my face and I can barely get any foam at all from this product.  I have a different Neutrogena cleanser that doesn&#x27;t say anything about foaming and I can get more foam from that one than I can get from this one.  Also, it stinks!  The smell is really bad.  I will not be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I try to find cleansers that say &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; because it means there is low risk of me being allergic to it. I tried this out and not only did it feel moisturizing and cleansing but it got my make up off no problem!!! Great bang for your buck.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, because I read an article that stated it would be good for sensitive skin, which I am prone to acne breakout, slight rosacea and oily t-zone. I could not believe it, this product did not dry my skin out. The cost was very reasonable.  I am sold on Neutrogena and probably use this product indefinitely.</li>
    <li> I stop buying makeup remover thanks to this product. I originally bought it as a regular face cleanser, but it works better than any make-up remover I ever bought.</li>
    <li> This product keeps my face clean and bright, and I don&#x27;t feel dragged down at all. I need to refresh my supply!</li>
    <li> I got this cleanser after reading about it on Paula&#x27;s Choice and that it was rated as one of the Best Products out there.&lt;br /&gt;After using it, I get it. My skin feels soft and clear. The scent is pretty gentle and not overpowering and I like the gentle foam.&lt;br /&gt;I use this twice a day and have not noticed any dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I hugely prefer this over the original Neutrogena formula (you know, the orangey one?).</li>
    <li> SAVES ME MONEY !!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for several months and have plenty left!, I use about a dime size amount. Everyday and that&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;all I need. I wear make up 4-5 days a week everything except blush. this removes it all . I have oily and fairly&lt;br /&gt;sensitive skin, NO BREAKOUTS. This for me is THE best MAKE UP REMOVER  bar none!!. Smells nice,&lt;br /&gt;lathers well,  rinses off quickly without drying out your skin wonderful product. IF my review has helped, click yes below.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, all reviewers appreciate feedback.</li>
    <li> Removes makeup well and keeps my mildly oily skin clean without overdrying.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is awesome-sauce and don&#x27;t judge the content of my review based on the fact that I use the word, &amp;#34;awesome-sauce,&amp;#34; but what better way can I describe my savior from oils?  I did a search on Amazon for a oil-free cleanser because I&#x27;ve always had oily skin.  Also, my skin isn&#x27;t a normal oily.  It&#x27;s oily to a point where a little girl once asked me, &amp;#34;Why is your skin so greasy?&amp;#34; :-|  True story.  That was about twelve years ago, but it sticks out in my mind.  Anywho (I digress), I read in some of the reviews that the cleanser was very drying.  So since I have abnormally oily skin, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;Self, you should try this out.&amp;#34; I have and must say that it has saved me!  Skin that was normally oil within an hour of applying makeup, is not dry, but is also not shiny.  It now appears that I have a healthy glow, even that my skin is rejuvenated.  I started using this along with the [[ASIN:B000052ZB8 Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Combination Skin, 4 Ounce]] and find that the combination together is doing a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the reviews did mention breakouts when not using the product and I would have to agree with the same.  If I happen to fall asleep with my makeup on (which I do often and likely contributes to my cycle of oily skin), then I do get a breakout here and there, so I definitely recommend consistency with use - morning and evening.  All I can say is that this cleanser is awesome for removing makeup as well as calming oily skin.  I would recommend.  With regards to over-drying, I could see how it might be over-drying for someone with dry or even normal skin, so try at your own risk or maybe even just once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price-wise, I believe you can find it cheaper in Wal-Mart or Target, but we all know and love the convenience of Amazon prime!</li>
    <li> My purchase arrived early!  Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser produces a rich foam.  Only 1 pump is needed to clean your entire face.  Clean scent;  yet not overly fragrant.  Leaves your face refreshingly clean.  Doesn&#x27;t dry the face.  Excellent value for 6.7 ounce bottle.  Love all Neutrogena products!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. I use it daily. I completely eliminated any other make-up remover, since this works so well removing make up AND cleaning my skin at the same time. It feels great and is very refreshing.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleaner.  I</li>
    <li> I really like this product. I use it in the morning and it leaves my skin fresh and not dry at all. Also, I like to use this instead of a cleansing milk + toner, when I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have much time and to clean my skin and remove make up. Easy to pump and clean in just a few seconds. Really nice.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser.  Effective, gentle to skin, good buy!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  good for use during pregnancy when you can&#x27;t use anti-acne, anti-aging or other products with lots of chemicals in them.</li>
    <li> I gues it works taking off makeup and mascara but it dried my skin out real bad and I have oily skin but my skin was just too dry</li>
    <li> Its gentle on my very sensitive skin. I am acne prone also doesn&#x27;t make me break out! Takes my make up off easy! But I would have wanted it to be more foamy. You use more to get that foamy texture.</li>
    <li> Drying and for some reason caused me to break out despite being non-comedogenic, again probably due to the drying. Your face will feel very tight and uncomfortable. It does break down makeup very well so i ended up using it to get the makeup off my beauty blender and brushes but never going on my face again.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite foaming cleanser, it&#x27;s better than Philosophies Purity or any other cleanser I have tried. I would highly recommend this and Neutrogena&#x27;s Moisturizing Cream cleanser for dry and acne-prone skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using this face wash for years, and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t break me out, washes off clean and easy, and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry or oily. I wear makeup to work ( 8 to 11 hour shifts), and this is the only thing I will use to wash my face when I get home. I recommend it to my friends and family, and now my 74 yr old mother uses it and she has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cleanser for several years now and can&#x27;t imagine using anything else.  Good price on Amazon :)The product arrived quickly and as described.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best makeup remover/cleansers I have tried. It even removes mascara and heavy eyeliner. Good for dry skin too.</li>
    <li> This is the only face soap I use, period. I try to bring it with me when I travel but it&#x27;s tricky because you can&#x27;t really seal the pump top.  It&#x27;s gentle, foams easily, removes makeup, and washes off without a trace.  Doesn&#x27;t even hurt if it gets in your eyes!</li>
    <li> Did not like this product. Smells awful and it after using it I did not get that fresh clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this. I´ve been using it for a while. It helped to get rid of my acne and it lasts forever since you only need a tiny amount to clean your whole face.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser is perfect! (Just so you know, I have combination skin and I&#x27;m acne prone.) It easily takes off my make up and whatever else happened to be trapped on my face! I feel so clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> You cannot go wrong with Neutrogena.  Works well in the Caribbean;  keeps the skin clean and great to remove makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always a good buy.</li>
    <li> It cleanse even the most stubborn make up on my face though it does sting my eyes. I would recommend neutrogena eye makeup remover for those of us looking for a gentle yet effective way to remove water proof mascara.</li>
    <li> I use a medium to heavy coverage concealer and this product reliably gets it off when other products have failed.  My skin is sensitive and breaks out easily and this stuff has always been fine for me.  After I use it, my skin feels clean and a touch dry because it seems to wash away your natural oils as well as the gunk.  Not a bad thing for some of us.  Works great as a stain remover for makeup on clothes as well!</li>
    <li> Yes same thing here, used this makeup for years.  Cleans the makeup off my face easily, feels great.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years now.  It&#x27;s effective, removes make up, and doesn&#x27;t over dry my face.  It&#x27;s not too rough, either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Origins Checks and Blances and was trying to find something comparable. This product is okay and a lower price than my favorite, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but this cleanser my skin look red and dry. I didn&#x27;t like the smell either. I usually like neutrogena products, but not this one.</li>
    <li> The product is good, I&#x27;ve used it a number of times, but the packaging is not good. Most of the liquid leaked in the plastic bag in which the bottle was enclosed in.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena formulates and delivers excellent, gentle, dermatologist-recommended skin care at a reasonable price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One dermatologist once told me that it is wasteful to spend money on boutique skin care products.  \\&quot;One good cleanser, a toner, and a moisturizer is all you need.\\&quot;  The kind of product you need is different for each skin type, but the truth is, there aren&#x27;t that many skin types.  Everyone can use a non-allergenic, unscented, gentle cleanser.  This foaming cleanser has a mild soapy scent, but otherwise meets all these criteria.  It is an opaque, pearlescent lubricant, but suds gently with water, and applies without stinging or harshness, even when a little gets into eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most cosmetics are washed off without problems, including water-proof mascara.  Usually I use about 1 tsp, apply over my face, then rinse with cold water.  Cold water is better than hot, because it was not wash away the skin&#x27;s essential oils, which help prevent drying.  A couple of people in the family have a history of childhood skin problems like acne and eczema.  This cleanser is gentle enough for sensitive skin.  I apply moisturizer morning and evening, and do use one with SPF 15 (even at night---just easier to use one moisturizer).  A moisturizer with alpha-hydroxy acid helps to remove dead skin on the superficial layers.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a couple years. This is the best foaming cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried many big brands such as lancome, clique, chanel... I cant say I didnt like their cleansers, but nothing beats Neutrogena cleanser especially at this price.&lt;br /&gt;I dont think a good cleanser needs any fancy ingredients. As long as it cleans my face completely, and can be rinsed off easily with no residues left on my face. Even if sometimes with make up on , it cleans my face properly.&lt;br /&gt;So girls there is really no need to spend dollars on cleansers from fancy brands, save the money to buy their serums and creams!</li>
    <li> Fresh Foaming Cleanser is a cleanser and makeup remover in one. Removing makeup before you go to bed has never been easier. This dermatologist-tested formula effectively removes dirt, oil and makeup. It even removes eye makeup, without soaps or oils that can sting or irritate the sensitive eye area. No more raccoon eyes! It rinses completely and won&#x27;t leave any pore-clogging residue. Forget the excuses and get refreshingly clean skin and complete makeup removal in one step. Soap-free Oil-free Non-comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores) Hypoallergenic</li>
    <li> It says you can use it to remove eye makeup but I haven&#x27;t been able to do so without it bothering my eyes. I thought I could use this to replace eye makeup remover. It&#x27;s okay for my face but I probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This works great for me.  Takes makeup off and cleans my skin in one product.  Note: I do not wear water proof makeup, so I cannot testify to that.  not drying. not greasy</li>
    <li> i love facial soap that is foamy and great for the skin for this product is tested and approved by skin doctors so with that in mind you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, my girl friend and I both use it, I dont need the makeup remover aspect of it but still make make face feel great and clean, she does need the makeup remover and says it works great, i dont see any makeup on the pillow casses so it must be, other stuff in the past would leave marks on our clean bed. has a nice smell to it, and the price is unbeatable, I love all neutrogena products and this one is no diffrence, Thank you Neutrogena and thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I really love this cleanser it is quick &amp; efficient  &amp; not drying  I bought it first in new York  whilst visiting my  son  I am very sorry it is not sold in the u k , although I bought it at a really good price from amazon. I must say too that it removes make up  well.</li>
    <li> Este jabon es maravilloso para eliminar el maquillaje, me encanta, es perfecto para lavarse la cara cada noche. Remueve el maquillaje y limpia la piel.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser is really good! I am using everyday, I can recommend this item to my friends. But the problem is packaging was bad.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent service!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years and love it! I have combo/oily skin and some breakouts. I use this every night and it gets all the makeup off and you don&#x27;t even have to use a toner afterward. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It is very smooth...I had expected it to foam as you pump based on the name, but you can just lather it up in your hands instead.  I think it feels fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> hey, im 13 and i love neeutrogena. this product is amazing. it smells sort of like bleech, but still its a clean fresh smell, i like it at least. :) i got this at walmart so i can&#x27;t really say anything about the seller but i love this cleanser. awesome freshness!</li>
    <li> Been using this cleanser one a day for over a month.  Works ok- still get breakouts, but nothing really major since using this.  Shipping was quick.</li>
    <li> I use this with my Mia, as suggested by others, and it cleans nicely while being gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> I use as a daily wash and it has dried up areas where pimples reoccur.  Feels good and smells fresh.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is OK, and I will finish it but I won&#x27;t purchase it again.  One thing I don&#x27;t like is that the fragrance (a pleasant enough, citrus-y scent) still lingers on my face even after I have rinsed very thoroughly.  Also, at times it seems a little &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; and my face is reddened afterwards.  I was trying to get away from my department store cleanser and go with something more affordable, but I think I will go back to my original cleanser.  As I said, it&#x27;s not bad - I personally just don&#x27;t care for it too much.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t quite remove my foundation.  isn&#x27;t really moisterizing.</li>
    <li> Great stuff clean face</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, and this is one of the few products I can use that doesn&#x27;t cause rashes, breakouts, or other types of skin ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is a nice gel that foams. A small amount goes a long way. I use it every day and have found no problems with it this far (going on 2 years of use).</li>
    <li> Been using this for awhile now because I refuse to waste it. My skin type: combination dry/oily areas/fair/sensitive/acne-prone. This face wash drys my skin out terribly. I hate that tight dry feeling I get after using it. Sure I feel like it is taking the makeup off, but at the loss of all my skins natural oils and moisture which it really really needs! Lately my skin has been so dry and flaky so along with the colder weather and dry indoor heat this stuff is wrecking my skin! I hate it. Definitely does nothing to clear my acne, if anything it makes it worse. I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser is the perfect, gentle everyday cleanser. There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about the formula, however it is affordable, gentle on my normal/dry skin, and effective. How&#x27;s that for easy?</li>
    <li> Great cleanser.  Leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.  I use it daily with scrub to rid my face of blackheads.</li>
    <li> Dealing with a bit of a breakout on my chin/jawline area, and I thought this might help.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans off makeup &amp; dirt fairly well.  I still deal with my usual dryness.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be fine for those who don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but I think I&#x27;m going to try something else now.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> This face was seems to leave a residue on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t rinse clean.  I went back to Clinique foaming face wash and won&#x27;t change again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m acne prone and have problems with shaving, I use this product to clean my face and use it as a shaving foam/gel works great, smooth and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 3 weeks my face is clean, no more scrapes and cuts when shaving, acne gone. Highly recommended for men with shaving problems.</li>
    <li> good stuff. Best make up remover I&#x27;ve used. tends to leave my skin a little dry (as expected) but moisturize after use and it is the perfect product!</li>
    <li> Does everything I need it to do. Sturdy packaging is also a plus. Easy to dispense. My default &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product when I need makeup removed and face washed.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very tough to win against oily skin and blackheads but this product did a good job! It aims to help you solve skin problems while won&#x27;t overdry your skin.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers I have ever used. My skin is prone to acne and the cleansers I have used before really dried my skin out. I wash my face with this every morning and evening before putting on acne medication. It is light, doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell, and gentle on my skin while removing dirt. I have been using this combined with acne medicine for about three months and I have seen a lot of improvement. I hope Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t pull this one off the shelves like they did to many of their products. I love this cleanser so much !!</li>
    <li> My partner uses the green Neutrogena face cleanser but I find that is too harsh to my skin and makes it red. This cleanser is perfect for me and I use it twice a day in the shower. I find it strips the oil from my face, especially in the morning, whilst not drying out the skin too much. Perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the Neutrogena products, this one travels the best and you can close it and it doesn&#x27;t make a mess in your bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like it if Neutrogena offered a foaming head, because it comes out as a gel and you have to foam it in your hands.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser - Cleans well and removes make up well too - Does exactly what it says! Didn&#x27;t cause breakouts on my acne prone skin - WIN!</li>
    <li> This product works fantastic. I use it all the time when I have makeup to remove. It gets rid of my eye makeup so easily and it leaves my face feeling extremely clean. I love that it is oil-free also, because I tend to have oily skin already, so I don&#x27;t have to use any other steps in removng makeup and washing my face. It lathers great and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot so the bottle lasts a long time as well. Overall a fantastic cleanser for makeup removal.</li>
    <li> I had bought this from Amazon.com as I use the Neutrogena makeup wipes and was not aware of the cleanser product. I use it now to remove makeup after work as it has a nice smooth consistency with a light fragrance. It does remove the makeup and dirt off my face efficiently leaving my skin with a clean non greasy feel. Some may find this drying but I prefer the taut feel on my skin as I have sensitive skin with an oily T-Zone(nose and forehead) and some of the moisturizing conditioners I have used just make more blackheads. This product address this issue and gets rid of the shine on my nose as well as minimizing breakouts . I will continue to use the product. Thanks.</li>
    <li> It is a great product; gives me a fresh look after one use.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser is smooth on the skin and both cool and refreshing.  After using it, my face looks clean and clear.  I feel ready to face the world.</li>
    <li> I used the product because my skin was in bad shape. I love it, it had brightened my complextion and helped clear up all my skin problmes. My skin feels relaxed and clean with out the tight dry feeling. It also doubles and a makeup remover and it does a great job.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin in the summer and dry in the winter and this product is perfect for both! Cleanses without drying your skin out; you wont feel like you just had a face lift because your skin is so tight. I probably wouldnt recommend this product to someone with oily, teenage skin. May not be enough cleansing. Being 30, this has worked perfectly. My favorite thing about it is that it removes mascara (not waterproof mascara though)! One stop cleansing and make up removal!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t get all my eye make-up off, but it still does a nice job. It leaves my skin a little dry, but this could just be me.  I did expect a little more from the Neutrogena name and will be going back to St. Ives.</li>
    <li> This is going to last me forever! You only need a nickel-sized dab to foam up and wash your entire face. It&#x27;s going to last me several months!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much, and I LOVE the fact that it&#x27;s a face cleanser and takes off all my makeup at the same time - EVEN my eye makeup! :)</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is a great product line and delivers quality always. For products that we use regularly, it&#x27;s great to get them routinely delivered and at a great price.  this saves us a lot of money and trips to the retail pharmacy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s scent free and plenty of subs to give you a very clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out.</li>
    <li> I am trying lots of cleansers for their ability to take off eye makeup without stinging the eyes. I also happen to like a nice fresh smell; not real sensitive to that. This fails on all three counts.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m trying it for the first time, I like the feeling on my face is fresh and the price is OK</li>
    <li> I was seeking for a new liquid make-up remover since oil make-up removers did more harm on my acne prone skin. I was worried if this will break out my face worse than it already is, but thank goodness it didn&#x27;t. It was gentle enough to not to sting my eyes either. You would have to wash the face twice to get the make-up completely off. One facial wash won&#x27;t just cut it. Besides, I have always double washed my face anyways, so it wasn&#x27;t a biggie. You need to understand, I&#x27;ve used other cleansers that still left me with foundation residue after I swabbed cotton balls around my face even after washing several times. That totally overdries your skin. My face isn&#x27;t dry at all right after I&#x27;m done with the wash too. The price is absolutely resonable. So far so good. This is my new favorite cleanser.</li>
    <li> This is NOT foaming at all. It works up into a lather, but is definitely not foaming.  It has a gel consistency. I should have been able to tell by the pump that it was not foaming, but it explicitly states that it is foaming which is false advertising. The product is extremely drying, which I was surprised about since I expected it to be similar to the neutrogena makeup remover wipes which remove all my makeup without drying my skin. This product does remove all your makeup, however it would be best suited to oily skin.</li>
    <li> I suffer from acne and wear makeup every day. I use Revlon Color Stay foundation and put a Baremineral&#x27;s concealer powder over it, and finish with Maybeline translucent setting powder. This wash doesnt get it off. It gets off the powders and a part of the foundation, but it never does a good job. I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted Neutrogena user for years and typically only used products in the Acne Wash line.  However, now that I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, I&#x27;ve been revamping my skincare.  I&#x27;ve been moving away from using face washes with salicylic acid as it just gets washed down the drain anyway.  I decided to try this product because (1) I tend to like Neutrogena products, (2) it&#x27;s oil free, (3) it claims to remove makeup, and (4) it got good ratings from beutypedia.com, so I knew that the ingredients would be good for my skin.  Not to mention, it&#x27;s CHEAP and I&#x27;d rather spend less than $5 on a cleanser rather than $15 or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser is really really good.  It does a great job of removing most makeup.  I find that I still use eye makeup remover for my eye makeup first, but this gets off my foundation and most of my eye makeup residue if I use the product as follows.  First I wet my face with warm water.  Then I take a pump and rub it between my hands to get it to foam.  Then I rub it onto my face gently.  Then I rinse.  I repeat.  That&#x27;s it.  When I apply my toner/exfoliant afterwards the cotton ball comes up clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakouts from using this product either.  Only possible negatives?  If you have dryer skin, this may be a bit drying for you.  With my oily skin, it&#x27;s not an issue, but I think it could be for some people.  Also, contrary to claims, this can sting the eyes a bit.  Paula&#x27;s Choice Hydralight Cleanser is gentler, but since this is cheaper, I prefer it!</li>
    <li> Pro - the fresh foaming cleaser is a good product that will leave your face clean and your pores refreshed. Additionally, my girlfriend likes this product since it helps her remove her make-up easily at the end of the day. I like the fresh smell as well since it is gender neutral and can use this is my sensitive skin. Also, this product does not irritate my sensitive skin as well due to not having harsh chemicals like other sub-par brands. Thus, this is a great product to have for both females and males.  Con-none.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and am usually very picky about the cleansers I use, but I must say this one was great and I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase! The product worked very well and easily removed all my make-up. I feel like my skin has gotten cleaner and so much nicer looking because it really gets into the pores and removes a lot of the dirt you don&#x27;t normally get to remove with a basic face wash. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have dry and sensitive skin.  After using the Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser for the first time, my face felt tight but I was surprised that when I touched my face, it didn&#x27;t feel dry but instead felt soft.  So I thought to myself, maybe it&#x27;s firming my skin, which wouldn&#x27;t be a bad thing.  After only 3 days of using this cleanser, fine lines appeared on my face.  I wasn&#x27;t imagining it.  It was drying out my skin - and making me look older!  So I gave this to my mom who has oily non-sensitive skin, thinking the drying effect would be good for her oily skin.  She was not happy with the resulting dry skin and the extra fine lines on her face.</li>
    <li> This is suppose to be gentle and not drying but personally it is too drying for me. I have an tad bit oily t-zone but still I thought I would try it for under $10. I&#x27;m not sure who to recommend this for...it&#x27;s not a bad product but just can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice product really makes your face feel clean but didn&#x27;t really remove my makeup that good but I&#x27;ve only used it once so I&#x27;ll continue to see how it does.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like soaps that don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and this one leaves my face feeling like I have actually washed it. Recommended by my dermatologist. It also doesn&#x27;t strip my face at the same time. Good for those with not-young skin (I am 39) but who have oily skin considering their age.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser. It is gentle but removes all my eye makeup easy.  I dont need to&lt;br /&gt;use an eye makeup remover.  This is just the perfect cleanse, and it is a great value</li>
    <li> Gave to my grand daughter as a stocking stuffer. She couldn&#x27;t wait to use it. Didn&#x27;t even have to reminder her. Neutrogena makes the best products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve dealt with acne for years. I&#x27;m 20 years old and started out using Proactiv at age fourteen. I had tried Clean and Clear Morning Burst on and off for a couple of years, used Simple&#x27;s gel cleanser, tried Bioelements (a pricey option), Oxy brand washes, and nothing seemed to work for me. I bought two of these cleansers on a whim after finding a coupon for Neutrogena cleansers in the Sunday paper, and man am I in love! Not only does this calm my oily, acne prone skin, but it smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry me out! Using this alone (no toners or moisturizers), I&#x27;ve finally gotten my skin to clear up of any acne. I mean, I do get the occasional pimple, but I&#x27;d much rather have one stray to conquer than the mountain range that used to dominate my face. Highly recommend this to anyone who has struggled to find a good acne cleanser. Oh, and the scent is nice too!</li>
    <li> As I&#x27;m getting older I have been looking for a cleanser that will not dry my face out any more than it already is (I have some flaking on my face). I have tried every cleanser Olay offers and none worked. I used Neutrogena makeup remover wipes so I thought I&#x27;d try the cleanser as well and it worked! I use this cleanser the alcohol free toner after and Neutrogena moisturizer for combination skin and I have finally found my combo.</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this everyday. She feels it helps clean her face without causing excessive dryness. She likes this product.</li>
    <li> This works great to remove your makeup and is a great cleanser. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite cleanser to remove my makeup and clean at the same time. long time staple, can&#x27;t change or i break out. it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like other cleanser.</li>
    <li> good price, been using this product for a while. came quickly. please with price more than anything else.  _  _</li>
    <li> And it is less costly than some I have seen.  Sad to say, I have never found a product that removes make up for me in just one application.  However, it&#x27;s a good product and shouldn&#x27;t put you in the charity line.</li>
    <li> foams up nice, does the job of cleaning without drying out my skin and a great price on here : )</li>
    <li> Been using this cleanser on &amp; off for years. Removes make up well &amp; is also a refreshing foaming cleanser for everyday use.</li>
    <li> Love Nuetrogena products, this cleanses without drying out my skin. It removes make up and I love the foamy part, feels like its really getting in my pores. Since using this cleanser I have had fewer breakouts.</li>
    <li> Good cleanser, but not going be my favorite.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and I love it.  I tend to wear a lot of make up for my job and it easily cleans it all off with a few pumps - Plus, it cleans my face at the same time.  Truly makes taking makeup off a much easier task!</li>
    <li> This is the best to wash my face, I never had anyone better, unhappily we don&#x27;t have it any more at Brasil, bur every time I go to USA I buy a lot!&lt;br /&gt;I recomend for everybody</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to try this because it states it&#x27;s a makeup remover, of which I have no need for. But the product seems to work pretty good. The best part about this product is that it rinses off clean. No byproduct is left over. Does not dry out my face. Does not irritate my skin. Face feels clean. The only reason I took a star away from this product is for its strong smell. I hold my breath, it kind of stinks that bad. But it&#x27;s not bad enough to stop using it. This will be my second bottle of this stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is a great cleanser, the skin after using looks amazing. I have tried other ones, and this is the best.</li>
    <li> This cleanser was recommended to me by a dermatologist (though on my next visit, a different dermatologist never heard of it).  I don&#x27;t use it at all for makeup, but as a daily cleanser prior to my acne prescription creams (mainly differin).  It&#x27;s a great alternative to benzoyl peroxide based cleansers or toners with salicylic acid, which tend to make my face way too dry.  I use this once in the morning and at night and it does a great job at removing oil and dirt.  If I need more moisture, I use a cetaphil-based moisterizer after applying my differin cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am a 26 year-old Asian male with mild acne (cheeks, chin, jawline are my problem areas).  My skin is very oily due to the high density of my hair on my scalp.  I would say my pores are moderately large.  My skin is very sensitive to benzoyl peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, I am for the most part acne free with the occassional random pimple.  If I don&#x27;t clean my face twice a day I start to get breakouts in my problem areas.  I also like to use a high percentage salicylic gel to spot treat any pimples that pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend trying this cleanser if you have mild-moderate acne.  The 6.7 oz cleanser is rather large as it only takes a peanut size amount to cleanse your face.  It comes out as a slimey greyish-white liquid that foams with water and friction (lather in hand, not on face).  It does not travel well once open, almost every time I have tried to bring this with me on trips, it always leaks out and in large amounts.  May want to put a small amount in a travel bottle or at least store it in two ziplock bags if you take it anywhere.  However, it&#x27;s very cheap and can be purchased in the beauty isle of a number of general stores.</li>
    <li> The word &amp;#34;Foaming&amp;#34; in the label is misleading as there is no more (maybe even less) foaming action to it than the average liquid soap.  Three stars because I normally trust Neutrogena and have no reason to believe it&#x27;s not a good product otherwise,  I&#x27;d be interested in a foaming version if/when they come up with one.</li>
    <li> I really like all Neutrogena skin products and this is no exception.  It cleans the skin very well, removes all makeup, but it does dry the skin out abit.  Despite this, a great product.</li>
    <li> This product is great for the price. It clears away most of my makeup (Minus all of the eyeliner) and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without overdrying it. It doesn&#x27;t deep clean or remove acne, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to do any of that. I just use this is conjunction with a weekly mask + spot treatments for blemishes, and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products, but I really don&#x27;t care for this cleanser. I have combination/acne-prone skin and when I use this cleanser, it completely strips my skin of ALL the natural oils. Cleansers should NOT leave your skin feeling tight and dry...this then causes an over-production of oil, which too much oil causes breakouts. It leaves my skin tight and shiny and then my skin tries to compensate by producing too much oil. I switched to Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser and it leaves my skin soft, supple, and well-hydrated.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t found anything better, don&#x27;t have to use makeup remover.  My dry and oily skin also stays clear in conjunction with their oil free toner that goes with this cleanser.  I have tried quite a few other things over the years, simply because I like to jump around and I never finish the bottles and go right back to this,</li>
    <li> For some reason it did not foam too much and my face did not feel too clean.&lt;br /&gt;I like Pure much better then this!!</li>
    <li> I am allergic to every face wash out there and this one doesn&#x27;t make me itch at all. I love it and use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Purchased it a few months back but still more than halfway left. That&#x27;s after using it 2-3 times per day. Excellent product. Leaves my skin so fresh and clean... No squeaky clean so no problem of excess skin tightening. My skin has felt so soft and naturally fresh. Very mild smell so no problems there as well</li>
    <li> Works incredibly well with my crazy moody sensitive skin.  I use with an extra-gentle bufpuff.  Over time, when they ran out of their &amp;#34;favorites,&amp;#34; both my step-daugther (13) and husband tried this and have converted to using it!  We all have acne to some extent, and this cleans (including removing makeup) without stripping or irritating.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product makes my skin feel as dry as paper. If I don&#x27;t apply moisturizer right away, my skin gets red and itchy. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t foam no matter how much I apply and how vigorously I rub it on my face. And it&#x27;s pretty eye-irritating (it just stings in the eyes). Going back to Peter Thomas Roth Gentle Foaming Cleanser, even though it&#x27;s way more expensive... Oh well, my face only lives once.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face cleanser for many years. I love it. I purchase it online and have it delivered to my door because sometimes the stores would be out. I usually purchase two bottles a year. I wash my face with this cleanser every morning.</li>
    <li> My face is still oily after using it. And there are more breakouts now. I will not buy it again. I will not recommeNd it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face wash! I love how clean it makes my face feel after I use it. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get used to any other kind.</li>
    <li> I wear make-up almost every day and it was a pain removing the eyeline and mascara. This cleanser is foamy and smells nice. I have oily/acne prone skin and after using this product, instead of having an oily face like I usually do, my skin was soft and still felt clean. Great price too, will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> love it.  good item and delivery</li>
    <li> On the recommendation of a female friend 9 years ago, I started using this wash, and I&#x27;ve stayed with it ever since. I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I have an oily complexion. I wash with this once in the morning, and once before going to bed, and it keeps my skin clean. I notice that when I don&#x27;t wash with this that I have a tendency to start developing a few pimples here and there, so this definitely helps. After washing with this, I always re-moisturize with some GNC Vitamin E cream, which I&#x27;ve also been doing for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people may complain that your skin doesn&#x27;t feel clean after this, but I beg to differ. A proper wash shouldn&#x27;t be so aggressive as to strip your face of all moisture and make it squeaky clean. That&#x27;s why I like this wash: it cleans without being too harsh. Cleaning your face with something that is too harsh can actually cause your body to produce more oil in an attempt to restore whatever the wash stripped away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t testify to the makeup removing effects of this wash, but I introduced my wife to this wash and she seems to have taken a liking to it if that says anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much that I have Amazon send it to be on the subscription system.</li>
