<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very large pours. When applying foundation makeup it always seemed my pours just sucked it all in. After using this the first time I notice my pours where all most invisible and had a smooth foundation appearance. It goes on easy and does the job.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference.........</li>
    <li> Very, very good and the price is so reasonable.</li>
    <li> IT IS LIKE A LOVE/ HATE RELATION SHIP, BECAUSE IT REALLY MAKE THE FUNCTION OF PRIME THE FACE FOR MAKE UP BUT IS TOO GLOSSY AND LEAVE MY SKIN GREASY AND MAKE THE MAKEUP FEEL HEAVY.</li>
    <li> I use it, I not sure it does anything great, does not help with larger pores.</li>
    <li> Had already tried And absolutely loved this primer. I just didn&#x27;t appreciate that I couldn&#x27;t purchase a few of these alone but ONLY as an add on. Because of that, I probably WON&#x27;T Pur have again through amazon</li>
    <li> Love love love this primer.  Makeup goes on great and your skin feels like silk after application.  Have used more expensive primers and this is every bit as high of quality as the other higher priced ones.  Little goes a long way.  Will definitely keep using.</li>
    <li> I love this.  It is easy to apply and it makes my face feel so smooth, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Really like this, it makes applying make up easier and it feels so smooth on my skin. It&#x27;s really oily though.</li>
    <li> This is the best primer - as good as the more expensive ones I have used, and smooths out fine lines.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t find any benefit in using this product. It leaves your skin dull and dry and does not do well as a primer for applying make-up.</li>
    <li> I put a dab on the back of my hand then blend in a little foundation, then using your ring finger or pinkie gently smooth on where you want coverage and refining. It really does fill in pores and with some color added to it you get a smooth look. I have had a hard time finding it in stores so I have Amazon ship every couple of months. I fyou get it one too thick it will sort of ball up on your skin. Very little is needed.</li>
    <li> This is the first primer I ever tried and I never bothered to try anything else because I love it.  It feels silky, smooths out lines and pores and gives my skin a subtle pink tone to look healthy.  I swear no one paid me to say this.  Oh, and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I like this primer for a drug-store brand one.  Is it as good as Bare Minerals or Smashbox&#x27;s primers?  No.  However, it costs about 70% less.  This is good for everyday use and I save the more expensive ones for special occasions when I&#x27;m wearing heavier makeup.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT TO USE ANY TIME WHEN YOU ARE READY TO GET TO FEEL GOOD WITH YOUR SELF AND WITH ANYONE YOU WANT TO BE WITH.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It fills in the lines on my face and makes my foundation look very smooth.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;the tube lasts a very long time (I&#x27;ve had one for almost a year &amp; there&#x27;s still quite a bit of primer left)&lt;br /&gt;makes a little bit of makeup cover more surface area than more makeup and no primer would&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t really minimize my pores or wrinkles as I thought it would&lt;br /&gt;makes my skin feel a bit creamy (but I guess that stops me from touching it and getting dirt in the pores)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall it&#x27;s good and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I will be purchasing again</li>
    <li> This is the best makeup base I have used. Makeup glides on.</li>
    <li> This is a great item. The makeup looks much better on my face when I use this great Maybelline primer.</li>
    <li> I am 43 and had not purchased make up in ages and when I found out about primers I felt like I had to try several to know which one would work for me.  I didn&#x27;t want to splurge on the expensive brands until I tried the drug store ones.  I bought Neutrogena&#x27;s primer, Maybelline&#x27;s primer and L&#x27;Oreals primer.  I have few wrinkles for my age but its because I have always used evening primrose or borage oil on my face with Rose Otto, Carrot essential oil and Frankincense essential oils for 20 years so people say I look 25 and one person carded me the other day when I bought some liquor and thought I was 19.  My background in skin care: Facials since I was 12.  I&#x27;ve used Dermalogica, Lancomb, Murad,and Jan Marini, so I am used to using the better brands but with the recession, I have not been able to afford those anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What started this shopping spree and sampling different product lines was me purchasing Estee Lauders Double Wear Maximum Cover Camouflage Make Up in Creamy Vanilla at Dillards.  I thought because of the cost it would be awesome.  I live in a very cold and dry climate now (Montana) and I get broken capillaries on my cheeks in winter and I hate looking at them, but when I applied Estee Lauders foundation by the end of my work day is was as though all the foundation separated and made my pores look humongous and any dryness was so visible I was so embarrassed as I work in retail and I knew people were looking at me like I had a really crappy mask on.  I didn&#x27;t want to take back the Estee Lauder make up so I did research and found that primers were the latest and greatest.  So now that you know I am not a novice to skin care, this is my story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to read up on reviews on Amazon (love Amazon) for primers and so I bought 3 brands and have experimented in different ways.  I found [...] who recommends certain drug store brands too and so I bought Revlons Coverstay Cream foundation too, since Ally had good things to say and if you watch her blogs, you&#x27;ll be hooked.  She is a crack up.  Love that girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my results:  My skin is combo oil and dry.  I can have flaky skin and at the same time have too much sebum or oil because I&#x27;m hypothyroid and that can give you flakey skin. However I inherited my dads oily skin and larger than normal pores for women.  My large pores are on the cheeks closer to the nose than towards my out cheeks near my ears, my chin and the center of my eyebrows.  I have a small laugh lines around my eye&#x27;s but not very noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena&#x27;s shine control:  Its gritty but nothing to really complain about.  Just use enough moisturizer before hand, give it 4-5 minutes to let the moisturizer sink in to your skin and then apply Neutrogenas primer.  I waited another 3-4 minutes before I applied foundation.  I used Lancombs foundation in matte and Neutrogena&#x27;s rice protein powder afterwards.  Results: My skin stayed oil free, however the make up still had some separation around the circumference of my pores and so I felt it was too masky again.  Then I used Neutrogena Primer with Colorstay Foundation per Ally and same thing, my poors are too big.  I think Neutrogena is fine if you use the primer and then powder for a sheer look or a foundation that is super thin that doesn&#x27;t need much coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next was Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Primer. I always moisturize my face with Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream (The BEST for day use cream).  Then after 5 minutes applied Maybellines primer and it was clear, gel like and smoothed over my skin like silk.  It was very nice.  Because I know that acne is 90% diet and 10% hormonal or hygene I don&#x27;t care about the silicones because they don&#x27;t break my face out because I eat well.  If you eat fast food and bad foods, no matter what you put on your face for acne won&#x27;t work because its all coming from the inside..... onto my story:  I let the primer soak for 2 minutes this time and applied Colorstay Cream inSand Beige and Natural Beige and boy did it apply nicely.  That was a joy and it seemed to bring out the best in the foundation.  Then I applied Neutrogena&#x27;s rice powder setting powder and went to work.  End of day it was so-so, still a tad masky but I will blame that on Colorstay since it is a full coverage foundation. But Maybelline primer was better than Neutrogena&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I splurged on L&#x27;Oreal because the teller said it was her favorite.  This is a neat primer because its like stucko.  You apply it on the highly porous parts of your skin and wait a few minutes for it to &#x27;set&#x27; and then I added a tad more to fill in the pores and let that sit for a moment.  Then I decided to use Colorstay again and this was so-so.  It could be the Colorstay, have no idea yet.  But at the end of the day, slightly masky again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today I went back to an old standard foundation that is the best in my book: Dermalogica Treatment Foundation in 1g.  Love that stuff but Dermalogica does not make it anymore.  The company is sending me samples of a newer version of their foundation line.  There is something in Dermalogica&#x27;s ingrediants that prevent the pores from showing much and so today I used Maybelline Primer (so far my favorite) after the Dermalogica Skin Smoothing Cream and then added little dabs of Colorstay on my cheeks, forehead, chin and cheeks where I wanted fuller even coverage and then added my 1G Dermalogica Treatment Foundation with it.... And Viola! I found the Holy Grail.  All day long my skim was like velvet.  The foundation did not separate around the circumference of my pores and my face was &#x27;dewey&#x27; and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my bottom line so far on Drug Store Primers.  Maybelline Instant Age Rewind will be my primer of choice.  It does not break me out and its slick without being oily.  You have to try it to know.  Then I mix Revlon Colorstay foundation with my Dermalogica foundation and that creates the perfect makeup for my combination skin and oil.  I use Neutrogena Shine Control Rice Protein powder on top to set it as its very good for that.  By the end of the day, my skin looks radiant.  One thing I did do, is I used the L&#x27;Oreal primer in the small jar for my eyelids and it was alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per [...] she recommends Maybelline eye concealer that is the Brightener and she is right, it works really well.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have it.  If you have combo skin and are middle aged, mixing the drug store brands with the higher quality Dermalogica I think you will be ecstatic by the results.  Its trial and error.  But now I&#x27;m so happy my capillaries don&#x27;t show up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE MORE THING.. I also implemented the Oil Cleansing Method this week for washing my face.  Google that and do what she says. It&#x27;s amazing.  Those who have larger pores have blackheads usually.  I swear to God, the castor oil (mixed with 1 drop of essential oil of Orange) will dissolve the sebum, blackheads and your pores will eventually shrink alittle.  But this is the first time in 25 years I have actually WASHED my skin with an oil. I usually apply it after I use soap (evening primrose and borage) so this OCM is totally new to me.  After day 5 of that method, I have zero blackheads.  I usually use a Biore strip to pull then up but after 5 days of using the castor oil method of cleansing for oily skin, I tried Biore strips today and hardly anything surfaced.  The castor oil is kicking butt ladies on sebum and now my pores aren&#x27;t grey specks in need of extractions from a cosmetologist.  I&#x27;ve never been happier about getting rid of blackheads in my life.  Had I known castor oil dissolved blackheads 28 years ago when I went thru puberty I would have been doing that all along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I hope this helps y&#x27;all on the primers and what I mixed with foundation so you don&#x27;t have to buy the entire drug store to find out what works.&lt;br /&gt;TTFN</li>
    <li> There is a noticeable difference in the skins appearance after using it. The skin appears softer and smoother.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed with this product.  It doesn&#x27;t really do much for me when you talk about brightening and smoothing out lines and creases.  Feels kind of greasy when you put it on, but after it&#x27;s absorbed, the skin feels really soft.  It does help with the dry patches the show up when putting on my foundation.  Also when the package arrived, the packing was fine, but the product tube itself wasn&#x27;t sealed and it looked like it had been used previously.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  However, if you can find &amp;#34;Baby Face&amp;#34; it works better overall, although I do like the ever so slight pink tint to this one. If I had never used Baby Face I would probably love this. Will use it when I am out of Baby Face before I can get more, but it is not my go to.  Still a good primer, and better than some that are way more expensive.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. Makes your makeup go on smoothly</li>
    <li> Not too fond of this primer.  I would rather use urban decay or elf if I can&#x27;t afford the better brand.  This one does not hold to its claims</li>
    <li> To make makeup last and look good, primer is a must.  I&#x27;ve tried [[ASIN:B000UGUB1W Smashbox Photo Finish Oil Free Primer 1oz/30ml]] and [[ASIN:B000FV69MC Philosophy Supernatural Poreless/Flawless Tinted Primer, SPF 15, 1.6 Ounce]] and[[ASIN:B0037ZAHA8 Cover FX Clear Prep FX]].  All of these other primers are more expensive than this Maybelline product.  My assessment is that for most days, the Maybelline product would be a good product to use and even beats out several other expensive primers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best to apply the Maybelline primer and then wait several minutes to apply makeup.  The primer makes skin feel smooth and can create a good canvas for makeup application.  Is it the best primer?  No.  I don&#x27;t think the Maybelline product lasts as long as other primers and my makeup doesn&#x27;t feel as stable.  I think Cover FX is a better primer that lasts longer and creates an even smoother surface but the cost necessitates that it be used for special occasions only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smashbox&#x27;s primer is almost on par with the Maybelline primer.  The worst primer I have ever used was Philopshy&#x27;s Supernatural Poreless (and I love most Philosophy products).  It required many minutes before I could apply my makeup and it made my skin feel disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this Maybelline product.</li>
    <li> The Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer is a good primer to take on the road with you while traveling. Its not the best primer on the market considering the teeny tiny size with the big price tag on it but it does last awhile. I keep it in my travel bag with my travel cosmetics. If I used it daily it would be gone VERY quickly. It does a great job at preparing your skin for makeup application and smooths imperfections as well as fine lines and wrinkles. It also visibly reduces large pores.</li>
    <li> I feel like this primer didn&#x27;t really work. I would put a decent amount on then my makeup and it didn&#x27;t look smooth or like I put any primer on. I&#x27;m disappointed :/ would not buy again.</li>
    <li> Clear, silicone feel. Okay for a night out or special purpose, but not a good daily use. Face felt slick. Breakouts aren&#x27;t pretty!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing</li>
    <li> I Love it, Makes my skin feel so good!</li>
    <li> This skin primer makes your skin feel so soft.  Foundation over it just glides on.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Goes on light and smooths and soften skins. The tube is a little small, but you don&#x27;t need a lot of product and it&#x27;s a good price</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and roseacea. This covers nicely without feeling heavy, or greasy.</li>
    <li> Although the product works and goes on smooth I was expecting a larger tube, it was much smaller than I thought it would be and for the price I was unhappy.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I apply it after my moisturizer and then wait a couple of minutes before applying the make-up. It holds everything well and my make-up lasts longer into the day.</li>
    <li> WOW!!  I am amazed by this product!  I usually avoid using Maybelline products because they don&#x27;t last, but this is the exception!  A little bit of this stuff goes a long way.  If it feels greasy on your skin, you have used too much.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on high dollar primers - this one works!!!!!</li>
    <li> Patience is a virtue with this one, as it feels a little greasy when first applied, but after letting it soak in for a few minutes, it feels more like a light powder. It seems to work nicely at keeping my makeup in place, though it isn&#x27;t good enough to earn my undying allegiance.</li>
    <li> I just love this primer!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s thicker then I thought.&lt;br /&gt;not easy to apply.</li>
    <li> My pores are just as visible with or without this primer but it does make your skin feel nice. Not sure it does its purpose.</li>
    <li> So smooth and great look under makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this primer!  It goes on so smooth and just blends everything perfectly!  I am now hooked and will never wear foundation without it!</li>
    <li> Feels very smooth on skin and although I am right now wearing it I have had a lot of recommendations from friends with acne prone skin and was told it worked nicely for big pores. So far I can&#x27;t even begin to disagree.</li>
    <li> gives a nice finishing touch</li>
    <li> Gives my skin a silky, smooth feel before foundation. This is not greasy, messy or smelly. It absorbes nicely with no flaky residue and is not sticky. Also, it does not make you look shiny. Feels like satin on your skin.</li>
    <li> The reason your wrinkles and pores may seem diminished is due to the first two (2) ingredients being silicone. If you are prone to acne or milia, you may want to skip purchasing this. I also don&#x27;t notice any kind of pink glow, but no fragrance either, which is a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does is keep your make-up on most of the day. I&#x27;ve used this with minerals as well as cream-to-powder foundations and it works equally good with either type. Your make-up glides on easily; of course this is due to the silicone. I also use it as an eyeshadow primer when I&#x27;m not wearing eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you use a very TINY amount. Small pea-size for your entire face and a pin-head size for your eyes if you&#x27;re using this as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
    <li> this product is a must for under foundation.  Your foundation will go on much smoother and look kinda dewy.  this is also a great price.</li>
    <li> Very nice.  I put on a wee tiny dab in the morning.  That, with a swipe of mascara and lipstick is certainly enough for most days.  If I get dolled up, foundation just glides on.</li>
    <li> great for every day makeup</li>
    <li> I tried this Age Rewind primer because I use the Age Rewind foundation with excellent results and because of the reviews regarding this primer.  It is also excellent.  It puts the Mary Kay primer I&#x27;ve been using to shame.  This primer does smooth out the skin allowing a smoother application of the Age Rewind foundation that I also prefer.  Both are light weight and give a more natural finish to the skin.  I am interested to see how it holds up in 90 to 100+ degree heat this summer.  Please note that it takes very little of the primer to achieve good results.</li>
    <li> As a 50+ woman, I find it gets harder and harder to wear makeup without looking either overly made-up, or un-made-up and therefore old and blotchy.  I tried this Maybelline product thinking that, well, even if it didn&#x27;t work, I wouldn&#x27;t be out a huge amount of money.  But I LOVE it.  It&#x27;s mostly clear but has a very faint pink tint that I think livens up my medium Caucasian complexion.  Best of all, it makes my pores disappear and foundation go on extremely smoothly, so I need less makeup yet look healthier and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, if you use too much it will feel greasy; you only need a tiny dab.  I would recommend not putting it near your eyes as it would make your eye makeup smear, and I don&#x27;t know how it works for those with oily skin, as my skin is dry-to-normal.  I notice a slight de-emphasis of fine lines but to me the greatest benefit is how it makes my pores almost invisible.  If you&#x27;re older like me, definitely give this a try!</li>
    <li> Its a value for money. Foundation blends smoothly onto skin upon application of this primer. No complaints.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover my pores.</li>
    <li> The primer feels nice, it does leave a little matte finish, can&#x27;t say I notice a difference when I put makeup on over it.  You can&#x27;t have high expectations of wrinkles \\&quot;diminishing\\&quot;.  When using, try to avoid the eyebrows, it does leave \\&quot;chalky\\&quot; like residue.</li>
    <li> I really like this primer. It&#x27;s very affordable and looks wonderful. Only 4 stars because it lasts about 6 hours and I wish it lasted 8 - 10. But it makes makeup look fantastic and is one of the cheapest primers out there.</li>
    <li> Feels a little too oily. Coverage is ok. Gonna try something different next time.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin and I LOVE this stuff.  Sometimes I just wear it and don&#x27;t put any concealer on.  It really gives me the appearance of smoother skin.  I&#x27;m pretty pale and have fine lines and it does give the appearance of less lines.  As far as a primer...I can&#x27;t say it stays on all day or that it keeps my foundation on all day.  I don&#x27;t like a heavy look and I don&#x27;t re-apply any make-up save for my tinted lip balm, so maybe that has something to do with it?</li>
    <li> nice to make it easy to apply make-up which glides over it.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It smooths my skin and makes it look flawless. I use it under my makeup</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!!! I am in love with this primer. Makes my foundation (Maybelline FitMe) even more perfect! I like it is a wonderful product as a base.</li>
    <li> Item was as described and arrived early.</li>
    <li> Evens out dry, uneven patches and is not oily. Makeup looks GREAT! I only need a pea size drop and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Once I messed up my chin waxing :0 and I put a thick layer over it before makeup and it worked like a charm.</li>
    <li> On most days this takes the place of foundation or powder. All I add is eyeliner and a pop of blogs and my skin looks smooth and pore-free. My skin also feels baby-smooth, and the feeling lasts after I remove it. You only need a tiny amount for your whole face so it lasts.</li>
    <li> I was fairly shocked at how small the bottle is...seems to work well, but you really don&#x27;t get much for the money</li>
    <li> I do like how my skin feels when I put this on. I do think my makeup stays on longer when I put this as my base.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it all the time, takes away the shine from the forehead that seems to get a shine as the day goes on. Have used others, when I found this one it was a winner. Great price, colorless which is very nice as some have have color which interferes with you makeup color</li>
    <li> Once I discovered face primers, I continue to use them on a daily basis.  I have tried a number of face primers ranging from moderate to expensive including Smashbox.  Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer is the best face primer I have tried, and you cannot beat the price.  I would HIGHLY recommend you give this product a try.</li>
    <li> Great primer.  Makeup goes on so smoothly.  I get compliments on my makeup and this is one of my tools I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
    <li> I like this product and will buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a primer to go under my foundation.  My skin is fair and I&#x27;d say I have a normal pore size and little to minimal wrinkles/crows feet etc.  Did not reduce appearance of pores or lines on my face.  It did not make my foundation hold longer.  It goes on a bit greasy, not oily but greasy, as a matter of fact it smells like grease.  It has the consistency of petroleum jelly.  It does feel smooth when it goes on but there&#x27;s little to no absorption, it just sits on the face.  Once you add liquid foundation on top of it the foundation won&#x27;t set well.  This is just my experience with it.  My skin is dry to normal.  For myself I&#x27;d just give it a meh.</li>
    <li> I have never tried primer before, so maybe it is supposed to feel this greasy, I dont know. It did not erase any lines, visually it made no difference at all. Your skin never absorbs this stuff, it feels a lot like you are slathering vaseline on your face. After you have applied your make up, if by chance you touch your face or brush something against it, it smudges very easily, due to the texture. It does hold your make up on though, resists humidity and moisture, and makes it last a long time. This is half of what its supposed to do, so thats why I give it 3 stars. By the way, the age rewind eraser from this line is fabulous! Its only this product ive had no luck with.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I would take this primer over any &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; primer in a heartbeat. I know I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how or why this stuff does what it does but it is amazing.  Wouldn&#x27;t do without it now that I have found it!</li>
    <li> I use this before I put on my foundation and it makes it last longer. Its very smooth</li>
    <li> I have a nearly encyclopedic knowledge of beauty product reviews.  If someone on the street randomly approached me and demanded, &amp;#34;Quick!  Which makeup primers get the best ratings?&amp;#34;, I would reply, &amp;#34;Smashbox!  Laura Mercier!  Lancome!  Tarte!&amp;#34; without skipping a beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why do I use this Maybelline primer?  Well, the obvious answer is that sadly, I&#x27;m too poor to buy all my beauty products at Sephora.  However, even in the future (when I plan to be rolling in cash, naturally...) I think that I will continue to enjoy discovering great products at lower price points.  This is one of them.  I have tried all the highly-rated primers at Sephora, as well as several drugstore brands, so I feel like I&#x27;m in a pretty good position to make an assessment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear, silicone-based primer - similar to Smashbox Photo Finish.  Granted, Smashbox is an overall superior product - but at $36/1 fl. oz., you&#x27;d hope that would be the case.  Alternatively, a 0.85 fl. oz. bottle of this on Amazon is roughly $8.  Just so we&#x27;re working with an exact comparison, I took the extra 0.15 fl.oz. in the Smashbox bottle into account, putting an equivalent amount of the Maybelline primer at about $9.20.  This means that the Maybelline primer approximately 75% less expensive than Smashbox, but the results are very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I only use moisturizer before applying any sort of makeup to my skin (e.g., concealer, foundation, blush, bronzer), it often ends up looking uneven, or there can be dry patches that makeup will refuse to blend into (especially in winter).  When I apply moisturizer followed by this primer, all of my makeup goes on easily, evenly, and looks far more natural.  It has gotten to a point where I wouldn&#x27;t even bother applying any makeup to my skin without using this first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is only because I live in Manhattan, but this product is significantly more expensive in drugstores (about $13), so that&#x27;s why I buy it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> This primer is good for the price.</li>
    <li> The texture is a bit too slippery for me. It is effective as a primer but I prefer a product that disappears into the skin.</li>
    <li> Best primer I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Now, I&#x27;m 32 years old and always being told I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s which is always an ego boost. I bought this not necessarily for the \\&quot;age rewind\\&quot; bit of it but I heard it was amazing for prepping for makeup and it IS! I love it. Goes on velvetty smooth and makes my makeup look wonderful. Definitely try...</li>
    <li> Great stuff and the price is fantastic.  This works as well if not better than the more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
    <li> Need a more matte product, I have OILY skin. It was a impulse buy.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know that using a primer would really help minimize fine lines.  For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong!  I haven&#x27;t tried another primer under my foundation but I am really pleased with how this one works!  I am 42 and I think I will continue using a primer under my foundation for now on!  It makes a difference!</li>
    <li> I have never used a primer before but I do like this one.  I read up on other reviews and this one had the best reviews for the price range.  It is super slippery and smooth but it seems fine when I put on my foundation.  I have roseaca so my skin tends to look pink already and this helps to hide the fine lines or crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on all the good reviews....is a decent primer but WAY too greasy for anything more than bone-dry skin. I chucked, got 80 million zits from it.</li>
    <li> nice primer. holds the foundation a little longer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, but my Walgreens doesn&#x27;t consistently carry it any more. I like it because it makes my makeup go on more smoothly.</li>
    <li> This primer is the best thing that ever happened to me regarding makeup.  After the primer application, my makeup goes on so smoothly and evenly.  And at night I think it makes the removal of makeup easier too.  There is no need to buy any other (i.e., more expensive primer), because Maybelline works perfectly fine.</li>
    <li> it leaves my skin feeling soft and works well on the skin with foundation and makeup. Will purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This made my face feel greasy for some reason. It does work well with Bare Minerals make-up...but any other kind of foundation made my skin feel greasy.</li>
    <li> Got this pretty quick tried it and a little goes a long way .I only need it around my nose and it made a big diffence on how my makeup looked.</li>
    <li> Love product.  Leaves face feeling smooth and make-up goes on better</li>
    <li> Feels silky on your face and  makes application of foundation make up go on smoother. I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a good primer for your regular makeup for a good price. It is clear, and feels nice on my face, and really helps my makeup go on easier. I have been using it for a while and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> I love this, it&#x27;s transparent and so smooth. Easily massaged in and held the make up well.</li>
    <li> A great deal, works really well for the price range, comparable to other products like SmashBox</li>
    <li> This product makes a great makeup base. It&#x27;s easy to apply and makes my foundation go on smoothly. Last a long time.</li>
    <li> love it,  my eyeshadow lasts a lot longer now without creasing</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and works well on my oily skin</li>
    <li> This stuff works great</li>
    <li> Gives a nice smooth finish and the slight pink tint leaves skin looking fresh. Minimises and smooths the tiny lines around eyes.</li>
    <li> like any other primer</li>
    <li> This is my favorite I usually order three at a time so I don&#x27;t run out. It feels like satin on my skin. Makeup looks finished and it does help fine lines. Wish it was already in makeup so you only use one product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I believe you get what you pay for.  I find the Prime Time product I&#x27;ve used in the past is a better primer.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Foundation goes on smoother.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb :-) it really holes in the sweat and oil and left me with a Duey look after all day use so I am just loving This product....</li>
    <li> I purchased this primer along with the matching foundation in cocoa and I have to say that this is the best blended, natural looking combo I have ever found. This makeup stayed on my face from morning to night as I went to a wedding in 80 degree weather and a very hot church. By the time I got home from being out all day sweating it looked like I had just applied my makeup. I think this is a great investment and to think I purchased the primer and the foundation as a splurge product! I am a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> Got the item in record time. I have used it a few times and I like it. Very silky feeling when you put it on. My makeup doesn&#x27;t cake in my fine lines when I use this. I have gotten compliments on how I look since using this..helps me not look so tired..lol I would recommend it..works for fine lines but not really deep ones. Overall I would say this product gives you what it claims.</li>
    <li> Maybelline is just a great brand and this product is simply great1 I recommend it. Wanna get another one !</li>
    <li> I bought this a couple of months ago based on the overwhelming positive reviews I saw here on Amazon.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  This primer makes my skin feel silky all day long.  I&#x27;m 54 and have some wrinkles and very dry skin.  This primer reminds me of a very, very light weight silky Vaseline. A little goes a long way.  It provides my parched skin with just enough moisture that I really don&#x27;t need a moisturizer but I use one anyway for the SPF protection.  It also aids with blending my concealer with a lot more ease and it does not look cakey. I does not cover all of the redness my skin has but helps a lot. I apply this wait about 10 mintues then moisturizer wait 10 minutes then apply mineral powder. I know longer use a colored mineral powder I just use a mineral veil and this primer provide the staying power so it looks fresh all day.  I think it helps a bit with the wrinkles about particularly around my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took a weekend trip with my two sisters and they like it so much they stopped at Walgreens (way overpriced at $11.99) and bought it. I purchased my at Walmart for $7.99 but at this price I will start ordering from Amazon.  Its hard to find so I always have an extra tube on hand.  Great value at this price</li>
    <li> Great product, lasts all day and gives me a smooth finish!</li>
    <li> It has an incredible texture and is very soothing for the skin. It gives the skin a soft touch and good look.</li>
    <li> Works great for the price.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent primer. Great price. Only need to use a little so lasts a long time. Repeat purchase.</li>
    <li> this primer made me break out like crazy! i have very oily skin and this primer was just horrible on my skin. it seems that it would be great for someone with dry skin but definitely not for acne prone/oily skin!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for almost 2 years and love it.  I use it under my mineral powder.  It makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
    <li> This product goes on like satin...I cannot use makeup over it because it is to slick so therefore I will not use it for my face. LOL! I will however use on on my feet at bedtime...makes them very soft.....</li>
    <li> Goes on clear and SO smooth. It makes my skin feel silky afterwards and not greasy at all. I will buy it again for sure!</li>
    <li> Usually makeup sticks to my skin just fine, but when I havent had enough sleep or water it becomes really dry. On top of that after I take a shower in the morning after a night of no sleep, the skin would be extra dry. But those are the mornings/days that I REALLY need makeup in order to face the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where this primer comes along. Mind you I havent used other primers, this is my first primer. Basically I feel it acts like a moisturizer and it helps my makeup cling to my face better especially if its dry/not behaving well. I hope it stays around for a long time because I have considered it already a part of my growing makeup collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is kind of gel form, it feels oily but it doesnt shine on your face. My face is dry so I assume that is why it works for me. It is &amp;#34;age rewind&amp;#34; so maybe this primer is best suited for us mature ladies (in my early 30s) and for ladies who have dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love what this does for my skin and can not buy it locally any more, an delighted to be able to geit it through you</li>
    <li> I really like this product. Read about it in magazine not knowing it existed. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and needed this product. I gave it a 4 because I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often and don&#x27;t really have anything to compare it to.</li>
    <li> When using this product my makeup seems oilier and comes off faster.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this, I didn&#x27;t think I liked it because the texture was different than what I was used to. I am updating my review of it, because the more I used it, the more I liked it. It made the foundation go on so smooth and evenly.</li>
    <li> this product. I would highly recommend this product~ I have been using this product for about a year and I am still very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I am a make-up junky and try just about everything I can get my hands on.  When I tried this I was not sure it would be good but I was VERY surprised. It is a great primer and definitely makes the skin looked smooth and younger if that&#x27;s possible at 65 years old.  Seriously, I really liked it and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this for covering my smile lines,so far,I don&#x27;t see much different even though it does keep my make up last longer.</li>
    <li> For older, sensitive skin like mine, this is amazing stuff.  It does just what it says without feeling too heavy or oily.  Very happy with it!  It works, it&#x27;s affordable, and shipped quickly.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I used to use Smashbox Photo Finish line primer but this is way better and less than half the price! The other reviews are correct that a little goes a long way. I have normal-to-dry skin type so it works well for me. I pair it with a feather light foundation (Loreal Visible Lift) for a smooth &amp; natural but not cake-y look.</li>
    <li> does make the wrinkles  appear less wrinkly, especially if you apply make up over it. it feels like a light wax. i think it has helped my skin  become slightly  more hydrated. i like it.</li>
    <li> I have used this primer before and can not find it in the box stores anymore. I hope Amazon continues to carry it. It is reasonably priced and improves the skin surface for the application of make-up</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it really is a great base for my liquid makeup or just powder.  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> It was a gift and the person liked it. I think they will be buying more themselves next time and yea.</li>
    <li> I got samples of a similar product in the mail, but it cost over $25 for a very small tube. I tried this relatively inexpensive product on a whim. I am 59 and making make up look smooth and continue to look smooth throughout the day is challenging for my skin at this point. With this product the finish is as good as I can expect and stays in place. You need only a very small amount and it feels really good going on. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Fantastic primer goes on smooth and serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> it is really good product...skin is so soft and feels great...Amazing deal for the price...Will buy again for sure...just perfect</li>
    <li> I have to use twice as much of this as the previous tube I bought at CVS. Perhaps this batch has been sitting in the warehouse too long and it&#x27;s changing it&#x27;s chemical structure??? I have no clue but I paid 50% less for it online through Amazon but I have to use twice as much. Not a great deal, expect that I had a hard time finding it at CVS. That&#x27;s the only value-add here, it was an add-on and convenient to just receive it in the mail.</li>
    <li> Its great to get better coverage of your makeup.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer for your foundation. It is a little greasy so if you have dry or moderate skin this is perfect for you!</li>
    <li> Meh.... I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much except make me greasier.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my face super super soft.  I don&#x27;t really see much of a different in appearance or length of makeup staying on.  Plus, it seems to make my face super super shiny.  Not going to buy again.</li>
    <li> Good but the make up does not stay put all day...</li>
    <li> This is a great product ... Though I started using other products as well ... I have received so many compliments in regard to how young I look ... It&#x27;s silky and goes on effortlessly ... Great product great buy</li>
    <li> This is too thick, really.  It dries down ok, and I will use it up.  But, Sephora makes one that is better.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this in Walmart. I love this product. Your face feels so silky from just a small amount. This also makes your foundation go on perfect. The great thing is you only need a small of the primer &amp; foundation. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I do like the texture of this when I apply it but not sure it&#x27;s doing all that much for my face.  And I suppose I didn&#x27;t read the product description well enough, but I thought a primer would have some color to it but this is clear.  I guess it is supposed to allow my foundation to go on smoother but my moisturizer does that, too.  So yes, it does what it says, I guess, but I probably won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Holds makeup and blurs nicely but feels greasy putting it on and again later in the day.  I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> Where I have never noticed the fine lines going  away, I love how this makes my skin feel.  Silky soft!  I continue to buy this product only for that reason NOT for the fine lines claim.</li>
    <li> This makes my skin so smooth and velvety, the makeup goes on evenly and looks great. I wish my skin didn&#x27;t have so many discolorations, then maybe I could even skip the foundation with this product on. This primer makes it look very smooth and doesn&#x27;t settle into the fine lines and attract my foundation. I&#x27;m definitely using this for as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> Still love this product, have had good delivery and steady price.</li>
    <li> My Mom passed when she was in her 80&#x27;s.  The skin on her hands looked like a criss cross checker board.  I am 62 and mine looked the same.  First thing I did when I got this is put on my hands and the next day my hands looked normal.  It works.</li>
    <li> this is a great product - not greasy and feels good on my skin.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing to dislike on this product...Is such a great age rewind is amazing stuff. I&#x27;m happy with it. I will recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I mix my foundation and the Age Rewind Primer 50/50 before applying with a brush.  Perfection!  I highly recommend this product to anyone not wanting to look &amp;#34;made up.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So, I have to say, once I found primer, I said this is the definate way to go when applying make up, especially if you life in a humid climate or even if you want your foundation to stay on all day long.  I will have to say I love Smashbox primer, and if you are looking for just the basic primer, this is the way to go.  The texture is the same, and it will help your foundation glide on, and then stay put.  While I can&#x27;t speak to if it decreases little lines, as I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference, I can tell you my foundation can make it through a good 12 hours now in a hot and humid climate, and for 1/4 of the price of most department store primers, this is going to be in my make up bag from now on.</li>
    <li> This is the first primer I have used, but i like it. It&#x27;s cheap, and definitely helps to smooth out my concealer and makeup. I like the age rewind concealer for under eyes and red t zone (I think it has a fancy name, it&#x27;s like a little buffer stick), and they work well together. I rarely need to wear foundation with the combination of the two and a little face powder (the blue maybelline loose powder. Just realized I am a maybelline addict. Self discovery!).</li>
    <li> good replacement for the Revlon product I can no longer find.</li>
    <li> just what I wanted, but DISCONTINUED. anyone know where I can get more?</li>
    <li> Wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner!</li>
    <li> I used it before.  It makes my face feel smooth all day long.  I have compared prices to other moisturizers and found this on is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I didnt see this at Wal Mart but should have waited bc AFTER I received it I found it there and it is much, much cheaper at Wal Mart.</li>
    <li> Walmart had a place for this, but it&#x27;s always empty. I asked an associate, and she said they get stolen all the time, so I ordered online. It only takes a small amount of this gel under my makeup to make my skin soft and smooth. It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;ve been warned by my cousin that it has formaldehyde in it, but I don&#x27;t care. I like what it does. You won&#x27;t believe how silky your skin will feel!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this makeup primer. It works well. It&#x27;s not that expensive, goes on smooth and works great.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think a primer was a necessary thing until I tried it. It does make fine lines more easily covered and the price on Amazon makes it affordable.</li>
    <li> Great base for pre-makeup application.  I&#x27;ve use alot of different primers but always come back to this one.  Good price - less than any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely anti-aging, haha. But not for me. It has too much of a silicone texture when I apply it, but I can imagine it working well for others.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 3 stars only because it made my skin feel very smooth.  Other than that it is not like a primer should be.  I&#x27;ve used other high quality primers and this does not compare at all.  Does not perform as advertised.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product it goes on smoothly and is not greasy. The makeup goes over it very well. Sometimes some makeup will give me a burning sensation if I don&#x27;t use a primer . When I use this product I don&#x27;t experience that</li>
    <li> So smooth and soft. Made my makeup look flawless!!! Totally recommend this stuff!!! And its my first time trying this also.</li>
    <li> Breaks my face out a bit.. kind of greasy formula.. but makeup stays on pretty good with this product. Maybe aged skin would be better for use</li>
    <li> I used to use the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer and loved it so much, but it was SO expensive, almost $50 per tube. This product feels exactly the same - translucent, silky smooth and glides right on over my skin. It does its job. I&#x27;m very happy to have found a cheap alternative and I&#x27;m going to keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using product for over a year and like it.</li>
    <li> I like primers for my skin - this is a good one at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have been told it is wonderful and makes the whole process easier.</li>
    <li> This stuff makes your skin feel like Silk.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your foundation come on even. And the foundation stays on all day with this.&lt;br /&gt;Good delivery too!</li>
    <li> I have tried several skin primers and this is the one my makeup goes on the smoothest, I use liquid makeup and have the T-zone oily skin. This seems to help my makeup look smooth and fresh all day long..</li>
    <li> Your face feels smooth alright but makeup won&#x27;t stay in place it&#x27;s too slippery or something like that :( bad purchase</li>
    <li> This is a great primer and very smooth. The consistency is very thick so just a little bit is needed. It really worked really well to keep my makeup is looking fresh for the entire day. It is not the best but it works pretty well.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of skin primers and have been searching for the absolute best. I did a test of the following primers on my skin at the same time:&lt;br /&gt;- Chanel - Le Blanc de Chanel Sheer Illuminator&lt;br /&gt;- Philosophy - the Present&lt;br /&gt;- Philosophy - the Supernatural&lt;br /&gt;- Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind&lt;br /&gt;- DHC Velvet Skin Coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles. I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up. Here are the results I found, in ranked order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Philosophy the Supernatural: Winner. Easy to put on, did the best overall job of meeting my objectives. Very natural and excellent make-up base.&lt;br /&gt;2. Chanel: Silicon-free, which I appreciate. Definitely a great runner-up.&lt;br /&gt;3. Philosophy the Present: I don&#x27;t love this stuff but it&#x27;s better than the other two. This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines&lt;br /&gt;4. Maybelline: pure silicon. felt like smoothing on plastic and didn&#x27;t have great results.&lt;br /&gt;5. DHC Velvet Skin Coat: I hated this. again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
    <li> Good thing it was inexpensive, because it&#x27;s the first and last time I&#x27;ll buy it. I use primer everyday instead of foundation. I like e.l.f. brand but it&#x27;s expensive for how much you get in a bottle. When I use this stuff, my waterproof mascara ends up under my eyes later. I have normal to dry skin, and it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. Doesn&#x27;t soak into your skin like the other good ones I have used. Really cheap, awful stuff. Sits on top of your skin, and my blush and concealer come off. Odd.</li>
    <li> It worked great!  Actually better than the more expensive brand I was using before!  Now my foundation slips on so easily. I am very impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all with lines or wrinkles with the use of this product. It feels nice though.</li>
    <li> Great product, but it makes my skin oily.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this primer!! I usually go with Smashbox primer which I love, but this primer works just as well, if not better, and for a much better price! Very satisfied and happy I took a chance.</li>
    <li> I am 43 with oily skin and noticeable pores. Since I discovered primer, I have been trying some affordable brands (Bare Minerals Prime Time, ELF, and NYX). After reading the reviews, I went out and bought Maybelline&#x27;s Instant Age Rewind - and I am certainly not disappointed. At the same time yesterday, my skin was noticeably oilier (was wearing Prime Time) and my makeup a bit faded. Not the case today, while wearing Age Rewind. Of note, I put moisturizer on my face, let it dry, then apply just a dab of the primer to my t-zone; I am very happy and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Product feels nice on the skin and works well with other related Maybelline products.</li>
    <li> I like to mix equal amounts of this primer with my colored base and it goes on easily and reduces the color saturation.</li>
    <li> I bought my first primer Sarah McNamara&#x27;s Vanish) at Costco for $40+ and loved what it did for the appearance of my skin and the enhancement of my makeup.  Maybelline&#x27;s product is as good for a fraction of the price. After checking out primer reviews on Amazon, I could not find Maybelline&#x27;s primer at CVS, Walmart, or Walgreen&#x27;s.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  Now I&#x27;m going to stock up in case Maybelline is thinking of discontinuing it.</li>
    <li> Too greasy. I&#x27;ve been using Mary Kay primer for years and tried this as a cheaper alternative. This makes my skin feel way too greasy. Even after I apply makeup on top, my face is slippery to the touch. I also was not blown away with the way it makes my skin appear. Mary Kay primer gives my face a soft, flawless look. This does not.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe what a difference this little product makes.  Lines around my eyes, mouth, &amp; jaw line ease considerably.  Deeper lines are less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(No, I don&#x27;t look 20 years younger.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried another brand of primer and felt like I had anti-freeze on my face.  This is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought some Maybelline airbrush-finish make-up at the same time, and it flows on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(No, I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;ve been airbrushed, but it is a much smoother ---- ergo younger --- look.)</li>
    <li> I like this primer more than some high end primers I&#x27;ve tried. I like the fact that it is almost clear. Some of the primers seem to actually accentuate large pores... they fill in the pores.... but it looks like lots of tiny white dots on the skin which show even after foundation is applied. Because this is clear, it fills and smooths without that problem.</li>
    <li> Amazing primer for the price. I will only buy this from now on. Works as good as all the premium brands! Saw it advertised on the Today Show and I won&#x27;t go back to any other primer brand!</li>
    <li> I love this primer. It goes on smooth and feels so soft after applying. My make-up goes on real well after I put this primer on. I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer for about a week now. At first, I used a little bit and it didn&#x27;t seem to work - my makeup still looked cakey throughout the day. So I found a video and decided I needed to use a little more. It felt kinda greasy-feeling on my face, did seem to kinda blur my imperfections. My makeup did glide on, but the primer doesn&#x27;t really help the makeup \\&quot;stay put\\&quot; all day. In fact, the makeup seems to rub off easier because it&#x27;s on a greasy layer that&#x27;s on my skin. I don&#x27;t feel I can touch my face without every little touch rubbing off some makeup. When I take my sunglasses off, there&#x27;s makeup on them and I didn&#x27;t have all that before using the primer.&lt;br /&gt;*Now after having used the product for about 3 weeks, I&#x27;ve had to stop using it. I have started to break out on my face and I am now not using makeup at all to get my face to clear back up. If you have oily skin do NOT use this product! It&#x27;s not going to do what you need it to.</li>
    <li> I like this product. Helps my make-up glide on smoothly and look better . I would like it more if it  was  cruelty free, sadly, I don&#x27;t think it is. Bummer.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as the pricier options from department stores.  Very happy with this product!</li>
    <li> Love this product....gives a nice glow...less expensive on amazon....</li>
    <li> When I heard of this product I thought it was just another way to separate me from my money.  I&#x27;ve been using it regularly and now have subscribed to regular deliveries from Amazon.  I was expecting to put it on before I applied my liquid make-up.  Much to my amazement, all I need now is a little powder.  I&#x27;m free of liquid make-up at last.  My complexion is coarse, extremely oily and has some discoloration; but this takes care of that.  Don&#x27;t ask me how.  No more heavy feel of make-up and powder both.  I&#x27;m 69 years old and it makes me look like a woman instead of a made-up old lady. Yeah!</li>
    <li> This product glides on and makes it so easy to apply makeup.  I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I have large pores on my face. I also suffer from some acne pitting. I have used DHC&#x27;s Velvet Skin Coat with good results for years and bought this because I wanted to try something a bit less pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;The product is clear, nearly invisible - I like that. It feels pretty good on my skin -- not heavy or drying.  It somewhat diffuses light and makes pores appear SLIGHTLY less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:  Not non comedogenic. Not &amp;#34;sufficient&amp;#34; for problem skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMATION: I believe this product MIGHT work well for those with normal or near-normal skin --  those who require MINIMAL concealing/camoflaging. If you have problematic skin or require a product that truly delivers, you might want to skip this lightweight -- I do not think it will deliver.</li>
    <li> Hi, I tried a lot of primer from v. expensive ones to normal and nothing like this one. Excelent for oily skin or under finelines.</li>
    <li> It stays wherever you put it on your face: it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes like other creams, even in summer heat. Hypoallergenic. Use very little and spread it over a large area, then you put on your concealer/cover for dark eye-circles.</li>
    <li> A little disapointed. Makeup does not cover well over this primer even with a small of applied.</li>
    <li> It did reduce creases and wrinkles but it beads up on your skin, even if you let it dry , only use a little , etc. l</li>
    <li> I ordered this based on all the good reviews here, and so far I must say the positive buzz is deserved. (I&#x27;m a skin, beauty and product junkie and an amateur makeup artist, so I am always looking for good products at any price point.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to go and get my usual Korres primer (which is expensive but kind to skin), but decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I went out immediately to the local drug stores to get a larger size, and imagine my surprise when it wasn&#x27;t available! So I came back here and re-ordered in case it is discontinued (which seems to happen to some of the beauty products I love). I checked CVS, Ulta and Target, and none of those places carried it. So I came back here to order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really irritable skin, and so far no bumps or reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have what is called &#x27;normal&#x27; skin, neither oil nor dry. I like the way it makes my skin feel after I put it on. It&#x27;s velvety soft, and I also appreciate that aside from making my foundation go on smoother, it provides a barrier between the foundation and my skin.</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff.  Makes makeup go on smoothly and erases those tiny fine lines around the eyes and mouth.  Very reasonably prices and lasts a long time unless you get carried away and squeeze out too much.  My makeup bag will never be without it.</li>
    <li> I do have very sensitive skin and many things can irritate it. I found that this primer did not irritate. Make-up was easy to put on over and stayed. It also helps to mask enlarged pores.</li>
    <li> I find this great for mature skin.  Fills in wrinkles w/clear gel that makes your skin feel so soft.  Makeup used lightly over it goes on so nicely.  Know other people who use this product and they also love it!</li>
    <li> I had never used a primer before, but as I get older, I can use all the help I can get, and this is a little miracle.  When I use this primer, I always get complimented on how &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; I look.  I know for a fact that my skin looks and feels very smooth and soft with almost no visible pores.  From using this product, I have realized that you really need very little of it.  It is wonderful in the summer to stop the shiny look that the heat brings on.  I cannot imagine spending lots of money on expensive primers when this one works so well.</li>
    <li> One of the best primers on the market and reasonably priced!  I have tried expensive primers, but still feel this is the best.  I love the way it makes my skin smooth.  The small wrinkles are not as noticeable.  Sometimes I even put some on the back of my hands and they look younger.  I buy more than I needed out of fear they product may be replaced by something &#x27;new&#x27;.  Love it.  Love it. Love it.  Age 45.  Fair Skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to have a primer I could wear alone or under a light layer of foundation or powder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why but it just made my face feel sweaty - like it was blocking my pores. I&lt;br /&gt;thought maybe I was having a hormonal day so I tried it a few more times and sure enough&lt;br /&gt;the same thing - so I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> This primer applies on smoothly. The only downside for me was that this primer did not effectively prime my eyes before applying eyeshadow because the makeup did not stay on and it creased.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the product and the seller.</li>
    <li> I am not sending back but I won&#x27;t buy anymore. The product makes my face very greasy and it stays that way no matter how long I leave it on hoping for absorption before putting on my foundation.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetic junkie, and have been since junior high! So, you might say I have spent thousands on cosmetics of almost every brand out there. Maybelline has been around forever, and I can&#x27;t recall buying anything from them that wasn&#x27;t at least good. Well, this Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind Primer Skin Transformer is really, really good. Why spend big bucks on something that won&#x27;t show dramatically better results?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, in order to get the best results I recomment using this primer very sparingly. You can always build and add more later on as you see how it works for you. If you have oily skin or a t-zone problem, you should especially be wary of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the results are amazing. It makes your pores look darn near invisible, compared to how your foundation comes out without it. And, your foundation seems to look much fresher at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for a moderate price, and a company with a track record like Maybelline, I&#x27;d say go for it -- you won&#x27;t regret giving this one a try!</li>
    <li> Makes my makeup slide on.</li>
    <li> This primer is not what I expected, but I ended up liking it a lot! It is a clear, gel-type formula that goes on so smoothly. I was expecting a tinted thick primer, but this is actually much better. I always put it around my cheeks and nose and it creates a smooth surface for my foundation. It really covers up pores well! I would advise to not put it on your eyelids as eye makeup does not stick at all to it! I found that out the hard way, but I still love this product and a little bit does go a long way! I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and I&#x27;m still on the same tube! Great deal! :)</li>
    <li> Started noticing that my make-up was making the wrinkles in my forehead worse. So I looked on Amazon for something to help. I heard from a website to just use moisturizer so that is what I was doing until I received this product. Well first day I used it it broke me out around the chin area! I never break out! It is very think and feels like you are putting Vaseline on your face. Maybe there are some primers out there that do help and maybe this one helps others, but if you are like me (clear face and pretty dry skin) just use moisturizer before make-up and leave it at that.</li>
    <li> Not only does this product extend the life of my makeup, but I have not had a single pimple on my face since I started using it months ago!</li>
    <li> Works as well as an Arbonne (way more expensive) brand I&#x27;d tried at a makeup party.  Smooths and makes a nice slate to put makeup on.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, but it just isn&#x27;t as impressive as the reviews make it sound. I was hoping it would even out my complexion and prep it for makeup application, but it didn&#x27;t have that effect. Also, there isn&#x27;t a ton of product to begin with and you need a generous amount for coverage.</li>
    <li> This is a great primer for the price..It goes on silky smooth and makes makeup application a breeze....Would buy it again</li>
    <li> Great primer! Texture is velvety, nice light scent (strongly scented makeup makes me nauseous, so scent is something I notice lol) Seems to fill in pores nicely! One tip for first time users: Do not forget to wash this off at the end of the night, otherwise break outs are inevitable. It&#x27;s not the fault of the primer, just the nature of its function. Pore fillers WILL cause blemishes if not removed properly.</li>
    <li> This product felt sooo good on my face. I didn&#x27;t use the make up afterward but it felt like a great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll write my review in list form&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: A teensy Tiny smell to it, just the regular makeup smell.Not fruity or anything like that.Smells like foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price:Excellent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application:Goes on silky smooth,Has a light pink color to it.Makes foundation go on really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It does exactly what it says it is going to do.</li>
    <li> I have never used primer before, but I know others who do.  Everyone says that you have to use primer to get nice coverage for your makeup.  I have looked at it in the past but not purchased because it was too expensive, and I didn&#x27;t see a need for it.  When I saw this with its reasonable price I decided to give it a try.  It makes your face feel smooth and silky.  I don&#x27;t really notice a big difference in the way my makeup looks, but I think I use less makeup when I apply the primer first.  I love the way my skin feels after I apply the primer.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
    <li> Makes skin so soft and helps to even things out. It&#x27;s part of my new daily regimen. Light enough to wear under foundation or on it&#x27;s own for more casual days.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;ve yet to find anything that comes close, especially the higher priced brand name designer products that seem more waxy. Fill your pours with paste and wait for warm weather so it&#x27;ll melt, then cake.&lt;br /&gt;This does not do that. A few friends didn&#x27;t like the initial feel of it. I&#x27;m impressed, It doesn&#x27;t leave a &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;. Only takes a tiny amount to spread a long way. Haven&#x27;t had a &amp;#34;reaction&amp;#34; with it and the different brands of makeup.......so far.&lt;br /&gt;I tend to stockpile tubes of it in a cool dark drawer, because as soon as I find something I really like? They take it off the market or make a &amp;#34;new &amp; improved&amp;#34; version of it, which usually sucks bigtime.</li>
    <li> I selected, different in another way because it feels magnificent to the skin going on.  Oh so smooth and creamy and rich.  Not greasy like others.  Lasts all day.</li>
    <li> The face looks so cute when I apply it.</li>
    <li> This Primer is a clear gel that goes on smoothly, giving the skin a near-velvet softness. It has no smell and works great under a foundation to hide all the pores and little wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have just started using this primer. I find that I only need to apply a small amount and rub it in and continue the process on my cheeks, forehead and chin. It \\&quot;glides on\\&quot; easily.  I notice that it does make my skin turn red initially, but any initial skin irritation goes away quickly.  It feels really good on the skin and gives my skin a satiny feel.  I have no trouble with chalkiness or greasiness with this product.  The transparent gel feels light and dry on my skin.  I have been using Maybelline dream mousse foundation with sponge applicator and this seems to be a good combination.  I still need a little powder for removing shine, but other than that I see good, but not too heavy coverage from using both products.  I have fairly ruddy, splotchy cheeks and I am able to diminish the redness fairly easily.</li>
    <li> Great primer for the price no doubt. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Makes a smooth base for my foundation application.</li>
    <li> I am not a fan of this, seemed very greasy. I am use to more expensive makeup and tried this in a bind. Also did not last all that long, makeup seemed to wear off faster with this on. I guess it really just depends on your skin, makeup reacts differently to everyone.</li>
    <li> No Safety Seal No Packaging Smashed Under 28 lbs. of Cat Litter. Impressed that the tube didn&#x27;t explode but the cat litter leaked all over the rest of the contents in the box. I did not like the fact that there was no packaging with the product and found the lack of a safety seal disturbing. I tested the product and did not suffer any ill effects, but it did nothing for my pores, etc.</li>
    <li> Hard to find this primer but it is the best. A little goes a long way and I use it to help my foundation. I can&#x27;t get the foundation on without it or I will look like I am wearing a mask of makeup.</li>
    <li> I love the way this product feels silky smooth.  My make up goes on easily without caking up and it seems to make my skin look less flawed.  I have scaring so this is nice.  Also hides the pores.  I bought a similar product from Lancom but spent 3 X as much!</li>
    <li> This product is so-so. While it does leave my skin feeling very silky smooth, it seems to have no affect on my skin&#x27;s appearance. I don&#x27;t really notice any visual difference. I&#x27;ll use it because I paid for it, but I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is not for me. I believed the reviews and I shouldn&#x27;t have. It feels very greasy on my skin and makeup just wipes right off. I should have paid extra for a better primer.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic stuff.  It makes your skin look and feel so silky.  I love it.</li>
    <li> This is a great facial primer! I&#x27;m so impressed by all the products in the AgeRewind line by Maybelline and this is another one! I love it so much I&#x27;m stocking up! It does indeed perfect your imperfections. Great line coverage!</li>
    <li> I started using this a year ago and now I don&#x27;t know how I ever went without it. It allows your make to just glide over your face. So happy to have found it.</li>
    <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t read this fully because I had no idea I&#x27;d be getting 2! But I am not complaining. When I put this on it feels like silk. It makes my skin feel sooo smooth. I have only worn my makeup for 4 hours max with this product underneath,  but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I bought this even after some reviewers talked of it flaking off.  I didn&#x27;t have that problem.  I always put on a moisturizer first then the primer and some days a foundation, some days not.  I have dry mature skin and found this not to detract from my moisturizer and certainly added to the ease in applying a foundation.  I am wondering if the folks who had the flaking issue either didn&#x27;t use moisturizers as I do or as I have experienced with other primers if you do your hair with mousse or spray it then put on a primer there is an overspray or application of the hair products on your skin and this can cause the flaking.</li>
    <li> I use CC cream most of the time, so the primer is already in it. But when I want more of a full coverage look, I use this primer then liquid foundation. Might be a coincidence, but I used it before foundation the other night and went out with some friends. We took some pictures and one friend commented that I looked like my face was airbrushed. I dunno if this made the difference or what, but as someone with kind of problem skin, I sure liked hearing that! Haha.</li>
    <li> Great base for makeup! Evened out the tone and my BB cream went on so smoothly!</li>
    <li> I thought I loved this primer at one point but upon using it recently, I am not that impressed. It is silicone based and can be oily but I have dry skin and welcome the dewiness. But I don&#x27;t find that my makeup stays on much longer than without the primer on. It makes my skin feel soft and a bit silky and makeup glides on but I like primers that give me a great base for cosmetics to stay put. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to do that job as well as many others even in the same price range.</li>
    <li> This product is expensive for the size.  After using it for some time, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement, so I use it occasionally to finish it up.</li>
    <li> The worst of the primers I&#x27;ve tried. So far the best has been Lumene Crystal Radiance, but can only seem to find it (for cheap so far) in Mexico.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t my most favorite...but it&#x27;s pretty darn good.  I don&#x27;t notice that it does anything for skin tone...but it does make it silky soft so my foundation can take care of the tone.  It&#x27;s just a little heavier than I&#x27;d like.  For the price, I&#x27;ll likely keep using it.</li>
    <li> This seems to be pretty good.This was the first time I ever purchased primer so I have nothing to compare it with to be perfectly honest.I got it for good price with free shipping,got to love that.</li>
    <li> Makeup definitely lasts longer with this on.</li>
    <li> This is the first primer I have ever used so I can&#x27;t compare it to other product. It offers an even surface for foundation so it helps to make the face look smoother. I like it so far. Will try other product and see if there is any different.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I tried the Baby Skin and didnt like it. This product is the exact same thing, literally. Same exact ingredients but in different packaging.</li>
    <li> This was an add on product and I took the attitude it would be worth a try, with few expectations.  The first time I applied the primer, I was pleasantly surprised how smooth my skin looked.  My neck even had a better appearance.  I then applied my makeup and found the primer gave the makeup a good base to go on more smoothly.  I frequently give my face a break and don&#x27;t wear makeup daily.  But, when I do wear makeup, the primer will be going on first.  I&#x27;m in my mid 60&#x27;s and wish I would have found this product many years ago.</li>
    <li> It has sort of a greasy like oily texture to it when going on, but it feels smooth on the face. I find it looks and holds up really well with my foundation (Maybelline Dream Liquid Mousse Air Brush Finish) as well. My only other issue besides the beginning texture of the product is its amount - it&#x27;s much smaller than I&#x27;d expected.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a while. Does what it suppose to do. Smooth your skin when first put on, works w/foundation well. I don&#x27;t think it &amp;#34;stays&amp;#34; on, not much shine control.</li>
    <li> its an okay item. that all I can say. wont buy it again. not worth the money. couldnt tell enough to say something good about this item.</li>
    <li> Use Monistat Care Chaffing gel instead ; works better, great price. This product tends to clump together when applying to face.</li>
    <li> I found it to be too greasy for my skin.  I just used a little bit but still had to wipe it off with a tissue.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before. My skin feels like velvet. Put it on after moisturizer and before foundation. Great reviews.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin very smooth, and make-up glides over it.  It is not an all day product, and oil still seems to come through by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> Face gets extra silky smooth. Apply only a little. If put on too much, eyeshadow(power)won&#x27;t be put on.</li>
    <li> Product exactly what was ordered and exactly what was needed.  I am happy with this product.  Thank you very much.</li>
    <li> Feels like the smashbox</li>
    <li> Just simply didnt like it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work so well for me. Upon applying I let it set as I normally do with primers, and when I touched my face several minutes later it still felt fresh like it was coming off my skin- I had residue on my fingertips. I had only applied a small amount of moisturizer an hour earlier- per the instructions, using moisturizer prior to application is recommended. I then applied my foundation and it didn&#x27;t want to stick, and it settled into my pores and in the lines under my lash line. For the price I find the target brand ELF primer to work better. I&#x27;m 30- not really any wrinkles to speak of and my pores aren&#x27;t atrocious- so I would have thought this (or any) primer should have worked better.</li>
    <li> I can see a big deference on my face everytime i applying this thing, all my papy eyes is hone,, i recomend htis specially yhise age of 40s</li>
    <li> I like it very much, will buy again!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  I like this product</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! DHC makes a similar product, but it&#x27;s much more expensive. This stuff makes your skin feel like velvet! I love it even without makeup. The only bad thing about it is the smell. Smells kind of chemically. Like petroleum. Odd smell, but it goes away once it dries a little.</li>
    <li> its a great primer, I wish it would be bigger&lt;br /&gt;bur it gives a great surface tu the skin&lt;br /&gt;this line of maybelline its really good</li>
    <li> This product works really well as a primer but it also makes your skin look younger and feel smoother. I would recommend</li>
    <li> This is excellent and just as good as the more expensive primers at Sephora.  Save your money and buy this instead.</li>
    <li> Very good makeup primer for the price.</li>
    <li> Makes your face very smooth and sets it up perfectly for applying makeup. Less is more with this though, especially if you already use moisturizer before hand, and liquid makeup after, it will make your face a little oily and everything will settle into your fine lines. I like it though.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Highly recommend. It&#x27;s so smooth and last all day.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff!! It makes my make up look flawless and my skin so much younger.  Use before your favorite base make up and see the difference immediately!!</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin so this primer is great for my foundation. Some users say it is greasy, but for dry skin it works fine. The price is right and a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s small but you only need a little bit to properly prime your face so at first I was upset when I saw the size but after using it this little thing has lasted me, I will be replacing it whenever it goes empty</li>
    <li> I LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND  I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.  IT IS A VERY SMOOTH SILKY PRIMER, IT GIVES YOUR FACE THAT SMOOTH FEELING.</li>
    <li> This makes your base makeup go on very nicely, especially on mature skin.  Really like this!</li>
    <li> My first primer, so it meets my expectations.</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and I was afraid it would make me look greasy but if you use small amounts of it it&#x27;s perfect! It gives me a nice smooth finish and also my skin feels very soft.</li>
    <li> I got this after seeing all the good reviews here.  It&#x27;s really thick, I&#x27;m 29 and could honestly use a thinner formula.  It&#x27;s so thick that when I put makeup over it, it stays kind of goopy, like it slides around.  It caused my eye makeup to smudge on my upper and lower eyelids, for example.</li>
    <li> I am kind of beyond &amp;#34;Age Rewind&amp;#34; --approaching almost 70 yrs in the next few yrs,  Product is comforting to face/skin ...???Instant??? --only a Very Expensive Facelift would solve my issues!</li>
    <li> As always Maybelline Age Rewind brand works great.  This is a great under make up primer.  It moisturies without being greasy.</li>
    <li> I love this primer. I smooth this product all over my face before i apply my make up, it makes my face feel like silk! After i apply my make up i notice that it does not set in my creases under my eyes which is great. By using this primer my make up last me all day and keeps my skin looking healthy, i definitely recommand this for any women!</li>
    <li> Smooth canvas, slightly erases pores. Worth it because it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product and is exactly as described.  My only problem with it was that you use more than you think and you have to buy it again sooner than you would expect.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t begin to describe how much i love this primer!!!! I bought it because of the raving reviews I saw online and i have to agree with every single one of them! This primer miraculously transform your skin into a smooth flawless canvas, it seals your pores and turns your skin into a baby soft texture! The best primer I&#x27;ve used! Even better than high end ones! Definitively a keeper, must-have!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried 6 different primers both expensive n cheap. But this one is the Best leaves my skin Soft, Pores smaller, Less oily with just a pea size amount. I highly recommend it!! N good price.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good, but it doesn&#x27;t minimize pores at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It is not too oily for my skin and my makeup does last longer when I put this on. It makes my face feel extremely soft and I love that.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little more oily-feeling than I&#x27;d like.</li>
    <li> I really like this face cream.  I have used it for a couple of months and still like it.</li>
    <li> I know this is not a natural cosmetic but I just can’t do my makeup without this primer. How many tubes I’ve used so far? Oh Gosh! At least 5 so far. For me, using the same product is so unusual. I guess I like it so much because it makes my skin so smooth so the makeup lasts longer. At least I think so. Also check  the price of this primer. Super affordable! I’ll keep using it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before this. I don&#x27;t know why. This is really nice. Use with the Age Rewind Makeup, you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This primer makes my face feel like silk. It is so nice to apply tinted moisturizer or BB cream over it, but I have also worn it alone. It just makes everything on my face smoother--it smooths over pores, any lines and creases, and even makes blemishes easier to conceal. I only need to use a very small amount, just a little more than the size of a pea for my whole face, so a tube usually lasts me a couple of months. I am not sure how well it would work with oily skin. I have combination skin with some dryness, and it is perfect for my complexion.</li>
    <li> OMG.  This stuff is amazing.  It is cheap as hell compared to the other products that minimize pore appearance, but it is way better than anything else I have tried.  It has a slightly oily feel to it so you definitely need to put on powder after you apply it, but it makes pores disappear.  Absolutely recommend using this product.</li>
    <li> I like it, just a lil oily. Other than that it holds makeup nearly all day and smooths face, nice prep for foundation.</li>
    <li> I like the product. It makes my skin feel soft and moist. I use it before using my make-up. My aunt uses it tool</li>
    <li> Works almost as well as my Murad serum, which is $50. (although the Murad is still my favorite)...so for the price, scoop these up.</li>
    <li> Well even though is not a bad primer completly it doesen&#x27;t work for my oily skin at all , it doesnt help my foundation stay longer either but it does help to make my pores less visible and my fine lines and it does help to apply my foundation smoother . so if you dont hAve oily skin i think it will totally work for you</li>
    <li> I will buy this product again...I like the way it makes my skin feel, very soft, it does give the skin a glow after applying makeup.  Also, seems to make your face have a fresh look about it, even at the end of the day.  Makeup doesn&#x27;t get that caked on look after 7 or 8 hours.  It goes on very easy, you don&#x27;t need to use much, just a very small dab.  But do wait 3 to 4 minutes after applying before you put on makeup.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t help keep my makeup lasting. But good moisturizer</li>
    <li> I say &#x27;seemingly&#x27; because I have no way of knowing if the ingredients/properties/etc are identical to the Smashbox variety - but I can tell you that this much cheaper Maybelline brand version works remarkably the SAME way as the overpriced Smashbox version.  I use this everyday after my daily moisturizer and before my foundation application and it does create a much smoother base and a more glowy finish.  Save your $ and go with this one - there are so many more important make-up items to go broke over than primer!  -- like a nice BB cream!</li>
    <li> I really hoped this was going to be a great value since this primer received so many good reviews and is so reasonably priced, but I just don&#x27;t like it.  It makes my skin too slipper so when I put makeup on (I use Bare Escentuals) it seems to just slide right off.  I guess I&#x27;ll continue to hunt for the perfect makeup primer...</li>
    <li> I love the product but again it came without a protective seal and was bent with product leaching out.  I will not use unprotected products so I guess I will buy from the store</li>
    <li> I bought this based on the glowing reviews and I think this product lives up to them. To be fair, besides samples from Sephora, this is the first Primer I have ever used. I give it glowing accolades because last month, I spent two grueling days in the sun in Grant Park in Chicago. It was hot and usually my makeup would have melted off of me. This, paired with barely any makeup had my face even and glowing in a noticeable way in pictures where everyone else is sweaty, shiny and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with makeup, this product makes me feel better about wearing makeup. As a late 30-something woman who loved wearing makeup as a teenager, I find that the older I get, the worse I look in makeup. Frankly, that is fine, but there are times I want to wear a bright eyeshadow or lipstick and somehow when I see it put together, it kind of looks old and clown-like. When I wear the primer under my makeup, it cleans the lines and smooths the face to really bring out and smooth things. Makeup trends look much more tightly executed. For it&#x27;s price, it&#x27;s a great product and I will continue to use it. For the record, I have tried Smashbox and Laura Geller, both were too thick for my liking. Also--you have to apply this product with your fingertips or with a brush. If you rub it in your hands, you will be like, \\&quot;Hey, where did it go?\\&quot; and your hands will be really smooth. :)</li>
    <li> Love the velvety feel of this product!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t care for this that much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product a few times and I like it. I have only tried two different brands of face primer, well, maybe 3 but this was pretty good to me. Its not super pricey and gets the job done.</li>
    <li> i feel like even when i use this my makeup doesnt even last 5 hours,</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and look</li>
    <li> A little greasy but works well enough.  MUCH cheaper than department store brand I&#x27;d been using.</li>
    <li> This primer feels like puffy vaseline (which is nice!!) and keeps my face and neck smooth all day. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is great for the price. The only thing that keeps it from being 5-star is that for some reason it makes my waterproof mascara smear under my eyes. I&#x27;ve even tried using a &amp;#34;fixer&amp;#34; product to help alleviate this problem, but it&#x27;s still an issue. The mascara will wipe away easily, though, so it&#x27;s not a total loss.</li>
    <li> I tried almost all the drugstore primers and many of the dept store primers to smooth my fine lines and reduce the deeper ones  when wearing foundation.  Smashbox was the best and this one is almost as good for a fourth of the price. It goes on very smoothly and helps your foundation look better than wearing it alone or over a regular moisturizer. When you put it on, let it set for a minute or two. Then add concealer, foundation and blush. I get a lot of compliments on my makeup when I use it. Another reviewer said it works great in humid climates. I live in the desert and it works very well here, too.  This is a real good deal, price wise, especially at the Amazon price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now 3 months later.&lt;br /&gt; I still love it. I found if I first put on concealer in my worst areas, circles under the eyes and the line between nose and corners of mouth, and then this primer and then foundation and blush I look even better.  It is not what thay say to do in the magazines but it sure works great for me.</li>
    <li> I feel like it creates a nice barrier between the harmful stuff in makeup and my skin. I&#x27;m not sure I see much age rewinding though.</li>
    <li> to grease didnt care for this and after being at work for 30 min. it ws flaking on my face may hv worked for some just not for me</li>
    <li> I have previously been buying expensive primers from companies such as Smashbox and Arbonne, but I like this one just as much. I think it does the job just as well and for a fraction of the price. I won&#x27;t be wasting the extra $30-40 difference in price to buy those brands again. I&#x27;m hooked on this primer. I have had it since September and I am still on my first tube, so it lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
    <li> This is some super stuff.  If you have not tried you do not know what you are missing.  Great great skin stuff.</li>
    <li> I like this primer. It glides on very smooth and feels silky.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice and helps foundation look flawless</li>
    <li> My wife loves the product</li>
    <li> This makes your face feel so smooth and actually makes the make up application a lot more even.  Nice product.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Love it for my dry skin</li>
    <li> I was concerned at first the primer would be too &amp;#34;greasy.&amp;#34;  Actually it was great to use under my regular makeup.  Would recommend if you want a good primer.  I found myself using less foundation.</li>
    <li> This works well, I like it!</li>
    <li> I felt like this made my face super greasy.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and so has my daughter and daughter-in-law.</li>
    <li> When I apply I can actually feel and see the silicone spreading all over my face. It doesn&#x27;t produce any significant difference in terms of pore camouflaging or smoothing up the complexion. It&#x27;s just an OK primer to me.</li>
    <li> Im 37yrs old and I was looking for a primer that would help foundation stay longer.  Its very &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; when I put on my face but when I put my foundation, it lumps up..  I tried putting it on and waiting a few minutes but still doest work.. Also, my foundation did not stay on longer with the primier.. I do not recommend!</li>
    <li> Feels so soft....gentle and feels good on the skin.  I use it before makeup and the makeup goes on smooth and I need only a little.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t show as good as other products used</li>
    <li> It gives a bit of greenhouse effect on the face, but it primes uneven skin pretty well, so the foundation looks more even after this primer goes first.</li>
    <li> Product is OK.  Quality is good. I have sensitive, combination skin and it did not cause any breakouts.  I just didn&#x27;t like they way it &amp;#34;layed&amp;#34; on my skin. I will be trying another product in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like this. Small amount though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before make up before so I&#x27;m not really sure what to look for but it feels nice when I put it on.</li>
    <li> It is okay. Good condition.</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Been using for few years! Very smooth. Only need to use very small amount.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping!! Same price as store but delivered to your door.</li>
    <li> Hmm, eye shadow still creases...</li>
    <li> My skin literally feels like silk after using this</li>
    <li> Very nice for the price and works as good as more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Hee price for this product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Love the feeling it leaves on your face, very smooth and extra soft. Does blur pores and makes skin look flawless. A little pricey for the amount of product but worth it because it is a dupe for Benefits Porefessional. Very pleased with this product!</li>
    <li> I used Smashbox primer from Sephora for years but at $42 a pop it&#x27;s more expensive than my foundation! SO I tried a few different primers and found that this one is practically IDENTICAL to it! For this price and performance I am giving it 5 stars!!!!! This is the &amp;#34;find&amp;#34; that my wallet needed and it&#x27;s perfect for drier skin. My makeup stays on all day in Florida! Other &amp;#34;finds&amp;#34;. For the most waterproof mascara in the world (requires patient removal but will last through a scuba dive even..) COVERGIRL Lash Blast in Waterproof. Remove slowly and gently with baby oil. Let it sit...then wipe... Foundation...I love Sephora&#x27;s Tarte brand Amazonian Clay full coverage foundation! It&#x27;s waterproof! I live in Florida where it is hot and himid and this stuff passes the summerSea World test! Water, humidity, heat....It can handle it all and you will look beautiful all day no matter the weather. :-) ENJOY!</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;m not an older lady by any means. I&#x27;m 31 and have very youthful skin. Most people think I&#x27;m in my early 20s. With that being said, I like this product over a lot of other primers because it&#x27;s not heavy and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. I find that if I don&#x27;t have a primer on, foundations (liquid or powder) clog my pores terribly. This has helped with that situation. I&#x27;m not sure how the age rewind part of the primer works, I guess if I start looking like a teenager (sans zits), I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
    <li> This primer is as dense as petroleum jelly. it&#x27;s hard to get as little as you need, and hard to distribute evenly on the skin. It does not set up and dry. It remains tacky and attracts makeup like a magnet, so you use and waste too much foundation. It clings to brushes. The pink tint is not noticeable. The last of the primer remains in the tube, another waste. It would be easier to use and less wasteful if sold in a jar. The best primer is from BE, and the Maybelline product is not even in the running.[[ASIN:B0017U10SI bareMinerals Original Prime Time Foundation Primer]]</li>
    <li> this is not a good product for my skin after applying makeup looks bright, I prefer my previous first. not recommended for very oily skins because not many hours long makeup. good packaging good time of arrival.</li>
    <li> Feels so nice on my skin</li>
    <li> leaves you greasy even 30 minutes after applying. Will stick with e.l.f. for daily primer</li>
