<li> It&#x27;s just missing a few key ingredients that they put in \\&quot; X \\&quot;</li>
<li> Simply put... this is a poor man&#x27;s Clive Christian \\&quot; X \\&quot; ( my chanteuse, my muse, my Holy Grail of Men&#x27;s fragrances ).&lt;br</li>
<li> I was a little hesitant to order this item because I owned this cologne before</li>
<li> maybe can be no original, when you are wearing you cant feel the smell in your bodies.</li>
<li> Been using it for over 10 years without fail or deviation.</li>
<li> and it was an expensive one.</li>
<li> What a disappointment!</li>

    <li> I was a little hesitant to order this item because I owned this cologne before and it was an expensive one. I got it in the mail within 5-7 days and it was what I wanted and it was an excellent price. considering ordering a second one just to have in stock because i think this particular cologne is no longer manufactured.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be PERFECTLY HONEST... as a fragrance connoisseur, I NEVER WANTED TO WRITE A REVIEW FOR THIS FRAGRANCE!!!  Why... it&#x27;s TOO GOOD!!!  IF I WROTE A GLOWING REVIEW FOR THIS FRAGRANCE THEN EVERY TOM, DICK AND HARRY WOULD READ MY OTHER REVIEWS AND THEY WOULD SEE THAT THIS FRAGRANCE IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF MEN&#x27;S FRAGRANCES.  Simply put... this is a poor man&#x27;s Clive Christian \\&quot; X \\&quot; ( my chanteuse, my muse, my Holy Grail of Men&#x27;s fragrances ).&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s just missing a few key ingredients that they put in \\&quot; X \\&quot; but this is the prototype, or a type of animal that is closely related to it.  Be sure to buy the one that is made in ITALY to appreciate the greatness of this fragrance.  I buy it for $20 at a time and you should see my s***-eating grin as I walk out of the store... bravo to the creator of this great perfume and to Salvatore Ferragamo for putting his name on this masterpiece!</li>
    <li> The smell doesnt lasting! maybe can be no original, when you are wearing you cant feel the smell in your bodies.</li>
    <li> Perfect timing.  He ran out today!  He loves this stuff.  Been using it for over 10 years without fail or deviation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many men&#x27;s fragrances and Ferragamo by Ferragamo is a bit different. It has a refined and classy smell that is very Italian. This cologne lasts for several hours. It smells like wood mixed with a light citrus. This is a fragrance that you can spray fairly liberally without offending anyone. I think it would probably work best in warm weather. What&#x27;s interesting is the way the wood dominates this fragrance rather than the citrus.    For the price Ferragamo by Ferragamo is a pretty good deal. It&#x27;s a masculine fragrance that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I gave this fragrance 3 stars because it&#x27;s not something I enjoy smelling nearly as much as other fragrances on the market. If you like a woody smell with some citrus thrown in then give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I just love it ! It is my favorite one, i use it every day and it last for hours.</li>
    <li> Love the scent but fragrance seems to be weak, does not last.</li>
    <li> Its an ok smell,not too strong and it does not last for too long,i guess its ok for the price</li>
    <li> What a disappointment! The smell isn&#x27;t good as compared to black Salvatore Ferragamo. I was first impressed because of the smell of the black model wearing by my friend so I went to buy this model without doing some research on it. The perfume does not last long and I personally do not like its smell. Overall, waste of money!</li>
    <li> It was not what I ordered.  I gave it to my son. Very dissatisfied.  Normally I get what I ordered . Not this time.</li>
    <li> Looks like this has made a comeback after a gap. Excellent cologne. Sophisticated, classy, &#x27;spicy&#x27;. Long lasting (over 6 hours). Purchased it via Groupon though.</li>
    <li> Not availabl in storse , i like it ,i used it before</li>
    <li> This men&#x27;s cologne is incredible and long lasting a mix of exotic woods and citrus,with a staying power that dares to be challenged.&lt;br /&gt;I have worn this before from time to time and it seems that I keep returning to it ,again and again.Its masculine and it fades very well ,a must for the well dressed man...</li>
    <li> Very nice, clean smell. Delivery was fast and on time.</li>
    <li> Smell&#x27;s great and good price</li>
    <li> I bought it for my brother and he love it .</li>
    <li> This article is best recommended. It really was what I was looking through Amazon I found what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Yuck! If you&#x27;re a camp fire, fishing, beans and cornbread type of guy and The woods are your second home this sent is just for you.</li>
