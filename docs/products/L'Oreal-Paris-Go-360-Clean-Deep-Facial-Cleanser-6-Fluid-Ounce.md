<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Leaves skin soft and radiant, lightweight formula with a mildly medicinal scent but it lathers well and rinses off easy. Does a good job of controlling acne and maintaining skin as a daily facial wash without causing dryness.</li>
    <li> love the scrubblet! makes my skin feel great! shipped fast! great product! will def buy again</li>
    <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel</li>
    <li> I liked this facial cleanser because it leaves my face feeling very soft. The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like is that my forehead starting breaking out after using this product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - I have super dry skin and this works so well without drying my skin out. The scrublet is awesome and helps to really clean out your pores, and you can see your makeup coming off on the scrublet which is kind of cool - you can see it working!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for my really sensitive skin but it HAS NOT BEEN WORKING. My skin still doesn&#x27;t take criticism well, it can&#x27;t watch violent movies and it&#x27;s still desperate for everyone&#x27;s approval.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, acne prone skin.  This product is amazing!  Using daily I&#x27;ve noticed I have far fewer breakouts, but most amazingly my skin isn&#x27;t dry and flaky anymore!!!  I have used hundred dollar cleansers and moisturizers, all of the expensive store brands and I either have acne or my skin is waaaaay too dry.  I bought this product not expecting much at all while I was out of one of my expensive cleansers.  I was blown away with how soft it made my skin feel, and that finally, finally my skin wasn&#x27;t overdried.  It&#x27;s enough to make my break-out prone skin behave and keep my skin clean, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like most products do.</li>
    <li> Keep my fave from breaking out!  I love the little scrubber!  This doesn&#x27;t dry my face out either!</li>
    <li> I bought L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Go 360 Clean Deep Facial Cleanser when I went to the store and they were out of the cleanser I&#x27;ve been using for the past several years.  I found the idea of a cleanser with its own little scrubbie built into the bottle intriguing.  The cleanser is very nice: it&#x27;s creamy, but leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean, not greasy.  The scrubbie is small and very flexible, which means it can conform to the contours of my face as I use it.  It&#x27;s also quite soft, and cleans thoroughly without the slightest hint of abrasion.  This cleanser and scrubbie just leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and soft.  After use, the scrubbie can be pushed back into its place in the bottle, or it can be suctioned to the side of the tub until its next use.  The cap for the bottle is the only thing I&#x27;d change.  It&#x27;s rounded rather than flat, which means you can&#x27;t stand it up easily so that the product slids down to the cap for easy dispensing.  I&#x27;d suggest the L&#x27;Oreal company use a flat cap in the future.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new cleanser, I&#x27;d suggest giving L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Clean Deep Facial Cleanser a try--it&#x27;s an excellent new product!</li>
    <li> Hi,   I bought this product from Walmart after I ran out of my previous Neutrogena acne face wash. I thought this product was reasonably priced for its size. I had trouble determining which one of the Go 360 Cleans I should buy and in the end decided to go for the white and pink bottle for sensitive skin. I had very low expectations from this product as I have tried numerous acne products in the past.    Before I proceed further, let me give you an idea of what my skin is like. I have acne prone skin with acne, acne marks and some scars. I have an oily T zone but my cheeks tend to dry out due to the use of salicylic acid products.     I have now had this product for over a month and I LOVE IT! It is perfect for my skin. It gives a consistent even clean with a nice clean feeling. It has significantly reduced my blackheads. I also feel that it has reduced the size of pores by a trace amount. It has reduced my breakouts and acne a lot. I was not expecting miracles from a 6 dollar bottle, but this product has exceeded my expectations.    The product does make the skin feel dry after consistent use for sometime. So that is something to consider if you have dry skin. I have combination skin and I use it consistently. I use a oil-free moisturizer and sunscreen after this and it prevents my skin from drying up. I have also tried using the scrublet with some other acne face wash I had at home and it worked well. So, you could also use the scrublet with some other face wash you that you like.    I would recommend this product to anyone with acne/oily/combination skin. For dry skin I would recommend using this over summer/using with a moisturizer/or using it sporadically instead of every day. This is because the scrublet causes the face wash to foam and the skin to dry a little.     Give nice clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I am 48 years old with Rosacea and oily skin. I have tried dozens of products and still haven&#x27;t found any that I love - including this one.  It doesn&#x27;t irate my skin but I don&#x27;t feel like it gets all of my make up off every time. I prefer a foaming wash to a creamy one like this so I alternate between this and a foaming cleanser.  My skin is doing well so I guess this is working, but I haven&#x27;t given up the quest for the perfect cleanser.  The scrubber is very soft so that is definitely good for sensitive skin. I will keep using that even with another product.</li>
    <li> I bought this primarily for the attached face scrubber.  It is just the right size for travel (the scrubber, not the cleanser).  The cleanser is good too</li>
    <li> I was putting lots of stuff on my wish list and when I had realized what the price was for this item, I decided it was high time for me to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Facial Cleanser, Sensitive Skin, actually surprised me by not only cleaning my face, but by also keeping it moisturized and keeps me from getting the problem acne on my face, of which I have due to menopause. So, yes, I am totally impressed and love this stuff as I only need just less than a dime sized dollop to cleanse my whole face! This will last me a VERY long time! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for around a month now, and I&#x27;m finding it to be a really nice product. My skin is less troublesome than it was before, and the scrublet leaves my face feeling really clean and fresh. I have sensitive, combination skin, and would recommend this to anyone with similar.</li>
    <li> The scrubber that is included is nice. I have sensitive skin, and this does not irritate it. It doesn&#x27;t always remove all my makeup though, so a follow-up with toner is needed.</li>
    <li> I love the little scrubber! My face feels clean and not greasy at the end of the day</li>
    <li> This is an awesome facial soap that is tough on dirt yet mild on skin! I have especially sensitive skin on my cheeks that would feel dry after applying an \\&quot;ordinary\\&quot; body soap. I decided to shop around for a facial cleanser that would clean thoroughly but not dry the skin, and found that this fits the bill. I now use it regularly in my shower for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the scrubber that comes with this soap, and can&#x27;t comment on it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for about two weeks. The scrubbie that pops out of the bottle is amazing on your skin, it is unbelievably soft and gentle. It follows the contours of your face extremely well and cleans your skin gently. I am not overly thrilled about the actual cleanser, although it is unscented and mild, it still dries out my skin, so hence the 4 star rather then 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser has an innovative facial scrubber made out of soft rubber that is attached to the bottle and that makes it very convenient. Also, don&#x27;t let my description of rubber throw you off because it is soft and gentle for the face and rinses off very well. When you&#x27;re done with the scrubber it attaches back in/on the bottle.  The cleanser does well at cleaning and is still gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> Producto muy recomendado por sus caracteristicas hipoalergenicas. Quede muy satisfecha. Me deja la piel calmada y sin alergias, lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years.  I don&#x27;t use the scrublet though, my skin does not like manual exfoliation, I just like the cleanser.  My skin is sensitive acne prone and this works great for me.</li>
    <li> OMG I love it so fragrant Its so interesting</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans the skin sooooo good !!!&lt;br /&gt;Great for make up remover ! It does it all , and the scrublet is so soft that cleans the pore from deep inside the skin. So happy with the product.</li>
    <li> This product left my face smooth each time after usage, and my skin became less oily!!! Try it out you might love it too</li>
    <li> Excellent mild wash with no medication. Very gentle and soft on the skin unless you wash twice and then it can become caustic on sensitive sin. The scrublet is a wonderful inclusion, in fact I think it is what really makes the product special. Those little silicone scrublets do a great job lifting visible sebum out of pores.</li>
    <li> So wanted to love this! Skin felt clean but not tight. After washing I used micellar water and nothing showed! However after a few days I just started breaking out all over and that&#x27;s very unusual for me. Chalked it up to &amp;#34;purging&amp;#34; but after two weeks I just have up.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, but found this product to be perfect.  It cleans and polishes the skin without being too abrasive.  The design of the little \\&quot;scrub brush\\&quot; that pops right out of the bottle of cleanser is very convenient--works  well as a soft brush, washes off easily, then pops right back in so you are not looking all over for it next time. The price of this product so decent (unlike most) that I use it daily without any hesitation.</li>
    <li> This is a very effective cleanser for the price, thoroughly removes make up!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cool concept. Great price but don&#x27;t see much difference from previous products</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. I can no longer find this cleanser in store so I&#x27;m glad I can still buy it thru amazon</li>
    <li> I really like this cleanser. Smooth and lathers up very nicely. Gentle on my skin and easy to use with the attached cleansing brush. Also leaves my face feeling clean and moisturized. Will continue to buy this since it is so hard to find a good cleanser that I like.</li>
    <li> It is quiet good but i actually use it to clean my makeup brushes and it is AMAZING!</li>
    <li> this product cleans the skin and the pad massages it in a good way, however, it drys out your skin with several usage.</li>
    <li> leaves my skin feeling nice and light</li>
    <li> Gentle and still gets my face clean.</li>
    <li> i love love this cleanser! it removes my foundation and makeup better than any makeup remover so i use it as my cleanser and makeup remover! i have acne prone skin and this cleanser doesn&#x27;t break me out with cystics which makes me happy! highly recommend! and as for the scrublet thing..i don&#x27;t really use it. i don&#x27;t find that it really works.</li>
    <li> I love this product! After using this for a week, my skin was noticeably cleaner and smoother. Squeaky clean, in fact! I also sometimes get little flesh colored bumps (zits under the skin, I think) under my eyes and the tops of my cheekbones. After using this for a few days, the bumps were gone! My skin looks fresh and clean, feels smoother, and I&#x27;ve actually been getting a lot of compliments on how &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; my skin looks. Also, I have sensitive skin that tends to break out with a lot of products, but this gives me a deep clean that doesn&#x27;t break me out! yay!</li>
    <li> Well, I always try to find an effective facial cleanser product, so this one is OK to have. It really does not have any strong smell. It has a mini rubber scrubber attached with which you can clean your face, supposedly it cleans the pores better. I am not sure how effective it really is. It does not remove the eye make up. I have to clean my eyes separately with the eye make up remover.</li>
    <li> Love the brush scrubber the product itself makes my face too oily</li>
    <li> This little doohikey that comes with the cleanser is great! its soft made of silicone i guess, but it  fits nicely between your fingers so you can&#x27;t really push too hard, and it also slips back into the bottle so you&#x27;re not trying to find a clean and dry place to hold it. I love it, very convenient and does a good  job of gently exfoliating your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a face brush person, but after having trouble finding a suitable one I tried this.  Now I&#x27;m in love with the silicone scrubber.  Doesn&#x27;t feel harsh at all, but leaves your face and neck feeling smooth, smooth, smooth!</li>
    <li> It really feels good on your skin, cleanses as it should. It doesn&#x27;t take much, therefore will last for while</li>
    <li> Summed up, it does NOT deep clean. Not at all. I like the scrublet, I think it&#x27;s an alright product for someone with normal skin but it&#x27;s definitely not for clearing away blackheads or clogged pores of any sort. I don&#x27;t like it for that reason alone. It didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but my blackheads actually got worse using this product. I do not recommend for any other skin types besides normal with very, very slight acne or none at all.</li>
    <li> Washing my face with L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 Clean, Deep Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin works great for me, I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very silky and  keeps your face really smooth. I love it and it smells nice. I would suggest you get it because loreal is always a nice product.</li>
    <li> Best face wash ever. Buy it!!</li>
    <li> I love the way this product leaves my face so soft and clean .</li>
    <li> Really, really love it!  It feels great, almost no smell and cleans very well.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found to clean my face and make-up, and the scrublet it&#x27;s very good!!</li>
    <li> Disappointed to find that the &amp;#34;deep facial cleanser&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t clean nor help with preventing acne. It didn&#x27;t seem to help remove blackhead either.</li>
    <li> Seems like the description of product is right on about being for sensitive skin, price was right too ,  and from a great company, would buy again, i think i&#x27;m going to actually stick with this brand / item moving forward i&#x27;ve been using what cvs or walmart carried in the past,  there more expensive and i never felt truely comfortable using the cvs store brand ,  for my face..  I&#x27;d recommend , i&#x27;m a guy so can only speak for myself.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin. Deep cleans and softens skin.</li>
    <li> This really dried out my skin. After 2 hours of using this my skin break out. I had 4 or 5 new pimples. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Gentle, effective, and makes my skin feel, soft, clean, and refreshed.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser! I bought another one but I think to go back to this one. It&#x27;s nice and gentle. Skin is very smooth after using this cleanser. I was surprised and recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash and I thought it would be very convenient to order it off of Amazon instead of going to the store to buy it! So I ordered it, and when it got here the face wash was gushed open and all over the package. The US Postal Service had to wrap it in plastic so it didn&#x27;t go everywhere. I&#x27;m very disappointed and I hope that I can get new ones in return. The two I have right now are useless. It sucks!</li>
    <li> this product isn&#x27;t harsh for me at least, everyone has different skin. i have sensitive skin that will dry out quickly, however i&#x27;m not prone to break outs. although i&#x27;m not prone to break outs it&#x27;s good to wash your face and this doesn&#x27;t dry my face out. I also used the 360 clean original kind ( its pink instead of blue ) that had a tingle to it and didn&#x27;t bother me my skin but was a lil harsher. i LOVE the rubber sponge thing that comes with it so you don&#x27;t have to use your fingers. it&#x27;s better to unclog your pores than using your hands to wash your face. i cant think of any negatives so i gave it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> Love this for several reasons...&lt;br /&gt;- When I&#x27;m done, I feel my face really does feel clean.  It has an almost minty feel, then when you hit it with toner - WOW!  Will wake you right up.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t take much to use.&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;scrublet\\&quot; feels like it&#x27;s really helping the cleanser do its job; it rinses clean in seconds; it attaches to the bottle, so you always have the cleaner and scrublet together; PLUS you get a brand new one every time you get a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change about the product is:&lt;br /&gt;- The bottles aren&#x27;t clear as to what cleaner should be used on what kind of skin.&lt;br /&gt;- It should come in a body wash!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s about time someone invented a legitimate, different way to wash your face. This would be a gimmicky throwaway if it didn&#x27;t work ...but it does. This product is very nice. My face feels great after using it, not dried out. The glycerin (definitely in it) and the salycylic acid (perhaps not) are both under control.    My bottle of this stuff and the scrubby are baby blue, not pink</li>
    <li> Great product for a very good price. It does make the skin dry so make sure to use a moisturizer. I can recommend it using only once per day (either in the morning or at night). I heard that it&#x27;s good to control acne as well though It&#x27;s too early for me to tell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall great product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 26 and started getting whiteheads on and around my nose in my early teens. Sometimes they were huge, sometimes they were tiny, but there was always a continual supply of new ones forming. My old facial scrubs never really did much and I had so much trouble not picking at them which left me with awful red marks that lasted days. The scrublet is AMAZING -- it&#x27;s perfect for massaging the fleshy bits of my nose (whitehead central) and also the area of my chin where I&#x27;d get huge and long lasting zits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use this every three days or so (I think the gentle nature of the cleanser allows my skin to keep itself healthy)&lt;br /&gt;1) my pores all over my face are TINY now&lt;br /&gt;2) the skin on my chin is perfect and smooth&lt;br /&gt;3) I have ZERO WHITEHEADS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have whiteheads and hate them seriously try this product out</li>
    <li> Love this face wash! I bought it because I had a bad rash on my face from using a friends clean and clear face wash that was just too strong for my skin. I bought this and my face got really soft and the rash went away in two days. I still use it the scrubber is great at removing foundation and eyeliner for the days that I wear makeup. Will repurchase its kind of hard to find though!</li>
    <li> So easy to get a clean face and it lasts FOREVER as you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash but Target doesn&#x27;t sell it and I refuse to shop at Wal-Mart anymore. Price is good on amazon and I had no problems receiving it so no complaints. The little scrubber inside is pretty cool.</li>
    <li> This product offers deep cleaning. The size is generous and last pretty long. I have not used the scrubber yet.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is the cleanser for you.  It is gentle, non drying, no fragrance, and removes all traces of makeup.  It is the only one I have found that works.</li>
    <li> It was cheaper and easier to buy from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your face feel clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this cleanser.</li>
    <li> This gentle cleanser helps me keep my skin healthy without scrubbing it raw. The bottle design is innovative. The blue dot pops out to be a soft scrubber. I like this.</li>
    <li> I prefer to use all natural products because of toxicity, but this wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be after I looked up the ingredients.  I actually bought it for the rubber scrubby that comes with it, and it works great!  The whole thing cost less than the rubber scrubby from Sephora and works as well, I suspect.  Unfortunately, this is no longer available on Subscribe &amp; Save unless they changed it back.  It was a great deal when it was on S&amp;S.  I guess I&#x27;m lucky I got it when I did.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash, gentle on my sensitive skin. Love the little scrubby brush with it too, great for a deeper clean without irritating skin.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have a smell. It has a gross smell...like iron or something not pleasant. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean my face well. I often have to use it twice to get all the makeup and daily dirt off my face (and I don&#x27;t have a particularly dirty or makeup-caked face). I previously had the Grapefruit version of this L&#x27;Oreal 360 cleaner and LOVED it. That one worked so much better, smelled good, and made my face feel fresh, not just rinsed like this &amp;#34;flavor.&amp;#34; Definitely buy L&#x27;Oreal 360 cleaner, just not this one...unless you absolutely must have the blue scrubber</li>
    <li> I have extrememly sensitive skin and this is the first drug store based cleanser that makes my face feel good. And the price is far more reasonable than the top line cosmetic products and works just as well.</li>
    <li> Love this face wash. About the same price as store and the same quality. Great for sensitive skin. Creates lots of foamy bubbles which lets me know it&#x27;s cleaning well.</li>
    <li> Great idea, but the nubby pad is rubbery, and then you put slippery soap on it, and then try to rub it on your face.  So you&#x27;re trying to hold on to a slippery rubbery wet thing and not get soap in your eyes - which is a pain in the butt.  It doesn&#x27;t really exfoliate very well if you have super-dry skin.  The &amp;#34;Deep&amp;#34; part of &amp;#34;Deep Facial Cleanser&amp;#34; is a really big stretch.  Also, doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
    <li> Feels good on skin but dont feel like its doing anything</li>
    <li> My teenage niece introduced me to this product. Best face wash. Effectively removes makeup (especially eye liner and mascara) and daily grim. Leaves my decades-old face feeling ultra clean. Does not dry out my skin. Leaves it glowing. A small dab goes a long way. I have paid more for like-products, but none has worked as well. A product that works well for multi-generations deserves more advertising. I pray Loreal never discontinues this skin care gem.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few months now. This really help my skin and the little scrubber thing tickles my face. I don&#x27;t have to use much of this and it takes takes my make up off real well I use a rag with it. It really doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent to it.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have purchased this face wash, and I really like it!  It doesn&#x27;t really smell, its not heavy, doesn&#x27;t leave my face greasy and the rubber/plastic scrubber thing is a really nice feature!  I really feel like I&#x27;m getting deep down into the pores and giving my face a deep down clean!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s hard to find this in some stores such as Walgreens and CVS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very combination sensitive skin.  Tried many different kinds of cleansers over the years, especially when my face gets over-sensitive during the winter.  Last winter was terrible!  I had to go to a dermatologist for special treatment.  Once I was trying to get back to normal I ran into the trouble with finding stuff that doesn&#x27;t wash well enough leaving my face feeling still oily, leaving it too dry, or adding too much moisture where I break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this does NOT include SALICYLIC ACID nor BENZOYL PEROXIDE.  I use this twice a day along with benzoyl peroxide cream only on zits and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin during the day.  I quit using the scrubby brush mainly because I don&#x27;t want to over scrub my face.  If you want simple, get this!  Clears my face up after about a week.  Hope this works for you!</li>
    <li> This cleanser works as well, if not better at removing makeup at the end of the day as my Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder cleanser that cost 3 times as much.  This sensitive skin formula cleans without irritating my skin, and doesn&#x27;t overly dry it out.  I also love the little scrubber that is on board as well.  It really makes your skin feel very clean, and invigorated after using.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. and the additional rubber pad for cleaning the face is awesome.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is all that is says and more. Firstly I LOVE the little soft scrub disk, I didn&#x27;t think I would, but I do. It is very gentle but the little scrubbers do their job well without being overly abrasive. The actual cleanser is great, very gentle, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dry, my skin isn’t red or agitated afterwards. I am left with soft, clean, fresh feeling skin, and a little rinse of the scrub disk I’m done. I do only use this once a week, but it stops the buildup, reduces black heads, and keeps my face feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive and mostly dry skin and eczema on my face (my T-zone). Because of the cream that I use to treat my eczema I get buildup in my pores and black heads.</li>
    <li> my local walmart no longer carries this item so I am happy to be able to still purchase on Amazon. I use to use expensive brands of face cleaner until I discovered this works the same for way less then half the price. Would definitely recommend this face cleaner. Leaves your face feeling clean and not greasy</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this cleanser was drying my oily skin too much... Will give it one more try in summer time. But the brush is really great!</li>
    <li> Okay, so... it smells like glue. And i am not even sugar coating. it smells exactly like elmers glue!! The scrubber works extremely well and i have used these face washes before (just never this one) and i do not recommend this to anyone. I didn&#x27;t find this helpful at all for my sensitive skin either.</li>
    <li> I really liked it until I found out that it was bad for the environment.</li>
    <li> I love it. Great size, easy to apply. Only paid $ 4.25 on Amazon. It&#x27;s for every day use. Feels clean, refreshment and beautiful soft skin. I highly recommend this product. Forget about bad reviews.</li>
    <li> I had never used this product before in my life-time even though I have purchased Loreal Products in the past 20 years. I did not know if this was a horrible product that would break out my sensitive skin; however, I decided to take a chance and/or give it a try. I was shocked that Loreal makes such a great product for my skin. It worked completely! I would buy this product again and again in the future. I like it very much!</li>
    <li> Lucky to find this product. I love the scrubber as it makes the whole process a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Say no to soap and use this instead</li>
    <li> I have the cleanser for sensitive skin.  I must say-- it cleans my face really well.  I&#x27;m a 30 year old woman and I was suffering from horrible acne and bumpy skin due to hormonal medications.  My skin has gotten back to normal.  No more new breakouts.  It&#x27;s gentle and effective.  Not abrasive.  I&#x27;m not sure how effective the little scrublet is, but the cleanser works.  Love it.  Oh, might I add that I also follow up with an astringent for sensitive skin as well and then I finish it off with light moisturizer.  So far, so good!  :)</li>
    <li> This face-wash is very gentle and does a good job of removing makeup.  I don&#x27;t really care for the &amp;#34;face scrublet&amp;#34; it comes with - I just use my fingertips to get a nice lather going before wash my face.</li>
    <li> Not happy. First dried my skin, a couple of days later-acne. This review for deep facial cleanser for sensitive skin.  My skin is dry and sensitive. Only plus-does not contain parabens...</li>
    <li> This product is great. It takes all the dirt off my face and leaves it smooth. I love the removable scrub because its so easy to use and easy to put back.</li>
    <li> I like the little scrublet alot. Works well with the cleanser.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser.  It makes my face feel really clean and smooth.  Works really well on sensitive skin.  No irritation or breakouts.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an ingenious, little, rubber scrubber that pops perfectly into the center of the bottle.  Wonderful for sensitive skin, but scrubby enough to get your face feeling super clean.  AND it has a little suction cup on the back!  So when you&#x27;ve finished scrubbing your face into a bubbly lather, you can just reach out and stick it to the shower wall or sink edge and it&#x27;ll just wait happily until you&#x27;ve washed the soap out of your eyes and can return it to it&#x27;s little home in the middle of the bottle!</li>
    <li> LOVE!!! I prefer this product over my very expensive clarasonic!</li>
    <li> I wash my face every other day and is been perfect for my skin even my husband use it.</li>
    <li> cleans my face but has done nothing for my pores and has actually made my acne harder to get rid of.</li>
    <li> I bought this cleanser in a pinch at a local CVS about six months ago while I was travelling (I had run out of my usual while on the road). Given the pricetag I didn&#x27;t have high expectations...boy was I surprised. I fell in love with this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry skin, sensitive skin or even acne prone skin (that gets dried out from acne products), this is a great cleanser at a great price.  The cleanser leaves your skin feeling clean but also moisturized. Clean but not dry. Clean but not oily. It just cleans great and leaves skin feeling good. While I haven&#x27;t tried the other two versions of the cleanser I would say this one is not only great for sensitive skin but for many skin types. I recently purchased the acne prone skin version and I will post my review once I have tried it for several weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sensitive skin version has a similar look and feel to cetaphil. Its white and creamy as it comes out the bottle but dare I say I think it removes makeup more effectively than Cetaphil. While Cetaphil is great (I love the moisturizer), Cetaphil cleanser is not good at taking off makeup. This L&#x27;Oreal formulation looks very similar to Cetaphil in your hand and it is equally non drying. However, the L&#x27;oreal formulation leaves my skin feeling cleaner and rinses easier from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the scrublet L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 comes with. I normally use my clarisonic but I also normally only use it at night (after I have been wearing makeup all day). The scrublet is great to use in the morning or if you dont have a clarisonic. It is also great for travel having the scrublet attached to the bottle. The scrublet really takes the extra step to remove dirt and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed since I fell in love with this cleanser it has become harder to find and my local drugstore is always sold out. So I have started buying it on Amazon. And its only $4-$5!! What a steal!!For more reviews check out pimples and wrinkles online.</li>
    <li> This face cleanser is great for sensitive skin. I have have tried many cleansers in the past from expensive to cheap and this one is still one of my favorites. The little scrubber that it comes with is a great little bonus.</li>
    <li> I got this product from a store and I choose this one out of the many options because it had such high reviews here on amazon. I don&#x27;t have a ton of pimples or black heads but enough that I was looking for a new facial cleaner to help clear me up a bit more. The first couple of weeks I used this cleaner I broke out terribly bad. Then I read online that over exfoliation can cause worse break outs. I cut back on using the scrubber thingy and I went back to the way my skin was before using this product. Does it do what it claims? Does it &amp;#34;deeply cleans skin and unclogs-pore by pore- with out over drying&amp;#34; my simple answer no. Does it &amp;#34;remove all traces of dirt and oil and make up?&amp;#34; No. Does it make pores &amp;#34;look visibly smaller&amp;#34; no. This cleanser leaves a weird oily substance on my face after I&#x27;m done rising it. It has made my skin a lot more oily naturally which means its over drying it. I dried my face with a white towel yesterday after washing my face with it and was amazed that tan makeup was on the towel AFTER washing my face!!! I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this if I were you. I know I won&#x27;t ever buy it again!</li>
    <li> this make be breakout so bad!! i have senstive skin so i thought it would help but it made me look like i had a big rash on my face!!might work for some but not me!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use the scrubber pad, but the cleanser is gentle.</li>
    <li> Dissappointed.  My face did not feel really cleansed after using this product.  The scrubber helped a little, but only where I used it</li>
    <li> This leaves a nice clean feel to the skin, but it seems to be clogging the pores, which is not a good thing.</li>
    <li> I love the scrublet. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m getting a deep clean with a gentle cleanser. I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Go 360 cleansers with the built-in scrublet for several years and tried several versions - the blue, orange, and green ones. I like that they can remove my eye make-up (even waterproof mascara). I&#x27;ve stocked up on these because the store I used to purchase them from stopped carrying this item in this version (for sensitive skin). This version really does work well for sensitive skin that experiences random breakouts.</li>
    <li> Really like this face wash.  Love the scrubby that is attached to the bottle- how convenient!  Left my skin feeling very smooth and clean. I originally decided to try this face wash after reading about how terrible micro beads are for the environment.  The scrubby solves that issue-  you can just recycle the whole bottle when you&#x27;re finished! It did dry my skin a bit and is only ok at removing make up.</li>
    <li> Received product as described by seller with no problems, will buy again in future.</li>
    <li> It works realty good.</li>
    <li> Reasonably priced and works for my very sensitive skin.  The little sponge is gentle and easy to use.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the one for sensitive skin, because the ones with the pink scrubber makes your face feels really cold and stimulates your face and I hate that. Do not buy that if you dont like it either.</li>
    <li> I like it - it is very gentle on my sensitive skin. Very happy with this product. I received this product at a discounted price through Amazon for an honest review</li>
    <li> I am loving this face wash!  I have acne prone skin and I have a really hard time finding a face wash that doesn&#x27;t break me out and also doesn&#x27;t cause super dry skin.  This is so mild and feels fantastic when using the Scrublet. It is not so scrubby that it hurts. I lightly use a circular motion to scrub my face.  I saw a review about it being too strongly scented so I was worried about that, but I don&#x27;t smell a thing.  It just has that typical unscented scent if that makes sense.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing; it&#x27;s been the only product that I&#x27;ve ever been able to put on my skin that doesn&#x27;t eventually make me break out more. My only problem is that, even though this is for sensitive skin, my skin is extremely sensitive so after about 2 weeks it did start to dry my face out a bit. To relieve some of that I began rinsing my face with cold water after washing it with the product, but it still gets dry. I have yet to find a moisturizer that will relieve my skin from drying out without making me break out horribly, but that&#x27;s another story. As far as this product goes for cleansing, it is very very good and I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I have used the sensitive skin variety for several months now and I have to say I really like this product.  The cleanser by itself is decent and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but the scrubber is the hard worker here.  I love it.  In fact, I love it so much that when I ran out of the cleanser (and couldn&#x27;t find any in the store), I used it with my other facial cleansers.  So even if you don&#x27;t love the soap, it&#x27;s worth the purchase for the scrubber!</li>
    <li> I like the cleanser for sensitive skin AND the scrublet. They clean well without any problems as long as you remember it&#x27;s your face and don&#x27;t get scrub happy like you&#x27;re scrubbing a pot or pan. The only other concern is there is a wide range of pricing ranging from $4.97 at local stores without coupons to people charging $10+ for it. Shop around...it&#x27;s good and the scrublet is cute but not worth getting ripped off!</li>
    <li> (on my husband&#x27;s account)...I never broke out until after I had my son. For the past year and a half, I&#x27;ve been trying to clear it up. I had tried EVERYTHING!!! I didn&#x27;t have really bad acne, just a lot of excess oil, white &amp; black heads that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of. I bought this just as a night cleanser to get clean off my makeup, but then realized it had a scrublet with it and figured I&#x27;d try it out. It worked WONDERS. I rinsed off my face and was amazed just by one wash. The name really fits how it makes your face feel: CLEAN! I use it once a day, sometimes every other day, because it can be drying. I put moisturizer on afterwards to hydrate my face. I&#x27;m so ecstatic about this face wash! I&#x27;m going to buy every wash on the Go 360 Clean line.</li>
    <li> My face is very sensitive and prone to over drying.  I love this face wash because it doesn&#x27;t sting or dry out my face.  And the rubber scrubber feels great!</li>
    <li> This cleanser has a very light scent, barely noticeable. However, it irritated my face (combination, sensitive skin) so I&#x27;ve had to pretty much use it as a chest and back wash. For the price, it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Good face wash! I like this face wash but it really drys out my sensitive skin. It made my skin tight feeling as well, which is why I left only 3 stars. Lathers nicely and leaves your skin feeling clean. It&#x27;s affordable and makes my skin feel clean, but definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me. I like the idea of the scrubber brush.</li>
    <li> It is gentle enough it wont cause irritation or pre peel but the scrublet is cleansing enough to remove dead skin.</li>
    <li> good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good good</li>
    <li> This is great at removing makeup.  Its the only thing that will get my mascara off.  My face feels clean after too. Just dont get it in your mouth, cuz its pretty bitter.</li>
    <li> shipped really fast cant wait to try it</li>
    <li> Very good product,takes off all the make-up. Will purchase this product again. No fragrance, slightly lathers, gente, not harsh, did not feel that i dried out my skin at all.</li>
    <li> Works like the best ever</li>
    <li> I use this as an all over body wash as well as face wash.  It&#x27;s very gentle and leaves your skin feeling good.</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash just to try something new.. I LOVE IT. It leaves your face feeling clean, and I noticed the size of my pores were much smaller! After I used this I ordered 2 more bottle for my sister&#x27;s.. they love it as well.</li>
    <li> I use the deep cleansing one, my son the sensitive skin. The little silicone scrubber that comes with it is great, applies the product without irritating your skin. At first I didn&#x27;t think it was really scrubbing my face, but was amazed. It leaves your face clean and soft. My son&#x27;s skin is sensitive to the point that any cleanser used in the past leave his face bright red and irritated, the 360 clean doesn&#x27;t. I had tried many items for him that were supposedly for sensitive skin without success, I&#x27;m glad that one finally came through. I went from makeup remover wipes that dried out my skin to this and won&#x27;t go back.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a first time user but I&#x27;m impressed. This really cleans my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any break-out. Great facial wash!</li>
    <li> So I started using this and Olay moisturizer - Luminous. and my skin has never been clearer. I am not sure what it is - either the moisture or this, but after trying a bunch of items, this is great for the low price! And it&#x27;s kind of fun with the scruby thingy!</li>
    <li> My favorite cleanser. Hard to find in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> Made my sensitive skin sting sometimes and caused some redness, even without using the little scrubber. Only pro - it did cleanse well and didn&#x27;t seem to leave any residue behind.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have sensitive skin, have not had any problems. Makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
    <li> I love this - the little face scrubber makes me feel like I really get my face clean but the product doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.  Definitely recommended.</li>
