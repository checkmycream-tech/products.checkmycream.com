<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had no idea that Wen was on Amazon or I would have switched over sooner for supplies.&lt;br /&gt;I am appalled and I hate to guess how many people they must have scammed with their fraudulent advertising practices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I registered last February and ordered the cleanser and a spray for $60.00 approx. What I received was a large box with a collection of products that I did not order and I would never use such as anti-frizz for my short straight hair! The whole package was charged for about three times my initial purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called and told Wen there was a mistake but they denied it and claimed that I had committed myself online to purchase this package when I registered. I was sure I had not as I always keep a hard copy of online orders.&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered when I returned to the Website as a potential purchaser is that, buried in the 3 pages of dense verbiage that one has to accept for the purchase to go through, was a few lines stating that first time buyers would be mailed a full range of product for trial in addition to what was being ordered. This is the old worn out trick of hiding scams in endless pages of fine print that no one ever read because it would take far too long and besides, the language used is \\&quot;Legalese\\&quot; meaning incomprehensible to most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refused to pay for the unwanted items and I contacted my credit card about the fraud, Wen would not get a cent extra. They threatened some sort of action but being a senior paralegal, I called their bluff.&lt;br /&gt;I said that I was going to return the unopened products, they said they did not want it, I sent it back anyway with proof of mailing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice I spoke with a Wen supervisor and explained the situation. Both, in turn, agreed to cancel the alleged unpaid amount and start my account afresh, but it never happened. On both occasions, after I had placed a repeat order, I never received it and when I called, the CSA said that I had an unpaid balance so my order had beencancelled.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very sorry situation where a probably decent hairdresser placed his excellent product in the hands of a crooked or incompetent (or both) alleged corporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, the product(s) is excellent and I will fight to keep buying it, even if I have to use Amazon and lose on the member&#x27;s preferred prices that I qualify for.&lt;br /&gt;I was so incensed that I was ready to escalate the dispute to a legal action, but in the end, Amazon is an easier and more trustworthy alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAME ON WEN &#x3D; Let&#x27;s kill it on Facebook et al.&lt;br /&gt;CHAZ DEAN &#x3D; Retrieve your products and start again - Honestly this time.</li>
    <li> The Wen hair care product is great for my curly hair and makes my hair so soft when I straighten it. Love it.</li>
    <li> The wife was really pleased ;-)</li>
    <li> I do not like this product it just didn&#x27;t work for me but my daughter loves it. My hair started feeling and looking dirty one day after I would wash it and it did not have any body and was even more flat. Nothing claimed in the commercials happened for me. I just didn&#x27;t like it but my daughter and her friend love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product from their website during a promotion special about three months ago for my mother. To my surprise, I was charged with another order just a few days ago (this time for about twice as much as the last order for the SAME product). Apparently I had signed up for a &#x27;continuity order&#x27; which is what I was told when I called to try and cancel the order. Unfortunately, the order had already processed (they email you after they send out the product because who needs to know before the product is already sent out right?) so the only way to get my money back is with the 60 day guarantee, which I plan on taking full advantage of. I didn&#x27;t even bother to ask my mother how she liked the product before typing up this review because I do not appreciate shady business practices. My advice is to read the fine print when dealing with WEN, if you can find it.</li>
    <li> Wow sounds like theirs a law suit against Chaz Dean and his Wen products currently happening.. Women are suing because it&#x27;s causing them to lose their hair.  So beware everyone............I&#x27;m glad I threw it away after the first time I used it.  It was awful but at least I stopped before I lost my hair.</li>
    <li> Best hair care products out there!</li>
    <li> The wen products work great for my fiancé</li>
    <li> Def did NOT live up to my expectations. I almost wish that I would&#x27;ve ordered via paid programming... At least then I would have been able to get my money back.</li>
    <li> Love this product! I have very long thick hair.  Wen saves me time in the shower and the end result is silky smooth. Sometimes it&#x27;s difficult to rinse out completely, that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The product is awesome.  Hate they won&#x27;t let you order the specific item you want.  I only want the Cleansing Conditioner.  Signed up for it, and they bombarded me with too much product.  I got my order back in 2011, and have now just finally used all the Cleansing Conditioner, but threw away all the other products they made me receive and pay for.  They don&#x27;t seem to be needed by me.  Tried ordering on the Website and still you have to get all the different products, not just what you specifically want.  Called, and same problem.</li>
    <li> The company Go-To-Girl from Las Vegas, Nevada is where I placed my order of $61 and change. All I received as a very small nylon bag with packaging inside - No Product!!!! Time for the return process and to make sure I get what I order / pay for I&#x27;ll just go through WEN&#x27;s site. Gotta have it for Christmas for my daughter : -)  First time ordering Go-To-Girl and the last time.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and really gave this product a serious try out, but it left my hair looking like a massive grease ball.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift, and the person that received it likes the product. BEWARE when you order this product by this company on line. The purchaser  is automatically put into a contract to receive this product monthly!! When I noticed another charge on my charge card I notified my card company. Together , we are trying to get my money refunded. Chaz Dean claims that they have already shipped a 9  month supply and that I can return the product and will be refunded the product price only sticking me with a hefty shipping and handling cost. With my card company on the line with me, I have canceled all future shipments and have learned a hard lesson to always read the fine print when ordering. I will see if they will indeed come through with this obligation on their part. I feel that the business practices of this company is horrid! so far I was promised an e-mail confirmation of this cancellation and have not received it as yet, and was now told the confirmation might not get to me for three more days. ugh!</li>
    <li> Great product. Bad billing practices.  They tease you will a very low price for the starter kit.  Then get you on recurring billing.  I was under the impression that I was paying the same price for my starter kit as the next shipment, but it was 3x the cost!  I don&#x27;t remember seeing that anywhere on the sign up page! I&#x27;m disputing with my bank.</li>
    <li> Do not buy Wen products and especially DO NOT BUY THEM FROM THEIR ADS!  Their ads lie and their guarantee is tough to get back.  The product is not that great - just use your moisturizer as shampoo that is what Wen is... moisturizer works better, is cheaper and you won&#x27;t have to deal with the scam tactics that the company uses &amp; keeps billing even though you call to cancel.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo doesn&#x27;t foam - it is just like conditioner.  (The shampoo directions say to us 10 to 15 pumps of the product - that&#x27;s alot!!!)&lt;br /&gt;The customer service person basically called me a liar.  She told me I hadn&#x27;t called to cancel.  Oh, but I did!&lt;br /&gt;DO try the Cindy Crawford Meaningful Beauty Moisturizer product - Creme de Serum - my older skin is amazingly soft &amp; smooth now, &amp; that company does do what they say.  Their products work!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY WEN - I have a feeling I will have a fight to get my money refunded.  You know they are a scam when you call &amp; their customer service people don&#x27;t care and are rude.  They basically just tell you to return it - what happened to the money back guarantee and they are sorry you don&#x27;t like the product?  AND, she asked if I had any negative effects like hair falling out!!!!  Yikes - why would they ask that if it hadn&#x27;t been a problem????  HMMMM....&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware of WEN!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice. The first time, my hair certainly didn&#x27;t feel clean afterward and it definitely didn&#x27;t stay clean. I usually wash my hair twice a week, no problem. It&#x27;s Wednesday, and I&#x27;ll be washing tonght for the third time this week. I&#x27;m so disappointed because the commercials make it look so great. Sad deal, not worth it.</li>
    <li> So far I don&#x27;t see a difference in my hair. In fact it seems thinner. However, my husband loves it</li>
    <li> Yes all the products from Chaz I received have been opened and used. I especially like the intensive hair cream</li>
    <li> I tried the product and found that it really didn&#x27;t make much difference than my regular shampoo.  Really not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I started to use Wen  in April of 2012. I did so because I noticed that I was loosing a lot of hair strands, even my hair dresser was concerned. I saw an info commercial on Wen. I went ahead and tried it and have noticed that my hair is improving. I am also taking BIOTIN a supplement for hair and nails. But overall the WEN products have definately improved my hair and its texture. Thank you. Ms. Erlinda</li>
    <li> I noticed with the first use that my hair was so easy to comb through after washing.  No tangles or pulling.  It takes some time to get used to a lather free wash.  My hair feels soft and clean and is manageable.  I used the cleansing conditioner while on vacation where the water was not softened and was not pleased.  My hair did not feel clean.  At home, where my water is soft, it cleans my hair fine.</li>
    <li> purchased these for 4 women at Christmas time.  I saw the commercials on tv and thought they would be good.  Every one of them liked the product and then I ordered one more for one lady&#x27;s birthday.</li>
    <li> I bought the 30 day shampoo and conditioner several years ago. Made my hair greasy and products built up in my hair. I had shoulder length medium thickness fine hair and didn&#x27;t it last 20 days let alone 30. If I used less product not enough in hair. Don&#x27;t understand this product. They also sent me another box 30 days later although I didn&#x27;t sign up for continuing service, had to wait on the phone a long time for customer service to send back. I dropped it off at the post office to wait a long time for refund. To me it&#x27;s a scam. If you want to try it do it on amazon not on there site. To me now at age 58 I use Andalou hair products which are more natural and help with gray frizzies much cheaper too from vitacost.com</li>
    <li> I signed up for auto delivery with a 5 month interval believing it would be a one time charge of $24.95 + shipping &amp; handling for each shipment.  My first shipment arrived and I was charged $32.94 however 28 days later my credit card was charged $24.95. I contacted Wen customer service and was told I would be charged an additional $24.95 for the products I received.  The customer service rep was not willing to work with me to settle this matter so at the end of our conversation I canceled my membership with this establishment. Unfortunate because I did like the product but I&#x27;m sure I will find something just as good if not better.</li>
    <li> I I&#x27;m a hair stylist for 30 years, my hair was in bad shape and needed some TLC. I was tried of the everyday shampoo. So I won&#x27;t to something new. I love it. It has really change my hair. It&#x27;s growing and fill great.  Ginger</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there was NO shampoo in this package. So I &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; my hair with conditioner for a week before I figured it out!! I wonder what the shampoo would of done!!</li>
    <li> I would not give this product ANY stars. You might as well wash your hair with mayonnaise. First, the instructions tell you to use cold water, who showers in COLD water? My hair felt gross after using this product. I tried one more time with no improvement, called and cancelled any future orders. The person on the phone tried to guilt me into buying more by saying how they are losing money by selling the hair care kit for such a low price. I replied this was their problem not mine. In addition, on their website was an offer for some kind of &#x27;free&#x27; vitamins to try. I did order that, was billed $90 for &#x27;free&#x27; vitamins. In addition, about a month later, I got another box of vitamins. I didn&#x27;t open them (I recognized the return address), called the company and asked &#x27;what&#x27;s this about?&#x27; I was told in accepting the &#x27;free&#x27; vitamins, I had agreed to a shipment every month. I disagreed, returned the package unopened, contacted my credit card company and got my money back. Oh, yeah, as I was trying to cancel these vitamins the person on the phone was trying to give me the &#x27;hard sell&#x27; of how wonderful these (imho worthless) vitamins were. I would never do business with these people again.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised that the order arrived earlier than expected. But I was quite surprised to see a receipt with a credit card number on it thanking me for my order directly from Wen. I purposely ordered from Amazon so that I would not have to go through when so I contacted the company and expressed my concern they assured me that that was their information not mine even though it was my name. For the product my husband absolutely loved it I thought it was great but not worth the cost and will probably go back to my regular shampoo. As usual we could not agree on a product.</li>
    <li> I have seen a lot of infomercials and was skeptical but I am so happy I order WEN. It is an amazing product, easy to use and makes my hear look healthier than ever before, I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try something new. However I noticed after two weeks of using the product that my hair started have excessive breakage. This product caused only damage. I have no positive comments. This is just an expensive product that does nothing. Better results have come from Pantene shampoos and conditioners (just my opinion). Looks like I will have to cut my hair and start over to try and fix what wen damaged.</li>
    <li> First, about the product. I have short and straight hair, but somewhat dry and wiry. It did not cure the situation, but left my hair greasy and heavy. I sent the product to my sister who has long straight, dry and wiry hair. For her, the product did improve her hair, but it was a very subtle improvement, and she did not think it worth buying the product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, about the business practices. They hide it, but when you order the product, you are actually ordering a subscription. They know you will call and complain and try to cancel the subscription, so they&#x27;ve primed the customer service representatives to offer you a discount on the second box of product you didn&#x27;t realize you ordered. They make it very difficult to return the product and cancel the subscription. Even after returning the second box and canceling the subscription, I was billed an additional $89.88. This made for a total of $134.82 worth of mediocre shampoo products in about two months time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very scammy company, I highly recommend that you stay clear of them.</li>
    <li> I have been having lots of issues with my hair these days. I wanted to try Wen because I heard such great things and while I do generally like it, I can&#x27;t justify the expense versus other products out there. I will say the process can be lengthy especially if you use the mask too. The cleanser when left on for the allotted time, makes your scalp feel cool and like it&#x27;s really working but I wouldn&#x27;t say I notice a difference in my hair using it.</li>
    <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and this product makes me cringe! Wen can/will make your hair fall out. Read the reviews all over the internet. It does NOT properly cleanse your hair and scalp causing blockage in hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Would you wash your body with lotion?? No! Stay away from this stuff. It is a gimmick and these people should be ashamed of themselves for scamming people. Stick with hair products that are guaranteed by a licensed professional. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really soft and smells good!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love WEN! I ordered the Lavender scent version and really love it! My hair is extremely soft and shiny! Combing it is easy. I also love that my hair is not weighed down, which can sometimes happen with conditioners. Truly a great product. I did read some reviews complaining about automatic shipments.......I did not have that problem, all you have to do is go to your online acct on the WEN website and change how often you get shipments. You can put 4,6,8,10, etc weeks. I only have shipments set up for every 3 months! You can go as little or as long as you would like! Easy! I also received free gifts when I ordered, which was nice. Customer service was great when I placed my order. No problems so far!</li>
    <li> I will give Wen 0 stars. I have used it for 2 years. My hair is falling out by the hand full every day. It was long and fluffy now it is wild looking and split like crazy. I went to the beauty shop today and in passing she stated if I used Wen that I needed to stop because too much of my hair was falling out. I was shocked that she could tell me the kind of shampoo that I used. Even more shocked that I didn&#x27;t even tie together the length of time using Wen and my hair falling out. Thanks Laurie S. I&#x27;m done with Wen.</li>
    <li> Will order more has done so much for my hair.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me.  It made. My hair very oily.  I have dry hair.</li>
    <li> I buy it for my wife, she just loves this product. She won&#x27;t use any other products on her blonde hair.</li>
    <li> Okay here&#x27;s the deal. I love WEN hair system but the company is a rip off. I have used this product for a little over a year and will continue to use it on my entire families hair. That includes my 2 girls and my husband but I won&#x27;t be purchasing it directly from WEN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First the system has to be used properly. Don&#x27;t use it in the recommended way because your hair will fall out or begin to thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second only use the cleansing conditioner and sixteen conditioner together once a week or your hair will become over conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third don&#x27;t use the cleansing conditioner daily it will break your hair and make it thin or fall out from over conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth if you use the cleansing conditioner, only use one of the other products like the texture balm or anti frizz DON&#x27;T USE BOTH! If you do using more than one product your hair may become hard or frizzy or break or fall out and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifth don&#x27;t mix and match WEN with other products, the end result will be disastrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixth do not use the amount of recommended product use half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have gone through the don&#x27;ts. Lets talk about WEN&#x27;s pricing and business practices. Like I said this is a awesome product when used correctly. However I believe that WEN knowing recommends you use this product in a way that is dangerous and will damage your hair so that they make more money. If you are using the product the way that the company recommends you will run out of product within 3 months if not sooner. Which then WEN will mail you a new shipment automatically. I know your thinking well thats great and the way that it should be. Well your wrong.&lt;br /&gt;Take this into consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st WEN tells you that you will pay 29.99 for the first kit with a membership and then you receive a travel kit plus 2 bottles of cleansing conditioner, 1 bottle of the sixteen sampler. Awesome for the price. They tell you when you receive your second shipment you will receive 3 bottle of cleansing conditioner 1 bottle of sixteen conditioner 1 container of anti frizz (or whatever product you choose) all for the low membership price of 39.99. Wrong that is not true. Yes you will receive those products but no they will not be for the low price of 39.99.&lt;br /&gt;This is how WEN gets you. First you will get a shipment with the items you choose and a charge of 39.99 which they tell you includes the shipping charge. However when you look at the website or the pamphlet they send you it specifically says any purchase over $100 is free, right, wrong. See you think you just paid 39.99 and that is why you had to pay for shipping but that isn&#x27;t true. 28 days after you get charged 39.99 for the shipment WEN will charge you another 29.99 and then 28 days from that charge you will receive another charge for 29.99 and by then it will have been 3 months so it will be time for another shipment so within a couple of weeks you will see another charge for 39.99 and the process will begin again. So you say to yourself where is the membership deal. There isn&#x27;t one. Your paying 99.97 every 3 months for WEN products that you don&#x27;t need. In addition to the fact that in at least one month you will pay twice. If you use the products the way they recommend your hair will be damaged and will thin and break and fallout. If you try to use the products with other products your hair gets worse. Which I think WEN intentionally did to make sure you stick with their line. Not to mention that even if you cancel your order you will still get charged unless you cancel the order before the item is shipped. If not then you are responsible for shipping charges and they will continue to charge you every month unless you call and cancel and make sure they refund the money before its charged. Sounds confusing right but in their system it already has it set up to autocharge so they must go in and refund those auto charges in their system and if you don&#x27;treceive a email confirming the cancellation then your membership is not cancelled and you have no proof that you cancelled it and again you will be responsible for upcoming charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short yes WEN is a great hair product if used wisely and not the way the company recommends. However, unless you are willing to deal with the 99.97 charge over a 3 month period and being charged onto of the charge 39.99 because the scheduled membership mail out overlaps the monthly charge and the possibility that your hair will be damage if you don&#x27;t find a good regimen and it may take up to an additional 3 months to actually cancel your membership then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this product from WEN. Now if the product offer is as a one time fee charge through another company or website then I say go for it. You will just have to play around with the product to figure out whats best for your hair.receive a email confirming the cancellation then your membership is not cancelled and you have no proof that you cancelled it and again you will be responsible for upcoming charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in short yes WEN is a great hair product if used wisely and not the way the company recommends.

    <li> I really wanted WEN to work for a few specific reasons but after about 6 months of use of exclusively using WEN per their directions it has not come close to living up to Mr. Dean&#x27;s claims.  I would love to go to his salon and have him see my hair and hear what he would say!  I&#x27;ve seen Chaz Dean on many programs and followed his advice to the letter!&lt;br /&gt;1.The claim of color lasting has not been true for me.  No difference than regular shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;2. Glossy, lustrous hair, sadly not my experience.  Mine is thin and looks like cotton candy!&lt;br /&gt;3. I was hoping it would strengthen my hair, look thicker and healthy like the models.  No significant improvement.&lt;br /&gt;4. I&#x27;ve tried several of the different conditioners scents and the other special products they recommend, oils, gloss, mousse, re-moist, protector styling cream.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune!&lt;br /&gt;If someone has any suggestions, please let me know.  I love the scents!  Hair feels great when it&#x27;s wet but otherwise, horrible--worse than before!  I&#x27;ve ordered a couple of wigs to wear.  I&#x27;m going to try something new... hoping my hair improves by just using a gentle, salon quality shampoo.</li>
    <li> Save your money, doesn&#x27;t clean your hair, and caused build up if used regularly. Use as a deep conditioner, and work good for that only.</li>
    <li> I thought this would be the &amp;#34;cat&#x27;s meow&amp;#34; but man was I wrong.  My hair has not improved at all in fact it is dull, dryer than it was and really not worth the money I spent on it.  I purchased the Bamboo one.  Maybe some of the others are better but I don&#x27;t want to try any more.  UGH!!!</li>
    <li> I would agree with the other negative comments regarding the billing system for this company. I think it is a great product, however, the website is misleading and yes, I read the fine print. When I made a single purchase, there was an option to join auto-renewal. I specifically avoided this and made a one-time transaction because I wanted to try it out. When my supply was running low, I re-ordered the same way. Just a few days ago, however, I discovered a new charge on my card that I did not authorize. Their customer service dept. INSISTED that I DID join via auto-renewal. After a heated discussion, I convinced them that I WOULD NOT be paying for the s/h for a shipment that I did not order and they cancelled the account, both the first one and the second one generated by my two separate purchases. A new shipment did arrive, and I am waiting on a promised postage paid return label for that one. In the meantime, I discovered today (only 4 days after my previous phone call), that yet another amount was charged to my card and yet another shipment is en route! I informed their customer service dept. that if I did not also receive a return postage paid label for that shipment and full credit for both, that I will follow suit with a report to the FTC and the BBB. Incidentally, I believe this is partly why the Sensa folks are in trouble--for misleading advertising and billing. Caveat Emptor, folks. You just can&#x27;t trust anyone these days, unfortunately.</li>
    <li> This shampoo took some time to get used to, only bc I&#x27;ve been using shampoo nothing like it my whole life. I am definitely making the switch to Wen full time now. My hair feels and looks so much better after using a Wen</li>
    <li> my hair looks  health and fels  light  and  exceptionally  clean  andalive</li>
    <li> Ive only used it once so far &amp; my hair feels good already its different It feels soft &amp; manageable. I am sure after i use it a few more times my hair will feel much better I definitely recommend it to anyone with problem hair</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and other products too but dealing with their \\&quot;customer service\\&quot; is a nightmare. Why they feel they need to force a great product on people is beyond me-all they end up doing is making one close their account but the shampoo and intensive hair treatment is really awesome!!!</li>
    <li> This hair kit, plus a few additional items from Wen, have revolutionized my hair. I naturally have thick, tight curly hair that I love to straighten. However, in the past my hair was always frizzy or would curl at the ends as the day passed. Also, prior to using these products, if I straightened my hair and slept with it over night I would be greasy in the morning and need to wash and style again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since buying this kit (one week of use) my hair is shiny, sleek and frizz has been nearly eliminated. This is my miracle kit, which I never imagined I would say about any product. I was a bit sceptical about how much product they suggest using each wash (16 - 24 pumps) and decided to use only ten pumps each wash and only cleanse every two days (meaning I may shower every day but not use the cleanser each shower).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start by rinsing out my hair for one or two minutes. I spread five pumps of the cleanser; mostly on my roots and scalp first. I put my head under water for two seconds and then continue to massage the cleanser down to the ends of my hair. After two minutes I wash it out and gather five more pumps of the cleanser and repeat the original steps. However, this time I leave it on for the remainder of my shower (five to ten minutes) and wash it out at the end. I use the styling creme before I blow dry and the replenishing spray after I finish flat ironing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair comes out softer and stays straighter. I can work a full day, fall asleep and still wake up with non-greasy, straight hair! I love this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT ONE YEAR LATER (March 25, 2014): I still love this stuff. To be honest, I did go back to regular shampoo to see if there was a difference and I immediately switched back. I don&#x27;t often straighten my hair anymore but it has similar results for curly hair. When I leave my hair curly and down, it dries quicker and has less frizz. I still use the styling creme to curl it and the replenishing spray to set it. My mom, who hasthinner hair was not a fan of the product but I love it for my thick hair.</li>
    <li> Ok...the truth. This is a very good product, but I have to tell you that Sally&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34; is just as good and costs a great deal less...like $12 compared to Wen product.  I found that over time Wen weighed my hair down. It was manageable, but for fine hair, you have to rinse forever!  Also Hair One&#x27;s bottle is larger than Wen so more for your money.</li>
    <li> I Bought only the Cleansing conditioner,I used it twice by itself. I usually wash my hair every other day, but with this it felt very greasy and flat on day two. I decided to use my regluar pantene shampoo and use the Wen as just a conditioner. It works wonderful that way. I don&#x27;t like the way my scalp felt oily with the Wen as both shampoo and conditioner. I wash normally with shampoo and and aply the wen mid shaft to ends. It feels really soft and holds the style and looks shiny and great. Note: Don&#x27;t buy from Wen website, buy from Amazon. They will put you on automatic shipping and charge your card every month. The company is run by Guthy Ranker, which many of you know does Proactiv. They do the same automatic shipping as well. Other than that great conditioner, I may consider other products in the future.</li>
    <li> When you make a purchase of any product or service, I find that it&#x27;s important to make an INFORMED decision. Wen is not difficult to purchase online and you can manage and review everything from your tracking information to the FREQUENCY OF THE SHIPMENTS. Rarely would a company send unsolicited product nor do companies send you product without your consent or your credit card information. It&#x27;s ridiculous to see the number of people who complain about products or services on here who haven&#x27;t bothered to do any research or make an INFORMED decision. That said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered online and changed my shipping frequency right away so I could enjoy my 60 DAY FREE TRIAL without getting another shipment in a month. At first, I thought it made my hair too greasy but I realized I wasn&#x27;t rinsing it good enough. This product is not like regular shampoo. It absolutely cleans your hair better--I have oily hair on the scalp and it&#x27;s dry on the ends and I didn&#x27;t have to wash my hair for two days in a row every time I washed with WEN. The smaller set lasted a full two months (I have shorter hair) and it conditioned my hair very nicely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product probably works best for women who don&#x27;t have super thick hair. I was satisfied. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but because of the way it cleans, it lasts longer. The lavender smells exactly like lavender. WEN-ner for me!</li>
    <li> Had the tendency to make hair greasy and heavy.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo but it just cost to much to keep getting it</li>
    <li> Made my hair frizzy. Didn&#x27;t seem to get enough hydration, even after the reconditioning treatment. My hair still felt a little coarse. My normal shampoo and conditioner worked alot better. The only good thing I have to say about Wen is that I loved the scent.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this stuff.  Have told many friends about Wen and they love it too!. A little different to get used to but well worth it and so much less expensive than purchasing at a salon.  You must try it!</li>
    <li> Helped repair my damaged ends and made it feel like silk when following the directions!  Make sure read all of them before using because you need to leave it on for at least 4 minutes to get full effect.</li>
    <li> Have used this product 3 times already and see ZERO differece. it is said to work the 1st time GUARANTEED.....total lie. I have products that do the same or more and are $10 or less would not recomend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;will be returning product</li>
    <li> Thank Goodness this was a gift and I didn&#x27;t waste my own money. I have used it now 4 times - thinking it would get better. It has only gotten worse. I have a lot of straight long thick hair. I washed my hair this morning before work, styled it and it looked limp, lifeless and dirty.  I had to jump back in the shower and wash it again. Horrible product for my hair type.</li>
    <li> I saw the commercial and was all ready to order Wen this morning---until I read the reviews!  Thank you, everyone who gave their honest feedback.  You saved me some money!  BTW:  Brooke Shields, you should be ashamed for endorsing a company with unprofessional and poor business practices!</li>
    <li> Like many reviewers here who have fine hair you&#x27;ll need to really clean your hair with a more sudsing non-sulfate shampoo.  By the end of the day my bangs started to separate and look flat.  This was a great way to try out some of Chaz Deans products without a reordering commitment.  I use it sometimes as my conditioner on dry ends after using another shampoo.  For my fine hair there is no magic shampoo.  I&#x27;ll continue the search.</li>
    <li> I love this product, however, you must use it correctly. The reviews that say their hair looked dirty and weighed down after using it are probably not using it right. When you apply it, you need to work it into your hair very thoroughly, scratching your scalp and working your hair for several minutes, this is how it gets clean. Then you let it sit for the rest if your shower. Then you rinse very thoroughly, scratching the scalp again to make sure no residue is left. If you do this you will love this product. It makes your hair soooo soft. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome.  I have fine, oily hair which I used to shampoo every other morning with Pureology.  After my shower and before blow drying, I would apply a serum and a root boost....and occasionally a mouse. My head would itch and my hair felt heavy and dry.  One wash with Wen and my hair was alive again.  I was concerned that this may be difficult to rinse out or make my hair feel heavy but it doesnt do either.  It&#x27;s made my hair light shiny and manageable.....and it smells like a dream.</li>
    <li> I am not sure why I got the results I got, but it may have been my hardwater.  Unfortunately this product must not have been tested using hard water.  Normally I use clarifying shampoo to remove residue buildup from the water.  This product seemed like it may have worked with better water.</li>
    <li> I love the Wen Hair care conditioning shampoo. However, the business practices of the company are definitely to scam people. They sent me $90 worth of product I did NOT order when THEY \\&quot;estimated\\&quot; I should be out, which I was not (!) and continued to try to process my credit card, calling me over and over and sending me multiple bills.&lt;br /&gt;I never agreed to auto re-order. When I called them they said that if I had not opened the package, I could have sent it back for a refund. I opened the package because I did not know what it was!&lt;br /&gt;Such a great product. It is a SHAME that this company feels it cannot stand on their quality alone and has to get \\&quot;greedy\\&quot; by forcing orders. I will order mine on Amazon and skip the hassle of dealing with Chaz Dean!</li>
    <li> I adore WEN products! the hydrating mask is superb for deep conditioning; it leaves the hair well conditioned and very manageable. The cleansing conditioner seems to soften and seal the ends of my hair, so that my ends are not left split and dry looking. These products are fantastic, and I would recommend this product to all who are in need of an excellent hair care product. The negative is the cost....quite costly, but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price of the product! I bought this product and I was very disapointed. I did not return it just wasn&#x27;t worth the hassel. I won&#x27;t buy it again. Made my hair feel gross and dirty.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my daughter. It smells really good and she loved it the first 3 or 4 times she used it and then her hair just started looking weighed down. It lost all its shine. She probably wont reorder.</li>
    <li> This product is horrible!!! I ordered the kit and after the first shower I might have seen some improvement but soon realized that if I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair it would look greasy within an hour. I have extremely thick wavy hair. I was really dissapointed that this product did not give me the results it claims on tv. I finished the first bottle with little improvement in my hair. On my second bottle I noticed that I was losing handfulls of hair during every shower. It became so bad that I became concerned for my health and went to the doctor. I had blood work done and my doctor said that everythig came back normal and to try another product on my hair. To give you a visual.... I began to look like a chemo patient. Clumps of hair would just fall out. I called customer service and they were extremely rude and wanted to know my complete medical history and whether or not I had recieved any botox or plastic surgery. The answer to that is no and I was angry that they wanted to verify with my doctor and that is against the law. I asked the customer service guy if this is common and he TOLD me that there have been complaints with hair loss and that some people do not have the right body chemistry to handle the product. Girls this is the worst hair product I have ever used. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> I had ordered a trial of the Lavendar cleansing conditioner a while ago and really liked it.  Then I ordered the styling cream in Sweet Almond Mint and love it.  So, I ordered this kit and I absolutely love it.  I had tried the Renpure cleansing conditioner and hated it.  It left my hair so weighted down and greasy.  It was awful.  Wen has left my hair so soft and my scalp is so clean, not greasy!  I really like the mist spray also.  I haven&#x27;t tried to Re-Moist Intensive treatment yet, but I&#x27;m sure I will love it.  So glad I finally took the plunge and ordered Wen!  Will be ordering larger bottles and other scents when I am finished with this one.</li>
    <li> After less than one bottle, my dry, curly hair is now soft and supple -- like it was as a child. I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on how great my hair smells, too!</li>
    <li> this is amazing. I was initially worried due to other reviews and the menthol in the product. However I am so glad I tried it!!! The cleansing conditioner is AMAZING. My hair is better then ever and I will continue to purchase!! I do shampoo my hair once every 2 weeks to start over again and get a deep clean but I can honestly say the cleansing conditioner does infact leave my hair clean. I also had the itchiest scalp ever and this completely eliminated that problem! My hair and scalp feel amazing from using this product! My hair was dried out from using too much protein and with one wash my hair was back to soft an amazing thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The refresh mist is amazing as well. This small bottle will last forever because such a small amount gives you the desired effect. It leaves my hair super soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep conditioner is great as well. It gives that extra boost. I dont see myself buying the full size of it though because you need to leave it on for like 30 minutes AFTER washing your hair which I do in the shower. So its awkward to get out of the shower  and then jump back in in 30 mins. But if you wash your hair in a sink or whatever I highly recommend the deep conditioner! Its great!&lt;br /&gt;And I love that its cruelty free!! Also if the menthol or any of the ingredients scare you try wen Kids, its allergen free Im gonna buy a few bottles to mix it up with my regular wen.</li>
    <li> Did not like the product, I&#x27;m certain it was not made for my type of hair, made my hair dry. I gave it to my son and it worked better on natural hair.</li>
    <li> I had seen these commercials on tv and was in sure it would work for me but I am never going back to shampoo again it replaced all my products that I was spending a fortune on.</li>
    <li> I like this product as its a starter kits for those who always wanted to try the product. Thus far, the product does as it states. No issues at all.</li>
    <li> This product is good and especially if you have color-treated hair it won&#x27;t strip it. But for the price and all the hype it was a little dissapointing. Like the deep conditioning mask the best. The small spray bottle of reconditioning mist was really unnecessary. &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; products work just as well and cost less.</li>
    <li> I had heard for some time how great this shampoo is, so I finally bought some. I used it for 1 week and gave it to my daughter to try. She has tried it and is also of the same mind set that its not that great.</li>
    <li> This product is great, as a product it works well if you are in and out of the Ocean especially. I love it for travelling. HOWEVER!! The company is terrible and continue to charge my credit card, even tho I only wanted to try it, I have closed my account and STILLL they are charging me!! I am so pissed at their customer service I dont even want to use the product.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try it, get it in a STORE,  DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO!</li>
    <li> I bought the stuff from ads which was bad idea.  Charged me 90 dollars for shampoos that make my hair oily. Nor can you return the products because they will never send a return label.</li>
    <li> I LOVE WEN conditioning shampoo and have been using it now for about 5 months. Once in a while I will shampoo my hair regularly to see if I&#x27;m still loving the WEN.  I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve done it for the last 2 times because I always regret it.  I have very long, highlighted hair that although is relatively thick, curly, and frizzy it is somewhat fine.  It always been difficult to comb out my wet hair after shampooing but with WEN, it glides through!  I really do love this product...it doesn&#x27;t matter which scent, they are all very nice.  I purchase my WEN on QVC.  No dealing with the reorder messes everyone writes about and its actually less expensive to buy the pomegranate and mint together for $40.00.  Sometimes they have other discounts on WEN as well.  The only product in the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; I care about is the conditioning shampoo so that&#x27;s why I buy on QVC because that&#x27;s all I want.</li>
    <li> After using the Wen products for one month, my hair started looking weird, after 3 months, my hair came out in handfuls. The loss is starting to slow down after 1.5 months, but I have lost over 50% of my hair. Not what I hoped for!!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a little hard to get used to washing your hair with a huge handful of what feels like conditioner, but going to keep at it. used the entire system first night, and didn&#x27;t find incredible results, but not bad results. going to give it some more time.</li>
    <li> I bought this kit for my daughter-in-law. She loves it! She was describing how nice her hair is now, with no snarls; looking soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;99% of all shampoos on the market today have harmful fillers in them. Actually that is how they get them to lather up.&lt;br /&gt;They are bad for your hair and cause a lot of damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy the Wen product you will notice it DOES NOT lather up, that is a GOOD thing, that is because it is made of all natural fruits and organic plants.&lt;br /&gt;and leave your hair shinny, silky, soft and squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;These ingredients promote healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;The down side, it is very expensive, but most things that work well are. So I guess it is how you look at it.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I would rather pay a little more and have healthy hair, than to watch it fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Leaves a waxy residue after several uses.</li>
    <li> Im a natural blonde with fine hair...the first week went well...second week i noticed upon waking that my hair was oily...by the third week I noticed that my hair looked and felt much thinner...am back to my old shampoo and hoping to regain some fullness back...am actually nervous about this as i can see my scalp in my part...yikes! Wish Id read reviews first as thinning hair was a common complaint.</li>
    <li> Really refreshing scent. Scalp tingles and feels healthy during&lt;br /&gt;and after treament. Hair is super-soft and easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;The extrsa mini spray provides a nice smoothing of hair 3 days after&lt;br /&gt;the original treatment.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product overall. I noticed the first time I used Wen that it made my hair feel silky smooth wet and dry and it lasted a long time. I started using this when I relaxed my hair and now that I am natural, I continue to use Wen. I also use this on my 4 year old daughters hair.</li>
    <li> I love this hair Product . I use all hair products thank you for the 2 free gifts.! But what I don&#x27;t understand is that I didn&#x27;t get what I ordered and it&#x27;s kind of disappointing . You didn&#x27;t give me the replenishing mist &amp; it says in the description and in your picture instead I got the anti frizz styling cream but I didn&#x27;t need that I already have it . So I&#x27;m a little irritated and disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get everything that I was supposed to get. If that&#x27;s not what your selling ... Then don&#x27;t put it in the discription or in the picture . It&#x27;s called FALSE advertisement :(</li>
    <li> No problems with shipping or packing. The product is awful though. Just feels like you put grease into hair. No real results seen. Not happy with product.</li>
    <li> I have used wen off and on several years, will always have this product on hand. Provides a wonderful feel and the fragrance is gorgeous.</li>
    <li> Wife and daughter loves it!</li>
    <li> I to an VERY upset over the business practices of WEN.  I cancelled my order almost a year ago.  Then out of the blue I get another kit!  I just tried again to cancel this permanently but was told there&#x27;s another kit being sent out. No told then to stop it. She said I could get their fax number and at that point I just said stop it!  The last kit put be into overdrafts to the time of an additional $70!  I&#x27;m so mad. If I get another lot I&#x27;ll blue a gasket!  Be careful people!  Once they have your information they just send these kits out it seems as they feel like.  BEWARE!!!!</li>
    <li> This product is the miracle product it advertise to be. It leaves me hair soft but it doesn&#x27;t really give my hair the shine and the curls it advertise it will give you.</li>
    <li> Loved it everything I was hoping it was very good for the hair and very manageable.  Will certainly purchase it again.  Thank You.</li>
    <li> These conditioner sizes were smaller than I expected but the product is great for dry or frizzy hair.  The mint in this product leaves your scalp stimulated and tingling.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not any better than regular shampoo or conditioner and it&#x27;s almost like a 2 in 1 shampoo like you get at a hotel. It&#x27;s pretty crummy and I have normal hair.</li>
    <li> I only wanted the trial version they advertised on TV for $29.99 which ended up costing me $39.99. I did not like the product and I think it stinks. The next thing I knew, Wen charged my credit card and sent me what they called a 90 day supply. I never asked for this so called 90 day supply nor did I ask them to send any additional products. I am still trying to get my money back minus the shipping and handling charges which I also did not ask for. I feel violated by this company. Don&#x27;t waste your money. On top of everything else, It did not do anything great for my hair.</li>
    <li> I love Wen for my and my daughters hair!! We both have curly hair and this is the best product for us, I&#x27;ve tried TONS of others products but this is the one I am true to!!!</li>
    <li> This product was great the first two weeks, my hair responded well looking clean, bouncy and sat beautiflly even after drip drying. After that, I felt it weighs down hair and does not clean it. I have cancelled and with what is left i use it once a week  as a conditioner and a detangler for my daughters hair.  I have to agree with all the others once you order and give your credit card, they keeps ending and billing without agreement. Very shady business practices.</li>
    <li> Products are all they advertise. I&#x27;ve been tempted for several years and finally bought them. Happy that I did. Thanks</li>
    <li> I am almost 70 years old any my hair becomes very dry no matter what conditioner I use. I find that Wen makes it very easy to comb through after shampoo/conditioner. The only thing I would change is that I want to order shampoo only. I am tired of combs and other products. If I want these items, I would order separately. I feel it&#x27;s a waste of money and product.</li>
    <li> First, the bad. I purchased this from Sephora and paid extra for 3 day shipping--it was for my wife, and a special occasion. It arrived 7 days after the purchase. No one offered shipping refunds, nothing. So if you order this product from Sephora, make sure you have LOTS of time to wait on it. I&#x27;ll never purchase from them again!&lt;br /&gt;Now the good news. My wife LOVES her Chaz Dean!!  She has psoriasis in her scalp, which itches 24 hours a day. Then she saw the infomercial for Chaz Dean. We ordered it and it has not only made her already beautiful hair look magazine-cover beautiful, but the itching has significantly subsided!!  Thanks to Chaz Dean for giving my wife relief from an itching scalp and the most beautiful hair I&#x27;ve ever seen!!  NO thanks to the snails at Sephora. From now on, we will order it directly from Chaz Dean&#x27;s website, autoship, for ony 29.95 a month instead of the 50-something bucks I blew at Sephora.</li>
    <li> It made my hair fluffy and less manageable.  I lost my silky shine that I am used to with my regular hair care products.</li>
    <li> It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena</li>
    <li> So I ordered the 30 trial of the WEN lavender to give it a try. I have long thick hair but and I color my hair so my ends are often dry and crunchy. I tried WEN and I was not very impressed with it moisturizing my hair as it claimed to do, and it did not smell like lavender at all it smelled more like Icy Hot. I even would put some in my hair after my shower as a leave in conditioner as it said you can do. Also the bottle did NOT last for 30 days. It only lasted about 2 1/2 weeks and for something that needs to be bought again so often and doesn&#x27;t do what I want, it wasn&#x27;t woth the money for me. I also noticed that on my bank statement they charged my card again for a re-order. When I ordered the 30 day trial I made sure NOT to click the automatic re-order button. I called them and they said that it was part of the 90 day trial, I told them I did not order the 90 day trial only the 30 day and would like a refund. The guy told me I would have to send the package back to them and then they would process a refund. I had read a few reviews about this happening but I figured I&#x27;d still try it, big mistake on my part. It seems like they are trying to scam people out of their money by charging their cards without them choosing the auto re-order option on the chance maybe they won&#x27;t notice. I will stick with Panteen and Biolage as my shampoos and I do not recomend this product!</li>
    <li> no, I was disappointed.</li>
    <li> I liked this and most Wen products the best things in this set are the replenishing mist which even works on your face and the re-moist great for once a month and after coloring</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.... She loves it... Better ask somebody that uses it themselves...</li>
    <li> My wife love this product she said she see a different after useing this so she recomment this.she said that her hair feel better</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. I have used Wen products before and I love the way it makes my hair feel. Top of the line for half the cost</li>
    <li> It is a good product but not worth the price for me personally. It seemed to weigh my hair down.</li>
    <li> I can say that my hair is smoother when I use it, but I believe it&#x27;s because I use massive amounts of the treatment after each shampoo. I am somewhat unhappy because the Texture Balm included in this kit was obviously &amp;#34; past due date &amp;#34; as it smelled like a 10 years old lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I most likely will give this brand another try but will order direct from vendor so that my product is &amp;#34; fresh &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I only received my shipment a few days ago and have used it a few times.  So far it does what it says.  My hair is soft but not oily.  In the morning (before showering) it does not look dirty. I may be able to go longer periods of time between washing.  I look forward to trying so of the other scents.</li>
    <li> The first time I shampood my hair with Wen I was so impressed with the sheen, unbelievable managablity and ease of styling. I liked it so much after the first use that I bought it for my daughter. I have used the Wen a total of four times and am very unhappy. My hair became so weighed down that it lost its bounce and looked greasy. I used a clafiying shampoo twice before I could get the heavy feel of the Wen off my hair. I will try using it once a week and see what happens. I have a lot of fine hair. My daughter who has freezy, coarce hair has washed her hair with the Wen three times so far and says her hair is not freezy at all when using the Wen. But she isnt sure either.</li>
    <li> My Hair has never looked better! Excellent Product worth the $$.</li>
    <li> This item was really great. I&#x27;m going to continue to buy this item.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product so I received it as a gift for Christmas and I love it!!! I will continue to purchase this hair care line</li>
    <li> The first time used this product I thought I liked it, then after continued use, my hair just kept getting dryer and dryer.  My hair is naturally super curly and this product just did not do what it said it would, maybe it would work better on straight hair.  I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Ive tried everything for my sensitve skin. my hair ends up oily and not conditioned and full of dandruf. Thats all over now with the wen products. I have body to my thin hair and it feels super healthy on the areas where it is color treated the life has come back in. i dont think i&#x27;ll ever use another product again.</li>
    <li> wen  [wen]&lt;br /&gt;noun&lt;br /&gt;1.&lt;br /&gt;Pathology . a benign encysted tumor of the skin, especially on the scalp, containing sebaceous matter; a sebaceous cyst.&lt;br /&gt;2.&lt;br /&gt;British . a large, crowded city or a crowded urban district: London is the great wen of England.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone name a hair care product the same as a scalp cyst?  Eww[...]  I have not bought the product; was just grossed out by the name.</li>
    <li> I got this as a surprise for my wife, and she is extremely happy with its performance. I will be definitely ordering more.</li>
    <li> I can not go without my wen. I have been using this product for ywars. It help change my repair my hair, that was dryer,  breaking, and dull. I definitely recommend anyone to used this product. You cannot go wrong.</li>
    <li> I bought WEN after seeing it advertised on TV, but bought it through Amazon to avoid their &amp;#34;automatic&amp;#34; billing/sending of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it three times - the 2nd time was OK - the first and third not so great.  I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that you have to use SO much &#x3D; 15 pumps!! to get any kind of result.  If you don&#x27;t, your hair is sticky and not smooth at all!  Add to that, you have to leave it on for at least 3-5 minutes according to the directions, and frankly, I don&#x27;t have that kind of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - back to regular shampoo and Moroccanoil - it&#x27;s the BEST.</li>
    <li> I have heard about WEN products and decided would give it a try...What a good choice. I color my hair (a little gray) and it usually washed out after 2-3 weeks...but with WEN, it doesn&#x27;t wash the color out, and it actually lasts longer than it usually did.  Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dull and lifeless...My hair had been falling out by the nandsful every time I washed it, but now it has little fallout.  Hence, the head of hair is becoming thicker and longer ... Very nice.  I suggest that if you thought about using this product, do it.  Give it a month&#x27;s try.  You decide, but I think you, too will be convinced it is better for the health of your hair.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I tried many haircare products on the market, and found WEN to be working fabulous for my hair type. WEN made my hair smooth, shine, soft and no frizzles or tangles. The other haircare products that I tried may have made my hair feel smooth, but still look very dry!&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is too expensive for a 12oz bottle!!</li>
    <li> It came in on time, great packaging and i love the product. It&#x27;s great for anyone and everyone to use. Even with mixed hair like my own! ^_^ So relax, you seriously have nothing to lose. Glad my hair is growing down my back again.</li>
    <li> I used WEN products on a regular basis for the past three years.  The WEN seemed to be comparable to what I was previously using, and I liked the convenience of the automatic shipments.  I recently used a hand-held mirror to look at the back of my hair. (which I had not done in quite some time).  The top back of my hair is SO thin that you can see my scalp!  Prior to using the WEN I was letting my long layers grow in and my hair was almost one length.  When I looked at the back, there is SO much breakage it looked like the layers were back in a very bad way.  I was completely horrified!  My hair grows SO slowly...it will take at least a few more years to grow it back....IF it grows back!  I didn&#x27;t immediately think it was the WEN until I went online and read other reviews of hair loss and breakage.  I&#x27;m so upset with WEN and myself for not noticing sooner!!</li>
    <li> My cousin loves her Wen shampoo, but it makes my hair heavy and somewhat oily looking next to my head.  It doesn&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
    <li> For years I have tried everything on the market for dry, frizzy hair.......never found anything that worked as well as WEN.  This product is super! I&#x27;m ordering more this week! Love it Love it Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried Wen hair care, hoping it would help with split ends.  It was not a helpful product for my hair.  I have fine but thick hair, and I ended up with sticky feeling hair with flyaway dry ends.  But to add insult, I was encouraged to set up an account so I could get advice from a Wen Consultant.  DO NOT DO THIS!!  I have been charged monthly and shipped products I have not ordered.  I was told I had not cancelled my account within 30 days, so they could do this.  I cancelled my account right away.  Two more charges to my credit card later I was told the last shipment (that I did not want) was a three month supply, so in addition to the amount paid for the shipment, I had to make installments of $30/month until the three months runs out.  The product is not worth it - and the money that it will cost, and the time to sort it out, is a hassle I truly hope nobody else has to go through.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.....</li>
    <li> After all the commercials, I finally ordered this a while back. I was excited about it, but after a few shampoos, my hair was oily and flat. I gave it to my sister to try because her hair tends to the dry side. The other thing that bothered me was that they tried to force me into an ordering schedule. I don&#x27;t know if they still do that, but it was frustrating. A lot of people seem to like this stuff, so maybe it&#x27;s just not for all hair types. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> PROS: product has made my crunchy, brittle, frizz-prone hair softer, shinier, stronger; smells wonderful; has worked as advertised. CONS: somewhat pricey; not a large selection of different products or scents. OVERALL: After one month of using 3-4x a week, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the complaints here, it appears a lot of folks are unhappy about issues that are their own fault: misunderstandings regarding autoship, or not using the product as directed; for example, a few people are wound up about the product not lasting 30 days or it made their hair greasy/caused buildup. The company doesn&#x27;t recommend daily use of the cleansing conditioner. It specifically states to use 3-4x a week. If you use it daily, YES, you&#x27;ll have buildup and YES, it&#x27;ll run out sooner. Furthermore, common sense dictates that you ACTUALLY READ THE FINE PRINT. If anything isn&#x27;t crystal clear, ask questions. Someone also complained that &amp;#34;the shampoo doesn&#x27;t even lather.&amp;#34; Did you even WATCH the infomercial? If so, you&#x27;ll know that 1) it&#x27;s a CLEANSING CONDITIONER, not a shampoo; and 2) it&#x27;s NOT SUPPOSED to lather; the ingredient that makes shampoo lather is what damages hair. This product doesn&#x27;t contain that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mean to disregard the genuine gripes some customers have posted about; it shouldn&#x27;t be so difficult to receive a refund when it&#x27;s legitimately due. However, my own experience with both the product and the company have been overwhelmingly positive.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work with my hair.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money, nothing more than a bottle of conditioner! Your hair never feels clean and it looks like you saturated with oil after abut 3 washes. If you look at Chaz Dean&#x27;s greasy hair, that&#x27;s what your hair will look like. I quit using it and went back to normal shampoo and conditioner and now my hair looks like the models on his infomercial. I also gave this as a Christmas gift to my best friend and she had the same results. I had to apologize to her for giving her this greasy conditioner not to mention the money I&#x27;m out and the embarrassment. What a scam ladies, don&#x27;t do it.</li>
    <li> Totally different hair experience.  The shampoo is so silky it feels like conditioner.  This is a good cleansing and conditioning system for your hair.</li>
    <li> Well, of course this depends on each individuals hair type, but I still prefer a regular shampoo. But used in a moderate amount its a great conditioner. Actually my dog has prettier hair than I do, so I&lt;br /&gt;condition his furr with wen after using his dog shampoo. The rosemary mint fragrance is awesome, and my Yorkie has very shinny beautiful furr using Wen. Lol!!!</li>
    <li> My hair IS less frizzy, more manageable, looks, great - better than it has in a long time.  But after a week, I started to develop acne on my neck and back.  This acne is deep and cystic like,  I did a search online and see this is a common problem.  I have found no solution and will have to stop using the product.</li>
    <li> Product is OK, but not worth the price. Their business practices are suspect.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and the \\&quot;pomegranate\\&quot; still needs help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others I thought I was getting the 30 day supply they said no 60 when I called about the 2nd charge 2 weeks after I got the order. Long story short I got my RA# to return it, they claim they never got it and told me it&#x27;s past the return time and \\&quot;sorry\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes I had a mail receipt, but this all occurred through the holidays. They said it would take 4-6 weeks to process it  and by the time I was they never got it my proof I had returned it was gone.  Yep I&#x27;m out the 2 pmts and they want the balance. BBB?</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t do what I was hoping it would. I have very thin hair and I thought it would be perfect, I was disappointed..</li>
