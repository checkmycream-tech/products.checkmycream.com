<li> Overall, the product dried my quite a while and put volume to my hair.  </li>

<li> With coarse hair it usually takes a long time and not a smooth process but using this</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s average length should be longer for having to move it from side to side of you head and trying to style with it.</li>
<li> and i have ALOT of hair its long and really thick</li>
<li> and it dried my hair.  </li>
<li> I previously owned a Rusk Speed Freak and was hoping for something comparable but less expensive.</li>

    <li> I was hoping for a little more power with this hairdryer. I previously owned a Rusk Speed Freak and was hoping for something comparable but less expensive. While it definitely is nowhere near as powerful as the speed freak, it does the job well. It is very light and the attachments are great. I have fine hair so it still takes quite a while to dry with this dryer. But, for the price that is to be expected.</li>
    <li> It has the three basic setting (hot, warm, and cool) plus a cold button (a little cooler than the cool setting) It dries my thick longer hair in 5 minutes and my hair (color plus highlights processed) comes out smooth &amp; shiny w/minimal product use</li>
    <li> Works great ! Very stylish too !!</li>

    <li> The concentrator is good for straighten hair. Exclude that everything is same with similar products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this item for a short time, and the ionizer already broke. It won&#x27;t fit on the dryer anymore. Seller was great... Item arrived quickly. Product not so great.</li>
    <li> A little lightweight and works great.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Identical to the one I&#x27;ve had, but finally bit the dust after about 10 years.</li>
    <li> It works fine , the back vent cover was broken upon arrival!</li>

    <li> I received the product earlier than the stated date on the shipping details.  So far, I just used it once and it dried my hair.  Probably, it was because I may not have use the product properly.  I was not used to drying my hair before.  Overall, the product dried my quite a while and put volume to my hair.  I like it.</li>
