      <li>I use it at night before bed, and my skin is really soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s difficult to recognize if it has truly reduced the appearance of fine lines, but I really like it as part of my skin care routine.</li>
      <li>I am a blonde in my early 60s with dry, sensitive skin, and the two together made a visible difference in my skin.</li>

    <li> me and my partner have been using this for a few months now and are amazed at the results.  definitely a keeper in the regiment!</li>
    <li> calms my skin, great fragrance, goes on light, not greasy.  works well on my sensitive skin, and in coordination with other Eminence products.</li>
    <li> Was introduce to this product by getting a facial and my face from one use felt so smooth and after usinf now about a month can see great results.</li>

Almost immediately, I noticed less ruddiness when I woke up in the morning. My face didn&#x27;t look as puffy, and ok, let&#x27;s just be real honest...I didn&#x27;t look as haggard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once again, the scent!  It isn&#x27;t overpowering, but you can catch a subtle whiff of lavender (which I absolutely love!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are premium products, and as such you a pay a bit more than what you will find in the drugstore, but a great complexion is worth it in my book.</li>
    <li> As the weather gets cold and the air dryer, I am finding this moisturizer wonderful to use nightly and daily.  With the hint of lavendar, it really is marvelous.</li>
    <li> Absolute BEST stuff EVER!!!! I use just a drop morning and night...it is amazing and makes my face feel like silk....I use many Eminence products purchased through Amazon because I can get a much better price...I have not been disappointed with ANY of their products and will continue to use them and order through Amazon...fast shipping and great products!!!</li>
    <li> While I want to love these products, for some reason eminence does not soak into my skin. I feel it lathers up a lot and then eventually gets absorbed. Texturally, not crazy about it, but it has kept my face moisturized. Not sure I see any big changes for the 2 months I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
    <li> Excellent night creme.  My skin looks great the next morning.</li>
    <li> Not for super-sensitive skin: has Ubiquinone aka Coenzyme Q10.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Eminence, and this Lavender concentrate is amazing. I use it at night before bed, and my skin is really soft in the morning. I highly recommend this and all Eminence products.</li>
    <li> My face had begun to have an allergic reaction, so I&#x27;ve discontinued use</li>
