      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have one clock in the house that isn&#x27;t flashing 12:00 when the power goes out!</li>
      <li>We loved the nature sounds, but when an alarm clock puts you to sleep, and then never wakes you up, there is a problem if you have a job.  </li>

      <li>Radio quality is good on am and fm; I like the telescoping antenna which gives the compact unit</li>

      <li>Nice clock with good features.  </li>

      <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use and sounds great.  </li>
      <li>The radio, however, has great sound quality.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to get any kind of warranty service, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>I sleep better with Nature Sounds than without, so it is definitely Good for my Health.  </li>
      <li>I tell you, having pleasurable sounds in home is a nice idea in theory but after some time you just do not use it.    </li>
      <li>I own this product and like the fact that it has both nature sounds and a radio.</li>
      <li>I like the nature sounds on this product, and it&#x27;s a nice size to pack when traveling.</li>
      <li>It was nice while it lasted, but it broke after about a month of use.  </li>
      <li>just about everything is wonderful except one main thing that does NOT work for me.  </li>
      <li>If you want great sound quality, however, you might want to spend the bucks on a better product or use a CD.</li>
      <li>Works fine, good idea, but when the volume is turned up, the speaker has a lot of distortion.</li>
      <li>and my first child always slept beautifully.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, gentler way to wake up.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing -- this clock must be plugged in to use most of the features, but it uses batteries to keep the time.  </li>
      <li>The best kind of relaxation especially the rain, mountain stream and ocean waves.</li>
      <li>I am extremely happy as it is an exact replacement.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ocean: Not as good as a Dan Gibson CD but not bad at all considering the format.</li>
      <li>I love the crickets.</li>
      <li>I love this clock.</li>
      <li>The Rain/Waterfall sounds were ok</li>
      <li>Sounds are ok and help lure you to sleep</li>
      <li>The radio is better than any clock radio i&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
      <li>I have purchased homedic products for many years.  </li>
      <li>sounds most alarms use.</li>
      <li>I THOUGHT SURE</li>
      <li>The sounds are perfect and block outside noise</li>
      <li>I love this machine.</li>
      <li>Probably the next best thing after Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sounds are OK and they do the job of blocking out the neighbors barking dog</li>
      <li>but as stated, I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
      <li>Maybe the higher-priced models work better.</li>
      <li>All in all, it&#x27;s ok</li>
      <li>I tried the sound machine in her room and she has not had a restless night since!</li>
      <li>i love to listen to the summer night.  </li>
      <li>when trying to get children to sleep also, they love it.</li>
      <li>The sleeping to the ocean is my favorite part.</li>
      <li>I received one for a gift many years ago and it lasted probably 7-8 years.  </li>
      <li>and I thought it was static from a radio.</li>
      <li>I like being able to go to sleep to the sounds.  </li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m looking for a better one with more sounds.</li>
      <li>and I had it for many years.  </li>
      <li>When I wake in the night I like to glance at the clock to see how much more time I have to sleep.  </li>
      <li>Just received my spa clock today, and must agree the &amp;quot;sounds&amp;quot; could be cleaned up better.</li>
      <li>I used to love this machine.  </li>
      <li>you think they could have made it look a lil more appealing to the eye</li>
      <li>okay</li>
      <li>Pretty good product.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s been pretty good.</li>
      <li>The Sound Spa Clock/Radio is an all-around great product.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s far more compact than the flying saucer or the slicer, which is great when space is at a premium.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and the sounds are pretty good digitized copies of nature.  </li>
      <li>Love this Sound Machines</li>
      <li>natual sounds really do sound like static.</li>
      <li>(I could handle static, but even if I tune the radio to an AM station with no reception, when I turn on the sound part of the machine, I can still hear someone singing or talking in the background).  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the Falls, it sounded like static to me, but the other sounds were great!</li>
      <li>The sounds are fine, though, I thought that the \\&quot;rain\\&quot; sound sounding like static.</li>
      <li>I finally gave up and returned it for good!</li>
      <li>We had an old fashioned alarm clock that woke us up ready to scream, and decided that this clock would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>The clock is still easy to</li>
      <li>good radio reception&lt;BR&gt;- better sound quality than most clock radios at same price</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Broken when we got it. Not worth the bother to return it it sucked.</li>
    <li> ok, so everyone gets this thing, its broken, or broke, blah blah blah... some people even said brand new out of the box broken....  For me, brand new out of the box BROKEN... so why am I giving it 5 stars?  Well after reading horrible review after horrible review... I realized chances are it will break or be doa... I needed a cheap radio for the MOH for my phone system (the on hold music).  I could not find a alarm clock or anything cheaper this this junk with a headphone jack...  its also Prime... Primed it... got it... broken... no surprise... I had the suspicion, but after seeing the buttons in the picture before I ordered it, I realized that it had the ability to just be a radio... now in days radios never break, that is one thing that could not be broke... so I turned it on, and it works, it tunes... so i&#x27;m keeping it... the display doesn&#x27;t work, it lights up... So 5 stars as JUST a RADIO... other than that, it is technically junk.</li>
    <li> my old one died after 12 years, and this one is very similar. still figuring out the differences but like this new one fine</li>
    <li> I got this had it a week before it started to loose function. Now half the sounds don&#x27;t work.  Don&#x27;t buy this</li>
    <li> For the price of twenty bucks (not including S &amp; H) this is not a bad product. It serves as an AM/FM clock radio with a retractable antenna for improved reception, and of course has the \\&quot;nature sounds\\&quot; feature for those of us who find white noise to be a healthier and more effective way of getting prime Z&#x27;s without resorting to pills or a slug of rye. The unit is small, lightweight and portable, and can operate either with a power cord and a few batteries or batteries alone, making it a good choice to accompany you to any strange beds in which you might be sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sounds offered on the machine are Wind, Brook, Night, Rain, Falls or Ocean. I rate them as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wind: A big disappointment, this sounds like an extended explosion and is about as relaxing as being in a crawling artillery barrage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brook: This is not too bad, but it bears and unfortunate resemblance to a certain other \\&quot;sound of nature\\&quot; you may not find so relaxing. Furthermore, the sound is not well looped, so that certain repetetive background noises become very annoying over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night: Essentially just cricket sounds, but extremely relaxing, especially if you grew up in the suburbs or the country, where this is the natural background noise between April and October. My favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rain: This one was another disappointment. The sound loop is again too short, and there are no secondary noises such as wind to mix it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ocean: Not as good as a Dan Gibson CD but not bad at all considering the format. Probably the next best thing after Night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall sound quality of the noises is fairly poor, almost as if they were recorded on My Li&#x27;l Reminder or a telephone answering machine rather than a proper microphone, and I&#x27;m not crazy about the rear-mounted speaker, which renders music tinny and somewhat flat. The stand which props up the unit is also cheap and will break if you don&#x27;t remove it prior to travel. However, considering the very modest price tag -- not much higher than a generic Target clock radio -- there isn&#x27;t much cause for complaint here. If you&#x27;re looking for something which can perform the usual clock radio functions with some enjoyable bennies on the side, this ain&#x27;t a bad choice. If you want great sound quality, however, you might want to spend the bucks on a better product or use a CD.However, considering the very modest price tag -- not much higher than a generic Target clock radio -- there isn&#x27;t much cause for complaint here.

    <li> Major problem with this product.  I bought it so that I could sleep to the spa sounds, but the alarm clock only works if no sounds (or radio) are on.  What good is that?  The previous version of the product was great and I had it for many years.  Now I had to buy an alarm clock so that I can sleep to the spa sounds.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The sounds are wonderful--just about everything is wonderful except one main thing that does NOT work for me.  It states on the box and insert &amp;quot;Large digit, LCD display illuminated by glowing backlight.&amp;quot;  I cannot see the display and it is NOT back-lit.  The LCD display area is deceptively small.  I&#x27;m truly disappointed that it is useless to me.</li>
    <li> This clock radio suffers from several problems.&lt;BR&gt;   1) The button design is such that you must grab the radio to keep it from moving away from you when you try to hit the on/off and snooze buttons.&lt;BR&gt;   2)  The tuner gets dust in it very quickly and it becomes very hard to tune to a particular station...ditto on the volume control.&lt;BR&gt;   3)  The actual clock has small digits and poor lighting.  This makes it hard to see in the middle of the night.&lt;BR&gt;    On a personal note the nature sounds didn&#x27;t wake me up anyway.</li>
    <li> When I first got my Sounds Spa, it was great...for about two weeks.  After those two weeks of use, however, the sounds just stopped working.  The clock worked, but the rest didn&#x27;t.  My guess is that it&#x27;s not meant to be played continuously for the entire night, which is what I did.  Maybe if you just use it for 30 or so minutes at a time, it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this machine. I have had mine for over 6 years now and it works just fine. I really like the dimmer light in the display as it does not shine in my eyes all night long. I also like the auto shut off feature for the sounds. It has been a very faithful clock to me. I am about to purchase my second one as I am ready for a new one only because my current model has discolored , it was the white model so I am upgrading to black. Over all I give this a very good rating and reccomend this machine</li>
    <li> The designers of this clock forgot a few things, like making sure the clock doesn&#x27;t slide away when you try to turn off the alarm.  They also didn&#x27;t think that someone might want to actually see what time it is in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worst design ever, and the sound quality is pretty poor too.</li>
    <li> The clock arrived with the rubber feet falling off all over, and a rusted battery, and the hour button to change the time did not work.  I returned it for a replacement and still have not received another one.  I am very disappointed with this whole thing.  In addition, the cost of the clock was $19.99 and the shipping was $20.00.  I specified that they send it the cheapest way possible and i guess this was their solution.  This company has serious problems.</li>
    <li> Bought this and I thought it was static from a radio. Instead of soothing, ir-ratates! Sold at atg sale for $1.00 to get rid of this piece of junk</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Sound Spa for a couple weeks and there&#x27;s good and bad to report.  The good:  The antenna allows it to pick up stations that my old clock radio could not get reliably.  Also, the rotary dials used to select the station and volume are faster and more direct than other radios, where the station dial moves a little selector bar through a separate display window and the volume dial has no feedback mechanism to tell you how loud it is set.  I also like that the clock uses batteries so that  you don&#x27;t have to reset it if the power goes out.  (I live in California, after all.)&lt;br /&gt;The radio and nature sounds are what you would expect for $20 -- not great but sufficient to drown out the crazy guy next door who makes chicken sounds all day.&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  First, I could not figure out how to turn the alarm off until I emailed Homedics.  The little booklet doesn&#x27;t tell you anything about it.  If you do nothing, the alarm will go off at midnight! Homedics replied to my email and I now know that you push the AL Mode button until none of the options (Buzzer, Sound, or Radio) are displayed.  But be careful...that&#x27;s classified information that cannot get into the wrong hands (like customers).&lt;br /&gt;Second, the speaker points out THE BACK of the unit, so my neighbor has an easier time hearing All Things Considered than I do (well, when he isn&#x27;t clucking and cooing ).  Third, forget about checking the time in the dark unless you get up close and personal with it.  The LCD display is too faint to be any good.  Finally, it&#x27;s cheaply made.  The stand broke as I tried to attach it to the unit.</li>
    <li> I have the same problems with the display, etc. as everyone else mentioned, plus I would like to add the following:       1. Buttons require too much force to press down and are awkward;       2. Radio and nature sounds share the same volume knob, which means if you turn the nature sounds down a bit and your alarm is set for radio or buzzer, you may not hear your alarm in the morning (this happened to me and made me late to work);       3. The only way to &#x27;un-set&#x27; the alarm is to cycle through all sound settings;       4. The Snooze button and the sound On/Off button are right next to each other and similar in shape, meaning you can very easily turn the alarm sound off instead of hitting Snooze as intended (this also happened to me).       I strongly dislike this item and am sending it back. The sounds and FM reception are OK, but it is very poorly designed and not worth the money.</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- good radio reception&lt;BR&gt;- better sound quality than most clock radios at same price&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- clock display is too small, hard to read in either of the clock&#x27;s postions, laying down or standing up.&lt;BR&gt;- natual sounds really do sound like static.</li>
    <li> I purchased this SoundSpa over five years ago after the birth of my first child.  I had read about \\&quot;sounds\\&quot; being relaxing for infants and thought I would give it a try.  I have no complaints only praise.  Although I don&#x27;t use the alarm features on this machine I have to say that the sound features and quality are nothing but superb.  I leave it on all night (no timer - set to 0) and my first child always slept beautifully.  We used it from the beginning with our second child as it is a necessity in the nursery.  Every trip we take always includes the SoundSpa.  It works wonders to block out the excess noise in hotels and staying with family.  It brings that one familiar piece of home while we are traveling.  I wouldn&#x27;t go a day without it.  After five years of good service it is time to retire it and purchase a new one.  I will stick with the Homedics brand!</li>
    <li> Pretty good product.  My son received this for Christmas and has used it every night to help him get to sleep.  He especially likes the beach setting.  He uses it for 15 minutes every night.  He also is getting up very nicely to the buzzer alarm in the morning.</li>
    <li> I used to love this machine.  As time went on, however, when I listen to the \\&quot;ocean sounds\\&quot; to fall asleep to, I can hear the noise of a radio station in the background (when the ocean sound lulls every few seconds).  Nothing that I have tried to do to fix this problem works (I could handle static, but even if I tune the radio to an AM station with no reception, when I turn on the sound part of the machine, I can still hear someone singing or talking in the background).  Currently, I have jammed the radio tuner halfway between AM and FM which worked for about a week until some random station started playing again.  Also, if the alarm mode is set to \\&quot;off,\\&quot; the sound machine will still turn off at whatever time the alarm was last set to (which will wake up the light sleepers among us).</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my son who can not sleep without this on. The last one lasted about 8 years and he would not even consider a different kind. Works great and he is happy. Good price for me so I am happy. Happy all around.</li>
    <li> This is the second Homedics Sound Machine I&#x27;ve purchased. The other one broke after a week so I got this because of all the features. It&#x27;s in my babies room. All the sounds sound very similar and not that soothing. The stand has already broken. We also couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get the sound to stop coming on at a certain time everyday - not easy to get all the features to work (or stop working) unless you can find your directions. All in all, it&#x27;s ok but I prefer my stripped down Conair by leaps and bounds. In all fairness, it&#x27;s difficult to find a sound machine you really like; my parents have been looking for one forever.&lt;br /&gt;Additional note:  The sound feature has stopped working after about a year of use.</li>
    <li> It was nice while it lasted, but it broke after about a month of use.  The sounds loop after about one second, which on some of them gives them a rhythm that I found hard to sleep to.  But other sounds are good and restful.  I haven&#x27;t tried to get any kind of warranty service, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I recieved my package today, and to my major dissappointment, the sound quality produced by this nature alarm clock is horrific. After listening to my new clock for the first time a buzz developed that I have been unable to get rid of also. Probably the biggest dissappointment though was the fact that the alarm clock that I got was not the one pictured. The buttons on the top are different, and there are no dials on the left side. It appears like I was sent an earlier model then what is pictured, so buyers beware.</li>
    <li> I bought it almost two years ago and it worked okay for only 6 motnhs or so and then I started having problems with sound. ALso when I turn volume wheel, it makes weired noises and volume control is gone almost. Clock display is so small that you can not read it in the morning (though I have 20/20 eyesight). Though it is still working after two years and I daily wake up using beep alarm. I tell you, having pleasurable sounds in home is a nice idea in theory but after some time you just do not use it.    and how thehell you setup this rating/voting ON ? While giving review, I do not see any option like this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one of these like the one in the picture for years and it&#x27;s been pretty good. BUT- the one I was sent was NOT this model. It had totally different knobs and buttons and was not good quality. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Love this Sound Machines</li>
    <li> I could not set the time. So returned it. Too cheap. Hard to fine one of these. They&#x27;re either dirt cheap and crappy or $100 and crappy.</li>
    <li> We gave this as a gift and the recipient can&#x27;t quit lauding it for sound selections, ability to stand it up or lay it down, radio audio and being multi functioned in a small case.  Says perfect for the person who has trouble falling asleep.  It is a GREAT, well priced gift or your own use.</li>
    <li> it was broken when I got it, so had to send it back. The reason I bought it in the first place is that I owed on just like it years ago</li>
    <li> I bought this item for my husband because he often has trouble relaxing and getting to sleep.  It looks like a flimsy plastic radio and while it has several different sound settings, the all pretty much sound alike, because there&#x27;s static drowning out all of them.  If you really want a sound machine, I would suggest going with a pricier Sharper Image type model.</li>
    <li> Just received my spa clock today, and must agree the &amp;quot;sounds&amp;quot; could be cleaned up better. The &amp;quot;wind&amp;quot;, sounds like what it is - a mike held outside with all the backgound hissing to go with it. The &amp;quot;rain&amp;quot; could be more clear and a little less repetive. The best are the &amp;quot;ocean&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;brook&amp;quot;. The unit comes with a stand to set it upright, but I found the sound is improved if the unit is flat on a soft surface, like a cusion or a pillow; improves the base a bit. The clock is still easy to see.&lt;br /&gt; The radio, however, has great sound quality. It picks up stations my stereo won&#x27;t get! The clock requires 2 AAA&#x27;s all the time, and are included to get you started. The unit can be used with the adapter, or with 4 AA&#x27;s. With it&#x27;s great travel size,(think paperback) and battery feature, it can go overseas with me as well. Overall, it&#x27;s 20 bucks well spent.</li>
    <li> I own this product and like the fact that it has both nature sounds and a radio. But the one problem I have is that the stand that hooks on the back of the product broke after I dropped it off my night stand, and the HoMedics people were very so rude so now I am stuck with a broken stand, and I now have to be careful how I set it down. Other than that I recommend this product. My neighbor borrowed this product when she had her baby and it put the baby right to sleep with the nature sounds. It is great for people of all ages.</li>
    <li> Most of Homedics&#x27; products are cheap imports with poor design.  I had this unit less than two hours before the rubber feet designed to prevent the unit from slipping fell off, naturally somewhere where I can&#x27;t find them.&lt;br /&gt;The sounds are decent - it&#x27;s one saving grace.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual does not tell you how to install the batteries.  The AAA installation (required even with the AC adapter) is not at all intuitive.</li>
    <li> The sounds are OK and they do the job of blocking out the neighbors barking dog but you can&#x27;t read the time day or night.  When I wake in the night I like to glance at the clock to see how much more time I have to sleep.  Will forget it with this clock.  You have to put your face right up to it to see what time it is.  Very disappointing.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to my old clock/radio.</li>
    <li> Works fine, good idea, but when the volume is turned up, the speaker has a lot of distortion. It was cheap, but I would rather have paid a few more dollars for better sound quality.</li>
    <li> *written by my wife*  We had an old fashioned alarm clock that woke us up ready to scream, and decided that this clock would be perfect.  It took us 20 minutes or so to get it turned on.  Right from the bat, the electric cord wouldn&#x27;t work. Because it can be portable, it has a plug-in style electrical cord, not the standard attached kind.  Somehow, it couldn&#x27;t connect unless you held it a certain way.  With a little maneuvering, we got it to connect.  Figuring out how to have the alarm work correctly was something else.  The clock would only keep time for a short while.  Next thing we knew, it would be an hour or so off.  The alarm would go off on the clock&#x27;s time, not our time, or not go off at all, but be accurate.  We loved the nature sounds, but when an alarm clock puts you to sleep, and then never wakes you up, there is a problem if you have a job.  So... I don&#x27;t remember if we donated it or just plain threw it away, but it didn&#x27;t live up to our expectations.  A more sturdy design, and a more consistent power source may convince me in the future, but as long as this looks like a dollar store radio for department store cost, it will not have a place in our home.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product was not a good option for blocking out outside noise so our little one could sleep.  Although it should stay on contiuously through the night (if set to) it would turn off sporadically causing disruptions in sleep rather than a good night&#x27;s rest. Also the clock is poorly lighted for viewing in the dark.</li>
    <li> This was not all that impressive a sound machine when it worked, but on top of that, it died last week when I used it for only the second time.  The power is there, and the light comes on, but it&#x27;s deader than Julius Caesar and won&#x27;t make a noise.  For an item this large and bulky, this thing just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
    <li> I really need a sound machine to help with my sleep. Any outside noise wakes me up and I have trouble getting back to sleep.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other sound soothers but this one really helps me with all my sleep problems.  I&#x27;m going to buy a second machine for my friend&#x27;s birthday as he has the same sleep problems as I have. The radio works pretty well also.  If you need a sound machine with an alarm clock and a radio, this one is the best.</li>
    <li> I suppose this clock is ok for the price, but the repetitiveness of the sounds makes it useless for relaxation while falling asleep.  With the lights out and nothing else going on, it takes surprisingly little time to realize that the sounds repeat every six seconds or so.  A real babbling brook may be relaxing but the same glub-glub-gurgle-BLOP--glub-glub-gurgle-BLOB--glub-glub-gurgle-BLOP over and over again isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I do like this clock as a part of my waking-up routine.  I have this thing start up a half-hour or so before my regular alarm clock.  It&#x27;s a nice, gentler way to wake up.&lt;br /&gt;Another thing -- this clock must be plugged in to use most of the features, but it uses batteries to keep the time.  It&#x27;s nice to have one clock in the house that isn&#x27;t flashing 12:00 when the power goes out!</li>
    <li> you think they could have made it look a lil more appealing to the eye</li>
    <li> I like the nature sounds on this product, and it&#x27;s a nice size to pack when traveling. Setting and activating the alarm, however, is very confusing. The alarm mode (sound, radio, buzzer) always displays on the clock, however, there is no indicator to tell you whether the alarm is set to go off or not. I changed the alarm mode from sound to buzzer for future reference, but didn&#x27;t think I had set the alarm (it was still at 12:00 midnight) or activated it.&lt;br /&gt;So what happened? The buzzer woke me from a sound sleep at midnight. I hit the on/off button, but I still have no idea if the alarm is activated or not. Is it going to go off again at midnight? Hard to say. Most clocks have a little symbol or indicator to show that the alarm is set. I wish this clock did, too. If the alarm mode is the indicator, then I can&#x27;t get it to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;The instruction book that came with the clock isn&#x27;t very helpful. Setting the alarm isn&#x27;t hard, being able to tell if it&#x27;s actually going to go off is.&lt;br /&gt;After I had this for awhile, I noticed another small annoyance: when I turn the nature sounds on, the numbers on the clock no longer display. Not very helpful.</li>
    <li> - Sounds like statics, nothing like nature sounds&lt;BR&gt;- Time is off by a minute every day&lt;BR&gt;- un-readable from lying down position&lt;BR&gt;- timer totally unpredictable&lt;br /&gt;Summary: totally useless</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by Homedic&#x27;s description. this is not a spa product. The clock is easy to set, but is a poor visual quality. The light on the clock is horrible. even worse, the nature sounds are horrible. they sound like static, and the sounds are way too repetitive. the radio tunes ok, but it is a poor sounding radio. the buttons are not good. they are terrible. And, the speakers are 9n the back. That makes it sound like it&#x27;s coming from your other room. Sorry, but this product is a piece of junk. It broke after two weeks. It&#x27;s a very poor quality. So avoid this and get a better system taht will work better for a long time.  So avoid this horrible.</li>
    <li> This is very cheaply made and really a defective product.  I bought this to help my baby sleep with repetitive sounds and to block out the dog barking and other children in the house.  The volume control was very sketchy, it would be quite and then cut-out and then be loud and then cut out again.  After only a month it stopped working completely.  I took it back to the store and exchanged it.  The same thing happened two more times with two different units.  I finally gave up and returned it for good!</li>
    <li> Our first clock broke within two weeks and would play the cricket sounds over and over until you finally unplugged it.  We bought a second and the clock display burned out within a week and not one sound worked.  Don&#x27;t buy this unless you want a big hassle, it is junk.</li>
    <li> I purchased this machine last year for myself. I ended up using it for my then 2 year old. She would wake up all night for no apparant reason. I tried the sound machine in her room and she has not had a restless night since! Even when she is sick, she sleeps great and if I forget to turn it on she reminds me.It has been a real blessing for us because when she&#x27;s up, everyone is up!</li>
    <li> I have this clock and think, overall, that it&#x27;s great.  I like being able to go to sleep to the sounds.  Some of the sounds, though, are repetitive, i.e., after a few minutes of listening you get tuned into the beat of the birds chirping in the &amp;quot;woods&amp;quot; selection.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s easy to use and sounds great.  The radio is better than any clock radio i&#x27;ve ever had.  The sleeping to the ocean is my favorite part.</li>
    <li> I purchased this sound machine strictly for the spa sounds to use in my daughter&#x27;s room.  I cranked the volume all the way to the highest setting and still could barely hear it.  I thought I might be doing something wrong but re-read the instructions and checked the radio and the volume seems to work fine.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter whether the unit is laying flat or standing up.  I am returning this item.</li>
    <li> We bought this to try and help our baby sleep - friends told us white noise might help.  Well, it seemed to help our baby to sleep for the few days that it worked.  Only 4 days later, none of the white noise functions work anymore.  Tried changing the batteries, that didn&#x27;t help.  We are hoping to return this item to the retail store where it was bought, since the $5 handling fee for the warranty is too much to spend on a $20 dollar item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this machine for 4 years now...I&#x27;ve been looking for another one for my 9 yr old because he likes mine so much! I&#x27;m so glad I found this!!!</li>
    <li> Beware - this is a piece of garbage.  It is cheaply made, and it only works about half of the time.</li>
    <li> I bought this unit to use only for the sound function.I have ringing in my ears and need white noise playing in the background in order to help me sleep. I use the sound \\&quot;Falls\\&quot; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am already on my second unit after 10 days of use. The 1st unit was returned after 5 days because the unit will not stay on all night even though the timer is set to \\&quot;0\\&quot; , which according to the owners manual, will keep the sound playing continiously until you  manually shut it off. However, it turns its self off every night, sometimes after 3 hours sometimes it will go 6 hours and then shut off  and when it does, I wake up ! Both units have done this so I have no faith in this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am going to return this unit (the 2nd one for me)and get my money back.</li>
    <li> The best kind of relaxation especially the rain, mountain stream and ocean waves. A must for those who experience non sleeping nights</li>
    <li> i love to listen to the summer night.  very calming effect when trying to get children to sleep also, they love it.</li>
    <li> I like that fact that it has different sounds so I can choose each night what I want to hear It fits my needs</li>
    <li> Like most sound machines, the sounds choices are limited and most have a very noticeable cycle. The brook sound actually had a click at the end! However, the ocean and white noise had a good cycle.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, only after a year, it broke. Now, I&#x27;m looking for a better one with more sounds.</li>
    <li> The Sound Spa Clock/Radio is an all-around great product. It&#x27;s 6 soothing sounds, Falls, Wind, Brook, Rain, Night, and Ocean, are very relaxing. I didn&#x27;t really enjoy the Falls, it sounded like static to me, but the other sounds were great! &lt;BR&gt;I use Ocean or Rain to help me fall asleep, and since there&#x27;s a timer, it doesn&#x27;t have to be playing all night. Then, in the morning I wake up to the Radio. You can also wake up to a generic alarm buzzer, or a soothing sound. &lt;BR&gt;This product is one I&#x27;m really glad I bought, and at it&#x27;s affordable price, it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> The SS-400B is a great item that I purchased for me and my kids.  I am afraid that the volume switch is too cheaply made to hold up to constant up and down volume use.  Mine is left at a low volume for the Ocean sounds by which to fall asleep by.  My girls were constantly using the radio (high volume) and various sounds for sleeping.  The switch [broke] within a month and I had to send it back to Homedic.  Mine still works but I worry about its longevity.</li>
    <li> I have used the        &lt;BR&gt;HoMedics SS-400B Natural Sounds Spa Clock Radio for 2 years now.  It is a wonderful item to have in the bedroom.  I particullarly like the waterfall sounds.</li>
    <li> I bought this for our guest room, primarily for the sound spa. My daughter visited, and set up the machine. She got a soothing sound for about 30 minutes, but then it quit. She assumed that she had set the timer by accident, but could not get the sound to come back on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She tried the next morning, but gave up. I tried several times over the next two days, but could not get any sounds, either the sound spa or the radio. The clock was working, and the \\&quot;sound\\&quot; button would cause the display to show different sounds--but not a sound from the machine! The \\&quot;on-off\\&quot; button (which is supposed to light up when on) does not seem to be working. I tried all new batteries, plugged in or battery power, etc., but it is not working at all.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am very disappointed. In my own bedroom, I have an inexpensive Phillips clock/soundspa that has been working flawlessly for at least 10 years, playing sounds all night, every night! I wish I could find that model for sale.</li>
    <li> I am a chronic pain sufferer with chronic daily headaches and migraines and sleep very poorly.  To sleep, I run two fans and a humidifer.  If my new husband (who is the softest snorer I&#x27;ve been around) does snore, I then use a sound machine.  With my ex, The Train, I had to use this particular model with batteries and while balancing ice on my head for my headaches I had to balance this sound machine on my ear and neck to drown him out!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lost it on some trip somewhere.  I think my first one finally wore out from overuse and I now use inferior much more expensive ones.  I am going to buy a 3rd one for travelling use if nothing else....keep it in my luggage!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE SECOND ONE OF THESE THAT I&#x27;VE HAD.  I ACTUALLY WORE OUT THE FIRST ONE BUT IT LASTED FOR NEARLY 8 YEARS, RUNNING IT EVERY NIGHT - ALL NIGHT!  I WAS SO SURPRISED TO FIND ANOTHER ONE JUST LIKE IT.  I THOUGHT SURE IT WOULD BE DISCONTINUED BY NOW AND MOST OF THE NEW ONES HAVE AUTOMATIC SHUT-OFF AND THAT IS SOMETHING I DID NOT WANT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT DIDN&#x27;T EVEN LAST 2 MONTHS!  IT TOOK UP A LOT OF ROOM AND I AM SO DISAPPOINTED THAT IT COST MORE TO SHIP BACK THAN TO BUY A NEW ONE.  NEEDLESS TO SAY, I BOUGHT A DIFFERENT BRAND THIS TIME.</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my GE Alarm Clock Radio wNature Sounds.  I like that the Radio has an Antenna on the side, instead of in the AC cord. I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord laying straight so the radio signal isn&#x27;t affected.  I really like that the Nature Sounds Buttons are on the front, making them very easy to access.  This product adds a Radio Alarm Clock to the Stress relieving Nature Sounds, not the other way around [adding Nature Sounds to a Radio Alarm clock]. I sleep better with Nature Sounds than without, so it is definitely Good for my Health.  I highly Recommend this Product &amp; this Seller.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t sleep without this! I set my TV timer for 30 minutes,  then set Waves to come on 20 minutes later. TV shuts off with the Waves going. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought one for every new grandbaby! They hear the Ocean Waves and know it&#x27;s time to go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product for light sleepers. So relaxing! Most sound machines have seagulls screaming in the background,  but this one id just the Beautifully Relaxing Waves rolling in and out!</li>
    <li> This alarm is easy to use and is a pleasant way to wake up although the clock is too small to be useful.</li>
    <li> Very unhappy with this product.  I use it to drown out noise from a family member who gets up very early.  The sound will randomly cut out in the middle of the night.  Most recently, it&#x27;s started making that horrible alarm sound (BEEEEP) when I turn on one of the nice tranquil nature sounds (and I don&#x27;t even have a battery in - you need a battery to run the clock/alarm and I just use it for the white noise effect)</li>
    <li> The clock did work! Tried changing the battery did&#x27;nt help. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Works perfectly.  Fast and efficient.</li>
    <li> The sounds were very weak sounding, and the digital time did not appear on the clock (broken) Returned to Amazon!</li>
    <li> I thought this would replace the old homedics, but it was far from the nice silver smaller one I had, with easy controls . this was unwieldy, large and ugly. the Time Set button had to be pushed in with a pen, really hard, or it would not operate the time set. I almost broke my fingernail trying to push it down as it refused to set the time. The alarm set okay but it too was not user friendly.</li>
    <li> Nice clock with good features.  Solid built and good sound.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I really like waking up to the nature sounds and my old alarm stopped working.  My wife doesn&#x27;t like the blue light most alarms come with because they are bright.  So I needed an alarm with natural sounds that didn&#x27;t have blue backlighting for the display.  This alarm was one of the few I found.  The negative; the alarm clock is huge compared to most, the display is hard to see from any angle other than straight on, and the buttons are cheap and hard to tell what settings are on.  Not bad but as stated, I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
    <li> Sounds good but clock don&#x27;t work like it should.</li>
    <li> Instructions didn&#x27;t say a batteries were needed when the machine was plugged into ac.</li>
    <li> While it&#x27;s not the best out there, you can&#x27;t beat the price. My problems are that the screen that shows the time is small and not very bright so trying to read it at any type of angle or at night is difficult. The sounds are pleasant but tend to sound similar to each other. I like the buzzer alarm because it&#x27;s more of a beeping and not one of those loud obnoxious grating sounds most alarms use. All in all, it&#x27;s a good product for the low price.</li>
    <li> This is an odd item. I got it for the sounds (to cover noise in my bedroom), but they are less than I was expecting. For example the sounds repeat every 5 seconds. Once I heard the pattern, it started to be annoying in stead of relaxing. Also it requires 2 AAA batteries EVEN WHEN you have it plugged into the AC outlet. This wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to be negative, but will be just possibly to save anyone else from wasting their money.  I agree that the sounds were good, but these are available on so many other products.  If you used it only for the sounds, perhaps you won&#x27;t be totally disappointed.  Similar to a previous reviewer, my stand broke as well (and you basically have to lay it flat without a stand - it would be tough to repair given it&#x27;s construction).  Furthermore, the radio tuner is terrible.  I receive a strong signal to a particular station, but it kept drifting in and out of static on this radio because the tuning band is so narrow.  That was really irritating. Finally, the clock did not even keep proper time;  it was off about 15 minutes per month.  Hope these comments help.</li>
    <li> I did not get to use the HoMedics much before it was totally non-functional.  Neither the sound machine nor the clock work with new batteries, after only 10 or so uses.  Plugging in the AC Adapter does not help.&lt;BR&gt;I looked at the warranty, since I bought the unit only a few months ago.  I am supposed to mail the unit postage paid, along with a certified check or money order for five dollars.  HoMedics has successfully made the warranty almost useless for a twenty dollar item.</li>
    <li> Owned this for probably 4 years now.  I bought it for the sounds, so I don&#x27;t use the radio or alarm.  Display still works, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is cheaply made.  I have trained myself to grab it and push the off button in the morning.  Otherwise you&#x27;ll simply push it away.  The volume and tuner are hard to use, but since I bought it for the sounds (which I think sound fine) that is not very important.</li>
    <li> This is a great radio. I had one before and I dropped it and it stopped working. I finally found this one. I keep the &amp;#34;summer night&amp;#34; on all the time. I love the crickets. All the other sounds all sound the same to me. They&#x27;re all water They won&#x27;t sound the same to everybody. This is a great product and I suggest buying it. It may also help babies go to sleep. As soon as I received it I opened it and turned on the crickets. I like the rain sound, too. I suggest this to anyone who likes sound to sleep by.</li>
    <li> We have put one in all of our bedrooms.  Great for getting a good nights sleep.  Cuts out all outside noises.</li>
    <li> It was broken when she opened it on Christmas morning.  Pretty unsatisfied.  The quality didn&#x27;t see very good for $25 even if it did work.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband and it broke in exactly one month.  The buttons no longer operate, the sound effects stopped working all together, and the only way to turn the music feature off is to unplug it.  Let&#x27;s not forget to mention that even the clock stopped functioning.</li>
    <li> Great price for a combination clock/radio/sound machine.  &amp;#34;Falls&amp;#34; setting is essentially white noise, at a fraction of the price of a white noise maker.</li>
    <li> This item is quite literally a piece of junk. It didn&#x27;t just have one thing wrong with it: it was a complete, incomprehensible mess. First, pressing the button for &amp;#34;Envirascape sounds&amp;#34; resulted in bizarre piercing squawks. The selection buttons didn&#x27;t do anything: there was no waterfall sound, or white noise. Just these horrible squawks. Hitting the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button didn&#x27;t turn it off -- I actually had to UNPLUG it to get it to shut up. Once out of maybe ten times it&#x27;d actually make the nature sounds, and I figured rather than send it back I&#x27;d put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I discovered the alarm didn&#x27;t work when the nature sounds were playing. Set the alarm to awaken to the radio or the buzzer or the nature sounds, and nothing happens either way. If you fall asleep to white noise, then, don&#x27;t plan on getting to work on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up cannibalizing this item to repair an older model I have; otherwise I&#x27;d DEFINITELY have sent it back. It&#x27;s a piece of junk, and it should not be on the market.</li>
    <li> Having a hard time figuring out how it works. And the sounds are OK not the best recordings ever</li>
    <li> I have given this item as a gift to my mother who had this item years ago, and loved it. I wanted to find her the same exact thing. The clock that i gave her, which was less than a month ago, and the clock has completely stopped working. someone please contact me to get another one sent to me to give to my mother, I am very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product.  I already have 2 of these, one of which is about 15 years old and finally starting to die.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without one of these.  The sounds are perfect and block outside noise so I can sleep well.</li>
    <li> I have purchased homedic products for many years.  I thought I would like this particular one but found the quality to not be their normal.  I did like the size and shape but the ON/OFF button seems to be not to good and I cannot take a chance of it working for only a couple of months and then breaking.</li>
    <li> Unit is too large for it&#x27;s function.  It&#x27;s odd that the clock needs a battery but everything else works on the power cord.  Sounds are ok and help lure you to sleep but then a loud buzz or crackle interferes and snaps you awake.  The first time I heard it I thought the unit had shorted out.  I&#x27;m writing this off as a lesson learned.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> This clock radio has the expected features:snooze button, wake to alarm,to music,to sound of choice,timer to fall asleep to music or to sound. The sounds quality is not good; fair to poor. I like rain and ocean best. Radio quality is good on am and fm; I like the telescoping antenna which gives the compact unit a feel like a radio-remote control device. There is a removable piece on the back so unit can stand upright or lie flat. Only the clock will run on battery so the power cord is needed for radio and sound making the total weight impractical for an overnight bag. There is an area for AA batteries, but no mention in the literature as to why. Instructions are for AAA batteries and power cord only.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had more than my share of these things over the last couple of years.  Either they&#x27;re badly designed (I had one that looked like a flying saucer.  Another looked like something you&#x27;d use to slice vegetables.) or unreliable. (The vegetable slicer went haywire within six months.)  This time around, assuming the worst, but still wanting the option of some nature sounds, I chose this unit for the price, and I&#x27;m frankly glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s far more compact than the flying saucer or the slicer, which is great when space is at a premium.  There&#x27;s a retractable antenna, so you don&#x27;t have to fool around with those long wires that I find so annoying.  The controls are very simple; you can be operating this unit right out of the box without a moment&#x27;s hesitation.  The sound quality is decent; it&#x27;s not going to be great with any tabletop unit, but it&#x27;s as good as most of the other, more expensive tabletops.  If I have a quibble, it&#x27;s that the display is hard to see in the dark.  Not impossible, just a little small and dim.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive AM/FM clock radio with a handful of &amp;quot;natural sounds&amp;quot; you could do far worse.  Believe me, I have done.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve had sleeping problems for years. a friend purchased this product for me years ago and my sleeping problems were solved! thanks to the comforting sound of the brook (my personal favorite).while moving, it got lost. needless to say, i have not been able to sleep without it since. so i&#x27;m ordering a new one today! had it not been for minor problems with the clock, I would have given this product five stars.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. It is complicated to figure out how to operate, the dials for the radio stations and volume move too easily when groped at in the night, the radio sounds bleed over into the nature sounds and it picks up cell phone signals or sounds from outer-space -- hard to tell which but annoying and jarring in the middle of the night.  &lt;br /&gt;   The nature sounds are very artificial and the \\&quot;wind\\&quot; sound is downright frightening. Hard to relax to the sound of a hurricane! &lt;br /&gt;   The dispay is so tiny and dim it is nearly impossible to see from more than 12 inches or so. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;   Overall an awful product.</li>
    <li> I gave 3 stars for \\&quot;fair,\\&quot; which may be on the generous side. The machine sounds definitely provide \\&quot;white noise\\&quot; to drown out background sounds, which was the purpose for purchasing it. However, when the machine is plugged in, it mysteriously turns itself on, even when no one is in the room. When it turns on by itself, it switches off whatever sound we&#x27;d set it on to the harshest, least-soothing sound on the machine. When we used batteries, rather than plugging it in, it was even worse: it would run for a certain amount of time and then blare out what sounded like a cacaphonous guitar riff before falling silent. When you&#x27;re using it to lull your infant to sleep you can imagine how well that went over. Also, none of the sounds are particularly soothing - very tinny. We were unpleasantly surprised because I&#x27;d received one as a gift years earlier that works wonderfully and has never faltered. We expected the same performance from this one. Maybe the higher-priced models work better. The machine gets the job done but could definitely use improvements.</li>
    <li> Batteries corroded within the unit upon arrival, clock doesn&#x27;t work.  What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> If you enjoy a gentle, gradual awakening while pushing the snooze button a few times, do not get this clock. Once the alarm goes off and you push snooze, the sound machine part does not automatically come back on, so you go from a reasonably nice sound, to an awful buzzer (whose volume depends on which volume you had the nature sounds volume at), to dead silence. Plus, the angle of the snooze button (on the front rather than the top) makes it hard to easily push with one hand. Most of the buttons are small and hard to use.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy waking up with a jolt, this is for you.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A previous reviewer was totally correct about the Wind sound being scary! (I picture being in an Antarctic blizzard or something) The Rain/Waterfall sounds were ok but I didn&#x27;t like that I could easily pick up on its loop/pattern, which didn&#x27;t quite make it the inconspicuous \\&quot;white noise\\&quot; that it was intended to be.</li>
    <li> i am a little surprised at all the negative reviews. i have had my Homedics machine now for 5 years, and it has been wonderful. Unfortunatly, in a recent move, it broke. Now, I am getting my second machine.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The illumination of the clock is great...it is not bright like a digital/radio clock, but I prefer not to see the time when i wake in the middle of the night. The sounds are fine, though, I thought that the \\&quot;rain\\&quot; sound sounding like static. Otherwise, if you plan to buy something of this nature, don&#x27;t just pay attention to the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> I probably should have gotten a clock with slightly larger numbers. This is fine, but not from across the room.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality sound, poor instructions, almost impossible to get set up correctly. Not at all worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I had a white one that I bought nearly 20 years ago.  I listened to the ocean waves each night and after 20 years, I got so used to it if I didn&#x27;t have it on, things didn&#x27;t seem right!  The old one was starting to malfunction, and so I looked for a replacement, and settled on this one which is basically an exact copy of the one I had (except black).  So for me.. I am extremely happy as it is an exact replacement.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my college age daughter who hates regular alarms, this alarm-radio has unique sounds built in that make waking more interesting.  You can also wake to the radio.  It&#x27;s easy to use, and the sounds are pretty good digitized copies of nature.  I should have bought one for me.</li>
    <li> Box looked like it sat in someone&#x27;s basement for a couple of years, Light dust on product itself (although inside plastic bag within outer boxing), several permanent surface scratches on face of product, switch to radio doesn&#x27;t work - only get nature sounds, poor quality speaker. Not worth the money I paid.</li>
    <li> horrible, poorly made, clock not working upon arrival, knobs don&#x27;t work correctly...go to walmart and buy the clock radio sound machine that has a timer and continuous sound for $30.</li>
    <li> The display is hard to see, especially at night, but it&#x27;s not landing-strip bright. The battery case won&#x27;t stay on if you have 3 AA&#x27;s in place. You must have a AAA battery for this to work. The sounds are OK, and the controls are pretty intuitive. It&#x27;s a bit big, but hopefully I&#x27;ll get at least a year&#x27;s use out of it.</li>
    <li> I have had the radio since Dec 8th and a week ago it started going off and then on and then off again and then on again.  It looks like something is wrong with the on/off switch.  Since this is a low cost item, it would probably cost me just as much to send it back.  I am now believing that I should buy at home and not online.  I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I am on amazon to purchase another Homedics sound spa alarm clock.  I received one for a gift many years ago and it lasted probably 7-8 years.  It worked well for me and I am planning to buy another because I miss it!</li>
    <li> It is not only difficult to set this it is made very flimsy. The back propping it broke immediately and the clock fell. Fortunately it did not break the closck but I have to use gorilla tape and super glue to keep the stand on. Setting the alarm is also not easy. I would not recommend this product. you get what you pay for but this subquality</li>
    <li> Thank you for quick shipment! I love this clock.</li>
