      <li>I&#x27;m duly impressed.</li>
      <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll be really happy you did!</li>
      <li>Works great!!!</li>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>It provides a wonderful, non-toxic means of removing eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>This is the BEST eye makeup remover that I have used in 20 years~&lt;br /&gt;Removes everything - no fuss, not drying, no film residue and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
      <li>This stuff is great!</li>
      <li>Of course, I use an awesome waterproof mascara (tarte) that won&#x27;t come off while swimming.  </li>
      <li>and it works perfect for me.</li>
      <li>However, I find it is excellent for removing smears, raccoon eye, and make up residue.</li>
      <li>it is wonderful.</li>
      <li>It is excellent.  </li>
      <li>and my eyes are happy campers!  </li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s probably great at taking off eyeshadow (if you wear it).</li>
      <li>Great Product</li>
      <li>This eye makeup remover is great at removing all traces of eye makeup without drying out the skin.</li>
      <li>Great.</li>
      <li>I was apprehensive about trying it after reading some reviews, but it works great for me.</li>
      <li>Great price for an eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t feel drying or oily.  </li>
      <li>It does a great job washing off eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>This is a great product.</li>
      <li>Believe it says to use on cotton pad, but it doesn&#x27;t work all that great when used in that way.....</li>
      <li>This is a very nice eye makeup remover.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really effective!</li>
      <li>I am pleased to say that I am very happy with this product from Earth Science.</li>
      <li>Thank you for making the product I can use and feel good about.</li>
      <li>That was good-</li>
      <li>Well the no burning part works.. but the removal of the makeup.. not so good.</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
      <li>Plentiful, good price, soothing, and hopefully safer ingredients.</li>
      <li>Love this gel!  </li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>so that&#x27;s even better!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I found this product and it is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a gel cleanser that&#x27;s crazily effective as an oil cleanser or creamy milky cleanser</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update this review again if I find a way to effectively use it without getting bits of mascara, etc.</li>
      <li>and they are both effective, but... burns my eyes.</li>
      <li>It is 100% effective.</li>
      <li>Just love it and want those who also have struggled with finding a good remover to find relief.</li>
      <li>I have been searching for the perfect natural eye makeup remover and this is it!!</li>
      <li>This is the most effective makeup remover I have every used.</li>
      <li>This by far is the best- one swipe is all it takes.</li>
      <li>It makes me happy that it is all natural and good for my skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve stayed away from liquid eye makeup remover but the gel format sounded interesting.  </li>
      <li>If you just wipe it over the eye you are relying mostly on the wipe motion to remove the makeup not on the remover itself.</li>
      <li>Love it...</li>
      <li>I love this eye make up remover.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this purchase and will buy again when I run out unless I can find it somewhere locally.</li>
      <li>I truly love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>I just prefer more creamy texture than jelly one.</li>
      <li>and I was able to get most of it off with this makeup</li>
      <li>It makes me feel better knowing that I&#x27;m putting an all-natural product on my face.  </li>
      <li>It seems that every reviewer has a preferred technique for this gel--I fell in love after using it with cotton balls.</li>
      <li>If I use it on my waterproof mascara, it mostly does the job but also creates clumps of goop on my face.</li>
      <li>Great make-up remover, I use it all over my whole face.  </li>
      <li>The price on amazon is better than @</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS MAKEUP REMOVER.</li>
      <li>These are much better than wipes as well because it does not rash or irritate the skin.</li>
      <li>I love it and will be buying again.</li>
      <li>I think it would be easier to use if it were a more liquid formulation.</li>
      <li>Well it is not the one I really love, but still cleaning and removing purposes are working.</li>
      <li>Maybe gel removers require a greater learning curve, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
      <li>It felt ok in the store, it took quite a while to remove all of my makeup thoroughly though.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup very often, but when I do, this is great stuff to have on hand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many types of remover to take off my eye makeup over the years — premoistened pads, oils, gels, etc.</li>
      <li>Leaves my eye area feeling very clean.</li>
      <li>Stays cool, which will be nice in summer.</li>
      <li>Great natural eye makeup remover</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a better Make-Up Remover alternative since it is free of harmful chemicals that damage the skin...</li>
      <li>It gets EVERYTHING off easily, including water-proof makeup, and leaves your face feeling simply CLEAN!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and gets eye make up off easily.</li>
      <li>had Dior Show Waterproof mascara which is really strong stuff</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d originally tried it with cotton pads, based on another review, but I found that the gel was more prone to squish into my eyes that way and the makeup did not come off as cleanly.</li>
      <li>It removes most eye makeup easily, its not oily or greasy and it does calm the skin around the eyes since it contains calming ingredients.</li>
      <li>Its non-irritating, more natural than most eye makeup removers out there and it works!</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a more economical replacement to my Caudalie cleansing water.</li>
      <li>This eyemakeup remover is gentle, thorough, non-greasy, non-smelly, and totally effective.  </li>
      <li>With my Caudalie cleanser, I rarely ever use more than one cotton pad.</li>
      <li>Gentle and effective.</li>
      <li>I used it off and on for a couple years, but now w/ Amazon&#x27;s GREAT price, it&#x27;s the only one I choose!</li>
      <li>Anyway...for those of you that absolutely love this remover, i&#x27;m willing to sell it for $1 + s&amp;h.</li>
      <li>Nice formula, very mild and gentle- does the job of removing your makeup pretty well.</li>
      <li>Rinses squeaky clean without tightness and nary a speck of makeup.</li>
      <li>and I have very sensitive eyes, and this feels amazing</li>
      <li>+ Definitely gentle, I love the ingredients</li>
      <li>I see that another reviewer mentions that this will not take off waterproof mascara, that is true.</li>
      <li>Gentle for the eye area, love the consistency.</li>
      <li>I love that this stuff has gentle ingredients and no parabens, yet it works well.</li>
      <li>All true.  </li>
      <li>Earth Science has quickly become one of my favorite brands, as their products are consistently high quality and effective for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It does work quickly and does not bother eyes.  </li>
      <li>I bought a couple bottles of this on clearance at a local health food a while ago and  love it - I came on Amazon to see if I could get a better price here.  </li>
      <li>It comes out of the bottle really quickly and has the consistancy of a liquidy gel.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It is very gentle, yet does what it is supposed to do!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff and pretty much swear by it.</li>
      <li>Love it, all natural and gets eye make up off with no stinging!</li>
      <li>It is so gentle, so soothing, and removes even waterproof mascara (I don&#x27;t know how!!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Finally!  I have been searching for the perfect natural eye makeup remover and this is it!! I have tried several brands including Jason Quick Clean Makeup Remover Pads (burns my eyes) and The Body Shop Camomile Gentle Eye Makeup Remover (burns my eyes) and they are both effective, but... burns my eyes. Earth Science Chamomile &amp; Green Tea Eye Makeup Remover  does not burn my eyes.. or skin. It&#x27;s soothing AND removes my waterproof mascara!!  I absolutely love it and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup very often, but when I do, this is great stuff to have on hand. It&#x27;s the only natural brand eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve tried, and I purchased it after researching several options. It seems that every reviewer has a preferred technique for this gel--I fell in love after using it with cotton balls. I&#x27;d originally tried it with cotton pads, based on another review, but I found that the gel was more prone to squish into my eyes that way and the makeup did not come off as cleanly. As another reviewer mentioned, this will take off all your face makeup, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for. Earth Science has quickly become one of my favorite brands, as their products are consistently high quality and effective for me and my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I really like this product and continue to repurchase. Its non-irritating, more natural than most eye makeup removers out there and it works!</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eye makeup remover that I have used in 20 years~&lt;br /&gt;Removes everything - no fuss, not drying, no film residue and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, of course, rinse!</li>
    <li> I scanned other reviews for this product hoping to find anyone who mentioned whether it was effective at removing waterpoof mascara.  Everyone says it&#x27;s \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; and \\&quot;non greasy\\&quot; and \\&quot;non irritating\\&quot;, etc.  All true.  BUT if doesn&#x27;t even come close to removing my mascara....doesn&#x27;t even make it smudge.  Of course, I use an awesome waterproof mascara (tarte) that won&#x27;t come off while swimming.  So I was looking for a remover that could tackle that job - and this one couldn&#x27;t.  I do agree that it&#x27;s gentle, non irritating, etc.  And it&#x27;s probably great at taking off eyeshadow (if you wear it).</li>
    <li> Plentiful, good price, soothing, and hopefully safer ingredients. Removes eye makeup well. Stays cool, which will be nice in summer.</li>
    <li> I use this remover for a few years now, occasionally try other brands and come back to this one. It is very gentle, no harsh chemicals, feels refreshing on eyelids and won&#x27;t dry delicate skin around eyes.  I do not use it for waterproof products removal - you need heavy duty chemicals to remove heavy duty chemicals, for everything else it is wonderful. Thank you for making the product I can use and feel good about.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY eye makeup remover that takes off my makeup and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes. Other&#x27;s I have tried are too oily, or too liquid. A big bonus that its all natural.</li>
    <li> Nice formula, very mild and gentle- does the job of removing your makeup pretty well. Just put on a cotton ball and you&#x27;re good to go</li>
    <li> It removes my eye shadow and liner gently and quickly without stinging. It is excellent.  First, remember to spread it out EVENLY on a no-lint cotton pad. I did not do so first, and too much gel went into one area of eyes. It is a clear, very gentle, non-irritating, no-flagrance gel that glides on your eyelids. It is 100% effective. I don&#x27;t wear mascara so cannot comment on that. I highly recommend it. I did not buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve discovered this product at Whole Foods a couple of years ago while looking for a non-chemical eye makeup remover.  I was noticing that the chemicals contained in the drugstore brand products were causing my eye area to age faster, especially since I would use a makeup remover at least twice a day. Also, the oil-free remover I was using (quite expensive one) felt too dry and was pulling on the delicate eye skin which also contributes to the premature skin aging.  After using this product though, I noticed a big improvement. The skin around my eyes feels so nourished every time I use it, and it does not get pulled at all. It makes me feel better knowing that I&#x27;m putting an all-natural product on my face.  This makeup remover comes out as a gel, so it takes a little getting used to. You only need a small amount, and it should be spread evenly on the cotton pad. Dipping a cotton swab into it works well too. It does say on the bottle to rinse the skin after applying the makeup remover. If you forget to do it, you will be reminded by the feeling of stickiness around your eyes ;)  Recently I cannot find this product at Whole Foods or Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, so here I am looking for it on here. I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
    <li> LOVE-LOVE-LOVE this product!!!! It doesn&#x27;t sting, it doesn&#x27;t smell, it isn&#x27;t greasy, it doesn&#x27;t run (b/c it&#x27;s a gel) and it&#x27;s really effective! I used it off and on for a couple years, but now w/ Amazon&#x27;s GREAT price, it&#x27;s the only one I choose! Try it - you&#x27;ll be really happy you did!</li>
    <li> I really wanted this eye makeup remover to work because it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals.  However, it does not do a good job at removing makeup and always left some behind, no matter how hard I scrubbed.  It barely removed any mascara at all, and my mascara isn&#x27;t even waterproof.  I could have dealt with some makeup left over, but the fact that it dried my eyes out really bad was a deal-breaker.  I&#x27;m going to try Say Yes to Cucumbers next and hope it works.</li>
    <li> I like it&#x27;s gel texture and how it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes when you put some on a cotton pad/ball and wipe your eyes. I like it&#x27;s gentle ingredients, it does not sting. It takes a little more effort in removing my waterproof liquid eyeliner. In that case, it helps to leave a little on top of the eyeliner for a few seconds and then wipe with a Q-tip (which applies a little more direct pressure than a cotton pad/ball).</li>
    <li> I love this eye make up remover. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue and gets eye make up off easily.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. It doesnt hurt your eye but it does not erase completely.. i have to wipe my eyes several times in order to clean it completely..</li>
    <li> I ordered this online and had never tried it before.  In the past I had tried (and liked) oil-free eye make-up removers, eye make-up remover pads, and oil-based eye make-up removers.  I was in the market for something oil-free when I found this.    This remover is almost like gel.  When I would put it on a cotton ball it would mush around the surface of the cotton and slather across my eye.  It was very difficult to remove and left a weird film over my eyelids.  I had to follow up with a hot wash cloth every time I used this.  I finally gave up and gave it to a friend, and went back to my oil-free solution from the drug store.</li>
    <li> It erases eye makeup very well. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes and I can trust this brand. I re-purchased this three times already. I would say one bottle lasts about 3-4 months if you are using this everyday.</li>
    <li> I like that this is natural, but comes out goopy. If I use it on my waterproof mascara, it mostly does the job but also creates clumps of goop on my face. I&#x27;ve used liquids in the past and prefer those much better.</li>
    <li> It was too watery and did not remove the eye makeup as easily as expected. I would not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is horrible. It hurts my eyes so much. I can&#x27;t even put on make up after using this product since my eyes continuously water after using this. I thought this would be a better Make-Up Remover alternative since it is free of harmful chemicals that damage the skin... but my eyes are very sensitive to the ingredients. I wish I could return it, but I missed my window of opportunity. Too Bad!!</li>
    <li> I bought a couple bottles of this on clearance at a local health food a while ago and  love it - I came on Amazon to see if I could get a better price here.  I wear Physician&#x27;s Formula waterproof mascara and their long-wearing gel/cream eyeliner and this gets it off well with no eye irritation.  I&#x27;ve never used another eye makeup remover so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else, but I find it really easy to get off and just do a quick rinse with cold water afterwards and my eyes are happy campers!  I use a store brand round cotton pads - I only need one to do both eyes.  I&#x27;m buying extra bottles to keep in my different bags (gym, overnight) so that I&#x27;m not without it.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great natural eye makeup remover</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many types of remover to take off my eye makeup over the years — premoistened pads, oils, gels, etc. For the last several years I&#x27;ve been trying to use products that are as natural as possible and don&#x27;t involve testing on animals. I&#x27;ve had problems with some eye makeup removers making my eyes burn or being messy to use (e.g., running down the sides of the bottle, no matter how careful I was, or spraying droplets whenever I pushed the cap closed). I am pleased to say that I am very happy with this product from Earth Science. No stinging eyes, and no messes while using it. And it removes my eye makeup as well as any other product I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this product is a soft gel, so it doesn&#x27;t run all over the place when you turn the bottle up and squeeze it. It does come out pretty quickly when you squeeze, though, so there&#x27;s no need to squeeze hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that I do not wear mascara much these days (in fact, I don&#x27;t wear eye makeup very often at all anymore, since I work from home now), so I don&#x27;t know how well this remover will work as far as taking off mascara. I&#x27;ll revisit this review and edit it accordingly when I&#x27;ve used it to take off mascara.</li>
    <li> I need an eye makeup remover that does not irritate my sensitive eyes and this fits the bill.  It is not oily, but you do need to rinse the product off after using it.  Leaves my eye area feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MAKEUP REMOVER. It is so gentle, so soothing, and removes even waterproof mascara (I don&#x27;t know how!!) (note: I very gently rub my eyelashes and will twist them just slightly, I mean very gently, to work the product into the makeup if needed, works like a charm, and I rinse in the shower, so it&#x27;s thorough). It makes me happy that it is all natural and good for my skin. I would go so far as to say it is contributing to the health of the delicate skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started buying it from a local health food market then they stopped carrying it (WHY??!!) but then I found it even cheaper on Amazon so that&#x27;s even better! I can not be without this product. I truly love, love, love it. Especially for my extremely sensitive skin! :)</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Just removes all kinds of eye makeup and does not burn my eyes like many other makeup removers do.</li>
    <li> It provides a wonderful, non-toxic means of removing eye makeup.  It is very gentle, yet does what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> it does not look like is an eye makeup remover, but an shampoo instead, plus the bottle is not original package, dries the eyes a lot and does not remove the makeup easily</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. Even if it gets into your eyes, it doesn&#x27;t burn...Removes all traces! Great Product</li>
    <li> Love this product! I was apprehensive about trying it after reading some reviews, but it works great for me. My eyes have felt better since using it because they are pretty sensitive. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this gel!  If you have oily skin and you don&#x27;t wear too much make up you will like this item. Sorry I don&#x27;t wear mascara so I&#x27;m not recommending it for mascara removal.  I apply it all over my face and eyes, rub and rinse off with plain water, a little bit goes a long way. Itcleans my face well and yes, it&#x27;s a little drying but I have oily skin and it works perfect for me. Do not irritate my eyes by the way.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for something like this forever.  This eyemakeup remover is gentle, thorough, non-greasy, non-smelly, and totally effective.  A little goes a long way and you don&#x27;t have that nasty film-over-your-eyes effect when you are done.  And no stinging either.  I am planning on buying a whole bunch more because I&#x27;m worried that it&#x27;ll suddenly disappear. It. Is. Great.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It does a great job washing off eye makeup.  I don&#x27;t use waterproof, however, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.  I have sensitive eyelids and i haven&#x27;t had a problem with this at all. I love it and will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This stuff works well.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Bought this for its all natural, SAFE, non-chemical ingredients. It&#x27;s a decent-sized bottle and I think it&#x27;s going to last for a long time. I usually dip Q-tips into it and use to remove eye makeup, but I think it would work well with cotton swabs too.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a more economical replacement to my Caudalie cleansing water. One night in Whole foods, i needed to remove my eye makeup, so I tried this one. It felt ok in the store, it took quite a while to remove all of my makeup thoroughly though. I figured that I had a hard time because I only had tissues to use, not cotton. Nonetheless, I purchased it. Honestly, this remover failed to impress me. I find it very messy, to start. Also, it caused makeup debris to get in my eyes. It eventually did it&#x27;s job, but after way too much effort, and after a couple of cotton pads. With my Caudalie cleanser, I rarely ever use more than one cotton pad. Maybe gel removers require a greater learning curve, and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ll update this review again if I find a way to effectively use it without getting bits of mascara, etc. In my eyes. Oh, I must agree though that it doesn&#x27;t irritate, and is quite soothing though...just messy!  UPDATE Nov 11 2011  I tried to use this remover again this evening--fail! The point of removing the eye makeup is to get from off of the skin and onto the cotton pad moist with solution! Once again, i ended up with mascara and liner in my one eye. I then had to wash out that eye. For the other eye. I just switched back to old faithful. I shouldn&#x27;t have to go through all of this to remove some (not even waterproof!) makeup. Anyway...for those of you that absolutely love this remover, i&#x27;m willing to sell it for $1 + s&amp;h. I&#x27;ve had enough.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> This product really works well. As other reviewers noted, it does help to dab some on a cotton pad and swipe across your eyes. Let it sit for just a few seconds to start breaking down the mascara, and proceed with swiping it off. It really does come off. It&#x27;s not oily at all and has no offensive smells. I really like it!</li>
    <li> I prefer avon&#x27;s make up eye remover. I had to use a few cottons to get my make up off with it.</li>
    <li> My eyes are very sensitive. This is the only eye makeup remover my daughter and I have found that we like. I&#x27;ll go to the ends of the earth to find it. Hope Amazon always carries it and Earth Science never stops making it. Have tried others and always come back to this.</li>
    <li> I have only tried two other eye makeup removers before and found them to not work very well. I felt like I was never fully removing my waterproof mascara and felt like I had perpetual raccoon eyes.  This is a great product. It took off every trace of eye makeup including waterproof mascara, eye shadow and eye liner. It comes out of the bottle really quickly and has the consistancy of a liquidy gel. Doesn&#x27;t have a harsh smell and seems to soothe the eye. Very happy with this purchase and will buy again when I run out unless I can find it somewhere locally.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice eye makeup remover. It does not sting your eyes. It removes most eye makeup easily, its not oily or greasy and it does calm the skin around the eyes since it contains calming ingredients. The formula is in a aloe Vera gel like form. The only downside of this form is that when you squeeze it out, its a bit hard to control the amount. Overall, its a very nicely priced natural eye makeup remover product. Gentle and effective. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to remove my eye makeup without making my eyes burn. Well the no burning part works.. but the removal of the makeup.. not so good. Back to the drawing board.</li>
    <li> Love it...Works great as an eye makeup remover without irritating your eyes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gel cleanser that&#x27;s crazily effective as an oil cleanser or creamy milky cleanser --but doesnt leave any residual. Rinses squeaky clean without tightness and nary a speck of makeup. No need for \\&quot;double cleansing\\&quot;! the secret? The powerful, yet naturally-derived \\&quot;star ingredient\\&quot; of Decyl Glucoside which dissolves everything in its path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The removal process is why i think people are rating this lower-- You have to do it THIS WAY: Emulsify gel all over wet face, massage, and you&#x27;ll see your foundation, eye makeup, liquid liner, even mascara and oil-based lipstick break down into dirty brown rivulets (ewww). Rinse off, and that&#x27;s it! Even my false lashes and lash glue come off with this product. No residual, no weird feeling of having to follow up with another cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are using this the \\&quot;old fashioned way\\&quot; i.e. cotton ball, swiping product all over face, etc\\&quot; then you will not see the product breakdown. This is the worst way to use this product! You MUST use it like a traditional face cleanser - wet face, massage, and rinse. Remember - NO cotton balls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used milky/creamy/oil-based cleansers to breakdown makeup, followed by a foaming cleanser to emulsify and \\&quot;double clean\\&quot;. there is no need for that extra step with this Earth Science product. I&#x27;m duly impressed.</li>
    <li> I love that this stuff has gentle ingredients and no parabens, yet it works well. The only thing that struck me about this is that it is a gel not a liquid as I am used to...</li>
    <li> Love it! Works great!!!</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected and did not remove my eye make up, merely smeared it around even after I had washed most off with soap and water. The consistency was like too and when I first squeezed some out of the bottom it was very off putting just from how thick it is.</li>
    <li> Nice natural makeup remover - a little goes a long way. Does not leave that greasy/oily feeling and takes off even waterproof makeup with scrubbing.</li>
    <li> + Definitely gentle, I love the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a gel (something that is NOT noted on the packaging), so it&#x27;s a little hard to work with, and it&#x27;s gotten into my eyes and stung a few times. I think it would be easier to use if it were a more liquid formulation.</li>
    <li> Great price for an eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t feel drying or oily.  Works well with waterproof mascara.  Found it at whole foods too and they have testers if you want to try it out.</li>
    <li> Does not sting my eyes when I take off eye makeup. of course you don&#x27;t want to get it in your eye if you can help it. No greasy eyelids either!</li>
    <li> I thought it was an oily solution instead of a soapy one. I don&#x27;t like it, but it helps removing the waterproof eye mascara and I have to wash my whole face afterwards to prevent too much going inside my eye.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for years but cannot find it in stores very much anymore. Love it, all natural and gets eye make up off with no stinging!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stayed away from liquid eye makeup remover but the gel format sounded interesting.  It does work quickly and does not bother eyes.  I still have to rub a bit and use cotton pads.  I prefer a cream which is less hard on the eyes.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye maker up remover that I can use! I originally discovered it in the whole body section of Whole Foods a few years ago, and have been hooked ever since. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and wear contact lenses. I dab a bit of this on a cotton round, along with a few drops of water, and it removes all of my eye makeup in a few soft sweeps. I do not wear waterproof mascara, so I cannot comment on that. I can tell you that I&#x27;ve tried all of the brand name drug store eye make up removers and all have made my eyes burn, were oily, or did not remove my make up - just smudged. This eye make up remover is not oily and does not leave a residue, at least not when used with water (which is how I apply it). It has never irritated my eyes. Prior to using this stuff, I got stys in my eyes on occasion, from not having all of my make up removed completely, and now this never happens! I love this stuff and pretty much swear by it. The price on amazon is better than @ Whole foods, so I will continue to buy it here.</li>
    <li> I found that I still had to use vaseline to get the rest of the makeup off my eyes, did not help me.</li>
    <li> I like other Earth Science products but this one stings my eyes.</li>
    <li> Great make-up remover, I use it all over my whole face.  I use it just like face wash and it gets everything off.  No fragrance and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out.</li>
    <li> This eye makeup remover is great at removing all traces of eye makeup without drying out the skin. I do not wear waterproof makeup so I can&#x27;t speak to how well it would remove that, but normal eye makeup it does it&#x27;s job. Gentle for the eye area, love the consistency. I use this on my wet face either in the shower or sink. Believe it says to use on cotton pad, but it doesn&#x27;t work all that great when used in that way.....not sure what &#x27;gel&#x27; eye makeup remover would. But I really like this one and will continue to repurchase. No interest in trying anything else.</li>
    <li> I picked this up originally at Whole Foods after a lady in the beauty section recommended it. I really like it! There are a few tricks to getting great results with this. First I use the cotton round pads instead of cotton balls. I think the cotton balls are not sturdy enough. Second you should put the gel on the pad and then gently press it on your eye and hold for a minute or so while it breaks down your eye makeup. If you just wipe it over the eye you are relying mostly on the wipe motion to remove the makeup not on the remover itself. Which means you are going to end up rubbing your eyes which isn&#x27;t good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had Dior Show Waterproof mascara which is really strong stuff and I was able to get most of it off with this makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I use 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Ultra Lengthening All Natural Mascara, and it comes off very easily with this makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part about this product is that I don&#x27;t get red blotches or clogged pores by my eyes like I do with other eye makeup removers.</li>
    <li> Well it is not the one I really love, but still cleaning and removing purposes are working. But there is nothing bad about it... I just prefer more creamy texture than jelly one. It has jelly texture and clear on color, I prefer creamy texture and white color...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s probably okay if you just use a little powder or something.  I only really use a little tinted moisturizer, shadow, and mascara and that&#x27;s where it gets ugly.  It takes about three cotton pads worth of this stuff to get waterproof mascara off and the gel consistency definitely doesn&#x27;t help.</li>
    <li> I have fairly sensitive eyes and chose this product because it&#x27;s predominantly chemical-free. It gets only 4 stars since I need to use quite a lot for mascara to come off - and I don&#x27;t wear waterproof. An unexpected bonus is that it comes in the form of a cool gel, which is just what I need after a long day. I&#x27;ve found my dark circles have lessened since using this. I&#x27;d buy it again just for that.</li>
    <li> This is the most effective makeup remover I have every used. I have been using this for 5 years now, and always have plenty of bottles stored. It gets EVERYTHING off easily, including water-proof makeup, and leaves your face feeling simply CLEAN! These are much better than wipes as well because it does not rash or irritate the skin. I wish everyone knew about this product!</li>
    <li> Does not irritate my eye like neutrogena does!</li>
    <li> I see that another reviewer mentions that this will not take off waterproof mascara, that is true. Generally this gentle formula does not take off heavy duty make ups. However, I find it is excellent for removing smears, raccoon eye, and make up residue. I use it every morning under my eyes before applying lotion and eye makeup. I also put a little bit on a q-tip to help even out eyeliner. It has kind of an oily feeling, and is a little viscous, but leaves no residue on skin, and leaves skin feeling silky and moisturized. I would recommend this product if you looking for a gentle, natural make up remover. However, there are certainly stronger products out there if you need to remove some serious makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a while now.  It seems less harsh than other eye makeup removers.  It doesn&#x27;t have a weird scent. It works. That&#x27;s about it...</li>
    <li> I have a hard time removing gel eyeliner and mascara. I&#x27;ve tried over 10 different eye makeup removers in the last year alone. This by far is the best- one swipe is all it takes.</li>
    <li> This is THE eye-make up remover. I have used Neutrogena and Nivea..and each caused my eyes to water and burn a bit. I also tried the product at Whole Foods called  No more Tears. And guess what? It did exactly the opposite. So don&#x27;t bother. I also used more expensive but not organic products like Lancome. That was good- but I wanted something natural.&lt;br /&gt;So I found this product and it is AMAZING.  A little goes a long way and I have very sensitive eyes, and this feels amazing and I never got any reactions. I highly recommend it. It is truly a best kept secret and I will go back and buy more. It took me like a year, but i finally found an eye-make up product that is natural, affordable and works like magic- without irritation what-so-ever. No I do not work for the company! Just love it and want those who also have struggled with finding a good remover to find relief.</li>
    <li> This is the only eye make-up remover I&#x27;ll use. It&#x27;s gentle on my eyes and leaves no greasy overlay.  I stock up and always have a replacement on hand.</li>
