      <li>one of my favorite perfumes</li>
      <li>I bought it because I love Eden</li>
      <li>I love this perfume, I have alergies</li>
      <li>I have lou lou by cacharel for many years, and I have received many compliments</li>
      <li>Very unique</li>
      <li>The bottle is genuine and I love the scent - which is why I purchased it.</li>

      <li>It is a very light and clean scent and has a hint of baby power smell.  </li>

      <li>Lou Lou smells warm, exotic and natural.</li>
      <li>The smell is a cheap drugstore chemical  smell.</li>
      <li>Smells just like the original version to me.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s unique</li>
      <li>The scent of Lou Lou is spicy, unique and inviting.</li>

      <li>don&#x27;t love it on myself,but if i get pass the initial top notes I like it</li>
      <li>packaged, quick delivery.</li>
      <li>I wore this scent in high school and just rediscovered it - still love it.  </li>
      <li>but it smells like white flowers to me - a very very clean smell :-)</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an intense floral,warm and feminine, quite sweet sweet almost reminishing of somenthing sugary and edible.</li>
      <li>Strong at first but after a while it changes the note and doesn&#x27;t really go well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It is a strong perfume and stays on all day so it can be very overwhelming if you use much (I usually use a lot of perfume)...</li>

      <li>I really appreciated it.</li>
      <li>but I really like it.</li>
      <li>Really displeased.</li>
      <li>Dab very lighty cause it can be overpowering.</li>
      <li>I spend a pretty fair amount of money with Amazon, and I am not happy.</li>
      <li>This is hard to find but I love it!  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re used to high end quality perfumes then pass over this brand.</li>
      <li>its the sexyest scent i have ever smelled in my live and my soon to be wife has never gotten something so luxury or should i say elagent</li>
      <li>That should&#x27;ve been called out very clearly on the product page.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a  long lasting scent and totally unique.</li>
      <li>but this one is on the sweeter side and doesn&#x27;t have that something that will make people WOW.</li>
      <li>The smell is sweet, long lasting, the bottle is plastic, but is well made.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There is no other like it.</li>
      <li>maybe due to it being older.....</li>

<li> Many perfumes today seem to smell very similar - cloying and artificial.</li>
<li> Not overbearing but lasts all day long.  </li>
<li> so i am very limited on what i can wear ,</li>
<li> It is difficult to describe as there is no other scent even similar to it.  </li>
<li> I was shopping for a winter scent,I decided to give Lou Lou a try since Cacherel makes few favorites,including what I consider my signature scent.</li>
<li> but with Lou Lou just a small spray does the trick all day...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not great at describing the scent</li>
<li> The price was too expensive for the size!</li>
<li> very sad......  </li>

    <li> I bought this for nostalgia only. The smell is a cheap drugstore chemical  smell. If you&#x27;re used to high end quality perfumes then pass over this brand.</li>
    <li> I purchased a 1 oz bottle of Cacherel LouLou and received it promptly. The bottle is genuine and I love the scent - which is why I purchased it. Communication from Amazon was excellent as usual and I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The price was too expensive for the size! I was expecting something bigger. The perfume was good though I really liked the smell. Just would not purchase</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not imitation, it&#x27;s original</li>
    <li> I was shopping for a winter scent,I decided to give Lou Lou a try since Cacherel makes few favorites,including what I consider my signature scent.Plus the bottle is just wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an intense floral,warm and feminine, quite sweet sweet almost reminishing of somenthing sugary and edible.Dab very lighty cause it can be overpowering. Great sillage and longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love it on myself,but if i get pass the initial top notes I like it</li>

    <li> Really displeased. Should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewer who said this was old. It is. I&#x27;ve bought this for years and know what it should smell like, and this isn&#x27;t it. Then, when I tried to return it, there was no option because it contains alcohol. Well, why is it ok to ship it TO me, but not to receive it FROM me? That should&#x27;ve been called out very clearly on the product page. I would&#x27;ve purchased it somewhere else. I spend a pretty fair amount of money with Amazon, and I am not happy.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the original version to me.  I do wish the fragrance would linger longer.</li>

    <li> This is hard to find but I love it!  Very unique so it&#x27;s not something everyone else is using.  Plan to buy more!</li>
    <li> I have lou lou by cacharel for many years, and I have received many compliments many ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. Is a great purchase for a price I can afford. I love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Best perfume ever made!!!  Been using it since it came out in 1987.</li>
    <li> Strong at first but after a while it changes the note and doesn&#x27;t really go well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but I should have tried it first. I bought it because I love Eden but this one is on the sweeter side and doesn&#x27;t have that something that will make people WOW.</li>
    <li> good, but not Lulu Guinness</li>
    <li> one of my favorite perfumes</li>

    <li> This is my favorite perfume in the world and I am glad I can still buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite.  Not overbearing but lasts all day long.  I receive compliments all of the time on it&#x27;s unique scent.&lt;br /&gt;Well packaged, quick delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Wore this in my teens and loved it...either they changed the formulation or my chemistry changed.  Anyway the company was great and refunded my purchase painlessly. I really appreciated it.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Loulou since 1990. It is my signature fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just so grateful that I can still get it years after they stopped making it.&lt;br /&gt;There is no other like it.</li>
    <li> Just doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I remember 20 years ago ;(</li>
    <li> Good quality, fast delivery. The smell is sweet, long lasting, the bottle is plastic, but is well made. Very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this perfume....1st found it 22 years ago on my honeymoon.....followed a lady and her &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, and asked her what it was....lol....  so then it was discontinued. I then found it online...read the reviews...and I remember reading one lady saying that the scent doesn&#x27;t last very long....maybe due to it being older.....sorry to say, I love this smell, but I feel the scent doesn&#x27;t last all day either.....  very sad......  But I will still wear it.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend wears this and I buy it for her, but  also keep a bottle at my house so that I can spray the pillows of my bed when she is not around.</li>
    <li> Item was as described shipping was quick the gift was appreciated</li>
    <li> Una excelente fragancia que ha sido la preferida por generaciones. Definitivamente la recomendar&amp;iacute;a a todas aquellas personas que buscan un aroma fresco, sea para ellas o para regalar.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, I have alergies so i am very limited on what i can wear ,&lt;br /&gt;This is a fresh light scent. I would recommend this to my friends &amp; family.</li>
