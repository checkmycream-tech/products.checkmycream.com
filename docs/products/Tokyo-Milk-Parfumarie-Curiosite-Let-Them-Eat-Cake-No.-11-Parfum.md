      <li>Also love this perfume.</li>
      <li>I love their products.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite parfume.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite fragrance</li>
      <li>I love sweet scents - this has lovely vanilla overtones.  </li>
      <li>aka Let Them Eat Cake - is my absolute favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>It smells like cheap drug store vanilla spray.</li>
      <li>If you enjoy dessert smelling things, this is the perfume for you.</li>
      <li>I gave this a one star, as the item I received was NOT the genuine thing.  </li>
      <li>so I was really excited when I got it in the mail.</li>
      <li>At first spray i did not really care for the product, but as it meshed with my skin &amp; cloths it started smelling very nice!</li>
      <li>I bough my original bottle in a botique for $38.  </li>
      <li>sure to get the real thing, and you&#x27;ll likely be happy with it.  </li>
      <li>it has such a nice blend of other scents that compliment the Vanilla wonderfully.</li>
      <li>While it does smell kinda like a vanilla dessert, it also has light floral tones which keeps the sweet from being too sweet.</li>
      <li>thank you Tokyo Mild for making such an amazing product!</li>
      <li>so I was super excited to find it here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Its worth the 30 for the genuine product at TokyoMilk&#x27;s website: http://www.tokyo-milk.com/t/parfum</li>
      <li>Fades quickly.</li>
      <li>If you love vanilla with a new twist this is the way to go.</li>
      <li>Unique scents in a pretty bottle.</li>
      <li>I am super sensitive to most perfumes, but this offered the right balance.  </li>
      <li>like fresh baked cake.</li>
      <li>When it is the genuine parfume, I love it for daily use as I am usually extremely sensitive/allergic to most scents, and this one is rich but not overpowering at all.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I got 2 bottles and will deff be back to order more.</li>
      <li>I first bought this perfume from La Costa Resort &amp; Spa in La Costa, CA.  </li>
      <li>It has a hint of sweet and sugary in the beginning and a very fresh and clean note blossoms with a little time.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I still have some left in my first bottle, that I could compare this concoction to.</li>
      <li>This is not the real product.</li>
      <li>Very nic scent...</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll make remarks like \\&quot;something smells really</li>
      <li>While real Tokyo Milk scents stay with you all day.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I like this as much as my $90 perfumes.  </li>
      <li>The color of the parfume is more yellow than my other Tokyo Milk scents and the scent dissipates quickly.</li>
      <li>First, all TokyoMilk parfums are clear.</li>
      <li>Tokyo Milk is one of my favorite perfumes hands down.  </li>
      <li>Also they have a new \\&quot; Noir\\&quot; line I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different Tokyo Milk scents and &amp;#34;Honey &amp; the Moon&amp;#34; is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>photo-Yellowy Item on right was from Amazon vendor, clear bottle on left was genuine item found at local store...</li>
      <li>It really is reminiscent of freshly baked cake.</li>
      <li>I love the smell but this does not last long after you spray it on</li>
      <li>I am sure I will be reordering, I don&#x27;t think my bottle will last very long.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Also, because it&#x27;s a light scent, it can be layered with other perfumes or essential oils to take it from a day to evening fragrance.</li>
      <li>it is also more subtle and doesn&#x27;t smack you in the face with an artificual</li>
      <li>I am familiar with this fragrance, and the bottle I received did not smell the way it should - as if the product was old or not authentic.</li>
      <li>Next time I will just buy directly from Tokyo Milk!</li>
      <li>The fragrance is delicate, light, airy, and undeniably feminine.</li>
      <li>Sorry it just wasn&#x27;t for me but to each his own.</li>
      <li>them eat cake&amp;#34; is medium tone level; not too strong, and not too weak.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell like cake...but has a subtle sweet scent to it.  </li>

<li> I am unable to wear any designer perfume</li>
<li> I wish Sephora had this in stock :(</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Awesome!!  Love it!!  I am unable to wear any designer perfume but I can wear this with no problems.</li>
    <li> Takes a few tries to actually get the perfume out, and when it does it just leaks out, no spritzing.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. .  Would definitely repurchase</li>
    <li> At first spray i did not really care for the product, but as it meshed with my skin &amp; cloths it started smelling very nice! My best friend told me i smelled wonderful when i went out on the night of her birthday! If you enjoy dessert smelling things, this is the perfume for you. I was going to return it but changed my mind last minute. Perfumes do change scent after the initial fumes wear off!</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like cake. Fades quickly. Will never repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is the cheapest I have seen Tokyo milk perfume!  I bough my original bottle in a botique for $38.  I love their products. I bought the matching lotion. It is a complex scent sugar cane, coconut milk, vanilla orchid,  and white musk.  It kinda smells like bath and bodyworks warm vanilla sugar.. without all the fake smells... it is also more subtle and doesn&#x27;t smack you in the face with an artificual scent.&lt;br /&gt;. Its awesome.  I like this as much as my $90 perfumes.  It wears nicley, but doesn&#x27;t  wear off. Highly recommend! Also they have a new \\&quot; Noir\\&quot; line I can&#x27;t wait to try!</li>
    <li> This, No. 11 aka Let Them Eat Cake - is my absolute favorite perfume! It has a hint of sweet and sugary in the beginning and a very fresh and clean note blossoms with a little time. I will drive to the ends of the earth for this stuff! I wish Sephora had this in stock :( I am able to get this at Boutiques from time to time. I also recommend the cream that goes with this. I hope they never discontinue this!!!!</li>
    <li> Besides the fact that it arrived open.It does not last. I have worn this before and it seemed to last. Not the case this time.</li>
    <li> Half of the product had leaked out of the bottle during shipping. I am familiar with this fragrance, and the bottle I received did not smell the way it should - as if the product was old or not authentic.</li>
    <li> Really really love Tokyo Milk. Also love this perfume. It&#x27;s a perfect day scent for me. While it does smell kinda like a vanilla dessert, it also has light floral tones which keeps the sweet from being too sweet. Also, because it&#x27;s a light scent, it can be layered with other perfumes or essential oils to take it from a day to evening fragrance. The scent lasts for a long time and isn&#x27;t overpowering. It also doesn&#x27;t smell like fake dessert like a lot of bath and body works or yankee candle dessert style fragrances do because they have a chemical undertone.</li>
    <li> let them eat cake is like a better quality version of warm vanilla sugar from bath and body works :)</li>
    <li> I love the smell but this does not last long after you spray it on</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with my recent purchase of Tokyo Milk from the seller Lucca.  The package came today and it was not in a perfume box which I thought was a bit odd.  The perfume has a yellow tint to it.  It has a hint of alcohol in it. It doesn&#x27;t smell like other Tokyo Milk perfume&#x27;s I have gotten in the past.  I wanted to return it, but the seller Lucca does not accept returns on this perfume.</li>
    <li> It definitely smells like birthday cake and I notice I can wear it at work and the people bothered by scent aren&#x27;t bothered by it and a few really like it.</li>
    <li> I saw a really good review on this perfume and thought it sounded like it would smell fabulous so I was really excited when I got it in the mail. However, when I tried it out it was the most overpowering, sickening sweet, almost medicinal smelling crap I have ever tried in my life. It&#x27;s one of those scents that just gets stuck in your nose and you smell it for hours and hours afterwards. Ugh!!! Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very nic scent...like fresh baked cake.</li>
    <li> It was to my surprise that this product smelled nothing like cake. It smells like cheap drug store vanilla spray. Sorry it just wasn&#x27;t for me but to each his own.</li>
    <li> Lovely sent!! I get compliments every time I wear it! The bottle seems to travel nicely in my bag. I will re-buy it when it&#x27;s gone:)</li>
    <li> First, all TokyoMilk parfums are clear. Mine arrived with a yellow tint, I knew without even opening the bottle that something was wrong. When I smelled it it smelled more of alcohol and not the wonderful vanilla-musky smell that TokyoMilk&#x27;s Let them Eat Cake is known for.  It seems as if someone was trying to dilute the parfum. Fortunately I still have some left in my first bottle, that I could compare this concoction to. Congrats LUCCA - you ripped me off on this, but I learned my lesson. Its worth the 30 for the genuine product at TokyoMilk&#x27;s website: http://www.tokyo-milk.com/t/parfum</li>
    <li> I gave this a one star, as the item I received was NOT the genuine thing.  When it is the genuine parfume, I love it for daily use as I am usually extremely sensitive/allergic to most scents, and this one is rich but not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to get the real thing, and you&#x27;ll likely be happy with it.  See photo-Yellowy Item on right was from Amazon vendor, clear bottle on left was genuine item found at local store...very different scent and color.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite parfume. The scent is like none I have ever had before. It is so hard to find in stores so I was super excited to find it here on Amazon. I got 2 bottles and will deff be back to order more. You cant beat the price. I buy tons of department store parfumes and will probably stick to this brand and scent from now on. If you love vanilla with a new twist this is the way to go. it has such a nice blend of other scents that compliment the Vanilla wonderfully. thank you Tokyo Mild for making such an amazing product!</li>
    <li> What a perfect name for this fragrance! It really is reminiscent of freshly baked cake. Although it&#x27;s sweet, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;sickly sweet\\&quot; if you get my meaning. It&#x27;s also not overpowering. For me, this is very important as a lot of perfumes literally give me a headache. The fragrance is delicate, light, airy, and undeniably feminine. I have gotten quite a few compliments on this scent, from both sexes no less! People wonder if I&#x27;m actually wearing a fragrance as this is so sheer, and not perfumy at all. They&#x27;ll make remarks like \\&quot;something smells really good\\&quot;. It&#x27;s one I wear most often because of how good it makes me feel.</li>
    <li> I first bought this perfume from La Costa Resort &amp; Spa in La Costa, CA.  I loved the scent!  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily smell like cake...but has a subtle sweet scent to it.  I am super sensitive to most perfumes, but this offered the right balance.  So happy to have found this on Amazon, as I no longer have to pay spa prices!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance</li>
    <li> it smells soooo good, just like cake!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I love this product line.  This &amp;#34;let them eat cake&amp;#34; is medium tone level; not too strong, and not too weak.  It smells great.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and although it took a little longer than I anticipated for it to arrive, when it did arrive I was pleasantly surprised. The scent is not too strong and smells soooo good. I am sure I will be reordering, I don&#x27;t think my bottle will last very long.</li>
    <li> This is not the real product. I have bought Tokyo Milk parfumes from Tokyo Milk and at stores. The color of the parfume is more yellow than my other Tokyo Milk scents and the scent dissipates quickly. While real Tokyo Milk scents stay with you all day. Next time I will just buy directly from Tokyo Milk!</li>
    <li> I beyond love the scent, unfortunately the bottle it came in was defective and srays everywhere when I try to use it .</li>
    <li> This was a Birthday gift for my wife. She loved it. The price was great. Very happy all around. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Tokyo Milk is one of my favorite perfumes hands down.  Unique scents in a pretty bottle. When I&#x27;m finished with the perfume its hard to throw away the bottle!  I love sweet scents - this has lovely vanilla overtones.  I&#x27;ve tried several different Tokyo Milk scents and &amp;#34;Honey &amp; the Moon&amp;#34; is my favorite.  Let Them Eat Cake is a close second!  Seller sent product in a timely fashion - no problems at all!</li>
