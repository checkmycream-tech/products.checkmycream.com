      <li>I love the Loofah Sponge (6) Pack Scrubber Glove from Beverly Hills Beauty Supply.</li>
      <li>It is a fantastic product that I do not hesitate recommending!</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m going to exfoliate, I want to be able to feel the loofah is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>glad I got 6, I can share with my husband, and take on vacation.</li>
      <li>I love the Loofah Sponges.</li>
      <li>With the curve it makes washing require more pressure applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I purchased at same time is perfect at exfoliating.</li>
      <li>, I would have made the loofah thinner and consequently more prone to flexing.</li>
      <li>I love these loofah sponges and use them every tie I take a bath.</li>
      <li>love these loofah&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Love that they come in a 6 pack</li>
      <li>They work okay.</li>
      <li>These are pretty good.</li>
      <li>I am still on my first one which has stayed clean and in great shape for over a month.</li>
      <li>Soap lathers up nicely and the sponge is just the right consistency, not too abrasive.</li>
      <li>Nice that they are large.</li>
      <li>Great product, especially for the price.</li>
      <li>Although they were relatively cheap, I cannot recommend them.</li>
      <li>The scrub part is great but the elastic on the back deteriorates in a blink of an eye.</li>
      <li>They have a nice texture and they really lather well.</li>
      <li>I have made many purchases from this same company and have loved them all.  </li>
      <li>They keep my clean and stimulated.</li>
      <li>But it does scrub you clean.</li>
      <li>Great as part of a weekly skin regime to keep it smooth and toned (with use of other products).</li>
      <li>They leave my skin feeling energized and super clean without scratching.</li>
      <li>After I am done my skin feels super clean and exfoliated.</li>
      <li>At first I worried that they were too large but as soon as they were wet they conformed perfectly to my hand.</li>
      <li>They fall apart so quick.</li>
      <li>I have purchased better quality, more abrasive loofah scrubbers from local merchants.</li>
      <li>I like and deteriorated quickly.</li>
      <li>Very gentle, very lightweight, easy to lather up, and easy to rinse excess soap from the scrub.  </li>
      <li>I like these loofahs very much!</li>
      <li>These looters are a nice big size for using in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It feels nice when using, but it&#x27;s obvious</li>
      <li>Great to use if you are using tanning products as it will take off the dead skin that will be dry and prevent the tanning product from applying nice and even.</li>
      <li>They are less effective at soaping up like a regular loofah, as the sponge soaks up most of the body wash and you have to use more than you normally would.</li>
      <li>They are more coarse than others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>After I am done my skin feels tingly clean and baby soft.  </li>
      <li>The strap on the back makes it easy to keep the sponge in place on your hand while bathing.  </li>
      <li>6 large loofahs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I prefer it because it really exfoliates my skin.</li>
      <li>The generous 5x7 size of this loofah scrubber glove makes it so much faster to exfoliate my skin.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I then use the loofah to gently exfoliate my skin.  </li>
      <li>This one never did no matter how much I tried to get it to loosen up.  </li>
      <li>Using a shower gel, they don&#x27;t hold that much</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the 6 pack lasting only six weeks though, these are effective at exfoliating.</li>
      <li>While the loofah feels hard and scratchy when you first open the package, once wet it has the perfect texture to give you luxurious smooth and soft skin with minimum effort.  </li>
      <li>I used a little soap with it and my entire body feels clean and very smooth.</li>
      <li>I feel a regular bath sponge actually does a better job exfoliating.  </li>
      <li>Definitely a decent version of a loofah pad</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Turns out, it works even better - the dead skin is scrubbed off and my skin feels smoother than it ever has!</li>
      <li>They start to just fall out in chunks and my first one didn&#x27;t last longer than 3 weeks.</li>
      <li>When my wife bought me a loofah sponge to try out I was less than excited.</li>
      <li>In the grand scheme, it is hard for me to find a sturdy loofah for I do NOT like soft loofah for my body.</li>
      <li>but so far that has not happened.</li>
      <li>Enough for the whole family and still have replacements.  </li>
      <li>(mine came with 6) as soon as this one gets soft or rips up or anything</li>
      <li>Not exactly what I expected but they are ok.  </li>
      <li>Better than the synthetics but not exceptional</li>
      <li>Mainly because this is a simple product and it was well assembled.</li>
      <li>I blame myself for only reading the main &amp;#34;Most Helpful&amp;#34; reviews.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> love these loofah&#x27;s. My skin is softer than ever,. glad I got 6, I can share with my husband, and take on vacation.</li>
    <li> Did not care for these. Way to rough and could not get soap to lather well.</li>
    <li> Somewhat flimsy during use. Sometimes balls up or folds over itself.</li>
    <li> Love these!  The strap on the back makes it easy to keep the sponge in place on your hand while bathing.  Excellent for exfoliation without the added chemicals and perfumes of most exfoliation products.</li>
    <li> I blame myself for only reading the main &amp;#34;Most Helpful&amp;#34; reviews. If you look at Recent customer reviews, there&#x27;s a big difference in opinion. I was hoping to get a good scrubber for exfoliating my body. It feels nice when using, but it&#x27;s obvious that&#x27;s it is NOT &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; or scrubbing as advertised. If you want something to apply soap/body wash with, then this works well (hence the 2 stars). Otherwise, as an exfoliator/scrubber look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comparison, the Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber I purchased at same time is perfect at exfoliating. Too bad I can only really use it for my back.</li>
    <li> Too big for the average hand and it curls outward (which makes you constantly trying to hold onto it).  Although they were relatively cheap, I cannot recommend them.</li>
    <li> Much too stiff.  Not at all to my liking.  Loofah&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had in the past started out stiff but softened up a little.  This one never did no matter how much I tried to get it to loosen up.  I threw all 6 of mine in the trash.  Made in China.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> Very low quality. Had to return it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> The are also great for travel.</li>
    <li> I have made many purchases from this same company and have loved them all.  The generous size of this loofah makes it such that I can exfoliate my skin in record time, which is appreciated especially during morning rush-showers.  While the loofah feels hard and scratchy when you first open the package, once wet it has the perfect texture to give you luxurious smooth and soft skin with minimum effort.  I usually make the loofah wet and apply some soft soap to my skin while showering.  I then use the loofah to gently exfoliate my skin.  After I am done my skin feels tingly clean and baby soft.  LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled I was able to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.  It is a fantastic product that I do not hesitate recommending!</li>
    <li> These are not great. They are hard to use, don&#x27;t soften up at all, and don&#x27;t feel very exfoliating either. Disappointed with the purchase after using just one several times.</li>
    <li> Perfect size for the shower.  Seems to hold together well around the edges.  I&#x27;d buy these again!</li>
    <li> Thank they great for what I needed  them for!</li>
    <li> I have had dry skin for as long as I can remember and I always hated showing off my arms. I purchased these sponges a month ago and they have drastically changed the condition of my skin! Soap lathers up nicely and the sponge is just the right consistency, not too abrasive. I thought it was a bargain to get a 6 pack and I will continue to purchase these in the future!</li>
    <li> I love the Loofah Sponge (6) Pack Scrubber Glove from Beverly Hills Beauty Supply. I have made many purchases from this company and have loved all of my items. The generous 5x7 size of this loofah scrubber glove makes it so much faster to exfoliate my skin. When you get the loofah it will feel hard and rough, but, when wet it has just the right texture to give you luxurious smooth and soft skin with little effort. I get the loofah wet and apply body wash on it while showering then use the loofah to gently exfoliate my skin. After I am done my skin feels super clean and exfoliated. Great to use if you are using tanning products as it will take off the dead skin that will be dry and prevent the tanning product from applying nice and even. This is my honest opinion after trying this product.</li>
    <li> Not very flexible and the soap does not go inside it. But it does scrub you clean. A little to rough for my likes.</li>
    <li> When my wife bought me a loofah sponge to try out I was less than excited. I&#x27;ve spent my whole life showering as a &#x27;soap and shampoo, towel off and go&#x27; type person. Now, after two weeks using this loofah, my skin has lost its rough dry patches and feels cleaner than ever. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll shower without a loofah again.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this firm of a loofah before - I used very soft ones that lathered up quickly in the past - but it came in the mail the other day and I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Turns out, it works even better - the dead skin is scrubbed off and my skin feels smoother than it ever has! Thanks.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Speedy delivery.</li>
    <li> Felt absolutely wonderful on my skin in the shower.  Very gentle, very lightweight, easy to lather up, and easy to rinse excess soap from the scrub.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> RETURNED&lt;br /&gt;The loofah sponge was so hard and stiff. Unusable!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was great about the return.</li>
    <li> Not the stiff loofah I like and deteriorated quickly. Now sorry I bought 6.</li>
    <li> I feel a regular bath sponge actually does a better job exfoliating.  I wanted to like these, but they just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Too stiff, and don&#x27;t hold the body wash well.</li>
    <li> I got what I paid for. 6 large loofahs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comments on the products:&lt;br /&gt;After wet, they tend to have a permanent curve towards the side of the strap. Also they are rather stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I was to produce said loofahs, I would have made the loofah thinner and consequently more prone to flexing. With the curve it makes washing require more pressure applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality: 5/5&lt;br /&gt;Usability: 3.5-4/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would give 4.5/5 but I am leaning towards 5/5. Mainly because this is a simple product and it was well assembled. If you give anything less than a 4-5/5, you are biased towards the loofah material and are being unfair to the product which utilizes it.</li>
    <li> I tried so many exfoliants and had some results, but this is the cheapest and the best for your perfect skin.</li>
    <li> Better than the synthetics but not exceptional</li>
    <li> Just as expected and work well.  Nice that they are large.</li>
    <li> I purchased these as an alternative to a regular loofah in hopes of having a product that would exfoliate every morning in addition to soaping. They work okay. At first I definitely noticed much smoother skin, but these loofahs as noticeably less effective after a week of use, and almost useless for exfoliating after a couple weeks when they just get gross and warped. If you don&#x27;t mind the 6 pack lasting only six weeks though, these are effective at exfoliating. They are less effective at soaping up like a regular loofah, as the sponge soaks up most of the body wash and you have to use more than you normally would.</li>
    <li> Great as part of a weekly skin regime to keep it smooth and toned (with use of other products). A bit stiff, but I expected that. The roughness is nice.</li>
    <li> The scrub part is great but the elastic on the back deteriorates in a blink of an eye. That really annoyed the heck out of me but you can&#x27;t have it all. In the grand scheme, it is hard for me to find a sturdy loofah for I do NOT like soft loofah for my body. All in all I will keep using this product...I just wish they would get a stronger elastic band!!</li>
    <li> I have purchased better quality, more abrasive loofah scrubbers from local merchants. If I&#x27;m going to exfoliate, I want to be able to feel the loofah is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I don&#x27;t feel these loofahs do a good job. In fact, I think my $2 body pouf from WalMart removes more dead, dry skin than this brand of loofah. Not impressed.</li>
    <li> I like these loofahs very much! I wish they were smaller (hence the four star rating), but I know it probably has to be a one size fits all thing, and not everyone has tiny elf hands like I do. I like these because they are not super rough, and seem to keep a lather pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came as described on the day they were supposed to, and are all individually wrapped. Once I use all six, I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  Love that they come in a 6 pack so I don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>
    <li> Too rough for my taste!</li>
    <li> These are pretty good. They last quite a while. They have a nice texture and they really lather well. They are rough but not too rough. Good  for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> Price is right, great size and product!</li>
    <li> These looters are a nice big size for using in the shower.  They arrived quickly with good packaging.  I would order them again.</li>
    <li> A good price, and no complaints.  It&#x27;s not cushy and it is a little harsh, but it&#x27;s a loofah.  Honestly, I bought it so it would exfoliate and I don&#x27;t mind the &amp;#34;scrubbiness&amp;#34; at all. It dries quickly enough that I can take it on trips and isn&#x27;t sopping wet.</li>
    <li> Loofah is a little flimsy, I&#x27;ll use them BUT I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
    <li> They fall apart so quick. They start to just fall out in chunks and my first one didn&#x27;t last longer than 3 weeks. I am a small thin girl and the only one that uses it so not sure why so poor quality.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first because the pads (they are not gloves) are so flat, but upon wetting one, it puffs up nicely. The purpose of the pad being for exfoliation - it does a great job in that respect. Not too rough or too soft in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;The part that doesn&#x27;t work for me (personal choice) and is not included in the product description (which is not uncommon at Amazon) is that they are made in China. :( Definitely a decent version of a loofah pad and we will use them all, but I will continue to seek out US-made ones for future purchase.</li>
    <li> thin and rough, no thanks</li>
    <li> traditional loofa, but very dry,  It takes a bit of soaking to soften up, but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I love the Loofah Sponges. never used them before &amp; would recommend them to anyone who is on the fence, you won&#x27;t be sorry. They are great.the make your skin feel so good arrive on time, packaging perfect. Would recommend this seller to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Mary Lou Lion :-)</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend since she likes to take care of her skin in a very deep way. I can recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I love these loofah sponges and use them every tie I take a bath. They are more coarse than others I&#x27;ve tried but I prefer it because it really exfoliates my skin. I used a little soap with it and my entire body feels clean and very smooth. It&#x27;s great to use before you shave too. Getting the 6 pack was great too because I gave a couple to my mom.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the shower.  It stays hanging on a hook so it can dry in between use. I use it every time I shower and it has not softened up, which is great as it still gets good use.  I am still on my first one which has stayed clean and in great shape for over a month. I plan on swapping out for the next one (mine came with 6) as soon as this one gets soft or rips up or anything but so far that has not happened. These will last a while.  Great product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Toxic!&lt;br /&gt;These smell like diesel fuel and the smell would not wash out.</li>
    <li> I buy this by the pack - I love them!!!</li>
    <li> Exception  product for a great price.  Enough for the whole family and still have replacements.  If you like quality loofah pads for shower this is it.</li>
    <li> lil stiff until the water hits and then still stiff --- will use it until they are finished --- dont think i will order again</li>
    <li> Love them. At first I worried that they were too large but as soon as they were wet they conformed perfectly to my hand. They leave my skin feeling energized and super clean without scratching.</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected but they are ok.  They are not quite as absorbent as I thought they would be.  Using a shower gel, they don&#x27;t hold that much</li>
    <li> They keep my clean and stimulated.</li>
    <li> Recieved my product on time and happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy for the money. We have been paying over $6 a piece at places like Walmart or Target. These are around $3 a piece and are really good quality.</li>
    <li> They suck. not for bath. possibly a loofah for feet durring a mani, but not for the body.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick ship.  Thank you.</li>
