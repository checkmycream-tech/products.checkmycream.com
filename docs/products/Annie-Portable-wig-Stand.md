      <li>I just loved this wig stand!</li>

      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>The material used for these wig stands is great.  </li>
      <li>the product was great and just like it described on the site  </li>

      <li>my wigs stans are good</li>
      <li>I was very pleased with my purchase...</li>
      <li>Great to fit in luggage when traveling.</li>
      <li>These are so handy for wigs.</li>
      <li>Im very happy with this wig stand, it is light and hold my short wigs perfectly!</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s actually very very easy.</li>
      <li>very easy to put together and take apart.</li>
      <li>but i works just fine!</li>
      <li>Very cheaply made, works though.</li>
      <li>I SO LOVE THIS...</li>
      <li>It’s OK but not for caps.</li>
      <li>SO LOVE THIS</li>
      <li>The problem is that when you insert the top part inside the bottom,the legs on the top don&#x27;t fully touch the surface you&#x27;ve placed it on.</li>
      <li>Over satisfied with the stand</li>
      <li>and it was ok...</li>
      <li>so I needed to safely transport my stands and wigs so that they don&#x27;t damage.</li>
      <li>Well, haha, I should have stuck with the good ole styrofoam wig stands and a nice wig box.</li>
      <li>The open design, I feel, is also the best for storing wigs rather than styrofoam heads as it airs the wig out and doesn&#x27;t end up stretching the cap.</li>
      <li>The top crown price falls off EVERY time I put the wig on and take it off.</li>
      <li>LOOKING FORWARD TO PURCHASING MORE WITH THESE SELLERS HAD DIFFICULTY PUTTING IT TOGETHER</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty good</li>
      <li>Ideal, especially for the money.</li>
      <li>Which made for an easy ease belly.</li>
      <li>It is easy to put together, does not take up space, and does not collapse once it is standing.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put together and take apart for travel.</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
      <li>It kind of wobbles there, so you have to make sure it&#x27;s steady before walking away.</li>
      <li>the plastic is too light and it is easily fall over when i put the wig on there.</li>
      <li>but it doesn’t fit well at all.</li>
      <li>It folds flat, so it&#x27;s great for packing into a suitcase.  </li>
      <li>problem is that long wigs will topple it over, considering that this is a very light weight and skinny stand, but I bought three for my short and medium wigs and they&#x27;re perfect for it.</li>
      <li>It was okay but didn&#x27;t hold my wig very well.</li>
      <li>Its also easy to take apart and take with you wherever you go :&amp;#62; I don&#x27;t know how well it would work with long wigs but for short wigs it is perfect!</li>
      <li>They are easy to put together and pretty sturdy.</li>
      <li>Quick to assemble, quick to take apart</li>
      <li>Definitely buying more when I get more wigs.</li>
      <li>Overall, I am pleased with my purchased and will buy from this seller again, thank you :)</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>Definitely perfect for drying wigs if you&#x27;re washing them, as well as for travel (especially since I go to Anime/Manga conventions, as well as take them on the go sometimes to other states).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Came quickly and are exactly as pictured.</li>
      <li>Not only does this stand fall apart easily, it falls over easily.</li>
      <li>Perfect for short to medium (about down to shoulder blades) sized wigs.</li>
      <li>As they can be taken completely apart and lay down flat, they were absolutely perfect for taking to conventions when my friend and my suitcases were already packed full with our costumes.</li>
      <li>Just what I was looking for, the pictured and described item was exactly what I got.</li>
      <li>it holds my 100 cm wigs very well!</li>
      <li>Not bad of a product but as someone who intentionally paid more thinking I&#x27;d get a white stand, I would not have purchased it for any more $ than the other wig stands out there.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, so make sure you&#x27;re wig isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, looks exactly as described, the wig stand is very sturdy and the price is VERY reasonable.</li>
      <li>It is flexible enough to put together easily from its folded state, and yet strong enough to make it not feel as if it will snap in two.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very touchy</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cause it to fall over.</li>
      <li>Not very sturdy, but did the job okay.</li>
      <li>The cost was reasonable.</li>
      <li>AND IT REALLY KEEPS IT</li>
      <li>For a cheap wig stand, it definitely does its job well.</li>
      <li>It works, but is very unstable.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know much about wigs or stands though.</li>
      <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH...</li>
      <li>shipment was really fast</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t like standing much</li>
      <li>Easy to assemble and makes it easier to dry wig on it and use as permanent stand.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>This stand is easy to put together, a really good size for longer wigs, and not too bad on the price.</li>
      <li>It said it was flexible but really its not and the pieces don&#x27;t exactly fit and broke putting it together but a little glue fixed the problem</li>
      <li>Can lose balance easily if wig is heavy on one side.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have long wigs so it&#x27;ll probably work fine for short wigs as opposed to long ones.</li>
      <li>I had to order 2 because I recently bought new wigs and had no wig stands.</li>
      <li>You can use it as a everyday wig stand, however it does not cover the full wig properly.</li>

<li> the only thing tat it is not really stable.</li>
<li> I expected to receive a white wig holder but instead received a black one.</li>
<li> And now I dont have to display my pink cosplay wig on my lamp shade.xD</li>
<li> Not a whole lot else to write.</li>
<li> This is not what I expected.</li>
<li> I just got this the other day.</li>
<li> other than tat, it is alright.</li>
<li> Just sturdy enough to keep the wigs precariously balanced, but not confidently so.</li>
<li> sturdier than other portable wig stands.  </li>
<li> I prefer to use the foam wig stand for everyday use.</li>
<li> And if I decide to comb the wig on the stand I have to hold the stand firmly in place or it will fall off.</li>
<li> they were portable and I will be moving across the U.S. in a few months</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t assemble it because the pieces are identical and they do not fit together as shown in the instructions.</li>
<li> Waste of money.  </li>
<li> My wig stand was a little stiff when trying to put it together</li>
<li> I did not find it hard to put together.  </li>

    <li> Does the job.  sturdier than other portable wig stands.  I did not find it hard to put together.  Quick to assemble, quick to take apart</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot else to write. It&#x27;s a wig stand. It stands. And holds a wig. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> I SO LOVE THIS...HELPS KEEPS MY WIGS FROM BEING THROWN ON THE TABLE AND GETTING MESSED UP. WHEN I TAKE MY WIG OFF I JUST PUT IT ON THE STAND AND IT REALLY KEEPS IT PRESERVED IN A WAY. THE WIG WON&#x27;T GET TANGLED UP OR ANYTHING. I SO LOVE THIS FOR THE PRICE I PAID TOO!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH...</li>
    <li> I bought 3 stands bc they were portable and I will be moving across the U.S. in a few months so I needed to safely transport my stands and wigs so that they don&#x27;t damage. Well, haha, I should have stuck with the good ole styrofoam wig stands and a nice wig box. Not only does this stand fall apart easily, it falls over easily. The top crown price falls off EVERY time I put the wig on and take it off. And if I decide to comb the wig on the stand I have to hold the stand firmly in place or it will fall off. It&#x27;s very touchy and it doesn&#x27;t take much to cause it to fall over. I have long wigs so it&#x27;ll probably work fine for short wigs as opposed to long ones.</li>
    <li> Bought two of these for the the anime convention season. As they can be taken completely apart and lay down flat, they were absolutely perfect for taking to conventions when my friend and my suitcases were already packed full with our costumes.</li>
    <li> For a cheap wig stand, it definitely does its job well. Perfect for short to medium (about down to shoulder blades) sized wigs. Definitely perfect for drying wigs if you&#x27;re washing them, as well as for travel (especially since I go to Anime/Manga conventions, as well as take them on the go sometimes to other states).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that long wigs will topple it over, considering that this is a very light weight and skinny stand, but I bought three for my short and medium wigs and they&#x27;re perfect for it.</li>
    <li> When i recieved this in the mail, I was a bit confused on how to assemble it. After a couple of minutes of reading over the instructions, it only took about one minute to assemble it without any hitches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;• Easy to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;• Simple Instructions&lt;br /&gt;• Can hold all types of wigs.&lt;br /&gt;• Can be used for styling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;• Can be tricky to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;• Can lose balance easily if wig is heavy on one side.&lt;br /&gt;• Made from plastic</li>
    <li> works great. no problems</li>
    <li> very easy to put together and take apart. sturdy enough as portable  wig stand would purchase same if I needed mors</li>
    <li> It’s OK but not for caps. This is not what I expected. I bought 4 of them for some of my caps but it doesn’t fit well at all.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase...Thank you!</li>
    <li> I just loved this wig stand! The cost was reasonable. I had searched locally for this wig stand and the cost was unreasonable. I use this wig stand for traveling. It is easy to put together, does not take up space, and does not collapse once it is standing.  You can use it as a everyday wig stand, however it does not cover the full wig properly. I prefer to use the foam wig stand for everyday use.</li>
    <li> great product. Excellent delivery</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t like standing much</li>
    <li> my wigs stans are good i like them thank you.i like the color white and ther biger than i thote</li>
    <li> LOOKING FORWARD TO PURCHASING MORE WITH THESE SELLERS HAD DIFFICULTY PUTTING IT TOGETHER BUT I FIGURED IT OUT WORKS WELL</li>
    <li> Ideal, especially for the money. Easy to put together and take apart for travel. I bought three! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light, so make sure you&#x27;re wig isn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with this wig stand, it is light and hold my short wigs perfectly! Its also easy to take apart and take with you wherever you go :&amp;#62; I don&#x27;t know how well it would work with long wigs but for short wigs it is perfect!</li>
    <li> These are so handy for wigs. They are easy to put together and pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> Came quickly and are exactly as pictured. Easy to assemble and makes it easier to dry wig on it and use as permanent stand. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, looks exactly as described, the wig stand is very sturdy and the price is VERY reasonable. My wig stand was a little stiff when trying to put it together so I took a Q-Tip and added 2 drops of oil (or lard) and it was ok... Overall, I am pleased with my purchased and will buy from this seller again, thank you :)</li>
    <li> I just got this the other day. I had to order 2 because I recently bought new wigs and had no wig stands. Unlike the maniquin heads and such that are either really cheap and not too sturdy, or the ones that are really expensive. This stand is easy to put together, a really good size for longer wigs, and not too bad on the price. Definitely buying more when I get more wigs. (:</li>
    <li> The material used for these wig stands is great.  It is flexible enough to put together easily from its folded state, and yet strong enough to make it not feel as if it will snap in two.  It folds flat, so it&#x27;s great for packing into a suitcase.  The open design, I feel, is also the best for storing wigs rather than styrofoam heads as it airs the wig out and doesn&#x27;t end up stretching the cap.</li>
    <li> Very cheaply made, works though. You get what you&#x27;re paying for.</li>
    <li> It works, but is very unstable. Has no way to stabilize it the way foam ones do. It works best for my shorter wigs.</li>
    <li> I expected to receive a white wig holder but instead received a black one. Not bad of a product but as someone who intentionally paid more thinking I&#x27;d get a white stand, I would not have purchased it for any more $ than the other wig stands out there.</li>
    <li> Just sturdy enough to keep the wigs precariously balanced, but not confidently so. The problem is that when you insert the top part inside the bottom,the legs on the top don&#x27;t fully touch the surface you&#x27;ve placed it on. It kind of wobbles there, so you have to make sure it&#x27;s steady before walking away. No biggie, just not the best stand ever.</li>
    <li> Got what I paid for. Worked well and was flexible. Which made for an easy ease belly. Over satisfied with the stand</li>
    <li> Got this for my mother and all she was using was a big head stand.  She loves this because she can take this&lt;br /&gt;with her when she travels and it will take up no space at all.  It is sturdy enough to hold the wig and does the trick&lt;br /&gt;very well.  She loves it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money.  Can&#x27;t assemble it because the pieces are identical and they do not fit together as shown in the instructions. This is junk.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for, the pictured and described item was exactly what I got. It took me a minute to figure out how to put it together but it&#x27;s actually very very easy.</li>
    <li> Thank you - I am very pleased with my products!  i use them every day!  I was hoping for the best and it came!</li>
    <li> I ordered this stand on March 1 it made it to my house on March 11. It&#x27;s pretty good it holds my 100 cm wigs very well!</li>
    <li> Great to fit in luggage when traveling. Just what I needed for both home and traveling. I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing. I prefer over the Styrofoam stand.</li>
    <li> shipment was really fast and i received it a lot earlier than i thought. the product was great and just like it described on the site  the only thing tat it is not really stable. the plastic is too light and it is easily fall over when i put the wig on there. other than tat, it is alright.</li>
    <li> It said it was flexible but really its not and the pieces don&#x27;t exactly fit and broke putting it together but a little glue fixed the problem</li>
    <li> Not very sturdy, but did the job okay.</li>
    <li> -sturdy&lt;br /&gt;-good size&lt;br /&gt;-inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;I was worried that the quaily would be too good but i works just fine! And now I dont have to display my pink cosplay wig on my lamp shade.xD</li>
    <li> It was okay but didn&#x27;t hold my wig very well. It also took awhile to figure out how to set it up. I don&#x27;t really know much about wigs or stands though.</li>
