<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great delivery....Great seller and amazing product. Will buy again</li>
    <li> I have so many fragrances that smelled great the first 10 times I wore them and then they became cloying. Not this one. I even wear it to bed because I want to smell it constantly. Only downfall: it&#x27;s not long lasting, and needs constant reapplication. I&#x27;ve also just purchased the rose fragranced perfume from Cartier as well. Again, very nice and doesn&#x27;t get nasty over time.</li>
    <li> I love perfume. And this by far is now favorite  lasts all day and I receive many compliments.  Will definitely be my signature fragrance</li>
    <li> my mother cried she loved and always wanted this her entire life.  She used to sneak into Bullocks and try it on with testers and samples and now she has it. The real thing at a tremendous value!</li>
    <li> I found this in Cancun this past April and never bought it.  I went to the Duty-Free store at the airport and they did not have this.  I have been so sorry I did not buy while I was on vacation.  I then found it here and it was much cheaper :)  I love the feminine fragrance and the price :)</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my wife, and she love it! I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> The best!! Got at for mom after she feel in love with mine.</li>
    <li> This perfume is a dream! I have used and I am still using other Cartier perfumes, but this has become one of my favorites instantly! I love this so much, it goes on soft and it lingers. My brother says he will purchase this for his girlfriend as well. LOL, but it is very pleasant and whomsoever decides to purchase it will not be disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful scent and I get a lot of compliments.  I wear this day and night.  I don&#x27;t notice the scent much ( most perfumes give me headaches)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not awful just not to my liking.</li>
    <li> I love this sent. It smells like a soft pink powder.</li>
    <li> does not smell that great</li>
    <li> I was not satisfied with the perfume. It doesn&#x27;t smell the way I thought it would&#x27;ve.</li>
    <li> Wonderful!!  MY FAVORITE  A Light clean fresh fragrance.  I Can wear this year round,and never get tired of it.  I gave 1 as a gift and she loves it.</li>
    <li> This was first received as a gift. I just loved it and so did a friend.  For Xmas, I purchased it for my friend. We are both extremely&lt;br /&gt;happy with it&#x27;s fragrance.</li>
    <li> beautiful new floral, lots of lily , very complex. very feminine, very proper, very clean, changes over time, from just floral to a little spicy, love it will add it to my perfume wardrobe</li>
    <li> Beautiful, beautiful scent.  One of my all time favorites.</li>
    <li> I hear this all time..........What do you wear?  You smell soooo good!</li>
    <li> Pleasure! this perfume makes a living sense of peace and greatness. Intense and deep but with the delicacy of a rare flower.</li>
    <li> Best Perfume Ever!  Love this perfume.  My husband loved the way I smelled after using this perfume!  It last a long time after you apply it also.  This is now my new signature perfume I will be wearing everyday!  It has a very soft flower smell to it but seems modern not like other floral perfumes that I have worn before.</li>
    <li> Wife loved the product and I loved the price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best perfumes ever. Very feminine smell that stays with you all day. Absolutely love it. The price from Amazon is great compare to the one in the high end department stores where I use to buy it from. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as the one purchased in store.</li>
    <li> I really like it the fragance is very soft .</li>
    <li> Great scent! I like it during summer.</li>
    <li> Excellent, original and grate smell. Fully recommended</li>
    <li> I think is sexy and receive many compliments, I personally think is this a winter perfume so now I&#x27;m using it a lot and love it.</li>
    <li> The &amp;#34;sample&amp;#34; I acquired was lucious and lovely..actually quite captivating.  I was so thrilled to find this new discovery of what I thought would be my new &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; perfume.  Alas...I was thoroughly disappointed when I received my actual purchase.  The scent/seduction that appealed to me initially was there indeed.  But upon application on my skin, those receptors; i.e., wrists, behind the ears, elbow joints, were soon-to-be nothing but a memory of what was applied.  I have been a devotee of Estee Lauder&#x27;s &amp;#34;Knowing&amp;#34; for many years, and have truly loved its lingering - have oftentimes received the the question &amp;#34;may I ask what scent you are wearing...it&#x27;s so lovely&amp;#34; and of course would respond with a smile...&amp;#34;Knowing.&amp;#34;  Unfortunately this has not been the case with Cartier&#x27;s &amp;#34;Baiser Vole Eau De Perfume spray.  I also would add that I do NOT like the perfome bottle applicator - I find it cumbersome to say the least - not at all &amp;#34;friendly&amp;#34; to apply.  I fell truly in love with the sample - but found the end result (to my chemistry) quite dissapointing.</li>
    <li> This perfume is the only scent I have ever worn that both men and women comment on with wild abandon when I am wearing it. They stand in front of me drinking in the scent with dreamy smiles on their faces. I had a gentleman tell me the other day that the scent of my perfume was so intoxicating he couldn&#x27;t concentrate and needed to know what it was so he could buy some for his wife. He also sang a song to me in French about a \\&quot;Stolen Kiss!\\&quot;  I have had to write down the name of the perfume countless times for people who stop me and ask what I am wearing because they love it so much. It is a lovely scent of lilies that is so captivating it makes strangers sing to me in French and women beg me for the name of my perfume. I know Baiser Vole means, Stolen Kiss in French but I swear this scent is catnip for men and women alike! I have never received as many compliments on any other perfume I have ever worn as I have with Cartier&#x27;s beautiful and magical scent.</li>
    <li> Wife asked me for this as a gift.  I was skeptical, seeing the price and having never smelled it.  It costs a bit more than I normally would spend on a fragrance unless I knew it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased.  It&#x27;s been months and it still catches me pleasantly by surprise nearly every time I smell it on her.  I&#x27;ve heard people say, \\&quot;This or that\\&quot; smells like heaven.  Well, I hope to smell this in heaven someday.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from a friend, who is French, and brought this back for me from France (nothing like French goody bags!). I usually don&#x27;t wear perfume because I work in healthcare, but when I do it has to be statement worthy. (I work for a plastic surgeon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went home, opened the box, which was simple yet elegant. The box didn&#x27;t scream DESIGNER like almost every other perfume with all the glitter and holograms or whatever they are doing now. The flip top on the bottle is well made and sturdy, its more fun and girly then just squirting some with a pump spray. The spray was even, and a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent... I couldn&#x27;t tell you what&#x27;s in it, or what sect of fragrance it falls into but its a light fragrance that lingers. Its notes are smooth but strong enough to not be missed. My husband likes it better than any other perfume I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line? Everyone will experience fragrance differently, and although I&#x27;m sure someone out there will find a reason not to like this scent, I think you must be in the minority! This classy feminine scent is a signature moment, and will have someone stealing kisses from you in no time.</li>
    <li> I always liked Cartier perfumes. This perfume is very summery and sweet. It is the perfect for people who like sweet and flowery scent</li>
    <li> This women fragance is a gift, so I truly don&#x27;t know if my wife liked it or not. I read all the reviews and it seems fine to me.</li>
    <li> My friend is obsessed with this perfume. i went cheap this time and bought it from here and guess what it save both my time and money. The product comes in OME box which is great.</li>
    <li> The smell is disgusting, CAN ONLY SMELL THE ACHOHOL!!!  I really doubt its authenticity, and it&#x27;s NONRETURNABLE!!!</li>
    <li> I would bathe in this fragrance if I could! Love, love, love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So very fresh, powdery, a little hint of powdery scent.&lt;br /&gt;I receive compliments always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance !!</li>
    <li> This perfume smells so beautiful!! It&#x27;s definitely a summer perfume!! Loved it!! Exactly the same as in the store, and lasts for several hours on you.</li>
    <li> You know that scene in &amp;#34;The Office&amp;#34; where Michael finds out that Tobey will be counseling him? That&#x27;s my answer to this perfume. No! no. NOO. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aged is a wonderful description for a cheese or a wine, but not a perfume. This reminds me of a 4th grade public school math tutor used to wear. And I was in the slow kids&#x27; math class, so you know she didn&#x27;t get paid great enough to afford this. Would not recommend for anyone under 60. But I&#x27;m a little tipsy while writing this, so what do I know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;ll excuse me, I must go take a shower.</li>
    <li> Ordered this perfume from Amazon.com.  I fell in love with the fragrance when I went to Neiman Marcus, but could not afford the price.  After checking the local &#x27;sale&#x27; perfumery stores with no luck, I checked with Amazon was able to purchase it for a fraction of the cost.  The perfume was unopened in the original package.  Perfect and no problems.  Very happy.  It smells better when you save money!</li>
    <li> I like this fragrance a lot but I&#x27;ve had others I like better.  Of course, the packaging is fabulous!  Price was good too!</li>
    <li> Great perfume! Arrived on time too!</li>
    <li> smells great and lasts all day...I thought it was very reasonably priced for a good perfume.  I think this will be my signature scent.</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a gift from a department store. I noticed Amazon&#x27;s price was significantly lower so I bought it as a Christmas gift for my mom. This french perfume smells sooooo good. Not over bearing.</li>
    <li> My favorite Fragrance, I had used 6 bottles already!!</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance at a high end dept store and \\&quot;Loved\\&quot; it. I&#x27;ve worn it for nearly a year and get so many compliments on it. So when I saw it on Amazon for so much less I was thrilled. Until I bought it and put it on. It has No smell at all or so faint that it&#x27;s barely detectable. I am so disappointed! Must be old inventory or worse a knock off.... Buyer beware!!! Will return it and rebuy it at the dept store.&lt;br /&gt;Looked into returning it but I can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s flammable so considered hazardous material. WHAT?? They shipped it to me and that was fine. I will never purchase fragrance on Amazon again.</li>
    <li> Let me tell you, guys this is the best ever i went to 59th St to see how much tjis was on a very famouse deparment store no only was to much $$$ but the guy was rude like i cant afford it so amazon to the rescue less $$ same cuality ,i need another one soon ,Thenks guys</li>
    <li> This perfume Cartier Baiser Vole Eau De Perfume Spray for women by Cartier smells absolutely delicious. It lasts all day until the next day. It is so refreshing and I get a lot of compliments about it. This seller is fast with shipping and accuracy. Thanks</li>
    <li> Much older than a year old perfume, based on the alcohol smell. So 2 bottles to get rid of is becoming too expensive.</li>
    <li> Very feminine and light. Can&#x27;t smell it on me immediately after putting it on, so I wish it were a bit stronger</li>
    <li> Wife ordered this perfume and loves it.</li>
    <li> The scent is identical to the one I got in Italy, but the one I bought on Amazon fades away very fast. I don&#x27;t think you can smell it one hour later.</li>
    <li> A really refined and elegant scent with nice staying power.  I find these stolen kisses really work with my wife&#x27;s chemistry, and I can&#x27;t stop smelling her when she wears it.</li>
    <li> The product is real and original</li>
    <li> this is my wife &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; favorite perfume</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a Mother&#x27;s Day gift.  I absolutely love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with this purchase! The delivery time was quick and the perfume was exactly as I had expected! Loved finding what I needed so easily at Amazon!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this scent. My husband seems rather fond of it too. ;) I was given a tester sample  by a salesgirl at Neimans,, i fell in love with it...and as usual..found it for less on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This perfume came packaged professionally and it smells great. It does not smell good to me initially, but smell wonderful after it has dried down some.</li>
    <li> product of very good quality. responsible and very attentive. be definitively would buy them. I recommend 100%</li>
    <li> Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.</li>
    <li> The scent barely stayed on my skin.  I have purchased the same scent from department stores and had much better results so this one must have been old.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for 2 years and constantly am getting compliments about it. It&#x27;s almost a little scary cause noses and faces start moving towards me once they get a whiff but the compliments are nice. It&#x27;s a slightly sweet romantic smell but not overbearing. I suggest it for any gal looking to turn some noses. lol.</li>
    <li> I LOVED Chanel No.22 but they stopped making it several years back. We recieved a Christmas mailing from Neiman Marcus this year and when I pulled a page back that had one of those&lt;br /&gt;perfume samples sprayed in a fold in the magazine that you pull out (you know what I mean here), there was the EXACT smell of Chanel 22 but with the name of Baiser Vole... If you miss the FABULOUS smell of Chanel 22 then THIS IS IT! This \\&quot;Baiser Vole\\&quot; perfume is not one of those perfumes that are simular to Chanel 22 BUT THIS \\&quot;Baiser Vole\\&quot; IS THE DEAD RINGER TO IT!</li>
    <li> Why is so ship here when it&#x27;s doble the price in other stores? Is this a replica or not? Thanks.</li>
    <li> Having run out of perfume on a vacation and seeking a light, summer fragrance, I bought this one in Bari, Italy, upon the recommendation of the store owner. I fell madly in love with it and am dreading running out of it. Among its many qualities, it is not overpowering, although it lasts quite a bit, and it is definitely an elegant fragrance, worthy of the name of its designer.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes based on the sample size I tested and the glowing reviews here.  I practically bathe in this stuff and no one smells it.....including me.</li>
    <li> Perfume arrived timely and to the correct address and in good condition.  It did not smell quite like my previous Cartier Baiser Vole Eau De Perfume.  I have to squirt several squirts of spray which do not last all day.  My previous perfume took only one squirt and was with me in a pleasant way all day.  I am disappointed in the potency of the product.  I squirt away morning and evening and have been complimented on the scent.  Also I don&#x27;t get a headache from this perfume.</li>
    <li> This is a very classic smell.  It smells of elegance and wealth.  It does not have a sweet smell but it is very pleasing.  It lasts all day and both men and women compliment me when I wear it.  This was an amazing price for an authentic Cartier perfume! I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this new (to me) perfume.  Need to get another bottle but researching for an authentic and efficient vendor once again!</li>
    <li> My parents just got back from Europe. Before my Mom left she asked me what I would like from Europe. I said a good perfume and some good dark chocolate. Then she asked what kind of scents I like. I said a fresh, clean, floral. Now mind you my Mom does NOT wear perfume so I knew I was taking a risk in having her sniff one out. She brought back Cartier Baiser Vole Parfum and Body Lotion. I nervously took my first sniff and was under its spell. Then I got my husbands enthused approval on the fragrance as well. She did a great job picking a perfume for me...it is fresh, gorgeous, floral and unique. The bottle is perfectly shaped and elegant. She also brought me some European dark chocolate. Perfect gifts. I think this fragrance is perfect for any woman age 25 and up. It&#x27;s sophisticated and crisp... not stuffy.</li>
    <li> This is one of those scents that gets better throughout the day! It only takes one spray on my wrists and neck, and I&#x27;m set for the day. Everyone in my office has become obsessed with it. Perfect for the holidays and special occasions. I prefer more subtle scents for everyday.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;d think the fact that they fashioned the bottle after a cigarette lighter would have given me a clue!  I tried this at a department store and liked it, but after I bought it from Amazon, I noticed a tobacco note in the dry down I didn&#x27;t catch when I sampled it.  Yuck! Nothing alluring about smelling like a mixture of perfume and cigarettes which is what my former boss always smelled like.</li>
    <li> Wife thinks its fake, smells like wet dog</li>
    <li> Bottle is bigger than I expected. Satisfied with my order. It was a great price for the quality.</li>
    <li> Yes. She is enjoying ! Thanks</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this.  Only trying to get the wife to wear it?  Well, she doesn&#x27;t care too much for perfumes.  Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck.  Seems to be moderately priced.</li>
    <li> I will be returning item. Disappointing Cartier female fragrance ;Too strong,musky, masculine, for my tastes.</li>
    <li> This scent is beautiful. For casual or evening wear, it is perfect for both. I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for quite a while and always get compliments. It&#x27;s subtle and not flowery, which is my preference.i enjoy wearing it.</li>
    <li> Although this item is pleasant, it has a powder scent and is NOT the original fragrance.  This was my error.  I will be purchasing the original fragrance in the future.  Additionally, in my opinion, the shipping packaging was inadequate as well.</li>
    <li> A wonderful and beautiful fragance!  It has three notes of changes it makes and is wonderful!  Absolutely will keep this one on my perfume shelf...also, so much cheaper than buying from Cartier!!</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this perfume in a Macy&#x27;s order I bought online. Loved it so much went to the store to buy it, but they didn&#x27;t carry it in our local Macy&#x27;s because our area isn&#x27;t very populated. So I searched online and found it on Amazon Prime for A LOT less money than any department store price I could find! The free shipping on Prime is a hugh factor of where I make my purchases! It smells florally, but not too sicky sweet, and it&#x27;s quite clean and fresh smelling. My sister liked it, and told me it smelled &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34;!! Then I knew it was great. lol!!</li>
    <li> old product. Not fresh. Would not suggest buying this product.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this!  I get compliments all the time too. My signature scent for sure!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and product as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Same product as I used to buy at Nordstroms, for a lower price.</li>
    <li> Great price. Quick delivery and awesome scent.</li>
    <li> Baiser Vol&amp;eacute; means &#x27;stolen kiss&#x27; It is a very playful name. I got so many compliments and the people wants to know the name of perfume. This perfume is very fresh, rare elegant lily scent and very very elegant1</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It doesn&#x27;t last long but its a very soft smell. It took a long time to get to me but that was a shipping issue. I still love the fragrance regardless.</li>
    <li> I first found this fragrance as a sample in a magazine and loved it, so I bought it and I literally drown myself in it and the smell disappears in a short time, ill never buy it again, plus it smells different in the bottle. if I could return it I would.</li>
    <li> Whether she&#x27;s younger (at least 18) or more mature, this is a great scent - sophisticated, yet sexy without smelling like a cheap date. I also appreciate the size. It will last a long time because the bottle is pretty hefty. It&#x27;s a spray and has a very sophisticated flip top, that the lady you love will enjoy when she &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; it shut. Great value!</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent.  Smells delicious.  I get a lot of compliments on it. Very good quality.  I am so happy to have purchased this product.</li>
    <li> I know some people are partial to woodsy scents, which are not my faves, but this stuff doesn&#x27;t smell like woods...it smells like moss. Or mold. Or both. So, take my advice and do not buy it. Gross.</li>
    <li> This perfume is very summery and light. Immediately after spraying, there is a big cloud of lilies. It&#x27;s very green and floral. The dry down is soapy and clean. The bottle is beautiful!</li>
    <li> I got a couple trial size samples of Baiser Vole from a retail store and really really liked it. When I saw the price of less than half of what the 3.3oz is going for in department stores I admit I had my suspicions but I threw it on my wish list. It turned out that my partner really liked the way it smelled too and he surprised me with it. It&#x27;s the real deal. Not a tester, packaged nicely, and legit scent. I don&#x27;t know how Amazon does it sometimes! So happy about this!</li>
    <li> I love Cartier everything !!! Need to say more ?i guess not especially when the price is right !</li>
    <li> The smell it&#x27;s really original.</li>
    <li> I live this fragrance very much it is my number 1 so far. I wish i got the set.</li>
    <li> I love smelling like this all day long, sweet and misterious, warm and fresh, for all kind of women; you&#x27;ll feel gorgeous.</li>
    <li> I get countless compliments  when I wear this !!!</li>
    <li> I love love love this perfume!  It&#x27;s packaging was great and the lid pops open to dispense the perfume.  Great feature!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried sample from Neiman Marcus magazine and i liked it right away.This perfume is awsome! Love it! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have been complimented so many times when I wear it. It is a long lasting feminine, pretty scent, especially when layered with the body lotion.</li>
    <li> I first tried this perfume at Nieman Marcus and it was awesome!  But I found it for about 60% less from Beauty Encounter, a third party seller thru Amazon.  After about a month the scent became rancid and the color changed from a pale pink tint to a pinkish-yellow tint.  I realized something wasn&#x27;t right after the A-Z guarantee timeframe passed!  So I&#x27;m stuck with this!  If you really want this, I would strongly recommend purchasing at a full service department store.  I&#x27;m very unhappy about my purchase.  I must say that I have purchased other fragrance items from Amazon and no problem, but not this time.  Got ripped off!</li>
    <li> i really love this one amazing scent suave, sweet sexy, sophisticated just amazing worth the money i am happy with it</li>
    <li> Love the aroma, delicate and fresh. It is my favorite now.</li>
    <li> I had looking for a Lily fragrance for years when I smelled this one a department store. I loved it and wanted it right away. I had the impression the sample I was given lasted longer on my skin, but maybe it was an illusion. This bottles contains the authentic EDP, smells beautifully, but unfortunately I can not smell it much after 2-3 hours. When the retail department store price is about 160$ CND , you expect it to last longer. Luckily, I found it for less on this website. It might only be that this particular smell does not saty on my skin&#x27;s chemistry. I still love it .</li>
    <li> I got this product in a nicely sealed box, it is very strong when you first put it on, take care not to put on too much! This fragrance does not wear off quickly, your nose just gets used to it. This is my favorite fragrance EVER, and it is PERFECT for spring. Other favorites of mine are Armani She, LeLabo&#x27;s Rose 31, and Dolce &amp; Gabbana La Lune.</li>
    <li> I have gone to Nordstroms and sprayed this scent on me many times and it lasts well into the night.  The scent on this one lasts a very short time.  I have experimented with one scent on one wrist and this one on the other wrist and every other perfume I have lasts longer.  I do not understand why the one at Nordstroms would be any different but it is.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  It is light and last a long time. The tones change as it wears down, but the scent last over 8 hours.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is one of the best I&#x27;ve worn. I have received many compliments; everyone asks me what it is. It is a soft floral scent that really lasts.</li>
    <li> I just loved it when some lady put it on my arm, the fragrance is very feminine, and that&#x27;s exactly how I want to feel.</li>
    <li> Price is amazing for the size. I can&#x27;t believe I paid what  I paid on Amazon</li>
    <li> I had a sample of the eau de toilette but that was not available so I purchased this and it is too strong and overpowering!&lt;br /&gt;The sample scent was mild and quite nice.</li>
    <li> Gave as gift to someone who constantly asked about my perfume.. Made her very happy. What more could I ask</li>
    <li> I am convinced this is authentic (bought from seller OTC trading). I have a sample from Nordstrom left and I put one on each hand and compared them. They are the same!! It is so beautiful. I have been in love with this perfume for a while but hesitated buying it because it&#x27;s so expensive and I can&#x27;t afford that right now. But I&#x27;m so glad I found it for less than half the price!</li>
    <li> HUELE DELICIOSO, VIENE MUY BIEN PROTEGIDO, Y EL PRECIO ESTA PERFECTO, MAS BARATO QUE EN EL MERCADO  ME ENCANTO Y ADEMAS LLEGO MUY RAPIDO</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells expensive and I always get compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it. Was the real product too, not some knockoff you get sometimes when you order from specific sellers. That&#x27;s why I stick with Amazon as the seller. They never let me down.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance, I have worn Cartier Must for 20 years, wanted something lighter for spring and summer,  this fragrance is beautiful soft, powdery, just lovely and the bottle is beautiful.</li>
    <li> Nice strong scent.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this perfume awhile ago and loved it! I finally saw it on Amazon for a good price and ordered it. Glad I did!</li>
    <li> I originally bought this when it first came out in 2011/2012 from Sephora. I got a bottle a quarter of the size for $112!!  I was a bit nervous to purchase from here as the price seems too good to be true! But this is the real thing! I love this scent, it changes a bit as I wear and adapts to me, but it&#x27;s so soft, sweet and a feminine musky smell. I love it. If you&#x27;re concerned about quality, don&#x27;t be... this is the real thing and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the baiser vole from nordstrom and fell in love with the scent.  It stayed with me all day and beyond.  When I got this I sprayed at 9am and by 11:30 the scent was gone.  So its either not authentic or diluted.  Very disappointing as I realized after I ordered it that I cannot return it.  Now I have to go purchase the real thing and am losing money instead of saving.  Not happy...</li>
    <li> I smelled and tried this prior to purchasing and so I did not even think twice about buying it. It is so amazing but I also realize its surely not for everyone, it is a very strong smelling but light at the same time it also smells better as the day goes by. So I would recommend trying in a department store if you, can before just buying it. However it is for me and I so so love it! Not to mention that it as a whopping $80.00 less than on the original brands website! Woo-hew score!</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this perfume months ago. It sat on my sink along with my other perfumes until yesterday. Let me just say my favorite all time perfume was Chopards Casmir, my second by Juicy Couture but once I sampled this perfume, I have to say that I have a new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this perfume is so feminine, so fresh, so unlike anything Ive ever tried. I was just elated spraying this perfume on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its just truly an amazing, clean smell. A smell you just want to stop and take in. A smell where nothing else in the world matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I spray this perfume on I imagine myself being very wealthy, in bed with fresh white sheets, thinking about nothing at all, absolutely nothing at all. My mind is totally free taking in this fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so loving Cartier right now. They got it right with this one.</li>
    <li> Its a very well known fragrance for women so I got this for a friend of mine, who didnt have prime. He had no complains so I&#x27;m confident it worked for him.</li>
    <li> I was concerned when I read some of the reviews stating that the products was fake. I noticed that a 100 ml was sold by Amazon.com, unlike the other 0.05 Oz and 1.6 Oz. I decided to try it and I&#x27;m glad I did, received the real perfume at a great price.</li>
    <li> never regretted buying something so much!! FAKE PERFUME, smells terrible</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase. I paid a third of the price (at retail stores) for three times the amount. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> This perfume is perfect for spring. It&#x27;s light, fresh, with gentle floral notes and is not sweet. It smells like an orchard in bloom:) The price is very fair for the size of the bottle. Delivery was earlier than scheduled.</li>
    <li> Love it!  My new signature fragrance!</li>
    <li> TRIED THIS PRODUCT IN ARUBA AND LOVED IT. IT WAS MORE PRICY THERE SO I WAS GLAD TO SEE IT THRU AMAZON.!</li>
    <li> VERY RICH AND HIGH QUALITY AS YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM CARTIER. NOT A YOUNG SCENT. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR THE 40 AND UP GROUP. ENJOY</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my mother has a bottle and I adored the scent.  I knew her bottle of Cartier was very expensive so I looked it up on Amazon.  It was significantly less expensive so I went ahead and purchased it.  The box and bottle looked the exact same, but the color and fragrance were slightly different.  I guess I should expect that being that it&#x27;s a lot less pricey than the ones that are sold in exclusive department stores.  But, all in all, it smells close to the same and I should just expect that for that much less, I would not really be receiving the original.  Hahaha.  But, I&#x27;m happy enough with it.  I will be able to get the real-deal soon.</li>
    <li> Took a little long on the delivery, considering other items I order.  But the product is very nice! :)</li>
    <li> This perfume spray is perfect - not too heavy, but detectable.  I&#x27;m a professional and can&#x27;t &amp;#34;light up the room&amp;#34; with my scent, but this is subtle and fantastic.</li>
    <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful, soft scent that I just love. Good for people who get nauseous from strong, heavy perfumes. It also lasts a long time despite the softness.</li>
    <li> Im sure of this  fragrance  it has to grow  on me</li>
</ol>
