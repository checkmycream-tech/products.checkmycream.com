### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The product is very good and meets expectations.</li>
      <li>It is a great value and one bottle lasts for around 6 months.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this product per the directions more than a month already, but don&#x27;t notice any brightening of my skin.</li>
      <li>I love all Skinceuticals products.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff &amp; for the price</li>
      <li>I am very happy with this product and actually like it better that the phyto+</li>
      <li>I like most of the products in this line, so I had hoped I would like this one.  </li>
      <li>I have since started using the Clinique spot remover, and my skin was noticeably better after 4 weeks and it has gotten more uniform and lighter in coloration in 3 months of use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s called Advanced Pigment Corrector.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product and really helps to reduce brown and dark spots as well as smooth the skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
      <li>Some lightening did occur, nice silky feel, very lightweight but the main benefit doesn&#x27;t appear to be the lightening aspect.</li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, most (if not all) of these non-prescription products are just hype.</li>
      <li>Great product, I can see the difference in less than a month!  </li>
      <li>I THINK it&#x27;s doing some good on my dark spots</li>
      <li>So if your willing to spend this much on a product then please know all the facts before purchasing this!</li>
      <li>Funny how some things work for some people, and not for others.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products for my facial age spots, including the Clinique product.  </li>
      <li>I bought this after I tried one of their products after getting a facial &amp; love that.</li>
      <li>it has been a very noticeable difference.</li>
      <li>Finally found something that will affectively fade sun spots and mild acne scars.</li>
      <li>The Skinceuticals company just released a brand new pigment regulating product for this reason.</li>
      <li>When I completely stopped using it for about 2 wks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 6 months now and it doesn&#x27;t appear to have lightened my brown spots at all.</li>
      <li>at least they should have better pump.</li>
      <li>On mature skin with melasma, this will have no effect.</li>
      <li>I used nearly the entirely bottle and saw no difference whatsoever.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m using this product per the directions more than a month already, but don&#x27;t notice any brightening of my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this product faithfully for 2 months, and the dispenser is truly a failure.  Also, I did not see any lightening.  I have since started using the Clinique spot remover, and my skin was noticeably better after 4 weeks and it has gotten more uniform and lighter in coloration in 3 months of use.  So, I&#x27;ll be sticking with the Clinique.</li>
    <li> My skin above my lip started turning brown (I have no idea why) but it was gross. I bought this after I tried one of their products after getting a facial &amp; love that. So, I wanted to give this a try &amp; after using it for 1 wk I seen a difference &amp; now it&#x27;s been 6 wks &amp; it&#x27;s almost gone! I love this stuff &amp; for the price I will buy it again!</li>
    <li> This product has been discontinued by Skinceuticals for the simple fact that it does not work. The Skinceuticals company just released a brand new pigment regulating product for this reason. It&#x27;s called Advanced Pigment Corrector. So if your willing to spend this much on a product then please know all the facts before purchasing this! Here&#x27;s the link to the revised pigment corrector. I&#x27;m not trying to sell you this by any means but for someone like me that has used the product in review, I know it doesn&#x27;t work and I know this newer pigment corrector DOES work.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> You have to be patient....it took about 5 weeks of using it every day before I could see the age spots getting lighter.  After about 3 months all except the darkest spots were gone.  I started using it less often, just got tired of putting it on every day along with sunblock, moisturizer, etc.  When I completely stopped using it for about 2 wks. I could see the spots starting to show up a little bit again.  So now I&#x27;m back to every day.  It works if you can be diligent enough to use it every day, keep using it, and use sunblock!</li>
    <li> I rarely return any product,but this one, pump just did not work at all, shocked for this price at least they should have better pump.Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Some lightening did occur, nice silky feel, very lightweight but the main benefit doesn&#x27;t appear to be the lightening aspect.</li>
    <li> My facialist recommended I try this - to the tune of 150 bucks a visit! I found it online and have been using it every night. Big difference! I&#x27;m getting compliments on my skin again! Finally found something that will affectively fade sun spots and mild acne scars.</li>
    <li> Pigment Regulator has helped to diminish my hyperpigmentation. It is a great value and one bottle lasts for around 6 months.</li>
    <li> I used nearly the entirely bottle and saw no difference whatsoever. On mature skin with melasma, this will have no effect. Maybe it would help some with minor freckles or age spots, but I saw no change in those areas, either. As far as I can tell, most (if not all) of these non-prescription products are just hype.</li>
    <li> Great product, I can see the difference in less than a month!  I will definitely be re-ordering in the future!</li>
    <li> I like most of the products in this line, so I had hoped I would like this one.  However, it has not really done what it was meant to do--i.e., reduce skin discolorations.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> The product is very good and meets expectations. I am satisfied with the purchase and recommend it to anyone interested in a quality product.</li>
    <li> Funny how some things work for some people, and not for others.  I have tried many products for my facial age spots, including the Clinique product.  I have been using this product for only 3 weeks, and I see a noticeable difference.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love all Skinceuticals products. My skin looks brighter and smoother. I&#x27;ll continue to use this every day. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Needs patience. Dr Ts method fastet</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 6 months now and it doesn&#x27;t appear to have lightened my brown spots at all.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product and really helps to reduce brown and dark spots as well as smooth the skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
    <li> I THINK it&#x27;s doing some good on my dark spots but it may take longer to remove them .... I&#x27;m still hopeful.. So I&#x27;ll reserve judgment</li>
    <li> There is not enough product in the container.</li>
    <li> I had small dark spots from acne...this product lighten them within a month...it has been a very noticeable difference. I am very happy with this product and actually like it better that the phyto+</li>
