### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great!  </li>
      <li>These were perfect for that.</li>
      <li>Best ive found ever, they do splinter and fall apart after 10 minutes or so.</li>
      <li>so I thought it would be perfect.  </li>
      <li>Very good for being an anti bacterial</li>
      <li>I read how great these can be as chewing sticks.</li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s great to have in the car.</li>
      <li>and these are great for that.</li>
      <li>lol ...  &lt;br</li>
      <li>Arrived on time an a great chewing device.</li>
      <li>cost is great, too.</li>
      <li>These are really great though.</li>
      <li>I guess for smokers (which I am not) might be a good thing.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s a fair price.</li>
      <li>Good quality toothpicks.</li>
      <li>the product is good service is also good.</li>
      <li>/&gt;These have a very prominent cinnamon taste from the start</li>
      <li>Sometimes you want some kind of taste-sensation in your mouth</li>
      <li>They help with smoking cessation and they provide a pleasant alternative to the original (for me).</li>
      <li>Wahooa, are they strong!  </li>
      <li>They give a great strong cinnamon flavor while leaving your teeth feeling clean.</li>
      <li>When I first got these the flavor was great.  </li>
      <li>He used them up and wanted more.</li>
      <li>Love these.  </li>
      <li>I love chewing on these things.</li>
      <li>and they really do taste great.</li>
      <li>Love the way they taste.</li>
      <li>I wanted to love these.  </li>
      <li>To be honest, I quit smoking for other reasons, but these are still awesome.</li>
      <li>Great for keeping my gums clean and my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
      <li>Good, but not as good as the standard tee tree flavor in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Nice for fresh breath.</li>
      <li>I know for sure they still will carry a mild cinnamon taste an hour or two after putting one in your mouth but because the originals are oil infused, they keep their own strong unique flavor even longer.</li>
      <li>Menthol taste is a bit too strong for me, so strong that the cinnamon flavor goes almost undetectable.</li>
      <li>It is a real shame as they had such great flavor in the beginning and was a nice size to carry in my truck.</li>
      <li>I enjoy these cinnamon sticks</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve had the original and haven&#x27;t tried these, you have to try them.</li>
      <li>The Tea Tree Oil originals are quite a unique flavor and they&#x27;re</li>
      <li>I bought these for my son who requested them after finding our original pack at our house.</li>
      <li>They help my sweet cravings during the work day.</li>
      <li>Good solid container</li>
      <li>The cinnamon flavor is pretty strong.</li>
      <li>These scream cinnamon where the others have a mild cinnamon flavor nuance.</li>
      <li>I only reccomend cinnemon kind.</li>
      <li>so they stay fresh and don&#x27;t break.</li>
      <li>Also the cinnamon (cassia) is the primary flavor ingredient in these where it&#x27;s the second ingredient in the original.</li>
      <li>I do really love the flavor, but when I run out I might try a different brand to see if I can avoid the splintering problem.</li>
      <li>pretty potent.&lt;br</li>
      <li>If the flavor lasted longer I may use these more regularly.</li>
      <li>But for occasional use, they are strong and leave your mouth tingly.</li>
      <li>but this is too much.  </li>
      <li>Toooo much tea tree.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;These are a real blast of cinnamon, so I nibble at these very cautiously.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re not so much of a breath freshener as the tea oil.</li>
      <li>Like, really chewing.</li>
      <li>They all share the same ingredients but the cinnamon flavored ones have some of the original flavor&#x27;s ingredients removed.</li>
      <li>Bought these for my husband to help cut down more on smoking.</li>
      <li>A year later, I am still smoke-free and I can say that these tea-tree sticks played a large roll in getting me through the first couple of months.  </li>
      <li>I buy them from, so I usually buy as many as I can to have them on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great item the cinnamon is like a kick in the teeth with how tough it can taste and very enjoyable when your breath stinks a lil</li>
      <li>, it states clearly in the product description that these are toothpicks.</li>
      <li>chews them regularly and they really help him out</li>
      <li>but the tea tree oil almost completely masks it.</li>
      <li>He loves the cinnamon taste and says it last super long.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that these seem to splinter very quickly, much more so than the Preserve brand.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m a die hard fan of the original Tea Tree Oil ones.</li>
      <li>but you can&#x27;t really leave it in your mouth until some of the flavor has died down some.  </li>
      <li>If I had one complaint it would be that the flavor doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>

<li> Be careful!</li>

<li> The cinnamon are a little less \\&quot;unique\\&quot; a flavor than the originals (obviously), and they may be a little easier for some people to tolerate.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve found that it even burns my lips a little sometimes, so I try to put on chapstick before popping a tea tree stick in my mouth.</li>
<li> It really isn&#x27;t worth the effort of the burn and bad taste.</li>
<li> I am not sure about digesting the tea tree oil that comes in them.</li>
<li> For some silly reason I was under the impression that these &#x27;sticks&#x27; were larger.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m using them to cut back on my gum-chewing, because I go crazy without something to chew on all day.    </li>
<li> I try to get some of the flavor sucked off slowly</li>
<li> Instead i think I might have become addicted to these toothpicks.</li>
<li> I am cinnamon addicted</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re a gnawer like I am, you might find yourself with unpleasant splinters and wood bits floating around in your mouth.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t curb cravings, tastes awful and would not order again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great item the cinnamon is like a kick in the teeth with how tough it can taste and very enjoyable when your breath stinks a lil</li>
    <li> Its the only toothpick i use. Best ive found ever, they do splinter and fall apart after 10 minutes or so. I only reccomend cinnemon kind. Wish they came mint flavored.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my husband to help cut down more on smoking. He loves the cinnamon taste and says it last super long.</li>
    <li> Love the way they taste. Nice for fresh breath. I am not sure about digesting the tea tree oil that comes in them. But for occasional use, they are strong and leave your mouth tingly.</li>
    <li> I enjoy these cinnamon sticks but I&#x27;m a die hard fan of the original Tea Tree Oil ones. They all share the same ingredients but the cinnamon flavored ones have some of the original flavor&#x27;s ingredients removed. The only reason for that is so the cinnamon is the dominant taste in these. They do not contain fennel oil, or peppermint. Also the cinnamon (cassia) is the primary flavor ingredient in these where it&#x27;s the second ingredient in the original. The cinnamon are a little less \\&quot;unique\\&quot; a flavor than the originals (obviously), and they may be a little easier for some people to tolerate. My wife \\&quot;loves\\&quot; these and she \\&quot;likes\\&quot; the originals. The Tea Tree Oil originals are quite a unique flavor and they&#x27;re pretty potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have a very prominent cinnamon taste from the start and they really do taste great. If I had one complaint it would be that the flavor doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original. If the flavor lasted longer I may use these more regularly. I know for sure they still will carry a mild cinnamon taste an hour or two after putting one in your mouth but because the originals are oil infused, they keep their own strong unique flavor even longer. These are really great though. They help with smoking cessation and they provide a pleasant alternative to the original (for me). They&#x27;re not so much of a breath freshener as the tea oil. There&#x27;s cinnamon also in the originals also but the tea tree oil almost completely masks it. These scream cinnamon where the others have a mild cinnamon flavor nuance. I&#x27;d recommend trying a two pack with one of each flavor if you&#x27;ve never tried either of them. If you&#x27;ve had the original and haven&#x27;t tried these, you have to try them. They retail locally (around me) for $3.50-$4.00 so it&#x27;s a fair price. The problemhere is they sell out everywhere I buy them from, so I usually buy as many as I can to have them on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering online I&#x27;d buy a few of these to take advantage of shipping costs... if you like cinnamon you&#x27;ll definitely like these.itely like these.</li>
    <li> I picked these tea tree sticks up at random about a year ago, put them in my car glove box, and didn&#x27;t think much of them until a week or so later when I decided to try to quit smoking.  A year later, I am still smoke-free and I can say that these tea-tree sticks played a large roll in getting me through the first couple of months.  Praise the power of the tea tree oil lol ...  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I love chewing on these things. Like, really chewing. Gnawing them to bits. I&#x27;m using them to cut back on my gum-chewing, because I go crazy without something to chew on all day.    The cinnamon flavor is pretty strong. I&#x27;ve found that it even burns my lips a little sometimes, so I try to put on chapstick before popping a tea tree stick in my mouth. My only complaint is that these seem to splinter very quickly, much more so than the Preserve brand. If you&#x27;re a gnawer like I am, you might find yourself with unpleasant splinters and wood bits floating around in your mouth. Be careful! I do really love the flavor, but when I run out I might try a different brand to see if I can avoid the splintering problem.</li>
    <li> Great!  Spicy cinnamon chew sticks.  Great for keeping my gums clean and my mouth feeling fresh. Good solid container so they stay fresh and don&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> Good quality toothpicks. Menthol taste is a bit too strong for me, so strong that the cinnamon flavor goes almost undetectable. I guess for smokers (which I am not) might be a good thing.</li>
    <li> I saw the Driver movie with Ryan Gosling and decided I needed toothpicks in my car. I also might have ADD and I often feel the need to chew on things. These were perfect for that. They give a great strong cinnamon flavor while leaving your teeth feeling clean. I have heard of these being used to cure people of smoking addictions, but i don&#x27;t smoke. Instead i think I might have become addicted to these toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Good, but not as good as the standard tee tree flavor in my opinion.</li>
    <li> When I first got these the flavor was great.  However the plastic holder they come in will not stay closed and pops open constantly.  This has caused the sticks to loose some of the flavor to them.  It is a real shame as they had such great flavor in the beginning and was a nice size to carry in my truck.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love these.  I read how great these can be as chewing sticks. I am cinnamon addicted so I thought it would be perfect.  Wahooa, are they strong!  Toooo much tea tree.  If you know tea tree at all it has a smell of road tar.  Very good for being an anti bacterial but this is too much.  The cinnamon tries to drown it out but doesn&#x27;t.  I find it burns my mouth.  I try to get some of the flavor sucked off slowly but you can&#x27;t really leave it in your mouth until some of the flavor has died down some.  It really isn&#x27;t worth the effort of the burn and bad taste.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time an a great chewing device. I recommended to every one of my friends. Already went through a box.</li>
    <li> For some silly reason I was under the impression that these &#x27;sticks&#x27; were larger.  Imagine my surprise when I received a box of toothpics!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my son who requested them after finding our original pack at our house. He used them up and wanted more.</li>
    <li> Pfft. Doesn&#x27;t curb cravings, tastes awful and would not order again.</li>
    <li> the product is good service is also good. i i i i i i i i i i i i</li>
    <li> bought this sticks to help my son stop smoking it has been 3 weeks and he is doing well. chews them regularly and they really help him out</li>
    <li> I had bought these to help me quit smoking, but I also found myself using these in the afternoon instead of eating snacks. To be honest, I quit smoking for other reasons, but these are still awesome. Sometimes you want some kind of taste-sensation in your mouth but you don&#x27;t want to be consuming calories and these are great for that.</li>
    <li> For me, smoking isn&#x27;t about the addiction to nicotine or other addictive concotions in cigarettes. It&#x27;s about the physical. These help me with having something physical for my mouth and hands in place of a cigarette. When I&#x27;m on the computer, I&#x27;m notorious for smoking, moreso than any other place. Also, it&#x27;s great to have in the car. I no longer smoke in the car!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a real blast of cinnamon, so I nibble at these very cautiously.  I&#x27;ve also tried the Tea Tree sticks and like those, also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cost is great, too. The price of these 100 sticks equals one pack of cigarettes, and I don&#x27;t use ten sticks/day. I will definitely be ordering more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it states clearly in the product description that these are toothpicks.</li>
    <li> Love these.  They help my sweet cravings during the work day.</li>
