    <li> A perennial favorite is this classic scent. Totally different from others.</li>
    <li> Very nice, classy cologne!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift - It was requested and given and everyone is happy - can&#x27;t get better than that!</li>
    <li> My husband is a fan of Caswell-Massey products , but since their store closed in New York he has been hard pressed to find their products.  Newport is his favorite and he was delighted with the purchase.</li>
    <li> What happened to the well known blue bottle ?  It does not smell the same as the the bottles I have purchased directly from Caswell Massey !  WHY ?</li>
    <li> just enjoy this fragrance</li>
    <li> Well packaged, in perfect shape and many compliments given when wearing it.  Hope it continues to be carried. Good price.</li>
    <li> EXPECTED THE SAME PRETTY BLUE BOTTLE---ARRIVED AS CLEAR GLASS.</li>
    <li> great scent as advertised</li>
    <li> This was a gift to my son-in-law and he has now decided it his favorite cologne.  It does smell good.  Nice and masculine.</li>
    <li> Hubby loves this scent</li>
    <li> A great product and company!</li>
    <li> Sent &amp; received as promised.</li>
    <li> Last bought this cologne from a Caswell-Massey store we used to have where I live.  Hadn&#x27;t had any for 20 years. Decided to order a bottle online.  Just as great a smelling cologne as it was 20 years ago.  The women LOVE it !</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I love the scent. It&#x27;s crisp, clean and masculine smelling. Unfortunately, the scent doesn&#x27;t last for long even if you later with other products.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this cologne for my son for 4 years. I started when he hit puberty. It is not overbearing like so many colognes. It has a clean scent and great for teenagers (as well as men) who tend to &amp;#34;over spray&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t make you choke. Great product.</li>
    <li> Have worn Caswell-Massey Newport Cologne since I was in College ... over 50 years now.  Caswell-Massey has a problem with keeping this in stock, so order when available.  LOL.  I get many compliments, over the years, for this fragrance.  Greenbriar, Jockey Club, and Casma (if you can find it) are also excellent fragrances for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> excellent men cologne....</li>
    <li> Fragrance is the most evocative of the senses; I have used this cologne for 45 years.  The packaging was changed, but I was hoping the fragrance was the same.  But the formula was altered to a light bay rum; it now smells like any other of dozens of upscale splashes, though the company vehemently denies the alteration.</li>
    <li> All ways superb. I wish you still made under arm deodorant in the Newport  series</li>
