<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It works on its own without complete system, but works better with 3 step system. I used it twice a day for about two weeks, but I had really bad acne and my skin was completely clear</li>
    <li> Best cleanser we&#x27;ve found for my skin &amp; my teenage son..pricey though</li>
    <li> i feel like it can be a little expensive; however, i love my clear complexion, and i&#x27;m willing to spend the money.  use it daily.  works very well.  finish it off with the revitalizing toner. those are the only 2 products i use.</li>
    <li> Obviously everyone has different skin types so not everything works for everybody. I have very sensitive and oily skin and this product has been the ONLY one of MANY that i have tried and actually works. I use it daily and people have asked what i use to keep my skin so clear. I buy on amazon bc the contract stuff thru proactiv seems too excessive, and i always ended up with more or extra of products that i didnt use as much or need.</li>
    <li> Product came 3 days earlier than expected. I&#x27;ve bought 4 bottles of Proactiv before and it&#x27;s the right product. Definitely will last a while becauseit&#x27;s 8 fl oz (i usually get 2 months out of the 6 oz so ill probably get 3-4 out of this). I&#x27;ll definitely buy from this seller again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0075QVOFW PROACTIV DARK SPOT CORRECTOR,1 OZ SIZE]]</li>
    <li> Great product.  Much cheaper to purchase this way.  Be careful of towel bleaching.  Only use white towels if you dont want bleach spots.</li>
    <li> Good for daily facial cleansing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Proactive before with terrific results. This does nothing. It smells the same, feels the same, but it does nothing for my breakouts. Whatever the active ingredient is, it&#x27;s not working. Expired?</li>
    <li> No better product that I can find for facial cleansing.  Our entire family uses it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is my best friend! :)</li>
    <li> Great deal and great price!</li>
    <li> This is the third installment of this acne treatment for my 14 year old.  It doesn&#x27;t get used up evenly so I buy the three part treatment and then supplement  the combo as needed.  My daughter&#x27;s face was a mess before she started this regiment and is now all but cleared up. ;-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv Solution for the last 10 years and love it. This is the best deal I have found for it.</li>
    <li> I was really pleased with how fast my product arrived and the seller was great. However, I like the original ProActive better because I&#x27;ve found the new advances cleanser doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well for me as the original one did. Not NEARLY. I would suggest buying the Original ProActive from this seller.</li>
    <li> My kids have gone through numerous prescriptions and nothing has worked as well as Proactiv. They continue to use it and it continues to work. They only use the cleanser, however. They don&#x27;t use the toner or moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The only thing we have found to help my husband with his acne. In your 40&#x27;s you don&#x27;t want to feel like you are 16-18 with acne. This works great and leaves his skin so smooth.</li>
    <li> I previously gave this seller a lower rating due to my lack of knowledge of the product.  It is indeed what I have ordered and came quickly and exactly as was described.  My apologies on my previous ignorance of the new \\&quot;improved\\&quot; product as Proactive describes.  As far as Proactive \\&quot;new\\&quot; Micro Cleanser goes, I find that the product is exactly the same as previous product offered.  Not sure if it costs more but if it does, I&#x27;d go with the old product.  No issues with seller though.    Thank You</li>
    <li> Great product! Controls skin breakouts-acne, blackheads, whiteheads. The beads are fine enough that it would not damage or hurt your skin. I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been suffering from constant breakouts for the past two years (baffling, as I&#x27;m 25 and never had acne as a teenager), and this product was recommended to me by a friend. I was ready to try just about anything because I had grown really tired of fighting the recurring cysts on my chin, nose, and forehead.    Within a week of using this stuff twice a day, along with my regular Dr. Hauschka toner and moisturizer, my skin was practically clear. I still have some post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation that might take a while to fade, but I have yet to see any new breakouts and it&#x27;s been about a month.     I also bought the Proactiv treatment lotion. I use it once or twice a day, and it seems to help keep my skin clear as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only this product from Proactiv for years now and it&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my skin clear.  When I stray I break out.  It has 2.5% BP in it so it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have used Proactive for years, for me it&#x27;s the only thing that gives me a clear complexion. And for years no matter how much I tried to adhere to the &amp;#34;schedule&amp;#34; I never finished up my supply as quickly as the direct buy website kept insisting I should and it would automatically send and charge me for another new product when I didn&#x27;t necessarily need it causing me unnecessary cost and an over stocked supply that I didn&#x27;t have room for. Without having to stalk down some mall kiosk clerk I can conveniently find exactly what I need, when I am ready for it and it comes in a larger than &amp;#34;average&amp;#34; kit size so it lasts even longer.</li>
    <li> Great product. I used Proactiv for a couple of years now and I always run out of the step 1 product so decided to buy a bigger one for when I&#x27;m at home (college student out of the state) and I share this product with my brother.</li>
    <li> Great big size to this. Lasts long time. Really nice. I would recommend for sure. I will be back to buy more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 3-step Proactiv system for over a year now and overall I am pleased with the results.  It takes a couple of months to start working so don&#x27;t get discouraged if you don&#x27;t get immediate results.  It doesn&#x27;t entirely prevent acne either, it just drastically reduces the frequency of getting acne.  I&#x27;ve tried most of the products you can buy at the drug store and none of them work as well as Proactiv.  If you can afford it (because it definitely isn&#x27;t cheap) I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Accurate product description and it arrived on time.</li>
    <li> Great product have used it for a long time. Does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Works wonders for adult acne. Can be a little drying at first. The green tea moisturizer works great for the dryness. I highly recommend trying this!</li>
    <li> I love Proactiv- it works better for me than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I noticed even more of an improvement after switching to the New Proactiv from the original, though I did this the same month as switching to a new birth control, so I can&#x27;t be sure of the exact reason.  Also, it&#x27;s nice ordering in such a big size, and this prevents me from actually dealing with Proactiv (well- Guthy Runker), who repeatedly charged my credit card after I asked them to delete from their system back when I did business with them.</li>
    <li> Have always liked proactive products. I like to use this to wash my face. My teen and young adult children have used Proactive products for years. Second time ordering. Liked the price and was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> I like this product and use it all the time.  It does not stop the breakouts, but it does help to reduce them.</li>
    <li> I love the face cleaner &amp; refining mask. I also use green tea moisterizer. My son started using it &amp; liked it so&lt;br /&gt;much that I started using it.</li>
    <li> i have used this product for many years now and will use it for many more and i like the bigger size so that i dont run out as often</li>
    <li> Most of the time, this is the only proactiv product I need.  I use it once a day, just in the shower.</li>
    <li> have been using it for a few yrs... works best for me... when stop seem to get breakouts more often</li>
    <li> This cleanser keeps my skin smooth and minimizes breakouts. Also, I enjoy the smell of the cleanser and I can feel the mini micro crystals working.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and set it aside because I wouldn&#x27;t need it for 30 more days since my other one wasn&#x27;t empty yet. I went to use it AND IT EAS EXPIRED !!! I&#x27;m not out of my 30 day window and wasted $40 because the seller sold me something EXPIRED! WHAT A WASTE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DONT TRUST THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Where I live we have no mall so it makes it impossible to get unless we go out of town.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd time ordering this cleanser and will keep continue ordering this. My daughter has a bad acne and it&#x27;s been hard time to get rid of this bad acne. Since she started to use this in about 2 weeks, I started to notice the change. Acne is fading away little by little but patient enough to see more result. And this 8 fl oz will last longer and a little more  bargain than 4 fl oz.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv for several years now, and I love it! I started using it before I got pregnant with my six year old daughter, when my doctor advised me I would not be able to take my acne medication during a pregnancy. The Proactiv commercials claim that you will see results in 2 weeks. For me it took two months, but the result was well worth waiting for! Over the years, due to the high cost of Proactiv, I&#x27;ve tried using other products on different occasions, such as the cheaper Acne Free Clear Skin System AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion), always with disastrous effect. You know the saying you get what you pay for...exactly! So, now I&#x27;m back with my Proactiv. Its expensive, but well worth it. This cleanser has fine micro-beads that gently stimulate the skin while cleansing; it leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and smooth. I find that the repairing treatment (which is the face cream) lasts me three times as long as the cleanser and toner, so invariably I will purchase an extra bottle of cleanser and toner in between buying the kit. I prefer the 8 ounce luxury size, as it lasts the longest and is the most economical to buy.</li>
    <li> Best cleanser for acne prone skin.  A little harsh for sensitive skin but great for oily/combination skin. Leaves your skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Son&#x27;s use this and it really does clear up their face. I wish it came in a bigger bottle though.</li>
    <li> I buy this every year from Amazon for my daughter in law. Best price and quick shipping. I would recommend this product to anyone needing that extra skin care which Proactiv is proven to help.</li>
    <li> Order arrive promptly and just as described. This is actually for my 17 yr old son and he loves it. Works well!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> A young 20 something and she&#x27;s requested it for years.  Her skin is beautiful and we have a family history of acne.</li>
    <li> DO NOT USE THIS! It actually creates more oil, and is terrible on your skin. If you have a bad breakout, go see a DERMATOLOGIST!</li>
    <li> I am an adult with acne and this is the only product I have found that works.  I only use the cleanser because my skin would be too dry if I used all of the Proactive products together.</li>
    <li> Proactive makes great products; their facewash and repair lotion especially.  Glad I don&#x27;t have to go hunt down a kiosk now and I can just order as needed.</li>
    <li> It is a good deal on a good product. The commercials depict the BEST possible outcome (results may not be typical :)), although it does keep my blackheads down and my breakouts to a minimum with combo skin.</li>
    <li> Sent wrong item.  To many hours trying to get it right.  Do not recommend...</li>
    <li> My wife bought this for her skin and has been helping her skin to clear up.  The texture of the cleanser is nice and nice smell</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne since high school and am now 26 and have tried different things and NOTHING works like proactiv. This is not the easiest size to travel with but I like having to large size so it lasts longer!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 10+ years and love it.  Heads up to anyone new buying this product- use white washcloths because it will bleach out any colored fabrics! I am so thankful that I could get it on amazon too, because my local shopping mall took the kiosk out that I always buy it from.  So THANK YOU AMAZON!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great – i&#x27;ve had acne for years and this keeps me acne free – highly recommended it!</li>
    <li> Got the product on time. Product&#x27;s expired date is also good for me.</li>
    <li> From the time I ordered to when it was delivered, it was smooth sailing. Have been using this product for some years now and is the only thing that keeps my face demons at bay...love it!</li>
    <li> The only stuff that works on my acne.</li>
    <li> No more acne after using the Proactiv kit. (step 1, 2, 3). I don&#x27;t care if i have to import from USA to Costa Rica, is by far the best acne treatment ever.</li>
    <li> I have had acne since I was a young teenager that lasted well into college. I was resistant to try proactive because all advertisements for acne medicine claim to clear acne, but I never had any luck and I was worried about spending so much money and possibly getting the same results. I finally tried it, as a last resort, and I&#x27;ve never used anything since. I do still get the occasional pimple, but after years of searching this is by far the best solution I have found.</li>
    <li> I love proactiv. it&#x27;s been my ONLY skincare for 10 years now and i dont plan on switching. this one was fast and it was amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my skin. Originally I thought it was just a gimmick, but it actually works. My skin seems to respond better to benzoyl peroxide over salicylic acid. Works as good as my old triaz 10% that Galderma stopped making.</li>
    <li> If you use Proactiv this is the same stuff as always.  Just nice not to have to make a trip to the mall or worry about the hard sells when you go directly to the Proactiv website</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to have had nice skin my whole life.  That all changed when I turned 40.  The acne and redness was horrible.  I was worried that Proactiv would be too drying for my skin.  However, I do the three step regime once a day, alternating days and it works great.  Because my skin is so dry, I don&#x27;t use it everyday.  This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what you expect from Proactive. This product is very thick and you can feel the micro crystals. My wife and I purchased a different version of this and it was too thin. One thing to note, if you do not rinse off your face (or any part of your body that you are using Proactive on) properly, you may accidentally stain your towels.</li>
    <li> Good product, repeat customer</li>
    <li> Proactiv has been in my household for a couple years my significant other is the one that uses this all day and it has removed the bumbs and keep his face clear from acne and all the other unwanted things it does everything it saids it will</li>
    <li> First when i used it.. it made my face worse than it was just like the original&lt;br /&gt;proactiv.. then my face got used to it and i no longer have pimples : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i love proactivv...&lt;br /&gt;this is just like the originals onesss</li>
    <li> Works well. This is a large bottle.</li>
    <li> Did not work as my wife&#x27;s previous proactive purchases from original manufacturer.  Blemishes etc continued to appear unlike previous applications.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t need to sell you on the item, it&#x27;s flat out the best (only) facial cleanser for people with acne. I&#x27;m older and have only occasional breakouts, but I swear it makes my face look younger, evens out my skin tone and makes it glow.</li>
    <li> I use the Proactive clenser and toner every day. i have adult acne, and these two products are the ones I can&#x27;t live without.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a dab of the Proactive mask when a pimple pops up. I leave it on overnigh &amp; it is usually gone by the next day.</li>
    <li> This product work very very well, and the size is bigger than I though. It is really big, I think is better buy a less big size, because I think is going to overrun.</li>
    <li> Works awesome.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  No problems or worries of a counterfeit product. It&#x27;s just a larger, cheaper bottle of the stuff in the mall.</li>
    <li> These products work great for me. Takes a long time to get them though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the last 8 yrs.  I&#x27;m in my 60s and still have a problem with acne.  I have seen dermatologists over my lifetime, I have used cleansing beads, acne products, natural products - you name it...nothing has worked until this.  The first couple of times I used this I followed the directions using just a dime size amount for each cleansing,  In order to see how much cleaner I got my face, I first washed it with the acne cleanser I was originally using.  Then I washed my face immediately with this cleanser and used a clean white facecloth to remove it from my face.  I WAS FLOORED!  The amount of dirt this removed (after I had already washed my face) blew my mind.  I am a regular customer now and will not stop.  Thank you to the 2 doctors who came up with formula.  I&#x27;m not ashamed of the condition o9f my skin now.</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge!  It has lasted 1 year with daily use</li>
    <li> proactive is the only thing that has worked this well for my acne. I only use this product (if i use step 2 and 3 my skin gets way to dry and scaley) I use this once a day and am acne free now!</li>
    <li> I always like this product and it works.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this product and it really works. He has been using this for a year and no breakouts.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that has ever worked for keeping my skin clear. I enjoy getting the larger bottle so I don&#x27;t have to order as frequently. I also enjoy ordering from Amazon so I don&#x27;t get signed up for the club.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactive for years!!! I didn&#x27;t have real bad acne, but now that I use it, I get a pimple maybe one every couple months. I love that it works so well but is not harsh on my skin, I was diagnosed with dermatitis about a year ago and the Proactive does not irritate it, and I have had to stop using a lot of things on my face since I got this dermatitis!! I love that they made the big bottles!!!! Has anyone tried their new formula that just came out recently? Is it better? Worse?? I wanted to say to, I don&#x27;t use the other stuff like the toner or face mask, I just use the cleanser and keeps my face looking good!! :)</li>
    <li> When you go to squeeze the product out, the squirted piece pops out and you get a whole bunch of product in your hand that ends up being wasted. It&#x27;s very frustrating. But I love the cleanser, just won&#x27;t buy this bottle again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Proactiv. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and it really does work. It&#x27;s a super product!</li>
    <li> Hi:&lt;br /&gt;This product does a great job.  At first, my son (who I bought it for) did not use the product on a regular basis. As soon as he started to use it day after day, we have seen a his face clear up considerably.  He really didn&#x27;t have bad acne but just enough to bother him.  It is a good product.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This shipment was in perfect shape.</li>
    <li> Great product! Have been using this for 4 years now and love it!!  I turned so many others on to it as well and tell them to procure it from amazon!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 3-step Proactiv system for almost a year now and although it never completely cleared up my skin it definitely made things better and more tolerable. I have very sensitive skin so other acne treatments usually dry out or aggravate my skin making it look worse than it did in the first place.  This cleanser is strong enough to help without hurting.    I haven&#x27;t stopped using proactiv and I do not plan on stopping to use it either however I did also recently start using treeactiv oil because I heard it was gentle on the skin and helped with acne - [[ASIN:B00LFT0CFI TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment &amp;#x2605; All Natural Acne Spot Treatment &amp;#x2605; Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]].    It is a tea tree oil based acne treatment.  Well, I have to say that if you still have acne while using proactive, you must also try this oil.    I am almost completely acne free which is unheard of in my 23 years of existence. Again I want to stress, that i still use most proactive products included in the 3-step system but in the past year my skin has been nearly as clear is it is now!</li>
    <li> I have tried over the counter creams but only the Proactiv line works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cleanser, toner &amp; whatever they call step 3, it&#x27;s the leave on cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I don&#x27;t use this system my skin breaks out like crazy.  I have very, very oily skin and have had acne issues since I was a teenager. Even did the prescription treatments and they didn&#x27;t work as well as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a cheap program but for my peace of mind to have clear skin it&#x27;s SO worth it.  When comparing to some of those other skin care lines this really isn&#x27;t that expensive, I&#x27;m just frugal!</li>
    <li> I first bought this directly through Proactive, but they sign you up for automatic shipping which left me with unused expired products at the end of the year and I was happy to find this on Amazon.  I have very sensitive skin, so I don&#x27;t follow the recommended 3 step process by proactive.  I only wash my face at night, do not use step 2 and only step 3 on a as needed basis.  This works well for me without burning my skin (and left me with lots of unused products from the proactive membership, which is now canceled).  This product works better than anything I have previously bought at any stores.  Be careful when using this product as it will bleach clothes, I have accidently gotten some on a sleeve and it took the color right off it.  This is also why I only use white towels to dry my face after washing it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My skin looks younger and my acne is completely gone. I have been using Proactiv for a few years now and will never stop. This size bottle is enough to last way longer than 120 days. I love it!</li>
    <li> Proactiv is great but BEWARE OF KNOCK OFF PRODUCTS!! If it does not smell right and the micro beads do not dissolve it is fake and will break out your skin and clog pores bad...... I have been using this for years and has always worked. This new bottle I just bought from Amazon smelled like plastic and the beads in it don&#x27;t dissolve with water it literally feels like tiny hard plastic beads which caused my neck and areas to have strange breakouts in just days of using, Warning don&#x27;t buy from the seller &amp;#34;Innovative Inventory&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> At 39, I still get acne.  When I use this once a day, it keeps my skin clear. Anymore than once a day is very drying.</li>
    <li> I love it!  Excellent for cleaning my face throughly and definitely helps keep pimples away.  I have recommended it to others and it has helped them as well.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost everything but nothing helped me.If proactive can treat me then it can treat anybody.If you have acne prone skin like me then please try proactive twice a day.Most importantly please stop eating junk food.Try to change your lifestyle.Drink lots of water.</li>
    <li> My daughter had severe acne and after 3 months use her face looks wonderful.  It is a time consuming regime, but worth the effort, just don&#x27;t expect to see results immediately.</li>
    <li> Been using this for years.  It&#x27;s the only cleanser that controls blackheads.</li>
    <li> Used for years works great.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent and I couldn&#x27;t have a clear face without it.</li>
    <li> My highschool son loves the proactive products.  His skin is clear and looks great.  It is expensive, but worth the cost when it keeps skin looking good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv for a few years now, as it always has worked for me. Bought this and my acne on my face is the worst ever. Pretty sure they repackaged it as something else. BUYER BEWARE</li>
    <li> My son uses this on his preteen face...it has cleared his face up &amp; keeps the acne under control! We&#x27;ll continue to use this</li>
    <li> Proactive is the best way to be rid of those zits and, this is the BIG bottle of facial cleaner.  If you know Proactive, you know what this is but, you don&#x27;t have to deal with repeat shipment</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for acne.  Thank you for making it so affordable at Amazon.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> Got teens? If they have acne, don&#x27;t waste your money on Proactive. I am not sure how or why they insist upon renewing the entire order each month or if we are getting on their list via Amazon, but they are obnoxious when you try to cancel it. We just wanted to try it, now we have hundreds of dollars worth of lotions and washes that do nothing.</li>
    <li> What... you got a zitty face?  Not me - I HAD one.  Then I singed off the first 3 layers of skin by rubbing this on my face then setting it on fire...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding.  In my many skin stuggles as a pubescent teenager and vitamin-d deficient young professional, this is hands down the best acne facial cleanser around that&#x27;s not too harsh on your skin. Quality yo.</li>
    <li> My teenager has been using this for years and It works. What&#x27;s nice is ordering thru Amazon you wont get lock in to order every month on an open account thru proactive and can order just what you need when you need it. Thanks Amazon!</li>
    <li> Proactiv works. My boyfriend has been using it for years to treat his adult acne. He tends to purchase the small bottles (which tends to not last as long). So I decided to surprise him and get him a larger bottle. First of all, for anyone who is concerned. The picture shows a 6 oz bottle. But you do get an 8 oz bottle. This bottle will last you for several months! My package arrived fast and was packaged nicely. Will purchase again. This is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this product. Easy to use and easy on skin. Helps keep skin clear and husband likes to prevent razor bumps after shaving.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend proactiv.. Any age. I tried numerous things for acne and finally found this. It truly works better than anything else out there</li>
    <li> My son who is 11 and myself 34 have recently decided to try Proactive. I originally bought the 3 step program but have come to falling in love with only this product in the set of 3. This cleanser has made all of my son&#x27;s face clear right up in a matter of 2 days as well as mine. I don&#x27;t have a terrible skin problem.I just have some occasional pimples and clogged poors and this product is able to clean out the poors and remove all excess dirt and makeup that would otherwise cause acne problems.&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend this product to anyone that wishes to clear up your face. it may seem expensive, but it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> NICE ITEM, AS DESCRIBED, A+++</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and now my teenage son uses it too! I would highly recommend Proactiv to anyone struggling with acne.  Be sure to purchase the toner (step 2) and repairing lotion (step 3)....I tend to run out of the cleanser first when I buy the set so I opted for the super-size.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for more than 5 years. I LOVE IT &amp; I would recommend it for anyone!</li>
    <li> I swear by Proactiv cleanser and toner.  They prevent my 43 year old female skin from looking like that of a 12 year old boy.  I don&#x27;t do the subscription from the company&#x27;s website because 1)I don&#x27;t use all the products that they make you buy and 2)they send the products too frequently.  I found a kiosk in my nearby mall but the ONLY reason I go to that blasted place is to buy this stuff.  I looked on Amazon a while ago but the Proactiv products looked sketchy and one review actually said the writing on the label was in &amp;#34;Chinese&amp;#34;.  I looked again recently and found these items.  The reviews were good so I went for it and ordered them.  I truly believe they are exactly the same products.  I compared them to what I bought from the kiosk and there is no difference in packaging (same tamper-evident seal) or labeling.  I hope this seller continues to be able to provide the authentic Proactiv products.  Amazon is soooo much better than schlepping to a mall when you know exactly what you need!</li>
    <li> Trust me, I&#x27;ve tried them all over the last 17 years, and this is by far a superior product for someone with acne.  It exfoliates well and yet is pretty gentle.  It will, however, bleach your towels and sheets (from the benzoyl peroxide), so invest in white sheets and towels.  It&#x27;s worth it.  It can also bleach the top rim if your shirts, so be sure to rinse thoroughly.  My entire family uses this cleanser.  The other Proactiv products are also great, but we all just use the cleanser.</li>
    <li> The product itself, which I&#x27;ve used for over a year and thoroughly recommend, I&#x27;d give five stars to. I&#x27;ve used the 6oz bottle in the past and have had no problems with it. This is the first 8oz (120-day supply) bottle I&#x27;ve purchased and, along with other reviewers, have on multiple occasions experienced the inner cap pop off due to pressure when squeezing the bottle. I have remedied this by storing the bottle upside-down, but my main concern is that the product may have been contaminated (I use it in the shower and am afraid water/other substances could have made their way inside). If you&#x27;re looking to save money by buying the luxury size, I could still recommend it but with caution. Be careful! I hope that the manufacturer remedies this.</li>
    <li> Just the right size and quality I was looking for in Proactiv. I have used this product for years and this is the real deal and in a much larger and convenient size, so I don&#x27;t have to keep ordering it every month or so.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this fake crap! It is not the real product- wrong texture, wrong smell and the bottle looked about 10 years old when it arrived, despite having a smudged expiration date that appeared to read 2015. The shrink wrap had obviously been rewrapped. My guess is they are either filling old bottles with fake product or watering down the real thing. I have used this for years and it has always worked great for me, but my skin was terrible while using the bottle I purchased from this site. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Get it at the mall from a reputable retailer. I repeat, this is a scam. Not the real product!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best product and I love the option to buy it separate from the rest of the Proactiv line.  If I feel a breakout coming on and I use this wash, it will nip it in the bud.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Proactive works very well on my daughter&#x27;s acne problem skin. It&#x27;s very gentle yet strong enough to rid her face of pimples and other acne.</li>
    <li> I wanted a larger bottle since I use this product everyday. But everytime I tip the bottle to get the cleanser out, the plastic top pops off from the pressure, and a large &amp;#34;gob&amp;#34; of the cleanser comes out. It&#x27;s a mess every time and a big waste of this expensive product. I wish I bought more of the smaller bottles, which I&#x27;ll plan to do next time. Otherwise, the product itself (the cleanser) is just fine.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a month since I received this and started using it and works great to help me clean up my skin. Smells a lot like baby lotion too and the exfoliation might be too rough the first time you use this but and I didn&#x27;t mind the dryness that much</li>
    <li> Even at 50, it helps my skin look and feel better.  My skin is smooth and a more even tone.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Just like the toner, this is an essential piece to my daily cleansing routine. I use it with my Clarisonic Mia and the cleanser seems to work better than just hands alone.</li>
    <li> Love the original proactive, and a great price for the 8oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product because I use so much all the time it really is a waste to buy anything else but this size if you use it often and enjoy the results</li>
    <li> This is a great product that has worked very well for my teenage son in the past and continues to work well.  We will continue to use ProActiv cleanser for years to come.</li>
    <li> Because I am in my 40&#x27;s, I was leery of trying Proactiv. Would an anti-acne product with benzoyl peroxide be too harsh for thinning skin? The product seemed a bit pricey, too, since you can buy acne wash with more active ingredient (benzoyl peroxide) for a lot less at the drugstore. I tried the Proactiv line anyway, and it worked with no ill effects.&lt;br /&gt;This is an alkaline cleanser, so it is important to follow it up with the acidic Revitalizing Toner. The pH balance of the Proactiv products may be why they do not irritate my skin. This balance allows me to keep using benzoyl peroxide without side effects - I can&#x27;t use the drugstore stuff without looking sunburned.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, my acne went away in about 3 weeks, except for red spots from old breakouts, which are still fading.&lt;br /&gt;If you are battling aging and acne, you may want to try their Retinol Night Moisturizer. It counteracts the drying effects of the other products without causing breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;You really do have to stick with just Proactiv products faithfully for this to work. Sounds like a sales pitch, but I think it has more to do with chemistry.</li>
</ol>
