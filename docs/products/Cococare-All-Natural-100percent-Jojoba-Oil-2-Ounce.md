      <li>, my legs have become super dry from lack of moisture.</li>
      <li>Made my hair feel very soft and it also helped it look shiny without feeling greasy</li>

      <li>Seems a little watered down compared to others I&#x27;ve used, but I do really like the cap &amp; squeeze function so you can portion it out better</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m super lazy</li>
      <li>Other than I give the product a thumbs up for its very noticeable benefits.</li>

    <li> I use this oil to massage my earlobes before putting in my plugs or tappers. This oil is very nice and conditions my skin nicely. very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> I replaced my night cream with this, as I am a strong believer of natural product. And it seems to be natural as it is an oil. It hydrates my face and penetrates in my skin nicely. Know your skin before ordering.</li>
    <li> I love this oil especially since it is 100 percent jojoba oil. I use this on my kinky hair and It feels soft and I have a shine afterwards.</li>
    <li> The price is a bit high, but  Concocare All Natural Jojoba Oil truly works wonders on my dry hair and skin.</li>
    <li> Since this pure oil is next in line to the natural oils that our hair produce, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ll let you know....It just came in today (11/06/13).</li>

    <li> Excellent oil for the price and on par with the higher priced ones. Works excellently as a body/hair oil. Would definitely recommend, it is a quality that is always expected of Cococare. They are a  brand that has been around for a long time with many other products.</li>
    <li> Being that it&#x27;s winter and I&#x27;m super lazy, my legs have become super dry from lack of moisture. I used the Jojoba Oil once and they&#x27;re already softer. I also use it for my gauges. My lobes are super soft and plump.</li>
    <li> Use it for my hair (massage into my dry itchy scalp), nails, henna hair treatments, too keep my guaged lobes and organic wooden gauges nice and healthy.</li>
    <li> Seems a little watered down compared to others I&#x27;ve used, but I do really like the cap &amp; squeeze function so you can portion it out better</li>
    <li> I use it on my hair to help with dry scalp. It adds moisture and has a nice smell. My only complaint is that the bottle is a little small for the price.</li>
    <li> Good product, but i think it has cocoa butter in it..</li>
    <li> I have natural African American hair (3b) and I was looking for something alittle lighter than olive oil which my hair loves but again it is so heavy. Well... the jojoba oil is really light and no noticeable smell but the bottle was so small.. I should have read the fine print:(</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it almost every day. I mix a little in my lotion after i shower and use it on my face and a lite in my hair as well. Nice quality and a nice buy. Definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it daily as a skin moisturizer, and also on my hair as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I got this bottle of Jojoba oil to take care of my cuticles. I dip a qtip in the oil every morning, and dab a little bit on the bed of each nail - and my torn up cuticles have improved hugely. Couldn&#x27;t recommend this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also decided to get only 2oz because it was the smallest size available. I&#x27;m very happy with this choice, because at this rate it&#x27;s still going to take me over a year to finish the bottle.</li>

    <li> This oil is great! I love how soft it makes my ears feel, and it&#x27;s great for lubricating plugs to get them in your ears. It arrived very quickly. The only issue I had was that a little had leaked out when I got it. So, the bottle and packaging it came in was greasy. Not much leaked out, so it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. I&#x27;m glad that I bought it!</li>
    <li> I received this product in no time!&lt;br /&gt;Small bottle but a little goes a long way, my bottle is still full and I use it to seal my ends often. Would buy again.</li>

    <li> delivery was vry quick. Packaging was very secure. 2oz for the price was very good. I purchased because oil was recommended becuase of being light and obsurbing well it does both I use on my face and body. This has many uses I still need to try on my hair.

If I see this brand become available in larger size and the price is right I will order again</li>
