      <li>Is , really good</li>
      <li>I have never received so many compliments about how good I smell!</li>
      <li>This Vetiver is great, powdery, citricy, sexy scent.  </li>
      <li>and it becomes unforgettable :)))</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe that somebody would not fall in love with this fragrance!</li>
      <li>The Original Vetiver is another beautiful creation from the house of Creed.  </li>
      <li>Their colognes are amazing... pure..potent.</li>
      <li>Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
      <li>I also own Creed Millesime Imperial..</li>
      <li>request nice product</li>
      <li>Despite the lackluster performance, Vetiver remains a Top 5 fragrance for me – the juice is that good..</li>
      <li>nicely done Creed family.  </li>
      <li>Consider Yes nice product</li>
      <li>This cologne is by far the best cologne that I&#x27;ve ever worn.  </li>
      <li>The fragance is very very light.</li>
      <li>love it on my husband thank you</li>
      <li>I love the way this smells</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;grassy,ceder,pine\\&quot; fragrance was a bit overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I have never smelled anything this refreshing.  </li>
      <li>Is just a freaking water, nothing authentic about it!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wasted my money</li>
      <li>Buy it and enjoy it!</li>
      <li>This juice is amazing – I feel fresh, confident, distinguished with a gentlemanly persona when wearing this fragrance –</li>
      <li>Creed makes so many fine scents...</li>
      <li>I love Creed&#x27;s Original Vetiver.  </li>
      <li>It was way too strong and had a fragrance of a Christmas wreath that would not go away for hours.</li>
      <li>Vetiver has modest (at best) longevity, lasting 3-4 hours on me and slightly greater on clothing – and all within arm’s length (or closer) projection.  </li>
      <li>I have a few and will say that Creed’s Original Vetiver is the best – the editions by Guerlain, Tom Ford, and Prada are all good, but not quite the Creed standard.  </li>
      <li>I would not call it a flaw; it is just that Original Vetiver is a lighter fragrance</li>
      <li>But my  friend didn&#x27;t know the difference he was excited to see the box</li>
      <li>and it is original.</li>
      <li>Vetiver offers outstanding flexibility to be worn across all seasons and to/for most events.  </li>
      <li>The one caveat with Original Vetiver is that the longevity is not as good as Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed or Aventus, both of which are great fragrances in their own right.  </li>
      <li>my other favorite scent from Creed is Himalaya, which I think is a bit stronger, and amazingly good.</li>
      <li>and I will tell you it my absolute favorite..</li>
      <li>while not overtly \\&quot;barbershop\\&quot; in scent profile, Original Vetiver exudes an aroma that is angelically FRESH and CLEAN.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, clean, and crisp smelling.</li>
      <li>This scent is clean... crisp..</li>
      <li>well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>This is the second scent that I own from Creed....</li>
      <li>and worth the money...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other options from Creed (e.g. Millesime Imperial) and they were good but not as good as this.</li>
      <li>Great scent but lasting power very low disappears after on hour or two!!!</li>
      <li>This one is great, the smelly last an tremendous long time, I will be buying more of this in the future</li>
      <li>Is perfect for daytime but not strong enough at all</li>
      <li>Very nice, sophisticated yet juvenile and the aroma really last.</li>
      <li>This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
      <li>Definitely a crowd pleaser and office safe.  </li>
      <li>I would love it if it would last at minimum eight hours on my skin.</li>
      <li>smells great but don&#x27;t last long</li>
      <li>At first I thought the sent was wearing off until the end of one day</li>
      <li>High-end perfume -  high-end price ;))</li>
      <li>Hands down, this is my favorite cologne available.  </li>
      <li>I should not be writing this review as I feel Original Vetiver is the best kept secret in the Creed lineup, but I must give this fragrance its due credit.  </li>
      <li>.It&#x27;s the real deal .</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>My final tally for Original Vetiver is 4.0 stars out of 5 stars.  </li>
      <li>really could recommend it even if the price is high.</li>
      <li>Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit!</li>
      <li>The price is a bit on the high side, but the beauty of the fragrance is worth every penny spent (it is all in the attitude, right?).  </li>
      <li>The sent is fresh, last all day and is not over powering.</li>
      <li>Body chemistry has a lot to do with how a scent smells and certainly men and women have very different body chemistries.</li>
      <li>Starts off a little strong but settles down quickly.  </li>
      <li>I like it so much that I actually use it myself</li>
      <li>I have noticed that over the last year that fragrances heavily dominated with vetiver notes have become my favorite.  </li>
      <li>Many Vetivers have that \\&quot;barbershop\\&quot; smell to them, and although I do not mind that type of scent, Original Vetiver has very little in common with the aforementioned \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Vetiver fragrances.  </li>
      <li>Some may critique this scent as excessively soapy, but in actuality, Original Vetiver only accomplishes what all \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; soaps strive to achieve: impart the user with a pristine aura.  </li>
      <li>IMO, it&#x27;s very feminine (though not sweet or cloying)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very nice, sophisticated yet juvenile and the aroma really last. I&#x27;ll recommended to everybody.</li>
    <li> Same product that&#x27;s in the store only thing is that it only comes with a box no plastic wrapping . But my  friend didn&#x27;t know the difference he was excited to see the box .It&#x27;s the real deal .</li>
    <li> I hate it...just a poor fake copy!! how can i do to return it?</li>
    <li> One of my favourite fragrances</li>
    <li> love it on my husband thank you</li>
    <li> Smells great! Is perfect for daytime but not strong enough at all</li>
    <li> I just wanted to add my two scents (ha ha), because I note that the negative review was written by a man and the two positive reviews by women. I am also a woman and I adore this scent. I love the way this smells and I get compliments EVERY TIME I wear it. It also has awesome staying power. Maybe it just smells different on men? Body chemistry has a lot to do with how a scent smells and certainly men and women have very different body chemistries. In fact, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like to smell this on a man. IMO, it&#x27;s very feminine (though not sweet or cloying)</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne approximately six months ago. There is 3/4 left in the bottle and I noticed there is no more scent. When I used it it does not smell anymore. I felt like cheated on this one. I don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that somebody would not fall in love with this fragrance! I like it so much that I actually use it myself and I am a woman. It has such a complex and sophisticated bouquet, it&#x27;s impossible to resist.</li>
    <li> Is , really good I tried and next day I keep the same aroma in my shirt</li>
    <li> This cologne is by far the best cologne that I&#x27;ve ever worn.  I ordered a sample off of amazon a year ago and finally decided to bite the bullet after running out of my Mount Blanc Legend.  The price of Creed Vevtiver at my local Neiman Marcus was $315...I was astounded that I found it on Amazon for under $140.  Hands down, this is my favorite cologne available.  I have never received so many compliments about how good I smell!</li>
    <li> Great scent but lasting power very low disappears after on hour or two!!!</li>
    <li> The Original Vetiver is another beautiful creation from the house of Creed.  This juice is amazing – I feel fresh, confident, distinguished with a gentlemanly persona when wearing this fragrance – take your pick - it is all about attitude..!! I have noticed that over the last year that fragrances heavily dominated with vetiver notes have become my favorite.  I have a few and will say that Creed’s Original Vetiver is the best – the editions by Guerlain, Tom Ford, and Prada are all good, but not quite the Creed standard.  In addition to the beauty of the fragrance, the bottle is piece of art – the green and black is a reflection of the fragrance – nicely done Creed family.  Vetiver offers outstanding flexibility to be worn across all seasons and to/for most events.  Definitely a crowd pleaser and office safe.  My only concerns with this fragrance is performance.  Vetiver has modest (at best) longevity, lasting 3-4 hours on me and slightly greater on clothing – and all within arm’s length (or closer) projection.  The price is a bit on the high side, but the beauty of the fragrance is worth every penny spent (it is all in the attitude, right?).  My final tally for Original Vetiver is 4.0 stars out of 5 stars.  Despite the lackluster performance, Vetiver remains a Top 5 fragrance for me – the juice is that good.. Enjoy your day and happy fragrance hunting…</li>
    <li> An excellent brand and superb scent. It&#x27;ll last all day and be noticeable but not overpowering. Creed is the only brand I use - nothing else measures up - and my other favorite scent from Creed is Himalaya, which I think is a bit stronger, and amazingly good. I&#x27;ve tried a few other options from Creed (e.g. Millesime Imperial) and they were good but not as good as this. Finally, Creed is expensive but to me it&#x27;s the very best, and well worth the cost. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This one is great, the smelly last an tremendous long time, I will be buying more of this in the future</li>
    <li> The sent is fresh, last all day and is not over powering. At first I thought the sent was wearing off until the end of one day I met up with my daughter and she said &amp;#34;dad what&#x27;s that you smell good&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This Vetiver is great, powdery, citricy, sexy scent.  Starts off a little strong but settles down quickly.  I recommend it</li>
    <li> great price and it is original.</li>
    <li> smells great but don&#x27;t last long</li>
    <li> I like the fragrance. I would love it if it would last at minimum eight hours on my skin.</li>
    <li> I love Creed&#x27;s Original Vetiver.  Many Vetivers have that \\&quot;barbershop\\&quot; smell to them, and although I do not mind that type of scent, Original Vetiver has very little in common with the aforementioned \\&quot;traditional\\&quot; Vetiver fragrances.  Quite the contrary, while not overtly \\&quot;barbershop\\&quot; in scent profile, Original Vetiver exudes an aroma that is angelically FRESH and CLEAN.  I have never smelled anything this refreshing.  Period.  Some may critique this scent as excessively soapy, but in actuality, Original Vetiver only accomplishes what all \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; soaps strive to achieve: impart the user with a pristine aura.  No soap I have encountered will make one emanate such cleanliness.  I should not be writing this review as I feel Original Vetiver is the best kept secret in the Creed lineup, but I must give this fragrance its due credit.  The one caveat with Original Vetiver is that the longevity is not as good as Creed&#x27;s Green Irish Tweed or Aventus, both of which are great fragrances in their own right.  I would not call it a flaw; it is just that Original Vetiver is a lighter fragrance so it comes with the territory.  Buy it and enjoy it!</li>
    <li> Smells like a dream - seriously! Ladies just freak out once they smell it and it becomes unforgettable :)))&lt;br /&gt;I really could recommend it even if the price is high. High-end perfume -  high-end price ;))</li>
    <li> As described..... Great scent</li>
    <li> I have thought about buying a \\&quot;Creed\\&quot; product for some time now.  However, after purchasing Creed Vetiver I am leary of ever buying another Creed Cologne.  It was way too strong and had a fragrance of a Christmas wreath that would not go away for hours. The \\&quot;grassy,ceder,pine\\&quot; fragrance was a bit overwhelming.  &lt;br /&gt;JDH</li>
    <li> This is the second scent that I own from Creed.... and I will tell you it my absolute favorite.. and I am a woman.... This scent is clean... crisp.. and I&#x27;m constantly complimented and asked what am I wearing!?... everytime I go out... I also own Creed Millesime Imperial.. another great unisex scent..... Their colognes are amazing... pure..potent. and worth the money... Vetiver DOES NOT smell like a christmas wreath.....so please ignore the review below... Creed makes so many fine scents... you must smell them in person to appreciate them...try it.. you won&#x27;t be sorry....</li>
    <li> Although this is a traditional men&#x27;s fragrance, I use it for the summer. It&#x27;s light, clean, and crisp smelling. I just love it!!!! I spray it in the morning and don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying throughout the day. You cannot beat this price either. Other places charge almost $400 for the same size.</li>
    <li> Consider Yes nice product no problem&lt;br /&gt;As request nice product&lt;br /&gt;No dislike with this product 100%&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product 100%</li>
    <li> Creed is ten times better at this price especially when its legit! Keep in mind Creed has changed their sprayers on the newr Aventus and Green Irish Tweed as I bought 2 bottles from Nieman Marcus to compare to and one had the new spayer and was informed its brand new from creed and is supposed to leak less than the mammoth spayers... This product has the old creed sprayer thats huge still..</li>
    <li> Is just a freaking water, nothing authentic about it!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wasted my money</li>
    <li> Great Service and item</li>
    <li> It do not smell like Vetiver. The fragance is very very light. You dont even knows it contains vetiver.</li>
