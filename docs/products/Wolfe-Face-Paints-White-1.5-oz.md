      <li>The glitter pallet is great too.  </li>
      <li>I have to say that I am really impressed with the consistency and how smooth the application is.</li>

      <li>Wolfe is arguably the best face/body paint and a good opaque, bright white is important to the pro facepainter.</li>
      <li>fast service and very good paint</li>
      <li>Wolfe Brothers has the most pigment from what I&#x27;ve found.</li>
      <li>that’s why most face painters use it mostly for linework.</li>
      <li>The best white face paint I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>I love love love wolfe-</li>
      <li>(Because some of the darker colors can stain the skin for a time, they are best used on younger skin.)</li>
      <li>If you apply two layers then its even better.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This works perfectly and lasts a long time!</li>

      <li>Great, solid coverage.</li>
      <li>Applies smooth and stays on.</li>
      <li>works great even when covering other colors.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly</li>
      <li>My company Face Paint Pittsburgh chooses Wolfe Face Paint first because it covers well, does not flake or peel, feels light like a woman&#x27;s foundation and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>They blend well, go on smoothly and cover the skin giving crisp, lean lines.</li>
      <li>Wolfe is the best for make up that is neither too oily or too tough to take off...covers well.</li>

      <li>Love this Wolfe White.</li>
      <li>I am a long time snazaroo user and I still love my snazaroo paints.</li>
      <li>The color goes on very opaque and has an effortless glide.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them for their vibrancy.</li>
      <li>A new product brings new life...</li>
      <li>Came quick and lasts a long time!</li>
      <li>I have used them consistently over the last 8 years.  </li>
      <li>I will definitely order again (most likely a larger size).</li>
      <li>You can paint a line of white across any other color and you still get a nice white line.</li>
      <li>As with all of the Professional Face Paints, read the labels.</li>
      <li>Took a chance on it arriving near the beginning of the delivery window, and lost on that one.  </li>
      <li>Many long time users have noticed it and complained to the company but they refuse to acknowledge that anything was changed.</li>
      <li>Among my various job discriptions is Professional Face Painter.</li>

<li> so well I immediately needed another plus black.</li>
<li> and it feels tight when it drys -  </li>
<li> All my other brands I let my kids play with because I find them useless, back-up.  </li>
<li> so it’s not great for using all over the face because it doesn’t allow the skin to breath as well as the lighter face paints (like Snazaroo, TAG and Paradise)</li>

    <li> Wolfe Brothers has the most pigment from what I&#x27;ve found. I use this for highlighting and outlines due to the pigment saturation works great even when covering other colors. Wolfe Brothers make Great Paints!!!</li>
    <li> Among my various job discriptions is Professional Face Painter. Wolfe Paints are not \\&quot;toys. As with all of the Professional Face Paints, read the labels. \\&quot;Wolfe Face Paints\\&quot; are one of the best for coverage.  They blend well, go on smoothly and cover the skin giving crisp, lean lines. (Not all the face paints do this.) I have used them consistently over the last 8 years.  (Because some of the darker colors can stain the skin for a time, they are best used on younger skin.) This White is one of Wolfe&#x27;s exceptions.  All are easily removed with \\&quot;baby wipes\\&quot; or soap and water; any color residue in time, will fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This white is a replacement; I was running out!  I highly recommend them for their vibrancy. This size is actually a stackable container - making storage of many colors easier to carry from job to job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paint arrived as promised and on time. I recommend the vendor as well.  The price was excellent for a Professional Face Paint that performs as well as Wolfe!</li>
    <li> fast service and very good paint</li>
    <li> Love this white, great coverage and blendability. Average price</li>
    <li> Love this Wolfe White. It definitely pops against other colors. I will definitely order again (most likely a larger size).</li>
    <li> I started on paradise and when my pallet ran low I ordered a wolfe pallet and a white then a black, then on to all other colors.  For awhile they were out of some colors and I needed restocking so I ordered a few other brands(snazaroo, kryolan, ben,mehron), I was done with paradise.  I love love love wolfe- It has great coverage, easy great control, does not glop, it holds up. I can go on and on.  All my other brands I let my kids play with because I find them useless, back-up.  The glitter pallet is great too.  The red and green are difficult to remove, the trace of spiderman and the hulk will remain the next day, this is true for a few brands.</li>
    <li> Goes on well. Great, solid coverage. Use water to blend.</li>
    <li> Wolfe has long been the go-to for black and white face paint for doing line work (because it stays opaque over other colors instead of blending in with other colors) BUT their formula has recently changed and is not as opaque as it used to be. Many long time users have noticed it and complained to the company but they refuse to acknowledge that anything was changed. Wolfe is also a waxy type of waterbased paint so it’s not great for using all over the face because it doesn’t allow the skin to breath as well as the lighter face paints (like Snazaroo, TAG and Paradise) and it feels tight when it drys -  that’s why most face painters use it mostly for linework.</li>
    <li> My company Face Paint Pittsburgh chooses Wolfe Face Paint first because it covers well, does not flake or peel, feels light like a woman&#x27;s foundation and dries quickly. For crisp line work this paint is ideal!</li>
    <li> love this paint!  my favorite white by wolfe</li>
    <li> The container is MUCH smaller than it appears in the photo.</li>
    <li> Facepainting is a breeze with this product. Applies smooth and stays on. Easy to remove with soap and water for the kids.</li>
    <li> Wolfe is the best for make up that is neither too oily or too tough to take off...covers well. I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I use this product at every face painting service gig I&#x27;m hired for. I&#x27;ve used other white face paints from different companys but always prefer this. The pigment is awesome. The color will stand out and not fade as quickly as other paints. If you apply two layers then its even better. When you get the correct water amount mixed in, this product will flow on the skin beautifully.</li>
    <li> Received hours after birthday party.  Took a chance on it arriving near the beginning of the delivery window, and lost on that one.  Good quality though.  Will keep it for the next face painting opportunity.</li>
    <li> I am a long time snazaroo user and I still love my snazaroo paints. For years snazaroo and krylon aqua color was the only option, however I recently went to a seminar that introduced me to the Wolfe line. I have to say that I am really impressed with the consistency and how smooth the application is. The color goes on very opaque and has an effortless glide. I cant see ever giving up my snazaroo because that&#x27;s what I learned with, but I will continue to add the Wolfe paints to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;This line has brought a breath of fresh air to face painting. A new product brings new life... I am very pleased with the Wolfe face paints and I definitely recommend them.. If you like these paints but need something that resists smear and sweat you should also try their alcohol based paints.</li>
    <li> Wolfe products are always the best. Came quick and lasts a long time!</li>
