<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The whole family uses these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From infants to grandparents. Great for rashes and sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;Works great for kids with rashes.</li>
    <li> This is a bit pricey but it keeps my skin soft and calms the irritation of my skin problem. Love it</li>
    <li> Recently, I&#x27;ve had dry, flaky, red, and very itchy skin.  My symptoms are very close to psoriasis.  This Eucerin Calming Creme was recommended by a relative, and (I must say) it is excellent.    I normally use it right after a shower (as recommended).  With the bit of moisture remaining on your skin, the creme spreads and works in very easily.  I suggest you apply the creme in small quantities (it&#x27;s quite rich, but not greasy feeling).  It moisturizes and soothes the skin immediately, and will leave your skin extremely smooth to the touch.  It relieves itch about as well as 1% hydrocortisone cream (another reviewer said this also).  It helps \\&quot;heal\\&quot; damaged skin also.    I&#x27;m not exaggerating; this stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;ve read the \\&quot;ingredients\\&quot; panel several times, and I&#x27;m not sure why this creme is so effective [no secret ingredients].  I guess these Eucerin folks just hit on a particularly good formula.    My skin is driest on my forearms, lower legs, and neck, so I apply the \\&quot;Calming Creme\\&quot; to these areas 2 times a day.  Otherwise, one application is good for the day.    I buy the 14 oz tube from a military retail outlet, so I save a tiny bit.  However, the 14 oz 2-pack Amazon sells (get the free shipping) has the best online price I&#x27;ve found (online prices are lower than regular retail).    UPDATE: Still using this in Jul 2011.  I&#x27;m able to use it only once a day, now, and I use slightly less than previously.  One thing I [think] I&#x27;ve noticed...when I apply to my face, it&#x27;ll give that area a slightly \\&quot;reddish cast\\&quot; for a while...like a reddish tinge...weird...my color does return to normal after a bit.  Not noticing any other effects [and, I suppose, this could be my imagination].</li>
    <li> I have been using this creme for a couple of years and I really love it.  It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, which is great if you&#x27;re like me and can&#x27;t stand the smell of most perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I have lichen planus and it really does help calm my skin itching immensely.</li>
    <li> Mom uses it on her legs after shaving so they don&#x27;t get itchy in the first place. Granma has this weird skin problem on her back that itches chronically &amp; says this stuff gives her instant relief. I have head-to-ankle histamine &amp;/or allergy problems &amp; have to use it all over every day. Also recommended for sunburn, poison ivy, &amp; bug bites. Sadly not that effective on friction burns. May work for hives. But whatever ail this doesn&#x27;t cure, you can always use Benadryl extra strength antihistamine spray.</li>
    <li> I use this for my dry, itchy legs. I am a nurse and work long shifts with knee socks on. I run home, shower, and put this incredible cream on my legs and feet.</li>
    <li> I have crazy sensitive skin prone to dermatitis, hives, itchies of all kinds. It&#x27;s also very dry. I have to moisturize every inch of myself after a shower--from hairline to tips of toes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since they seem to be discontinuing my longtime moisturizer by Lubriderm (seriously sensitive), I decided to give Eucerin a shot. It&#x27;s excellent and I&#x27;m adding it to my anti-skin-woes arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is rich. A very thick cream. Unless your skin is moist from a bath or shower, prepare to have to do a little muscular rubbing to spread it. However, after your shower or bath, when you&#x27;ve patted dry, but are still moist--this is perfect and smooths on richly but easily. Thick enough that a little goes a long way. Very moisturizing, even for my super dry heels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has no scent, not just because it&#x27;s less irritating that way (as many have allergies to scent/perfume), but it allows your own choice of perfume to shine and not be interefered with by a lotion&#x27;s scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A winner. Recommended for dry skin sufferers, especially the uber-sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
    <li> Every winter since I was a kid my skin on my hands would dry out so much that they would crack and bleed.  My mom used to put Vaseline on my hands and then cover them with white socks at night.  That was 0-k.  As an adult, I am not too fond of putting Vaseline and socks on my hands and have tried many different kinds of lotion.  Most of the time, lotions just make my  hands burn like crazy and I end up just washing it off.  That&#x27;s not how it is with Eucerin Calming Cream.  It does not make my hands burn and it moisturizes them very well.  It&#x27;s also nice because it doesn&#x27;t smell at all.  This is definitely a good purchase for anyone with dry sensitive skin.      Other dry skin tips:    1.  Wear gloves when washing dishes.  2.  Do not use soap in public bathrooms (anti-bacterial is horrible on your hands)  3.  Wear warm gloves when you go out into the cold.  4.  Put Eucerin on after you wash your hands.  5.  Keep a tube of Eucerin in the car.  6.  On the cracked places on your hands, put on a little Neosporin Plus Pain Relief (it helps)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, I can put it on in the morning after a shower and it helps with dry skin and calms that itch for the rest of the day.</li>
    <li> This product is hydrating, light and instantly calms the skin without overwhelming it with chemicals that other cremes have which tend to cause the skin to tingle and feel irritated. Highly recommended. I just wish it had a slight pleasant fragrance to it. But other than that I wouldn&#x27;t change a single ingredient! Oh and Wal-**** and K-**** sell this for $10.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. It has taken care of a few re-curring patches of dry skin I have had every winter. If I use it daily, they are undetectable, but if I skip a few, it seems to come back. It is very rich and the scent does not compete with perfume or other lotions.</li>
    <li> I love this product.   Even tho my skin doesn&#x27;t seem like its dry, in the winter it itches so bad that no amount of lotion takes the itch away.  Eucerin Dry Skin Theraphy Calming Creme works the first time you use it.  Totally takes the itch away right away.    Use it every day on the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; spots and every other day or so everywhere else.   This is a great product.  Sign up for automatic delivery and save some bucks.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> Bought for our 7-month-old who had very rough and itchy skin. After trying all kinds of creams (Cetaphil, Triple cream etc. etc.), we settled on this. Works great. Keeps the roughness and itching well under control.</li>
    <li> i love this cream. i used to use lubriderm for extra dry skin ,and then i tried this one, and what a difference! i did like lubriderm, over all i think it is very good but my skin is much softer now</li>
    <li> great for the skin especially in winter.  This moisturizes and feels great after a shower and will calm the skin from dry weather</li>
    <li> Ever since a few months ago, I&#x27;ve been cursed with a bad case of eczema/dermatitis, a.k.a. a really annoying rash (the lesson: beware of Lubriderm lotion).  A couple of powerful creams prescribed by a dermatologist (Triamcinolone Acetonide + Clobetasol Propionate) took care of matters on my body, but that stuff&#x27;s too strong for the face, so I was told to get something called Desonide, since Hydrocortisone (the common over-the-counter solution) wasn&#x27;t cutting it.  Even though Desonide is prescription-only, I searched for it on Amazon just for fun and stumbled upon this Eucerin Skin Calming Cream (ok, &amp;#34;Creme&amp;#34;).  I don&#x27;t see the connection, but I can report that it works well as a moisturizer, calms itching at least as well as Hydrocortisone does, and even smells pleasant despite being fragrance-free (can&#x27;t say that about Vaseline Men, to name one example).  The price is fair ($7 at Wal-Mart in case you want to try a single tube) and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any direct competitors, so I say bravo for working as advertised and for filling a niche that needed filling.  The only downside is that it increases breakouts on my face, but I was told to expect that with lotion in general.</li>
    <li> My baby always scratches her body and this cream does enough to soothe and relieve her from the itch.&lt;br /&gt;We just hope that we dont have to use it for years to come</li>
    <li> I use this a little bit but mostly I put it on my baby because she has eczema and it works wonderful. I&#x27;ve had an excellent experience with the product and I recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Even since 12 years ago I had an awful skin break out for some unknown reasons, my skin has become extremely dry and sensitive throughout these years.  I have tried all kinds of skin products, and Eucerin (particularly this cream) is the only one that helps.  The texture is thick and creamy.  The manufacturer did not add any unnecessary fragrance in the cream.  The moisture effect lasts for a whole day.  It is the best product out there for people who need professional help with their dry skin condition.  To get the best effect, it is the best to apply this product when your body is a little damp.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea which causes redness, itching and flaking on my nose, cheeks and chin.  My doctor prescribed Metrogel. It controlled the rosacea, but it is a topical antibiotic, can have some serious side effects and is quite expensive.  So, I asked my pharmacist what over-the-counter creams or lotions may be effective for treating skin irritations.  He recommended Eucerin Calming Cream so I bought some to try and it is working wonderfully.  I apply it twice daily and it controls the rosacea so well that my skin looks and feels normal. Try it.</li>
    <li> My daughter has eczema. I put this on her everyday after bath. It leaves her skin quite moisturized. Overall, I like the quality and of course the big tubes at this price.</li>
    <li> I had contact dermatitis and my dermatologist prescribed all sorts of creams and gels that left my skin greasy and did not relief the itch.  This lotion provided relief IMMEDIATELY and is all natural.  Absolutely sold on this product for life!</li>
    <li> This lotion is great for adults and kids without eczema. My daughter and I both use it and it&#x27;s definitely a nice rich thick lotion. However, we tried it on my son who has severe eczema after our pediatrician recommended it. It HURT my baby so bad that he screamed every single time we put it on. The medication in the lotion was causing his skin to sting and burn. Poor kid. So, we switched to Aveeno Baby Lotion for Eczema instead. Still a great product. Just not good for severe eczema.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy expensive creme because your skin will react to them due to perfume they put in there. I put olay creme on my face and it turned all red.     Eucerin creme is so rich, I love it, love it very much. Its so moisture and dissolve into your skin perfectly. My face has acne and it didn&#x27;t cause any break out AT ALL.     I love it.</li>
    <li> This is good for dry skin. It help my sister</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that between my husband and myself, we have three bottle of this stuff!  My husband has eczema and I have overly sensitive, dry skin so we have to be very careful about the lotions and potions we buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really the perfect lotion/creme.  It is thick enough to moisturize for hours, but doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy.  It keeps your skin soft all day and I love that it&#x27;s not scented.  It also doesn&#x27;t matter if you apply it right after a shower or throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff so much.  If you have sensitive skin or have other special needs, this is the only stuff you should use.</li>
    <li> Its such a great product! My skin has improved a lot since I purchased it. Its a must have for any person with eczema!</li>
    <li> The Eucerin Calming Creme is unscented and mild enough to use on sensitive, very dry, and eczema skin conditions.  It spreads very easily (unlike Vanicream which is much thicker and hard to spread but is recommended by many dermatologists).  However Eucerin leaves a slippery, oily feel on the skin surface.  I prefer Aveeno Active Naturals Skin Relief Moisture Repair Cream, which also is mild and unscented, but is completely absorbed and leaves no oily film, yet it relieves dryness and itch for about 12 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years. A doctor recommended two brands to me and I chose this brand to try. I&#x27;ve been with it ever since. It absorbs into the skin easily. If anyone has a sensitivity to perfumes this is the best product for you. It has no perfumes and is not greasy. If the area you apply the Creme becomes greasy your using to much. When skin is dry it&#x27;s uncomfortable and itchy. Eucerin Calming Creme used daily eliminates that discomfort. I also use it on some scars from a previous cellulitis infection. The scars will become painful unless moisturized daily and the Eucerin is safe to use without fear of causing another bout of infection. Because the Eucerin has no perfumes I don&#x27;t have to worry about an allergic reaction on the scarred areas aggravating an already sensitive spot.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s for the body, definitely not for your face. I tried it on my whole body, including my face, and while it does a good job of moisturizing dry skin, it burns your eyes and you spend the next day squinting in pain. Not that I put it IN my eyes, obviously, but it gives off vapors that penetrate during the night and you pay the price. Otherwise, it&#x27;s five stars. Now I have to find a cream that doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have never had a skin product cause so much pain.  After two applications my skin was bright red, puckered and felt like it was on fire.  I have sensitive skin but have never had such a toxic reaction as I did to this.</li>
    <li> I purchased this moisturizer for the dry winter months and now I&#x27;m hooked. I use it all year long. I get some really dry, scaly patches on my knees and this lotion gets rid of them. Calming creme goes on a bit thick and at first I was worried that I would be greasy, but it absorbs completely. I use this on my daughter, who has dry, sensitive skin, and she loves it and has had no adverse reactions to it. I would recommend this lotion to anyone. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This product meets all requirements for smooth comfort and many skin irritations. I don&#x27;t see where it is has any medicinal value other that just making me feel good.</li>
    <li> Very good product for sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve been using it now for the past 5 years on my children and it did wonders in healing eczema and moisturizing their sensitive skins.</li>
    <li> I wished I know this product sooner.. my skin getting smoother and not dry anymore. Love it! I really recommend this product..</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and ashy, especially in the winter. I like this lotion because it is thick enough to be effective but is still spreadable (unlike the standard Eucerin cream, which I find harder to apply than ultra-thick vaseline!) It&#x27;s on the higher end of the drugstore lotion brands, but not by too much. I try other brands, but I always come back to Eucerin calming creme.</li>
    <li> Very nice smooth daily body moisturizer without any smell but keep your body moist  all the time without sticky touch.</li>
    <li> I have a problem with my face becoming so dry it itches like crazy.  This is the only lotion I have found that works and doesn&#x27;t make my face itch from alergies to it.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and it takes a very small amount to cover the face.  I would reccommend this lotion for dry itchy and sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> GREAT STUFF FOR MOISTURIZING AGING SKIN, ESPECIALLY AFTER A SHOWER!  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS AFTER MY GP RECOMMENDED IT.</li>
    <li> I had tried the smaller tubes of this moisturizer and liked it very much. Was surprised to see Amazon selling the big tubes. Great price, huge convenient tubes and the moisturizer works very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I recently turned 30 and noticed that my skin was changing.  I was a little leary of the product as previous reviews had only discussed using it for serious skin conditions like eczema.  However, my skin was beginning to dry out and appear cracked and aged under my makeup (and without).  I first tried several different creams before this one, including well known and highly recommended brands like neutrogena, Loreal, etc.  I, of course, tried hydrating.  None of them ultimately worked.  Finally it was explained to me that it was not that my skin needed moisture per se but that my skin needed to retain its natural moisture.  I started using this product about a month ago with great results.  I can tell a difference when I look in the mirror and have received compliments as well.  I would NOT wear this under make-up, as previous reviews have stated, it is more oily and greasy than other moistures and must be worked into the skin.  Thus it is not a daytime moisturizer.  However, I used it every night just after showering.  It is relatively light weight (there is a slight oily texture but I have quickly become used to it and it isn&#x27;t enough to make me consider not using it).  If worked into skin properly, skin does not appear shiny or oily (recently engaged so I am concerned about my nighttime appearnce as well). I would recommended this to others and intend to continue to use it.  Great lotion!</li>
    <li> This does the job on winter-dry hands, with no scent, no allergic reactions, no greasy feel. Even the menfolk use it.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion works for me.  I have a disease that tightens my skin and this lotion makes my skin feel good.</li>
    <li> A wonderfull handcream and calming. It is worth and necessary to sooth our dry hands. I love the item I bought</li>
    <li> Surprised by overall five star.. I have eczema on hands and fingers, and psoriasis on arms. This is,by far, the worst lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. It made my skin sticky and drier, if that&#x27;s at all possible!</li>
    <li> I have exceptionally dry skin and this cream is a bit heavier, but not greasy.  It is wonderful especially during the winter.</li>
    <li> Since I had my last child (5 years ago) my skin became very sensitive. My face was always red, dry, itchy and hot. I&#x27;ve tried many different things, from cosmetic moisturizer to strong medicines and nothing seemed to help very much.   I saw this product in a magazine, read many reviews here at Amazon and decided to try. Amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it from about 3 weeks and my skin is completely different: no more redness, burning or itchy. It looks like a baby face (not so, but almost!). I am really happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Need this creme  for my sensitive skin. It calms my skin as described, and I&lt;br /&gt;keep this on hand, especially during the warm months. This is a great value!!!</li>
    <li> An excellent product which my wife loves. It does the jobs intended, is soft and smooth, and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter who has eczema.  It actually helps as much as the prescription cortizone cream does.</li>
    <li> Our house hold rarely agree on anything! Me, my wife and teenage daughter like this and finally agree on something!</li>
    <li> With the help of my doc I tried out several creams and remedies over the period of one year in order to cope my problem of dry and itchy skin. During my stay last June in the States I detected this product in a drugstore. As the Tradename &amp;#34;Eucerin&amp;#34; is from Germany I was curious enough and bought the product in order to try it out. After round about three months my skin was &amp;#34;repaired&amp;#34; and all the problems solved. As this product in spite of german origin is not available in Germany, amazon was a real help for me. Thank you!</li>
    <li> For the past two years I&#x27;ve had atopic dermatitis on my face - itchy, red, bumpy, dry, scaly - and the only thing that could get rid of it was a steroid ointment that I got from my dermatologist. However, the dermatitis would come right back as soon as I stopped the steroid treatment, and I can&#x27;t use steroids constantly (or much at all.) So, I tried various things - Cerave, Cetaphil, Purpose Soap, Clinique products - nothing even slightly helped my dry itchy skin. I started using Eucerin&#x27;s Skim Calming Creme (along with their face wash) a couple weeks ago, and it has completely gotten rid of the dermatitis. The itch went away as soon as I put it on, and now the bumps, dryness, and most of the redness are gone too. I think my skin even looks better than it did before all this started. I wish I&#x27;d known about this sooner! I put a little on in the morning under my makeup, and more on at night before I go to bed. Love love love this product.</li>
    <li> Huge tubes will last forever - and in a pack of two, plus subscribe &amp; save pricing, this is a great product at a great price! Very good for sensitive skin, &amp; not greasy at all.</li>
    <li> I like this product because if does not leave my skin feeling sticky. It helps with  my very dry skin.</li>
    <li> This item is a staple at our home.  We were able to round out our order with this item so we really appreciate your haveing it in stock.  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> This skin creme is wonderful and very healing.  It was a great bargain for the size of the tubes.  Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy... it almost numbs the itchy winter skin too. This is a LOT of lotion, enough for a family.</li>
    <li> Hands down, I love this creme.  It totally does the trick on that itchy winter skin. A very good value.</li>
    <li> Having had some significant eczema problems over recent years and going through a lot of creme, I purchased this.  It comes in a larger tube than most brands and is less expensive.  It helps a lot when you are applying a lot or applying frequently.  It is not greasy and is readily absorbed.  If the itching is really bad and you don&#x27;t want to use cortisone, I found Neosporin Eczema Essentials daily creme worked better but it does have a more of a residue.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff.  It&#x27;s the first time my hands have been soft and smooth in years.</li>
    <li> Recently I was told by my dermatologist I needed to use a moisturizer. I received the names of four brands, which I bought, and of those narrowed it down to two, Eucerin and Cetaphil. [[ASIN:B001ET7A4K Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion, 8.0-Ounce Tubes(Pack of 2)]] I like both and alternate them. I would say Eucerin feels just a bit \\&quot;heavier\\&quot; than Cetaphil but not so much that i don&#x27;t like it. I see it  contains oatmeal but to me the feel of it is smoother and lighter than Aveeno, which also contains oatmeal. [[ASIN:B0016S0Y4M Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion Twin Set - 18 oz (2 PACK)]] The Aveeno is not too heavy, though, and I keep it in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> great product, keeps my hands silky smooth, no more dryness and chaping and painful, would suggest it to all my friend</li>
    <li> This product is great for my sons eczema. I have used it on him since he was maybe 6 months old...never bought anything else but this. is has kept his skin wonderfully smooth with not so many breakouts. (after all it is eczema and cannot be prevented by lotion) PLUS my son is nearly 2 now and he stepped on a sticky mouse trap bare foot and i put this lotion on his foot and the sticky came right off of his foot! that makes me a happy mommy!</li>
    <li> Purchasing for a friend in a nursing home who has dry, sensitive skin. This is the only cream she can use and works well for her.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helped out with my dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> The best skin cream....always have trouble with my skin and now using Eucerin I don&#x27;t.  love this product.  Great packaging and fast delivery.....thank you</li>
    <li> Excellent product for people with allergic dermatitis.  Goes on smoothly, is scent free, disappears, not greasy, and provides total relief for those of us with eczema and other skin irritations.  I use in on full body twice a day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after having a bad case of hand eczema, which then spread to other areas of my body.  I found this creme to be really thick and slippery.  After putting it on, I felt very sticky and when applying it to my hands, I found that the creme actually melted into a liquid that didn&#x27;t seem like it was being absorbed.  After running my hands under water, you could see where the creme re-solidfied, leaving white residue on my hands.  After seeing a second dermatologist, he strongly suggested using CeraVe moisturizing lotion.  I definitely found the CeraVe to be a better product (at least for my purposes).  It was very light and soothing and it absorbed really well.  So if you&#x27;re looking for something thicker, this creme is for you.  If you&#x27;re looking for something light and soothing, I suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001FB5IN2 Eucerin Dry Skin Therapy Calming Creme, 14 Ounce Tubes (Pack of 2)]]It feels great on dry, itchy, skin. I like it after a bath and especially before bedtime.</li>
    <li> very good product leave your body feels smooth&lt;br /&gt;if you have a dry skin use Eucerin skin calming moisturizing creme</li>
    <li> I love this product but i am not happy with the price.amazon charging more than walmart. i am surprised when i saw the price in walmart. please do not waste your money. best product to buy but not at amazon.</li>
    <li> Very hydrating and not greasy! I have very sensitive skin and need a good moisturizer in the winter.  This is my favorite!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this lotion if you have very dry skin. It works great in the winter and keeps you moisturized all day on a budget. No fragrance; so don&#x27;t expect to smell &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; from it. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> great for dry skin, nice and calming but feels a bit sticky -- my boyfriend uses it too but he complains my skin is sticky.  Maybe I&#x27;m applying too much.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve found for itchy skin condition.</li>
    <li> Quickly softens skin without feeling greasy.</li>
    <li> I noted that many people complained about how difficult it is to squeeze everything out of the very firm tube.  I cut one open and was amazed to see how much was left in what I thought was an empty tube.  So, now I cut every tube open and scrape all of the cream into a round container.  It&#x27;s so easy to use that way and no waste either.  They package one of their products in a tub and I wish they would package this one that way.</li>
    <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
    <li> Works well on my cracked, eczema hands.  I don&#x27;t get bleeding - just very cracked top layer.  It cools,  and soothes, without stinging.  Best thing - no greasiness whatsoever - hate that about other eczema products.  Absorbed by skin within a couple minutes.  Doesn&#x27;t cure eczema - it&#x27;s for soothing,  and does that well.</li>
    <li> Eucerin&#x27;s Calming Creme is a rich, non-greasy moisturizer that is great for daily use. It&#x27;s non-irritating and fragrance free and contains oatmeal to help heal dry, itchy skin. It can be used for children ages 2 and up.  Dermatologist recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream on my 2 year old son.  He tends to get minor rashes on his stomach, is very sensitive to tags on clothing and will scratch and itch behind his neck and the lower part of his back until it bleeds :(  This lotion turned out to be EXACTLY what we needed!  I&#x27;ve been trying all sorts of different products, but this one is the first to have really made a difference!</li>
    <li> Hands down the best lotion for keeping dry skin moisturized.  Just be careful not to use it on an open wound because it stings.  But by far you can&#x27;t compare the lasting results from this.  It&#x27;s the BEST lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Best product I have found for any kind of skin irritation or rash.  Soothing and rather light though I would recommend covering with powder if you do not like a slight greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this cream it is a very good product</li>
    <li> Never had a problem when Eucerin sold their Original Creme, used it for eye makeup removal as well as a facial moisturizer.  Sadly I cannot use their Original Healing Soothing Repair Creme or this Calming Creme without a horrible reaction, i.e, severe redness with burning and extremely dry skin over my entire face. My dermatologist has given me many samples of various moisturizers, etc., to no avail, and has had to give me Steroids on more than one occasion after my severe reactions.</li>
    <li> Big the tube, used to be very moist, enough for the whole family to use an entire winter it.My wife liked.</li>
    <li> If you care for your skin quality, this lotion keeps the skin smooth and prevent excess drying that causes itching and eczema. I have used other similar cremes but they a seemed to fall short. This formula works for me. I&#x27;m a senior and my skin use to itch to the point of bleeding.</li>
    <li> I have heard others describe this creme as a miracle, however it just didn&#x27;t work all that well for me.</li>
    <li> This lotion is the only one that treats my Eczema.  It is wonderful!  It is a little thicker than a regular lotion, but it will heal your skin in days, not weeks! Obsessed!</li>
    <li> I suffer from eczema and have done my entire life (I&#x27;m now 31). I struggle to find lotions and cremes that I don&#x27;t react to but also ones that are at a decent price. This product is perfect and I have never had a breakout since discovering it over 4 years ago. I would recommend to anyone who suffers from dry flaky skin but also anyone who has eczema to try this product.</li>
    <li> I have been having very itchy dry skin.  After using the Eucerin Calming Daily Moisturizing Cream 2X, the itching has stopped and the skin isn&#x27;t dry as it was before.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best moisturizer I have ever used on my face. I have seborrheic dermatitis so I&#x27;m quite finicky when it comes to moisturizers as they either cause flare ups or give me breakouts. I have tried &#x27;em all, even the oil-free ones; none served their purpose until this one. I love the consistency of this product, not too thick (like Cetaphil creme) but not too light (like Kiehl&#x27;s). It goes on smoothly as you apply it too your face and absorbs really quick. Most of all, it doesn&#x27;t just sit on top of your face like most moisturizers. It continues to work throughout the day as my face feels so smooth and soft after washing my face at night. I will definitely purchase this product again in the future. Thanks Eucerin for giving us this amazing product!</li>
    <li> This skin cream was recommended to me by my dermatologist for everything -- face, body, hands, and feet -- and it is the best general cream that I have ever used.  As I grow older and older, my skin gets drier and drier, and I need more and more skin cream.  This is non-allergenic, non-scented, non-gooey and generally great stuff.  Even my husband uses it, a lot, with no complaint.</li>
    <li> This is the only cream that works for me.  This creme was recommended to me by a friend, thank you Janet!</li>
    <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin, and so does my daughter. It&#x27;s common knowledge around my household that using the wrong detergent or hand/body lotion could result in itchy, rashy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is the only thing that soothes and moisturizes my skin while maintaining a balance of a thick consistency that&#x27;s creamy, yet light enough that I can immediately feel my skin soft and smooth after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also gentle enough to use on my 2 1/2 year old daughter. My dermatologist recommended this product, for both myself and my daughter (I started using this on her at a year old). I&#x27;ve never used anything else since. I&#x27;m a very happy customer, 3 years and going. I even recommended a friend of mine who suffers from Eczema to try it. It even soothes her skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason why this product is so valuable is simple: It contains natural oatmeal and several sources of rich moisturizers. It soothes irritated skin, even after pesky razor burn. It also prevents my skin from becoming dry, cracked and itchy. I love that this product is fragrance free, because perfumes and dyes commonly irritate sensitive skin. It&#x27;s dermatologically tested, and the brand I trust for me and my daughter&#x27;s skincare.</li>
    <li> This lotion was so slippery. I loved how much is moistened my scaly armpits. It works great on my feet to.</li>
    <li> i have eczema pretty bad, i put this stuff on the inflamed skin on my face and neck and I was surprised at the burning sensation i had afterwards.  it wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it was there.  i dont know how a cream that is supposed to calm skin makes it burn?  the burning is probably due to the cetyl alcohol they have in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe its only for the body?  i dunno.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product all the time to my mommy friends. We started using it about 4 years ago when my daughter (autistic) began having sensitive skin issues. This product has a minimal scent and goes on smooth. After shower/bath is the perfect time to slather it on!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin for years and recently started using this one for my face since I was diagnosed with Rosacea.  Originally, my derm had me use a different cream, but my face was still dry and since changing to this one it&#x27;s much better.  I would recommend Eucerin products to anyone and everyone even with derm issues.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly ten years.  It is the best I have found for sensitive, diabetic skin.  I just switched to buying it on Amazon instead of the local drug store.  Much better deal especially when you qualify for free shipping.</li>
    <li> long lasting &amp; soothing&lt;br /&gt;not greasy&lt;br /&gt;wonderful on my young daughters dry skins&lt;br /&gt;helps w/her dry patches during the allergy seasons</li>
    <li> This lotion is great!  Its gentle, even on my baby&#x27;s skin, moisturizes great, and isn&#x27;t too thick.  We all love this product!</li>
    <li> I had this but needed more and this is a great price I paid $10 for one tub and you get 2 for $13 it really helps with summer time and winter time itchies.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lotion and I was pleased to find the less expensive multi packs. Excellent lotion at a lower price</li>
    <li> My skin gets really dry and itchy.  I love this lotion.  It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I hate greasy lotion.</li>
    <li> Very nice; good stuff.  My husband and I both use it.  It really helps our skin.  We will order it again.</li>
    <li> My legs have shown a lo of skin damage after a couple bad infections. It makes the skin soft. No harsh smell. Has added to the overall look and feel</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Eucerin products for awhile because of my rosacea problems. Most lotions make me feel like I just applied acid to my skin because they inflame my rosacea so bad, but since Eucerin products are made with sensitive skin in mind it always it absolutely perfect. I have chronic dry skin on my cheeks and hands and this soothes the irritation and moisturizes my skin really well without causing rashes or burning. I also use it alongside aloe after I use my epilator to calm the redness and make my legs super soft. Love it! Haven&#x27;t found a Eucerin product I don&#x27;t love yet.</li>
    <li> I experienced very itchy skin in winter 2008 until I had to see a specialist (dermatologist). I do not have skin problem in other season (spring till fall). As a self-employed, my health insurance is high deductable and I ended up paying $150 for the visit. The doctor said my skin is sensitive to dry winter weather and gave me a desonide cream (Rx) and Eucerin. The key of fix itchy skin is to take short (less than 10 min) warm (not hot) shower and apply Eucerin immediately. This suggestion works for my skin. Note that each person  has different skin condition, so my suggestion may not work for everyone.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but eucerin has a better product for dry skin. If you notice at the bottom, it has something that looks like drops for their rating on thickness. I would get the one with all 5 drops if you frequently have dry hands do to hand washing or if you have problems with eczema.</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used for almost 3 years. It is good to calm down my skin every day.</li>
    <li> I get really bad winter dryness on my legs, which prompts eczema if left untreated.  Using this two-three times a day makes it so I never have to worry.  It&#x27;s also good after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little liquidy, but it&#x27;s super moisturizing and absorbs quickly into my skin.  The fragrance is very light and just smells like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this to everyone as a daily moisturizer, and I continue to buy it when I run out.</li>
    <li> My wife and daughter were using when were living in the US. Too bad its not available in Australia. Even if shipping is a bit expensive its worth it.</li>
    <li> really big size , but one for the baby, one for the mom, both of them fit, win win ,thanks</li>
    <li> I first purchased for dry, irritated skin with very good results and have since repurchased several times. Recently used on inflamed, irritated skin with minor swelling as a result of a mild allergic reaction from gardening i.e. dry conditions, pollen, dust from dried plants and vines. I rinsed the skin area with warm water and applied a small, appropriate amount of Eucerin Creme. The itchiness subsided almost immediately and the swelling was gone in a few hours.</li>
    <li> This is one of my go-to lotions and creams when my skin is especially dry, or I have a bad eczema flare up. It&#x27;s minimally greasy, and it really is calming. I use it over Cetaphil, Aveeno, and CereVe when I need the big guns.</li>
    <li> As a moisturizer I have to admit it&#x27;s pretty good, but if you are concerned about being exposed to toxins such as parabens, avoid this lotion.  I was wondering if I could use this on my 3 year old with eczema and started looking at the ingredients. It contains methylparaben and ethylparaben.  I won&#x27;t use this on myself now that I&#x27;m aware of it (funny how I didn&#x27;t pay much attention when I was using this on myself post pregnancy).  The back of the container states that it is appropriate for children over 2, but I would avoid using it on children altogether.</li>
    <li> This lotion I use primarily for tattoo aftercare because it is fragrance free and goes on fairly light. Not as light as some lotions (like Lubriderm&#x27;s fragrance free lotion), but that&#x27;s OK when the skin is healing, you want a little more coverage. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I burned my face from using too much proactiv toner. The next morning my face was all over in red burns, and I couldn&#x27;t look at myself in the mirror without crying. It was HORRIBLE. I had no idea how I was gonna go to school with that horrible looking face with so many burn marks! It looked like my face was chewed on by a zombie, REALLY that bad! I am a girl in my late teens btw. So then someone suggested eucerin to me to use for my kind of burns, and I was like, okay I&#x27;ll give it a try. ONE DAY of using this on my burns every couple of hours, just ONE DAY and my face looked a whole lot better! I was surprised and AMAZED just how much this creme helped me in ONE DAY! Love it, love it, love it! It&#x27;s really good for burns! It will burn your face a little bit though, but it&#x27;s still effective! After a couple days&#x27; use, your burns will start to peel off, which is good. When you peel them off, there&#x27;s new skin underneath, but you should keep using eucerin until touching that skin feels not painful at all, because it will peel more than once if you are applying eucerin to a burn. Good creme! THANK YOU EUCERIN for helping me with my burns!!! Life saver!</li>
    <li> Have used a number of these kinds of products, each serves its purposes for me quite well. Glad to have this Eucerin in my anti-eczema arsenal.</li>
    <li> I am pregnant and have extremely itchy skin. Nothing worked to relieve the itch, until my doctor recommended that I try this lotion. I bought a small one to start just incase it didn&#x27;t work. It works great. It relieves the itch within five minutes of application. I am so happy that I found something that works.</li>
    <li> I have eczema and sometimes my skin breaks out in a painful, itchy rash.  This cream does the job.  Once I put it on after being particularly inflamed and it burned for a few minutes.  I was afraid it would not soothe, but it did and I felt a lot of relief once the cream absorbed into my skin.  It would probably be great for children, too.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy.</li>
    <li> I had a accident in 2009 and almost had my leg removed. I have to have a creme that keeps my legs hydrated or I could have skin break down. When I was in the hospital I saw Eucerin in every room and all the staff seem to use it and I asked if it was really that good. I got thumbs up all the way around. When I went tot he wound clinic for 5 mos they to used Eucerin. I have used it daily since mar 2009 and my skin is in the best shape. (I used to have horrible dry skin) I have left the cap off and picked it up the next aday and after being open to the air for over 24 hours it was still usable and was the same as normal. I would recommend this for anyone but especially for comromised skin.</li>
    <li> This product has parabens.  I won&#x27;t purchase again as I don&#x27;t like using products that contain parabens. This is not  bad for moisturizing purposes, but not as good as Cetaphil Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This a good lotion especially for people who suffer from dry, sensitive skin and/or eczema. It is very thick and keeps my skin moisturized for a long time. Because there is no scent added, the lotion itself smells a bit like wet cardboard, but that smell goes away pretty quickly after applying it. I recommend waiting a few minutes between putting this lotion on and getting dressed because even if you rub it in, it takes a minute to sink in, and will get on your clothes if you get dressed right away. I have yet to find a lotion I like more.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t pay attention to the ounces - they&#x27;re huge!  Very helpful for my mom&#x27;s extra dry skin during her chemo treatments.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisturizer.  Would be great if they came out with some tint in it!</li>
    <li> on my face, after I wash it, while it is still wet, trapping moisture. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or remain overly greasy. Nice soothing lotion, just as it says.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful for dry skin;my dermatologist recommends it highly.  As a bonus, I&#x27;ve used a very light application of it as a facial moisturizer.  Normal price of a single 14 oz. tube is $14.99 at CVS, drugstore.com, and Walgreens.</li>
    <li> buy it because my wife could not stand the itching in the body and it was a blast..Good options .</li>
    <li> I purchased this product this winter and I&#x27;m glad I did. I have to be choosy on what brand I use for my hand as they sting easily when I used other widely known brands. I will purchase this again. I had a good deal as well.</li>
    <li> I have sensative dry skin and this lotion works well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I would highly recommend purchasing this lotion.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer, especially for the cold, dry winter months although I use it year-round. Love the convenience of a subscription.</li>
    <li> I got this at the suggestion of my son&#x27;s pediatrician, he has some dry patches on his little head and on his arm that don&#x27;t want to go away, but this lotion helps soften his baby skin!</li>
    <li> I really should subscribe to this product as I purchase it regularly for my Mom.  It does as it promises; and, is a great product for my Mom.  It does soothe her itchy skin areas.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack from Amazon as my wife uses it regularly, and Amazon sells it at a good rate! It came delivered as promised, with 2 wrappings over the product; one shrink wrapped for individual bottles, another air-tight bag for each pack of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has eczema, so this body cream is a life saver for her, in a relatively humid country, in Singapore.</li>
