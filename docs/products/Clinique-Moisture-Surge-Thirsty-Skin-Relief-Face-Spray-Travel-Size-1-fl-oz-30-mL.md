    <li> I used this until my jar of moisture surge came in. Does the job of moisturizing. Very convienent and cute. I would use short term (for travel or whatever)</li>
    <li> this was my fist time useing this product and i really liked it. a must have for anyone that wears face powder.</li>
    <li> I bought this on recommendation from a friend who loves it and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with or without wearing make-up. It is so refreshing! My face gets dry during the day and all I have to do is spray a few times with this and I&#x27;m moisturized again. It won&#x27;t mess up your make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it to anyone who has dry skin or if you need a moisture burst in the winter.</li>
    <li> I tried it as soon as I got it&lt;br /&gt;It made my skin burn a little but to be fair I have very very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Dry skin, so I ordered and keep on my desk. I really like the benefits instant moisture, perfect size great price and fast shipper.</li>

    <li> Great to carry in hand bag I place it in fridge the night before to get it cold .With the heat this is great to keep my face hydrated throughout the day.</li>
    <li> you might as well put some water in a bottle and spray it on your face...sorry, I wanted to like this but it was useless :((</li>
    <li> very good thing.I bought it for my journey.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a fast refresher while on the road or flying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice and I like it. Only thing is its really small I thought it would be a bit bigger.</li>
    <li> When it came it was not in an official clinque box a part of me thinks I was hoodwinked and they just put water in a spray bottle</li>
    <li> It says THIS ITEM IS NOT FOR INDIVIDUAL SALE! And to be honest it s kinda expensive for a tiny little bottle...doesn&#x27;t have any scent....</li>
    <li> Excellent product as most of the Clinique things,</li>
    <li> I love Clinique products. This one is a must-have for traveling. Leaves yous skin feeling fresh and baby soft. I used if over make-up several times. Worked just fine as well.</li>

    <li> Does nothing for my face at all. Feels like I&#x27;m spraying water on it.  Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
    <li> Not impressed. Does not nourish skin. Seems like it is just shimmer and water. You can&#x27;t spray to much or else your face will be full of shimmer after only a couple sprays. I can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> i really do like this facial spray. it feels really good when i spray it on my face. i would like some time to get a full size spray.</li>
