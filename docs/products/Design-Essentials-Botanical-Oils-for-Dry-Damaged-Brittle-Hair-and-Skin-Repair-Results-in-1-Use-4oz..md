      <li>It left my hair looking really silky.  </li>
      <li>This oil is just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; to me so far.</li>
      <li>It keeps my hair really soft, moist and manageable.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product because a hairdresser used some Designer Essential products on my hair that left my hair so soft and silky that it seemed like the whole texture of my hair had changed.</li>
      <li>I do think its worth mentioning that even though I read the details I was still a little surprised by the amount of product.</li>

    <li> This product is great and helps to keep my hair moisturized.  I use it daily.</li>
    <li> This oil is not at all heavy. After putting it on, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you dipped your head in Crisco.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because a hairdresser used some Designer Essential products on my hair that left my hair so soft and silky that it seemed like the whole texture of my hair had changed. I have been trying to achieve that same results at home, but so far haven&#x27;t able to. This oil is just &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; to me so far. However, if I start getting better results, I will gladly update my review.</li>
    <li> Great product at great price</li>

    <li> This oil is just okay, a bit too heavy for me.  I would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I was a lil skeptical buying this, because it&#x27;s an &#x27;oil&#x27;. I thought it would leave my hair heavy and greasy.....surprisingly not! It leaves the hair moisturized yet light! Smells great too. I&#x27;ll be buying this again. It&#x27;s the only thing i&#x27;ll be using from now on.</li>
    <li> Excellent product with an excellent price. I was told that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find this product for less than $20...wrong. I love this oil for my hair and I love the fact that I paid way less than the salon. The product was as described and it was on time shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I am mix with  black and Panamena. .I truly love this oil ,  smell so good and just need a small amount.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy at all . Thank You ♡</li>
    <li> I was disappoiinted that the product was not in a sealed bottle.  When I made the puchase it said i was getting a new bottle, but it appeared to have been used.  There was no seal around the cap instead it was a small piece of clear scotch tape taped over the top of the cap from left to right as if to keep the squirt area from leaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product because my hairdresser uses it on my hair and I like the results.  However, I can&#x27;t buy it from her because it can only be bought through a vendor that sells to the hairstylist in northern Virginia. This led to my amazon search and I was pleased when I found it for $11+ given that my sister says she buys it from her stylist in Atlanta for $20.00.  However, I was disappointed with this purchase as I don&#x27;t know whether what&#x27;s in the used bottle is the real deal or some other oily crap.  Real disappointment!</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s light weight and works wonders on my hair. Last a long time. Great product</li>
    <li> feels good in my hair.</li>
    <li> Just a little is all you need. I went from putting heat on my hair on a daily basis to once a week, and my hair still looks great.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this oil.  I am in cosmetology school and they gave a demonstration.  They gave out several free gift with some of thier products and this was one that was in my gift box.  This stuff really works.  All you need is just a little and your hair will shine.  I tried it on my hair and normally any oil I have used before has my hair dried out by the next day.  This one didn&#x27;t.  It left my hair looking really silky.  I even tried it on my bleach blonde manekin which was damaged from bleach and a permanent wave I put on it and it left her hair witho some shine too.  I have tried oil sheens, glosses, waxes and nothing has worked as well as this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product! It makes my hair smell wonderful and my hair hasnt been dry or frizzy since I&#x27;ve started using it. I do think its worth mentioning that even though I read the details I was still a little surprised by the amount of product. It was not a lot, which is something that I&#x27;ve noticed about all of the design essential products that I&#x27;ve tried. Oh- and side warning! Make sure the lid is tight or you&#x27;ll be buying a whole new bottle, like me! :)</li>
    <li> I use this product daily and I still have enough for at least 2 weeks.  It was delivered 11/17/2013 and I will place an order sometime this week.  5 months!  Great shine, tames the frizz and my hair is never oily.</li>
    <li> This oil is good to use on your hair and body. It&#x27;s not to greasy. The smell if the oil is okay.</li>
    <li> I love Design Essentials products, but this one is not a keeper.  The oil is not rich like some other oils have have purchased in the past, and the smell is awful.  Maybe it had a bad reaction to my skins&#x27; chemistry because when using it on my body it just started smelling a bit rancid.&lt;br /&gt;It also does not melt into you hair like it should...it just sits on top, leaving your hair feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with my Jamaican Oil, it smells great and leaves my hair feeling moisturized.</li>
    <li> Love this product, my beautician uses it on my hair and I needed to get another bottle asap!</li>
