<li> I liked it except if its not heated properly, it clings to your skin and difficult to remove !!</li>
<li> bad thing I can say is that you need to make sure that you get a wax warmer that heats up to the proper temperature.</li>
<li> I have very coarse, dark hair.  </li>
<li> My wife of course needed this to go along with the Belle Pink Depilatory Roll on Wax Heater</li>
<li> and they are too dark and noticeable.</li>
<li> I got dark patches on my skin after I waxed from this and the marks are not going.</li>
<li> Not strong enough for thick, course hair.</li>
<li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
<li> Too sticky, not easy to use</li>
<li> Too thick, even after heating, threw it away.</li>
<li> Wax is too thick.  </li>
<li> This time was very thick</li>
<li> not happy with this product</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t work, poor quality.</li>
<li> Overall very disappointed.</li>
<li> Not happy at all with this product!</li>
<li> , i had a very tough time getting rid of this.</li>
<li> Worst things ever.  </li>
<li> They are just horrible.</li>
<li> so bad it is like gum !!</li>
<li> and this is the worst.</li>

    <li> This wax is just perfect!! very gentle on the skin and very effective in removing even short hair!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
    <li> Much more cleaner than using one of those tub-like waxes and wax warmers, but won&#x27;t get rid of more stubborn hair.</li>
    <li> I use this cartrige along with the Triple Roll On Depilatory Electric Wax Heater Warmer and I love it!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue buying it... leaves my skin so soft and take all the hair out!!!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse, dark hair.  This worked great on my skin with a light dusting of powder and paper strips.</li>
    <li> This wax is awesome. I bought it to use at home but my wax lady uses it all the time. I have sensitive skin so this wax helps.&lt;br /&gt;Only bad thing I can say is that you need to make sure that you get a wax warmer that heats up to the proper temperature. I am still looking for a new one because the one that I bought left the wax too cool and not easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Too sticky, not easy to use</li>

    <li> easy to use, very cost effective all the ladies in my house use it and it has stood the test of time.</li>
    <li> I took one month before I review this product. I got dark patches on my skin after I waxed from this and the marks are not going. I thought they would fade way but it&#x27;s been 1 month but the marks are still there and they are too dark and noticeable. Will never use this product again.</li>
    <li> Works well. Just need advice on clean up!</li>
    <li> not happy with this product</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with this product! What a waste of time and money.</li>

    <li> This wax works great for legs and hands.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best i ever tried - soft and gentle.. So, I love it.</li>
    <li> This is good for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Worst things ever.  Roller doesn&#x27;t work good.  Wax is too thick.  They are just horrible.</li>
    <li> This time was very thick</li>
    <li> This is probably my most preferite type of wax. Gentle and soft, it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you take it off from the skin</li>
    <li> I have used many types of wax bfr and this is the worst. It sticks on skin like glue. I used diff things like oil, wipes, soap, scrub etc and the wax is still there. My underarms stick and it hurts to move my hands!! Also it does not remove hair from roots so u feel stubble. Previously whenever i waxed i would have smooth skin. After waxing with this one it feels like it does 2 days after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing good about it is the convenience of rolling. Overall very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I thought it would be water soluble and it was not, but otherwise I guess wax is wax and takes hair off.</li>
    <li> Its very good this product</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really cheap and the quality is good. It says for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s true. You should buy it</li>
    <li> Not strong enough for thick, course hair.</li>
    <li> We have bought this many times, ladies in my home loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife of course needed this to go along with the Belle Pink Depilatory Roll on Wax Heater but as a system she loves it!</li>
    <li> i might be the only one but my skin comes off complete.ly with this stuff.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, poor quality.</li>
    <li> Even when i used it at very low temperatures, this wax left my skin burned and hurting for the coming 1 week, which is very unusual for a wax. It left dark patches on my skin after use, and within a week, my skin was more tanned than it ever was. Its probably because of the chemicals they use in the wax, but I definitely do not recommend it. Oh,and this was sticks to your skin like gum, i had a very tough time getting rid of this.</li>
    <li> Very nice and easy to use wax. Pleasant and comparably easy to apply and take off.</li>
    <li> Delivered in more than a month but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
