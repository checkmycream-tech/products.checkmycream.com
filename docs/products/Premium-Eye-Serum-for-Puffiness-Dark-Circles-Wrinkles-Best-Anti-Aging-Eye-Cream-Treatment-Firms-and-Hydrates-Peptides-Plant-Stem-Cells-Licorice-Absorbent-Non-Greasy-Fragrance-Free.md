<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like the product but I don&#x27;t see miracle results with the skin tone and dark circles under my eyes, yet I do think it is a great eye lift moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Worked great until my eczema rejected it</li>
    <li> The product feels smooth and I&#x27;ve been using it 3 times a day, but as of yet I don&#x27;t see much progress. I&#x27;ll update this review in a few weeks. I would give it 5 stars except that since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;m much more inclined to wake up with flaky or &amp;#34;sleepies&amp;#34; bits in my eyelashes...you know, those small crusty things you develop after sleeping sometimes. I don&#x27;t usually get those, so I feel like it&#x27;s the product that encourages that. But maybe that&#x27;s a sign that it&#x27;s working?</li>
    <li> I love this, works great!</li>
    <li> I tried this eye serum for a few weeks as I wanted to be perfectly sure it was working!  AND IT DID!!!  I used other products which didn&#x27;t help much but the ATAL eye serum definitely took away my puffiness and dark circles.  I thought I was seeing things but I wasn&#x27;t.  It made such difference.  I use it every morning and every night and keep looking in the mirror to be sure.  I am thrilled as the puffiness always bothered me so much and when I use the under eye cover I swear I look younger!!  This is on my permanent list and will ALWAYS have it on hand for sure.....  I&#x27;m 68 y.o. and my face looks great!!  Buy it!!!!!</li>
    <li> During these colder winter days, this serum really makes the area around my eyes feel more sumptuous, and I am 65!</li>
    <li> This eye serum is an excellent texture and absorbs into my skin nicely. Not greasy, sticky or shiny. It really reduces the under eye puffiness I have in the morning that always me looks overly tired. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on the undereye circles or wrinkle reducing effectiveness, but I have heard great things and intend to continue using this in my daily routine. The packaging is high quality and the pump delivers just the right amount of serum. No wasting!</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be a bit dry and I am prone to having dark circles under my eyes and need something special to assist me protect this sensitive area.my skin is very sensitive and easily irritated, this product did tingle my skin for like 30 seconds but quickly stopped. I have found the non sticky, non greasy but velvety texture perfect for me. I can already feel a difference to my skin and there is a definite lightening of the lines under my eyes. This Eye Serum is very easy to apply and it is non-scented. I am loving the new product.</li>
    <li> Skin around my eyes truly feel velvety smooth</li>
    <li> The Atal eye serum is great! It goes on smooth and has a neutral scent. Other serums that I have tried had a bad scent. After using the serum for just a few days, I noticed a difference in the wrinkles around my eyes. They seemed less noticeable. Also, I had a scaly patch on my face and after using this serum, it is barely there. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
    <li> I love this! I put in on every night. I helped so much with the little lines. Feels great, smells like nothing, and really works.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of ATAL products but had not tried the eye cream yet.  So, when a promotional opportunity, to get the product at a lower price came my way, I jumped on it!  And, I rely on honest reviews when I shop so promo price or not, my review is an honest account ofo my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other ATAL products and was attracted to them because of the quality ingredients (peptides a must!) and the eye cream didn&#x27;t let me down in that department.  Among the active ingredients is an ingredient I have not heard of, or tried yet, called Eyeliss.  Eyeliss is a patented ingredient that is a combination of 3 ingredients. One is Hesperidin which comes from the citrus fruit and strengthens capillaries under the eyes, helping to prevent them from leaking, thus reducing under eye puffiness.  Also, Dipeptide which improves lymphatic drainage, further reducing dark circles and under eye puffiness.  Lipopeptide is another component which improves skin’s elasticity and firmness, removing fine lines and wrinkles and decreasing inflammation.  So far, so good ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this product has all the good &amp; effective high-end ingredients that the super expensive department store brands.  It looks high end, works high end, at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:  The Velvet Eye Serum came at a good time as I had been out of eye cream and couldn&#x27;t WAIT to test it!  After 1 week of using it both morning and night, I definitely noticed a smoother appearance under my eyes and though I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; yet, when I don&#x27;t sleep well, my eyes are definitely puffy, and I noticed that when I used this serum the puffiness went away faster than if I didn&#x27;t use any eye cream.  It goes on smooth and is very refreshing to my poor, over-worked yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still need more time and will update my review after the bottle is gone.  I am fascinated by this Eyeliss ingredient and want to see it work some more magic on my eyes.  I read that a product needs to have at least 3% for it to be effective.  I am going to ask the Atal company that question and add that info when I update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said before, ATAL is a very good brand that I have been using for some time now and my skin looks excellent for a 51-year old!  I&#x27;m a fan.to have at least 3% for it to be effective.

    <li> This eye serum by ATAL is one of my favorites that I have tried.  I decided to try it out because the reviews said that it was lightweight and still moisturizing, and it&#x27;s absolutely true!  It doesn&#x27;t take a lot because it spreads well and is incredibly light without being greasy.  I can even use this in the morning and apply foundation after it dries because, unlike many eye serums that I have tried, it doesn&#x27;t start clumping or peeling after drying.  I find that it has the consistency of a nice facial moisturizer that you can apply under make up.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and feel that there is a difference.  I normally have puffy, dark circles under my eyes and those do not seem as noticeable.  Also, I find that the lines around my eyes are not as bad when I smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product because I feel that it&#x27;s working and I really like that it&#x27;s not heavy feeling at all - and the price is a lot better than many creams that I have tried and found to be too thick or too greasy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It does make the skin around my eyes really smooth and does smell good but I do not see any changes in the dark circles under my eyes,  So far I haven&#x27;t found any products that actually helps so it just might be me, or that my circles are just stuck there. It does make my eyes look more awake and less puffy though.The bottle is great, I love the pump, keeps it sanitary. I use this both morning and night. it is very creamy but not over thick. this does dry quick so you can out make up over it in just a few minutes. There is no un pleasant or chemical smell either which is a plus</li>
    <li> It was okay. Nothing spectacular.</li>
    <li> Im seeing changes in my dark circles</li>
    <li> Another amazing product by Atal, I love the face serum and was so excited by the release of an eye serum too. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles yet but I am conscious that my skin is showing the early signs of aging and I need to start investing in it. The eye serum feels amazing, it absorbs well and isn&#x27;t heavy, perfect! By far the best eye product I have tried. Thanks Atal!</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Ultimate Age Defying Serum from Atal a few months ago.  In the weeks since. I see a big difference when I look in the mirror. Many smaller wrinkles have disappeared completely and the lines around my mouth are not as deep and noticeable. When I saw the Velvet Eye Serum, I simply had to try it.  Their serums are light and do not interfere with makeup. The eye serum really does feel velvety and light. Just two drops in the AM and PM.  I can already feel the tightening under my eyes and the dark circles are much lighter, after one week of use.  I have always been very sensitive around my eye area.  There are so many products that I cannot use under my brow bone or it burns and I can&#x27;t use it. So it was with trepedition that I put it under my brow and there was no burning.  I can use it all over the eye area and it only takes a couple of drops each time so I think this bottle will last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> Bought during a promotional period.  I have sensitive skin and was a little skeptical on trying a &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34; serum. I have I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a week now! I can&#x27;t believe the results I am seeing already. I&#x27;ve had no issues with my sensitivity.  I can see a difference in the puffiness under my eyes and wrinkles around my eyes!! I love the creaminess of serum and how non greasy it is like other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. My skin has even started looking radiant, smoother, and tighter. Great product!!</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received a discount code to add this eye serum to my beauty regime. The serum works wonderfully on my fine lines around my eyes, dark circles, and puffiness. The bottle is easy to pump from, no mess or clogging. It&#x27;s been wonderful!</li>
    <li> I started using the Atal Premium Eye Serum a little over a week ago, and I can already see a difference in the appearance of my skin around my eyes. While I don&#x27;t have any fine lines or wrinkles (yet), I do deal with some dark circles under my eyes and am prone to puffiness if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep (toddler mom life). The darkness under my eyes is visibly lighter. It used to look almost purplish under my eyes towards the corners, and now my skin tone appears more even (still slightly darker, but this change occurred after only a little more than a week!). I am not dealing with the puffiness anymore, either, which is amazing! It&#x27;s so nice to look well rested, even if I&#x27;m not. And I think that it is a great value for the price. With each use, I honestly use only maybe half a pea-sized amount, and I have enough to use on both eyes. The serum is very silky, and glides on easily. I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eye serum for just a few days, but I feel comfortable leaving a positive comment just from what I&#x27;ve seen so far. Though the product is more like a lotion than a serum, but I like that because it&#x27;s not greasy like some serums. The pump dispenses just enough product, and the unscented smell was a really nice thing to see. I was  The best part? It doesn&#x27;t even irritate my VERY sensitive eyes. (Not one tear.)  It does a good job re-hydrating my skin, and though I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference in the mirror yet, I absolutely feel the difference when I touch my skin. It also give a little &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; when applied, which always makes me feel like something&#x27;s going on!  I look forward to seeing how my skin reacts with more time, but so fa,r so good!</li>
    <li> I really REALLY love this serum. I love that its fresh feeling and non-greasy or oily. Its awesome for your morning routine I put this on first and then follow-up with the rest. It has a nice naturally refreshing odor and feels a bit cooling and tightening. I have problems with dark circles and sometimes puffiness. Its nice to have something that can lessen this. I would put this on under my eyelid primer.&lt;br /&gt;This arrived in just a few days. I had no issues with the seller whatsoever. Im very pleased with this transaction.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: As a frugal shopper that I am, I used a coupon code for this item in order to purchase and review this product. I use coupon codes  and shop on discount site regardless  and I normally leave reviews on the other sites as well.&lt;br /&gt; I have no connection to this seller and I shop for items I use in my home or give as gifts. My review is my honest opinion and experience with this item.</li>
    <li> This product has helped reduce the puffiness around my eyes that I&#x27;ve dealt with for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several products, but I&#x27;ve seen the best results with Atal</li>
    <li> My eye serum arrived as scheduled and it was in new condition. I have only been using it for about 5 days but my puffiness under one eye seems to have diminished a little. I have been told that the full benefits of the serum will be more apparent after about 30 days. I felt a slight tingling effect after first using it but that was just the sensation of the ingredients going to work. The serum is very easy to apply. Customer service is great!</li>
    <li> This is the first &amp;#34;beauty product&amp;#34; other than makeup I&#x27;ve ever ordered. I&#x27;m getting older and saw a chance to get this for a promotional price so I figured i would give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did!! I&#x27;m really impressed by this product. It&#x27;s so soft and silky to touch and absorbs into the skin quickly. It did have a tingle which I&#x27;m sure is perfectly normal for this type of product.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a big change in my dark circles and crows feet around my eyes. My face has been much brighter since using this product. I&#x27;ve used it on makeup days and also non-makeup days. It&#x27;s great for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for the newly aging woman :)</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t working as I hoped it would.  I still have puffiness and dark circles.  It&#x27;s just like any other product that make &#x27;miracle&#x27; claims.  It doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
    <li> Been using it for a week.  Feels nice and goes on smooth.  Havent noticed a difference yet in my crows feet but it hasnt been that long.  Like it though !</li>
    <li> This serum has done wonders for my eyes. I&#x27;ve had a really bad case of dark circles and fluid buildup under my eyes and this is making that go away. I&#x27;ve tried countless other products that just make my eyes worse not so with this product. It has been working on the crows feet too. I am very happy with this serum and recommend it to anyone who is having problems with their eye area.</li>
    <li> After purchasing  this on a promotion, I am very happy to report I love it! It really helps that crepiness around the eyes. It feels, and smells great. The moisture lasts all day. In a pinch I had to use it as an all over moisturizer once. all though I don&#x27;t recommend wasting it in this way, It worked! I also bought this same brand in the serum. I like it as well. it helps keep my face very moisturized all day long. It is packaged well also. It is a little different then other serums that I have used. It is more of a cream texture, then oilyish.</li>
    <li> I have been in the market for an eye cream/serum for a few months now. I was offered to try this one as part of a promotion. I am so thankful for that!! This is exactly what I have been looking for. This serum is extremely silky, which feels fantastic when I put it on my eyes. I have lots of little fine lines around my eyes. In the week and a half that I have been using this product I am noticing that my lines are getting finer. I am so excited to keep using this product to see if they will continue to disappear!! Also, you don&#x27;t have to use hardly any to get the job done. A half squirt covers both of my eyes generously. This bottle should last me quite a while!!!</li>
    <li> I received my delivery of Atal Premium Eye Serum a little over two weeks ago and I was first impressed with how quickly it absorbed into the delicate skin around my eyes. I have puffiness under my eyes, especially in the morning, and noticed a reduction within a few days. I was extremely happy! I use a very small amount, just a drop for each eye, and I can already see a difference in the appearance of the fine lines at the outer edges of my eyes. The fine lines are less noticeable and the skin appears thicker and more resilient. I purchased this product at a reduced rate but will happily repurchase this eye serum at full cost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not moisturizing, I thought it would at least hydrate. Still have dark circles and wrinkles. This does not work wonders on everyone because everybody is different.</li>
    <li> The skin around my eyes is very sensitive, so I&#x27;m always a little nervous to try eye serums or creams. When I was asked to review this product as part of a promotion, I decided to give it a try, as I do have puffiness beneath my eyes. I immediately noticed the pleasant smell and the smooth texture. I experienced no irritation and began seeing results within days!  My eyes are less puffy, requiring less make-up, so it&#x27;s a win-win!  I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin looking to decrease under eye puffiness.</li>
    <li> After trying other Atal products I was quite excited to try the eye cream as well.  I purchased this with a coupon &amp; I have been using this for over 2 weeks.  Like other Atal products it doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering smell.  It smells great &amp; glides onto the delicate eye skin smoothly.  I have very sensitive eyes &amp; the skin around my eyelids is also very sensitive &amp; prone to redness &amp; pealing.  I have had no problems with redness or pealing &amp; I can honestly say my dark circles have lightened since using this product!  I&#x27;m amazed &amp; very pleased!</li>
    <li> Lets start at the top. The packaging is amazing. It comes in a beautiful box suitable for gifting.  But you&#x27;ll want to keep it. It comes sealed even though it doesn&#x27;t have to be by law. The pump works like it should and the cap stays on. As an experienced product tester, these are the little things that I haven&#x27;t seen in other products that really matter to me. Yes, I received it at a promotional price to test, evaluate and review as a consumer and I&#x27;m here to tell you that I&#x27;m more than a fan of the ATAL line because it&#x27;s evident in everything they&#x27;ve done from the research to their ingredients to their packaging that they have taken everything into consideration to put forward premium products. Next week, I&#x27;ll be 52 years old and I&#x27;m aging gracefully like my mother but you can&#x27;t leave it all to mother nature. I&#x27;ve been using this eye serum twice a day along with their moisturizer. I find that others have too much water in them. This is very creamy. I find that not only are my lines diminished after 3 short weeks but my eye lids are firmer and my under eye more supple and youthful looking. I understand why they call it Velvet Eye Serum. It may sound corny but my eyes do feel as smooth as velvet. This is one of several grand products in the ATAL Line.</li>
    <li> I have never tried an eye serum before, so when I saw this as a promotion I decided to try it. In my unbiased opinion the premium eye serum is very velvety feeling and goes on smooth. It makes my skin around my eyes feel so soft. I like that it is not scented. I have never had dark circles under my eyes, I wanted to try this for reducing puffiness and it seems to be working very well.</li>
    <li> 9/30/2015 As you&#x27;ll see in the comments, Atal said they&#x27;d refund me the amount. They never followed up or responded.&lt;br /&gt;Save you money and look for a different solution. This does not work.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye serum a couple of weeks ago at a discounted in exchange for my honest review.  I am always on the lookout for quality products that don’t cost an arm and a leg.  Even though I purchased this at a discount, I will definitely purchase this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The claims –&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reduces puffiness and ark circles – I noticed a marked reduction in the puffiness and dark circles around my eyes.  I have been plagued with dark circles all my life.  During allergy season, I look like I have 2 black eyes.  Concealer can only do so much.  After about a week of using the eye serum, I noticed that my concealer was actually working to even out the darkness under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reducing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines – I didn’t notice this as much in the mirror, but I did after taking the after picture.  I can see the lines are less prominent.  I can only guess that this will continue as use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydrating and plumping the delicate skin – The serum feels very silky and a little tingly when you apply it under your eyes. I do feel that it is hydrating.  I’m not sure about the plumping part as I feel like it is reducing the puffiness more than plumping it.  Although, I do see the fine lines diminishing so, maybe it is doing both.  It has only been 2 weeks.  I think this will be revealed more the longer I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes your eyes look more radiant and youthful – I feel it does, yes.  I took a picture the day before I started using the serum and then I took another after using it for 2 weeks.  I can definitely tell a difference and I am pleased with the results that I am seeing.</li>
    <li> This eye serum has made a huge difference in my eyes with puffy and swollen eyes, even better for the dark circles, it has also reduced  the small wrinkle lines around my eyes and crow feet that I have been developing  now that I am over 40.  I use this every morning and evening, and I feel the difference in the first response of using the product.  I strongly recommend the product, but use only under the eye, I did rub some on the eye lids why adding my daily moisturizer and received some drying of the skin.  But if you have struggle with puffy and dark rings it&#x27;s a fabulous product!!.</li>
    <li> The velvet eye serum is velvety! It goes on so smoothly and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive skin. I also like that&#x27;s it&#x27;s oil free and non-greasy, making it easy to wear under my makeup all day. I use the face serum too, so now have &#x27;the set&#x27; for my skin. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Have been using the eye serum for just over 2 weeks and am happy with the results so far. First application my skin quickly absorbed the serum, my undereye area seems plumper, fine lines minimised and skin tone seems brighter. Consistency is light and keeps my eye area ‘refreshed’ looking through the day. A little goes a long way, so far I have not needed to use additional eye cream, will wait for the colder, dryer winter to kick in and see if a booster is needed.&lt;br /&gt;A fair price for a product that has had some pretty quick/ visible benefits for me – thank you Atal </li>
    <li> I received the Premium Eye Serum.  I ordered it before I was done with my other product so I have only been able to use it a couple of times, but I can tell you it is very nice.  No smell, goes on smooth and is not sticky, can&#x27;t wait to use it exclusively to see what the final results will be.</li>
    <li> Immediate result. Not kidding. I&#x27;m very sensitive in under eye area. I&#x27;ve tried so many serums, creams... This actually works. No stinging to eyes! I&#x27;ve been using for about 2 weeks, very happy so far. My under eye area gets very dry with most products I&#x27;ve used, leaving me even more frustrated and sad. This has been nice. Cream has nice texture. No fragrance!! I will absolutely purchase again. I may even try another product from this company, which is equally impressive so far - in terms of delivery, packaging, and concern for how their consumers like their product. Could this be a product that actually delivers what they claim?  I know, I know- different skin types, so not all products screaming that they will work actually will! I get it. Well, for this consumer- 46, who requires no fragrance, sensitive skin, suddenly plagued with puffy eyes (ugh)...this product is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this serum, it&#x27;s creamy and concentrated and I noticed a subtle, smoother outer eye area pretty quickly. I use it in combo with the facial serum twice daily, and with all the peptides in the formulas, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> good product, recommended!</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Advantage Eye Serum! It feels silky smooth as I apply it, and it has no fragrance. So it doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes when applied. It is lightweight and feels great. I personally like putting my serum in the refrigerator to keep it cool to add an extra cooling effect when applying to my tired eyes.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I use it twice daily as recommended, and each time I immediately feel a warm tingling effect around my eyes as it quickly gets absorbed and begins to rejuvenate the skin. Would definitely recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply - a little goes a long way.  You can see the difference how it refreshes your face after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of the Atal Anti-Aging Serum for a while now, so I was very excited to be able to try their Eye Serum during a promotional period. The product is beautifully packaged and looks like something you would find at a high end beauty store. The serum has a light, neutral scent. It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly into the skin. The pump is easy to control with the amount of pressure you apply, so you can limit the amount of product you dispense since it doesn&#x27;t take very much for each use. My eyes are very sensitive to skin care products and cosmetics. In recent years, my eyes will often water a lot &amp; then when I rub them, any products that I have been using sometimes gets into my eyes. It&#x27;s only a big deal if the product causes my eyes to sting. The Atal Eye Serum does not sting my eyes at all! I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks. I don&#x27;t usually have puffiness or dark circles around my eyes, but I do have plenty of fine lines. Since using this serum, I am beginning to notice the diminishing of those fine lines. I will update my review later if necessary.</li>
    <li> Look no further for your daily eye cream.  I absolutely love this product.  With just a small amount and you can apply this to both your eyes.  A little goes a long way.  It has a wonderful (not heavy) scent.  I don&#x27;t like heavy scented lotions on my face.  The eye cream is non greasy and will absorb underneath your eyes in no time.  I applied this in the morning and at night.  I&#x27;ve never really used eye cream before, but I will be adding this to my must haves.</li>
    <li> I am up late these days taking college classes after work. Needless to say I am overtired after late nights with the books and on the computer. My eyes have suffered until I received this eye serum as a promotion. I have used it for about a week, and i can already see that it is helping my dark circles and puffiness I&#x27;ve been noticing. It provides a nice smooth texture to the under eye area which is really nice feeling.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eye Serum that I have ever used.  I have tried so many different products over the years and this one works perfectly for me. I have just ordered two more tubes.  I don&#x27;t want to run out!  Thank you so much ATAL.</li>
    <li> Went to bed a skeptic woke-up a believer!  I have very sensitive eyes and was worried to try yet another eye serum.... but I am very happy with this product and will be recommending this to friends and family with sensitive eyes as well!</li>
    <li> I am one skeptical of all the different eye creams out there but I decided to give this one a try! Not only does it feel good on but it help unload my face of the luggage beneath my eyes that has been sitting there for the last 10 months! My face already looks refreshed within 2 days of using it!</li>
    <li> Love this eye serum!  IT goes on so smoothly and I really feel like it may be helping already.  I like the pump, it gives the perfect amount.  I don&#x27;t find this to be greasy at all, dries quickly without residue.</li>
    <li> I have been using this premium eye product for about two weeks and there is such a difference. I don&#x27;t have tired eyes anymore. They look bright and rested. This product isn&#x27;t oily, it&#x27;s creamy like lotion. I recommend  this product to everyone, even the woman on the go.</li>
    <li> This eye serum is very luxurious.  It feels so smooth as you put it on.  There is a small warming feeling that I love because it feels like it eliminates the puffiness in the morning.  It smells very fresh and nice. The bottle has a lid that snaps on pretty tight, but I wish that the pump would also lock in case the lid goes missing.  A little goes a long way and this bottle will last me months.  Well worth it.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have only had this for a few days and I can honestly already see a difference. It&#x27;s really creamy, and feels like liquid silk when you put it on. I&#x27;m so glad I decided to try it. You don&#x27;t need much at all. I look forward to putting in on every night, lol. I know it sounds crazy. I&#x27;ve even found my husband stealing some too. (Now I hide it)</li>
    <li> First and foremost, Atal Eye Serum is an amazing moisturizer.  Fines lines under the eyes disappeared immediately upon the first application as my skin absorbed the serum. As I continued to use the eye serum, I decided to also use on my upper cheek bones where I have some laugh lines and on the area around my lips where I have some vertical lines.  The thinner lines perpendicular to my lips have filled in and the few deeper lines are not so prominent.  Same for my laugh lines - the thinner ones are almost gone.  Even in my super magnification make-up mirror, the lines are not as apparent.  The eye serum worked best on the finer lines, but, since I have only been using for three weeks, I am optimistic about future improvement but actually am quite happy to see some of those lip lines disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping it would also help lighten the dark areas under my eyes but have not noticed a lightening in skin tone under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use the Atal Eye Serum in conjunction with the Atal Face Serum and the skin on my face feels softer and smoother, and the pores more refined.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. To be honest it works great for puffiness and dark circles under the eyes but does absolutely nothing for slight wrinkles/lines under the eyes.</li>
    <li> I really like the texture of this product. It is not as aggressive as some eye serums, so it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like other products. It is more creamy than liquid-like. I am happy with the results, although they were not instant. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and am happy with it so far!</li>
    <li> I am a 62 year old  road cyclist and someone raised in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s on the idea that a sun-tanned skin was a sign of good health. Consequently my skin bears the hallmarks of all these factors.  I have been using Atal Advantage Velvet Eye Serum for the past 4 to 5 weeks and am quite impressed.  A busy, out-doors type, I follow a skin-care routine with some reluctance.  I need something that is quick to apply and let&#x27;s me get on with the day.  Atal Advantage Velvet Eye Serum and the Atal Age-defying Facial Serum work so well together. Because it absorbs quickly, I&#x27;m not left with a greasy after-feeling.  As well, my eyes are inclined to turn watery / sensitive to certain out-door conditions and certain eye products.  The Atal Advantage eye serum hasn&#x27;t caused me any watery or sensitivity problems.  All round, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not bad, just not for me</li>
    <li> Love this serum.  I have sensitive skin and was hesitant, but not a single issue with this.  I love how the skin around my eyes has firmed up.  I&#x27;ve tried so many different products to help firm up the skin and reduce the dark circles.  This is certainly the product for that.  The skin around my eyes is super soft, not issues when applying make-up.  I highly recommend this serum.</li>
    <li> This  Atal Skin Solutions Eye Serum is fantastic. The number one reason I love it is because it does not irritate my very sensitive skin. Finding good products that work for me without irritating my skin is very hard, especially around the sensitive eye area. With this serum you only have to use a pea sized amount for both eyes. It smooths on very easy and then soaks in very fast without leaving any sticky or greasy residue behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this eye serum for about 5 days and I do notice a difference. The skin around my eyes is smoother and tighter. The fine lines are diminished and less noticeable. No, they aren&#x27;t magically gone forever, but they are almost invisible to the naked eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye serum is great to use under foundation also. Many times when I have used lotions or serums under foundation it looks crusty or clumpy. That is not the case with this eye serum. This serum only makes your foundation look more smooth around your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did receive this eye serum at a promotional rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, this review is based 100% on my own experience with this product.</li>
    <li> So far, so excellent!  I resisted buying any eye cream for so long because they were (or seemed to be) repackaged face cream.  I have &amp;#34;puffy&amp;#34; eyes and light dark circles, always looking tired regardless of sleep/stress control, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this under my eyes, tapped it lightly for 2-3 minutes, and woke up the next morning with virtually no darkness and reduced puffiness. The results - the &amp;#34;love (of product) at first sight (use)&amp;#34; - have been consistent. I&#x27;m not sure if the changes are long term or sustainable on an erratic schedule (my typical modus operandi). For now, since there have been quick results, I&#x27;m more likely to keep with a lazy regimen.</li>
    <li> Received the product quickly, have been using it twice a day for a month haven&#x27;t really seen any results yet</li>
    <li> I have used this product twice a day for 5 weeks, but have noticed zero difference in dark circles or wrinkles. When I asked customer service about this, the rep said: &amp;#34;if you are olive skinned and the dark circles are genetic, our serum won&#x27;t be able to help.&amp;#34; I was pretty disappointed about this. I&#x27;m 32 and didn&#x27;t have too many wrinkles to begin with and I am olive skinned, so maybe that&#x27;s why the serum didn&#x27;t make a difference for me.</li>
    <li> IT ONLY WORKS WHEN CONSISTENTLY USED DAILY!</li>
    <li> I was asked to review this item, though all opinions are my own. I have awful dark circles, even when I&#x27;m well rested, so I was excited to try this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and I see an improvement in the darkness. It&#x27;s subtle, but the dark circles are definitely lighter, and I&#x27;m by no means getting more sleep all of a sudden! (my two year old doesn&#x27;t allow that). I think after longer use, I will be able to see a dramatic improvement. The serum has barely any odor, and the little smell you can smell is not bad in my opinion. It&#x27;s a *touch* greasy, but I think you only get this result if you use more than necessary. A little really goes a long way, which is always good from a value standpoint. Overall, I really like this serum and will be working it into my daily skincare regimen.</li>
    <li> It is ok and I do notice a differnece after 3 weeks of use.</li>
    <li> I received this serum during a promotional period and I&#x27;m really impressed with it. It is light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel weighed down like some other products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve only used the product for a few days now but I&#x27;m hooked!!! I have found my new go to and I&#x27;m sticking with it!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for awhile now and love it. I have used this with the anti aging serum and they work really harmoniously together. I have sensitive skin and have had reactions in the past, but have had only positive results with the Atal range. It has helped with puffiness, fine lines and dark circles. Will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> I am always looking to try new skin care products specially eye products. When I was given the opportunity to get this product at a great discount for my hones opinion, I couldn&#x27;t resist. This eye serum from Atal is full of good ingredients that have proven record of providing healthy and radiant skin. It has Haloxyl® and Eyeliss® that improves the skin around the eyes. Apple stem cells, that has been in the news lately and known to combat signs of aging and wrinkles. Peptides to increase production of collagen. Every ingredient in this serum helps in making eyes more radiant. I prefer serum over creams, as it absorbs quickly and leaves no greasy residue. The skin is smooth and hydrated right after first application. I have been using it for some time and can definitely see an improvement. My under eye bags are less visible, skin looks taut and radiant. Eyes are more open and can see the wrinkles diminishing. With continued use I am confident to see more results.</li>
    <li> I puchased this to go with the face serum &amp; love them both. So glad i jumped on the promotional offer. This product has such a soft silky feeling, no scent, goes on smoothly &amp; feels great on my skin. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles &amp; am hoping to prevent the appearance of more with these products... So far, so good. :). I need to use for a few more weeks before reporting on the complete effectiveness of it on my under eye area as I&#x27;ve inly just been using this one for a few days. At this point, I definitely recommend based on feel, scent, etc.</li>
    <li> I loved the Atal Anti-Aging Face Serum so much and found it so effective I decided to buy the Eye Serum as well.  I haven&#x27;t been disappointed - its a wonderful product.  A small amount goes a really long way and I have seen an improvement on both my dark circles and fine lines.  So my recommendation is that you buy both and use them together.  I will definitely be back for more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an avid outdoor type. Lots of sun wear and tear. I am 50 and it is starting to show. Ive been using this for about 4 weeks and it has made a visible difference. I don&#x27;t get alot of sleep but you can no longer tell by bags under my eyes!</li>
    <li> I use the Atal Anti Aging Serum and I love it. I received a coupon for this Eye Serum so I figure I&#x27;d give it a try. I was looking for something to give more concentration on smoothing out the wrinkles around my eyes and lightening the dark purple circles. This did not disappoint! Admittedly I&#x27;m only 32 so my wrinkles weren&#x27;t horrible, but they were there and I wasn&#x27;t too happy about it. I&#x27;ve been using this less than 3 weeks and I have noticed a drastic reduction in wrinkles. Considering how much improvement the serum resulted in after such a short period of time, I&#x27;m confident that my wrinkles will be a thing of the past very soon. Even more important is the change in the circles under my eyes. I usually wear a ridiculous amount of makeup under my eyes to try and cover up the purple circles. I always have to edit out the circles in pictures because they are so bad. They are so much lighter now that I barely have to do any touch up on pictures and I am definitely wearing less makeup. I&#x27;m thinking just a few more weeks and I&#x27;ll be circle free. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I purchased this eye serum and the face serum during a promotion a couple of weeks ago and I really like them. This serum can be used alone or under an eye cream. I use it alone as I don&#x27;t have very many issues yet with aging. It has a creamy texture and almost no scent. It absorbs quickly I to my skin without really leaving a residue and I really like that. My skin feels soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> After this Serum reviews, i am losing faith in reviews.I have been using the serum religiously(2-3 times a day) for 12 days now but haven&#x27;t seen a sign of difference on my skin.Everyday, i clean my skin then apply and some times during the day when my skin feels dry then i apply again(as recommended).&lt;br /&gt;Before i bought i sent an email to ATAL , asking if your product is good for 62 years old woman.Also, asked if you have stronger serum for mature skin. Now, i know why never heard from them.</li>
    <li> Great cream.  Absorbs completely.  Takes very little.  Get more than expected.  Expected a small bottle, not.  Well worth the $$ paid &amp; will order again.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Everything was intact  and delivered as promised. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> I am 51,with oily - sensitive skin.  Most products containing any type of oil will break me out or burn my eyes once the product migrates.  I have only been using this serum for about two weeks and have not seen the full results yet however I am pleased with the product so far.  The lines around my eyes have diminished some and there is less sagging.  I do still have dark circles but this may be hereditary for me and there is no miracle cure for them.  I am the most pleased about the fact that this serum moisturizes my eye area without irritation my sensitive eyes.  I will likely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and have not seen much difference in the dark circles under my eyes.  That being said you are supposed to give the product a little more time to work than 2 weeks.  I do notice that the skin this is applied to feels great..softer for sure.</li>
    <li> Have only used this for a few days, but so far I really like it! The product is a nice texture, and no scent, which I enjoy. It goes on smoothly, and dried quickly. I was able to put make up on over it within a few minutes. You feel a slight tingling which subsides quickly. I definitely saw reduced puffiness/increased tightness under my eyes immediately. I can&#x27;t report back on wrinkle reduction or dark circles, but will do so after a longer period of use. I am interested to try other products by this manufacturer!</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I use it every am.  Instantly I see feel a tightening of the skin when I put it on.  I have small children and always feel like I have noticeable bags under my eyes from lack of sleep.  This product is a keeper as the price is inexpensive for the results I am seeing.</li>
    <li> These products have surpassed what I thought they would.  The price is good for an above average cream.  I do think I see some improvement of texture and lines.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> This is a luxurious serum. I have been using it for a little over 2 weeks and I am seeing results! The dark circles I have tried many things to reverse are finally improving! Even my husband commented on my glow :) I am using this in conjunction with the anti aging face serum and I totally recommend that too. The combo is awesome! I am picky about what I put on my skin, I have to be because I have sensitive skin. This product glides on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed! I am so glad I came across this sale.</li>
    <li> I recently had a sweet baby girl and have not been getting as much sleep which leads to dark circles under my eyes. I saw this eye serum up for a promotional price and decided to try it. I am glad I did. I have used it for a little while now and I am already noticing the darkness receding under my eyes. I just look so much more bright eyed and healthier in the face, I am very pleased!</li>
    <li> I Have Seen This Work Right in My Own Home&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this eye gel because I watched my son use it for a month and saw for myself – it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients in this eye gel are the ingredients I would choose if I were making an eye gel – hyaluronic acid, plant stem cells, licorice root – ingredients that really help your skin look its best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now be aware, this product does not work overnight.  It took about a month for the puffiness to disappear from my son’s eyes, so I’m expecting it to take a month for mine to disappear as well, but seeing the results he received with diligent use, I have to say I’m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m just getting started, but I’m looking forward to the puffy eye syndrome vanishing from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE STARS!</li>
