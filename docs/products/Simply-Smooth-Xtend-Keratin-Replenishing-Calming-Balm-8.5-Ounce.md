<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this along with SS shampoo and conditioner because of my keratin treatment.  Love the products</li>
    <li> This product is part of the Keratin Treatment that you use to maintain your hair. I found it to be to much it leaves my hair to soft and with no body. I would skip it if I knew. My hair is fine and thin so I think this is to much. I gave it to my daughter her hair is thick and it works well for her.</li>
    <li> The package arrived ok, but the wrapping made the entire container sticky.  Fortunately, I still had my almost empty bottle, so I could pour all of the contents into the non-sticky container.  Also, I have been using this product for a while now and this was the first time it was watery versus creamy.  What happened???</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great.</li>
    <li> I have colored, thick, naturally curly hair which I am trying to grow out. Use only about half a pump, work in wet hair and dry immediately.  My curls are calmed and drying time is cut in HALF.  Then only need the flat iron for touch up.  I bought this in June, use it daily and still have about 1/2 bottle left!</li>
    <li> I use simply smooth shampoo and conditioner. I learned of this product from my hair stylist. This product left my hair silky and shiny! I have chemically relaxed hair and a keratin treatment.</li>
    <li> Keritan Smooth is awesome.  The order and delivery went smoothly (no pun intended).  I have VERY curly hair and it definitely takes the frizz out.  Not a lot of the product is needed, which means it will last a lot longer.</li>
    <li> It works better than most products I have tried to add smoothness and style to thick hair. Still would have liked it to work better.</li>
    <li> Works well on my curly hair -cuts the frizz down, even when it is quite humid outside.  Great product, reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> I really like this balm, it smells nice and makes my hair feel soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for protecting your hair from blow drying and/or straightening irons.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product and have had great results.  Really helps my hair and cannot live without it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 2 years. I have naturally curly hair and live in a very humid climate. This calming balm really helps keep the frizz down.</li>
    <li> I use this product during the summer when the humidity can turn my hair into a big frizz ball. It keeps it smooth for most of the day.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product about a week ago, I went to my stylist for a routine trim and she put this product through my hair while it was still wet.  It is a great product if you blow dry your hair out every day. It smells great ( mix between vanilla, honey, shea).  I use about a half dollar size amount and I have normal to dryish hair, medium length. Its non greasy and leaves your hair smelling and looking great.  If you plan on buying, purchase from &amp;#34;The Shampoo Guy&amp;#34; on Amazon, my package came with a complimentary gift from the seller (very impressed) and it was well packaged, the product came in perfect condition!!!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I have curly hair and this product (along with Keratin Treatment) works so well! I barely need to use my flat iron!! One pass and I am done. I use to spend over an hour straightening my hair...now I take maybe 20 minutes. So worth the price! Buy on Amazon since your salon will charge $30. I love amazon and you will love this product!!</li>
    <li> Not really to big on the calming balm, have not seen much progress from it, don&#x27;t use it often cause it makes the hair flake.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It is the only product I&#x27;ve found with curly, kinky and frizzy hair that blocks moisture and humidity after you flat iron or straighten your hair.  I don&#x27;t have the keratin treatment on my hair but someone at a beauty school turned me onto this product and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.  You must apply the balm to wet and damp hair, then blow dry, then flat iron.  I had great RESULTS!!</li>
    <li> I looked around for a good hair care line with parabeen and sulfate free and like what this line had top offer.  The price on the company was very high and I ordered it from here which offered a relatively good price. I received the shipment very fast and started using it right away and it did NOTHING like it described. I called American culture/Simply Smooth company only to find out that they only sell to hair salons and online through them. I hope I am wrong or was given the incorrect information but according to them their items are ONLY sold online through them.</li>
    <li> Non greasy, and very natural . Very pleased with this product, better than any calming product I&#x27;ve ever used. Great.</li>
    <li> After much searching and reading positive reviews on this product, I decided to give it a try. Overall ...the product smells very yummy and the texture of this product slides right into your hair (very slippery, and one pump goes a long way). I have used this product 3 ways,(1) after washing hair, put in product, letting  hair air dry. Results:  soft but had fly aways . (2) after washing hair, put in product, blow dried hair using a defuser, leaving it naturally wavy. Results: hair felt dirty.  (3) after washing hair, used product, blow dried and straightened .. wrong thing to do !  Hair felt dirty, and lifeless, not soft and shiny as I had read from other reviews.  I only used one pump as this stuff is very thin in texture and goes a very long way! So instead of letting it sit in my basket of hair &#x27;misfits&#x27; .. I use it as an overnight conditioner which I think works nicely, however to get the greasy feeling out of my hair the next day,  I have to shampoo twice !!!!  Wont purchase again :(</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel amazing even after all the heat damage I put it through of blow drying and styling</li>
    <li> Lives up to its expectations.  Keeps hair frizz-free and extends the life of Keratin treatments.  I must have for anyone who has had a Keratin treatment done on their hair.</li>
    <li> It has a good smell, it&#x27;s light and it helps control the frizzes.</li>
