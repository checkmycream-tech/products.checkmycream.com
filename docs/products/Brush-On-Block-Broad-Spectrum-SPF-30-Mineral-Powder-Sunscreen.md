### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great to keep in my purse for an in the go mom!</li>
      <li>This powder feels like nothing at all - and works awesomely!</li>
      <li>then it would be awesome!</li>
      <li>Brush on Block is a great alternative!</li>
      <li>product form is great - I think everyone should have one in their car or handbag, always!</li>
      <li>But for applying sunscreen on the go with the added benefit of decreasing or eliminating shine - I am totally happy with this!  </li>
      <li>Purchased for scalp (thinning hair) and works wonderfully, now I use all over.</li>
      <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m so pleased that I am no longer bound to sunscreen by lotion or spray!!!</li>
      <li>If you are a powder person this is good!</li>
      <li>It goes on beautifully and does not cause any breakouts.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great idea</li>
      <li>Great product - NOT untinted.</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my dermatologist as a great way to cover up .</li>
      <li>My shoulders and arms were great after 2 applications -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy I did.  </li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>Love this product!!</li>
      <li>Good coverage and no greasy feeling.  </li>
      <li>Easy application and myself and kids!!</li>
      <li>Love the convenience of this powder!  </li>
      <li>I love not feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; after applying!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to just apply to face if you don&#x27;t want any grease but men won&#x27;t use it and it isn&#x27;t great for women...</li>
      <li>Great easy to use product.</li>
      <li>Compact size, fits nicely in purse.</li>
      <li>Color is good for light skins but if you have a darker skin tone it will make your skin look ashy.  </li>
      <li>Very light - cannot feel at all.</li>
      <li>Timely order, nice, easy product to use.</li>
      <li>So Cal Sun for an hour  or more.</li>
      <li>Did safety comparison for chemicals and allergens; is MORE safe than liquid/cream sunscreens (they absorb and show up in mother&#x27;s milk, mineral powders don&#x27;t).</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Once it gets going you shouldn&#x27;t have any more issues.</li>
      <li>I love the idea of this product</li>
      <li>Easy to use and a great alternative to creams which can get very sticky.</li>
      <li>It works well and is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>The Brush On Broad Spectrum SPF Mineral Sunscreen is really great.</li>
      <li>Product is light, neutral color (like face powder) and may show in darker hair.</li>
      <li>So far so good.</li>
      <li>So easy to apply - especially on little ones - and works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>I also have one for my 9 year old daughter as it more fun to apply that lotion!</li>
      <li>I really like this product as it is non greasy and easy to use.</li>
      <li>So far is ok,</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and, if applied corrrectly, does help on my face, which is normally under a hat.  </li>
      <li>This is also easy to use and transports nearly in your purse.</li>
      <li>Only drawback is that it is not waterproof, but most sunscreens will recommend reapplication after swimming.</li>
      <li>Wish it came in higher SPF</li>
      <li>I feel like I&#x27;m wasting product trying to make sure my face is properly covered</li>
      <li>so my skin is already super sensitive as it is</li>
      <li>Solid product and huge $$ savings vs the standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>delivery was fast and product looks really neat.</li>
      <li>Very pretty packaging, the powder has some spark to it which is great; however, the powder barely comes out from the brush so it is frustrating.</li>
      <li>I want sure how this could work,but tried it based on other reviews.  </li>
      <li>Not messy or sticky and works well.</li>
      <li>difficult to fit the top back on the container.  </li>
      <li>Turn to left where orange band is to open, turn to right closes it.</li>
      <li>If you have dark skin or want to use it on or near you scalp/hairline then this is not the right product for you... or me.</li>
      <li>Sure it makes me look white white alone, but a little Mica  powder and blush or bronzer</li>
      <li>however it&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re getting full coverage with a powder.  </li>
      <li>There is a little color to this so definitely need to pay attention to how much and ensuring you don&#x27;t have patches on your face!</li>
      <li>Active ingredients much less likely to cause rashes for sensitive skin (check article on &amp;#34;Trouble with sunscreen chemicals&amp;#34;).</li>

<li> It is not strong enough to keep my arms from getting tan, which I don&#x27;t like, so its back to the cream stuff again.  </li>
<li> Applied lightly it is not really visible.  </li>
<li> I hike 2x a day with the dogs and do a lot of gardening, no sunburn or other impact yet</li>

<li> Unfortunately, because my face sweats so much I really should have applied as directed - every 90 minutes.</li>
<li> Some complained about problems in figuring out how to open/close; after you try it once or twice,it&#x27;s quite simple.</li>
<li> and now I can add one less cream/lotion to my face and reduce outbreaks while decreasing flare-ups of my rosacea and preventing dark spots.</li>
<li> About half of the powder went everywhere.</li>
<li> Applied heavily</li>
<li> No smell, no yucky feeling, no sunburn on my pale skinned children.</li>
<li> but I am not sure if there is powder going through the brush.</li>
<li> It has a tan tint with small sparkles in</li>
<li> The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is extremely difficult to get the brush back into the cap without damaging it.</li>
<li> /&gt;Understanding how to use it was a little difficult.</li>
<li> I wanted to use it in the part line of my hair as I always get burnt there, but this leave behind a beige/nude colour to it.</li>
<li> Is there a secret???</li>
<li> If it doesn&#x27;t match your skin tone then it looks kinda weird.</li>
<li> but unfortunately the powder is colored like make up powder.</li>
<li> Still use a base coat of a day cream with 25</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this stuff.  So easy to apply - especially on little ones - and works wonderfully.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist as a great way to cover up . It goes on beautifully and does not cause any breakouts. I also have one for my 9 year old daughter as it more fun to apply that lotion!</li>
    <li> I really like this product as it is non greasy and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is convenient to carry on the go. My only issue is that you can&#x27;t tell where you&#x27;ve put it and so you don&#x27;t know if you have proper coverage. I feel like I&#x27;m wasting product trying to make sure my face is properly covered</li>
    <li> difficult to fit the top back on the container.  Is there a secret??? The packaging needs to be changed!</li>
    <li> I want sure how this could work,but tried it based on other reviews.  I&#x27;m happy I did.  It works well and is easy to apply.  Even easier to carry along.  I love not feeling &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; after applying!</li>
    <li> Love this product!! Keep it in my purse to apply on my arms and on my kids faces and arms when we are outside in the sun. No smell, no yucky feeling, no sunburn on my pale skinned children.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great idea but unfortunately the powder is colored like make up powder. If it doesn&#x27;t match your skin tone then it looks kinda weird. It&#x27;s easy to just apply to face if you don&#x27;t want any grease but men won&#x27;t use it and it isn&#x27;t great for women... if they could make it totally colorless then it would be awesome!</li>
    <li> Compact size, fits nicely in purse. Purchased for scalp (thinning hair) and works wonderfully, now I use all over. Product is light, neutral color (like face powder) and may show in darker hair. Did not leave tint on my face. Did safety comparison for chemicals and allergens; is MORE safe than liquid/cream sunscreens (they absorb and show up in mother&#x27;s milk, mineral powders don&#x27;t). Active ingredients much less likely to cause rashes for sensitive skin (check article on &amp;#34;Trouble with sunscreen chemicals&amp;#34;). Only drawback is that it is not waterproof, but most sunscreens will recommend reapplication after swimming. I would definitely order this again! Some complained about problems in figuring out how to open/close; after you try it once or twice,it&#x27;s quite simple. Turn to left where orange band is to open, turn to right closes it.</li>
    <li> Solid product and huge $$ savings vs the standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING: The packaging began to separate and flew open when we were opening/closing it. About half of the powder went everywhere. Handle with care!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product form is great - I think everyone should have one in their car or handbag, always!</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and, if applied corrrectly, does help on my face, which is normally under a hat.  It is not strong enough to keep my arms from getting tan, which I don&#x27;t like, so its back to the cream stuff again.  Applied lightly it is not really visible.  Applied heavily it looks like you are wearing matte face powder.  Color is good for light skins but if you have a darker skin tone it will make your skin look ashy.  The one thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is extremely difficult to get the brush back into the cap without damaging it.</li>
    <li> Great product. Love it!</li>
    <li> Very pretty packaging, the powder has some spark to it which is great; however, the powder barely comes out from the brush so it is frustrating.</li>
    <li> This powder goes on under my face powder and bronzer. Sure it makes me look white white alone, but a little Mica  powder and blush or bronzer and it&#x27;s a daily thing. I hike 2x a day with the dogs and do a lot of gardening, no sunburn or other impact yet and I&#x27;m out in the So Cal Sun for an hour  or more. If you are a powder person this is good!</li>
    <li> It is not invisible. It has a nude tone to it. I wanted to use it in the part line of my hair as I always get burnt there, but this leave behind a beige/nude colour to it. If you have dark skin or want to use it on or near you scalp/hairline then this is not the right product for you... or me.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and a great alternative to creams which can get very sticky. It arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> So far is ok, I just started using it but I am not sure if there is powder going through the brush. there is no way to know until the brush is saturaded and makes it the other way. delivery was fast and product looks really neat.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like lotion and often don&#x27;t wear sunscreen because of it. Brush on Block is a great alternative! I used it at an all-day swim meet on my face, shoulders, and arms. My shoulders and arms were great after 2 applications - no burn at all! Unfortunately, because my face sweats so much I really should have applied as directed - every 90 minutes. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m so pleased that I am no longer bound to sunscreen by lotion or spray!!! This powder feels like nothing at all - and works awesomely!</li>
    <li> Great product - NOT untinted. There is a little color to this so definitely need to pay attention to how much and ensuring you don&#x27;t have patches on your face! But for applying sunscreen on the go with the added benefit of decreasing or eliminating shine - I am totally happy with this!  Still use a base coat of a day cream with 25+ SPF but this is my go to for on the go when I am just out and about to reapply sunscreen per dr.&#x27;s orders! I have rosacea so my skin is already super sensitive as it is and now I can add one less cream/lotion to my face and reduce outbreaks while decreasing flare-ups of my rosacea and preventing dark spots.</li>
    <li> Great to keep in my purse for an in the go mom! Easy application and myself and kids!!</li>
    <li> Translucent powder that not only covers shine without looking cakey at all but also provides sun protection. Very light - cannot feel at all. Can be used in place of a mineral veil or finishing powder. This is also easy to use and transports nearly in your purse.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product however it&#x27;s hard to know if you&#x27;re getting full coverage with a powder.  I carry it around in my purse so I can touch up during the day, over my make-up.  That&#x27;s the bonus.</li>
    <li> The Brush On Broad Spectrum SPF Mineral Sunscreen is really great. Good coverage and no greasy feeling.  The Brush on Block sunscreen  contains the brush and mineral powder in one.  When you have used it all you can keep the brush and buy just the refill.  I would recommend the product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Great easy to use product.</li>
    <li> So far so good. (I haven&#x27;t been burned yet!) I bought this because I wanted to keep it in my car. The car gets so hot in the summer that regular sunscreen separates and goes bad immediately. It has a tan tint with small sparkles in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it at the same point in my routine as I would put powder on. Sometimes I just use it as my powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Understanding how to use it was a little difficult. At the bottom you turn it one click to &amp;#34;Open.&amp;#34; Any further and you will remove the powder cartridge. Then I just kept messing with it on my arm until the powder started coming out. Once it gets going you shouldn&#x27;t have any more issues.</li>
    <li> Love the convenience of this powder!  Not messy or sticky and works well. Wish it came in higher SPF</li>
    <li> Timely order, nice, easy product to use.</li>
