<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was introduced to this facial cleanser at my med spa. I was glad I found it for a cheaper price. It works, feels, smells the exact same way. Very happy with the results.</li>
    <li> Just came back to get to stock up while they are on sale. Normally, I get the regular Obagi cleansing gel but I like the C Rx better. I use it with the C Rx toner and day lotion. The first few days I noticed some redness and slight peeling but now my skin looks better than ever. I mix the day lotion with my cover up to thin it out so I get big coverage without a heavy made up look. Try the day lotion in Rx C also; it works great.</li>
    <li> Excellent for what it says. It gives good feel in the skin after using it and has great consistency.  Would buy it again. Fresh cleansing and smooth.</li>
    <li> Perfect for sensitive skin too.  A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you rinse good and use a toner like witch hazel to save money.</li>
    <li> This is a great non-harsh cleanser.  I use it with the day lotion as well.  This bottle will last for a few months, you only need to use a drop of this.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist informed me that the products I buy on AMAZON and other on line companies are probably black market or other since you can only get these physician grade products by a MD!! Great, what a waste of $. Can I get a refund?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought other items that was made by Obagi, but this C System was the best! So gentle on your skin it was amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend getting the toner http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BI08K0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_24 as well to start a good skin care regiment.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaner did brighten my skin and minimized my pores as well. It does lather well so you don&#x27;t need to use too much of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and the scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> I just finished first bottle of this wash and I love it.  Lightly scented (very feminine), very gentle and cleans well.  I use with the Clarisonic face scrubber system and have had great results.  Pricey, but you don&#x27;t need to use much so it lasts a long time.  One bottle lasted from March through July and I used twice daily.  Definitely better to buy from Amazon than doctor&#x27;s office - my first bottle was $35 and got second on here for much much less.  I have combination skin with occasional acne and this wash kept my skin very clear and made it feel softer.  Not sure if the softness is from the clarisonic though since I started using both at the same time.</li>
    <li> A gentle cleanser that really cleans and maintains youthful skin.  I was introduced to Obagi products over ten years ago in the office of a cosmetic surgeon where laser and other types of facials are available.  I&#x27;m hooked on Obagi now.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a change of my skin. May be great for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> My go to moisturizer. This product is wonderful, my skin feels smoother and any darker spots fade to nothing. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for some time now...it&#x27;s works well.</li>
    <li> Great cleaner I really like it.</li>
    <li> I ha never used Obagi before but I wish I had! This is an excellent product when used with the whole system (the toner and vitamin c serum). It brightens my face and evens my skin tone. This is by far the best brand out there and I think it&#x27;s priced competitively.</li>
    <li> Removes oil, dirt, make-up and doesn&#x27;t over-dry your face! I&#x27;ve used this line of Obagi for several years now and it is wonderful!</li>
    <li> it makes my face feel soft and smooth</li>
    <li> This cleansing gel works well with obaji RX C 5% eye serum.  This serum has vitamin C you can also use the eye serum on your face.  Try it you will be very happy.</li>
    <li> it seems like it is the real obaji cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have always loved Obagi. but it&#x27;s pricey. I know you get what you pay for. However, there are equally good products to &amp;#34;cleanse&amp;#34; your face. There are also &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products to cleanse your face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make recommendations later. (update)&lt;br /&gt;Use a good cleanser and then a better face cream/moisturizer/treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I use retinol with a vitamin C cream. I use to use the Obagi C face moisturizer but I am trying less expensive items with great ingredients now. So again future updates to come.&lt;br /&gt;Obagi is still a great product (pricey but great).</li>
    <li> I have tried so many cleansers, you wouldn&#x27;t believe!  This is, without a doubt, the best one I have ever used.  I would highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product foe 6 years. It is a great product when applied twice daily. My skin is always looks it&#x27;s best.</li>
    <li> Another great Obaji product for everyday use.  It is gentle, smells good, and has a pretty pink color.  The bottle last a while too.</li>
    <li> I have used Obaji products for 25 years.  I am a believer.  All systems are 5 stars and continuously work.  The Best!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Obagi C Rx Cleansing Gel....amazing smell and makes my skin feel so clean and fresh!</li>
    <li> I bought this cleaning gel because it was recommended by my dermatologist (along with an electronic face cleaner brush). It&#x27;s FANTASTIC! After a couple weeks, my pores were noticably smaller and my skin looked healthier. It also removes make-up really well.</li>
    <li> Love the Obagi C facial system - have been using it for 9 months now and it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I especially love that it takes off my eye make-up at night - no extra step to remove waterproof mascara!</li>
    <li> it has an awful smell and it makes my face oily.. even made my pimples worse. disappointed.will not recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I can really feel the difference in this product compared to others I&#x27;ve used. Use this in conjunction with Obagi-C Balancing Toner and 2% Salycilic acid treatment.</li>
    <li> Love my Obagi.  Would not use anything else.</li>
    <li> It is very good leave skin soft and smooth</li>
    <li> I just started using this product along with the exfoliating lotion and serum for C Rx.  This Cleanser leaves my skin feeling very clean and refreshed.</li>
    <li> It works like it should.</li>
