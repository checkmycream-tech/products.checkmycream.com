    <li> A very nice color, and hard to find lipstick.</li>
    <li> I love revlon, however I do not like this product. It is very drying and has no shine. I had to take it off because my lips became so dry. I will continue to buy revlon items, I just won&#x27;t but this lip color again. It was marked down, I guess this is the reason why.</li>
    <li> This colorstay is good through one meal and hours after but no more.  It&#x27;s not a stain but it lasts long enough.  This particular color is a nice natural lip color yet stands out enough for people to complement it.  I wear it every Sunday to church.  It is dry so you need to put on chap stick or a gloss over top if you want the shimmer.</li>
    <li> Great color for spring/summer. Goes on smooth, doesn&#x27;t clump, and lasts all day. Also Revlon is a cruelty free brand.</li>
    <li> I love the Revlon Colorstay Ultimate Liquid Lipstick very much. Unfortunatelly, I cannot find it in Argentina so I bought it through the internet. It helps me keep my lips perfect for the entire day... I am so fond of it that I even use it at night.</li>
    <li> Great product, stays all day. Find the color that&#x27;s right for you.stays on with food and drink! Highly recommended. Good value!</li>
    <li> Pretty color, but I did not like how it feels on my lips, tend to feel dry so I use with Vaseline.</li>
    <li> I am no longer able to purchase this product in my area so I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  It was the exactly what I was looking for.  It stays on for the entire day without having to reapply it.  Perfect for anyone.  I bought several colors and love them all.</li>
    <li> Happy to find these as I believe they discontinued this color.Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or chalky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lipstick for years and LOVE IT!  So sorry they are not making the color I love anymore.  It stays on all day until I take it off at bedtime.</li>
    <li> Good item ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good service !!!</li>
    <li> My wife said that she loves revlon products but this lip colour was the worst it came out wet but then it was very dry and cracked up like the colour was old.She would not recommend anyone to buy this it had her lips dry and cracked up.</li>
    <li> This product came later than expected because UPS outsources their smaller items to the post office who is notorious for losing things or items arriving late. Once the post office gets it from UPS, it&#x27;s impossible to track. It&#x27;s very misleading when your order shows it&#x27;s being shipped UPS when it&#x27;s actually the p.o. UPS has a great tracking system but the p.o. doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is orange and I don&#x27;t like it at all. Also, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t stay on. It&#x27;s called Colorstay. I use that brand all the time and this is the only lipstick that didn&#x27;t stay on. I wish I never bought it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product (Revlon ColorStay Ultimate Liquid Lipstick) from my local drugstore.  The color DOES stay on all day, but who wants their lips dried out looking like an old prune.&lt;br /&gt;Forget it.&lt;br /&gt;And unlike most long-wear lipsticks, this one comes with NO gloss, so you&#x27;re SOL.</li>
    <li> Even after I eat meal - my lipstick stays in place.  At night after I wash my face I have to use a washcloth to wipe it off.</li>
    <li> This is the product for you if you want the color to last all day without reapplying. I have a very busy work day and have no time to reapply my make up, so this product has been great for me. I was so disappointed when I found out the stores no longer carry this product, but so happy I found these on Amazon.</li>
    <li> this was a perfect color for me</li>
    <li> I love painting on lipstick, easier to control.</li>
    <li> It dries very soon and dont last for long time</li>
