      <li>Tresemme makes its own spray, so if you think these sprays are pricey, pick theirs up.</li>

      <li>It was kind of nice not being so closely tethered to the bathroom mirror and to be able to move around a bit.  </li>
      <li>It is very easy to accidentally turn the unit off.  </li>
      <li>in all, it&#x27;s a great iron and definitely worth the money.  </li>
      <li>My wife has a Chi straightener which she liked which cost considerably more.</li>
      <li>So my styling preference isn&#x27;t entirely suitable for a flatiron.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s fast heat up and beautiful job of straightening my hair.</li>
      <li>It runs about $3.00-$4.00, and makes a HUGE difference!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product and could not be happier with it.</li>
      <li>Overall I am quite impressed with the TRESemmé Philips HP4669/05 Thermal Creations 1\\&quot; Straightener.  </li>
      <li>The spot where my hand felt comfortable holding the plates together is also the spot where they chose to put the heat adjustment buttons and the on/off button!</li>
      <li>A lot of people throw around advice, and most recommend high-end hair straighteners costing from one to two hundred dollars.  </li>
      <li>and she said this one is 100 timess better.     </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>In fact, the only thing preventing me from giving this product a perfect 5 stars is the button placement on the handle.  </li>
      <li>I love this thing.</li>
      <li>All the buttons are on the top with your hand.  </li>
      <li>It also has better frizz control,esp for curly hair like mine.  </li>
      <li>I love the 1\\&quot; plates.</li>
      <li>In fact, the only thing preventing me from giving this product a perfect 5 stars is the button placement on the handle.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have any problem with hair catching on the plates, they ran smoothly over my hair, even in kinked or tangled spots.</li>
      <li>After using for one month, does not hamper my love for this iron.</li>
      <li>it did leave hair nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Place your thumb on top of the temperature readout display as you grip it.</li>
      <li>This product is way better than the cheaper ones like conair that you can get at grocery stores.</li>
      <li>it is lighter than my CHI and Corioliss irons, and to be truthful, not so sure that is a plus.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very light weight and heats up very quickly.  </li>
      <li>Although we don&#x27;t consider this to be a huge flaw, it is enough to prevent a perfect rating.  </li>

      <li>locking mechanism and storage case helped to make storage and transport easy and more manageable than the Chi.</li>
      <li>I used to like the thicker plates, thinking I could fit more hair into it, but I find the thinner plates work even better.    </li>
      <li>Sedu creates more silky and smooth hair.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line for her: quick to heat up, variable temperature control very useful, and also a handy case.</li>
      <li>Not bad for my hair!    </li>
      <li>beware as this iron is easy to accidently shut off.</li>
      <li>This allows easy maneuvering of the device without fighting with a tangling cord.  </li>

      <li>quick!  </li>
      <li>For a more reasonable price than the high-end straighteners I think I got just as good results, it was gentle and easily adjustable  </li>

      <li>The overall handle of this tool is great.</li>
      <li>temperatures shown in bright red on a LED panel like an alarm clock on the top of this iron looks really cool at first, but after initialy being impressed, you will soon just want to turn something on, and simply get hot.  </li>

      <li>This is a great little tool and the price point is even better.  </li>

    <li> My hair kept getting caught in the nano-diamond edges and pulled and it was just painful. I packed it back up and returned it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Sedu user and have been since my last Chi burned out on me in under a year. But I couldn&#x27;t resist the chance to try this new flatiron. And it does a good job! I am one of those people who takes an hour to flatiron my hair. I do it in the smallest possible sections and use about 5 products before the process starts. I like the heat spray that this iron comes with, it didn&#x27;t sizzle and pop like some of my other products (read: Frizz Ease style straight). It also doesn&#x27;t have a chemical scent that then gets burned into your hair the moment heat touches it. I like that it has a dial where you can pick your temperature, because I like my irons hot! The automatic shut-off is an added bonus, meaning you can forget it and not worry that your house will burn down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for the price, I would use this iron every day if I didn&#x27;t already have a Sedu. For now, this one will be my travel iron, since it comes with a handy dandy traveling case, and I&#x27;ll keep my Sedu at home. But if for some reason my other iron dies, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be spending another $100 to replace it when I could have this nice one that&#x27;s 2/3 the cost.</li>
    <li> it worked yes....what i liked about this was that it could be good to travel with. my teen daughter goes on a lot of sports travel overnighters and likes to straighten her hair. problem is she has very thick curly hair and this was simply not wide enough and really never got hot enough. my younger daughter loved it as she has finer straighter hair and only requires touch ups. i liked that i was light compared to other straigheners that i have used before that were big and bulky. it did leave hair nice and smooth. i would personally use a bigger straightener like a 1.5 inch</li>
    <li> Usually I straighten my hair with a hair dryer and a round brush, so I admit it took me a few tries to get used to a separate tool to do the \\&quot;straightening part\\&quot; of my morning routine. However, this little straightener gets down to business! It heats up in about 20 seconds. I started off with the lowest setting, which is 230°, and increased it from there to find the perfect temperature I needed to straighten my locks without frying them. The temperature increases in 20° increments by pressing a user-friendly + or - sign on the handle. Then it says \\&quot;READY\\&quot; when it&#x27;s at the selected temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that since hair straighteners are sort of like a heavy set of spring-loaded tongs, my thumb got tired quickly and I hit the on/off switch more than a few times. That could be something a regular user could get used to though - learning how to hold the straightener without hitting a button!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re worried about leaving a hot hair straightener on the counter while you step away for a few seconds, there&#x27;s a nice locking mechanism that allows the user to \\&quot;lock\\&quot; it closed. If you&#x27;re worried that you&#x27;ll forget to turn it off when you&#x27;re finished, it has an auto turn-off feature that kicks in after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was impressed with the speed, performance, and even appearance of this hair straightener. It even comes with a handy insulated bag to store it in as well as a small bottle of TRESemme Heat Tamer spray.</li>
    <li> This is a great little tool and the price point is even better.  I own a ceramic straightener with a price point of double what this cost.  I tried it out on my daughters hair and was very pleased.  The plates are a bit more raised and did cause some \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; to her hair but nothing devastating.  A bonus was how quickly it heated up and I loved that I could adjust the temperature so that it didn&#x27;t burn her hair.  The overall handle of this tool is great.</li>
    <li> My wife recently bought a hair straightener for over 120 dollars and she said this one is 100 timess better.     Since we got it for free you can see it was quite a gift.</li>
    <li> Wanted to give this 5 stars for it&#x27;s fast heat up and beautiful job of straightening my hair. In a few minutes I am done which is just the type of product I need. I love the 1\\&quot; plates. Thought they would be too small but actually I have found they work better. Like that it comes with storage for travel. Only problem that kept it from 5 stars is that I sometimes hit the off/temp buttons without realizing it. However, maybe just my problem. After using for one month, does not hamper my love for this iron.</li>
    <li> SIX months later:  This iron is still working like a champ.  We both use it almost daily (my daughter and I).  I&#x27;d say that it is definitely worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEST:&lt;br /&gt;*  heats up in an instant &#x3D; seriously, less than 15 seconds.  I only wish it cooled down that quickly too!  Temp  is adjustable.&lt;br /&gt;*  1\\&quot; wide blades are smooth - don&#x27;t pull hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORST:&lt;br /&gt;* if you don&#x27;t use a continuous smooth sliding motion, you end up with &#x27;ridges&#x27; in your hair.  Probably too much friction on the hair shaft... if used daily will produce frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;* I found the &#x27;low&#x27; heat setting too hot for my fine hair.  Probably ok if you have thick or really coarse wavy hair.  My daughter has thicker fuller hair and she loves it.  I always have to go to her bathroom to retrieve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one of the best features of this hair tool is that it has a clasp to close the blades when not in use.  It fits perfectly into a Vera Bradley curling iron case found here:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;so you can travel in style!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is a great tool.  My major concern is that it gives thin hair the frizzies and it took some getting used to so I didn&#x27;t end up with ridges in my straightened locks.  Hence only 4 ****&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This TRESemme Philips iron heated up extremely quick.  Had to be only seconds when I tried it and it was ready.  I noticed right away it is lighter than my CHI and Corioliss irons, and to be truthful, not so sure that is a plus.  When working behind your head, it&#x27;s nice to have more weight in the iron to help drop the iron through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even tho 1 inch wide, the length of the plates on this iron are shorter than other irons.  I think shorter plates mean less hair in the iron each time, and makes for more time to get your hair done. I dont know of anyone that loves to take lots of time straightening their hair because it is somewhat tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other irons open and close very smoothly, and sturdy at the hinge, but this iron is kinda \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; in the hinge when opening and closing this iron on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The temperatures shown in bright red on a LED panel like an alarm clock on the top of this iron looks really cool at first, but after initialy being impressed, you will soon just want to turn something on, and simply get hot.  I dont want to mess with worrying what temperatures, buttons, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever been halfway through curling your hair or straightening it, and you realize your hair isnt getting done and the iron has cooled down because shut off, beware as this iron is easy to accidently shut off. All the buttons are on the top with your hand.  Just this happening once will be enough to make you wish you tried another iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron has a brushed chrome top to it and we&#x27;ve all seen how that gets dulled and gunked up with hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This price might seem reasonable because you may be looking at CHI or other top pricey models, but CHI is no longer the only dog on the porch for a good iron and they are only riding a wave of being the early popular favorite and priced high. I think this Philips iron will do a decent job for you, and if you like a lot of bells and whistles, but it does have problems that should be considered when spending this amount of money. You can get a lot of well established salon irons in this range.

    <li> on thick wavy hair. Some flyaways, but it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice looking iron, but I do prefer a wider plate.</li>
    <li> Straight out of the box I was impressed with this iron.  I straighten my hair about 3 times a week and I have gone through several irons of many different prices over the past years.  This iron far exceeded my expectations for an iron at this price-point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the digital heat readout, much easier to control than a dial.  I also loved that it heated up in less than one minute with no weird hot places on either end or either side.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it went through my hair smoothy all the way, didn&#x27;t pull or snag.  I felt like the plates were making complete contact with my hair without having to squeeze the handles too hard.  I have used it both with and without the included Heat Tamer Spray and I got shiny smooth results every time no matter what.  I am unsure if I will buy the full size version of the spray when this sample size runs out I don&#x27;t know if it is any better than what I currently use, but it is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed with the heat resistant storage pouch.  It is a nice feature to have... seems well made.&lt;br /&gt;This iron also has a longer cord than my regular iron... It was kind of nice not being so closely tethered to the bathroom mirror and to be able to move around a bit.  Overall I like this iron.</li>
    <li> I straight off loved the size of this, thin and long which made it very easy to handle.  It&#x27;s also very light weight and heats up very quickly.  (The auto shut-off is also what I think is a must have feature even though I&#x27;ve trained myself to unplug flat/curling irons as soon as I&#x27;m done with them -- for those who don&#x27;t it does shut off in an hour, I did try this feature out.)  One issue is the placement of the control switch which happens to be almost exactly where your thumb lays so the tendency is to either shut the iron off or increase/decrease the temperature.  I pretty quickly learned to move my hand down just a bit to avoid either and was still able to full manipulate the iron.  I still didn&#x27;t find this enough of a quibble to downgrade it&#x27;s rating since the positve&#x27;s and the results far out weigh this issue.  The temperature is adjustable with a digital read-out.  It&#x27;s small enough to get right to your roots and also small enough to make it impossible to grab huge clumps of hair which defeats the purpose of flat ironing.  My hair is chemically straighten and colored and it left it smooth with virtually no frizz.  It would likely be frizz-free if I was a genius with a flat iron which I&#x27;m not, though this by far was the best and easiest I&#x27;ve ever used.  I absolutely love this product and could not be happier with it.</li>
    <li> This slim 1\\&quot; plate straightening iron really took me by surprise.  I have always used larger plates, under the impression that a 1\\&quot; plate really wasn&#x27;t going to do the job quickly enough.  This baby did the job, and well on long thick slightly wavy hair.  I also loved the versatility to be able to curl the ends of my hair with the 1\\&quot; page, serious fabulosity right there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron heats up seriously quickly.  I love the digital display and auto shut-off features as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tresemme and Amazon.  My review is after 3-4 times of use.</li>
    <li> This ia actually a good straightening iron that is not pricey. I used this as a backup to my CHI. I use this for travel and at my boyfriend&#x27;s house, since the CHI is fragile I don&#x27;t like to travel with it.    This is a great iron though. I like nano diamond plate things. It DOES make my hair smooth and shiny. It has variable heat settings, and suggested settings for certain hair types. Even though my hair is wavy, I still use the highest setting on this and it works good. I DO think it doesn&#x27;t burn your hair as much. Although, that really depends on whether or not you use a heat protecting spray.    I also like the thin shape of this iron. I used to like the thicker plates, thinking I could fit more hair into it, but I find the thinner plates work even better.    This is a good iron, bordering on great. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s great, since I&#x27;m a CHI user and a little biased. The CHI is great, but this Tresemme iron is very good also.    One last note, the iron suggests you use a heat protecting spray before straightening--and they&#x27;re correct. Not just with this iron but ANY iron.  It helps the iron to glide, and protects your hair tenfold. Tresemme makes its own spray, so if you think these sprays are pricey, pick theirs up. It runs about $3.00-$4.00, and makes a HUGE difference!</li>
    <li> When paired with the protective spray from Tresemme, this is a great little straightening iron!  It heats up super quickly and you can adjust the temperature for a custom hair style.  Within 30 seconds, the iron was heated up for my medium, hard-to-straighten hair.  I sprayed the protective spray all over my hair as directed and started straightening away.  May hair was smooth, straight, and silky within a few minutes.  Not bad for my hair!    I have used some more expensive straightening irons before at a friend&#x27;s and this one doesn&#x27;t get my hair as silky straight, but it comes pretty close and is a great price!  I agree with those that have reviewed that the temperature and on/off buttons are in the wrong spot.  I found halfway through straightening, that I had accidentally turned the hair up to the hottest temperature- definitely something to be careful of!!  However, now that I&#x27;m aware of the situation, I will be more careful.    Very nice for the money.</li>
    <li> This iron has so many good features that I hated to give it three stars, but I couldn&#x27;t find a good way to hold it without accidentally turning it off or changing the heat settings. Life is too short to jump through hoops to figure out how to hold a straightening iron. But if you have petite hands, read on for the good stuff.    This iron heats up extraordinarily quickly. I like the fact that it shows the actual temperature instead of number settings - the manual has some guidelines for what temperature to use. The lock that clamps the iron closed is a nice feature - I feel better about leaving it on the counter, or sliding it into the heat-proof pouch when it&#x27;s locked. The lock looks like plastic, so it might prove to be a little flimsy, but so far it has worked great.     The ceramic plates are very smooth, pulled through my hair easily, and did a great job. The iron is lightweight enough to easily do all my hair without stopping. It would be nice if the plates were just a little longer. The sample Heat Tamer Spray was a nice bonus. My outlets are not in a convenient spot so the long cord is definitely a plus.    If it weren&#x27;t for the poorly placed buttons, I&#x27;d highly recommend this straightener.</li>
    <li> Like most other reviewers of this TRESemme flatiron, I was amazed at how quickly it reached temperature. I didn&#x27;t have to wait at all to start using it at the default temperature of 230 F. I have thick, fine VERY curly hair which, when I straighten it, I use a round brush and blow dryer to achieve smooth ends and volume at the roots. So my styling preference isn&#x27;t entirely suitable for a flatiron. Making allowance for ineptitude, I did achieve some effective straightening, and with practice I&#x27;d probably be as successful as I am with the round brush, though I think my ends didn&#x27;t look as nice as they do when blow dried. I didn&#x27;t have any problem with hair catching on the plates, they ran smoothly over my hair, even in kinked or tangled spots. As others have said, the main negative with the iron is how easy it is to accidentally either turn it off or change the temperature setting because you tend to grip it for use it right where the buttons are. The storage case is great, it would be really nice for travel.    ADDENDUM- After several days of use, I have finally discovered the way to hold the iron in a way that avoids accidentally switching it off or changing the temperature. Place your thumb on top of the temperature readout display as you grip it. This gives you a good hold on the straightener but keeps you away from the adjustment buttons.</li>
    <li> This went to the woman of the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other straighteners are just not up to par when you compare them to this baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products seem to be very underpowered and do not get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gets hot, fast, and gets the job done in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hold great throughout the work day and the night for you party gals out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much more needs to be said but this is a great item that does its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> I am completely inexperienced with hair straightening myself, though watching my teenager straighten her hair for the past couple of years I thought I would try it and see if I got as good results as she did. We both have very wavy hair and she insisted on buying the most expensive ceramic straightener available to get the results that she wanted. Now she is away at college with her fancy straightener and I have found that this TRESemme version works just as well for my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The THERMAL CREATIONS straightener heats up almost instantly and tells you the temperature, which is conveniently and easily adjusted. It also indicates when it is ready to use in a clear digital display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight enough to comfortably run it through your hair as if brushing it and made my hair straight, but a \\&quot;natural\\&quot;straight not stick straight. It did not burn my hair, but instead left it soft and sleek. I only needed to use the lower temperature to get results, but did adjust it a bit higher for some really wavy areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it works, it is gentle and safe (since it comes with a thermal case for storage, is easy to spot when it is still on so that you remember to turn it off, and has an auto off after one hour just in case you don&#x27;t!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have ONE complaint. I think that it could have been designed just a little differently to avoid one problem. The spot where my hand felt comfortable holding the plates together is also the spot where they chose to put the heat adjustment buttons and the on/off button! So, while using it I realized that I had accidentally pressed the OFF button a couple of times AND changed the heat setting without realizing that I had pushed that button too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After adjusting where to put my hands to try to avoid this, it went fine, but it was a bit more awkward to hold either above or below the function buttons. Not a diffucult thing to get around, but you do have to watch that you have not inadvertently changed the settings to something too high or turned it off in the middle of using it. It might have gotten five stars if the design was flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: For a more reasonable price than the high-end straighteners I think I got just as good results, it was gentle and easily adjustable  and I like the safety features that I noticed my daughter&#x27;s \\&quot;fancy\\&quot; straightener did not have. Whether or not my hair stayed straight as long as my daughter&#x27;s does (she can sleep on her hair and do only touch ups the next day, where I was a bit more wavy the next morning) is another possible point to consider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would certainly recommend it.ing too high or turned it off in the middle of using it.

    <li> Not having the hair required for this (and being of the wrong sex), I gave this one to a friend to try since she&#x27;s a hair tool maniac. She decribed it after use for 2 weeks as follows: \\&quot;Fast heating, smooth results, and easy to read temp display but the buttons are in an odd area, where your hands hold the iron so that it&#x27;s easy to accidentally press a button to change the temp or turn the unit off while holding it in use.  Also, there is no area on it to hold with your second hand for assistance because the outside heats up too.  Would not recommend for a 1st time user but, it&#x27;s a good iron for the price. \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iron included a nice little storage/traveling bag to carry it in.  Compared to the other similar priced irons this wasn&#x27;t too bad.  Would probably make a nice Christmas gift or door prize for women.</li>
    <li> My wife has a Chi straightener which she liked which cost considerably more. The adjustable temperature setting she quite likes especially for her fine hair. She was able to use a 350 degree setting to get the same effect as a Chi without over-heating her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locking mechanism and storage case helped to make storage and transport easy and more manageable than the Chi. The Treseme hair product was great and a useful extra. Bottom line for her: quick to heat up, variable temperature control very useful, and also a handy case. Excellent performer.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased my first flat iron (from Amazon)--the T3 Tourmaline flat iron and I was ready to give up on the whole thing.  It was hard to tell when it was hot enough, the light blinked the whole time.  Then I had the chance to review this one.  What turned me around mainly was the quick heating time, the digital display that shows the temperature and the easy adjustment.  Also, it heats up lightening fast and displays \\&quot;ready\\&quot; when it has reached the temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still not great at handling it but this iron is much easier to handle.  I don&#x27;t do my whole head; I have a very short bob and do only my sides which tend to puff out.  I get lots of compliments when I use the iron rather than just blow-drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 (I wish I could have given 4 1/2 is that it is easy to touch the iron on the very spot where the buttons are and I constantly have to adjust the temp because I have accidentally changed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great improvement would be to move the digital display and have a coil cord rather than a straight cord.  I do like that it has a long cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a great iron and definitely worth the money.  It has a great price for a quality product.  It comes with a heat resistant bag which is great and a trial bottle of the Tresemme Thermal protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Added 11/27/2008 Still love the flat iron.  I have gotten somewhat used to the placement of the pushbutton and don&#x27;t accidentally hit it as often.  I would still like it better if it were in a different place. I gave away the one I purchased previously and am keeping this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 09/11/2011 Still using the flat iron!  Works as well as in the beginning.  I updated to 4 stars.  Still am not fond of the placement of the temperature button but am used to it now.  It&#x27;s gently on my hair which is dry and makes it look great!</li>
    <li> This product is way better than the cheaper ones like conair that you can get at grocery stores. It is very sleak design and the hair straightening effect is smoother, longer lasting and convenient.  highly recommend it. I love the digital screen.</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair straightener for my daughter.  She owned one that cost over $100.00 but left it at her old home when she came to live with us for a while.  She said she liked this one just as much.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first because really- its just a hair straightener. All it needs to do is straighten hair, right?  I love this thing. It heats up fast, and you can adjust the temp with a digital display. It tells you when it&#x27;s ready with, well, the word &#x27;ready.&#x27;  The heat-proof pouch is a nice touch, so you can store it when its still hot- no worrying about letting it cool, and it locks closed so it won&#x27;t spring open. The pouch even has a space for the cord so its not left dangling in the way of things.    I will say this, though, because the temp is measured in actual degrees rather than say, level 1-5, it&#x27;s got a bit of a learning curve, but overall I love it!</li>
    <li> What a difference ceramic makes!  The last straightener I owned was not ceramic like this one, and I can tell the difference.  This straightener heats up quickly (30 seconds!), so no more waiting for your flat iron to heat up.  It goes to work quickly and gets the job done very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can finally wear my hair stick straight!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Choosing a hair straightener can be a rather intimidating process these days.  A lot of people throw around advice, and most recommend high-end hair straighteners costing from one to two hundred dollars.  Some recommend basic ceramic plate straighteners, while others say only the Tourmaline plates should be used, since they emit negative ions, which straighten hair for longer and leave a shiny look to your hair. My oldest daughter was asking for one of these \\&quot;professional quality\\&quot; straighteners recently, even though she already owns two lower priced straighteners.  Over a hundred dollars for a couple of heated plates in a squeeze handle?  I just couldn&#x27;t see spending that kind of money, so I was delighted when I had the opportunity to receive and test the TRESemm&amp;eacute; Philips HP4669/05 Thermal Creations 1\\&quot; Straightener.  It sounded like a decent product and can be had for a reasonable price.  This model does not boast the Tourmaline plates, as my daughter&#x27;s other straighteners claim to have, but instead comes with \\&quot;Nano Diamond\\&quot; ceramic plates, which are supposed to provide smooth gliding and shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the box, I found the following items contained within:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  TRESemm&amp;eacute; -Philips Thermal Creations 1\\&quot; Hair Straightener (model HP4669/05)&lt;br /&gt;* Heat-Resistant Storage Pouch&lt;br /&gt;* TRESemm&amp;eacute; Thermal Creations Heat Tamer Spray (2.0 oz. sample size)&lt;br /&gt;* Operator&#x27;s Manual (small pamphlet)&lt;br /&gt;* Warranty and Registration Paperwork&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The operator&#x27;s manual is rather simple and easy to understand.  Of course it contains obvious warnings, which is standard for nearly any electrical device.  Some of these warnings made me chuckle, such as \\&quot;Never use while sleeping\\&quot; and also advising you not to let your eyes (or any bare skin) touch the heated surfaces of the device.  So after giving my teenage daughter a stern warning about not straightening her hair while taking a nap, and to not jam the heated portion of the straightener in her eyes (I guess Philips figures the non-heated parts of the device are safe for your eyes!), I turned the device over to her to compare against her other straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HP4669/05 Thermal Creations Straightener comes with a generous 9 foot power cord, which is attached to the handle with a handy swivel base.  This allows easy maneuvering of the device without fighting with a tangling cord.  Pressing the on/off button powers up the device, and the default 230 degree heat setting is displayed.  This is the lowest heat setting, but it can be increased up to a maximum of 425 degrees.  The temperature is displayed on the integrated backlit LCD display, and can be controlled using the + and - buttons, located on each side of the on/off button.  These buttons are quite small but easy to operate; a little too easy, as I will explain later.  The ceramic plates heat up very quickly, and the heat up time can be shortened if you leave the plates locked together when the device is powered on (usually within 30 seconds or less).  Once the device is ready for use, the word \\&quot;READY\\&quot; will appear in the LCD display, just below the selected temperature.  The device is now ready to begin straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has used this straightener on her hair, both when wet and dry, and has stated that this device is definitely not as good for straightening wet hair as her Tourmaline straighteners.  However, when used on dry hair she said that it works extremely well, and that her hair glides through the diamond-ceramic plates effortlessly.  She really likes the included TRESemm&amp;eacute; heat tamer spray, but it is such a small bottle that she used it up within the first week.  Larger bottles can be acquired from local retailers, but prices vary a great deal so you need to do some research to find decent pricing.  My daughter loves how quickly the HP4669/05 heats up, as she is usually running behind when getting ready for school in the morning.  Her hair is fairly thick and moderately wavy, and she has shown me the results after using this straightener on her hair.  Within minutes her hair comes out very straight and rather shiny.  She wanted me to remind everyone that you should never brush or comb the treated hair until it has completely cooled down, otherwise it will upset the straightening treatment before it has had a chance to set.  This is also noted in the operator&#x27;s manual as well, but it is easy to miss if you aren&#x27;t reading it carefully.  As a parent, I really like the auto-shutoff feature of this device as well, since it is not uncommon for my daughter to rush out the door, forgetting to shut the thing off.  Once powered on the straightener&#x27;s built-in timer is automatically activated, and will shut itself off after an hour if left on.  The LCD display show a series of bars, which indicate how much operating time is left before auto-shutoff occurs.  If one should want the device to operate beyond the one hour limit, you simply power cycle the device off and back on, which resets the timer.  Once you are finished using the device, and it has cooled down, you can lock the plates together with the handy lock switch located under the hinge area of the handle.  The operator&#x27;s manual also recommends that you wipe the plates and outer surface of the appliance with a damp cloth after each use.  The device can then be stored in the included travel/storage pouch if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am quite impressed with the TRESemm&amp;eacute; Philips HP4669/05 Thermal Creations 1\\&quot; Straightener.  It has a look and feel of high quality, and the results of using this product are excellent.  It is backed by a 2-year limited warranty, to protect against defects and any potential design flaws.  My daughter is extremely pleased with how quickly the device heats up, and how well it straightens her medium length wavy hair, while also producing a moderate shiny appearance to her hair as well.  Does it perform as well as a high-end, $150.00 hair straightener?  Well unless my daughter raises enough money to buy one of those herself I guess we will never know.  However, the HP4669/05 seems to perform very well and meets all of her current needs.  In fact, the only thing preventing me from giving this product a perfect 5 stars is the button placement on the handle.  While using the straightener it is too easy to accidentally change the temperature or even power the unit down entirely.  Both instances have occurred when being used, which resulted in wasted time and/or poor results.  One of my daughters other straighteners has a setting lock button, which can be used to prevent accidental button presses.  Philips should either relocate the buttons, design them to require a firmer finger press, or at least redesign the device to produce an audible beep when any button is pressed (so the user would be aware that a setting had been changed).  Although we don&#x27;t consider this to be a huge flaw, it is enough to prevent a perfect rating.  But for the price, and for normal household use, I feel this straightener is a solid 4-1/2 star product, and I would easily recommend it to anyone other than maybe a professional hair stylist.ter using this straightener on her hair.  Within minutes her hair comes out very straight and rather shiny.

    <li> ...but it isn&#x27;t as nice as my infrashine, still, and makes my hair fuzzier than my infrashine also. Using the protective spray did not seem to help one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks pretty, and stores nicely. It is easy to hold, slim, and light weight. If I weren&#x27;t already such a picky user with straightening irons I may like it a lot, so it&#x27;s probably a great gift for a teenager or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the display and how it tells me when it is ready to be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it doesn&#x27;t have the brush attachments, it&#x27;s still difficult to use to straighten the hair on the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s okay. I like it because it&#x27;s name brand (Philips) but I am not crazy over it making my hair fuzzy.</li>
    <li> My wife tries this product. Here are her comments: I have natural curly hair.  My favorite straightener is Sedu, it is much more expensive than Tresemme Philips.  You get what you pay for.  Sedu creates more silky and smooth hair.  It also has better frizz control,esp for curly hair like mine.  TRESemme has digital display, which is quite convenient.  However, it has much narrower ceramic surface than Sedu.  That may be why it is less effective. If your hair is less demanding than mine, I believe this is a decent product for you. Also the price is good compared with sedu.</li>
    <li> My wife enjoys using this flat-iron, however she still prefers her CHI.    Pros:    -Heats up quick!  -Has multiple temp settings.  -High temp available for her thick hair.  -Great price.  -Digital display tells you the temp and when it is ready.  -Storage case included.  -Long cord.    Cons:    -On/Off button placement. It is very easy to accidentally turn the unit off.  -Occasionally snags hair.  -Stiff springs will tire your hands quickly.    Overall this is a good solid product. If you can afford \\&quot;professional\\&quot; quality, do it. If you are working on a budget, this will satisfy you.</li>
    <li> Rating the TRESemme Philips HP4669/05 puts me in a quandry. On the one hand, I love the speed with which it heats up and the digital display which notifies you as to the setting in easy to read numbers. But, unfortunately, the buttons are placed in such a manner that I keep accidentally changing the settings or turning the darned thing off while styling. I took this flat iron to an out of town wedding this weekend and found that the inconvenient buttons cost me time and a great deal of frustration. In spite of changing the way I held the appliance several times, I simply could not seem to avoid  messing up the settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, perhaps this is my problem. Perhaps the way I hold the flat iron is the culprit; however, I must be honest here. For me, in spite of all the pluses, this tool will not work.</li>
