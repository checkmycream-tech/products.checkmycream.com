      <li>The return was very easy though.</li>
      <li>Feels very secure and does not feel like the bit will fall out during use.  </li>
      <li>Love this....</li>

      <li>product, easy to use.</li>
      <li>Its easy to&lt;br /&gt;use</li>
      <li>It arrived very quickly.</li>
      <li>I like the dial to adjust the speed and the drill itself is comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>I also ordered a smoothing nail bit (from another website below) which allows you to go close to the cuticle and smooth acrylics or gels in the fill in area without getting cut.</li>
      <li>The bits sit in securely but they do not lock in, which is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
      <li>It doesnt even turn on , i was so excited to receive this since all the other reviews were great .</li>
      <li>The product arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>is worth</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
      <li>Right out of the box, the drill don&#x27;t turn on.</li>
      <li>I received my electric file super fast after ordering it, which was a plus and the price was very reasonable &amp;#34;)</li>
      <li>I cut down my salon budget by doing my own feet.</li>
      <li>it helps cut off so much filing time for my acrylic nails and def strong enough to work on acrylic nails.</li>
      <li>I feel like it should have been done right from the start so that paying customers don&#x27;t have to fix it or buy a new one.</li>
      <li>Only complain is that the tips don&#x27;t really fit the drill.</li>
      <li>The red light comes on, but nothing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll update my review if I find that they loosen with use, but for now this has fulfilled its purpose and was reasonably priced, being a product I&#x27;m using for myself in my home and not in a salon on a bunch of people.</li>
      <li>I would personally be more comfortable if they locked, but they just push in and hopefully remain tight enough for the life of the drill.</li>
      <li>Does not slow down and easy to use!</li>
      <li>It gets a little warm when used for long periods of time.</li>
      <li>br /&gt;It arrived fast and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
      <li>The drill bits included in the kit are helpful, but I needed one that smooths near the fill in area and was not included in this</li>
      <li>While the drill is a cheap price, I still feel like it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
      <li>Other than the whole breaking thing.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I originally posted a great review for this product, but since then, things have changed. One day the drill just didn&#x27;t turn back on. I took very good care of the drill so it&#x27;s definitely not user error. While the drill is a cheap price, I still feel like it&#x27;s a waste of my money. Sometimes cheap isn&#x27;t better. When it did work, it had a lot of vibration on the handle, so therefore there was a lot of vibration while using on clients. Heats up very quickly because of that. If this is your first drill, and you don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with drills, then it&#x27;s not so bad. Other than the whole breaking thing.  **EDIT** Opened it up and noticed that the soldering of the connections was done very poorly and/or lazely, re-soldered all of the connections and now it turns on again. So if this happens to you, don&#x27;t waste time and money trying to return it or replace it. It took just a coupe minutes and saved me money. I feel like it should have been done right from the start so that paying customers don&#x27;t have to fix it or buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Machine stopped working after five uses! What a waste.</li>
    <li> Love this nail kit. just  got it and can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> This is great for home use. I just started doing my own acrylic tips and I wanted a nail drill to speed up filing and buffing, and this fulfills that need. The bits sit in securely but they do not lock in, which is why I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5. I would personally be more comfortable if they locked, but they just push in and hopefully remain tight enough for the life of the drill. I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and the bits have stayed in and done what I expected them to do. I&#x27;ll update my review if I find that they loosen with use, but for now this has fulfilled its purpose and was reasonably priced, being a product I&#x27;m using for myself in my home and not in a salon on a bunch of people. I like the dial to adjust the speed and the drill itself is comfortable to hold. I feel it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m reasonably happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My friends daughter just started learning to do nails and she loves it!</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. Made well and has a lot of power.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!! it helps cut off so much filing time for my acrylic nails and def strong enough to work on acrylic nails. Love the clockwise/counterclockwise feature!! This is the best electrical drill for the price!!! BUY THIS!!!</li>
    <li> Great for natural nails and acrylic. Great range of power and speed. Includes all drill bits necessary for manicures and fullsets.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews. The product arrived quickly. The quality of the product is very good for the $.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to doing my nails using this drill.  I also ordered a smoothing nail bit (from another website below) which allows you to go close to the cuticle and smooth acrylics or gels in the fill in area without getting cut.

    <li> It doesnt even turn on , i was so excited to receive this since all the other reviews were great . However, it might have just been a defective one . i do want one that works ! PLEASE !</li>
    <li> The nail machine did not work.  The return was very easy though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice. But so far it&#x27;s been great. I got mines in two days, with extra charge of course. Only complain is that the tips don&#x27;t really fit the drill. Not sure if there&#x27;s a trick to it. I&#x27;ll keep working on it.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Received it faster than expected and works great! Does not slow down and easy to use!</li>
    <li> IN THE BEGGINING WAS OK, BUT SOON FAILED</li>
    <li> Great product.  I get tired of going to salons that charge a fortune for Pedicure and Manicure.  It is easy to use and works perfect for me and my family.  My boys love it.</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly. Very pleased.. Just received it. Right out of the box, the drill don&#x27;t turn on. The red light comes on, but nothing. Guess I&#x27;ll be contacting them for either a replacement or return. Keep you posted.</li>
    <li> Stopped working after like 10 uses!!! Waste of money-- Next time I wont take the cheap route and get the more expensive one!!! DONT BUY!</li>
    <li> I had not used it yet,  but checked it and it seems to work great. It arrived as promised.</li>
    <li> Works great and got here on time. Love it. I already started to use it. Will recommend to all my fellow nail techs</li>
    <li> If you have thick nails this is a savior. I cut down my salon budget by doing my own feet. I still get pedicures but I can shape my nails the way I want if it&#x27;s not done properly. I had two thick big toe nails and this machine change that. I love it!</li>
    <li> I received my electric file super fast after ordering it, which was a plus and the price was very reasonable &amp;#34;) The interesting thing is it doesen&#x27;t have a release button to remove/change the bit.  Its self-locking, you just take out the mandrel, change it and put it back&lt;br /&gt;in.  Feels very secure and does not feel like the bit will fall out during use.  I also like that the stand is purple and the hand piece has an on/off&lt;br /&gt;button as well as the unit.  Its easy to&lt;br /&gt;use and I am very happy with it &amp;#34;)</li>
    <li> Loved it!!&lt;br /&gt;I am doing my own nails instead getting them done at the salon. is worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;great product, easy to use.</li>
    <li> I am basically just learning how to use this machine. I love it&lt;br /&gt;It arrived fast and it was exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> The speed control did not work, so it only went one speed.</li>
    <li> Great for the price and works good. I had ordered a more expensive drill it did not work so I had to return it. I saw this one and thought  I would  try it. I&#x27;ve  had it over a year works great  for doing your nails at home.</li>
    <li> I love this e-file! It works great on toes and does magic when I use it on my acrylic nails. I do my own acrylics at home and this machine gives me salon quality nails. It gets a little warm when used for long periods of time. But mine has never over heated or stopped on me. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Love this....just as good as professional!!!!</li>
