      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>This thing allows me to do that to make sure I&#x27;m 100% clean after a shower.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This brush is only 16 inches long.  Someone said it was 18&amp;#34;.  Very disappointed when I received it.</li>
    <li> LIke the wooden handle. Have broken 3 other mesh brushes with plastic handles. this one&#x27;s great</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I had a stroke early last year and lost the use of one arm making it difficult if not impossible to reach body parts when taking a shower. This item solves that problem.</li>
    <li> wonderfully useful for lower legs and foot washing for the disabled.</li>
    <li> Items came as advertised and I am very satisfied with them.  The rest of this is added to satisfy Amazon&#x27;s inane length requirement, which I am too busy to fulfill.</li>
    <li> I first discovered this wonderful product many years ago.  I was staying over at a lady friend&#x27;s house after a heavy night of drinking and competitive Taco Bell Burrito Supreme eating when I stumbled into the bathroom.  After an exhaustive digestive system expose&#x27; I discovered, much to my drunken horror, that there was no toilet paper.  Fortunately I saw the AquaBella Exfoliating Mesh Brush sitting in the corner of the shower.  It worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and you find the constant purchasing of toilet paper to be both expensive and wasteful, then boy oh boy is this product designed for you!  I mean, who likes to wipe?  Not me.  Unfortunately people can always tell when you&#x27;re smuggling a peanut butter sandwich between your cheeks.  The AquaBella Exfoliating Mesh Brush solves this problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use with the 18 inch handle, and it is very comfortable too - as long as you don&#x27;t push too hard.  The Product Features indicate that it can last up to three months, but I have to disagree.  Within 10 uses I lost the mesh cleaning surface.  Well, I didn&#x27;t lose it; it just didn&#x27;t make the return trip.  I hope it&#x27;s biodegradable.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really complain. It&#x27;s OK. Great for the price, but just OK compared to my last one.  It&#x27;s pretty decent quality, but the scrubber is a little too soft and flimsy than I generally like.  But it does the job. I&#x27;ll probably stick with this one for as long as it lasts and then move on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d prefer something like this with a longer handle and with a way to replace the scrubber.  Maybe sell it with replacement scrubbers.</li>
    <li> Sturdy mesh brush and wooden handle . Really like it. Not flimsy like others I have used. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I had a knee replacement and needed hep in cleaning my feet, back, etc. This proved extremely helpful. I continue to use this as it is still great for the back. It is sturdy and the wooden no-slip handle is a plus. Very reasonably priced. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I agree with the comments that the scrubber is a bit flimsy, but I think the very sturdy handle makes up for it because you can use that to exert a lot more pressure. My only real complaint is that I wish it came in colors other than white--my body scrub stained the white mesh early on and now it looks a bit icky.</li>
    <li> I had a double fusion and this product is wonderful to get to the places I cannot.  I told my husband I wish I had it before the back surgery.  It is wonderful to get to those hard to reach places, such as the middle of the back.  It is nice and soft as well.  Some loofahs tend to be scratchy.  After my surgery there were several tender spots and this was a wonderful product to wash those areas and not irritate them.</li>
    <li> the length of this was long enough to reach my back but its pretty useless otherwise..it feels like nothing is rubbing against my skin when i used it, it barely scrubs my skin..better off using something else..so disappointed.</li>
    <li> 2nd time in shower rope falls off. 4th time using mesh head comes loose from stick and begins to unravel. My dog does like the handle when playing pitch and fetch.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase again or recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to help me bathe my elderly father.  He stands in the shower and I scrub him down with it using the long wand.  Much better than using a washcloth.</li>
    <li> Item was just what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> The ball is a bit small or does not feel like it exerts any pressure and the item is hard to hang on the wall because the cord is too thick for some suction cups I have.  Replaced the cord with a thinner one, over all it is satisfactory and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Came unraveled after about 10 days. useless.</li>
    <li> Hardly any sponge on this at all.less than half of another one that I have.very disappointed.I bought three and they are all the same.</li>
    <li> Fell apart during first use</li>
    <li> It performs its intended function well.</li>
    <li> This brush was given to me as part of rehabilitation therapy after a back surgery.  The therapist thought they did a really good job and allowed patients to wash various body parts without bending.  Now that I am better I use it to scrub the back, but right after the surgery it was able to wash my legs without bending too much as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The puff is made out of a nice material which is not too harsh, yet abrasive enough to feel exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle has a nice handy loop which I hang on the shower caddy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the size and the feel and I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. works well, though it could have a bit more of the mesh and a bit more tightly secured. The wand is very sturdy.</li>
    <li> I prefer one that has longer mesh thru the wooden holder, almost to the hand.  But on occasion I use this one also</li>
    <li> This is what I was looking for.  I can reach the middle of my back easily and the texture is just right.  Other brushes were too stiff and others fell apart.  I have been using this one now for a couple of months and it&#x27;s still holding together.  If it fall apart in the future I will buy two more of the same thing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this every day since it arrived. It works great for the back and for all those hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> Would have given more stars but the pad already seem s to be coming off the stick</li>
    <li> Works great, and very handy to reach difficult to reach areas. Would definitely buy again</li>
    <li> Replacing one I really liked, this one is less &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; .  By the way, I highly recommend Aveeno Active Naturals Fragrance Free Skin Relief Body Wash, Soothing Oatmeal no matter what you use to apply it.</li>
    <li> I love it. No problems at all!! The wooden handle is best, doesn&#x27;t break. Was sent in a decent time and handled well.</li>
    <li> Does the job.  Put body lotion on it in shower and apply.</li>
    <li> This was a great gift to give to my college daughter.&lt;br /&gt;It is still in good shape to use. Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> Yes, the head is flimsy, but It does soap up well and does what it is intended to do.&lt;br /&gt;Cannot complain for the price.</li>
    <li> The slightly curved handle makes it easy to scrub harder on spots, especially since mesh doesn&#x27;t scrub as hard as brushes. The mesh is tough and maintains its shape and integrity even after months of usage.</li>
    <li> The string isn&#x27;t attached all that well and mine fell off.  Otherwise, it works as intended, I haven&#x27;t noticed any quality issues.</li>
    <li> Works great - just what you&#x27;d hope/expect. I can reach everything that needs reaching, but an extra inch or two would make it ideal!</li>
    <li> Just a wad on a stick.  When you use it the wad rolls back and the stick rubs against your body.  It just sucks.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> The brush is what I was looking for to help reach hard spaces after surgery.  I plan on keeping the brush hanging in the shower, best thing ever.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the money but it not very good quality. It&#x27;s been a couple of months and it&#x27;s coming apart already.</li>
    <li> Nice to reach the hard and close places. Great for recovering from surgery, and for people that want to be independent.</li>
    <li> Due to recent surgeries on both shoulders, I have limited use of my arms. This product allows me to wash my back without much stress on my shoulders.</li>
    <li> The handle is not waterproof and started rotting after two weeks. You can either rub oil into it to preserve it or seal it somehow. I am disappointed that a company makes a shower tool that can&#x27;t withstand use in water.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed that these are not a full 18\\&quot; which would make it&lt;br /&gt;easier to reach the middle of the back.&lt;br /&gt;The ball of mesh is pretty much useless for soaping up, so will just go&lt;br /&gt;to a BB&amp;B and check out what they have.</li>
    <li> Well made and serves its purpose.</li>
    <li> It does exactly what you think it does. It reaches the parts of your back that your little T-Rex arms cannot reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re welcome.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Very glad to find one with a wooden handle -- the plastic handled ones break so easily.  Also, the Mesh ball is not as fluffy as the plastic handled versions I have used and that is is good thing -- they work better.  Very well pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Within a week, the scrubbie part started moving due to being attached loosely and the result was I was jsut stabbing myself in the back with a stick because it would just shift when I tried to use it on my skin. I&#x27;ve been using this type of thing for many years and never had that problem. The only issue I have it the plastic ones usually break after a year+ so I thought a wooden one might fix that problem, but it was WAY worse.</li>
    <li> Wood handle gives a lot of stability to mesh brush, handle also is slightly angled for easier hard to reach areas.  I find this item useful for legs, feet and back.</li>
    <li> Good deal for around $5 bucks~! The brush head is a tad small but no complaints.  The brush hasn&#x27;t unraveled on me yet which I a good sign as many do. String holder on base came undone within 60 days.  This looks like a 12 month product hopefully longer.</li>
    <li> soft loofah - splits in the middle so the wood part sticks out when you&#x27;re trying to scrub.</li>
    <li> Product as described.</li>
    <li> These are not well made. The material comes loose from the stick very easily.&lt;br /&gt;These used to be made very well but lately- no good !</li>
    <li> If you use this brush for other than your back, it will get worn it out fast, and the poofy thing will get loose and you will need another one. I recommend the [[ASIN:B000I20Q72 Aquis Exfoliating Back Scrubber]] instead.</li>
    <li> I like it, my husband does not.  the head is a little to small….size of a tennis ball.</li>
    <li> The brush is not evenly distributed on the handle, the string broke the first day i got it.  I had a better version i bought from walmart but it wore out after a few years.  I expect this to last maybe a few months. I recommend buying a more expensive one or atleast being able to test the scrubbing portion so you dont feel like your washing yourself with a stick.</li>
    <li> Just want I wanted..an easy way to get to my back.  Love to use Philosophy and my brush.</li>
    <li> I like this bath brush. The wooden handle seems sturdy and the netting is nice. Great product for the price.</li>
    <li> Pour on a little body wash and scrub up!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this one.  I don&#x27;t see how they can call it &amp;#34;exfoliating.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m like to use a back brush, and this just felt like a piece of fluff going over my back.  The handle also was arched into a position that didn&#x27;t quite seem normal to me.  It is made out of the same thing as the &amp;#34;puffs&amp;#34; people use for washing with liquid soap, so if you are into liquid soap, this might be for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these and I keep buying them. I only wish it was a little more durable. The string used to hang it up falls off after a week or two. That&#x27;s not a dealbreaker, though. The luffa part stays on for quite some time but eventually falls out as well. Usually by then it&#x27;s time to buy a new one anyway.</li>
    <li> I like these for washing hard-to-reach areas, but my last one I purchased did not last very long. It quickly came untethered from the wood handle and just sort of dangled off the end of it. I still used it, but it didn&#x27;t really work very well. I probably won&#x27;t be buying another one.</li>
    <li> maybe its just our house, but these never last for us. initially, its a fine product, but you find that the interior gets moldy quickly and you want a stronger bristle on the head of it to work harder for getting dead skin off.</li>
    <li> The handle is long enough to reach all of one&#x27;s back, thick, heavy enough to hold liquid soap and cleanse well.  All that needs saying.</li>
    <li> What I expect it is not that kin of</li>
    <li> This Exfoliating Mesh Brush is exactly the right length for washing my back as my arms are unable to reach the middle of my back.  I particularly like the fact that this brush is gentle, not like a loofah which can be very irritating to the skin.  I&#x27;m not sure that it is  really exfoliating, but it does a good job of cleaning.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s on the nice side of just okay - it was the only slightly scrubby thing on a stick I could find (the loofas all seem to fall off after a few uses based on reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s held up well so far&lt;br /&gt;Sturdy handle&lt;br /&gt;Nice pouf (yes, I&#x27;m laughing as I write this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not scrubby enough for something that&#x27;s advertised as &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you might want to try building your own</li>
    <li> I had to buy my pregnant wife this to help wash her legs and back. She says she loves it. Can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare it with, but I am using it.  The only problem is that the handle is long, and I am short.</li>
    <li> Decent quality, nice grip, works like it&#x27;s supposed to!</li>
    <li> Handle is STURDY - not like plastic...just what I was looking for!  Love how it is curved slightly.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I was looking for. Its well made and has held together for a long time which is saying something considering I use it to scrub the grime off me that I get from working on oil rigs.</li>
    <li> Useless, so soft it&#x27;s like a cotton ball being rubbed on the back - no exfoliation or scrubbing power at all! I think I&#x27;ll give it to my neighbor&#x27;s dog for a chew toy.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curved handle is great for easily reaching the middle of my back.  It&#x27;s similar to one I bought at Wal-Mart a year ago, but I think this one is actually less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None that I know of.</li>
    <li> Broke after 2 months.  Should last much longer.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and glad I could find this product on line</li>
    <li> I wanted the long handle to reach my back, but in the end, it just gets in the way most of the time.  It is still handy to have a handle, but I kind of wish it was a little bit shorter.  Otherwise, its held up well, and does the job as a loofah</li>
    <li> An essential bath item in planning, but very shoddy execution.  Note the disclaimer \\&quot;lasts UP TO three months.\\&quot;  Doesn&#x27;t: the pouf falls of of the stick after about two weeks of light use.  Could easily be constructed to last far longer.  Disappointing: avoid.</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. It lathers up really nicely and I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
    <li> This worked exactly as I wanted it to.  I use it to wash my back and also to apply lotion in the shower.  It is soft, not something you would use to scrub your skin like a loofa.  It is great for sensitive skin.  The handle is just long enough to be able to reach to the middle of your back.</li>
    <li> The staple that holds it on is on the wrong side making its use awkward.</li>
    <li> This is great!  We use it everyday--excellent size and reach.</li>
    <li> Brought this to use after having  hip replacement surgery and it is much better than the brush with plastic handle the hospital gave me to use.  the wooden handle  doesn&#x27;t slip out of my hand like the plastic does. Highly recommend this on.</li>
    <li> I find that this product has three major flaws.  First, the wood handle&#x27;s finish makes holding it difficult when it&#x27;s wet; it&#x27;s too slippery.  Second, the handle needs to be curved more for ease in washing the back.  Lastly, the handle would benefit from being a bit longer.  The quality is fine, but the design is lacking.</li>
    <li> These work great. Good for the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> Nice long-handled scrub brush. I purchased this following hip surgery, which I wouldn&#x27;t be able to bend and reach in the shower. This brush is so much nicer (and cheaper!) than the surgical supply long-handled sponge.</li>
    <li> Good strong brush that reaches all the hard to reach areas. Has a nice string to hang and dry in the shower. Makes a nice long handheld microphone when your favorite song comes on the radio. Rinses out easily and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> This brush is sturdily constructed, and previous ones like it have lasted a long time without the handle breaking (like plastic ones do) or the scrubber thing coming undone (and who knew that those things are made of 20 feet of mesh?). The string at the end of the handle did come unknotted, but I tied it again and gave it a couple of extra knots, all seems well. I recommend shaking the excess water out of this after use, and hanging it to dry.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing fancy about this back scrubber.  It just works, and it&#x27;s inexpensive.  The wooden handle is fairly long and has a good, curved shape for reaching your back.  It feels more solid than the plastic ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the simplest design is the best one.  This is one of those times.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband wanted.  I like the wooden handle.  Ordered more for the kids. They like it also. Yay!</li>
    <li> Perfect for reaching your back</li>
    <li> I can react all of my back and the bottom of my feet. Good quality.</li>
    <li> So far brush has held up ok. The tie for hanging it up keeps coming untied. But that doesn&#x27;t affect how well it scrubs your back. Holds lather quite well and so far hasn&#x27;t came apart like so many of these type back scrubbers tend to do.</li>
    <li> I am rating this as 5 star as it is for exactly suited for people who have sensitive skin like me. I used bath brush earlier which was little harsh on my back skin. The mesh with this product is of good quality. It is gentle on the skin and helps mild cleaning. A value for money!!!.</li>
    <li> Used for 2 months now. Wood handle is fine, no mildew fungus or warping. Mesh scrub is still intact and not unfurling. Rope hang came undone after one week and never stays knotted after retrying. Works fine otherwise and can&#x27;t say much more for a bath brush. Just annoying rope hang issues with every use. Subtle detail but gross aggravation.</li>
    <li> This is not so much a scrubber as a shower sponge on a long handle. I was pleasantly surprised at how long the item was (18\\&quot; from end to end; about 16.5\\&quot; for the wooden handle). It has a great grip - I&#x27;ve had plastic scrubbers that get slippery when wet. The indentations and the wood material make this much easier to use than those. It is also just flexible enough to reach the indentations on your back, but stiff enough to actually clean those areas. I also suspect that you could replace the sponge if you want to be environmentally friendly - it seems to be fixed in the middle and is probably replaceable with a little ingenuity. I may order a set of [[ASIN:B001CTQMIC Aquasentials Mesh Pouf Sponge (4 Pack)]] to try this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this \\&quot;brush\\&quot; shines is in reaching areas that are difficult to clean. Not only the back, but feet - when you reach a \\&quot;certain age\\&quot; you don&#x27;t bend quite as well. I also bought an expensive sponge with an articulated handle, but this reaches much better and is more comfortable.  This sponge-on-a-stick lathers up well: wet it, squirt shower gel onto it, then rub with your hand to get the lather going. It reaches all the places I could not quite reach unaided. And it seems to be just soft enough to be pleasant to use, while strong enough to clean well.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long but so far it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to and not coming apart at all!</li>
    <li> Everything I hoped for and more; shipped promptly and well packaged; would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> What can i say.....when you live alone you need some way to wash your back.....unless of course you don&#x27;t care about it.  Great company and great product...very well made!</li>
    <li> Mesh not firmly attached to wooden handle - when using it, the mesh flops to one side and the hard handle tip scratches your skin.</li>
    <li> Typical supermarket loofah (though not a crappy one) attached to a stick. Does its job, not a disappointment.</li>
    <li> It has been in use for over 2 weeks and seems to be really well made. It&#x27;s great for my husband to scrub his back so that he can use the body wash back there since he can&#x27;t reach it with his arms.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and worth the price.  The brush section material is very good and the stick is just long enough to get to the hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> This is a plain and simple tool; I needed it for post-surgery bathing and am enjoying it very much.  The wooden handle is strong and the mesh is attached well.  It rinses clean easily...so I&#x27;d say it does just what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t scrub good. I got this to scrub my back but it feels weak.</li>
    <li> Flimsy and not enough poof material</li>
    <li> This product had all the features I was looking for (curved wooden handle, poofy sponge on the end) but when put to use it just did not work as I hoped.  The sponge is so flimsy it does not clean very well.  I can&#x27;t get it to actually stay on the skin.  It&#x27;s like trying to wash my back with a wad of Kleenex!  I will not be ordering anymore of these.</li>
    <li> Yuck.  I had this hanging in my shower and used it several times.  It always had the chance to dry properly, but the stick portion grew mold inside of the loofah.  I had to toss it.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> I thought the mesh would be a little fuller, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
    <li> So i have back acne due to the fact that i just can&#x27;t get back there to scrub and wash it with soap or body wash or whatever. this mesh brush does it&#x27;s job well, good reach without being too long and it is a good balance between rough and soft mesh. Enough to get a good scrub without being too rough. The arch that the handle has is very effective and the handle seems to be good quality, overall a good product for a good price that i am satisfied with.</li>
    <li> Only complaint is the cord keeps coming untied.</li>
    <li> Works, but seems a little cheap</li>
    <li> looks great its a awesome product no complains here. This product does have a short life but i think you all expect that its a wash cloth brush thing of a gig.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a barrel chested guy, not overweight at all, but I just can&#x27;t reach the center of my back regularly.  This thing allows me to do that to make sure I&#x27;m 100% clean after a shower.  Brush is attached well, handle has the nice hangy rope thingy and the finger holds which helps when soap is involved.  Great product vs. the others where the head just falls off after a few uses.  I&#x27;ve used it probably 100 times and it is still holding up like new.</li>
    <li> The first day that I used it, the little rope came apart. Then, the mesh itself fell apart. I should&#x27;ve returned it, but I just threw it away in disgust. I would absolutely NOT recommend this product. I would recommend buying a similar mesh brush at your local Wal-Mart. I&#x27;ve had far better luck with those.</li>
    <li> I bought this same brush previously and it was great.  The string holding the poof together eventually came apart after a few years.  So I bought the same brush again last month.  This time it had like a third of the poof and it was tied on very loosely so that when I actually tried to scrub my back, the poof would flop over like a dead fish and the bare end of the handle did the scrubbing.  Pure junk.  I tried to return it, but just missed the return window.  Very dissapointed.</li>
    <li> This works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to - unglamorous, not especially good looking, but if you like your back clean, get one.</li>
    <li> The Mesh Brush is equivalent to the ones I have purchased at the Drug Store.  I like the length of it to reach my back in the shower.</li>
    <li> my husband loves this!! great accessory for the shower!!</li>
    <li> These items are hard to find locally, so I purchased one on Amazon. The scrubber does exactly what I expected; helping me reach those spots on my back I can no longer get to otherwise. After about 3 years the head came apart and I had to replace - but I feel I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> This pouf is sturdy, and durable! The mesh pouf &#x27;s quantity is more than sufficient and firmly attached. The wooden handle is sturdy and I&#x27;d say unbreakable. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it could of been just a little bit longer for my needs with my current bending restrictions after surgery. I&#x27;m sure as I heal, this product will turn into 5 stars.</li>
    <li> My whole family has one. This product is great where as you don&#x27;t have to bend down to wash your legs or your feet and it is great to wash your back. I dries very fast and it save on washcloths also it takes less liquid soap to lather. I am 50yrs. old and lots of accidents happen in the shower. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> I think it looks nicer than plastic. Having in white looks better than garish colors to me. The little string loop fell off immediately. Use glue to be sure the ends of it are glued. I do find it takes more soap than my worn out pouf in order to get a lather... Perhaps it has a bit too much material. I suspect from others I have seen this is true of many of the handled models. Otherwise, it is what it is.</li>
    <li> Reaches all those parts you can not reach in the shower. Leathers up great with the liquid soap.</li>
    <li> OK...I get it is a $5 back brush. It does have a great wooden handle and a full soft brush end but the damn thing comes untied after using it. BOING!! the strings on 3 out of 4 brushes were either never tied or the company&#x27;s 2 year old tied it but forget the over the fill and thru the tunnel part!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just means you end up with this wad of brush end and tying it back in place is impossible. For this item the next best selection is a corn cob or ti a rag on a broomstick...it will last longer.</li>
    <li> The handle was great! It was curved with finger indentations - making it easy to hold. However, the string holding the pouf to the handle was very loose, allowing the pouf to flop around when using it. I ended up reattaching the pouf with my own string, and it works better now. I would also prefer if the pouf were larger, or denser. I&#x27;ll probably be replacing the pouf with a different, larger one; but, I&#x27;ll be keeping the handle!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a quality loofah for a long time and this one is. They call it \\&quot;Aquasentials Exfoliating Mesh Brush\\&quot; but it is a soft mesh material that is the same as a loofah.</li>
    <li> I am well over seventy and recently broke a hip.  It was very difficult to shower until we ordered this.  I lather the mesh  well with bar soap and scrub all those body parts which so need attention: back, underarms, legs, ankles, and feet. My shower has once again become a pleasure instead of an endurance and agility contest. The quality is excellent and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> just the right size and shape</li>
    <li> Its a good scrub brush. It didn&#x27;t unravel while using it. Its long enough to reach those harder areas. I like it.</li>
    <li> Loofa was a little smaller than expected, but it keeps my ass clean.</li>
    <li> A very inexpensive product that lasts very well. Got it to be able to really clean and exfoliate those hard to reach places like the middle of the back.</li>
    <li> Very good idea. Still working.</li>
    <li> As described...fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Great product and very well made.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but the white fluffy part is not fully affixed to the wooden handle, so it&#x27;s coming off in places.  It&#x27;s still functional but kind of a pain to use.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kinda difficult to use for the majority of your body, but it&#x27;s perfect for those hard to reach places!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just a loofa tied to a wooden stick with a flimsy string.  It would be the same if you bought a loofa, took a wooden stick, drilled two holes at the end and tied the loofa to it.  After a couple weeks the loofa doesn&#x27;t stay in place on the end of the stick and keeps moving around so it is impossible to scrub your back with it.  I ended up just cutting off the loofa and using the loofa by itself.  I bought a much much better back scrubbing brush from Target for $3.99 which has a rectangular shaped loofa firmly attached to both sides of the end of the handle.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s nice. seems substantial, and well made. hoping it lasts, but only time will tell. I need even more words.</li>
    <li> Does  all I had hoped for--better and milder than most brushes. Easy to use. Cleans up well. DOes not hold water, so dries fast--good.</li>
    <li> im a big guy who needs a durable brush. THIS brush is the bomb! its soft, its wood handle aint gonna break when i wash. buy this. buy it. don&#x27;t even think about it and just buy it. you will not regret your decision to purchase this soft majestic angel soft body brush.</li>
    <li> After my son was injured in a football accident, his ability to reach the right spots when showering were not possible.  This long yet soft shower attachment really hit all the right spots.  He loves it and its being well used even after his rehabilitation has been over!</li>
    <li> This shower brush is superior to any I have found in drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;I love the wooden handle on it.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I bought two at the same time.</li>
    <li> Works out great and cleans all those hard to reach areas.</li>
    <li> A pretty basic back scrubber - the puff is a good size and not too abrasive</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t reach my back and it drives me insane knowing that my back went unwashed after I took showers. Insane I tell you. So I bought this and BAM! Problem solved. No more not washing my back during a shower barbaric ways</li>
    <li> The handle is sturdy and the poof stays together and creates plenty of lather.  This is a good product.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> I know this is a bath and back brush but I use it to clean my enormous jetted tub.  No more stretching and climbing in the tub!  Works great - good purchase.</li>
    <li> After only about 8 showers the scrubbing part flopped around loosely and the wood where it was attached was sharp and scraped me!</li>
    <li> Excellent brush , bought a couple for my parents and more for us.</li>
    <li> The sturdy handle makes it very easy to use, and the mesh pouf has stayed together very well over several months of daily use.</li>
    <li> Good brush that does its job.</li>
    <li> Love this brush, i&#x27;m handicap from a stroke and its great in the shower ,thank you for making them...after I used it for 3 months in shower, before i throw it away i use it to clean my baseboards its great</li>
    <li> Still using it. For those of us that aren&#x27;t so flexible anymore, this makes it a bit easier to get your back and shoulders scrubbed.</li>
    <li> The product has a long handle that have a curve to it.  It is wonderful for the hard to reach places.</li>
    <li> This worked for a little while, then the pouf loosened from the handle and just flopped around.  The pouf is held on with a thick string, and the string stretched so that the bath pouf was not held on securely.  I just had to by a new one from a different site.</li>
    <li> This extended body cleaner is working well. It is not really a brush. It is a Pouf on a stick. It accepts shower gel and holds long term suds. I use it not only for my back, but also for my lower legs and feet. A minor complaint is that the Pouf is slightly stiffer than the stand alone Pouf, but within acceptable usage condition.</li>
    <li> It does its job well and has lasted thus far (1 month in). I will see how much longer it holds out.</li>
    <li> The mesh is like all others at the brick and mortar stores.  The best reason for buying this loofah is the wooden handle!  It will not bend and will not break.  You have the ability to apply pressure on hard to reach places, especially behind the back.</li>
    <li> Great for backs--does not work well for between toes--too big.  The long handle makes it convenient for those of use who cannot bend over.</li>
    <li> The exfoliating mesh brush is working out great. It feels good on the skin and I can reach all the areas that I need to with ease.</li>
