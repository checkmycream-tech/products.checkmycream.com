    <li> I have dry eyes and this ointment really helps. It is especially good for my left eye. I lost  sight in that eye when I was very young and it has a tendency to become very sore and to pick up little infections. I use Lakri-lube in the eye before bed and the eye stays comfortable.  As another reviewer said, this stuff is hard to find in my local drug store, and it costs less on Amazon.  I tried a generic store brand once, but it was too thin.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick to the real thing, it works for me. .</li>
    <li> Lacri Libe is an excellent night-time eye lubricant.  I&#x27;ve used it for years at bedtime.</li>
    <li> I have been using lacrilube as prescribed by my ophthalmologist for a couple of years and find Amazon to be a great source for the product.</li>
    <li> Works well for my dry eyes.</li>
    <li> It Burn and dryed out my eyes more</li>
    <li> I use t his one since it is hard to find lacrilube in Pharmacy these days, and it is just as good, an essential for taking care of corneas while I am asleep...</li>
    <li> I have Chronic Dry Eyes syndrome. This is a chronic disease that can be caused by advanced age, contact lens wear, certain medications, eye diseases, other medical conditions, or environmental factors. One type of Chronic Dry Eye disease is caused by reduced tear production due to inflammation. My eyes may not just feel dry - I also experience other uncomfortable, even painful symptoms like burning, stinging, sensitivity to light, blurry vision, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ophthalmologist recommended that I use I use Refresh Lacri-Lube Lubricant Eye Ointment at night. Since I have been using this ointment my condition has improved. I also wear an eye mask, like the kind they used to give out during plane flights. The mask keeps my eyes from fluttering during the times when I am dreaming and keeps moisture in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eye doctor also recommended that I use Refresh Tears Lubricant Eye Drops frequently during the day. I know this may get to be expensive but this is the only product that relieves my symptoms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, both Refresh products are outstanding!!&lt;br /&gt;JANA</li>
    <li> Lacrilube is a very good emollient for persons experiencing severe dry eye.  I would encourage it&#x27;s use to anyone having this condition.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lacri-Lube for about 30 years.  All of a sudden, my store did not carry it any more.  So I promptly got on Amazon, and of course, there it was.  I have extremely dry eyes, and eye drops do not help at all.  I would be lost without Lacri-Lube.  I can always depend on Amazon, and now that I am an Amazon Prime member, many of my purchases have free shipping.  Plus I get free Amazon on my Netflix.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great product.</li>
    <li> I have Sjogrens which causes insanely dry eyes especially at night. I used to wake up several times a night to reapply other night time eye ointments and I&#x27;ve tried them all. This one stays in. It doesn&#x27;t give you that immediate thirst quenching ahhhh that the runnier ones do but for a long night it keeps on going. It feels a bit like petroleum jelly in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I was told to get this to help with morning dry eye. It does work but it&#x27;s like putting in grease under your eye lid.  So forget seeing anything once it&#x27;s in.</li>
    <li> I had a hemorrhage in my eye and went to the ER because I had never gotten anything like that before and it looked scary.  The ER doctor recommended Lacri-Lube.  It worked great and in three or 4 days time my eye was completely better.  I followed up with an eye doctor for a checkup, and they were happy with how it had worked for me.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as intended! Though caution your eyes are a little blurry the following 10+ mins or so, maybe 5-30 minutes depends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they lubricate good but it comes out as a paste like toothpaste so its hard to get it to fall off into your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff for dry eyes, GREAT!</li>
    <li> Arrived as projected and in condition</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product. all that is required is small tab and it lasts&lt;br /&gt;all night. The next morning there is almost no blurring.if there is it disappears&lt;br /&gt;within a half hour.</li>
    <li> I have very dry eyes and find that PuroLube is much more effective in moistening my eyes during sleep than Lacri-Lube.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply. It gives immediate relief along with overnight relief also. For very dry eyes in need of comfort do not hesitate to use!!</li>
    <li> This product is hard to find in the stores.  It came fast and cost a lot less. It is the only way I&#x27;ll get it now</li>
    <li> This product is the very best for dry eye syndrome.  The price is terrific when compared to drugstore prices and the service was excellent.</li>
    <li> I must use this every night or I wake up with painful dry eyes.  I had lasik about 10 years ago and developed dry eyes.  I do use prescription restasis but need a little boost of moisture at night since I sleep without closing my eyes all the way (according to my doctor).  This ointment is a life saver for me.  I tried several other kinds which were too thick and a few actually made my eyes feel dryer.  I like this because I can still watch TV after using it and it wipes off in the morning easily with a soft towel and a little saline.</li>
