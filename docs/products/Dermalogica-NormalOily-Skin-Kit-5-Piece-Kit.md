    <li> I really like to so far. No skin irritation. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Works great, I just wish the kit had larger bottles</li>
    <li> I have used this product for while and I love it- I was just re-stocking</li>
    <li> great way to try the products at a low price I&#x27;ll be buying the full size versions these are great</li>
    <li> The perfect travel set or great use at home for a complete facial treatment.</li>
    <li> Would buy again. This kit had good value and left my face feeling clean. Did not dry out or leave oily! I recommend this kit for people who are unsure of the product and want to try out prior to buying the latger sizes.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing but it&#x27;s smaller than it looks!</li>
    <li> According to the listing for this product, this kit is supposed to contain:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The Dermalogica Oily Skin Kit Includes: Dermal Clay Cleanser 1.7oz Multi-Active Toner 1.7oz Oil Control Lotion .75oz Skin Prep Scrub .75oz Soothing Eye Make-Up Remover (sample) Skin Refining Masque (sample)\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, what will actually be sent to you is the normal/oily kit which does not contain any of the above products. I instead received the special cleansing gel, skin prep scrub, multi active toner, active moist and total eye care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to re-order from another seller who accurately describes their products.</li>
    <li> My wife used to use Dermalogica religiously but hasn&#x27;t for a few years. This was a great way for her to sample multiple products and decide if she really wanted/needed them all.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to try out dermalogica products for a while but the prices are pretty high so I decided to go with the kit. I love it! Every time I use the products I feel like I&#x27;m giving myself a facial and my skin feels very refreshed. I love every product and would recommend this to anyone. I have sensitive skin and have had problems with other products in the past but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this kit (I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week). I also notice that the acne and rosacea around my mouth/cheeks is less prominent.</li>
    <li> Great product. My skin looked better in just two days. This set gives you a little of all the best in the line.</li>
    <li> So far, so good, skin feels better.</li>
    <li> My skin feels fantastic after using the products in this pack. I just love it!</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!! Definitely a great travel kit or sample set. I actually loved every single product in this bunch and will be getting more for sure</li>
    <li> I really like scrub and eye cream from this kit, definitely, will buy them again. The scrub cleans pores and removes dry skin perfectly. Eye cream really nourishes and moisturies my undereye sensitive areas. However, the active moisture face cream is awful for my combination sensitive skin. It really burns on sensitive areas. Toner and cleanser are good, but do know better choices from other brands, will not repeat them.</li>
    <li> Great stuff but like the ultra calming line better</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Love love my skin, people ask me how my skin looks so great.</li>
