<li> For anybody looking to purchase a BaByliss flat iron, visit this website to view authorized dealers:</li>

<li> She said hers worked as well as the other more expensive flat irons.  </li>
<li> 2 other friends bought the same iron be side</li>
<li> , just wash it dry it and use it</li>
<li> My hair is long, thick, and curly, and it straightens in so little time and is so gentle on my hair!</li>
<li> Just be careful, it can burn you.</li>
<li> so you can&#x27;t touch them to clamp down on your hair tighter.</li>
<li> This iron seems to keep my hair than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried!  </li>
<li> I straighten my hair in half the time I used to.</li>
<li> So now I am selling them for half the price I paid for them.</li>
<li> I have really long, thick hair</li>
<li> and I cut my straightening time down by a half hour!</li>
<li> I purchased three of these BaByliss flat irons as Christmas gifts for my daughters through Amazon from Bachelorette Superstore Inc.  After about a month of use (after the return date had passed) the cord attached at the base of ALL THREE of the flat irons came loose, causing sparks and burns and rendering the three flat irons completely useless.  </li>
<li> I have really thick hair and the Baby Bliss works in minutes to straighten my hair.</li>
<li> The one I got was not a good product at all for the price.</li>
<li> If your hair got fried you probably used the wrong setting.</li>
<li> I ordered it, but HomeClick has failed to deliver it, I am waiting for my refund</li>
<li> I hate the stickiness those products give my hair.</li>
<li> This straightener is awful!</li>

    <li> great product.  perfect heat settings.  totally satisfied with my purchase.  My last straightener that I had for years finally burnt out and I was scared I wouldn&#x27;t find one good enough to replace it.  well - this has exceeded my expectations.  great brand and great product</li>
    <li> This straightener is seriously amazing! I have tried all of the top, name-brand straighteners and this one is the best by far. One swipe on hair and it&#x27;s perfectly straight and the temperature setting are great. Just be careful, it can burn you. (:</li>
    <li> it takes no time at all to straighten my hair! and this heats up fast!</li>
    <li> Babyliss pro nano titanium es un excelente articulo, lo que vi por amazon, es lo que recibí, rápido y en la fecha pautada.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I straighten my hair in half the time I used to. I have thick wavy/curly and incredible frizzy hair. I&#x27;ve never been the kind of person to buy an entire set for keeping my hair straight(gel/sprays/serums...etc). I hate the stickiness those products give my hair. With this iron the only thing I use, and recommend,  is a heat protection spray. This product keeps my hair straight, smooth and soft all day. It also has a 4 year warranty which many other flat irons only have a 1 year. This is the first flat iron that finally put my hair in place. Please find the setting that&#x27;s right for you. I&#x27;ve read reviews where people say that their hair got fried. If your hair got fried you probably used the wrong setting.</li>
    <li> After reading tons of reviews on flat irons, I decided to ask my stylist which product I should purchase.  She recommended BaByliss.  She said is was a great value for the money.  She said hers worked as well as the other more expensive flat irons.  She was correct!! My daughter and I have very thick curly hair and this product did a great job quickly flattening our hair.  I would recommend this product to you.  I had returned a Chi and a Sedu before settling on this one.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Los felicito buena atencion los recomiendo, la plancha es excelente deja el cabello brillante para uso profesional es increiblee, con respecto a la recepcion fue rapido y en buen estado,</li>
    <li> This really is a great product. Does exactly what I needed it to do. I have very coarse and curly hair. Its so smooth and straight and soft and nice to the touch. It feels like hair for the first time in my life instead of steel wool. I feel pretty good about my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;Now one thing....this thing does get HOT so must use caution and read instructions and make sure you use right temp for hair.</li>
    <li> This hair straightener is better than I expected. My hair is long, thick, and curly, and it straightens in so little time and is so gentle on my hair!</li>
    <li> I have had my flatiron for over a year now, and it still works perfectly since the day i got it. super happy about this product!</li>

    <li> I purchased three of these BaByliss flat irons as Christmas gifts for my daughters through Amazon from Bachelorette Superstore Inc.  After about a month of use (after the return date had passed) the cord attached at the base of ALL THREE of the flat irons came loose, causing sparks and burns and rendering the three flat irons completely useless.  After dealing with the seller who would not stand by their product in any way at all, I had to return the product to the manufacturer only to be told I had been sold a counterfeit product and was out my money.  I was VERY DISSATISFIED with the seller and their LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY for selling a counterfeit product.  DO NOT PURCHASE from this seller, unless you want the hassle of faulty, counterfeit products.

    <li> I bought this in an attempt to straighten my hair. At the time I had forgotten that I do not know how to do hair... LOL! So now I am selling them for half the price I paid for them.</li>
    <li> Honestly I ordered this product because my friend got it and i tried it, and it was excellent! I LOVED it, It helps me straighten my curly frizzy hair in no time, its titanum integrated ceramin heaters hide my split ends! I ordered it, but HomeClick has failed to deliver it, I am waiting for my refund so i can re-purcace it!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended to:&lt;br /&gt;Women with very curly frizzy hair! It will hel you style your hair in NO TIME! Trust me!</li>

    <li> All products are of excellent quality and I liked all all are very good and met all expectations I had of them and very good service if amazon.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best flat iron for the hair that I have ever used.  I have wavy and mostly frizzy hair especially when there is a lot of humidity or rain which there is in Florida.  I was amazed after going to the hair dresser and she used it on my hair 3 days later and my hair was still straight without any frizz at all.  I finally purchased one for me and it still has the same affect I love, love this brand and I don&#x27;t even have to use another products on my hair, just wash it dry it and use it and it stays straight for days!  I just recently purchased another one but a one inch to have as a back up.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have really long, thick hair and I cut my straightening time down by a half hour! Quick and hot.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing. It gets super hot and my hair has not looked so straight and silky like this. Very easy to use and a great price</li>
    <li> This iron seems to keep my hair than any other I&#x27;ve ever tried!  I don&#x27;t even put it on one of the hottest setting; I have naturally CURLY hair and it works great!</li>
    <li> This straightener is awful! I have flat irons from target that I spent $20 on that work better than this. It does not get hot enough but the plates get hot so you can&#x27;t touch them to clamp down on your hair tighter. Sally&#x27;s has much better  high-end straighteners for half the price that work great.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on a hair straightener but I wanted my hair to look like it does when I leave the salon. I am SO happy with this straightener!!! Cuts my straightening time in half and it stays straight for days. I love it, totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> eu ainda nao recebi oproduto, poi moro no Brasil e nao foi entregue a tempo enquanto estive nos EUA, aguardo a entrga dos correios para meu endereço.</li>
    <li> I liked this product but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. It looks cheap. The heat gets very hot. So far I like the way it works. I just wish it didn&#x27;t look so cheap.</li>
    <li> excellent product, works great, I buy another, thanks for watching for purchases made through this website, gracias por todo, muy bueno</li>
    <li> I got my babyliss today. Wow! Sure love this product. At first I wasn&#x27;t to convince about buying it, first of all because I had \\&quot;the TruCeramic pro\\&quot; loved the flat iron until it broke. I did my research and I found the babyliss to be good not only because its thicker but all the good ratings it had. Now I can say that I trust the ratings on here. My hair is super straight and spend less time doing it.</li>
